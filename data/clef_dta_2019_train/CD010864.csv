CD010864,0,22072293,0,The combination of four different clinical decision rules and an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off increases the number of patients in whom acute pulmonary embolism can safely be excluded.,"Four clinical decision rules (CDRs) (Wells score, Revised Geneva Score (RGS), simplified Wells score and simplified RGS) safely exclude pulmonary embolism (PE), when combined with a normal D-dimer test. Recently, an age-adjusted cut-off of the D-dimer (patient's age x 10 Î¼g/l) safely increased the number of patients above 50 years in whom PE could safely be excluded. We validated the age-adjusted D-dimer test and assessed its performance in combination with the four CDRs in patients with suspected PE. A total of 414 consecutive patients with suspected PE who were older than 50 years were included. The proportion of patients in whom PE could be excluded with an 'unlikely' clinical probability combined with a normal age-adjusted D-dimer test was calculated and compared with the proportion using the conventional D-dimer cut-off. We assessed venous thromboembolism (VTE) failure rates during three months follow-up. In patients above 50 years, a normal age-adjusted D-dimer level in combination with an 'unlikely' CDR substantially increased the number of patients in whom PE could be safely excluded: from 13-14% to 19-22% in all CDRs similarly. In patients over 70 years, the number of exclusions was nearly four-fold higher, and the original Wells score excluded most patients, with an increase from 6% to 21% combined with the conventional and age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off, respectively. The number of VTE failures was also comparable in all CDRs. In conclusion, irrespective of which CDR is used, the age-adjusted D-dimer substantially increases the number of patients above 50 years in whom PE can be safely excluded."
CD010864,0,16301973,0,[Diagnostic approach to venous thromboembolic disease].,"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has long been based on purely clinical grounds. Pulmonary angiography and scintigraphy, as well as venography, reveal the poor diagnostic value of signs and symptoms of PE and DVT, which are now reduced to the role of triggers for these diagnostic tests. The development of simpler, but still imperfect, diagnostic tools (mainly, D-dimer plasma level, venous compression ultrasound, clinical probability of PE or DVT, spiral CT pulmonary angiography) has led to the development of diagnostic strategies, which use combinations of tests, not to provide diagnostic certainty for every patient (presence or absence of clots), but rather to select populations of patients who need treatment and others who can safely remain untreated. Such pragmatic approaches must be validated in appropriate outcome studies. The choice of a diagnostic strategy should depend not only on the strategy's cost-effectiveness in the population under study but also on the local facilities and expertise required for its use."
CD010864,0,23178976,0,The influence of thrombophilia on the long-term survival of patients with a history of venous thromboembolism.,"Data on the long-term survival following venous thromboembolism (VTE) are rare, and the influence of thrombophilia has not been evaluated thus far. Our aim was to assess thrombophilia-parameters as predictors for long-term survival of patients with VTE. Overall, 1,905 out-patients (99 with antithrombin-, protein C or protein S deficiency, 517 with factor V Leiden, 381 with elevated factor VIII and 160 with elevated homocysteine levels, of these 202 had a combination and 961 had none of these risk factors) were included in the study between September 1, 1994 and December 31, 2007. Retrospective survival analysis showed that a total of 78 patients (4.1%) had died during the analysis period, among those four of definite or possible pulmonary embolism and four of bleeding. In multivariable analysis including age and sex an association with increased mortality was found for hyperhomocysteinemia (hazard ratio 2.0 [1.1.-3.5]) whereas this was not the case for all other investigated parameters. We conclude that the classical hereditary thrombophilia risk factors did not have an impact on the long-term survival of patients with a history of VTE. Thus our study supports the current concept that thrombophilia should not be a determinant for decision on long term anticoagulation. However, hyperhomocysteinaemia, known as a risk factor for recurrent VTE and arterial disease, might impact survival."

CD010864,0,18049952,0,Disease-related quantitation of TGF-beta3 in human aqueous humor.,"TGF-beta3 has been implicated in the pathology of ocular diseases, but its concentration in human aqueous humor has never been assessed. In this study, we established an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for TGF-beta3 and quantitated it in aqueous humor collected from patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PE), primary open angle glaucoma, chronic angle closure glaucoma and cataract (as the control). To develop the TGF-beta3 ELISA, we screened antibodies to identify the best combination, validated the assay for aqueous humor, and optimized the procedure for preparing activated TGF-beta3. As a result, our ELISA was highly selective and reproducible. Using our ELISA, we discovered a significantly elevated concentration of TGF-beta3 in PE eyes. We also developed new TGF-beta1 and -beta2 ELISAs, and were able, for the first time, to quantitate all the TGF-beta isoforms in the aqueous humor from a single eye, to assess their proportional effects on the pathogenesis of ocular diseases."
CD010864,0,21743266,0,[Massive pulmonary thromboembolism after abdominoplasty and liposuction].,"Pulmonary embolism is a rare complication of abdominoplasty and liposuction that may result in a fatal consequence. A 65-year-old obese woman presented with complaints of shortness of breath, palpitation, and hypotension (90/60 mmHg) seven weeks after abdominoplasty and liposuction. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, right axis deviation, and right bundle branch block. The chest X-ray showed atelectatic and focally infiltrated areas, and minimal bilateral pleural effusion. Laboratory findings were normal except for D-dimer level (3500 ng/ml). Echocardiography revealed dilated right heart chambers and a thrombus in the left ventricle. Ejection fraction was normal and pulmonary artery pressure was 50 mmHg. Doppler ultrasound showed no signs of thrombosis. Following the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism, the patient received oxygen therapy and heparin infusion. However, the clinical course did not improve, hemodynamic deterioration continued, and the echocardiographic appearance of the thrombus persisted, so thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator was administered, which also resulted in no response. In the end, pulmonary embolectomy was performed and the thrombus was successfully extracted. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on the seventh postoperative day."

CD010864,0,19217473,0,Diagnostic issues of VTE in pregnancy.,"Venous thromboembolism is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, and accurate diagnostic workup upon suspicion of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in a pregnant woman is of utmost importance. The diagnostic repertoire for venous thromboembolism is, however, less well studied in pregnant women. The clinical assessment is influenced by common symptoms of pregnancy such as leg swelling or shortness of breath. The role of D-Dimer is limited, since - even during uncomplicated pregnancy - D-Dimer levels increase with gestational age. Preliminary data indicate that a normal D-Dimer in a healthy pregnant woman with a low clinical probability may exclude deep vein thrombosis. Compression ultrasonography and ventilation perfusion scanning or helical computed tomography are the imaging techniques of choice in a pregnant woman with suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, respectively. The role of magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy is uncertain and contraindications particularly to contrast media have to be considered."
CD010864,0,11697705,0,Antiphospholipid thrombosis syndromes.,"Antiphospholipid antibodies are strongly associated with thrombosis and are the most common of the acquired blood protein defects causing thrombosis. Although the precise mechanism(s) whereby antiphospholipid antibodies alter hemostasis to induce a hypercoagutable state remain unclear, numerous theories, as previously discussed, have been advanced. The most common thrombotic events associated with anticardiolipin antibodies are deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus (type I syndrome), coronary or peripheral artery thrombosis (type II syndrome), or cerebrovascular/retinal vessel thrombosis (type II syndrome); occasionally, patients present with mixtures of these types (type IV syndrome). Type V patients are those with antiphospholipid antibodies and RMS. It is as yet unclear how many seemingly normal individuals who may never develop manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (type VI) harbor asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibodies. The relative frequency of anticardiolipin antibodies in association with arterial and venous thrombosis strongly suggests that these should be looked for in any individual with unexplained thrombosis; all three idiotypes (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be assessed. Also, the type of syndrome (I through VI) should be defined if possible, as this may dictate both type and duration of both immediate and long-term anticoagulant therapy. Unlike those with anticardiolipin antibodies, patients with primary lupus anticoagulant thrombosis syndrome usually experience venous thrombosis. Because the aPTT is unreliable inpatients with lupus anticoagulant (prolonged in only about 40 to 50% of patients) and is not usually prolonged in patients with anticardiolipin antibodies, definitive tests, including ELISA for anticardiolipin antibodies, the dRVVT for lupus anticoagulant, hexagonal phospholipid neutralization procedure, and beta-2-GP-I (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be immediately ordered when suspecting antiphospholipid syndrome or in individuals with otherwise unexplained thrombotic or thromboembolic events. If results of these tests are negative, in the appropriate clinical setting, subgroups should also be assessed. Finally, most patients with antiphospholipid thrombosis syndrome will fail warfarin therapy and, except for retinal vascular thrombosis, may fail some types of antiplatelet therapy; thus it is of major importance to make this diagnosis so that patients can be treated with the most effective therapy for secondary prevention--LMWH or UH in most instances, and clopidogrel in some instances."

CD010864,0,22978741,0,The mortality benefit threshold for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"The mortality benefit for pulmonary embolism (PE) is the difference in mortality between treated and untreated patients. The mortality benefit threshold is the mortality benefit above which testing for a condition should be initiated and below which it should not. To illustrate this concept, the authors developed a decision model to estimate the mortality benefit threshold at several pretest probabilities for low-risk emergency department (ED) patients with possible PE and compare those thresholds with contemporary management of PE in the United States and what is known and not known about treatment benefits with anticoagulation."

Risk factors associated with the development of PE, however, are known to be different between developed and developing countries.

CD010864,0,21742240,0,[Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism].,"Nowadays the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is based on a ""diagnostic strategy"" rather than a single test. The first step, after identifying patients with suspicion of PE, is to establish the pre-test clinical probability. Several scores are available to make a standardised and reproducible assessment of the clinical probability and these, therefore, represent valuable diagnostic tools. Indeed, it is the clinical probability that guides further investigation. In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, PE can be safely ruled out by a negative D-dimer in approximately one-third of patients without additional imaging. In the case of a positive D-dimer or high clinical probability, CT pulmonary angiography is now the recommended imaging technique. However, lower limb venous compression ultrasound and ventilation/perfusion scans remain useful in patients with contraindications to CT; mainly those with renal insufficiency. In the presence of readily available and strongly validated diagnostic strategies, the challenge for the future will probably be better identification of patients in whom PE should be suspected."
CD010864,0,14695156,0,Antitumor therapy with bacterial DNA and toxin: complete regression of established tumor induced by liposomal CpG oligodeoxynucleotides plus interleukin-13 cytotoxin.,"Despite urgent need, no single strategy has been widely effective at controlling the growth of rapidly progressive solid tumors. We demonstrate here a potent antitumor therapy using modified bacterial DNA and toxin. Treatment of human head and neck cancer established as xenografts in athymic mice with immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides encapsulated in sterically stabilized cationic liposome [(CpG ODN)(SSCL)] and recombinant interleukin-13 Pseudomonas exotoxin (IL13-PE) significantly reduced the tumor growth followed by complete regression in most animals. The antitumor activity of (CpG ODN)(SSCL) was dependent on natural killer cells that infiltrated within tumors. Interestingly, IL13-PE enhanced (CpG ODN)(SSCL)-induced natural killer cell activity and cytokine production in vivo and in vitro. These data strongly suggest that a combination of innate immune activation by (CpG ODN)(SSCL) and tumor-directed targeting by IL13-PE is a novel approach for human cancer immunotherapy."

CD010864,0,20045145,0,Preliminary report: circulating levels of the adipokine vaspin in gestational diabetes mellitus and preeclampsia.,"The objective of the study was to investigate serum levels of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine vaspin in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and preeclampsia (PE) as compared with healthy controls of similar gestational age. Vaspin serum levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in control (n = 102), GDM (n = 40), and PE (n = 22) subjects. Median maternal vaspin concentrations were not significantly different in GDM, PE, and control subjects. Furthermore, vaspin did not significantly correlate to clinical and biochemical measures of renal function, glucose, and lipid metabolism, as well as inflammation. Circulating vaspin levels are not significantly different between GDM, PE, and control subjects and do not correlate with insulin sensitivity in pregnant subjects."
CD010864,0,20213258,0,"Biochemical markers for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism: the past, present and future.","Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism represent two expressions of a similar clinical pathological process traditionally referred to as venous thromboembolism. Several population studies evidence venous thromboembolism as a leading healthcare problem worldwide, highlighting the need for early and reliable diagnosis to enable appropriate triage of affected patients and to optimize outcome. There is still debate, however, on which thrombotic markers to use, as well as their most suitable position within diagnostic algorithms. This article aims to review the pathophysiology and clinical usefulness of past, present and future markers of thrombosis, including soluble fibrin monomers, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, thrombin-antithrombin complex, plasmin-antiplasmin complex, fibrinopeptide A and B, prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, thrombus precursor protein, D-dimer, activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex, myeloperoxidase, thrombin generation assays and proteomic analysis. Several lines of evidence now attest that the global diagnostic performances of some D-dimer assays largely outperform those of any other coagulation or fibrinolytic marker proposed thus far, and a ""negative"" D-dimer measured with rapid enzyme linked fluorescent immunoassay is now considered the biochemical gold standard for ruling out an acute episode of venous thromboembolism in a patient with a low pretest probability for venous thromboembolism, so that additional testing can be safely omitted. However, to further improve clinical outcomes, the diagnostic efficiency of combining D-dimer testing with other markers covering different pathophysiological aspects of thrombosis such as continuous and progressive thrombin generation (e.g., activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex) or neutrophil activation (i.e., myeloperoxidase) merits further investigation. Proteomic analysis, which would help to characterize the structure and function of each protein and the complexities of protein-protein interactions in physiological and pathological hemostasis, also holds promise for identifying novel markers and developing effective diagnostic protocols in the future."
CD010864,0,10974142,0,Quantitative and bioluminescent assay to measure efficacy of conventional and DNA vaccinations against Helicobacter pylori.,"Vaccination against Helicobacter pylori using DNA sequences encoding Urease A and B subunits was compared to immunization with urease antigen and MTP-PE in a liposome formulation. To determine the effectiveness of a vaccine against H. pylori in a mouse model it is essential to quantify the number of H. pylori remaining in the stomachs following challenge with an inoculum of live bacteria. Culture assays and enzymatic assays produce inconsistent results often unsuitable to conclude if vaccine candidates are protective. To overcome this problem, we developed two assays: 1) a competitive quantitative PCR using a colorimetric readout and 2) a non-competitive direct quantitative PCR using a highly sensitive bioluminescent readout. The competitive PCR requires coamplification of a segment of the urease C sequence and an internal control standard in a competitive manner using a single set of primers. PCR products were quantified colorimetrically by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared with known quantities of the internal control standard added to the PCR reaction. The highly sensitive, bioluminescent assay measures the amplified DNA directly using a flash-type luminescent tag and a specific probe. The Sydney strain of H. pylori was used for the mouse infection model. Quantification of H. pylori by either the bioluminescent assay or the competitive PCR was reliable, specific and sensitive compared to quantitative growth assays which often gave false results. The bioluminescent assay was much more sensitive and less labor/time intensive than the competitive PCR. The bioluminescent assay was able to quantitate as few as 100 bacteria, while the competitive assay could not detect less than 10(3) bacteria per mouse stomach. Quantification of H. pylori by bioluminescent assay was superior to the competitive assay and may be used for research applications, such as the development of vaccines, pathogenesis of gastric disease and monitoring of antibiotic treatment."

CD010864,0,6206097,0,Measurement of cross linked fibrin derivatives in plasma: an immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies.,"Fibrinogen degradation, fibrin polymerisation, and the insertion of cross links into fibrin by fibrin stabilising factor lead to the appearance of new antigenic determinants. Antibodies against these antigenic sites may react specifically with the derivatives but not with the parent molecules. We have utilised a monoclonal antibody, which interacts with the cross linked fragment D dimer and related high molecular weight fibrin derivatives, to develop an enzyme immunoassay which measures cross linked fibrin derivatives in plasma and serum using D dimer as standard. Mean concentration in plasma from normal subjects was 75 ng/ml with an upper limit of about 144 ng/ml. Concentrations in patients with pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thromboembolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were raised in all cases. Confirmation of the specific increase of cross linked fibrin derivatives in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation was obtained by parallel monitoring of their fibrin degradation products in serum using affinity chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In many patients the plasma concentrations greatly exceeded the serum values of cross linked fibrin degradation products, suggesting that the procedure can measure fibrin derivatives in plasma which are absent from serum."
CD010864,0,11594024,0,Tests for the toxicity assessment of cyanobacterial bloom samples.,"Cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) blooms are one of the common consequences of the increasing eutrophication of surface waters. The production of cyanobacterial toxins and their presence in drinking and recreational waters represents a growing danger to human and animal health. Due to a lack of toxin standards and to resource limitations on the wide-scale use of analytical methods (e.g., high-performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) in cyanobacterial toxin monitoring, it is necessary to assess and to develop additional methods for their detection and estimation. Microbiotests using invertebrates offer a possible approach for the inexpensive and straightforward detection and assessment of cyanobacterial bloom toxicity. Three microbiotests with: Thamnocephalus platyurus, Daphnia magna, and Spirostomum ambiguum were examined with bloom samples containing hepatotoxic microcystin-LR and up to five additional microcystin variants. Two kinds of cyanobacterial bloom sample preparations were tested: crude extracts (CE) and purified extracts (PE). The highest toxicity was found when CE was used for microbiotests. The sensitivity of microorganisms decreased from S. ambiguum to T. platyurus and to D. magna. A statistically significant correlation was found between microcystin concentration and T. platyurus biotest, and between mouse bioassay and S. ambiguum results. Addition of Me2SO (1%, v/v) is a possible method to increase the sensitivity of the microorganisms for microcystin-LR."

Eighty-one patients with neuroepithelial tumor were prospectively studied. All patients underwent measurement of serum D-dimer levels and Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremity. The serum D-dimer level was measured every week, and Doppler ultrasonography was performed two and two weeks after surgery, then every two weeks until discharge, or every two weeks for patients who did not undergo surgery. If the serum D-dimer level increased over 10.0 Î¼g/ml, Doppler ultrasonography or computed tomography was performed to detect VTE. VTE occurred in 12 (14.8%) patients (seven males and five females; age 34-75, mean 59.0 years). Only one patient was symptomatic, whereas 11 patients identified by the screening were without symptoms. Five patients were treated with anticoagulant therapy, one with prophylactic inferior vena cava filter placement with anticoagulant therapy, and the other six were closely followed up without medication. No patient died of pulmonary embolism. Serial Doppler ultrasonography showed thrombus regression or organization and no thrombus extension. The maximum serum D-dimer value was significantly higher in patients with VTE than in those without VTE (mean 14.5 vs. 3.46 Î¼g/ml, P < 0.001). The D-dimer cutoff value of 5.4 Î¼g/ml could be used to identify VTE with 83% sensitivity and 84% specificity. The combination of sequential serum D-dimer measurement and Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremity is an efficient and non-invasive procedure for identifying asymptomatic VTE in patients with neuroepithelial tumor."

After 130 days of infection the metabolite ratio of inorganic phosphate (Pi)/beta ATP significantly increased whereas that of phosphocreatine (PCr)/beta ATP significantly decreased. In older, 265 day infections, the increase in Pi/beta ATP and decrease in PCr/beta ATP persisted. Changes in the group infected for 130 days were accompanied by lowered pH. Analysis of liver extracts from mice with 130-day-old. H. microstoma revealed significantly lower concentrations of Pi, ATP and ADP compounds. In those from mice infected for 265 days the concentration of Pi remained low whereas concentrations of ATP and ADP increased to levels in between those of controls and the 130-day-old infection. In addition, levels of phosphorylethanolamine (PE) and of an unknown metabolite significantly increased in this latter group. Worm extracts contained high levels of glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), Pi, fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP), PE, diphosphodiesters (DPDE), phosphorylcholine (PC) and glycerolphosphorylethanolamine (GPE) in order of declining concentrations, respectively."

We studied a cohort of 361 unselected patients with various autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD), 69 patients with thromboembolic phenomena (TEP) unassociated with ARD, and 267 healthy blood donors (HBD). Anti-CL of at least one immunoglobulin class were found in 42 (11.6%) of the ARD patients, in 3 (4.3%) of the TEP patients (2 with myocardial infarction and 1 with pulmonary emboli), and in 6 (2.3%) of the HBD. In ARD patients anti-CL were more prevalent in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and overlap syndromes. Significant correlations included CNS involvement (particularly seizures) and features of immune hyperreactivity (splenomegaly-lymphadenopathy, ANA, and antibodies to Ro(SSA), U1-nRNP, and double-stranded DNA). No statistical correlation could be demonstrated between the presence of anti-CL and thrombotic events, hematologic disorders, or recurrent abortions in the ARD patients."
CD010864,0,11943938,0,Decrease in sensitivity of D-dimer for acute venous thromboembolism after starting anticoagulant therapy.,"D-dimer testing is useful for the exclusion of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE). Anticoagulant therapy is expected to reduce D-dimer levels in patients with thrombosis and, consequently, it may not be safe to use D-dimer levels to exclude VTE after anticoagulant therapy has been started. The objectives of this study were to estimate the decrease in D-dimer levels after 24 h of heparin therapy and, applying this estimate to the results of a recent study, to calculate the expected reduction in sensitivity. Using pre-defined criteria, we first performed a literature review to determine whether, and by how much, D-dimer levels decrease within 24 h of starting heparin therapy in patients with acute VTE. Using D-dimer levels that were measured in a prospective study of patients with confirmed deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism as baselines, we then determined the change in sensitivity (and specificity) that would result from the fall in D-dimer levels that the literature review suggested would have occurred after 24 h of heparin therapy. On the basis of the literature review, we calculated that mean D-dimer levels decrease by 25%, 24 h after starting heparin therapy in patients with acute VTE. This 25% decrease in D-dimer levels resulted in a decrease in sensitivity from 95.6% (95% confidence interval, 90.0-98.6) to 89.4% (95% confidence interval, 83.7-95.1). There is a decrease in D-dimer levels in patients with acute VTE 24 h after starting heparin therapy that is expected to result in a clinically important drop in sensitivity."

CD010864,0,21036031,0,Imaging evaluation of the pregnant patient with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism is the leading cause of maternal death in the developed world. The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is particularly challenging in pregnant patients as physiologic changes of pregnancy can mimic symptoms of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis. Clinical decision and imaging algorithms for venous thromboembolic disease have been proposed in the literature for the general population, but have not undergone wide-scale validation in pregnant patients. Laboratory evaluation of D-dimer levels has likewise been established as a viable screening method in the general population but remains controversial in pregnant patients. Regardless of whether D-dimer levels are used in this population, the clinician must often rely on imaging tests to confirm or exclude a clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism. Additional factors beyond test performance must be weighed during pregnancy: radiation exposure to the fetus and maternal breast tissue, the safety of intravenous contrast administration and the diagnostic accuracy of the various testing options so that diagnosis and proper management are not delayed. The epidemiology of pregnancy-related venous thromboembolic disease and the different diagnostic methods are reviewed, with emphasis on the pregnant patient. Finally, a diagnostic imaging algorithm is proposed for the evaluation of the pregnant patient when a clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism exists."

CD010864,0,20637753,0,In vivo adsorption of autoantibodies in myasthenia gravis using Nanodisc-incorporated acetylcholine receptor.,"Autoantibodies directed against the skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of the autoimmune disease, myasthenia gravis (MG). The pathogenic importance of anti-AChR antibodies is substantiated clinically by the often dramatic clinical improvement that follows removal of circulating antibodies utilizing extracorporeal plasma exchange (PE). Unfortunately, the effects of PE are non-specific as immunoglobulins (IgG) and other plasma proteins are removed in addition to anti-AChR IgG. In this study, we have successfully incorporated the AChR protein purified from Torpedo californicus into a Nanodisc (ND) membrane scaffold protein/phospholipid structure. We go on to demonstrate the effectiveness of this ND-AChR complex, administered intravenously, in the in vivo down-modulation of anti-AChR antibodies and subsequent amelioration of clinical disease in the experimental murine model of MG. These results provide proof-of-principle for the in vivo antigen-specific reduction of pathogenic anti-AChR antibodies utilizing ND-AChR particles. Further development of this strategy may provide an effective, antigen-specific, and readily accessible acute therapy for exacerbating MG or myasthenic crisis."

CD010864,0,19056122,0,Expression patterns of two serine protease HtrA1 forms in human placentas complicated by preeclampsia with and without intrauterine growth restriction.,"Preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are pregnancy-specific disorders that have in common abnormal placental implantation, a marked proliferation of villous cytotrophoblastic cells and focal necrosis of the syncytiotrophoblast. Several studies show an ischemic placenta with a high-resistance vasculature, which cannot deliver an adequate blood supply to the feto-placental unit. The cause of PE is a matter of debate, but recently studies in mice suggest that the primary feto-placental lesions are sufficient to initiate the disease. HtrA1, a member of the family of HtrA proteins, is a secreted multidomain protein with serine protease activity. It is expressed in first and third trimester of gestation. In specimens from the first trimester of gestation, immunostaining for HtrA1 is generally found in both layers of villous trophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast. Cytoplasm of extravillous trophoblast and extracellular matrix of cell islands and cell columns are labeled for HtrA1. Specimens from third trimester of gestation show a more intense positivity for HtrA1 in the syncytiotrophoblast than in cytotrophoblast. The extravillous trophoblast and the decidual cells, is positive for HtrA1. The purpose of this study is to investigate the expression pattern of HtrA1 in placentas from PE without IUGR (maternal PE) and with IUGR (fetal PE) by quantitative western blotting and immunohistochemistry. By quantitative western blotting analysis we observed a significant upregulation of approximately 30 kDa HtrA1 form in PE. Differently, we detected a significant total HtrA1 down-regulation in PE-IUGR. Moreover, immunostaining for HtrA1 was positive in the villous trophoblast, in the syncytial knots and irregularly in the fetal vessel walls in PE placentas while immunostaining for HtrA1was present particularly in the syncytial knots in PE-IUGR placentas. In conclusion, we suggest that the approximately 30 kDa HtrA1 form can be correlated to maternal PE while that the significant down-regulation of total HtrA1 can be correlated to placental PE. These HtrA1 alterations could be considered as possible markers to discriminate placental PE from maternal PE."

Forty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into control and atorvastatin groups. Acute PE was created by injection of autologous blood clots into the femoral vein. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure TNF-Î± and IL-1Î². At baseline, there was no significant difference in serum TNF-Î± (10.6 Â± 1.3 versus 11.2 Â± 1.9 pg/mL; P > .05) or IL-1Î² (8.2 Â± 1.0 versus 8.6 Â± 0.9 pg/mL; P > .05) between the control group and the atorvastatin group. In both groups, there was a significant increase in the serum TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² following acute PE. However, the levels of serum TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² in the atorvastatin group was significantly lower than in the control group following PE (P < .01). The authors conclude that acute PE is associated with a significant increase in serum proinflammatory factors TNF-Î± and IL-1Î². Pretreatment with atorvastatin diminished the increase in TNF-Î± and IL-1Î²."

CD010864,0,22197626,0,Review: Biochemical markers to predict preeclampsia.,"Worldwide the prevalence of preeclampsia (PE) ranges from 3 to 8% of pregnancies. 8.5 million cases are reported yearly, but this is probably an underestimate due to the lack of proper diagnosis. PE is the most common cause of fetal and maternal death and yet no specific treatment is available. Reliable biochemical markers for prediction and diagnosis of PE would have a great impact on maternal health and several have been suggested. This review describes PE biochemical markers in general and first trimester PE biochemical markers specifically. The main categories described are angiogenic/anti-angiogenic factors, placental proteins, free fetal hemoglobin (HbF), kidney markers, ultrasound and maternal risk factors. The specific biochemical markers discussed are: PAPP-A, s-Flt-1/PlGF, s-Endoglin, PP13, cystatin-C, HbF, and Î±â-microglobulin (A1M). PAPP-A and HbF both show potential as predictive biochemical markers in the first trimester with 70% sensitivity at 95% specificity. However, PAPP-A is not PE-specific and needs to be combined with Doppler ultrasound to obtain the same sensitivity as HbF/A1M. Soluble Flt -1 and PlGF are promising biochemical markers that together show high sensitivity from the mid-second trimester. PlGF is somewhat useful from the end of the first trimester. Screening pregnant women with biochemical markers for PE can reduce unnecessary suffering and health care costs by early detection of mothers at increased risk for PE, thus avoiding unnecessary hospitalization of pregnant women with suspect or mild PE and enabling monitoring of the progression of the disease thereby optimizing time for delivery and hopefully reducing the number of premature births."
CD010864,0,21824644,0,Elevated soluble endothelial cell protein C receptor (sEPCR) levels in women with preeclampsia: a marker of endothelial activation/damage?,"The endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) plays a crucial role in the anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory effects of the protein C pathway, whereas its soluble form (sEPCR) exhibits opposite properties. High plasma levels of sEPCR have been observed in subjects carrying the A3 haplotype of PROCR, the EPCR gene. Elevated plasma levels of sEPCR were also recently reported in women with preeclampsia (PE), a multisystemic syndrome involving inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. To determine whether this increase is genetically mediated or acquired, we analyzed sEPCR levels and the A3 haplotype distribution in 145 preeclamptic women and 145 age- and term-matched women with normal pregnancies enrolled in a case-control study. Plasma sEPCR levels were higher in the women with PE than in the controls, and this difference was not due to A3 haplotype over-representation. We observed a positive correlation between sEPCR levels and two markers of endothelium activation/damage (von Willebrand factor and soluble thrombomodulin), and a trend towards a third (sVCAM1). We also found an association between sEPCR levels in the highest quartile and the PE risk. The modest increase of sEPCR levels, together with the correlation with other endothelium activation/damage markers, suggest that it is more an innocent bystander of the endothelium activation/damage than an actor in PE."

The 3 children initially presented with acute vomiting, fatigue, gross hematuria, hypertension, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, nephrotic syndrome, and acute kidney injury. C3 levels were normal in patients 1 and 3 and low in patient 2 (0.376 mg/mL [0.376 g/L]). CFH antibody titers were increased (15,000 to > 32,000 arbitrary units [AU]). Patient 1, an 11-year-old boy, was treated with 12 PEs, leading to a decrease in CFH antibody titer (to 800 AU). A first relapse 1 month later was treated with 6 PEs and 4 rituximab infusions. A second relapse 3 months later required 5 PEs, and the patient received oral steroids (0.5 mg/d/kg body weight) and 5 cyclophosphamide pulses (1 g/1.73 m(2)), leading to sustained remission with normal kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], 120 mL/min/1.73 m(2) [2.0 mL/s/1.73 m(2)]) and a stable decrease in CFH antibody titer (to 2,000 AU) 3 years later. Patient 2, a 5-year-old boy, required dialysis therapy for 2 weeks. He received 3 plasma infusions without remission. Six PEs associated with 2 cyclophosphamide pulses (0.5 g/1.73 m(2)) and steroids (1 mg/d/kg body weight) led to rapid remission, with eGFR of 107 mL/min/1.73 m(2) [1.78 mL/s/1.73 m(2)] and a prolonged decrease in CFH antibody titer after 15 months (1,300 AU). Patient 3, a 16-month-old boy, was treated with oral steroids (1 mg/d/kg body weight), 2 PEs, and 2 cyclophosphamide pulses (0.5 g/1.73 m(2)), resulting in a stable decrease in CFH antibody titer to 276 AU. Kidney function quickly normalized (eGFR, 110 mL/min/1.73 m(2) [1.83 mL/s/1.73 m(2)]) and has remained normal after 14 months. All 3 patients show a homozygous deletion mutation of the CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes. Cyclophosphamide pulses with PE may lead to a prolonged decrease in CFH antibody titers and a favorable outcome of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and kidney function."

CD010864,0,19308893,0,The role of D-dimer testing in patients with suspected venous thromboembolism.,"D-dimer, the final degradation product of cross-linked fibrin, is typically elevated in patients with acute venous thromboembolism. With its high sensitivity and negative predictive value, D-dimer testing may have a role for ruling-out the diagnosis in patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. For this purpose, D-dimer testing has been integrated in sequential diagnostic strategies including those using pretest clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques. A large variety of assays are now available for D-dimer measurement, with different sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. Attempts to standardize the various D-dimer assays have been made but without any definitive answers as yet. The diagnostic yield of D-dimer testing is affected not only by the choice of the appropriate assay but also by patient characteristics. As a consequence, the clinical usefulness of D-dimer testing for the exclusion of suspected venous thromboembolism should be carefully evaluated in special clinical settings."

Further investigations can then be guided by the use of a clinical probability score. The revised Geneva score and the Wells score are the most validated tools. They are reliable in stratifying patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories. When clinical probability is low or intermediate, the dosage of d-dimers is helpful.

Six hundred twenty-eight patients (331 males; median age: 67 years) were followed after OA interruption (mean follow-up = 22 months). Three to four weeks from OA discontinuation patients were given a complete thrombophilic work-out, including aPTT (automated aPTT). Recurrent symptomatic VTE events (objectively documented) occurred in 71/628 (11.3%, 6.8/100 person-years) patients. The VTE recurrence rate was 17.5% and 7.5% in patients with aPTT in the lower (ratio < or =0.90) and in the upper (ratio >1.05) quartiles. The recurrence risk was more than twofold higher in patients with ratio < or =0.90 versus those of the reference category [Relative risk (RR): 2.38 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-4.78)]. As expected, the increase in recurrence risk disappeared after adjustment for factor VIII, IX and XI levels [RR: 1.74 (95%CI: 0.43-2.76)]. In contrast, the risk was persistently increased in patients with a ratio < or =0.90 [RR: 2.07 (95%CI: 1.02-4.18)] after adjustment for age, gender and d-dimer level. The aPTT predictive value was independent of the presence of inherited thrombophilic alterations.

CD010864,0,18287402,0,Preeclamptic sera induce nephrin shedding from podocytes through endothelin-1 release by endothelial glomerular cells.,"In preeclampsia (PE), proteinuria has been associated with a reduced expression of nephrin by podocytes. In the present study, we investigated in vitro on human cultured podocytes the mechanism responsible for nephrin loss in PE. Sera from patients with PE did not directly downregulate the expression of nephrin. In contrast, conditioned medium obtained from glomerular endothelial cells incubated with PE sera induced loss of nephrin and synaptopodin, but not of podocin, from podocytes. Nephrin loss was related to a rapid shedding of the protein from the cell surface due to cleavage of its extracellular domain by proteases and to cytoskeleton redistribution. The absence of nephrin mRNA downregulation together with nephrin reexpression within 24 h confirm that the loss of nephrin was not related to a reduced synthesis. Studies with an endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor antagonist that abrogated the loss of nephrin triggered by glomerular endothelial conditioned medium of PE sera indicated that ET-1 was the main effector of nephrin loss. Indeed, ET-1 was synthesized and released from glomerular endothelial cells when incubated with PE sera, and recombinant ET-1 triggered nephrin shedding from podocytes. Moreover, VEGF blockade induced ET-1 release from endothelial cells, and in turn the conditioned medium obtained triggered nephrin loss. In conclusion, the present study identifies a potential mechanism of nephrin loss in PE that may link endothelial injury with enhanced glomerular permeability."

Three different protocols were defined to identify the normal subsets of B, T and myeloid cells in bone marrow (BM), and were applied to the different types of AL in order to study aberrant immunophenotypes. Using sensitive acquisition methods ('live gate') T cell subsets in normal BM could be identified with five triple-stains: CD7/CD5/CD3, CD7/CD4/CD8, CD7/CD2/CD3, CD7/CD38/CD34 and TdT/CD7/surface or cytoplasmic (cy)CD3 (antibodies conjugated with FITC/PE/PECy5 or PerCP, respectively). The identification of T cell subsets in BM allowed definition of 'empty spaces' (ie areas of flow cytometric plots where normally no cells are found). All studied T-ALL cases (n = 65) were located in 'empty spaces' and could be discriminated from normal T cells. The most informative triple staining was TdT/CD7/cyCD3, which was aberrant in 91% of T-ALL cases. In most cases, two or more aberrant patterns were found. Apparently the immunophenotypes of T-ALL differ significantly from normal BM T cells. This is mostly caused by their thymocytic origin, but also the neoplastic transformation might have affected antigen expression patterns. Application of the five proposed marker combinations in T-ALL contributes to standardized detection of MRD, since cells persistent or reappearing in the 'empty spaces' can be easily identified in follow-up BM samples during and after treatment."

CD010864,0,8325118,0,Acute rise in serum immunoglobulin E concentration in pulmonary thromboembolism.,"Events mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) may be related to platelet activation and aggregation, and there may be an association between IgE and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). Fourteen patients with PTE were studied with regard to serum concentrations of IgE, IgA, IgG, IgM, fibrinogen, and D-dimer and with regard to blood neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, and eosinophil counts during acute and recovery phases. The serum IgE concentration increased during the acute phase to 402 +/- 310 IU/ml and decreased afterwards in all patients. The increase in serum IgE concentration lagged a few days behind that of the serum D-dimer concentration, indicating later IgE production than thrombus formation and lysis. Infarction and pleural fluid accumulation developed in patients with a high initial serum IgE concentration. These results indicated a relationship between serum IgE concentration and the pathophysiology of PTE. Serum IgE may be an indicator of the severity of PTE and provide insight into its pathogenesis, thereby facilitating the diagnosis of PTE."

CD010864,0,19690336,0,Altered fibrin clot structure/function in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism and in their relatives.,"We tested the hypothesis that fibrin structure/function is unfavorably altered in patients after idiopathic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and their relatives. Ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability, turbidimetry, and efficiency of fibrinolysis were investigated in 100 patients with first-ever VTE, including 34 with pulmonary embolism (PE), 100 first-degree relatives, and 100 asymptomatic controls with no history of thrombotic events. Known thrombophilia, cancer, trauma, and surgery were exclusion criteria. VTE patients and their relatives were characterized by lower clot permeability (P < .001), lower compaction (P < .001), higher maximum clot absorbancy (P < .001), and prolonged clot lysis time (P < .001) than controls, with more pronounced abnormalities, except maximum clot absorbance, in the patients versus relatives (all P < .01). Fibrin clots obtained for PE patients were more permeable, less compact, and were lysed more efficiently compared with deep-vein thrombosis patients (all P < .05) with no differences in their relatives. Being VTE relative, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of clot permeability and fibrinolysis time in combined analysis of controls and relatives. We conclude that altered fibrin clot features are associated with idiopathic VTE with a different profile of fibrin variables in PE. Similar features can be detected in VTE relatives. Fibrin properties might represent novel risk factors for thrombosis."

CD010864,0,23145134,0,Mid-gestational gene expression profile in placenta and link to pregnancy complications.,"Despite the importance of placenta in mediating rapid physiological changes in pregnancy, data on temporal dynamics of placental gene expression are limited. We completed the first transcriptome profiling of human placental gene expression dynamics (GeneChips, AffymetrixÂ®; ~47,000 transcripts) from early to mid-gestation (n = 10; gestational weeks 5-18) and report 154 genes with significant transcriptional changes (ANOVA, FDR P<0.1). TaqMan RT-qPCR analysis (n = 43; gestational weeks 5-41) confirmed a significant (ANOVA and t-test, FDR P<0.05) mid-gestational peak of placental gene expression for BMP5, CCNG2, CDH11, FST, GATM, GPR183, ITGBL1, PLAGL1, SLC16A10 and STC1, followed by sharp decrease in mRNA levels at term (t-test, FDR P<0.05). We hypothesized that normal course of late pregnancy may be affected when genes characteristic to mid-gestation placenta remain highly expressed until term, and analyzed their expression in term placentas from normal and complicated pregnancies [preeclampsia (PE), n = 12; gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), n = 12; small- and large-for-gestational-age newborns (SGA, LGA), n = 12+12]. STC1 (stanniocalcin 1) exhibited increased mRNA levels in all studied complications, with the most significant effect in PE- and SGA-groups (t-test, FDR P<0.05). In post-partum maternal plasma, the highest STC1 hormone levels (ELISA, n = 129) were found in women who had developed PE and delivered a SGA newborn (median 731 vs 418 pg/ml in controls; ANCOVA, P = 0.00048). Significantly higher expression (t-test, FDR P<0.05) of CCNG2 and LYPD6 accompanied with enhanced immunostaining of the protein was detected in placental sections of PE and GDM cases (n = 15). Our study demonstrates the importance of temporal dynamics of placental transcriptional regulation across three trimesters of gestation. Interestingly, many genes with high expression in mid-gestation placenta have also been implicated in adult complex disease, promoting the discussion on the role of placenta in developmental programming. The discovery of elevated maternal plasma STC1 in pregnancy complications warrants further investigations of its potential as a biomarker."

CD010864,0,17060659,0,Diagnosis and treatment of deep-vein thrombosis.,"Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common condition that can lead to complications such as postphlebitic syndrome, pulmonary embolism and death. The approach to the diagnosis of DVT has evolved over the years. Currently an algorithm strategy combining pretest probability, D-dimer testing and compression ultrasound imaging allows for safe and convenient investigation of suspected lower-extremity thrombosis. Patients with low pretest probability and a negative D-dimer test result can have proximal DVT excluded without the need for diagnostic imaging. The mainstay of treatment of DVT is anticoagulation therapy, whereas interventions such as thrombolysis and placement of inferior vena cava filters are reserved for special situations. The use of low-molecular-weight heparin allows for outpatient management of most patients with DVT. The duration of anticoagulation therapy depends on whether the primary event was idiopathic or secondary to a transient risk factor. More research is required to optimally define the factors that predict an increased risk of recurrent DVT to determine which patients can benefit from extended anticoagulant therapy."
CD010864,0,8986162,0,What the neurosurgeon needs to know about the coagulation system.,"Intracranial surgery is often complicated by thromboembolic events including the life-threatening pulmonary embolism. After head trauma and in patients with brain tumors disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can occur, characterized by the triggering of the coagulation cascade and the depletion of coagulation factors which ultimately leads to bleeding. The identification of patients at high risk as well as the early diagnosis of hemostatic problems uses routine laboratory parameters such as partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time reflecting the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation respectively. Thrombin antithrombin III complexes (TAT) and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) are further indicators of an activation of the coagulation whereas fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) refer to the fibrinolytic system. The basic principles of coagulation and fibrinolysis are summarized as well as the changes of laboratory parameters accompanying DIC, hypercoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis."
CD010864,0,16113805,1,Diagnostic strategy using a modified clinical decision rule and D-dimer test to rule out pulmonary embolism in elderly in- and outpatients.,"Excluding or confirming pulmonary embolism remains a diagnostic challenge. In elderly patients pulmonary embolism is associated with substantial co-morbidity and mortality, and many elderly patients with suspected pulmonary embolism are inpatients. The safety and efficacy of the combination of a clinical probability (CDR) and d-dimer test in excluding pulmonary embolism in this group is unclear. We retrospectively analysed data of two prospective studies of consecutive in-and outpatients with suspected pulmonary embolism. The patients were categorized into three age groups: <65 years, 65-75 years and >75 years. The sensitivity, negative predictive value and the proportion of patients with the combination of a non-high CDR score according to Wells (< or = 4) and a normal d-dimer result were calculated for each group. In 747 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, sensitivity and negative predictive value of a non-high CDR and a normal d-dimer result in outpatients (n=538) of all age categories (<65 years, 65-75 years and >75 years) were both 100%. These tests were, however, less reliable for inpatients(n=209), irrespective of their age (sensitivity 91% [ CI: 79-98%], negative predictive value 88 % [CI: 74-96%]. The proportion of both in-and outpatients >75 years with a non-high CDR and a normal d-dimer concentration was only 14%, whereas this was 22% in patients 65-75 years and 41% among in-and outpatients <65 years, respectively. In elderly outpatients the combination of a non-high CDR and a normal d-dimer result is a safe strategy to rule out pulmonary embolism. However, in inpatients this algorithm is not reliable to safely exclude pulmonary embolism. In addition, the proportion of patients >65 years in which this strategy excludes pulmonary embolism is markedly lower compared to younger patients."

Chromatography of serum samples from patients including those with pulmonary emboli and deep venous thrombosis indicates that the majority of non-clottable fibrin(ogen)-related antigen present is of high molecular weight--greater than that of fibrinogen--and that in pathological situations there is a quantitative increase not a qualitative alteration in the molecular species present."

We used complement dependent liposome lysis assay for screening MAbs and antibodies that bind to PI(4,5)P2 but not to phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate [PI(4)P] were selected. The reactivity of the MAbs was analyzed by complement dependent liposome lysis assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and inhibition of liposome lysis by soluble haptens. The MAbs exhibited three distinct reactivity profiles measured by three different assay systems and the results obtained from three typical MAbs designated AM-2, AM-7 and AM-212 are described. On liposome lysis assay, all three MAbs were highly specific with PI(4,5)P2 and no cross-reaction with other acidic phospholipids such as PI(4)P, phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and cardiolipin (CL) was observed. All three MAbs were able to react with as low as 0.1 mol% of PI(4,5)P2 embedded in the liposomal membrane. On ELISA, AM-2 and AM-212 bound only to PI(4,5)P2 and did not cross-react with other acidic phospholipids including PI(4)P. In contrast, AM-7 showed considerable binding to other phospholipids such as PI(4)P, PA and PE on ELISA. The reactivities of the MAbs with water soluble haptens such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] were examined by inhibition of liposome lysis. Among three clones examined, only AM-212 showed considerable reactivity with Ins(1,4,5)P3 while also showing weak cross-reactivity with fructose 1,6-diphosphate and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate. No cross-reaction with other structural analogs such as inositol 1-monophosphate and inositol 2-monophosphate was observed."

CD010864,0,17602346,0,[Comparison of clinical assessments with computerized tomography pulmonary angiography results in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism].,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is difficult to diagnose. We investigated the relationship between computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) with clinical assessments and thrombus localization. 56 patients with the suspicion of PE; 27 male, 29 female were included. They were evaluated by empirical and Wells clinical assessments, tested with D-Dimer. According to the combination of both CTPA was performed where necessary (if one of the clinical assessments was high or intermediate or those with low clinical probability and high D-Dimer) in the algorithm we used. CTPA was regarded as gold standard. Dyspnea, chest pain, tachypnea, crackles were the most common symptoms and signs in patients having PE. Recent surgery within the risk factors was significantly higher in the PE present group. PE was diagnosed in 31 (55.4%) patients with CTPA. According to the empirical assessment 20 (64.5%) of the patients had high, 10 (32.3%) had intermediate and 1 (3.2%) had low clinical probability within 31 PE present group, while with Wells scoring 8 (25.8%) had high, 17 (54.8%) had intermediate and 6 (19.4%) had low clinical probability. Sensitivity of the empirical assessment and Wells scoring was 97%, 80% while the specificity was 16%, 68% respectively. Positive and negative predictive values of empirical assessment were 59%, 80% and these values of Wells scoring were 76%, 73% respectively. Thrombus was localized in main pulmonary arteries in 45.8% of patients with high clinical probability according to the empirical assessment. With Wells scoring in 45.5% of the high probability patients and only in 4.3% of the low probability patients thrombus was there. PE can be diagnosed noninvasively. Since PE can easily be underdiagnosed, empirical assessment which is more sensitive will be appropriate. There is a significant correlation between clinical assessments and presence of PE in CTPA. As the severity of clinical assessment increases, thrombus settles more proximal."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether asymptomatic VTE can be predicted by blood coagulation markers preoperatively or early after TKA. This prospective single-centre study enrolled 68 patients (6 men, 62 women; mean age: 71 years) who underwent TKA between September 2004 and August 2009. Sixteen-row multidetector computed tomography was performed 4 days before and after surgery for diagnosis of asymptomatic VTE. Blood samples were taken to measure the plasma levels of soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC), D-dimer and cross-linked fibrin degradation products by leukocyte elastase (e-XDP) at 4 days preoperatively, and at 1 hour, 1 day and 4 days postoperatively. The preoperative SFMC, D-dimer and e-XDP levels did not differ significantly between the thrombus (n=36) and no-thrombus (n=32) groups. D-dimer and e-XDP levels showed the most significant increases at days 4 and 1, respectively, after surgery in the thrombus group. With cut-off points of 7.5 Î¼g/ml for D-dimer and 8.2 U/ml for e-XDP, the sensitivities were 75% and 75%, and the specificities were 63% and 59%, respectively. By multiple logistic regression analysis, D-dimer at day 4 and e-XDP at day 1 postoperatively were independent markers for early diagnosis of VTE (odds ratio=1.61 and 1.19, P=0.01 and 0.04, respectively). The postoperative occurrence of new asymptomatic VTE may be predicted by D-dimer at day 4 and e-XDP at day 1 after TKA."

CD010864,0,6178853,0,"Role of dextran sulfate in urokinase therapy and evaluation of the effects by estimation of plasmin inhibitor, fibrinogenolytic degradation products, and fibrinolytic degradation products.","The present study was concerned with changes in APTT and coagulation-fibrinolytic inhibitors in 2 groups of patients receiving either UK with heparin or UK with heparin and dextran sulfate (DS). APTT just after UK treatment showed a significant prolongation in patients receiving combination treatment with DS, but contrarily a shortening in patients receiving those with DS. This result indicated the usefulness of DS combination in UK treatment. There was a marked difference between the responses of alpha 2-PI and antiplasmin to the treatment, presumably as a result of immune complex formation of the alpha 2-PI with plasmin. However, no marked difference in alpha 2-PI and AT-III existed both just after and at 24 hours after UK treatment in patients receiving UK (240,000 units) with both heparin and DS and those receiving UK (480,000 units) with heparin. Those results suggest that the dosage of UK can be reduced by combination of DS. Successful UK treatment in clinical cases resulted in a decrease of alpha 2-PI and an increase of fibrinogenolytic or fibrinolytic degradation products. For these reasons, effective UK treatment appears to require combination with DS and several treatment days under the condition with a decrease of alpha 2-PI (50%) and fibrinogenolysis with fibrinolysis, which are followed by administrations of UK."

Twenty-two patients with a total hip or knee arthroplasty received a mean of 611.4 mL unwashed but filtered shed blood. No complications were observed during or after the reinfusion of salvaged blood. Levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen increased significantly over time after retransfusion (P < .0001).

PAS sera and some selected paired CSF and serum specimens, were also analyzed for the presence of anti-phosphatidylserine (PS) and anti-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) antibodies. High levels of IgG and IgM ACA were synthesized intrathecally only in patients with neurosyphilis. Patients with other infectious or inflammatory neurological diseases very rarely showed detectable levels of ACA in serum and/or CSF. ACA were found not only in patients with untreated PAS but also in the serum of 3/7 patients with migraine, thus confirming a relationship between ACA and vascular disorders. The search for PS and PE antibodies disclosed that in PAS patients the serum titers of these antibodies mirrored ACA IgG and IgM titers, while they were never found in the CSF."
CD010864,0,16342831,0,Diagnosing the cause of chest pain.,"Chest pain presents a diagnostic challenge in outpatient family medicine. Noncardiac causes are common, but it is important not to overlook serious conditions such as an acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia. In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, most patients should have a chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram. Patients with chest pain that is predictably exertional, with electrocardiogram abnormalities, or with cardiac risk factors should be evaluated further with measurement of troponin levels and cardiac stress testing. Risk of pulmonary embolism can be determined with a simple prediction rule, and a D-dimer assay can help determine whether further evaluation with helical computed tomography or venous ultrasound is needed. Fever, egophony, and dullness to percussion suggest pneumonia, which can be confirmed with chest radiograph. Although some patients with chest pain have heart failure, this is unlikely in the absence of dyspnea; a brain natriuretic peptide level measurement can clarify the diagnosis. Pain reproducible by palpation is more likely to be musculoskeletal than ischemic. Chest pain also may be associated with panic disorder, for which patients can be screened with a two-item questionnaire. Clinical prediction rules can help clarify many of these diagnoses."
CD010864,0,17200782,1,Simple and safe exclusion of pulmonary embolism in outpatients using quantitative D-dimer and Wells' simplified decision rule.,"A safe and effective management strategy is pivotal in excluding pulmonary embolism (PE). The combination of Wells' simplified dichotomous clinical decision rule and D-dimer test is non-invasive and could be highly efficient, though its safety has not been widely studied. We evaluated safety and efficiency of this combination in excluding PE. Wells clinical decision rule was performed in 941 consecutive patients with suspected PE and, if patients had a score <or=4.0 points, a VIDAS D-dimer test followed. Patients with a normal D-dimer concentration had no further tests, PE was considered excluded, and patients did not receive anticoagulant treatment. Patients, in whom PE was excluded, were followed up for three months. Four hundred fifty patients (51.2%) had a clinical decision score =4.0 points and a normal D-dimer concentration. In 45 of these patients, during the initial diagnostic period additional objective testing, although not indicated, was performed, and PE was established in two patients. During three months of follow up no venous thromboembolic events (VTE) occurred. Therefore, the overall VTE failure rate was two of 450 (0.4% [95%CI 0-1.1]); the overall prevalence of PE was 12.3%. The diagnostic protocol could be completed and allowed a decision to be made in 90% of the study patients. This study has prospectively established the safety of a combination of a dichotomized clinical decision rule and D-dimer test in ruling out PE. The strategy proved highly efficient, since more than 50% of patients could be managed without the need for more invasive and expensive tests."

Because adults of the common dog hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum, were found in situ in several cases, we compared specific antibody responses in patients with EE or PE with those of individuals from various control groups. Sera were obtained from three patients with confirmed dog hookworm infection, 25 patients with EE/PE, 42 with other diagnosed gastrointestinal disorders, eight with human hookworm infection, 27 with other diagnosed parasitic infections, and 100 blood donors from the State of Tasmania, where A. caninum does not occur. They were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot for IgG and IgE antibodies to excretory-secretory (ES) antigens from adult A. caninum. In the ELISA, sera from 88% of EE/PE patients were positive for IgG and IgE antibodies to ES antigen. All eight patients infected with human hookworm (identified as A. duodenale in three) were also seropositive, while most of those with other parasitic infections, as well the blood donors, those with diagnosed gastrointestinal diseases, and the control subjects, were seronegative. In Western blots, sera from 92% of EE/PE patients demonstrated IgG and IgE antibodies to a component of ES antigen with a molecular weight of approximately 68 kD (Ac68), as did all sera from cases infected with human hookworms.

A soluble fibrin result of < or = 0.75 micrograms/ml showed a sensitivity of 100% for PE and a specificity of 12.8%, whereas a soluble fibrin result of < or = 1.35 micrograms/ml showed a sensitivity of 90.3% and a specificity of 49.4% for PE. The soluble fibrin assay has potential clinical utility in excluding PE."
CD010864,0,23249613,0,A new D-dimer cutoff in bedridden hospitalized elderly patients.,"Asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism are leading causes of morbidity following the hospitalization of elderly people. The diagnosis of DVT is supported by the D-dimer laboratory assay. The concentration of D-dimer increases in patients with DVT, but may be high in other conditions too (i.e. cancer, infections and inflammation). Old age coincides with a physiological increase in D-dimer values, and that is why D-dimer assay in the elderly is characteristically highly sensitive but scarcely specific. The aim of our study was to explore the reliability of different D-dimer cutoffs for the diagnosis of asymptomatic DVT in a population of bedridden hospitalized elderly patients. We studied 199 patients who were a mean 86.3âÂ±â6.7 years old. All participants underwent lower limb Doppler ultrasound (DUS) and D-dimer venous blood sampling on admission. In our cohort, the usual cutoff proved highly sensitive (100%), but its specificity was very poor (20.1%). To find a higher cutoff that could improve the method's specificity, we analyzed our data using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The resulting D-dimer cutoff of 492âÎ¼g/l enabled us to retain the same sensitivity while improving the test's specificity to 39.1%, with a consequent improvement in its positive predictive value and accuracy. In addition to improving the method's reliability, this result may be helpful in clinical practice, in both medical wards and nursing homes. By adopting a cutoff of 492âÎ¼g/l, clinicians could significantly increase the proportion of older patients in whom DVT can be safely ruled out, reducing referrals for DUS and administration of heparin, with consequent clinical, practical and economic advantages."

The aim of our research was to assess if the BNP concentration variation may be useful in the diagnosis and therapy. Peptide synthesis takes place mainly in the ventricular myocardium. We selected 102 patients: 27 control subjects, and 75 admitted to the emergency and reception department for dyspnea and/or precordialgia and/or palpitations. At the beginning they were considered as one group only, and then they were divided into groups according to the diagnosis: 20 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with reversion to sinus rhythm in the first week; 20 with acute pulmonary edema; 22 with acute coronary syndrome without electrocardiographic ST-segment changes; 13 with compensated dilated cardiomyopathy. Our research assessed that the BNP activation and secretion are evident especially in patients with heart failure and remains at the high level until the administration of an effective therapy and then they reach a balance with values higher than the standards, while in the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and in acute coronary syndrome they rise and come back to the standard levels or even at lower levels after the disease solution. For this reason, BNP reiterated measurements allow to assess treatment efficacy, even at home, and to optimize the therapy. The main limit of BNP diagnostic role is in the need of knowing in advance the specific values for each patient. The BNP concentration evaluation in the acute phase is necessary to differentiate patients with dyspnea due to heart failure from those with pulmonary pathologies, while the BNP assessment in the acute coronary syndrome predicted exitus or heart failure manifestations."

CD010864,0,17326064,0,Falsely elevated cardiac troponin I levels.,"The measurement of cardiac troponins (cTn) is of considerable usefulness in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. Abnormal levels of serum cTn are occasionally found in patients who are not suffering a myocardial infarction. This may be observed in several well-known situations including pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, myocarditis, coronary vasospasm, sepsis, congestive heart failure, supraventricular tachycardia with hemodynamic compromise, re-nal insufficiency, and prolonged strenuous endurance exercise. Endogenous antibodies such as heterophile antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and other autoantibodies are known to interfere with the immunoassay measurements of many different analytes, including the widely used Abbot AxSYM cTnI analyzer. Other sources of circulating antibodies include immunotherapies, vaccinations, or blood transfusions that may interfere with these immunoassays as well. We examine the case of a 48-year-old man with a history of hypercholesterolemia and obesity who presented with chest pain and was found to have elevated Tn I levels on two separate occasions. Further work-up revealed that the Tn I levels were spuriously elevated because the patient's blood revealed a normal cTnI level when mixed with polyethylene glycol to inactivate any antibodies interfering with the cTnI assay."
CD010864,0,23173677,0,Aprotinin reduces the procalcitonin rise associated with complex cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass.,"Aprotinin, a nonspecific serine protease inhibitor, has been primarily used as a haemostatic drug in cardiac surgery with cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB). This study investigated the effect of aprotinin on the post-operative levels of procalcitonin (PCT) and a set of cytokines in patients undergoing pulmonary artery endarterectomy (PEA). We analyzed 60 patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension undergoing PEA. 30 patients (Group A) were treated with aprotinin (2,00,00 IU prior anesthesia, then 2,00,00 IU in CPB prime and 50,00 IU per hour continuously); a further 30 patients (Group B) received tranexamic Acid (1 g before anesthesia, 1 g after full heparin dose and 2 g in CPB prime). PCT, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 arterial concentrations were measured from before until 72 hours after surgery. Aprotinin significantly affected early post-PEA plasma PCT. Patients treated with aprotinin (Group A) had lower peak PCT levels compared to patients in Group B (1.52 ng/ml versus 2.18, p=0.024). Postoperative peak values of PCT and IL-6 correlated closely in both groups (r=0.78, r=0.83 respectively). Aprotinin attenuates the post-PEA increase of PCT in the same manner as other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Significant correlation between PCT and IL-6 post-surgery may be indicative of an indirect IL-6-mediated pathway of PCT alteration."

Children diagnosed with PE at a large tertiary centre over an 8-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-six children with radiologically proven PE were identified, 31 males and 25 females, median age 12 years. Eighty-four per cent had symptoms of PE. Risk factors for thromboembolism were present in 54 patients (96.4%); most commonly immobility (58.9%), central venous line (35.7%) and recent surgery (28.6%). Investigation revealed a thrombophilic abnormality in 14/40 patients (35%). Concurrent deep vein thrombosis was confirmed in 31 patients (55.4%), predominantly lower limb. D dimer was elevated at presentation in 26/30 patients (86.7%). Eight patients underwent systemic thrombolysis. An inferior vena cava filter was placed in five patients. Therapy was complicated by major haemorrhage in 12 patients (21.4%). The majority (82.1%) had complete or partial resolution of PE following a median of 3 months anticoagulation. Seven patients had a recurrent thromboembolic event and 12 patients died (mortality 21.4%); five due to thromboembolism (8.9%) and two due to haemorrhage. Risk factors for PE in children are distinct from adults and morbidity and mortality is significant. Multicentre prospective studies are required to determine optimal treatment and long-term outcome of childhood PE."

CD010864,0,16398655,1,The performance of STA-Liatest D-dimer assay in out-patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"Several studies have shown that D-dimer can reliably rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) in out-patients. However, various assays have different sensitivities and specificities to detect thrombosis. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of STA-Liatest D-Di in out-patients referred for suspected PE in a prospective outcome study. 495 consecutive patients referred to Ãstfold Hospital Trust-Fredrikstad, Norway for suspected PE between February 2002 and December 2003, were recruited in a study evaluating a decision-based algorithm combining clinical probability (CP), D-dimer, and multi-slice computer tomography (MSCT). D-dimer was performed as a first step test. No further testing was carried out in patients with D-dimer < or =0.4 mg/l and low/intermediate CP. The remaining patients proceeded to MSCT. All patients were followed up for 3 months to assess the 3-month thromboembolic risk. The final cohort consisted of 432 patients. PE was diagnosed in 102 (23%) patients. At a D-dimer cut-off point of 0.4 mg/l the tests had the highest sensitivity (100%) and specificity (36%). It safely ruled out PE in 120 (28%) patients. Kappa-coefficients for comparisons versus VIDAS and Asserachrom showed good concordance. STA-Liatest is a reliable and effective assay that can safely rule out PE in out-patients with a performance comparable with that of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based d-dimer levels."
CD010864,0,19119691,0,[Has high-definition spiral computed tomography changed the management of patients with acute pulmonary embolism?].,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common condition carrying a significant degree of mortality if not diagnosed early. The diagnosis of PE is challenging, because of the non-specific nature of its clinical features. For many years the diagnostic strategies for PE have mainly involved ventilation/perfusion lung scan as the chief diagnostic procedure, often associated with a few clinical models of pre-test probability and the D-dimer test. These modalities of diagnosing PE, though quite satisfactory in various clinical settings, show several limitations, the most important one being the high rate of non-diagnostic procedures. The introduction of computed tomography (CT) has changed the diagnostic strategies and has become the main diagnostic procedure for diagnosing PE. CT is undergoing a rapid technological upgrade, which will open in the near future new frontiers in the diagnosis of PE. Nonetheless, CT carries a number of limitations, which should be carefully identified. This article reviews the evidences on both the traditional and newer diagnostic strategies for PE, outlines their strengths and weaknesses and describes future applications of CT for diagnosing PE."
CD010864,0,21698453,0,Multi-dimensional MR spectroscopy: towards a better understanding of hepatic encephalopathy.,"Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is normally diagnosed by neuropsychological (NP) tests. The goals of this study were to quantify cerebral metabolites, separate glutamate (Glu) from glutamine (Gln) in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) as well as healthy subjects using the prior-knowledge fitting (ProFit) algorithm on data acquired by two-dimensional (2D) localized correlated spectroscopy (L-COSY) on two different MR scanners, and to correlate the metabolite changes with neuropsychological (NP) tests. We studied 14 MHE patients and 18 healthy controls using a GE 1.5Â T Signa MR scanner. Another group of 16 MHE patients and 18 healthy controls were studied using a Siemens 1.5Â T Avanto MR scanner. The following parameters were used for L-COSY: TR/TEâ=â2Â s/30Â ms, 3âÃâ3âÃâ3Â cm(3) voxel size, 96 Ît(1) increments with 8 averages per Ît(1). Using the ProFit algorithm, we were able to differentiate Gln from Glu on the GE 1.5Â T data in the medial frontal white/gray matter. The ratios of myo-inositol (mI), Glu, total choline, scyllo-inositol (sI), phosphoethanolamine (PE), and total N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) showed statistically significant decline in HE patients compared to healthy controls, while the ratio of Gln was significantly increased. Similar trend was seen in the ProFit quantified Siemens 1.5Â T data in the frontal and occipito-parietal white/gray regions. Among the NP domain scores, motor function, cognitive speed, executive function and the global scores showed significant differences. Excellent correlations between various NP domains and metabolite ratios were also observed. ProFit based cerebral metabolite quantitation enhances the understanding and basis of the current hypothesis of MHE."
CD010864,0,22152935,0,[The optimal duration of anticoagulant treatment following pulmonary embolism].,"The optimal course of oral anticoagulant therapy is determined according to the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism after stopping therapy and the risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding. Clinical risk factors appear to be important in predicting the risk of recurrence whereas the influence of biochemical and morphological tests is uncertain. The risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism is low when the initial episode was provoked by a reversible major risk factor (surgery): 3 months of anticoagulation is sufficient. Conversely, the risk is high when venous thromboembolism was unprovoked or associated with persistent risk factor (cancer): 6 months or more prolonged anticoagulation is necessary. After this first estimation, the duration of anticoagulation may be modulated according to the presence or absence of certain additional risk factors (major thrombophilia, chronic pulmonary hypertension, massive pulmonary embolism): 6 months if pulmonary embolism was provoked and 12 to 24 months if pulmonary embolism was unprovoked. If the risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding is high, the duration of anticoagulation should be shortened (3 months if pulmonary embolism was provoked and 3 to 6 months if it was unprovoked). Lastly, if pulmonary embolism occurred in association with cancer, anticoagulation should be conducted for 6 months or more if the cancer is active or treatment is on going. Despite an increasing knowledge of the risk factors for recurrent venous thromboembolism, a number of issues remain unresolved. Randomised trials comparing different durations of anticoagulation are needed."
CD010864,0,12599936,0,Diagnosis of venous thromboembolic disease in cancer patients.,"Venous thromboembolic disease is a common but likely underdiagnosed condition in the cancer patient population. Timely and accurate diagnosis of venous thromboembolism is imperative due to the unacceptable morbidity and mortality associated with a misdiagnosis. Because diagnosis of the condition based on clinical grounds alone is unreliable, physicians should select an appropriate objective diagnostic test to confirm or refute their clinical impressions. Compression duplex ultrasound is the best initial imaging test for both suspected upper- and lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is a valid alternative when ultrasound is inconclusive, but contrast venography remains the ""gold standard."" Suspected pulmonary embolism should be initially evaluated by helical (spiral) computed tomography (CT) or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy, the former being preferred in cases of obvious pulmonary or pleural disease. Indeterminate studies should prompt performance of contrast pulmonary angiography. Inferior vena cava thrombosis is also best assessed by contrast venography, with MRV and CT reserved as alternative imaging modalities. Evidence to date suggests that D-dimer assays remain unreliable in excluding venous thromboembolism in cancer patients. A newer latex agglutination D-dimer assay may prove to be clinically useful in this setting."

We conducted a prospective study in which we performed a common immuno-turbidimetric CRP test and a rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) D-dimer test in 259 consecutive outpatients with suspected PE at the emergency department of a teaching hospital. We assessed clinical probability of PE by a validated prediction rule overridden by clinical judgment. Patients with D-dimer levels > or = 500 microg/l underwent a work-up consisting of lower-limb venous ultrasound, spiral computerized tomography, ventilation-perfusion scan, or pulmonary angiography. Patients were followed up for three months. Seventy-seven (30%) of the patients had PE. The CRP alone had a sensitivity of 84% (95% confidence interval [CI).: 74 to 92%) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 87% (95% CI: 78 to 93%) at a cutpoint of 5 mg/l. Overall, 61 (24%) patients with a low clinical probability of PE had a CRP < 5 mg/l. Due to the low prevalence of PE (9%) in this subgroup, the NPV increased to 97% (95% CI: 89 to 100%). The D-dimer (cutpoint 500 micro g/l) showed a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 95 to 100%) and a NPV of 100% (95% CI: 94 to 100%) irrespective of clinical probability and accurately rule out PE in 56 (22%) patients.

Providing effective VTE prophylaxis, while at the same time providing definitive care for the trauma patient, can be a nightmare. This review will first discuss the incidence and prevalence of VTE, as well as investigate the condition's diagnosis and treatment. Solutions to frequently encountered clinical dilemmas in managing VTE in trauma patients are considered in the form of frequently asked questions.

The patient exhibited a normal PC antigen level, normal chromogenic activity (using Protac as PC activator) but markedly reduced coagulometric activity. After adsorption of patient plasma onto Al(OH)3, between 30% and 45% PC antigen/chromogenic activity but no coagulometric activity was detectable in the supernatant. The dysfunctional molecule exhibited reduced affinity for a Ca++ dependent anti-protein C monoclonal antibody as detected by specific ELISA assay. Immunoblotting experiments showed that PC Padua 2 had an increased MW (95 kD v 65 kD for normal PC). The lesion responsible was determined by PCR/direct sequencing to be a heterozygous CGT/TGT transition in exon 3 of the protein C gene resulting in the substitution of Arg by Cys at residue--1 in the pro-peptide leader sequence. The presence of a high MW PC was consistent with the fact that (part of) the propeptide (at least Cys-1) still was attached to the protein C molecule. This finding could also explain the strongly reduced affinity of PC Padua 2 for the Ca++ dependent anti-protein C monoclonals."

The measurement of D-dimers can be performed with ELISA or immunoturbidimetric methods suited to emergency, using a mouse monoclonal antibody as capture and/or revelation antibody. Therefore, the presence in patient's plasma of human antibody mouse (HAMA) that binds the mouse antiglobulin used in immunoassays can lead to false negative or false positive results. In a young woman presenting repetitive thoracic pain suggestive of a pulmonary embolism, a major discrepancy was found between one result of D-dimers above the cut-off with an immunoturbidimetric method (STA Liatest D-DI; Diagnostica Stago) and one result below the cut-off with a sandwich method (Vidas D-Dimer Exclusion; bioMÃ©rieux). HAMA, which is known to be responsible for this type of discrepancy, was detected in the patient serum. The false positive result probably impaired with the management of patient. Taking in charge the patient should take into account the possible presence of this antibody. Interference by heterophilic antibodies is not easily detected by the laboratory. Even if their frequency is low, it remains a difficult problem for the biologist. Suspicion generally arises from inconsistency between the clinical data and immunoassay results.

CD010864,0,11535885,0,Practical utility of the D-dimer assay for excluding thromboembolism in severely injured trauma patients.,We have advocated the use of a D-dimer assay to exclude the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in surgical and trauma patients suspected of having these diagnoses. Injury is known to increase D-dimer levels independent of thromboembolism. The purpose of this study was to assess the period after injury over which the D-dimer assay remains positive because of injury exclusive of thromboembolism.
CD010864,0,23143066,0,Value of cardiac troponin I for predicting in-hospital occurrence of hypotension in stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism.,"Although cardiac troponin I (cTnI) elevations during acute pulmonary embolism (PE) are predictive of in-hospital death, it is not clear whether cTnI measurements at emergency department (ED) admission are predictive of the occurrence of hypotension. The study subjects included all consecutive patients with acute PE (diagnosed by chest computed tomography angiography) in the ED between January 2006 and December 2011. All underwent cTnI tests at ED admission and were divided into two groups based on the occurrence of hypotension within 24 h. Of 457 stable patients with acute PE who were admitted to the ED during the study period, 301 patients were included. Within 24 h of hospitalization, 27 (9.0%) developed hypotension. The patients who developed hypotension had a significantly higher mean cTnI concentration than did the remaining patients (1.01 vs. 0.14 ng/mL, P < 0.00). They were also more likely to be treated with thrombolytic therapy and had higher 28-day and 6-month mortality rates. Cardiac TnI elevation (>0.05 ng/mL) at ED admission was a strong predictor of the development of hypotension within 24 h (odds ratio, 8.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-26.1; P = 0.00). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of elevated cTnI were 85%, 66%, 20%, and 98%, respectively. This study suggests that a normal cTnI nearly rules out subsequent development of hypotension within 24 h. This may help to select those patients who would benefit most from intensive clinical surveillance and escalated treatment."
CD010864,0,23745332,0,[The usefulness of natriuretic peptides measurements in the diagnostics of chosen cardiovascular diseases].,"Natriuretic peptides compose the group of neurohormones produced by the myocardium in response to its walls stretching caused by the volume or pressure overload. They restrain the sodium kidney reabsorbtion, thus increasing the diuresis and natriuresis. They also participate in blood pressure, initial load as well as the water-mineral balance regulation. The main representatives of this group are ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) and BNP (brain netriuretic peptide). With regard to slow dynamics of the serum levels changes, the measurements of BNP play an important role in cardiological diagnotics. Its serum concentration raises in these cardiovascular diseases that are connected with the left ventricle overload. So it can be treated as a specific left ventricle dysfunction marker, whereas its high concentrations correlate with the functional class according to NYHA. It also can be used in risk stratification in patients with the acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism, as well as helping to differentiate the pulmonary and cardiac causes of acute dyspnoea. The serum level of NT-proBNP (N-terminal propeptide of brain natriuretic peptide) is also the independent predictive factor of the recurrence of atrial fibrillation after the restoring the sinus rhythm."

Ideally the test should be objective and a test that could be run on the routine coagulometer would obviate the need for additional investment in alternative hardware. A new automated latex particle immunoassay (MDA D-dimer) that can be run on a routine coagulometer was compared with a well established enzyme linked fluorescent assay (VIDAS D-dimer) on the basis of their ability to exclude venous thromboembolism. The assays were compared in 49 patients presenting to the emergency department with clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. After objective diagnostic imaging, 20 patients were confirmed to have venous thromboembolism. There was strong agreement between the assays in individual patients. Using a cut-off of 500 micrograms/l, both tests had a sensitivity of 100% and therefore a negative predictive value of 100%, however the MDA test would have spared more patients (20% vs. 12%) from further testing if a negative D-dimer was used to rule-out the diagnosis. It was concluded that a rapid, objective latex D-dimer test run on a routine coagulometer (MDA D-dimer) can be used to exclude the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism."
CD010864,0,2494957,0,Antibody to phosphatidylethanolamine in a patient with lupus anticoagulant and thrombosis.,"Most patients with lupus anticoagulant (LA) activity have coincident antibodies to a group of negatively charged phospholipids, and its is suggested that LA and anticardiolipin tests detect antibodies with overlapping specificities. Some discordance between the two assays has been described, however. One patient presenting with severe thrombotic disease (recurrent deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, inferior venocaval obstruction, myocardial infarction, and digital gangrene) showed strong LA activity in February 1987. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed no binding to the negatively charged phospholipids cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid, but binding to zwitterionic phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was demonstrated. Inhibition studies and affinity purification confirmed this finding. Interestingly, the serum did not bind to the kaolin cephalin clotting time reagent when used as antigen in an ELISA. The pathogenic significance of anti-PE antibodies and their relation to LA remains to be clarified. Further studies of the occurrence of anti-PE antibodies in patients with LA activity who have negative anticardiolipin tests are suggested."

A 29 years-old male with a previous deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower left limb three years earlier, developed a DVT in the right lower limb after a trauma of the knee that required immobilization, was associated to pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosed by gammagraphic methods. The phlebographic study showed femoro-iliaco-caval venous thrombosis. The proband's father and a younger brother had a previous history of thrombotic episodes. The following tests, were performed in the proband and relatives: prothrombin time, aPTT, thrombin time, fibrinogen, (Von Clauss), antithrombin III (chromogenic), protein C and protein S (coagulometry and ELISA), plasminogen (chromogenic) and lupus anticoagulant (ITT, dRVVT, aCL). RAPC was evaluated in two different samples. The proband study was performed under oral anticoagulation treatment (OAT). Control groups were: 21 blood donors and 12 OAT patients. The results showed a decreased response to APC in the proband (ratio 1.5) and relatives: father (1.4), brothers (1.5 and 1.5), while the mother was within the normal range (> or = 2). In normal controls and OAT patients the ratio was over 2. No other abnormalities were detected in the assays performed. It is concluded that RAPC is the cause of this familial trombophilia. RAPC should be included in the evaluation study of trombophilia."

CD010864,0,22648487,0,The diagnostic management of recurrent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.,"The diagnostic management of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a clinical dilemma. Clinical decision rules are well validated in patients with a first episode of clinically suspected VTE but are not validated in patients with a suspected recurrent event. D-dimer testing could safely exclude a recurrent VTE but is subject to several limitations. Imaging could objectively exclude or establish the diagnosis of recurrent VTE, but due to persistent residual abnormalities after the first or previous event, imaging interpretation can be difficult. To limit the presence of uncertain imaging test results, a standardized baseline examination after anticoagulation cessation should be considered. This review will elaborate on these issues and will discuss the recent advancements in this area."

In patients with low or moderate clinical probability most quantitative D-dimer tests allow to exclude PE safely. A positive proximal venous ultrasound enables to confirm PE but the sensitivity is too low to exclude the diagnosis.

CD010864,0,22648488,0,Triaging in pulmonary embolism.,"Risk stratification of patients with pulmonary embolism represents an important step and may help to guide initial therapeutic management. Pulmonary embolism can be stratified into several groups, with different risk of early death or complications based on the presence of several risk factors. High-risk pulmonary embolism is defined by shock or peripheral signs of hypoperfusion. It is a life-threatening emergency with high short-term mortality (>25%) requiring specific therapeutic strategy with inotropic agents and fibrinolysis. In normotensive patients with pulmonary embolism, the presence of right ventricular dysfunction assessed by echocardiography or myocardial injury based on elevated levels of biomarkers, is associated with an intermediate risk of early death. These patients require close monitoring, and the role of thrombolytic treatment is currently assessed in a large trial. Lastly, patients with normotensive pulmonary embolism and without right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial injury have a low risk of death and complications. These patients may be candidates for home treatment. Several scores combining these risk factors have been described."

We now report the detection in vivo and quantitative analysis of LG/isoLG adducts that incorporate the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) into LG/isoLG-hydroxylactams. Notably, LC-MS/MS detection of these hydroxylactams is achieved with samples that are an order of magnitude smaller and sample processing is much simpler and less time consuming than required for measuring protein-derived LG/isoLG-lysyl lactams. A key feature of our protocol is treatment of biological phospholipid extracts with phospholipase A(2) to generate mainly 1-palmitoyl-2-lysoPE-hydroxylactams from heterogeneous mixtures of phospholipids with a variety of acyl groups on the 2 position. Over 160% higher mean levels of LG/isoLG-PE-hydroxylactam (P<0.001) were detected in liver from chronic ethanol-fed mice (32.4+/-6.3 ng/g, n=6) compared to controls (12.1+/-1.5 ng/g, n=4), and mean levels in plasma from patients with age-related macular degeneration (5.2+/-0.4 ng/ml, n=15) were elevated approximately 53% (P<0.0001) compared to those of healthy volunteers (3.4+/-0.1 ng/ml, n=15). Just as LG/isoLG-protein adducts provide a dosimeter of oxidative injury, this study suggests that LG/isoLG-PE-hydroxylactams are potential biomarkers for assessing risk for oxidative stress-stimulated diseases."
CD010864,0,23199733,0,Oligolamellar vesicles for covalent immobilization and stabilization of D-amino acid oxidase.,"Oligolamellar phospholipid vesicles incorporated with d-amino acid oxidase from porcine kidney (OV-DAO) were prepared by encapsulating pre-formed enzyme-bound unilamellar vesicles (UV-DAO) with bilayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC). The bilayer of UV-DAO was composed of POPC, 30 mol% of cholesterol and 15 mol% of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(glutaryl) (NGPE) that was responsible for covalent linking to D-amino acid oxidase (DAO). OV-DAO and UV-DAO showed the activity to catalyze the oxidation of D-alanine as measured based on the hydrogen peroxide produced. The oligolamellar and unilamellar structure of OV-DAO and UV-DAO, respectively was elucidated based on the quenching characteristics of bilayers-incorporated fluorescent lipid 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl-phosphoethanolamine (NBD-PE) and the size distribution of the vesicles measured with the dynamic light scattering method. The enzyme activity of OV-DAO and UV-DAO was significantly stabilized at 50Â°C compared to that of free DAO at the fixed enzyme concentration of 3.29 Î¼g/mL. At the temperature, OV-DAO and UV-DAO showed the remaining activity of 52.7 and 29.6%, respectively at the incubation time of 20 min while free DAO was completely deactivated. Thus the dimeric form of DAO could be stabilized by its coupling to the surface of UV-DAO membrane being the inner bilayer of OV-DAO. Furthermore, the thermal denaturation of DAO and dissociation of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) from the subunits of enzyme were prevented in the aqueous phase formed between the bilayers of OV-DAO."

Because of its early onset (before 34 weeks) and the potential for serious outcomes, severe, early-onset preeclampsia (sePE) should be regarded as a different form of preeclampsia. It is an important cause of preterm birth and fetal growth restriction and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. As there is no diagnostic test yet available for this disease, we used a proteomic approach to identify novel plasma biomarkers for developing severe, early-onset preeclampsia. We conducted case-control studies comparing nulliparous women with severe preeclampsia requiring delivery prior to 34 weeks of gestation with healthy nulliparous women matched by gestational age at sampling. Plasma was depleted of albumin and IgG and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE). Seven specific plasma proteins for early-onset preeclampsia were detected by mass spectrometry had statistically significant expression differences when compared to controls. The expression of complement component C4A and apolipoprotein A-I were validated by immunoblotting. The complement component C4A in the plasmas of sePE women is lower than the severe, late-onset PE (slPE) women [mean Â± SD; 3.05 Â± 0.14 times reference level (normal/sePE) in sePE women vs. 2.73 Â± 0.10 times reference level (normal/slPE) in slPE women, P < 0.05]. Apolipoprotein A-I is higher in sePE women than slPE women [mean Â± SD; 1.58 Â± 0.14 times reference level (sePE/normal) in sePE women vs. 1.04 Â± 0.16 times reference level (slPE/normal) in slPE women, P < 0.05]. Furthermore, C4A can accurately distinguish severe PE (sePE and slPE) from mild PE (mePE and mlPE) and was proved by the results of ELISA. Further studies have been done to determine the relation between PE and hypoxia. JAR cells were cultured under hypoxia for 72 h. Total cellular proteins were gathered and lysed. Lower C4A and higher apolipoprotein A-I had been observed in JAR of hypoxia conditions than normoxia conditions through western blotting. The result proved that PE is correlated with hypoxia. In summary, C4A and apolipoprotein A-I are able to function as markers to distinguish ePE women from lPE women, and severe PE from mild PE, or perhaps even as disease predictors that might become relevant for diagnostics."

Several issues regarding its method and clinical indications remain controversial, however. Although isolated calf vein thrombosis does not seem to have a significant adverse outcome in the short term, scanning the calf only in patients with localized symptoms or signs is cost-effective. Bilateral examination is indicated in high-risk patients or when screening asymptomatic patients. When negative, a complete DUS examination of the proximal and distal veins, at least down to the level of the popliteal trifurcation, allows withholding anticoagulant therapy without the risk of major complications. This examination may be repeated if signs or symptoms worsen. Some populations of asymptomatic patients at high risk of DVT may benefit from DUS screening. Bilateral DUS examination of lower limb veins should be performed as the initial examination in the workflow of pulmonary embolism only in patients with risk factors for DVT. Recurrent thrombosis is a challenging diagnosis for all imaging modalities. A diagnostic strategy combining clinical probability score and D-dimer test may refine the selection of patients. The pitfalls and limitations of venous DUS are related to vein anatomy, flow changes, technical issues, and operator expertise."

Some patients may be genetically conditioned to develop CTEPH, but only a few fibrinogen mutations and an increase in the frequency of polymorphisms of human leukocyte antigens have been described. Hereditary coagulation defects are no more prevalent in patients with CTEPH than in controls, except for factor VIII and antiphospholipid antibodies. Some studies have analyzed differences in the expression of type 1 tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor in the thrombus of patients with CTEPH (compared with thrombi of acute pulmonary thromboembolism [PTE]) and suggest that thrombosis in situ can contribute to the persistence of the coagulum and disease progression. Some characteristics of acute PTE have been associated with its progression to CTEPH, such as idiopathic PTE, large perfusion defects, massive PTE, recurrent PTE and pulmonary hypertension persisting at 5 weeks after the thrombotic event. Several clinical factors that increase the risk of CTEPH have been described, such as splenectomy, ventricular shunts, and chronic inflammatory diseases.

Well-validated clinical prediction rules are available to determine the pretest probability of DVT and pulmonary embolism. When the likelihood of DVT is low, a negative D-dimer assay result excludes DVT. Likewise, a low pretest probability with a negative D-dimer assay result excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. If the likelihood of DVT is intermediate to high, compression ultrasonography should be performed. Impedance plethysmography, contrast venography, and magnetic resonance venography are available to assess for DVT, but are not widely used. Pulmonary embolism is usually a consequence of DVT and is associated with greater mortality. Multidetector computed tomography angiography is the diagnostic test of choice when the technology is available and appropriate for the patient. It is warranted in patients who may have a pulmonary embolism and a positive D-dimer assay result, or in patients who have a high pretest probability of pulmonary embolism, regardless of D-dimer assay result. Ventilation-perfusion scanning is an acceptable alternative to computed tomography angiography in select settings. Pulmonary angiography is needed only when the clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism remains high, even when less invasive study results are negative. In unstable emergent cases highly suspicious for pulmonary embolism, echocardiography may be used to evaluate for right ventricular dysfunction, which is indicative of but not diagnostic for pulmonary embolism."

D-dimer concentration in blood is the best laboratory screening test, and chest CT has become the most widespread imaging test. Treatment requires rapid and accurate risk stratification before haemodynamic decompensation and the development of cardiogenic shock. Anticoagulation is the foundation of therapy. Right-ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography and higher than normal concentrations of troponin identify high-risk patients who might need escalation of therapy with thrombolysis or embolectomy even if the blood pressure is normal on presentation. When patients are admitted to medical wards or when patients undergo surgery, their physicians should prescribe prophylactic measures to prevent PE. After hospital discharge, prophylaxis should continue for about a month for patients at high risk of thromboembolism."
CD010864,0,22143281,0,Diagnostic imaging and risk stratification of patients with acute pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most common acute cardiovascular disease after myocardial infarction and stroke. The prompt diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of patients with acute PE can reduce mortality. Multidetector row computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the most common study used to make the diagnosis of acute PE. CTPA may additionally identify right heart dysfunction or alternative diagnoses. There is a growing body of evidence that computed tomography signs of right heart failure predict patients at higher risk of mortality. At the same time, CTPA has about a 6-fold greater whole body effective dose than ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy, and a much higher dose to breast tissue in particular. V/Q scintigraphy should be considered for patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast or for patients with normal chest radiographs, especially young women. Compression ultrasonography of the proximal lower extremities, an imaging study without ionizing radiation, should be considered for patients suspected of acute PE with signs of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis or for patients with negative CTPA or V/Q scan with discordant clinical probability. This article reviews factors affecting the selection of the best imaging test for a particular patient suspected of acute PE, performance characteristics of diagnostic imaging tests, and imaging findings that correlate with higher mortality."
CD010864,0,18570439,0,Amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein: evidence of a pivotal role of glutaminyl cyclase in generation of pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta.,"Compelling evidence suggests that N-terminally truncated and pyroglutamyl-modified amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides play a major role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Posttranslational formation of pyroglutamic acid (pGlu) at position 3 or 11 of Abeta implies cyclization of an N-terminal glutamate residue rendering the modified peptide degradation resistant, more hydrophobic, and prone to aggregation. Previous studies using artificial peptide substrates suggested the potential involvement of the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase in generation of pGlu-Abeta. Here we show that glutaminyl cyclase (QC) catalyzes the formation of Abeta 3(pE)-40/42 after amyloidogenic processing of APP in two different cell lines, applying specific ELISAs and Western blotting based on urea-PAGE. Inhibition of QC by the imidazole derivative PBD150 led to a blockage of Abeta 3(pE)-42 formation. Apparently, the QC-catalyzed formation of N-terminal pGlu is favored in the acidic environment of secretory compartments, which is also supported by double-immunofluorescence labeling of QC and APP revealing partial colocalization. Finally, initial investigations focusing on the molecular pathway leading to the generation of truncated Abeta peptides imply an important role of the amino acid sequence near the beta-secretase cleavage site. Introduction of a single-point mutation, resulting in an amino acid substitution, APP(E599Q), i.e., at position 3 of Abeta, resulted in significant formation of Abeta 3(pE)-40/42. Introduction of the APP KM595/596NL ""Swedish"" mutation causing overproduction of Abeta, however, surprisingly diminished the concentration of Abeta 3(pE)-40/42. The study provides new cell-based assays for the profiling of small molecule inhibitors of QC and points to conspicuous differences in processing of APP depending on sequence at the beta-secretase cleavage site."

CD010864,0,7974382,0,D-dimer determination to exclude pulmonary embolism: a two-step approach using latex assay as a screening tool.,"D-dimer (DD), when measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), is a valuable test to exclude venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, DD ELISA technique is not appropriate for emergency use and the available agglutination latex assays are not sensitive enough to be used as an alternative to rule out the diagnosis of VTE. Latex assays could still be used as screening tests. We tested this hypothesis by comparing DD levels measured by ELISA and latex assays in 334 patients suspected of pulmonary embolism. All but one patient with a positive (DD > or = 500 ng/ml) latex assay had DD levels higher than 500 ng/ml with the ELISA assay. Accordingly, ELISA technique could be restricted to patients with a negative result in latex assay. This two-step approach would have spared about 50% of ELISA in our cohort. In conclusion, our data indicate that a latex test can be used as a first diagnostic step to rule out pulmonary embolism provided a negative result is confirmed by ELISA and the performance of the latex assay used has been assessed properly."

CD010864,0,21068682,0,Fructose addition to a glucose supplement modifies perceived exertion during strength and endurance exercise.,"The addition of fructose (F) to a glucose (G) supplement may modify the metabolic response during exercise; however, its effect on perceived exertion (PE) and its influence on postprandial metabolism have not been jointly studied in different types of exercise. This study sought to assess the acute effects of F addition to a G supplement on PE and on the postprandial metabolic response during a single bout of either strength exercise (SE) or endurance exercise (EE). Twenty physically trained men ingested an oral dose of G or GF 15 minutes before starting a 30-minute session of SE (10 sets of 10 repetitions of half squat) or EE (cycling). The combination resulted in 4 randomized interventions in a crossover design in which all subjects performed all experimental conditions: G + SE, GF + SE, G + EE, and GF + SE. Perceived exertion, heart rate (HR), G, insulin, lactate, and urinary catecholamine levels were measured before exercise, during the exercise, and during acute recovery. Perceived exertion during exercise was lower for GF than for G during SE and EE (mean Â± SD; 8.95 Â± 0.62 vs. 9.26 Â± 0.65, p < 0.05 and 7.47 Â± 0.84 vs. 7.74 Â± 0.93, p < 0.05, respectively). The glycemic peak in GF + SE was lower than in G + SE (p < 0.05), and there was a second peak during recovery (p < 0.05), whereas in EE, no difference in blood G levels was noted between G and GF supplements. Moreover, HR, urinary adrenalin, and noradrenalin were lower in GF than in G (p < 0.05), though only for EE. The results showed that PE is positively affected by GF supplementation for both SE and EE and thus may be a useful dietary strategy for helping to achieve higher training loads."
CD010864,0,12538548,0,Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"No single noninvasive test for pulmonary embolism is both sensitive and specific. Some tests are good for ""ruling in"" pulmonary embolism (e.g., helical CT) and some tests are good for ""ruling out"" pulmonary embolism (e.g., D-dimer); others are able to do both but are often nondiagnostic (e.g., ventilation-perfusion lung scanning). For optimal efficiency, choice of the initial diagnostic test should be guided by clinical assessment of the probability of pulmonary embolism and by patient characteristics that may influence test accuracy. This selective approach to testing enables pulmonary embolism to be diagnosed or excluded in a minimum number of steps. However, even with the appropriate use of combinations of noninvasive tests, it is often not possible to definitively diagnose or exclude pulmonary embolism at initial presentation. Most of these patients can be managed safely without treatment or pulmonary angiography by repeating ultrasound testing of the proximal veins after one and 2 weeks to detect evolving deep vein thrombosis. Helical CT and MRI are rapidly improving as diagnostic tests for pulmonary embolism and are expected to become central to its evaluation."

CD010864,0,2663179,0,Acute respiratory emergencies in emergency treatment of the injured athlete.,"Exercise and physical fitness are becoming increasingly popular in our society. As a result there are more individuals who are at risk for the development of acute respiratory emergencies associated with sports and athletics. EIB is a common feature of asthma and is characterized by a postexercise fall in FEV1 of more than 10 per cent. Although a variety of medications have been used for the prevention of EIB, cromolyn sodium and inhaled adrenergic agonists have been shown to be the most effective. EIA and cholinergic urticaria are two physical allergies in which hypotension can be brought on by exercise. In some individuals, EIA develops only in association with the ingestion of a particular food. Associated with sports and recreational activities in alpine areas is the risk of developing acute high-altitude medical problems. One of the most dramatic and potentially life threatening is high-altitude pulmonary edema. The management of this condition can be problematic, particularly if rapid descent to lower elevations is not possible. Although rare, spontaneous pneumothorax and pulmonary emboli do develop in the otherwise well-conditioned athlete. These entities must be considered when the physician evaluates any athlete in whom acute cough and dyspnea develop."

Signs of RVD and elevated natriuretic peptides like NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin (TnT) are associated with increased risk of mortality. However, the prognostic role of both initial diagnostic strategy and the use of NT-proBNP and TnT for screening for long-term probability of RVD remains unknown.

Postoperative atrial fibrillation lengthened his ICU stay. On postoperative day 6, it was noted that the platelet count, which had begun to rise from a postoperative nadir of 105,000, had fallen again to 90,000. The cardiologist indicated suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT); he stopped all heparin and ordered a heparin antibody test. Platelets were 98,000 the next day when the cardiologist wrote, ""I am considering calling Hematology, but they would likely anticoagulate the patient; his stool guaiac is positive, so I will hold off consultation."" The next morning, the patient had a pulseless, cool, and cyanotic right arm. On arrival, the hematologist found the patient confused, with a tender abdomen and absent bowel sounds. In spite of initiation of a direct thrombin inhibitor, the patient expired of bowel necrosis and sepsis within a few days. CASE 2: A 42-year-old physician with episodic supraventricular tachycardia had an outpatient ablation procedure. Two weeks later he presented with a swollen painful leg, with Doppler showing complete thrombotic occlusion of the common femoral, popliteal, and superficial femoral veins. Platelet count was 165,000 before procedure, 111,000 on representation, and 66,000 after intravenous heparin infusion was started. Shortness of breath and documented pulmonary embolus ensued. When a heparin antibody test ordered 5 days after admission came back very strongly positive, a direct thrombin inhibitor was begun. The patient demanded transfer to our hospital. His subsequent course was benign, including transition to warfarin and discontinuation of anticoagulants after 6 months."
CD010864,0,23465871,0,Decreasing D-dimer after recent negative computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram does not rule out pulmonary embolism.,"An algorithmic approach to testing utilizing risk stratification and quantitative D-dimer has been considered an acceptable approach to ruling out pulmonary embolism (PE). When D-dimer is elevated, further testing for PE is indicated. However, no evidence exists to guide practitioners when patients return after a recent negative workup for PE who previously had an elevated D-dimer. This case describes a patient who initially had an elevated D-dimer with negative workup for PE who, on repeat visit, had a decreasing D-dimer but was diagnosed with a PE. When evaluating patients after a negative workup for PE after an elevated D-dimer, a decrease in D-dimer cannot be used to rule out PE."

The British Thoracic Society PE guidelines state that PE is reliably excluded in patients with low-intermediate clinical probability and a negative D-dimer. We are reporting the case of a 47-year-old lady, taking tranexamic acid for menorrhagia, who presented with shortness of breath and was diagnosed with extensive bilateral PE. She had a low clinical risk of PE as determined by her Wells score, and a subsequent negative D-dimer. This patient's D-dimer value of 15 ng/ml (HemosIL DD HS assay) was the lowest associated with any CT pulmonary angiogram (n=1645) recorded at our trust over a 2-year period. This lady was successfully treated with a heparin infusion and warfarin. No further thromboembolic events had occurred by 18-month follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe tranexamic acid causing an extremely low false-negative D-dimer masking PE."

We examined the anti-viral effects of the derivatives on human influenza A virus infection by ELISA/virus-binding, hemagglutination inhibition, hemolysis inhibition and neutralization assays. The sialyl PE derivatives that we examined bound to A/Aichi/2/68, A/Singapore/1/57 and A/Memphis/1/71 strains of H3N2 subtype, but not to A/PR/8/34 strain of H1N1 subtype. The derivatives inhibited viral hemagglutination and hemolysis of human erythrocytes with A/Aichi/2/68 and A/Singapore/1/57 (H3N2), but not with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The inhibitory activity of the (Neu5Ac)2-PE derivative was the strongest of all sialyl PE derivatives (IC50, 35 microM to 40 microM). Sialyl PE derivatives also inhibited the infection of A/Aichi/2/68 in MDCK cells. Complete inhibition was observed at a concentration between 0.3 to 1.3 mM. IC50 of (Neu5Ac)2-PE was 15 microM in A/Aichi/2/68 strain. Taken together, the synthetic sialyl PE derivatives may be effective reagents against infection of some types of influenza A viruses."
CD010864,0,16608008,0,[Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism].,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common disease that poses a major diagnostic challenge because symptoms and signs are neither sensitive nor specific. However, patients with suspected PE can be classified into low, moderate and high clinical probability groups on the basis of symptoms and signs of PE, the presence of risk factors and the presence or absence of a likely alternative diagnosis. Stratification of patients into groups according to the clinical or pretest probability is imperative for proper selection of further diagnostic tests. The role of D-dimer testing is limited to the ruling out of PE in patients with low or moderate clinical probability. Conversely D-dimer testing is useless in patients, with high clinical probability. Chest CT has become an attractive means for an accurate diagnosis of PE and may replace lung scanning as first-line imaging test in particular in patients with underlying pulmonary disease or abnormal chest radiograph. Initial treatment for patients with non massive PE consists of therapeutic anti-coagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and early overlapping with oral anticoagulants. In patients with active cancer, long-term treatment with LMWH is recommended. Duration of anticoagulant treatment is based on the balance between the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (depending mainly on the reversibility of risk factor, the presence of cancer, thrombophilia or previous venous thromboembolic episodes) and the risk of bleeding."

CD010864,0,12871404,0,Accuracy of D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio to predict pulmonary embolism: a prospective diagnostic study.,"D-Dimer and fibrinogen are elevated in many diseases presenting signs and symptoms similar to those seen in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). We tested the hypothesis that patients with PE have lower fibrinogen and higher d-dimer values than patients in whom the diagnosis is suspected but safely excluded. One hundred and ninety-one consecutive patients with suspected acute PE (85 positive, 106 negative) were investigated with a diagnostic strategy including d-dimer, pretest probability, and helical computed tomography as first-line tests. In 38 of 40 patients with suspected PE and d-dimer <500 microg L(-1), PE was excluded without further testing. During a 3-month follow-up, there was no clinical PE among these 38 and the 68 patients with a negative helical CT. In 151 patients with d-dimer >500 microg L(-1), d-dimer, fibrinogen, and d-dimer/fibrinogen ratio (D/F ratio) were different in PE-positive compared with PE-negative patients [medians (and ranges) for d-dimer: 3793 (780 - 42 195) vs. 992 (621-6957) microg L(-1), fibrinogen: 3.8 (0.4-6.2) vs. 4.7 (2.2-8.4) g L(-1), and D/F ratio: 1.22 (0.15-85.45) 103 vs. 0.25 (0.09-1.03) x 103; P < 0.0001, respectively). The true positive rate was almost twice as high using D/F ratio >1.04 x 103 (49 of 85 patients; 57.6%) compared with d-dimer >7000 micro g L(-1) (25 of 85 patients; 29.4%). Patients with acute PE have lower fibrinogen values than patients with suspected but excluded PE. D/F ratio >103 is highly specific for the presence of acute PE, and causes a doubling of the diagnostic rate compared with d-dimer testing alone."

FDPs are determined by hemagglutination inhibition according to Merskey. They are found in the sera of the healthy in average values of 3.73 mkgr/ml. The highest average values in the first 24 h were found in case of pulmonary thrombembolia up to 106.64 mkgr/ml, followed by rheumatoid arthritis 26.3 mkgr/ml, myocardial infarction with complication 22.4 mkgr/ml, rheumatism +5.58 mkgr/ml, not-stabilized angina pectoris 5.5 mkgr/ml; and noncomplicated myocardial infarction 4.3 mkgr/ml. By the third day of the disease FDP in pulmonary thrombembolia decreased, whereas a negligible elevation was observed in case of non-complicated myocardial infarction. The results were interpreted as well as the cause for the presence of the mentioned products in those groups of diseases. FDP determination is recommended as a routine method in case of: diagnosis of pulmonary thrombembolia, differentiation of myocardial infarction with or without complications, differentiation of pulmonary thrombembolia from myocardial infarction in emergency states, progressing with chest pain, collapse phenomena, dyspnea and establishment of the activity of the process of rheumatoid arthritis.

Since 2004 when the guideline for treatment for perioperative PTE was established, the morbidity rate of perioperative PTE in Japan has decreased. However, the mortality rate has not changed. There are few medical staffs with an experience of PTE because perioperative PTE rarely happens. In addition, the symptoms of PTE are not specific. Therefore, all procedures from the initial diagnosis to the final treatment should be made easy to understand.

Thirty normal pregnant women served as controls. ELISA was employed for the detection. The results showed that the TAFI antigen levels in normal pregnancy group, gestational hypertension group and PE group were (85.35+/-24.69)%, (99.65+/-18.27)%, (110.12+/-23.36)%; (97.06+/-21.40)%, (114.08+/-27.76)%, (125.49+/-24.70)%; (106.6+/-19.21)%, (129.2+/-25.07)%, (139.1+/-30.12)%, in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester respectively. No significant differences were found between the normal pregnancy group and gestational hypertension group but significant difference existed between normal pregnancy group and PE group in each trimester (P<0.05). TAT complexes were significantly higher in patients with PE than that in controls (P<0.05), but no correlation was found between TAT and TAFI. It is concluded that TAFI may contributed to the impairment of fibrinolysis in the patients with PE and may serves as a sensitive indicator for PE, but it may not help in the diagnosis of the gestational hypertension."
CD010864,0,18028485,0,High D-dimer level is associated with increased 15-d and 3 months mortality through a more central localization of pulmonary emboli and serious comorbidity.,"High D-dimer levels are predictors of death in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), as are more proximally located, larger emboli. The direct link between these three has not yet been described. A cohort of 674 consecutive patients with confirmed PE was studied. Patients were followed up for 3 months. D-dimer levels were measured only in patients with an unlikely clinical probability (n = 262). The odds ratio (OR) for death of all variables was calculated. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for mortality. The best predictive D-dimer cut-off point for mortality was a concentration >3000 ng/ml FEU (OR 7.29). High D-dimer levels were correlated with active malignancy and age over 65 years, both being indicators of 3-month mortality. High D-dimer levels were also correlated with centrally located pulmonary emboli and 15-d mortality. The combination of high D-dimer levels and central emboli increased early mortality risk by 2.2. High D-dimer levels in patients with an unlikely clinical probability were associated with fatal outcome after PE. Centrally located pulmonary emboli were associated with higher D-dimer levels and worse 15-d mortality. Active malignancy, being an inpatient at time of diagnosis and age over 65 years were associated with higher D-dimer levels and worse 3-month survival."

CD010864,0,12871396,0,Combined use of clinical assessment and d-dimer to improve the management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected deep vein thrombosis (the EDITED Study).,"Suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common problem facing emergency physicians. Timely diagnostic testing must be performed to accurately identify patients with DVT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a management strategy that combined consideration of clinical pretest probability and a d-dimer test to evaluate patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A prospective cohort study was performed in the emergency departments of four tertiary care institutions involving 1075 patients with suspected DVT. An emergency physician determined the pretest probability for DVT to be low, moderate, or high using an explicit clinical model. A blood sample was taken for d-dimer testing. Subsequent investigations (compression ultrasound, venography) were performed based upon the pretest probability and the d-dimer result. Patients considered at low pretest probability with negative d-dimer had no further diagnostic testing performed. All patients in whom the diagnosis of DVT was excluded by the algorithm did not receive anticoagulant therapy and were followed up for 90 days for the development of proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism. Overall, 195 (18.1%; 95% CI 15.9% to 20.6%) of 1075 patients were confirmed to have proximal DVT. Of the 882 patients who had proximal DVT excluded during the initial evaluation period using the algorithms, four (0.5%; 95% CI 0.1% to 1.2%) were subsequently diagnosed with proximal DVT in the follow-up period, including three patients in the low pretest probability group (1.0%; 95% CI 0.2% to 2.1%) who had normal d-dimer and no additional diagnostic testing performed. None of the 882 patients (0%: 95% CI 0% to 0.5%) developed pulmonary embolism in the follow-up period. A diagnostic strategy for the evaluation of patients with suspected DVT based on pretest probability and d-dimer is safe and feasible in the emergency department setting."
CD010864,0,23659393,0,Can the presence of significant coagulopathy be useful to exclude symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism?,"Thrombocytopenia or an abnormal coagulation profile is not rare in hospitalised patients who have symptoms consistent with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Theoretically, coagulopathy is more likely to occur in patients with pneumonia than acute PE. This study aimed to assess whether the presence of coagulopathy could be used to exclude acute PE in patients with symptoms and signs consistent with acute PE. In this study, a significant coagulopathy was defined as a platelet count <100Ã10(9)/l, an international normalised ratio >1.5, or activated partial thromboplastin time >50 seconds. Patients treated with systemic anticoagulants prior to computed tomography pulmonary angiography were excluded. Of the 986 consecutive patients who required computed tomography pulmonary angiography to exclude acute PE over a four-month period in five hospitals in Western Australia, acute PE was confirmed in 149 patients (15.1%). The incidence of coagulopathy was not significantly different between those with and without acute PE (4 vs 7%, respectively; P=0.161) and between those with and without pneumonia (8 vs 7%, respectively; P=0.505). Positive and negative likelihood ratios of coagulopathy in differentiating acute PE or pneumonia were both unsatisfactory. As a continuous predictor, platelet counts, international normalised ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time and plasma fibrinogen concentrations were also not useful in differentiating between acute PE and other pulmonary pathologies (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were all close to 0.5). In conclusion, the presence of significant acquired coagulopathy cannot be used to suggest pneumonia or exclude symptomatic acute PE when the prevalence or pre-test probability of acute PE is not low."

Experimental PE was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by infusing 25Â Î¼m microspheres (1.8Â million/100Â gÂ bodyÂ wt) in the jugular vein, producing moderate pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vascular resistance was estimated from the quotient of the right ventricular peak systolic pressure/cardiac output. Arterial plasma hemoglobin (ELISA), arginase activity (colorimetric assay) and l-arginine (high performance liquid chromatography) were determined. Arginase activity was inhibited by infusion of N-omega-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine (nor-NOHA, 400Â mg/kgÂ bodyÂ wt, i.v.). Values are meansÂ Â±Â s.e. Five hours of PE caused red blood cell hemolysis (15-fold increase in plasma hemoglobin) and release of arginase activity (2.7-fold increase). Plasma l-arginine concentration decreased significantly from 250Â Â±Â 20.6 to 118Â Â±Â 6.0Â Î¼mol/L (Control vs. PE) and estimated pulmonary vascular resistance increased 3-fold. Treatment with nor-NOHA prevented the depletion of plasma l-arginine (229Â Â±Â 15Â Î¼mol/L) and reduced the rise in pulmonary vascular resistance by 40%. In conclusion, experimental PE causes hemolysis, release of arginase activity, depletion of plasma l-arginine and increased estimated pulmonary vascular resistance. Inhibition of arginase activity preserves plasma l-arginine levels and improves estimated resistance, suggesting that the release of arginase during hemolysis contributes to the rise in estimated pulmonary resistance during experimental PE."

CD010864,0,21116969,0,Autophagy monitoring assay: qualitative analysis of MAP LC3-I to II conversion by immunoblot.,"Lysosomal dysfunction is a recognized toxic mechanism for xenobiotics, which can result in various pathological states. There is concern that nanoparticles, in particular, may cause lysosomal pathologies, since they are likely to accumulate within lysosomes. Dysregulation of the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway is an example of lysosomal dysfunction associated with exposure to some nanomaterials. Here, we present a method to monitor autophagy by measurement the autophagosome marker LC3-II, a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-conjugated form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-I (MAP LC3-I). As other conditions could potentially result in LC3-II expression, treatment-related changes in expression should be further evaluated by morphological assessment, using techniques such as electron microscopy, to confirm autophagosome involvement."
CD010864,0,19178701,0,COPD exacerbation: lost in translation.,"The introduction and acceptance of a standard definition for exacerbations of COPD can be helpful in prompt diagnosis and management of these events. The latest GOLD executive committee recognised this necessity and it has now included a definition of exacerbation in the guidelines for COPD which is an important step forward in the management of the disease. This definition is pragmatic and compromises the different approaches for exacerbation. However, the inclusion of the ""healthcare utilisation"" approach ("".. may warrant a change in regular medication"") in the definition may introduce in the diagnosis of exacerbation factors related to the access to health care services which may not be related to the underlying pathophysiological process which characterizes exacerbations. It should be also noted that the aetiology of COPD exacerbations has not yet been included in the current definition. In this respect, the definition does not acknowledge the fact that many patients with COPD may suffer from additional conditions (i.e. congestive cardiac failure or pulmonary embolism) that can masquerade as exacerbations but they should not be considered as causes of them. The authors therefore suggest that an inclusion of the etiologic factors of COPD exacerbations in the definition. Moreover, COPD exacerbations are characterized by increased airway and systemic inflammation and significant deterioration in lung function. These fundamental aspects should be accounted in diagnosis/definition of exacerbations. This could be done by the introduction of a ""laboratory"" marker in the diagnosis of these acute events. The authors acknowledge that the use of a test or a biomarker in the diagnosis of exacerbations meets certain difficulties related to performing lung function tests or to sampling during exacerbations. However, the introduction of a test that reflects airway or systemic inflammation in the diagnosis of exacerbations might be another step forward in the management of COPD."

CD010864,0,18277137,0,Correlated expression of D-dimer concentrations with thrombotic burden in acute pulmonary embolism.,"Thrombotic burden might have an influence upon the concentration of D-dimer in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Patients with small pulmonary embolisms may thus present with relatively low concentrations of D-dimer. The objective of this study was to assess the correlation of the concentrations of D-dimer with the pulmonary artery occlusion score (PAOS) in a cohort of patients with acute pulmonary embolism. We have presently studied the correlation between the concentrations of D-dimer and the PAOS in a group of 75 patients who presented to the Department of Emergency Medicine with a clinical picture suggestive for acute pulmonary embolism and whose pulmonary computerized tomography (CT) angiography was positive for pulmonary embolism. A significant (P < 0.001) correlation (r = 0.42) was noted between the concentration of D-dimer and the PAOS in this group of 75 patients with acute pulmonary embolism. We further divided the cohort into those patients who had a score below the median of 18 (n = 37) and those who had a score above the median (n = 38), the corresponding mean concentrations of D-dimer being 364 and 814 ng/ml, respectively, in contrast to a mean concentration of 285 ng/ml that was observed in the group of controls (n = 73). In addition, from the receiver-operated characteristic (ROC) curves that were produced for the purpose of differentiating between the presence or absence of pulmonary embolism, for those who had a low score it was not possible to differentiate between those who had or did not have a pulmonary embolism [area under the curve 0.595 as opposed to 0.835 (P < 0.001) for the group with the high score]. Patients with acute small pulmonary embolism might present with relatively low concentrations of D-dimer. These findings might have implications regarding the diagnostic yield of D-dimer in patients who are suspected of having an acute pulmonary embolism."

We describe the case of a 40-year-old male with unexplained severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a seven-day history of progressive shortness of breath, hemoptysis, chest discomfort and bilateral pedal edema. Electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and imaging studies showed changes consistent with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Further work-up showed positive anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant with negative features for lupus with negative primary thrombophilic studies as well. The patient was managed adequately with oral anticoagulation with improvement of his clinical status and referred to a tertiary care center to be screened for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

CD010864,0,19630824,0,Diagnostic management of clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism.,"Current diagnostic management of hemodynamically stable patients with clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) consists of the accurate and rapid distinction between the approximate 20-25% of patients who have acute PE and require anticoagulant treatment, and the overall majority of patients who do not have the disease in question. Clinical outcome studies have demonstrated that, using algorithms with sequential diagnostic tests, PE can be safely ruled out in patients with a clinical probability indicating PE to be unlikely and a normal D-dimer test result. This obviates the need for additional radiological imaging tests in 20-40% of patients. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the first line tool to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of PE in patients with a likely probability of PE or an elevated D-dimer blood concentration. While single-row-detector technology CTPA has a low sensitivity for PE and bilateral compression ultrasound (CUS) of the lower limbs is considered necessary to rule out PE, multi-row-detector CTPA is safe to exclude PE without the confirmatory use of CUS."
CD010864,0,1536954,0,High incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation during remission induction of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"We determined the incidence and complications of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) at presentation and during remission induction of previously untreated adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or de novo Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (PCALL) seen at Memorial Hospital between January 1, 1978 and December 31, 1989. DIC was diagnosed in the presence of (1) low fibrinogen (less than or equal to 160 mg/dL), (2) prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and falling fibrinogen, or (3) prolonged PT and positive fibrin split products (FSP). L-Asparaginase was not used during remission induction. Among adequately screened patients with ALL, DIC was detected in 7 of 58 (12%) before initiation of chemotherapy and in 35 of 45 (78%) during remission induction. DIC was not simply the result of infection because clinical and laboratory signs of infection were absent in 16 patients, whereas only 2 of the 22 febrile patients with DIC had positive cultures. Among the 38 patients with DIC at presentation or during remission induction, serious complications were seen in 13 in temporal association with DIC (pulmonary embolus in one, sagittal sinus thrombosis in three, and serious hemorrhage in nine) and were major factors in the deaths of three patients. Among the 10 patients with thorough screening but no evidence of DIC there was only one hemorrhage during the same time interval. In patients with PCALL, DIC was detected in 9% at presentation and in 80% during remission induction. We conclude that DIC is rare at presentation but common during remission induction of adult ALL and PCALL and may be associated with significant thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. We suggest daily screening for DIC during the first 14 days of remission induction. The treatment of DIC in ALL and PCALL should be a subject of future clinical studies."

CD010864,0,21636051,0,ACR Appropriateness Criteria(Â®) on suspected lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.,"Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common clinical concern, with an incidence that increases with advanced age. DVT typically begins below the knee but may extend proximally and result in pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism can occur in 50% to 60% of patients with untreated DVT and can be fatal. Although clinical examination and plasma d-dimer blood evaluation can often predict the presence of DVT, imaging remains critical for the diagnostic confirmation and treatment planning of DVT. Patients with above-the-knee or proximal DVT have a high risk for pulmonary embolism and are recommended to receive anticoagulation therapy. On the other hand, patients with below-the-knee or distal DVT rarely experience pulmonary embolism, and anticoagulation therapy in these patients remains controversial. However, one sixth of patients with distal DVT may experience extension of their thrombus above the knee and therefore are recommended to undergo serial imaging assessment at 1 week to exclude proximal DVT extension if anticoagulation therapy is not initiated. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging method for evaluation of patients with newly suspected lower extremity DVT. Magnetic resonance and CT venography can be especially helpful for the evaluation of suspected DVT in the pelvis and thigh. Contrast x-ray venography, the historic gold standard for DVT assessment, is now less commonly performed and primarily reserved for patients with more complex presentations such as those with suspected recurrent acute DVT."
CD010864,0,1412163,0,Thrombolytic and pharmacokinetic properties of a recombinant chimeric plasminogen activator consisting of a fibrin fragment D-dimer specific humanized monoclonal antibody and a truncated single-chain urokinase.,"A recombinant chimeric plasminogen activator consisting of a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for cross-linked human fibrin (MA-15C5Hu) and a 32 kDa single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA-32k) comprising amino acids Leu144-Leu411, MA-15C5Hu/scu-PA-32k, was previously found to have a 12-fold higher fibrinolytic potency than recombinant scu-PA-32k towards a human plasma clot in a human plasma milieu in vitro (Vandamme et al., Eur J Biochem 1992; 205: 139-46). Therefore, the thrombolytic and pharmacokinetic properties of MA-15C5Hu/scu-PA-32k were compared with those of recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA) in 3 different venous thrombosis models in vivo. In hamsters with a pulmonary embolus consisting of a human plasma clot, the thrombolytic potency (% lysis per dose in mg/kg administered) of MA-15C5Hu/scu-PA-32k was 23-fold higher than that of scu-PA (p less than 0.0005). In rabbits with a jugular vein clot prepared from human plasma, the thrombolytic potency of MA-15C5Hu/scu-PA-32k was 11-fold higher than that of scu-PA (p = 0.012). In baboons with an autologous whole blood clot in the femoral vein, the chimera had a 5-fold higher thrombolytic potency than scu-PA. In all three animal species, the clearance of the chimera was 10- to 27-fold reduced as compared to scu-PA. The specific thrombolytic activity (% lysis per micrograms/ml steady-state plasma u-PA antigen) was increased up to 7-fold with MA-15C5Hu/scu-PA-32k as compared with scu-PA, which is indicative of targeting of the chimera to the clot. No fibrinogen breakdown or alpha 2-antiplasmin depletion was observed during thrombolysis with the chimera. Thus, MA-15C5Hu/scu-PA-32k constitutes a recombinant chimeric plasminogen activator with a significantly enhanced thrombolytic potency in 3 different animal models of venous thrombosis."

The diagnosis can be rejected in the context of low clinical suspicion and a negative D-dimer test. In all other situations the diagnostic accuracy of helical CT for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism compares favourably with pulmonary angiography, with regard to the occurrence of recurrent venous thromboembolism or fatal pulmonary embolism if anticoagulation is withheld in cases of negative findings. For final diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, pulmonary angiography is only necessary if CT-scan results are suboptimal or inconclusive. This new algorithm may increase the compliance in general practice of applying guideline recommendations in patients in whom thromboembolic disease is suspected. However the proposed clinical score must first be validated for use in general practice."

CD010864,0,2033902,0,[A case of congenital antithrombin II deficiency with pulmonary infarction].,"A 48-year-old woman was admitted because of increased bloody sputum. Since she had had a history of repeated thrombotic episodes including venous thrombosis in the lower limbs (21 year old) and pulmonary emboli developing into pulmonary infarction (41 years old), the patient was treated with anti-coagulant therapy using Warfarin for 7 years. Warfarin was discontinued after admission and heparin was administered instead at a relatively low dose of 5,000 units daily, resulting in a considerable diminution of hemoptysis. Unfortunately however, it caused a relapse of active thrombosis associated not only with a significant increase of the product of fibrinolysis (FDP), LDH and GOT but with a concomitant decrease of the platelet count. Hematological examinations concerning coagulation and fibrinolysis remained within a normal range except for the serum concentration of antithrombin III (AT III) and its functional property with regard to the heparin cofactor, which were 8.8 mg/dl and 48%, respectively. Since the findings were consistent with congenital deficiency of AT III, some members of her family were also examined. The concentration of AT III and its activity in the patient's son and her daughter deteriorated in a similar manner, indicating that this was a definite case of congenital deficiency of AT III. The clinical manifestations of 87 cases with congenital AT III deficiency, belonging to 24 families reported in Japan were reviewed."
CD010864,0,10629400,0,Modern strategy for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism.,"Various techniques are available for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), including pulmonary angiography, perfusion-ventilation lung scanning, D-dimer measurement, venous ultrasonography and, most recently, helical computerized tomography of the chest. The advantages and disadvantages of these techniques, used alone or in combination, are briefly discussed. Studies have indicated that treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), as well as being more convenient to administer, is as safe and effective as standard heparin therapy in acute PE. However, the efficacy and safety of LMWH in patients with acute PE and haemodynamic instability requires verification. Finally, the indications of inferior vena caval filters and thrombolytic therapy are outlined."
CD010864,0,133759,0,Fibrin subunits in venous and arterial thromboembolism.,"The subunit fibrin composition of thrombi of both venous and arterial origin was examined by sodium dodecyl sulphate gel electrophoresis. The thrombi were recovered by surgical intervention and all had the same fibrin subunit composition. The alpha chains were cross-linked as alpha-chain polymers alpha (p), the gamma chains as gamma-chain dimers (gamma-gamma) while the beta chains were not crosslinked; a further subunit of molecular weight 33 000 was shown to be present in all the fibrins examined and was a degradation fragment of the beta or gamma chains. This data suggests that the crosslinked alpha chains are rate limiting to the lysis of thrombi in vivo. The digestion of pulmonary emboli by plasmin yielded soluble degradation products which were identified as D dimer and E, the latter fragments being the major products obtained by the lysis of in-vitro made plasma clots. The similarity of the composition and lysis of thrombus fibrin to that formed in vitro augurs well for the justification of in-vitro research on mechanisms in thrombolysis."

The STA Liatest D-dimer and MDA D-dimer methods are based on the photo-optical measurement of the rate of agglutination of antibody-coated latex particles. The VIDAS D-dimer automated Elisa was used as the reference method. Diagnosis was confirmed in 51 patients (29 PE, 19 DVT, 3 DVT+PE). The immunoturbidimetric methods compared favorably with the VIDAS Elisa as judged from the correlation coefficients of linear regression lines (r = 0.82, MDA vs VIDAS; r = 0.75, STA vs VIDAS) and areas under the curve of ROC plots (VIDAS 0.83; STA 0.83; MDA 0.81). At a discriminant value of 500 ng/mL, all three D-dimer assays showed high sensitivity (96-98%), high NPV (93-97%) and moderate specificity (39-42%). Reproducibility of results around the cut-off is an important aspect of the diagnostic utility of D-dimer assays. CV's of duplicate determinations in this critical zone showed average values of 5.4% and 17.0% for MDA and STA, respectively. These data demonstrate that such rapid and automated latex-based methods for the quantitative measurement of D-dimer hold promise as reliable and cost-efficient approaches for the exclusion of VTE. Prospective patient management studies will be required to confirm this."
CD010864,0,12507759,0,The influence of repeated injections on pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of different types of sterically stabilized immunoliposomes.,"Sterically stabilized immunoliposomes (IL) with diameters of about 135 nm carrying mouse IgG, either coupled directly to the liposome surface, or linked to the terminal ends of grafted poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains by a recently described conjugation procedure (Cyanur-PEG-PE), were intravenously injected into rats and the elimination kinetics and biodistribution were determined and compared with control liposomes. The amounts of conjugated antibodies were about 30 microg/micromol total lipid for all IL. In naive rats, plain pegylated liposomes displayed the longest blood circulation time, whereas the terminal-coupled IL exhibited the fastest elimination. Liposomes containing the underivatized anchor molecules circulate nearly as long as plain pegylated liposomes, indicating that the fast elimination of the IL can be attributed to the presence of antibodies.A second injection of identical liposomes 14 days after the first injection had a considerable influence on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the liposomes. The circulation time of plain pegylated liposomes drastically dropped by half and their uptake by the liver increased concomitantly, indicating that the PEG, upon repeated injection, ceases to function as an efficient barrier reducing opsonization and/or immune reactions. The circulation time of conventional IL was moderately reduced upon a second injection, whereas that of the terminally coupled IL was nearly unaffected. These differences among the IL demonstrate that the pharmacokinetic behavior of IL is strongly dependent on the antibody conjugation site on the liposome. The observed effects of repeated injections were similar for liposomes of 90-nm diameter. The phenomena described may have important implications for the repeated application of IL as drug carriers."

PE affects about 3-8% of all pregnancies. In this study, we conducted liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to analyze serum samples depleted of the six most abundant proteins from normal and PE-affected pregnancies to profile serum proteins. A total of 237 proteins were confidently identified with <1% false discovery rate from the two groups of duplicate analysis. The expression levels of those identified proteins were compared semiquantitatively by spectral counting. To further validate the candidate proteins with a quantitative mass spectrometric method, selective reaction monitoring (SRM) and enzyme linked immune assay (ELISA) of serum samples collected from pregnant women with severe PE (n = 8) or normal pregnant women (n = 5) was conducted. Î±2- HS-glycoprotein (AHSG), retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) and Î±-1-microglobulin/bikunin (AMBP) and Insulin like growth factor binding protein, acid labile subunit (IGFBP-ALS) were confirmed to be differentially expressed in PE using SRM (P<0.05).

A total of 702 consecutive patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of PE underwent four-slice CT. Patients with negative findings received the determination of D-dimer. Those with positive D-dimer underwent further diagnostic workup to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of PE. Those with negative D-dimer were followed-up to 6 months to detect the development of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE). The CT test was interpreted as negative in 536 patients (76.3%). These patients had the D-dimer determination, which was positive in 279 and negative in the remaining 257 patients. Of the former, PE subsequently was documented in 55 patients (19.7%). Of the latter, symptomatic VTE in the follow-up period developed in three patients (1.17%; 95% confidence interval, 0.24 to 3.38%). In conclusion, when using the four-detector row, the negative predictive value of CT findings in patients with clinically suspected PE and positive D-dimer is low. In contrast, it is safe to withhold anticoagulation from patients with negative findings and negative D-dimer."

Our objective was to compare a novel enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that detects IgA antibody against tTG to two standard IFA methods utilizing thin tissue sections of rat kidney/rat stomach (KS) and distal primate esophagus (PE) as substrates to detect IgA antibody against endomysium (EMA). Sera from 100 patients suspected of having gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) and 23 sera possessing various antibodies used for EIA cross-reactivity studies were included. Additional tests, performed routinely in our laboratory, were utilized to further assess sera from patients suspected having GSE. These tests include anti-gliadin IgA antibody (AGA) and anti-reticulin IgA antibody (ARA) and are part of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN) revised criteria for diagnosing GSE. When compared to IFA using KS, the tTG EIA had a sensitivity of 87.5%, was 97.1% specific, and had an overall agreement of 94.0%. When compared to IFA using PE, the tTG EIA had a sensitivity of 92.6%, was 93.2% specific, and had an overall agreement of 93.0%. When the KS IFA was compared to the PE IFA for EMA, the KS IFA had a sensitivity of 96.3%, was 91.8% specific, and had an overall agreement of 93.0%. The majority of sera that were positive for tTG but were negative by IFA (KS, n = 2/PE, n = 5) possessed IgA antibodies against gliadin and/or reticulin. Five of six sera with negative results by PE IFA were positive by the KS IFA and possessed one or more antibodies to tTG and/or gliadin and/or reticulin. We conclude that the tTG EIA compares well to both KS and PE IFAs when detecting IgA antibody against endomysium. We do not recommend the use of PE to detect EMA primarily because of the inconsistencies (i.e., tissue selection, quality, and preparation) and limited availability of commercially prepared PE tissue."

Serum resistin, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), and uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) at 11 to 13 weeks were measured in 480 singleton pregnancies, including 240 with normal outcome, 60 that subsequently developed preeclampsia (PE), 60 that developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), 60 that delivered large for gestational age (LGA) neonates, and 60 that delivered small for gestational age (SGA) neonates. Each value in both the normal and pathological outcome groups was expressed as a multiple of the expected normal median (MoM), and the median MoM values in the outcome groups were compared. In the PE group, compared with the controls, there were an increase in median resistin (1.22 MoM, P = .003) and uterine artery PI (1.25 MoM, P < .0001) and a decrease in serum PAPP-A (0.72, P < .0001). There was no significant association between serum resistin with either uterine artery PI (P = .415) or serum PAPP-A (P = .290). In the SGA, LGA, and GDM groups, serum resistin MoM was not significantly different from that of the controls (P = .415, P = .702, and P = .549, respectively). In pregnancies that develop PE, maternal serum resistin concentration at 11 to 13 weeks is increased in a manner not related to altered placental perfusion or function. In pregnancies complicated by the development of GDM or delivery of SGA or LGA neonates, serum resistin is not significantly altered."

Most patients had antibodies against multiple antigens, but a few were positive for only anti-beta 2GP1 (12%) or anti-CL (3%). Positivity for anti-FVII/VIIa was significantly associated with positivity for anti-PE, anti-PS and/or anti-PC (P < 0.05) but not anti-beta 2GP1. When frequencies of immunoglobulin G (IgG) versus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were compared, anti-beta 2GP1 IgG correlated with the lupus anticoagulant (P < 0.05) and was significantly more prevalent than IgM, but the reverse was seen for all other antigens. In arterial thrombosis, IgM was more prevalent for all antigens, and was significantly associated with FVII/VIIa, PE and PS, whereas in venous thrombosis, IgG was frequently prevalent, especially in association with FVII/VIIa, beta 2GP1 and CL. In summary, FVII/VIIa is a new and common antigen in APS. Anti-FVII/VIIa is often associated with anti-PE, anti-PS and anti-PC. The IgM class is more frequently associated with arterial thrombosis and the IgG class with venous thrombosis."

Here, we report the relationship of IGF1 to GATA4, an essential transcription factor in cardiac hypertrophy and cell survival. In cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, we compared the responses to IGF1 (10 nmol/liter) and phenylephrine (PE, 20 Î¼mol/liter), a known GATA4 activator, in concentrations promoting a similar extent of hypertrophy. IGF1 and PE both increased nuclear accumulation of GATA4 and phosphorylation at Ser(105) (PE, 2.4-fold; IGF1, 1.8-fold; both, p < 0.05) and increased GATA4 DNA binding activity as indicated by ELISA and by chromatin IP of selected promoters. Although IGF1 and PE each activated GATA4 to the same degree, GATA4 knockdown by RNA interference only blocked hypertrophy by PE but not by IGF1. PE induction of a panel of GATA4 target genes (Nppa, Nppb, Tnni3, Myl1, and Acta1) was inhibited by GATA4 knockdown. In contrast, IGF1 regulated only Acta1 in a GATA4-dependent fashion. Consistent with the in vitro findings, Gata4 haploinsufficiency in mice did not alter cardiac structure, hyperdynamic function, or antifibrotic effects induced by myocardial overexpression of the IGF1 receptor. Our data indicate that GATA4 is activated by the IGF1 pathway, but although it is required for responses to pathological stimuli, it is not necessary for the effects of IGF1 on cardiac structure and function."

More particularly, the objective was to ascertain whether an increase in type II PLA2 tissue content and PLA2 enzymatic activity is associated with the previously documented stimulatory effect of LPS on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release from choriodecidua. Choriodecidua explants were incubated in RPMI 1640 (control) or RPMI 1640 containing LPS (0.1 ng/ml to 10 micrograms/ml) for up to 24 h. Under the incubation conditions utilized, LPS (1 microgram/ml) stimulated the release of PGE2 3-fold (p < 0.001, n = 4 tissues), in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.005). Tissue immunoreactive (ir)-type II PLA2 content and PLA2 enzymatic activity were determined by monoclonal antibody sandwich ELISA and radiolabeled enzyme assay procedures, respectively. The tissue content of type II PLA2 immunoreactivity in choriodecidua obtained from women (n = 7) at term but not in labor averaged 155 +/- 24 ng/ml DNA. PLA2 enzymatic activity average 29.8 +/- 5.1 pmol phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/mg DNA/h. LPS at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml increased immunoreactive type II PLA2 tissue content by 180% of the control value (p < 0.05, n = 7) within 1 h of exposure and remained significantly elevated for 18 h when compared to controls (174% of control, p < 0.01, n = 7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010864,0,8122612,0,Contribution of D-dimer plasma measurement and lower-limb venous ultrasound to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: a decision analysis model.,"The Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) study has shown that clinical evaluation and lung scanning may substantiate or exclude pulmonary embolism with reasonable probability in approximately half of the patients in whom it is suspected; for the remainder, pulmonary angiography is considered the gold standard diagnostic test. We performed a decision analysis to assess the potential of two noninvasive tests, D-dimer plasma measurement and lower-limb B-mode venous ultrasound, for reducing the number of pulmonary angiograms necessary to diagnose pulmonary embolism. Our decision model addresses hypothetical patients in the emergency ward with suspected pulmonary embolism and abnormal lung scan results. Results show that D-dimer measurements of less than 500 micrograms/L could be used reliably to exclude pulmonary embolism in patients with an abnormal but not high-probability (inconclusive) lung scan. D-dimer measurements of greater than 500 micrograms/L have no positive predictive value for pulmonary embolism and should be followed by ultrasound, which may replace pulmonary angiography when it discloses deep venous thrombosis. Pulmonary angiography should be performed when ultrasound is negative because of its presumably low sensitivity for deep venous thrombosis in patients with pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer measurement of less than 500 mu/L does not exclude pulmonary embolism in patients with a high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism. On the basis of the results of the PIOPED study, we calculated that the combination of D-dimer measurement and ultrasound might reduce the requirement for pulmonary angiography by one third among patients with inconclusive scan results and intermediate clinical probability of pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,10192506,0,[Anti-beta2 glycoprotein I-beta2 glycoprotein I] immune complexes in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and other autoimmune diseases.,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by the presence of aPL antibodies in patients with thromboembolic phenomena. Some antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies, such as those directed against beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI), are associated with thromboembolism, possess Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) activity and recognize their target antigen only when bound to specific surfaces or to phospholipids (PL). To ascertain whether both free and antibody-bound beta2GPI circulate in APS, we set up an ELISA to detect [IgG anti-beta2GPI-beta2GPI] immune complexes. In this system, rabbit anti-human beta2GPI antibodies were adsorbed onto plastic plates, incubated with patient plasma, and bound complexes were detected by means of alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-human IgG; each assay was stopped when positive controls consisting of in vitro generated immune complexes reached an Optical Density (OD) of 0.5 at 405 nm. Plasma from 16 patients with APS showed a mean OD405 of 0.291 (range 0.115-0.558), not statistically different from the mean obtained for 15 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (mean OD405 = 0.169, range 0.066-0.264). Surprisingly, levels of immune complexes in 14 patients with other autoimmune diseases and no circulating anti-beta2GPI antibodies were statistically higher (mean OD405 = 0.552, range 0.204-0.991) than those of healthy subjects and patients with APS. These data indicate that while autoantibodies to beta2GPI are mainly unbound in plasma of patients with APS, they are complexed with their antigen in patients with other autoimmune diseases, possibly reflecting a higher binding affinity."

Sera were collected at varying intervals postexposure (PE) and tested against M. flocculare and M. hyopneumoniae antigens in a semi-automated ELISA. Swine were killed six to 17 weeks PE and their lungs examined grossly for lesions and culturally for mycoplasmas. Pure cultures of M. flocculare were recovered from the lungs of 11 of 14 swine killed six to 12 weeks PE. Mycoplasmas were not isolated from the swine killed 15 to 17 weeks PE. Only one pig had gross lesions of pneumonia. Immunoassays revealed that swine were slow to seroconvert and titers (expressed in terms of optical density) were low. Three of 21 swine had antibodies to M. flocculare five weeks PE, five of 17 had seroconverted at seven to eight weeks and all surviving swine had antibodies to M. flocculare 76 days PE and beyond. Net optical density of positive sera was in the range of 0.201 to 0.412 (an optical density of 0.2 regarded as the breakpoint between negative and positive reactions in our ELISA). All of the sera were ELISA-negative when tested against M. hyopneumoniae antigen. This is regarded as a very significant finding. There has been concern that field sera might contain antibodies to M. flocculare and that such antibodies could render serodiagnostic tests for mycoplasmal pneumonia of swine nonspecific. Results of the present study suggest that swine infected with M. flocculare do not develop sufficient levels of antibodies to interfere with enzyme immunoassays for M. hyopneumoniae."

CD010864,0,19087851,0,[Usefulness of basic tests in patients with pulmonary embolism].,"There are common, specific noninvasive and invasive tests for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Arterial blood gases, lung radiography and electrocardiography belong to the first group and should be performed in patients with suspected PE. Among the second group, D-dimer determination is essential. Ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy was formerly the most frequently used test but has been relegated to a second-line position by the development of multislice computed tomography (CT) angiography, which provides the possibility of simultaneously studying the lower limbs to detect deep venous thrombosis (DVT). SPECT and magnetic resonance imaging can be used as an alternative to multislice CT angiography, but there is less experience with these techniques. Transthoracic echocardiography has, above all, predictive value and lower limb ultrasonography is the most common non-invasive method to detect DVT. Invasive tests, the gold standard, are often unavailable and their use is therefore limited to selected patients. In conclusion, noninvasive management (clinical probability, D-dimer and multislice CT) is feasible in most patients with suspected PE."
CD010864,0,19087852,0,[Follow-up of pulmonary thromboembolism].,"The aims of follow-up of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) are to avoid recurrence and possible sequels, such as pulmonary hypertension and postthrombotic syndrome of the lower limbs. Recurrences are reduced by anticoagulant therapy. In most PTE triggered by a transitory risk factor, without additional risk factors, the duration of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) is well established. However, in at least half of all cases, the triggering factors are not clear, the risk of recurrence is higher, and the duration of OAT has not been well-defined. Consequently, the factors that increase the risk of recurrence should be identified and monitored. These factors include cancer, some thrombophilias, and recurrent PTE or deep veinous thrombosis (DVT). In the last few years, idiopathic etiology, residual venous thrombosis, and other factors such as persistent right ventricular dysfunction, have also been demonstrated to be markers of recurrence. In some patients, D-dimers also seem to predict the risk of recurrence. Finally, the duration of OAT will be defined by periodically weighing the risk of recurrence against hemorrhagic risk in each individual patient. Current evidence on the balance of risks indicates a tendency toward indefinite anticoagulation, especially in idiopathic PTE. Moreover, functional monitoring through echocardiography, at least in the first 2 years, is essential to detect pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic pulmonary thromboembolism."
CD010864,0,18283526,0,Negative predictive value of D-dimer for diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.,"The D-dimer levels are considered to be useful for the diagnosis of thrombosis, and they can be clinically used as a negative predictive value (NPV). However, evidence for the efficacy of diagnosing thrombosis based on the D-dimer levels is still not well established. The present study was designed to evaluate the cut-off values of D-dimer levels as a negative predictor for thrombosis. The plasma concentrations of D-dimer were measured in inpatients suspected of having thrombosis, and then the findings were evaluated to assess the correlation with the diagnosis of thrombosis. In healthy volunteers, the median value of VIDAS-D-dimer was 0.12 microg/ml, and the 95% confidence interval was from 0.05 to 0.38 microg/ml. However, the plasma D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with thrombosis than in those without thrombosis; there was no significant difference in D-dimer levels among various thromboses such as pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The NPV for venous thromboembolism was 100% in patients with 0.5 microg/ml VIDAS-D-dimer and 1.2 microg/ml LPIA-D-dimer levels. Elevated D-dimer levels might indicate a high risk of thrombosis, especially DVT/PE, and they are thus considered to be useful as a negative predictor for thrombosis."

Autoantibodies to GAD are also found in patients with stiff man syndrome (SMS) or polyendocrine autoimmunity (PE). The epitope specificities of autoantibodies to GAD in IDDM and SMS have been well documented, but the locations of autoantibody epitopes of GAD in PE patients have not been mapped. Thus, the properties of anti-GAD antibodies in PE patients (with or without diabetes) were investigated. The ability of PE serum antibodies to inhibit the binding of the mouse monoclonal antibody, GAD-6, to native GAD in ELISA was determined. For PE patients without diabetes, levels of inhibition of GAD-6 binding ranged from 0% to almost 70% and were unrelated to the level of binding of serum antibodies to GAD (P = 0.351) or to the functional affinities of these antibodies. This suggests differences in the epitope specificities of anti-GAD antibodies in different patients. Levels of inhibition were also unrelated to clinical condition. SMS antibodies showed similar levels of inhibition of GAD-6 binding. Similar analysis was applied to PE patients with diabetes and levels of inhibition of GAD-6 binding to GAD were determined. These ranged from 0% to 80%, and levels of inhibition were similar in samples taken before or after diabetes onset. There was no significant difference between anti-GAD antibodies from PE patients with or without diabetes in the range of abilities to inhibit GAD-6 binding to GAD, although the highest levels of inhibition were given by sera from non-diabetic patients. This raises the possibility of differential expression of subsets of anti-GAD antibodies in progressive versus slow or non-progressive anti-islet autoimmune responses. Serum antibodies of PE and SMS patients did not inhibit the binding of antibodies specific for the extreme C-terminus of GAD, indicating that this is not the site of the epitopes for the patients' antibodies or for GAD-6."

AÎ²(pE3-42) is abundant in AD brain and has a high aggregation propensity, stability and cellular toxicity. The aim of the present work was to study the direct effect of elevated AÎ²(pE3-42) levels on ongoing AD pathology using transgenic mouse models. To this end, we generated a novel mouse model (TBA42) that produces AÎ²(pE3-42). TBA42 mice showed age-dependent behavioral deficits and AÎ²(pE3-42) accumulation. The AÎ² profile of an established AD mouse model, 5XFAD, was characterized using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Brains from 5XFAD mice demonstrated a heterogeneous mixture of full-length, N-terminal truncated, and modified AÎ² peptides: AÎ²(1-42), AÎ²(1-40), AÎ²(pE3-40), AÎ²(pE3-42), AÎ²(3-42), AÎ²(4-42), and AÎ²(5-42). 5XFAD and TBA42 mice were then crossed to generate transgenic FAD42 mice. At 6 months of age, FAD42 mice showed an aggravated behavioral phenotype compared with single transgenic 5XFAD or TBA42 mice. ELISA and plaque load measurements revealed that AÎ²(pE3) levels were elevated in FAD42 mice. No change in AÎ²(x)(-42) or other AÎ² isoforms was discovered by ELISA and mass spectrometry. These observations argue for a seeding effect of AÎ²(pE-42) in FAD42 mice."

Samples from 274 consecutive symptomatic patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (n=229; 79% outpatients, 21% inpatients), deep venous thrombosis (n=37; 84% outpatients, 16% inpatients) or suspected for both complications (n=8) were tested with this D-dimer assay with a Sysmex CA-1500 Coagulation Analyzer. Clinical probability for pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was staged according to a pretest risk score proposed by Wells. Final diagnosis of PE and/or DVT was established by spiral-computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries or compression ultrasonography, respectively. PE was diagnosed in 13.5% of the patients, whereas DVT was confirmed in 17.7% of the patients. The optimal cut-off value for exclusion of venous thromboembolism was 130 mug/l, and sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) were 95.0% (95% CI: 92.4-97.6), 30.4% (95% CI: 25.0-35.8) and 97.2% (95% CI: 95.2-99.2), respectively. In fact, two patient with PE were missed using D-Dimer PLUS; both cases were outpatients. In conclusion, this assay appears to be safe when implemented in an algorithm based on clinical assessment, D-dimer concentration, and radiological diagnostic techniques to stratify the risk for PE or DVT. However, higher sensitivities and negative predictive values were claimed in the scarce published reports for the D-Dimer PLUS assay than found in this study."

CD010864,0,15096318,0,"Epidemiology, etiology and diagnosis of venous thrombosis.","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the most frequent multifactorial diseases. It manifests clinically by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) leading to death in about 6%. It is important to emphasize, that 50% of the patients do not present any symptoms. The prevalence is influenced by age and ethnics. Both, hereditary (Factor V Leiden, G20210A prothrombin gene mutation, deficiencies of protein C, S or antithrombin) and acquired risk factors (estrogen replacement, cancer, cardiovascular disease, surgery, trauma, immobility, use of central venous catheters, autoimmune disease such as anti-phospholipid syndrome) contribute to VTE. The risk increases dramatically by the addition of hyperhomocysteinemia or the combination of several risk factors. Since VTE is a dynamic process able to manifest clinically or to resolve completely, the identification of persons at increased risk is mainly important for early diagnosis and treatment. The diagnostic strategy including clinical scores and laboratory tests (D-dimer measurement) as initial steps to confirm the suspicion of VTE may exclude patients who do not need further, sometimes invasive imaging tests (venography, compression ultrasonography combined or not combined with colour Doppler imaging, magnetic resonance imaging). Laboratory tests for suspected inherited thrombophilia should be performed six months after clinical presentation."

CD010864,0,17203959,0,Comparative proteome analysis of serum from acute pulmonary embolism rat model for biomarker discovery.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common, potentially fatal disease and its diagnosis is challenging because clinical signs and symptoms are nonspecific. In this study, to investigate protein alterations of a rat PE model, total serum proteins collected at different time points were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and identified using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Bioinformatics analysis of 24 differentially expressed proteins showed that 20 had corresponding protein candidates in the database. According to their properties and obvious alterations after PE, changes of serum concentrations of Hp, Fn, DBP, RBP, and TTR were selected to be reidentified by western blot analysis. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed DBP, RBP, and TTR to be down-regulated at mRNA levels in livers but not in lung tissues. The low serum concentrations of DBP, RBP, and TTR resulted in the up-regulation of 25(OH)D3, vitamin A, and FT4 (ligands of DBP, RBP, and TTR) after acute PE in rat models. The serum levels of Hp and Fn were detected in patients with DVT/PE and controls to explore their diagnostic prospects in acute PE because the mRNA levels of Hp and Fn were found to be up-regulated both in lung tissues and in livers after acute PE. Our data suggested that the concentration of serum Fn in controls was 79.42 +/- 31.57 microg/L, whereas that of PE/DVT patients was 554.43 +/- 136.18 microg/L (P < 0.001), and that the concentration of serum Hp in controls was 824.37 +/- 235.24 mg/L, whereas that of PE/DVT patients was 2063.48 +/- 425.38 mg/L (P < 0.001). The experimental PE rat model selected in this study was more similar to the clinical process than the other existing PE animal models, and the findings indicated instant changes of serum proteins within 48 h after acute PE. The exploration of these differentially expressed proteins or their combination with existent markers such as D-dimer may greatly improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of acute PE, but diagnostic tests are still needed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these markers and also the number of false positives and false negatives."

It was found that 13 of 13 patients with DIC, 17 of 17 patients with PE, and 10 of 12 patients with MI possessed a significantly elevated factor VIII-related antigen to factor VIII activity ratio (VIII-ratio). The VIII-ratio returned to normal in each of 2 patients with DIC and 1 paitent with PE after treatment with heparin, heparin and alpha-amino-caproic acid, and heparin and coumadin respectively. In contrast, the VIII-ratio was slightly elevated only in 1 of 15 patients with coronary artery insufficiency without MI. In in vitro studies, after treatment of plasma with thrombin or plasmin, factor VIII activity was lost, whereas the amount of factor VIII-related antigen remained the same or was even increased when measured by agarose quantitative immunoelectrophoresis. These observations have led us to conclude that an elevated VIII-ratio is a very sensitive indicator of intravascular coagulation."
CD010864,0,12411840,0,Is a lung perfusion scan obtained by using single photon emission computed tomography able to improve the radionuclide diagnosis of pulmonary embolism?,"Planar pulmonary scintigraphy is still regularly performed for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism (PE). However, only about 50-80% of cases can be resolved by this approach. This study evaluates the ability of tomographic acquisition (single photon emission computed tomography, SPECT) of the perfusion scan to improve the radionuclide diagnosis of PE. One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients with a suspicion of PE underwent planar and SPECT lung perfusion scans as well as planar ventilation scans. The final diagnosis was obtained by using an algorithm, including D-dimer measurement, leg ultrasonography, a V/Q scan and chest spiral computed tomography, as well as the patient outcome. A planar perfusion scan was considered positive for PE in the presence of one or more wedge shaped defect, while SPECT was considered positive with one or more wedge shaped defect with sharp borders, three-plane visualization, whatever the photopenia. A definite diagnosis was achieved in 70 patients. After exclusion of four 'non-diagnostic' SPECT images, the prevalence of PE was 23% (n =15). Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibilities were 91%/94% and 79%/88% for planar/SPECT images, respectively. The sensitivities for PE diagnosis were similar for planar and SPECT perfusion scans (80%), whereas SPECT had a higher specificity (96% vs 78%; P =0.01). SPECT correctly classified 8/9 intermediate and 31/32 low probability V/Q scans as negative. It is concluded that lung perfusion SPECT is readily performed and reproducible. A negative study eliminates the need for a combined V/Q study and most of the 'non-diagnostic' V/Q probabilities can be solved with a perfusion image obtained by using tomography."

We found statistically significant differences between two groups with respect to the partial oxygen pressure, the oxygen saturation, and the PAP, but there was no difference between the two groups with respect to the pretreatment ADMA, NO(3), or homocysteine levels. The vitamin B(12) levels were higher in group II. The NO(3) levels increased and the ADMA and vitamin B(12) levels decreased with treatment in both groups.

CD010864,0,16091094,0,Likelihood ratios increase diagnostic certainty in pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a difficult diagnosis to confirm. The choice of tests has led to a myriad of algorithms. Diagnostic uncertainty can be quantified by the application of the tests' likelihood ratios (LR). Positive and negative LR enable the conversion of a pretest to a post-test probability, given a positive and negative test result, respectively. Thus, a pretest probability of <17% and a negative D-dimer with a negative LR of 0.05 (sensitivity 98%, specificity 40%) lead to a post-test probability of PE of <1%. Ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scans with a normal, very low, low, intermediate and high probability result have an LR of 0, 0.125, 0.25, 1 and 17, respectively. Also, patients with a V/Q scan result other than normal or high probability still have a post-test probability of PE from 3 to 65%. Positive and negative computed tomography pulmonary angiograms (CTPA) have an LR of 8.6 and 0.06, respectively (sensitivity 95%, specificity 89%). Patients with a high pretest probability and negative CTPA again still have a post-test probability of more than 10%. However, as the post-test probability after one test becomes the pretest probability for the next, test results used cumulatively progressively narrow the gap to a final diagnosis. The post-test probability after a D-dimer, V/Q scan, CTPA, leg ultrasound or pulmonary angiography, alone or in any combination or in any order, can be calculated using their LR. Use of LR thus assists in the precise interpretation of test results, such as in complex algorithms for PE."
CD010864,0,22414673,0,[CTPA in suspected pulmonary embolism: diagnostic strategy].,"De Bruin and colleagues recently analysed the performance of the CTPA scan in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Their study shows that in a significant number of patients no abnormalities were found on a CTPA scan, a troubling finding given the radiation exposure. Young patients and ambulatory patients, in particular, often had a completely normal CTPA scan. Better stratification of patients with a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism is required, including evaluation of the value of clinical decision rules in ambulatory patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. In addition, the use of perfusion scanning, which involves significantly less radiation exposure, deserves further research in young people. Principally, a diagnostic strategy for pulmonary embolism comprising a clinical decision rule, followed by a D-dimer test if necessary, should be applied in clinical practice. This strategy will significantly reduce the number of CTPA scans showing no pulmonary embolism."

CD010864,0,10668382,0,[Massive pulmonary embolism--echocardiographic diagnosis and thrombolytic therapy].,"Thrombolysis is widely accepted as the treatment of choice for acute massive life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Several trials have shown that thrombolytic treatment has reduced morbidity and mortality in this condition, compared to heparin therapy. Rapid diagnosis and treatment start is mandatory for improving the prognosis. Clinical presentation, ECG, arterial blood gas analysis and D-dimer are non-specific tests. Additional tests like ventilation/perfusion lung scan, spiral-computed tomography or pulmonary angiography are needed. In an emergency situation a non-invasive and bedside technique is preferred, and several studies have demonstrated the accuracy of echocardiography in pulmonary embolism. Acute right ventricular overload is indicated by different echocardiographic findings. Three cases with the echocardiographic method as the initial technique for the diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolism are described as well as the treatment consequence and practical administration of thrombolysis. Our patients had presenting features suggestive of massive pulmonary embolism, a clinical situation where an echocardiographic evaluation is appropriate. All presented with typical echocardiographic features. Thrombolytic treatment was initiated immediately after echocardiographic diagnosis. Different thrombolytic regimens were used. Echocardiography may be used as the initial imaging technique for the diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolism. The advantages are obvious, and thrombolytic treatment can be initiated without delay."

CD010864,0,1442374,0,George W. Holmes Lecture. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: correlative evaluation and therapeutic implications.,"Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States; estimates range from 120,000 to 150,000 deaths annually. Although usually symptomatic, deep venous thrombosis can be clinically occult, in part due to incomplete obstruction or in part related to duplication, triplication, and fenestration anomalies, primarily of the superficial femoral or popliteal vein. Additionally, pulmonary emboli caused by deep venous thrombosis may be clinically silent. Because of therapeutic implications, especially indications for insertion of inferior vena caval filters, comprehensive assessments of both the disease process (i.e., deep venous thrombosis) and the complication (i.e., pulmonary emboli) are important. Thus, when a pulmonary embolus is the presenting process, correlative assessment of deep venous thrombosis, even in the absence of symptoms or signs in the lower extremity, may be of therapeutic significance. Conversely, when deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities involving the popliteal or superficial femoral vein is the presenting process, correlative assessment of the pulmonary circulation, even when no pulmonary symptoms or signs are present, may be of therapeutic significance. Relative to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, the roles of assays of D-dimer, ventilation-perfusion lung scans, and segmental occlusion studies of the pulmonary circulation are discussed. Finally, the indications for insertion of inferior vena caval filters above the renal veins are presented and examples are shown."
CD010864,0,23590655,0,Immunophenotyping of selected hematologic disorders--focus on lymphoproliferative disorders with more than one malignant cell population.,"Currently, clinical laboratories face increasing demand for flow cytometry testing combined with limited funding. Therefore, many laboratories search for panels that would provide sufficient immunophenotyping information and meet economical requirements. At the Flow Cytometry Laboratory, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada, we apply two 10-color tubes of surface markers for diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs). These tubes contain most of the mandatory B- and T-cell markers according to European Leukemia Net (www.leukemia-net.org) recommendations. The B-cell-oriented panel includes the following antibodies: Kappa-FITC/lambda-PE/CD19-ECD/CD38-PC5.5/CD20-PC7/CD34-APC/CD23 APC-AF700/CD10 APC-AF750/CD5-PB/CD45-KO. A different combination is applied to detect cytoplasmic Ig light chain expression and aberrant immunophenotype of plasma cells. The T-cell panel allows enumeration of various T- and NK-cell subsets: CD57-FITC/CD11c-PE/CD8-ECD/CD3-PC5.5/CD2-PC7/CD56-APC/CD7-APC-AF700/CD4-APC-AF750/CD5-PB/CD45-KO. The reported overall incidence of B-cell chronic LPDs presenting with more than one aberrant population is approximately 5%. Multicolor analysis facilitates the detection of multiple aberrant populations in the same sample because expression of multiple antigens can be studied simultaneously in each defined population. Examples of LPDs with multiple aberrant populations are presented."

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the influence of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) on the cytokine response in a modified in vitro model. UHMW-PE particles (psi < 7.5 microm) were suspended in soluble collagen type I and subsequently solidified in different concentrations (105,106 and 107 particles per well) on the bottom of the wells. Human bone marrow cells in a concentration of 3 x 106 cells per well were seeded on the collagen-particle substrata and maintained for up to 12 days. The cytokine response (IL-1_, IL-6 and TNF-_) of the cells to the particles were examined by ELISA compared to cells on control collagen surfaces without any particles. Assays for viability using LDH activity were done immediately. Light and scanning microscopic evaluation revealed that the UHMWPE particles, which have built large conglomerates (psi7.5_m), were mainly surrounded by the cells and less phagocytosed. The results of the cytokine release revealed significant differences in interleukin (IL)6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- _ and IL-1beta. The cell viability was not affected by the UHMW-PE particles. The results demonstrate that the particle induced cytokine response by UHMW-PE is mainly by the release of Interleukin 6 and TNF- _. Moreover the results confirm that the present method is useful to evaluate the in vitro effects of UHMW-PE wear particles with direct particle cell contact."

In this report, we have used Coulter volume to determine the mean cell volume and diameter of normal human peripheral blood cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained by apheresis (HPC-A) from patients with hematological malignancies. Fresh peripheral blood samples (treated with Beckman Coulter IMMUNOPrep erythrocyte lysis solution), HPC-A samples (treated with BD Biosciences FACSLysing solution), or processed by Ficoll Hypaque sedimentation method were stained with CD45-FITC and PE-labeled CD34, CD90, CD117, and CD133 antibodies and analyzed for electronic volume and two color fluorescence. The mean electronic volume and diameter of mononuclear cells from fresh peripheral blood samples prepared with IMMUNOPrep were lymphocytes (191 microm(3), 7.16 microm), monocytes (370 microm(3), 9.91 microm), and granulocytes (328 microm(3), 8.56 microm). In mononuclear cells of HPC-A samples prepared by Histopaque-1077 sedimentation, the lymphocytes had volume and diameter of 311 microm(3), 8.4 microm, monocytes were 486 microm(3), 9.76 microm, and granulocytes were 515 microm(3), 9.95 microm. In contrast, HPC-A samples prepared after lysis with FACSLysing solution had mean electronic volume and diameter of lymphocytes (414 microm(3), 9.25 microm), monocytes (797 microm(3), 11.5 microm), and granulocytes (670 microm(3), 10.85 microm). Cell volume of mononuclear cells in the HPC-A samples prepared by Histopaque-1077 sedimentation method was correlated with the expression of stem cell markers CD34, CD90, CD117, and CD133. CD90 positive cells had the smallest mean electronic volume of 299.93 microm(3) when compared with cells with positive expression of CD133 (322 microm(3)), CD117 (349 microm(3)), CD34 (407 microm(3)), and CD45 (453 microm(3)). Correlation of cell volume with stem cell marker expression may allow for the identification of small stem cells, which may not express the conventional markers used for the identification of stem cells in HPC-A samples."
CD010864,0,16941402,0,[Diagnosis and therapy of pulmonary embolism].,"Management of venous thromboembolism has long been characterized by a high degree of complexity and a disappointing lack of both efficacy and efficiency. The non-specific clinical signs of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and the limitations of earlier imaging procedures such as the lung scan and pulmonary angiography led to the development of numerous sophisticated, multi-step diagnostic algorithms which, however, have proved extremely difficult to implement in clinical practice. As a result, the diagnosis of potentially life-threatening PE was frequently missed in many patients who subsequently died of the disease without receiving appropriate treatment, while other patients unnecessarily underwent a battery of invasive, time consuming procedures due to a vague, poorly documented clinical suspicion. Recently, the development of structured models for assessment of clinical pre-test probability, the widespread use of D-dimer testing in the outpatient setting, and particularly the technical advances of multidetector-row CT scan, had an enormous impact on our strategy for approaching patients with suspected PE. Contemporary diagnostic algorithms based on the above modalities are not only efficient and reliable but also simple and practicable. Furthermore, the importance of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, even in the absence of overt hemodynamic instability, was recognized, and a number of studies demonstrated the value of echocardiography and laboratory biomarkers for risk stratification of PE. At present, low molecular weight heparins are increasingly becoming established as the treatment of choice for hemodynamically stable patients without RV dysfunction (non-massive PE), while consensus exists that patients with massive PE and cardiogenic shock necessitate emergency removal of pulmonary thrombus using thrombolytic agents, surgical embolectomy, or catheter-based thrombus aspiration. On the other hand, the treatment of stable patients with RV dysfunction (submassive PE) remains the subject of debate, and a large randomized trial is urgently needed to address the possible clinical benefits of thrombolysis in this setting."

In 363 consecutive outpatients CRP and D-dimer test were performed and clinical probability of PE was assessed. Patients with D-dimer levels<500 microg/l and clinical probability indicating 'PE unlikely' were followed for 3 months. Ventilation-perfusion scan or spiral computerized tomography was performed in patients with D-dimer levels>or=500 microg/l or clinical probability indicating 'PE likely'. The CRP had a sensitivity of 95.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 90-100] and negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.4% (96-100). CRP<5 mg/l with clinical probability score indicating 'PE unlikely' (n=108, 30%), had a sensitivity of 96.7% (90-100), a specificity of 43.0% (37-49) and NPV of 99.1% (97-100). D-dimer<500 microg/l with clinical probability score indicating 'PE unlikely' (n=170, 51%), had a sensitivity of 96.7% (90-100), a specificity of 67.9% (62-74) and NPV of 99.4% (98-100). Based on retrospective data it was concluded that a standard CRP test can potentially be used to safely exclude PE, either as a sole test or combined with clinical probability assessment.

The study aim was to assess in the real-world setting the use of the once-daily 1.5 mg reduced dosage regimen of fondaparinux available for this context. In this prospective cohort study, patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 20-50 ml/minute, undergoing total hip (THR) or knee (TKR) replacement or hip fracture surgery (HFS) received fondaparinux thromboprophylaxis. Main clinical outcomes were bleeding (major/clinically relevant non-major), symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and death.

CD010864,0,11286983,0,"p-Nitrophenylcarbonyl-PEG-PE-liposomes: fast and simple attachment of specific ligands, including monoclonal antibodies, to distal ends of PEG chains via p-nitrophenylcarbonyl groups.","We have attempted to simplify the procedure for coupling various ligands to distal ends of liposome-grafted polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains and to make it applicable for single-step binding of a large variety of a primary amino group-containing substances, including proteins and small molecules. With this in mind, we have introduced a new amphiphilic PEG derivative, p-nitrophenylcarbonyl-PEG-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (pNP-PEG-DOPE), synthesized by reaction of DOPE with excess of bis(p-nitrophenylcarbonyl)-PEG in a chloroform/triethylamine mixture. pNP-PEG-DOPE readily incorporates into liposomes via its PE residue, and easily binds primary amino group-containing ligands via its water-exposed pNP groups, forming stable and non-toxic urethane (carbamate) bonds. The reaction between the pNP group and the ligand amino group proceeds easily and quantitatively at pH around 8.0, and remaining free pNP groups are promptly eliminated by spontaneous hydrolysis. Therefore, pNP-PEG-DOPE could serve as a very convenient tool for protein attachment to the distal ends of liposome-grafted PEG chains. To investigate the applicability of the suggested protocol for the preparation of long-circulating targeted liposomes, we have coupled several proteins, such as concanavalin A (ConA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), avidin, monoclonal antimyosin antibody 2G4 (mon2G4), and monoclonal antinucleosome antibody 2C5 (mon2C5) to PEG-liposomes via terminal pNP groups and studied whether the specific activity of these immobilized proteins is preserved. The method permits the binding of several dozens protein molecules per single 200 nm liposome. All bound proteins completely preserve their specific activity. Lectin-liposomes are agglutinated by the appropriate polyvalent substrates (mannan for ConA-liposomes and glycophorin for WGA-liposomes); avidin-liposomes specifically bind with biotin-agarose; antibody-liposomes demonstrate high specific binding to the substrate monolayer both in the direct binding assay and in ELISA. A comparison of the suggested method with the method of direct membrane incorporation was made. The effect of the concentration of liposome-grafted PEG on the preservation of specific protein activity in different coupling protocols was also investigated. It was also shown that pNP-PEG-DOPE-liposomes with and without attached ligands demonstrate increased stability in mouse serum."

A total of 49 patients (72%) were positive for aPL antibodies of different isotypes and directed to one or more PL epitopes. Prevalence of IgG anticardiolipin (aCL, 37%) was similar to that of the other negatively charged PLs phosphatidylserine (PS, 35%), phosphatidylinositol (PI, 35%), phosphatidylglycerol (PG, 35%) and phosphatidic acid (PA, 40%); prevalence reduced to 9-12% and 7-16% respectively for IgM and IgA isotypes to the same antigens. aPL antibodies to the zwitterionic PLs phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were also observed, though their prevalence was lower than that demonstrated for negatively charged PLs.

During a mean follow-up period of 30 months, 10 patients had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with a total of 21 events. By chi 2 test, a significant correlation was found between DVT and IgG aCL (p = 0.03) and between this event and the presence of lupus anticoagulant (LA) antibody (p = 0.04). However, stronger correlations were demonstrated between DVT and IgA aCL (p = 0.007), IgG anti-PS (p = 0.02), and IgA anti-PC, -PI and -PG (p = 0.02, 0.003 and 0.02, respectively), whereas no correlation was found between thrombotic events and aPL antibodies with PE and PA specificities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010864,0,21176247,0,[Exclusion of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism using clinical decision rules and D-dimer tests].,"Clinical diagnosis of a venous thromboembolism (VTE) is often difficult because the symptoms of this disorder are diverse and unspecified.

Various D-dimer tests are available that differ with regard to sensitivity, specificity and duration of the measurement.

This study suggests that the leg movement and calf compression associated with the modified airline seat (NewSit) may decrease the probability of DVT due to prolonged periods of sitting by reducing venous stasis as measured by APG. Further studies involving a larger randomized patient cohort, as well as analysis of the effect of this modification on specific coagulation markers such as tissue plasminogen activator and fibrin D-dimer, are planned."

CD010864,0,19132208,0,Validity and clinical utility of the simplified Wells rule for assessing clinical probability for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism.,"The recently introduced simplified Wells rule for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) assigns only one point to the seven variables of the original Wells rule. This study was performed to independently validate the simplified Wells rule for the exclusion of PE. We retrospectively calculated the prevalence of PE in the ""unlikely"" probability categories of the original Wells (cut-off < or =4) and the simplified Wells rule (cut-off < or =1) in 922 consecutive patients with clinically suspected PE from a multicenter cohort study. We compared the three-month incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with an unlikely probability and a normal D-dimer test using both scores, and the proportion of patients with this combination (clinical utility). The proportion of patients categorized as PE ""unlikely"" was similar using the original (78%) and the simplified (70%) Wells rule. The prevalence of PE was 13% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11-16%) and 12% (95%CI, 9.7-15%) for the original Wells and simplified Wells ""unlikely"" categories, respectively. None of the patients with PE ""unlikely"" and a normal D-dimer test experienced VTE during three-month follow-up. The proportions of patients in whom further tests could safely be withheld based on PE ""unlikely"" and a normal D-dimer test was 28% (95%CI, 25-31%) using the original and 26% (95%CI, 24-29%) using the simplified Wells rule. In this external retrospective validation study, the simplified Wells rule appeared to be safe and clinically useful, although prospective validation remains necessary. Simplification of the Wells rule may enhance the applicability."

CD010864,0,15915417,0,Evaluation and management of the acutely dyspneic patient: the role of biomarkers.,"The etiology of dyspnea can often be difficult to rapidly and accurately determine and can delay timely and appropriate therapies. The current literature reveals important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications of several currently used biomarkers: sensitive d -dimer, myoglobin, creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponins, and b-type natriuretic peptide. These biomarkers were found to have a high sensitivity and negative predictive value for rapidly ruling out potential serious etiologies of dyspnea, namely, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and congestive heart failure (CHF). In the setting of a low to moderate pretest probability of PE, a negative sensitive d -dimer can rule out a PE with 97% accuracy. After 10 hours from the onset of symptoms, normal levels of myoglobin, creatine kinase-MB, and cardiac troponin I can rule out an AMI with greater than 96% accuracy. A b-type natriuretic peptide level less than 80 pg/mL can confidently rule out decompensated CHF with greater than 99% accuracy. However, no literature was found analyzing the use of these biomarkers in combination. A dyspnea biomarker panel could rapidly and accurately assist a clinician to rule out PE, AMI, and CHF. If a PE, AMI, or CHF is determined to be the cause of dyspnea, a biomarker panel could help risk stratify and help determine initial therapies. Subsequent clinical research is needed to corroborate this postulation."

Its cut-off is about 500 ng/ml FEU and this single test is completed within 10 min. D-dimer was measured in 301 patients suspected of pulmonary embolism by conventional microplate and membrane ELISA. For the latter, readings were made by eye and some differences were noticed between the readers for reactions in the grey zone. Sensitivity and negative predictive values were similar for the two ELISA (higher than 90%). The 95% confidence intervals of sensitivity and negative predictive values obtained with this membrane ELISA suggest that this new test may be used as a diagnostic tool to exclude the presence of pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,8215838,0,The application of a rapid D-dimer test in suspected pulmonary embolus.,"A prospective, consecutive series of plasma D-dimer (D-D) using a rapid, sensitive, and semiquantitative latex agglutination test from 169 patients clinically suspected of having acute pulmonary embolus (PE) was performed to determine its clinical utility in acute PE. All patients had ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans and 20 patients (12%) subsequently had pulmonary arteriography (PAG). The 20 patients who subsequently had PAG were used to establish the predictive value(s). In 10 patients with normal D-D results, none had PE according to PAG. In 10 patients with abnormal D-D results, seven showed PE by PAG and three did not show PE by PAG. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values of the plasma D-D tests for acute PE based on PAG were 1.00, 0.77, 0.70, and 1.00, respectively. In nine patients with indeterminate V/Q scans who had PAG, four had PE and the D-D result was abnormal. Five of these patients did not have PE and the D-D result was abnormal in three and normal in two. Seventeen patients had high-probability V/Q scans, all of whom had abnormal D-D results. Only one had PAG that showed PE in this group. A normal D-D result using a rapid latex agglutination method can effectively exclude the diagnosis of acute PE. The negative predictive value of the rapid latex agglutination method is as good as the more cumbersome enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. An abnormal result is nonspecific and is not useful in the diagnosis of acute PE. While some ""false positives"" did occur, there were no false-negative results. The best use of the D-D test is in the examination of the patient with indeterminate V/Q studies. We conclude that the D-D test can rapidly provide information in determining whether a patient needs further angiographic studies."

DIGE revealed the differential expression of clusterin levels and its isoforms in top6-depleted plasma of women who delivered an SGA infant but remained normotensive (SGA-NT; N = 8) compared to healthy women with an uncomplicated pregnancy outcome (Controls, N = 8). Immunosorbent enzyme-linked assay (ELISA) showed that compared to plasma clusterin levels from healthy controls [71.1 (SD 12.4) Âµg/mL, n = 39], clusterin was decreased in SGA-NT [58.3 (SD 11.7), N = 20, P < 0.0001], increased in women with SGA and PE [81.5 (SD 14.8), N = 20, P < 0.01], but similar in PE alone [71.2 (SD 9.4)g/ml, P = 1.0]. Screening for clusterin levels and/or its different isoformsmay be useful in mid-pregnancy to identify women who subsequently develop SGA but remain normotensive or who develop preeclampsia with SGA."
CD010864,0,23027483,0,Incidence of venous thromboembolism in fractures around and below the knee with physical prophylaxis.,"Fractures occurring at the distal part of the lower extremities are recognized to have a relatively lower risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE); however, few detailed reports exist on the subject. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of VTE in fractures around and below the knee. Overall, 109 consecutive patients with fractures around and below the knee who were surgically treated at the authors' hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Physical prophylaxis was performed in all patients. Until April 2009, VTE screening was performed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography or ultrasonography when the D-dimer value did not decline predictably, exceeded 20 Î¼g/mL 5 days after trauma and surgery, or increased above 20 Î¼g/mL after a period of decline. After April 2009, ultrasonography was routinely performed pre- and postoperatively irrespective of the D-dimer value. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on the absence or presence of accompanying injuries, including head, chest, abdominal, or spinal injury and other fractures of the pelvis and lower extremities. Overall, VTE and pulmonary thromboembolism were detected in 28 (25.7%) patients and 5 (4.6%) patients, respectively. All cases were asymptomatic. The VTE incidence rates were 8.6% (former screening) and 40% (newer screening) in patients with isolated fractures and 25% (former screening) and 41.7% (newer screening) in patients with accompanying injuries. The pulmonary thromboembolism incidence rates were 2.9% (former screening) and 0% (newer screening) in patients with isolated fractures and 3.2% (former screening) and 25.0% (newer screening) in patients with accompanying injuries. Surgeons should be vigilant for symptoms of VTE in patients with fractures occurring at the distal part of the lower extremities."

CD010864,0,19523433,0,Well-defined and potent liposomal hepatitis B vaccines adjuvanted with lipophilic MDP derivatives.,"The characterization of immunological cascades of the innate immune system activated by invariant molecular structures termed as pathogen-associated molecular patterns recognized by pattern recognition receptors of macrophages and dendritic cells, have allowed the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory properties of adjuvants. Thus, adjuvant-active lipophilic analogues of N-acetyl muramyl dipeptide (MDP) were incorporated in liposomal hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) formulations. The immunoreactivity of the formulations was evaluated by measuring anti-HBs, immunoglobulin G (IgG), and isotype antibody titer and compared with alum-adsorbed HBsAg formulation. The formulations were also evaluated for cell-mediated immune response by HBsAg-specific proliferation of splenocytes and simultaneous estimation of cytokines (interleukin-4 [IL-4], interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma]). Results indicate that the serum IgG and anti-HBs titer obtained after intramuscular administration of liposomal muramyl tripeptide-phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE) and liposomal N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine-glycerol dipalmitate (MDP-GDP) antigenic formulations were significantly higher. The incorporation of MTP-PE on the liposomal HBsAg increased the stimulation index (SI) four to five times as compared to plain HBsAg solution, and it also induced significantly higher Th1 cellular immune response with a predominant IFN-gamma level. So it is the novel effective and potentially safe approach in which liposomes act as delivery vehicles for hepatitis B viral antigen to antigen-presenting cells and is ornamented with a biological response modifier that could activate these target cells to enhance the antigen presentation to T lymphocytes."

CD010864,0,3610325,0,Pneumococcal antibody levels in patients with acute lung infiltrates.,"We assessed the diagnostic value of serial serum antibody titers (IgG, IgM) to a polyvalent pneumococcal antigen preparation containing capsular polysaccharides from 14 different serotypes in the differential diagnosis between infectious lung infiltrates and lung infarction. A two-fold or higher change in antibody level, measured by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was considered significant. Of 30 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, 13 were infected with a Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype included in the vaccine (group A), five with a non-vaccine type (group B), and in 12 patients the S. pneumoniae serotype was not identified (group C). The sensitivity was 62% (group A). A heterotypic antibody rise was observed in one patient (group B). There was no difference in antibody rises between groups A and C. In 13 patients the pulmonary infiltrates were associated with different etiological factors (group D). The specificity determined in this group was 85%. The positive predictive value of an antibody rise was 89% (SD = 0.07) in pneumococcal pneumonia and a negative result signified in only 46% of the patients (SD = 0.10) that the pulmonary infiltrates were not associated with pneumococcal infection. Four patients suffering from pulmonary infarction had no antibody rise. Preliminary data of a current similar study, using a 23-valent antigen of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides supported the aforementioned results. It is noteworthy that ten additional patients with lung infarction showed no seroconversion. The results suggest that serum antibody changes to a polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine may be of value in the differential diagnosis between infectious lung infiltrates and lung infarction."
CD010864,0,11016287,0,[Characteristics and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism.

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in 183 patients was confirmed based on the clinical and lung scan findings. Compared to previous studies fewer cases with pulmonary embolism after surgery, immobilisation and history of trauma to lower extremity were noted. Deep vein thrombosis and electrocardiographic signs of acute right ventricular strains were found frequently, and should support the suspicion of pulmonary embolism. A normal plasma fibrin D-dimer was noted in several patients. When using the D-dimer for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism the result given depends on the assay method used, the assay specific discriminatory level and duration of symptoms. The total one year mortality was 16% whereas the mortality due to pulmonary embolism was 6%."
CD010864,0,20186683,0,Alteration of pharmacokinetics of lepirudin caused by anti-lepirudin antibodies occurring after long-term subcutaneous treatment in a patient with recurrent VTE due to Behcets disease.,"The direct thrombin inhibitor lepirudin is mainly applied in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. We report here the case of a 37-year-old kurdish woman in whom Behcets disease was diagnosed in 1998 when she presented with a Budd Chiari syndrome (BCS) complicated by pulmonary embolism. Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurred despite anticoagulant therapy with UFH, LMWH or phenprocoumon and various immunosuppressive therapy regimens. In 2001, when BCS recurred ultimately i.v. lepirudin was administered. When the patient improved and remained clinically stable lepirudin was applied subcutaneously. During long-term treatment with twice-daily 50 mg no further VTE was observed over the following years. Additionally, no bleeding complications occurred. In May 2005 anticoagulant therapy was switched to phenprocoumon. BCS reoccurred when INR values were suboptimal in February 2007, and lepirudin treatment was immediately restarted. After admission the patient received 50 mg b.i.d. lepirudin s.c. with plasma levels in the therapeutic range (0.5-1.0 mg / l). Over the following months, lepirudin levels repeatedly exceeded the upper limit of this range and the dosage was stepwise reduced. Finally, 20 mg b.i.d. were sufficient to obtain therapeutic levels. Renal function was normal, but lepirudin antibodies were present in high titer, as assessed by ELISA. We suppose that these antibodies reduce renal filtration of lepirudin thus leading to increased plasma levels. This case is an example for successful long-term therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with s.c. lepirudin in a patient with Behcets disease and recurrent VTE despite therapeutic anticoagulant therapy with LMWH or vitamin K antagonists. However, frequent measurement of lepirudin plasma levels is needed. If stepwise dose lowering is required over time, the presence of lepirudin antibodies should be considered."

CD010864,0,8823622,0,Immune response to 17 beta-estradiol in polyelectrolyte complex: antigen specificity and affinity of hybridoma clones.,"Complex formation between synthetic polyelectrolytes (PE) [poly-4-vinyl-N-ethyl (cetyl), pyridine bromides-PVP(R2, R16)], bovine serum albumin (BSA), or 17 beta-estradiol-BSA conjugate (BSA.E) was studied in neutral water. Weakly water-soluble (colloidal) complex was formed upon addition of BSA.E to PVP (R2, R16) solution at pH 7. A nonrandom distribution of the protein molecules between the coils of polycations and self-assembly in the nonstochiometric polycomplex particles took place. The immunogenic properties of PVP (R2, R16)-BSA.E polycomplex were investigated and the specificities of produced antibodies analyzed. 17 beta-Estradiol introduced in polyelectrolyte complexes (PE-BSA) was found to invoke considerable increases in the steroid-specific immunoresponse. However, a comparative study of immunogenic activity of polycomplexes versus BSA.E+incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) mixtures revealed some differences in regards to the specificity of antibody production. In contrast to IFA+BSA.E systems, polycomplexes were able to generate estradiol-as well as BSA-specific antibodies. Such a carrier-directed response may be determined by increase in immunogenicity of weak antigenic determinants and/or by the exposure of internally located determinants upon complex formation with polyelectrolytes. Fusions following the two different immunization procedures resulted in the growth of comparable numbers of estradiol-specific monoclonal antibodies with apparently similar antigen affinities. Thus, immunizations using antigens in PEC appear to provide an efficient alternative to IFA."
CD010864,0,11926847,0,Plasma D-dimers in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.,"Clinical suspicion for venous thromboembolism (VTE) mandates objective testing to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. However, current imaging modalities are imperfect because of a small but important risk of complications with invasive techniques or limited sensitivity with noninvasive ones. A diagnostic tool for VTE is needed that is noninvasive and highly accurate, allowing immediate treatment decisions to be made in most cases. Plasma D-dimers (D-ds), specific cross-linked fibrin derivatives, partially fulfill these criteria in that they are sensitive markers for thrombosis but lack specificity. They therefore cannot be used to make a positive diagnosis of VTE; however, they generally have high negative predictive value and are useful as an exclusionary test, a potentially important role given that VTE is eventually ruled out in most patients investigated. Clinical management studies are clarifying the role of D-ds in the diagnostic paradigm of VTE: negative ultrasound and D-d findings obviate the need for serial imaging in suspected deep vein thrombosis, and anticoagulant therapy can be safely withheld in patients with non-high clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism and non-high probability ventilation perfusion scan if D-d test results are negative. More recently, the combination of a negative SimpliRED (AGEN Biomedical Ltd, Brisbane, Australia) D-d result and low clinical suspicion derived using a formal scoring system has been shown to exclude deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to obviate the need for imaging. Several different D-d assays are now available, and clinicians should be aware of the performance characteristics of the test used before incorporation into diagnostic algorithms as these will differ between assays, and the results of clinical management studies cannot necessarily be safely extrapolated to assays other than those specifically evaluated. If alternative assays are to be substituted, these should consistently have been shown to possess equivalent or greater sensitivity."

The presence of aPA may predict recurrent events in certain victims of heart attack and stroke. Blood samples from 105 cardiac transplant recipients (81 men, 24 women) were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of IgG, IgM, and IgA aPA to phosphatidylserine (PS), cardiolipin (CL), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Patients' ages ranged from 17 to 70 years (mean 51 years). Collection times ranged from Day 1 to 9 years post transplant (mean 36 months). All patients received triple immunosuppressive therapy. We report our aPA ELISA results in multiples of the normal median (MoM) of the OD405 values calculated for 252 healthy individuals. A positive MoM is greater than the MoM that encompasses 95% of the controls; for example, above 3 MoM is considered positive for IgG anti-CL, IgA anti-PS, and CL. Above 4 MoM is positive for IgG anti-PS and PE and IgM anti-PS and CL. Thirty-nine patients had IgG anti-PS (range 4.1-14.8 MoM), 63 had IgG anti-CL (3.1-9.4 MoM), 7 had IgM anti-PS (4.1-12.1 MoM), 1 had IgM anti-CL (14 MoM), 47 had IgA anti-PS (3.1-13.1 MoM), and 58 had IgA anti-CL (3.1-11.5 MoM). In our patient population, the incidence of IgG and/or IgA aPA was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than IgM. Few patients showed specificity for either PS, CL, or PE, and many were positive with more than one antibody isotype. Because aPA were evaluated in these patients, we investigated pretransplant serum samples which are available from 79 of the 105 recipients, and found aPA in 52 of 79 (66%) patients before transplantation. Longitudinal studies were done in three patients: two had increasing IgA aPA, beginning on Days 13 and 26 post transplant, whereas the third patient showed an increased aPA on Day 8 but a decrease on Day 23. Studies are in progress to determine whether a correlation exists between the presence of aPA, immunocytochemical (biopsy) findings, and clinical outcome."

CD010864,0,9624154,0,Cationic liposomes coated with polyethylene glycol as carriers for oligonucleotides.,"Modification of liposome surface with polyethylene glycol was used to improve oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) loading, stability of the resulting complexes, and specificity of cellular delivery of ODN by cationic liposomes. Liposomes composed of a cationic lipid (DOTAP, DOGS, DDAB), a neutral lipid (DOPE), and a phospholipid derivative of polyethylene glycol (PEG-PE) formed a complex with 18-mer phosphorothioate up to ODN/lipid molar ratio of 0.25. The complexes showed intact vesicular structures similar to original liposomes and their size (100-130 nm) was unchanged after several weeks of storage, whereas complexes lacking PEG-PE showed progressive aggregation and/or precipitation. After exposure to human plasma, PEG-modified cationic liposomes retained over 60% of the originally bound ODN. PEG-coated complexes resulted in 4-13-fold enhancement of the ODN uptake by human breast cancer cells in serum-supplemented growth medium, relative to free ODN. Complexes containing conjugated anti-HER2 F(ab') fragments at the distal termini of PEG chains efficiently delivered ODN primarily into the cytoplasm and nuclei of HER2 overexpressing cancer cells and greatly enhanced the biological activity of antisense ODN. The development of PEG-modified cationic liposomes may lead to improved ODN potency in vivo."

We evaluated the effect of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in a canine cadaver lung transplant model. Donor dogs were killed by the intravenous administration of pancuronium bromide without heparinization, and left for 2 h at room temperature. The donor lungs were then flushed with low potassium dextran glucose (LPDG) solution, being subjected to a total ischemic time of 3 h. Following left lung transplantation, the contralateral pulmonary artery of the recipient dogs was ligated. In group 1 (n = 6), chloride solution was administered from the main pulmonary artery for 90 min, commencing 15 min prior to reperfusion. In group 2 (n = 6), 2.5 microg/kg per min of rt-PA, and in group 3 (n = 6), 5.0 microg/kg per min of rt-PA, were continuously infused in the same manner as in group 1. Lung function, including arterial blood gases and pulmonary hemodynamics, was measured for 3 h. The side effects of rt-PA were evaluated by measuring the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, alpha2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha2-PI), plasminogen, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product (FDP). All of the animals in the three groups survived throughout the observation period. The group 3 animals had significantly better gas exchange than the group 1 animals, and the pulmonary hemodynamics were significantly better in the group 2 and 3 animals than in the group 1 animals. The FDP levels in the group 2 and 3 animals were significantly higher than those in the group 1 animals, while the PT and APTT were significantly prolonged in the group 3 animals. These findings led us to conclude that rt-PA improves early lung function, particularly pulmonary hemodynamics."

CD010864,0,21308491,0,Heterogeneity of human monocytes: an optimized four-color flow cytometry protocol for analysis of monocyte subsets.,"Monocytes are central mediators in the development of atherosclerotic plaques. They circulate in blood and eventually migrate into tissue including the vessel wall where they give rise to macrophages and dendritic cells. The existence of monocyte subsets with distinct roles in homeostasis and inflammation suggests specialization of function. These subsets are identified based on expression of the CD14 and CD16 markers. Routinely applicable protocols remain elusive, however. Here, we present an optimized four-color flow cytometry protocol for analysis of human blood monocyte subsets using a specific PE-Cy5-conjugated monoclonal antibody (mAb) to HLA-DR, a PE-Cy7-conjugated mAb to CD14, a FITC-conjugated mAb to CD16, and PE-conjugated mAbs to additional markers relevant to monocyte function. Classical CD14(+)CD16(-) monocytes (here termed ""Mo1"" subset) expressed high CCR2, CD36, CD64, and CD62L, but low CX(3)CR1, whereas ""nonclassical"" CD14(lo)CD16(+) monocytes (Mo3) essentially showed the inverse expression pattern. CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes (Mo2) expressed high HLA-DR, CD36, and CD64. In patients with stable coronary artery disease (nâ=â13), classical monocytes were decreased, whereas ""nonclassical"" monocytes were increased 90% compared with healthy subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries (nâ=â14). Classical monocytes from CAD patients expressed higher CX(3)CR1 and CCR2 than controls. Thus, stable CAD is associated with expansion of the nonclassical monocyte subset and increased expression of inflammatory markers on monocytes. Flow cytometric analysis of monocyte subsets and marker expression may provide valuable information on vascular inflammation.

CD010864,0,16601844,0,Clinical usefulness of D-dimer testing in cancer patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"Limited data are available about the diagnostic value of D-dimer testing in cancer patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Therefore, we evaluated i) the safety and clinical usefulness of an ELISA D-dimer test to rule out PE in cancer patients compared with non-cancer patients and ii) whether adopting a higher D-dimer cut-off value might increase the usefulness of D-dimer in cancer patients. We analysed data from two outcome studies which enrolled 1,721 consecutive patients presenting in the emergency department with clinically suspected PE. Presence of an active malignancy was abstracted from the database. All patients underwent a sequential diagnostic work-up including an ELISA D-dimer test and a 3-month followup. Sensitivity and predictive value (NPV) were 100% in both cancer and non-cancer patients. PE was ruled out by a negative D-dimer test in 494/1,554 (32%) patients without cancer, and in 18/164 (11%) patients with a malignancy. At cut-off values varying from 500 to 900 microg/l, the sensitivity was unchanged (100%, 95% CI: 93% to 100%) and the specificity increased from 16% (95% CI: 11% to 24%) to 30% (95% CI: 22% to 39%). The 3-month thromboembolic risk was 0% (95% CI: 0% to 18%) in cancer patients with a negative D-dimer test. ELISA D-dimer appears safe to rule out pulmonary embolism in cancer patients but it is negative in only one of ten patients at the usual cut-off value. Increasing the cut-off value of D-dimer in cancer patients might increase the test's clinical usefulness."
CD010864,0,23451766,0,Lipidomics of familial longevity.,"Middle-aged offspring of nonagenarians, as compared to their spouses (controls), show a favorable lipid metabolism marked by larger LDL particle size in men and lower total triglyceride levels in women. To investigate which specific lipids associate with familial longevity, we explore the plasma lipidome by measuring 128 lipid species using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in 1526 offspring of nonagenarians (59 years Â± 6.6) and 675 (59 years Â± 7.4) controls from the Leiden Longevity Study. In men, no significant differences were observed between offspring and controls. In women, however, 19 lipid species associated with familial longevity. Female offspring showed higher levels of ether phosphocholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) species (3.5-8.7%) and lower levels of phosphoethanolamine PE (38:6) and long-chain triglycerides (TG) (9.4-12.4%). The association with familial longevity of two ether PC and four SM species was independent of total triglyceride levels. In addition, the longevity-associated lipid profile was characterized by a higher ratio of monounsaturated (MUFA) over polyunsaturated (PUFA) lipid species, suggesting that female offspring have a plasma lipidome less prone to oxidative stress. Ether PC and SM species were identified as novel longevity markers in females, independent of total triglycerides levels. Several longevity-associated lipids correlated with a lower risk of hypertension and diabetes in the Leiden Longevity Study cohort. This sex-specific lipid signature marks familial longevity and may suggest a plasma lipidome with a better antioxidant capacity, lower lipid peroxidation and inflammatory precursors, and an efficient beta-oxidation function."

CD010864,0,2173634,0,Plasma thrombomodulin in health and diseases.,"Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis of plasma thrombomodulin concentrate revealed that four degraded forms of thrombomodulin with different molecular weights are present in plasma. Plasma concentrations of thrombomodulin in patients with various diseases were measured by two methods of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal antibodies. One method measures intact thrombomodulin and degraded forms of thrombomodulin; the other does not detect the two smaller degraded forms of thrombomodulin present in plasma. The results indicated that thrombomodulin was increased in the circulating blood of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome, pulmonary thromboembolism, adult respiratory distress syndrome, chronic renal failure, or acute hepatic failure. The different values obtained by the two methods indicate that the increase of plasma thrombomodulin found in these patients was mainly due to an increase of the smaller fragments of degraded forms, suggesting that the release of thrombomodulin from endothelial cells was accelerated in various disease states by proteolytic activity generated on the surface of the endothelium and may be removed from the circulation mostly by the kidneys and liver."

We used a modified Lim-Blaisdell model of PME to cause a severe ischemic soft tissue injury in dogs. The appearance of microaggregates (MA) in the venous circulation was measured using a laser optical scanning technique. The effect of MA on pulmonary physiologic and histologic parameters was measured and compared to control animals. In the ischemic soft tissue injury group, following restoration of local circulation, the platelet count dropped by 72% (P less than 0.00002), the number of MA increased by 800% (P less than 0.00002), the mean pulmonary artery pressure (PA) increased from 15.6 to 32 mm Hg (P less than 0.00002), and electron micrographs of lung obtained at 4 hr after ischemic insult revealed PM with severe lung injury that was consistent with a capillary membrane leak. The control group never demonstrated a significant change in platelets, MA, PA, or histologic lung injury. These findings imply that MA found in the pulmonary microcirculation are temporally related to the development of physiologic and anatomic lung abnormalities."

The highest IgG and IgM binding was to the anionic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidic acid (PA) and cardiolipin (CL), but excluding phosphatidylinositol (PI) to which only low antibody levels were found. Comparison of the mean IgG and IgM aPLA showed a trend for anti-PA > CL > PS > PC > PE > PI. Anti-PI levels were compared in two groups of African children, one group with non-severe and the other with severe (cerebral) falciparum malaria. Children with cerebral disease had significantly lower IgM anti-PI. The results are discussed with the view that serum-derived aPLA may have a role in 'anti-disease' immune responses. Their possible role in the opsonization and phagocytosis of parasitized erythrocytes and in thrombocytopenia is also considered."

However, accurate and timely diagnosis of VTE is confounded by its kaleidoscopic presentation. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) and D-dimer testing have both been increasingly employed to clarify the complex decision making required in such cases. Formal clinical pretest probability now serves as the root of algorithms for the diagnosis of DVT and PE. A low pretest probability of VTE plus a negative D dimer can be combined in a bayesian fashion to effectively exclude the diagnosis of VTE. The evidence for this strategy is strongest in younger outpatients with no associated comorbidities, no prior history of VTE, and a short duration of symptoms."

Global tests were sensitive for DIC but not for pre-DIC. However, hemostatic molecular markers such as soluble fibrin were sensitive for both DIC and pre-DIC. Hemostatic molecular markers were also useful for analysis of DIC in a baboon DIC model.

CD010864,0,1702764,0,Analysis of Pseudomonas exotoxin activation and conformational changes by using monoclonal antibodies as probes.,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) is a protein toxin composed of three structural domains. In its native form, the toxin is a 66,000-Mr proenzyme that must be activated to express full ADP-ribosylating activity. To study the process of activation and accompanying conformational changes, we have isolated 10 monoclonal antibodies to a 40,000-Mr fragment of the toxin (PE40) that exhibits full enzyme activity but lacks the toxin's cell-binding domain and contains amino acids 253 to 613 (comprising domains II, Ib, and III). By using mutant PE molecules in which all of domain I and portions of domains II, Ib, and III were deleted, the locations of the epitopes for each of the antibodies were determined. Eight of these monoclonal antibodies were further characterized. Of these eight, all reacted with soluble PE40 and an interleukin-2-PE40 conjugate, but only two reacted strongly with native soluble PE. However, all eight reacted with PE after it had been immobilized on nitrocellulose or after it had been activated to express full ADP-ribosylating activity. Antibodies were also assessed for their ability to neutralize the cytotoxic activity of either PE or interleukin-2-PE40. These antibodies should be useful as probes for monitoring the activation and processing of PE that occur during endocytosis and in determining the location of epitopes that are important for toxin activity."

The cut-off value for the quantitative tests was 500 ng/ml and Instant IA was interpreted by three readers. Pulmonary embolism was confirmed by lung scan or angiography in 60 patients (42%). The sensitivities of ELISA and STA-Liatest DDi were 92% [95% confidence interval (CI) 82-97%] and 93% (95% CI 84-98%), respectively. The three readings of Instant IA D-dimer disagreed in 27 (19%) of the patients and sensitivity varied from 83 to 93% according to the readers. In the 115 patients with concordant readings, sensitivity was 92% (95% CI 82-98%). These results suggest that STA Liatest DDi may be used instead of microplate ELISA for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism, whereas the use of Instant IA D-dimer for this purpose is limited by the number of discordant results."

Neither lupus anticoagulant nor anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in her plasma. After three months of total remission, she developed a severe pulmonary thromboembolism for which no specific biological cause was found. Her plasma was analysed for different antiphospholipid antibodies: lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were again negative. Using an ELISA prepared with either five different anionic phospholipids or zwitterionic phosphatidylethanolamine, solely an anti-phosphatidylethanolamine IgG was discovered in her plasma. In lupus patients, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is now well recognized as a high risk factor for repeated thrombosis and/or recurrent abortions. This case suggests that the presence of antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibody should be investigated in cases of unexplained thrombosis in SLE, where the usual clinical and biological investigations have failed to shed light."

The level of IgG was measured by Elisa in 30 patients with tuberculous pleuritis and 48 control subjects with pleural effusion (24 with carcinoma, 10 with transudative pleural effusion, 11 with empyema or parapneumonic effusion, 1 with pulmonary embolism and 2 due to systemic lupus erythematosus). The median titers of IgG against A60 of both serum and pleural fluid from tuberculous patients [445.6 +/- 133.56 and 263 +/- 72.58 Elisa units (EU) respectively] were significantly higher than those of corresponding median values (97.3 +/- 8.35 and 41.3 +/- 4.93 EU) of the control group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively). Considering 240 units as cutoff point for a positive test in serum, the sensitivity was 53.3% and the specificity 100%. In the pleural fluid the cutoff point value was established at 150 units, with a sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 100%. We concluded that Elisa using A60 is a reliable and rapid test with an acceptable sensitivity and magnificent specificity."

The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of APAs in women who have had at least 12 embryos transferred during several in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles without ensuing pregnancy. Sera from 42 women with IVF failure and 42 women who successfully conceived after IVF were tested for the presence of APAs by ELISA. Successful post-IVF pregnancy was determined by obtaining two consecutive rising beta-hCG levels followed by an ultrasound to confirm a viable conceptus. The sera were tested for three isotypes of antibody: IgA, IgG, and IgM against seven phospholipids: cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic Acid (PA), phosphatidyl-glycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidyl-serine (PS). From the IVF failure group, 11/42 (26.2%) were positive for APAs. From the control group, 2/42 (4.8%) were found positive only for IgA against PE. The difference between IVF failure and successful IVF groups was significant (P = 0.01). These results suggest that antiphospholipid antibodies should be considered an important marker for increased risk of IVF failure. Patients who are involved with an IVF program should be tested for the presence of APAs prior to initiation of an IVF cycle."

A computed tomography (CT) scan 10 months after surgery revealed enlargement of the mediastinal lymph nodes and a thrombus in the pulmonary artery. Although the patient was immediately given warfarin and heparin, the warfarin was discontinued due to liver dysfunction, and the thromboembolism in his pulmonary artery recurred. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation investigation of the surgical specimen revealed an EGFR point mutation at exon 21 (L858R). Gefitinib treatment was started and his levels of plasma D-dimer immediately decreased. The mediastinal lymph nodes shrank, and the thrombus in the pulmonary artery had disappeared on a CT scan 2 months after gefitinib treatment. Tumor regression was observed, and no recurrence of the pulmonary embolism was found 10 months after gefitinib treatment. Gefitinib was therefore a very effective treatment not only for lung cancer, but also for pulmonary embolism due to lung cancer."

CD010864,0,17875342,0,Antibodies elicited by a virosomally formulated Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen-5 derived peptide detect the processed 47 kDa fragment both in sporozoites and merozoites.,"Serine repeat antigen-5 (SERA5) is a candidate antigen for inclusion into a malaria subunit vaccine. During merozoite release and reinvasion the 120 kDa SERA5 precursor protein (P120) is processed, and a complex consisting of an N-terminal 47 kDa (P47) and a C-terminal 18kDa (P18) processing product associates with the surface of merozoites. This complex is thought to be involved in merozoite invasion of and/or egress from host erythrocytes. Here we describe the synthesis and immunogenic properties of virosomally formulated synthetic phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-peptide conjugates, incorporating amino acid sequence stretches from the N-terminus of Plasmodium falciparum SERA5. Choosing an appropriate sequence was crucial for the development of a peptide that elicited high titers of parasite cross-reactive antibodies in mice. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against the optimized peptide FB-23 incorporating amino acids 57-94 of SERA5 bound to both P120 and to P47. Western blotting analysis proved for the first time the presence of SERA5 P47 in sporozoites. In immunofluorescence assays, the mAbs stained SERA5 in all its predicted localizations. The virosomal formulation of peptide FB-23 is suitable for use in humans and represents a candidate component for a multi-valent malaria subunit vaccine targeting both sporozoites and blood stage parasites."
CD010864,0,17275019,0,Flow cytometry for basophil activation markers: the measurement of CD203c up-regulation is as reliable as CD63 expression in the diagnosis of cat allergy.,"The flow cytometric basophil activation test (BAT), based on the detection of allergen-induced CD63 expression, has been proved effective in the diagnosis of various IgE-mediated allergies. However, there is not yet consensus about the suitability of CD203c expression as a specific basophil activation marker and its diagnostic reliability. The goal of the present study was to compare measurement of CD63 and CD203c expression using BAT in a model of cat allergy and to determine optimal experimental conditions for both markers. Heparinized whole blood samples from 20 cat allergic patients and 19 controls were incubated with Fel d1 (relevant allergen) or anti-FcepsilonRI (positive control) either in IL-3 or IL-3-free conditions. An optimal gating of basophils was achieved in triple staining protocols: anti-IgE PE/anti-CD45 PerCP/anti-CD63 FITC or anti-IgE FITC/anti-CD45 PerCP/anti-CD203c PE. We demonstrated that IL-3 significantly enhanced CD63-induced expression by basophils obtained from cat allergic patients in response to Fel d1. Sensitivity was found to be 100%. The CD203c protocol, when performed under IL-3-free conditions, also demonstrated 100% sensitivity. Only one of the control subjects was positive in both tests. In conclusion, using well-defined experimental conditions, the measurement of CD203c up-regulation on basophils in response to specific allergens is as reliable as CD63-BAT for the in vitro diagnosis of patients with IgE-mediated allergy."

CD010864,0,11712858,0,Certain autoantibodies to phosphatidylethanolamine (aPE) recognize factor XI and prekallikrein independently or in addition to the kininogens.,"Recent evidence shows that many antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) to negatively-charged phospholipid (PL) do not target anionic PL per se, but are specific for anionic PL-binding plasma proteins, for example, beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)-GPI) and prothrombin. We also reported that certain antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies (aPE) are not specific for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) per se, but are directed to PE-binding plasma proteins, high molecular weight kininogen (HK), and low molecular weight kininogen (LK). Additional studies have shown that certain aPE failed to recognize purified kininogens but continued to produce aPE ELISA reactivity in the presence of semipurified HK preparations containing the HK binding proteins, factor XI (FXI) and prekallikrein (PK). We therefore investigated if certain of these aPE recognized FXI and/or PK. In this study we observed that aPE can recognize contact proteins FXI and PK independently or in combination with HK. Since contact proteins such as HK, PK and factor XII (FXII) have anti-coagulant and profibrinolytic functions, the pathophysiological role of aPE has yet to be elucidated. We propose that aPE of different specificities may initiate or promote characteristics pathological conditions in patients with thrombosis or recurrent pregnancy losses."

CD010864,0,17549296,0,Clinically suspected acute recurrent pulmonary embolism: a diagnostic challenge.,"It is unknown whether strategies validated for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) are valid in patients with a history of PE. It was the objective of this study to investigate whether a diagnostic algorithm consisting of sequential application of a clinical decision rule (CDR), a quantitative D-dimer test and computed tomography (CT) safely ruled out a clinical suspicion of acute recurrent PE. Data were obtained from a diagnostic outcome study of patients suspected of PE. Acute recurrent PE was ruled out by an unlikely probability of PE (CDR score </= 4 points) combined with a normal D-dimer test (</= 500 ng/ml) or by a normal CT in all other patients. The primary outcome was the incidence of acute recurrent venous thromboembolism during three months of follow-up in patients with normal tests and not treated with anticoagulants. Of 3,306 patients suspected of acute PE, 259 patients (7.8%) had a history of PE of whom 234 were not treated with anticoagulants. The probability of PE was unlikely in 82 of 234 patients (35%), and 42 had a normal D-dimer test (18%), excluding recurrent PE. None of these patients had a thrombotic event during follow-up (0%, 95%CI: 0-6.9). A CT was indicated in all other patients (192) and ruled out recurrent PE in 127 patients (54%). Only one patient with a negative CT had a fatal recurrent PE during follow-up (0.8%; 95%CI: 0.02-4.3). In conclusion, this prospective study demonstrates the safety of ruling out a clinical suspicion of acute recurrent PE by a simple diagnostic algorithm in patients with a history of PE."

Furthermore, association of Gas6 with markers of renal function, glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as inflammation, was assessed in all individuals. Median maternal Gas6 serum levels adjusted for body mass index and gestational age at blood sampling were significantly increased in PE patients (5.7 Î¼g/l) as compared to healthy, age-matched pregnant women (4.6 Î¼g/l) (p<0.05). Furthermore, Gas6 concentrations positively correlated with blood pressure, creatinine, free fatty acids, C-reactive protein, leptin, and adiponectin during pregnancy. Moreover, leptin and adiponectin remained independently associated with Gas6 levels in multivariate analysis. Gas6 serum levels 6 months after pregnancy were not significantly different between former PE and control patients. Taken together, maternal Gas6 serum concentrations are significantly increased in PE during pregnancy. Furthermore, the adipokines leptin and adiponectin are independent predictors of circulating Gas6 in pregnant women."
CD010864,0,17625694,0,The usefulness of adenosine deaminase in the diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity usefulness in the diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis (TP), comparing its value with pericardial effusions (PE) caused by other pericardial diseases. A retrospective case-control study was conducted with nine cases of TP and 39 other than TP diseases (12 neoplastic, 11 septic and 16 unknown origin). Every patient included in this study had PE samples submitted to ADA activity measures and microbiological analysis, and then had pericardial tissue samples submitted to microbiological and histopathological examination. Considering the value of 40 U/L as the cut-off for the diagnosis of TP, the specificity and sensitivity were respectively of 72% and 89%. The specificity of ADA activity for the TP was best applied in the differential diagnosis from PE of unknown origin. The present study demonstrates the clinical value of the measurement of ADA activity in PE in the diagnosis of TP."
CD010864,0,22858576,0,Diagnostic testing and the average absolute likelihood ratio: application to diagnosing wide QRS complex tachycardia and other ED diseases.,"The Bayesian approach to disease diagnosis in the emergency department is facilitated by the use of likelihood ratios (LRs) to evaluate diagnostic tests. The use of dichotomous, interval, and joint LRs for single and multiple tests is reviewed, and comparison is made to regression modeling. The clinical motivation for a single statistic to describe the average change in the odds of disease associated with the use of a particular test or series of tests is described. This new extension of the LR concept is termed the average absolute LR (AALR). Illustrative examples include the use of elevated electrocardiogram ST segment and troponin to diagnose acute myocardial infarction, and serum D-dimer and computed tomographic angiography to diagnose pulmonary embolism. Finally, a detailed example with original data demonstrating the use of the AALR to compare QRS duration, QRS axis, and the 2 tests combined to diagnose ventricular tachycardia in patients with stable sustained regular wide QRS tachycardia is provided. Application of both tests together to patients with wide QRS complex tachycardia changes the odds of ventricular tachycardia, on average, by a factor of 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.4-6.2). Challenges are described, and methods are provided to estimate the 95% confidence interval of the LR and AALR using bootstrapping techniques. The AALR is a test statistic that may be helpful for clinicians and researchers in evaluating and comparing diagnostic testing approaches."
CD010864,0,21212257,0,Measurement of dead space in subjects under general anesthesia using standard anesthesia equipment.,"Pulmonary dead space is the volume of gas that is delivered to the lungs but does not participate in gas exchange. Knowing pulmonary dead space in patients under general anesthesia is clinically useful because it can aid in detecting disease processes such as pulmonary emboli or low cardiac output states. Dead space can be simply calculated by using the Bohr equation; however, it is difficult to measure mixed exhaled carbon dioxide (PECO(2)) with a standard anesthesia machine. Previously, a study at our institution demonstrated the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentration in the bellows of a standard anesthesia machine is an accurate approximation of PECO(2). In this study, we used the bellows PECO(2) measurement and arterial CO(2) (PaCO(2)) to calculate pulmonary dead space. We verified the technique by adding known apparatus dead space volumes during anesthesia."
CD010864,0,18175241,0,A longitudinal study of angiogenic (placental growth factor) and anti-angiogenic (soluble endoglin and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1) factors in normal pregnancy and patients destined to develop preeclampsia and deliver a small for gestational age neonate.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that an imbalance between pro-angiogenic (i.e., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF)) and anti-angiogenic factors (i.e., soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1, also referred to as sFlt1)) is involved in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE). Endoglin is a protein that regulates the pro-angiogenic effects of transforming growth factor beta, and its soluble form has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of PE. The objective of this study was to determine if changes in maternal plasma concentration of these angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors differ prior to development of disease among patients with normal pregnancies and those destined to develop PE (preterm and term) or to deliver a small for gestational age (SGA) neonate."

CD010864,0,7426355,0,Fibrinogen degradation products in pleural effusions.,"This study investigates the diagnostic value of fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) in pleural fluid and serum. Thirty patients with pleural effusions due to a variety of causes were investigated. The concentration of FDP in pleural fluid was significantly higher in patients with malignancy, infection and pulmonary embolus than in patients with congestive cardiac failure. The concentration of FDP in serum was not significantly different between any of the groups. We conclude that estimation of the concentration of FDP in pleural fluid, a simple biochemical procedure, has some value in differential diagnosis of pleural effusion and complements existing tests."

The model was adapted to permit ageing of isolated experimental clots in vivo. A model of acute pulmonary embolism in this species is also described. In the venous thrombosis model, infusion of streptokinase (SK) or SK-activated human plasmin gave significant lysis but bolus doses of SK. plasmin complex were ineffective. Active site anisoylated derivatives of SK. plasminogen complex, SK-activated plasmin and activator-free plasmin were all active when given as bolus doses in both models. At lytic doses, the acyl-enzymes caused fewer side-effects attributable to plasminaemia than the corresponding unmodified enzymes."

At the index visit, patients were identified as being at high or low risk of PE; the former received full dosage low molecular weight heparin while the latter were left untreated until performance of diagnostic imaging (max 72 hours). During this period, no thromboembolic events occurred in low-risk patients (0/211, 0.% [upper 95% CI 0.9%]); only one event occurred in those at high-risk (1/125, 0.8% [upper 95% CI, 1.2]). Our study demonstrates that diagnostic imaging for PE can be safely deferred for up to 3 days."

CD010864,0,16902310,0,Pseudo-pulmonary embolism as a sign of acute heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in hemodialysis patients: safety of resuming heparin after disappearance of HIT antibodies.,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a syndrome caused by platelet-activating antibodies that recognize complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin. Thrombocytopenia is the most common clinical feature of HIT. HIT can be considered as a hypercoagulable state, with a high risk of thrombosis. Another feature of HIT is an acute systemic reaction that characteristically begins 5-30 min after receiving an intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin, such as is commonly given for hemodialysis (HD). Here we present 4 patients who developed acute HIT at or near the start of their chronic HD. All patients were anticoagulated with the low-molecular-weight heparin, nadroparin, for HD. Three of our patients underwent surgery approximately 1-2 weeks before developing HIT. All patients presented with an acute systemic reaction during HD. All patients were treated and further dialyzed with lepirudin. Under this treatment we observed a quick recovery of the platelet count, and patients remained symptom-free. Antibodies against the PF4-heparin complex were detected with a combination of a 'quick test' and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. The likelihood of having HIT previous to the detection of antibodies was estimated with the pre-test probability score criteria. The tests for PF4-heparin antibodies remained positive for an average of 165 days. Three patients underwent a rechallenge with nadroparin after disappearance of the HIT antibodies in their serum. All 3 remained symptomless when they were further hemodialyzed on nadroparin. Our observations indicate that nadroparin can be successfully reintroduced for HD anticoagulation once the patient's HIT antibodies have disappeared."

CD010864,0,12969548,0,Development of antibodies to feline IFN-gamma as tools to elucidate the cellular immune responses to FeLV.,"An understanding of the nature of immune protection and the role of immune effector products such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the control of infectious disease is fundamental to the rational design of effective vaccines and immunotherapeutic reagents. Murine monoclonal and sheep polyclonal antibodies (mAbs and pAbs) to feline IFN-gamma (fIFN-gamma) were generated firstly to facilitate further research into the role of cellular immune responses in the control of feline infectious disease, and secondly to enable evaluation of the efficacy of novel immunotherapeutic approaches. A hybridoma clone, D9, secreting IgG1 antibodies was selected for expansion and the mAbs affinity purified in vitro. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in a sheep against recombinant fIFN-gamma and affinity purified. The sensitivity of the D9 mAb and the sheep anti-fIFN-gamma pAb was determined using an indirect fIFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblots. These antibodies were assessed for their ability to detect the production of fIFN-gamma by specific feline T cell populations ex vivo following coculture with mitogen or feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigens for 4 h in the presence of the protein secretion inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA). Production of fIFN-gamma was evaluated using flow cytometry to simultaneously detect PE-labelled surface molecules and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled intracellular fIFN-gamma. Using this approach, our initial studies revealed an upregulation in virus-specific fIFN-gamma-secreting CD4(+)T cells in the lymph nodes of FeLV latently infected cats."
CD010864,0,19474701,0,Kinetics of D-dimer after general surgery.,"D-dimers may be elevated after surgery. However, the kinetics of postoperative D-dimers remains unknown hampering the use of D-dimer testing in surgical patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. D-dimer levels were prospectively measured in 154 patients after general surgery at predefined time points (kinetics were determined in an initial cohort of 108 patients; for validation, these findings were applied to a second cohort of 46 patients). Clinical factors influencing the peak of D-dimers were analyzed using multivariate regression. Surgical operations were stratified based on severity (type I: not entering abdominal cavity; type II: intraabdominal; type III: retroperitoneal/liver surgery). D-dimer levels increased postoperatively reaching a peak on day 7. After type I surgery, peak D-dimer levels did not exceed normal range (300 ng/ml, 100-500). After type II procedures, peak D-dimer level was 1500 ng/ml (200-7800) and returned to normal values after 25 days (+/-14). Peak level was 4000 ng/ml (500-14 400) after type III surgery normalizing within 38 days (+/-11). Clearance of D-dimer was exponential after having reached the peak with 6.0% per day (95% confidence interval 4.8-7.1%). By this clearance, D-dimer values could be adequately predicted in the validation cohort after day 7 (r2 = 0.63). Peak D-dimer levels were independently influenced by the type of surgery (P < 0.001), the operation time (P < 0.001) and by preoperatively elevated D-dimer levels (P < 0.001). Based on this data, duration of postoperative D-dimer elevation after abdominal surgery is predictable. This study indicates for the first time when D-dimers may be used again in the diagnostic algorithm for venous thromboembolism exclusion after surgery in patients with low or moderate clinical probability."
CD010864,0,14650950,0,Misdiagnosis of pulmonary embolism in patients with allergic reaction--the importance of prior probability of disease.,"Because pulmonary embolism (PE) and its treatment carry substantial risk of morbidity and mortality, accurate diagnosis is essential. We report two cases with allergic reactions, in which PE was suggested by routine ECG and D-dimer elevation and strengthened by spiral CT. Therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin was initiated and long-term anticoagulation was considered. As their histories did not reveal any predisposing factor to PE, the cases were re-evaluated. Elevation of D-dimer was now attributed to allergic reaction, ECG abnormalities were considered as constitutional, and findings from spiral CT attributed to breathing artifacts and partial-volume effects. The diagnosis of PE was therefore rejected and anticoagulant treatment discontinued without sequelae. These cases show the importance of determining clinical probability before ordering further diagnostic tests and critical interpretation of test results suggestive of PE, based on prior probability of the disease."
CD010864,0,11788689,0,Current strategies for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus.,"Venous thromboembolic disease (VTD), comprising venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus, is responsible for innumerable deaths every day. Wide variance in its presentation and clinical manifestations and the resultant difficulties in achieving its diagnosis have confounded attempts to define optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies. Those strategies should be predicated on the understanding of the manifestations of VTD and of the attributes and interrelationship of the various modalities available for its diagnosis. This review will present an overview of the literature describing those modalities, their strengths and deficiencies, and their current value in algorithms for the diagnosis of VTD."
CD010864,0,12922129,0,Induction of cross-protection against two wild-type Taiwanese isolates of Japanese encephalitis virus using Beijing-1 strain DNA vaccine.,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is an important human pathogen. Mouse brain-derived, inactivated JEV vaccines have contributed greatly to the reduction in numbers of JE patients in several countries, including Taiwan. However, mice immunized with the Nakayama strain inactivated vaccine show lower protection against a lethal strain of Beijing-1 JEV than those immunized with the homologous vaccine. DNA vaccine encoding the envelope (E) protein gene appears to provide protection against JEV in the mouse model, but it is not known whether such vaccines would confer cross-protection for mice against different strains of JEV. In this study, we evaluated the ability of pE, a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the Beijing-1 envelope protein to elicit cross-protective immunity against infection with the homologous Beijing-1 strain and two lethal Taiwanese isolates of JEV, CH2195 and CEN. Our results showed that mice immunized with pE were protected against lethal challenge with Beijing-1 JEV as well as two Taiwanese isolates. In addition, nai;ve mice were cross-protected by passive transfer of sera from immunized animals, indicating the crucial role of humoral immunity in protection. These results demonstrate that JEV DNA vaccine can provide effective protection against infection not only with homologous virus, but also with heterologous virus."

Since M. tuberculosis isolation rates in tuberculous effusions are relatively low the histological and microbiological studies of pleural biopsy samples are usually required to confirm the diagnosis. Several biological markers have been proposed to enhance the effectiveness of diagnosing patients with tuberculous pleurisy. The study was undertaken to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid IFN-gamma concentration in differentiation between tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) and non-tuberculous pleural effusion (nTPE)."

CD010864,0,10726284,0,Diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism: an update.,"Considerable progress has been made in pulmonary embolism diagnosis during the last ten years. New diagnostic instruments such as plasma D-dimer measurement and lower venous compression ultrasonography have been developed. Clinical evaluation of the likelihood of pulmonary embolism has been rehabilitated and proven accurate and valid. The interpretation of lung scan results has become more simple and clear to clinicians. Finally, two diagnostic strategies have been validated in large scale outcome studies. Both rely on a sequential combination of the above mentioned instruments and have been able to safely manage more than 90% of patients without a pulmonary angiogram. The 3-month venous thromboembolic risk in patients without pulmonary embolism and, hence, not anticoagulated was less than 1% in both studies. In the absence of a formal comparison of their respective cost-effectiveness, choosing between these strategies may rest on local preferences or logistics. Finally, spiral CT scan is highly promising and may considerably modify the diagnostic workup of pulmonary embolism in the near future. However, it is insufficiently validated and its position in a rational algorithm for diagnosing pulmonary embolism is not yet defined."
CD010864,0,15199464,0,Oral anticoagulant therapy in venous thromboembolism.,"The main objective of treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the prevention of the extension, embolization, and recurrence of thrombosis. The long-term aim is to prevent late recurrences and the post-thrombotic syndrome. Heparin and oral anticoagulants (OACs) have been the cornerstones of VTE treatment in the last 30 years. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have been introduced more recently in the treatment of the acute phase of VTE, and they have allowed the home treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in selected cases. The optimal duration of OAC therapy after VTE is still controversial. Several studies have been conducted, and several are ongoing with the aim to stratify patients into risk categories for recurrence. Patients at high risk are candidates for long-term oral anticoagulation as the benefits of extended oral anticoagulation would outweigh the risk of bleeding. Patients are currently stratified into risk categories on the basis of clinical characteristics of the VTE event: (1) first or recurrent event; (2) idiopathic or due to a transient risk factor such as surgery, trauma, hormonal therapy, or immobilization; (3) presence of active cancer; (4) location (proximal DVT and/or pulmonary embolism, PE, or distal DVT); and (5) presence of known hereditary or acquired thrombophilia. Patients with distal VTE or VTE due to a transient risk factor are at a low risk of recurrence and short-term anticoagulation is indicated (3 months). Patients with an idiopathic event or with known thrombophilic defects such as FV Leiden or the G20210A prothrombin mutation are candidates for a longer course of therapy (6 months). Patients with cancer, antiphospholipid antibodies syndrome, recurrent idiopathic event, antithrombin deficiency, protein C or protein S deficiency, homozygosity for FV Leiden, and double heterozygosity are candidates for extended long-term anticoagulation. More recently, studies have indicated that other factors such as D-dimer levels after the discontinuation of OAC therapy or the residual vein thrombosis could be additional predictive factors for recurrences. In patients with VTE and cancer, oral anticoagulation poses a higher risk of bleeding, and such patients are more prone to recurrences. Alternative treatment with LMWH could be safer and more effective in these patients."
CD010864,0,15938684,0,Venous thromboembolism: diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) affects 0.5-1 per 1000 people in the general population each year, and is one of the most common preventable causes of death among hospitalised patients. The clinical diagnosis of PE is unreliable and must be confirmed objectively with ventilation perfusion scanning or computed tomography pulmonary angiography. The diagnosis of PE can be reliably excluded, without the need for diagnostic imaging, if the clinical pretest probability for PE is low and the D-dimer assay result is negative. The initial treatment of PE is low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin for at least 5 days, followed by warfarin (target international normalised ratio [INR], 2.0-3.0) for at least 3-6 months. Patients with a high clinical pretest probability of PE should commence treatment immediately while awaiting the results of the diagnostic work-up. Thrombolysis is indicated for patients with objectively confirmed PE who are haemodynamically unstable. Percutaneous transcatheter or surgical embolectomy may be life-saving in patients ineligible for, or unresponsive to, thrombolytic therapy. Unresolved issues in the management of venous thromboembolism include the roles of thrombophilia testing, thrombolysis for the treatment of stable PE patients who present with right ventricular dysfunction, and new anticoagulants; and the duration of anticoagulation for first unprovoked venous thromboembolism."
CD010864,0,11563814,0,Circulating soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor as a marker for diagnosis of pulmonary embolus.,"The purpose of this clinical study was to determine the relationship between plasma soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (T.N.F.R.) and pulmonary embolism. The histological evidence of the interaction between leukocytes and the venous wall of a thrombosed vein, as well as the over-production of TNF in plasma prompted us to assay a more stable polypeptide, namely TNF receptor, as potential markers for pulmonary embolism. Five mL of plasma were obtained from twenty patients, ranging in the age from 24 to 74 years, who had been diagnosed as having pulmonary embolism through pulmonary angiography, and 20 healthy volunteers in the same age group. The samples were then studied by enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for measurement of soluble TNF receptor. Patients with pulmonary embolism maintained a higher serum concentration of soluble TNF receptors. It appears that plasma measurement of soluble TNF receptor could be used as a clinical test for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism."

Sera were examined for group-specific rotavirus antibody using a blocking enzyme immunoassay (bELISA) and a hemagglutination inhibition antibody (HIA) test, and for anti-VP2, anti-VP4, anti-VP6, and anti-VP7 antibodies using an immunoblotting assay (IBA). Antibody prevalence was similar in all bELISA and HIA assays, showing a steep rise in the 6-to 17-month-old age groups. The results indicate early acquisition of antibody to rotavirus. The majority of children aged 2 to 4 years had bELISA (50% to 60%) and HIA (70% to 81%) antibodies. There was an association in prevalence data obtained by HIA and bELISA with immunoblotting (IBA), revealing four serologic profiles. Children with profiles I and II (60%) respectively had HAI and ELISA antibody or HAI antibody alone and all had immunoprotective antibodies to VP4 and/or VP7. These children were regarded as ""immune,"" resembling convalescent patients with a rotavirus infection. Children with profile III (4%) had no HIA antibody and only non-protective anti-VP6 and/or VP7 antibody, and were considered to be ""partially immune."" Children with profile IV (36%) had no detectable antibody and were classified as ""nonimmune."" These children should be considered to be susceptible to rotavirus infection, with the risk of developing clinically severe diarrhea."

Other tests included D-dimer (DD), lower limb venous ultrasound (US), ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan, and angiography. Outcome measures were 3-month survival and costs per patient managed. Baseline sensitivity of CT was 70%, corresponding to the performance of single-detector CT, and that figure was raised in sensitivity analysis to account for the expected higher sensitivity of newer multidetector CT scanners. All strategies were compared with a reference strategy, namely the V/Q scan in all patients followed when nondiagnostic by an angiogram. For low clinical probability patients, the most cost-effective strategy was DD, US, and V/Q scan, patients with a nondiagnostic V/Q scan being left untreated. Replacing V/Q scan by CT was also cost-effective. For intermediate and high clinical probability patients, a fourth test must be added, either CT or angiography in patients with nondiagnostic V/Q scan, or angiography in patients with a negative helical CT. When using sensitivity figures above 85% (in the multidetector range), DD, US, and CT became the most cost-effective strategy for all clinical probability categories. Helical CT as a single test was not cost-effective. In summary, including helical CT in diagnostic strategies for pulmonary embolism is cost-effective provided that it is combined with DD and US. In contrast, helical CT as a single test is not cost-effective."

Indeed, the clinical complications (from post-thrombotic syndrome to fatal pulmonary embolism) as well the risk of anticoagulant treatment require a precise diagnosis. Since clinical evaluation cannot assure reliably diagnosis by lack of sensitivity and specificity, complementary exams are needed. However, clinical assessment is an important part to decide further examinations. D-dimers assessment allows to role out the diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis in a number of cases. Plethysmography and continuous Doppler are progressively given up. Compressive venous ultrasonography is now the exam of first choice. Scintigraphy, scanner and RMI must still be validated.

This study has been designed to determine whether inhalation of urban air induces HSP70 expression in the lung and blood as well as the association of HSP70 and air pollution-induced vascular dysfunction. Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) deficient mice were exposed to diesel exhaust (DE) either acutely (3 days, 200 or 400 Âµg/m(3) for 6âh/day) or chronically (7 weeks, 200 or 400 Âµg/m(3) for 6âh/day). HSP70 was measured in the lung using immunohistochemistry, and in the plasma by ELISA. Abdominal aorta rings were used to determine vascular functional responses. Chronic DE-exposure increased the fraction of HSP70 positive alveolar macrophages (AM) that was related to the fraction of particle-laden AM in the lung (r(2)â=â 0.48, pâ<0.01). Chronic DE-exposure increased plasma HSP70 levels and reduced blood vessel responses to phenylephrine (PE).

We examined circulating concentrations of adhesion molecules and C-reactive protein (CRP), markers for endothelial and inflammatory reactions, in addition to blood pressure and anthropometric measurements in 58 women with a history of PE and 49 control women with no pathology associated to pregnancy. Soluble adhesion molecules were measured by standard commercial ELISA methods and plasma CRP levels by automated enzymatic assays. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and waist-to-hip ratios were significantly higher in women with history of PE than in control group. There were no significant differences in circulating levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and CRP in the study population. Women with a history of PE do not have a persistent inflammatory state that could induce overexpression of these molecules, which was supported by normal levels of CRP. The study supports the existence of common risk factors for PE and CVD, namely obesity and hypertension."

The binding protein was solubilized with Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40 and purified on a PE-Sepharose affinity column. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded a single band with an estimated molecular mass of greater than 300,000 Da. N-Linked carbohydrate was present, accounting for approximately 10% of the total mass of the molecule. The purified protein specifically bound PE. Incubation of purified protein specifically bound PE. Incubation of purified PE binding protein with toxin reduced toxicity to LM cells. We speculate on the role of this toxin binding glycoprotein in the intoxication process."

CD010864,0,21630313,0,A prognostic model for short term adverse events in normotensive patients with pulmonary embolism.,"Risk stratification of patients with PE has gained interest in terms of the identification of patients in whom treatment on an outpatient base can be considered. Previous studies are of limited value due to their focus on adverse clinical events within several months after diagnosis of PE. We developed a prognostic model, based on easily accessible, clinical, and laboratory parameters, to predict adverse events during the first 10 days after the diagnosis of acute PE. We have analyzed the data of 210 outpatients with confirmed PE. Collected data included medical history, pulse rate, blood pressure, NT-proBNP, and D-dimer concentrations. The primary outcome was the occurrence of adverse clinical events in a 10 day follow-up period. Our final prognostic model to predict short-term adverse events consists of NT-proBNP levels, D-dimer concentrations, pulse rate, and the occurrence of active malignancy; the total score ranges from 0 to 37 points. Patients with a low score (no active malignancy, pulse rate <90 bpm, NT-proBNP <500 pg/ml, and D-dimer <3,000 Î¼g/l FEU) have a 10-day adverse event risk <1.5%. This risk increases to over 30% in patients with a maximum score, based on high pulse rate, D-dimer concentrations, and NT-proBNP levels. Our prognostic model, once prospectively validated in an independent sample of patients, can be used in the early risk stratification of PE to estimate the risk of adverse events and to differentiate between candidates for in- or out- hospital treatment."
CD010864,0,20581664,0,Thrombophilia and the risk of thromboembolic events in women on oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy.,"Thrombophilia contributes to the risk of thrombosis in women using female hormones. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of thrombophilia in women with thromboembolic events (TEEs) using oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and assess the contribution of a family history and the duration of hormone use in predicting thrombosis. A retrospective analysis was performed of the case records of women who developed a TEE while on oral contraceptives or HRT and were referred for thrombophilia evaluation over a 4-year period. Among 85 women who developed a TEE while on oral contraceptives or HRT, 65 had at least one additional thrombophilia risk factor. Of the 85 cases, 23 tested positive for more than two thrombophilias, 16 had factor V Leiden, five had the prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism, 26 had antiphospholipid antibodies, 10 had elevated homocysteine, four had protein C deficiency, and seven had protein S deficiency. There were 64 TEE: 16 pulmonary emboli, 17 cerebrovascular events, 11 intra-abdominal thromboses, 13 deep venous thromboses, five cases of superficial thrombophlebitis, and two retinal vein thromboses. Of the 65 women, 37% had a positive family history of thrombosis. Approximately half of the women had been taking oral contraceptives or HRT for more than 1 year. There is a high prevalence of thrombophilia in women who developed a TEE while using oral contraceptives or HRT for more than 1 year. Family and personal history of thrombosis should be carefully evaluated in all women before initiating or continuing oral contraceptives or HRT, and a positive history may warrant a thrombophilia screening."

CD010864,0,8082370,0,Antinuclear antibodies in pleural fluid.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) frequently involves the pleura with resultant pleural effusion. Previous studies have reported that detection of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in pleural fluid using animal tissue as substrate was a sensitive and specific method for distinguishing SLE pleural effusions from other etiologies. The HEp-2 ANA, which uses a human cell line as substrate, is now the preferred ANA test; however, to our knowledge, no studies on pleural fluid using this assay have been reported. To determine its sensitivity and specificity, when measured in pleural fluid, HEp-2 ANA levels were determined in pleural effusion samples associated with a variety of different etiologies, including SLE, malignancy, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and a miscellaneous group of diseases. Pleural fluid ANA results were positive in 14 of 82 samples. Six of the eight (75 percent) pleural fluid samples collected from patients with SLE were ANA positive, and all but one had high titers (> 1:160) with a homogenous staining pattern. The remaining two patients with SLE with negative pleural fluid ANA had recurrent pulmonary emboli and congestive heart failure, rather than lupus pleuritis. Eight of 74 patients (10.8 percent) without clinical evidence of SLE had a positive pleural fluid ANA, with the majority having a speckled pattern. High titers were noted in three. These results indicate that a negative or low titer ANA and a speckled staining pattern in pleural fluid from a patient suspected of lupus pleuritis suggest an alternative diagnosis. High pleural fluid titers (up to 1:640) were seen occasionally in patients with inflammatory pleural effusions in the absence of SLE."

No serum bound to PE uncontaminated with lysophosphatidylethanolamine (1PE), but many aPL-positive sera bound to 1PE-contaminated PE and to 1PE coated onto an ELISA plate. Absorption studies indicated partial cross-reactivity between PE containing 1PE and cardiolipin. We conclude that clinical aPLs do not bind to PE.

Excessive production of placental PAI-1 has been associated with aberrant periplacental fibrin deposition in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In the current study we used HTR-8/SVneo cells and primary cultures of cytotrophoblasts as models for study of PAI-1 regulation by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid (GC). ELISA and Northern blotting assays revealed that DEX treatment significantly enhanced TGF-beta effects on PAI-1 protein and mRNA expression in HTR-8/SVneo cells and cytotrophoblasts. These effects were GC-specific in that DEX and cortisol, but not estradiol, progesterone or testosterone, augmented PAI-1 levels in TGF-beta-treated cells. Conversely, DEX and TGF-beta treatment suppressed PAI-2 levels in HTR-8/SVneo cells and did not affect PAI-2 levels in cytotrophoblasts. PAI-1 promoter assays revealed that TGF-beta, but not DEX, enhanced PAI-1 expression in HTR-8/SVneo cells through a transcriptional mechanism. These results suggest that GC and TGF-beta may alter fibrinolytic and invasive properties of trophoblasts through their effects on PAI-1 expression."
CD010864,0,7841318,0,Coagulation activation and reactive fibrinolysis in patients receiving oral anticoagulation after total hip or knee replacement.,"Twenty patients having routine laboratory control of oral anticoagulation after total hip or knee arthroplasty were consecutively included in the study and were anticoagulated at an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2.5 and 3.5. Patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses (n = 20), deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (n = 20), at the same level of oral anticoagulation, served as control groups. Plasma concentrations of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and D-dimer were measured and compared. In the mechanical heart valve prosthesis and deep venous thrombosis groups the median prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 concentrations were significantly lower than in the orthopaedic patient group (0.15 and 0.17 nmol/l versus 0.29 nmol/l). The D-dimer concentrations displayed a similar picture (150 and 200 micrograms/l versus 840 micrograms/l). The D-dimer/prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 ratios in the patients after total hip or knee arthroplasty were significantly higher (12.4) than in the control groups (5.3 and 6.0). These data show that the fibrinolysis/coagulation balance is enhanced, mainly due to a disproportional rise in D-dimer. After assessing when the D-dimer concentration returns to normal in this anticoagulated group, this parameter may indicate the appropriate duration of oral anticoagulant treatment after surgery for total knee or hip replacement."
CD010864,0,12786647,0,Diagnosing pulmonary embolism: a question of too much choice?,"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is difficult with many patients treated without the disease or left untreated without an adequate diagnostic work up. Recent advances in PE diagnosis are reviewed. The use of risk stratification in PE diagnosis is strongly recommended and evidence on how it can best be performed summarized. The Ginsberg/Wells stratification rule is recommended currently as the best validated rule. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was found to have quite poor sensitivity and to be poorly validated. It is recommended as adequate as a positive test in moderate/high risk groups and an exclusionary test in low risk groups or where an adequate alternative diagnosis is found. For D-Dimer tests the only test with adequate sensitivity and validation in management studies is the VIDASCopyright D-Dimer. This is in low/intermediate risk groups in the ED population. The Simpli-RedCopyright test is also reviewed but is too insensitive for most populations. Echocardiography: this is good in compromised patients as it is a bedside test which when negative virtually excludes PE. If positive in the right setting it has a high positive predictive value. A negative echocardiogram predicts a benign clinical course for PE. The rest of the paper details the authors approach to integrating these new techniques with established algorithms and where progress is likely to occur in the next few years. These include improvements in CTPA (plus the addition of CT venography), new point of care D-Dimer tests, better risk stratification rules and integration of new strategies with artificial neural networks or computerized guidelines."

Since there is no part of the history, physical examination or noninvasive laboratory findings that is specific, a tentative criteria for diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism is proposed based a scoring system. Pulmonary thromboembolism can be classified into 5 different types: (1) massive pulmonary thromboembolism, (2) recurrent or occult pulmonary thromboembolism, (3) diffuse pulmonary microthromboembolism, (4) submassive pulmonary thromboembolism, (5) pulmonary infarction. We have carried out a series of model experiments in order to clarify the mechanism of the development of pulmonary microthromboembolism and the production of pulmonary infarction. On the basis of this data, we suspect that hyperfibrinolysis, endothelial damages and activated permeability factors lead to the interstitial and alveolar edema in pulmonary microthromboembolism or severe hemorrhage in pulmonary infarction. The combination therapy of UK (480,000 units) and DS (3,000 mg) had two advantages: (1) inhibition of shortening of APTT, (2) economy of UK dosage. Laboratory monitoring for effective UK therapy showed a markedly reduced alpha 2PI to under 50% of normal levels and fibrinolysis associated with fibrinogenolysis. The therapeutic effects of heparin were assessed by prolonged APTT (45-250 sec) and elevated Anti-FXa activity (0.2-1.2 u/ml of plasma heparin concentration) as an indicator for the evaluation of anticoagulation activity and by normalized FPA, Fbg, FDP, Plg and AT III as an indicator for evaluation of antithrombolic activity."

The presence of antibodies was examined by using the respective ELISA kits. LA was positive in 38.6% of patients with DVT/PE, suggesting that LA is one of the most important risk factors in DVT/PE. The highest prevalence of anti-beta(2) glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) IgG was in CT and SLE, followed by DVT, and none in ITP and healthy volunteers (control, n = 40), suggesting that it is related to thrombosis, particularly arterial thrombosis. The highest prevalence of anti-prothrombin (aPT) IgG antibody was in DVT, followed by CT and SLE, and none in ITP and the control, suggesting that it is related to thrombosis, especially venous thrombosis. The highest prevalence of antiphospholipid (aPL) IgG was in DVT, CT, and SLE, but 0% in ITP and control. On the other hand, aPL IgM, anti-annexin V IgG, and anti-annexin V IgM were positive in patients both with and without thrombosis, suggesting that they are not related to thrombosis. Our results indicated that among the anti-phospholipid antibodies, LA is the most sensitive marker for APS while anti-beta(2)GPI IgG, aPT IgG, and aPL IgG are risk factors for thrombosis. In particular, aPT IgG is a significant marker for DVT/PE."
CD010864,0,2954258,0,Indices of fibrinogen proteolysis and platelet activation during the resolution of pulmonary embolism.,"Indices of fibrinogen cleavage by thrombin (fibrinopeptide A, FPA); by plasmin (BB1-42 and serum FDP); of the platelet release reaction (beta thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4); and antithrombin III (AT III) levels were measured serially in 46 patients with pulmonary emboli in whom either substantial (SR) or impaired (IR) resolution was documented. The mean FPA level in the 25 patients with IR was significantly higher than the level in the 21 patients with SR (p less than 0.01). The increased thrombin activity in the IR group was not due to AT III deficiency or increased platelet reactivity but the elevated FPA levels in the presence of therapeutic levels of anticoagulation indicated that the dose of heparin was inadequate. The higher BB1-42 and FDP levels in this group reflected the increased plasmin activity that follows increased thrombin activity. In a multivariate discriminant analysis, only the FPA data could be used to predict the degree of resolution. Increased thrombin action impairs resolution presumably by producing greater amounts of accreted fibrin on the impacted embolus."

First, a study of 100 patients was performed in order to choose the best couple of antibodies in comparison with an already clinically validated ELISA. Then the results were certified in a prospective study including 195 consecutive patients suspected of pulmonary embolism (PE). For a cut-off level of 500 ng/ml VIDAS D-dimer showed a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval 92-100), a specificity of 37.6%, a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI 93.3-100) and a positive predictive value of 33.1%.

The purpose of this study was to determine if coadministration of CT with a potassium thiocyanate extract of Pasteurella multocida (PTE) leads to enhanced anti-PTE antibody activity and increased protection of rabbits against infection with P. multocida and associated disease. Groups of rabbits were immunized intranasally on days 0, 7, and 14, with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 200 micrograms of CT, 1.0 mg of PTE, or 1.0 mg PTE with 200 micrograms CT. Nasal lavage and serum samples were collected over 28 days after initial immunization and evaluated by ELISA for specific antibody directed against PTE. Marked increases in serum (IgG) and nasal lavage (IgA) anti-PTE antibody activity were found beginning after day 14 in rabbits immunized with PTE. Rabbits immunized with PTE and CT demonstrated further increases in this activity. Tracheobronchial lavage samples collected at the time of necropsy demonstrated a significant level of anti-PTE IgA activity in animals immunized with PTE, and coadministration with CT stimulated a further significant increase in this activity. Groups of similarly immunized rabbits were challenged 16 days after initial immunization with 5 x 10(7) CFUs of P. multocida. Nasal lavage samples were cultured for P. multocida over the next 10 days. Rabbits were euthanized within 10 days after challenge, tissues cultured for P. multocida, and histopathologic lesion severity graded using a numeric scale. Rabbits immunized with PTE survived longer, had less severe lesions of the lungs, pleura, and liver, and fewer P. multocida CFUs cultured from samples than PBS or CT controls. Coadministration of CT led to further reductions in lesion severity of those tissues and numbers of P. multocida CFUs cultured from samples. Increased nasal turbinate atrophy of rabbits immunized with PTE with or without CT was associated with increased mean survival time. In summary, coadministration of CT with PTE enhanced protective immunity to P. multocida disease and infection in rabbits."

Following bolus injection in hamsters, clearances of recombinant scu-PA (rscu-PA) and of K12G0S32 were similar. In contrast, clearance of K12G2S32 was fourfold slower than that of rscu-PA. The thrombolytic potency (percent lysis per u-PA administered in milligrams per kilogram body weight) and specific thrombolytic activity (percent lysis per microgram per milliliter steady-state plasma u-PA antigen level) of these compounds were studied in hamsters with an experimental pulmonary embolus consisting of a human plasma clot injected via the jugular vein. The doses of K12G0S32 and K12G2S32 required to obtain maximal rate of clot lysis were sixfold and 11-fold lower than that of rscu-PA. The steady-state u-PA-related plasma antigen levels of K12G0S32 and K12G2S32 required to obtain maximal rate of clot lysis were 10-fold and fourfold lower than that of rscu-PA. Thus, targeting of K12G0S32 to the clot surface by means of its glycosylated Fv fragment results in a 10-fold increase of its specific thrombolytic activity and sixfold increase of its thrombolytic potency as compared with those of rscu-PA. Targeting of K12G2S32 to the clot surface by means of its deglycosylated Fv fragment results in only a twofold increase of its thrombolytic activity. However, its fourfold slower clearance, combined with its twofold higher specific thrombolytic activity, results in an 11-fold increase of its thrombolytic potency over that of rscu-PA. These findings indicate that the thrombolytic potency of chimeric antibody-targeted PA may be increased by increasing the specific thrombolytic activity, reducing the clearance, or both."

CD010864,0,20386413,0,Syncope: a rare presentation of massive pulmonary embolism in a previously healthy girl.,"Pulmonary embolism is a very infrequent event in previously healthy children, particularly in the outpatient scenario. This report involves a 7-year-old girl who presented to the emergency room after syncope. A prompt diagnostic workup showed a massive pulmonary embolism. A timely treatment initiation permitted a good and rapid response. She represented a diagnostic and treatment challenge, mainly because of the atypical presentation and the absence of known risk factors. Finally, a thorough study uncovered a nephrotic-range urine protein loss. At the beginning, the patient did not meet the whole nephrotic syndrome diagnostic requirements. The complete thombophilic study was normal. The clinical presentation, epidemiology, diagnostic tools and the treatment of pulmonary embolism are reviewed. We also discuss a recently described risk factor, present in our patient, as a potential role in the development of pulmonary embolism."

Thirdly, the sensitivity and specificity of IMA is compared with D-dimer both with and without clinical probability scores in patients with suspected PE."
CD010864,0,15901281,0,Fibroblast control on epithelial differentiation is gradually lost during in vitro tumor progression.,"This study aimed to investigate the role of underlying fibroblasts on morphogenesis of in vitro epithelium reconstituted with normal and neoplastic human oral keratinocytes at various stages of malignant transformation. Primary normal human oral keratinocytes (NOKs), early neoplastic/dysplastic human oral keratinocytes (DOK cell line), and neoplastic human oral keratinocytes (PE/CA-PJ 15 cell line) were organotypically grown on top of a collagen type I matrix with or without primary normal human oral fibroblasts. Morphogenesis of the reconstituted epithelia was assessed by histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry (Ki-67, cyclin D1, cytokeratin 13 (CK13), collagen IV, E-cadherin, p53, CD40), and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP in situ nick end-labelling method. Reproducible in vitro models of multistage oral carcinogenesis were established. Presence of fibroblasts in the collagen matrix significantly increased cell proliferation in all three models (p<0.05), and induced an invasive pattern of growth in the neoplastic cell lines (p<0.05). In normal, but not in neoplastic oral keratinocytes fibroblasts induced the expression of CD40, and polarized the expression of E-cadherin and p53 to the basal cell layer. In both normal and early neoplastic keratinocytes (DOK cell line), fibroblasts induced the expression of CK13 and collagen IV. In the neoplastic oral keratinocytes (PE/CA-PJ 15 cell line), the presence of underlying fibroblasts did not change the expression of any of the protein markers assessed. This study showed that (1) major steps of oral carcinogenesis can be reproduced in vitro, and (2) the tight control exerted by fibroblasts on epithelial morphogenesis of in vitro reconstituted normal human oral mucosa is gradually lost during neoplastic progression."

CD010864,0,17344142,0,[B-type natriuretic hormone--diagnostic and prognostic cardiovascular biomarker].,"Brain natriuretic hormone and N-terminal-probrain natriuretic hormone are equally important cardiovascular biomarkers. Moderately increased brain natriuretic hormone level is a reliable predictor of preclinical, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Low brain natriuretic hormone levels are extensively used to rule out acute heart failure. Increased brain natriuretic hormone is associated to age, left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial volume, atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, acute pulmonary embolism and progressive aortic stenosis. In chronic heart failure only high brain natriuretic hormone values support the diagnosis. High brain natriuretic hormone level, however, is an important overall cardiovascular prognostic biomarker. In the near future brain natriuretic hormone appears to be an interesting new therapeutic modality."
CD010864,0,2102791,0,"Monoclonal antibody-based plasma assays for fibrin(ogen) and derivatives, and their clinical relevance.","The haemostatic balance can basically be described as the equilibrium between fibrin formation (coagulation) and fibrin lysis (fibrinolysis). The status of this balance may therefore be reflected by the products of these two processes. Until recently, the tests for assessment of fibrin(ogen) degradation products were performed in serum since they were based on polyclonal antibodies, which cross-react with fibrinogen. However, the use of serum introduces many artefacts so the utility of these serum tests is limited. New assays have now become available, which can be divided into quantitative enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and semi-quantitative latex agglutination assays. The new assays can be carried out in plasma since they use highly specific monoclonal antibodies, the majority of which do not cross-react with fibrinogen. This makes it possible to avoid the serum artefacts. Furthermore, these plasma assays can discriminate between degradation products of fibrin and those of fibrinogen (FbDPs and FgDPs, respectively). The possible clinical utility of the new assays is discussed on the basis of literature data on the following clinical states: deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, liver disease and liver transplantation, sickle cell disease, renal diseases, pregnancy and preeclampsia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), malignancy, coronary artery disease and thrombolytic therapy. Fibrinolysis appears to be accompanied by fibrinogenolysis. Detection of fibrin(ogen) derivatives may be used to rule out DVT and to monitor efficacy of anticoagulant treatment for DVT or DIC, and reflects severity of renal disease but not renal function. High levels of FgDPs were found during orthotopic liver transplantation and thrombolytic therapy. Fibrin(ogen) degradation products cannot be used to predict reperfusion following thrombolytic therapy. The fibrinolytic system remained active during normal and complicated pregnancy and in patients with malignancies. The new assays provide valuable information on fibrin(ogen)olysis in several diseases. More information on the haemostatic balance may be obtained by using these new assays for fibrin(ogen)olysis products in combination with assays for coagulation products."
CD010864,0,2762044,0,Detection and typing of paraproteins: comparison of different methods in a routine diagnostic laboratory.,"In this paper we review four methods: Protein electrophoresis (PE), immunoelectrophoresis (IEP), immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) and a nephelometric kappa:lambda ratio method for the ability, first, to detect, and second, to isotype paraproteins in urine and serum. IFE was the most sensitive assay both in the detection of paraproteins and the most accurate in their typing. The nephelometric kappa:lambda ratio was associated with false-positive and false-negative results and cannot be considered suitable for routine diagnostic use. Although IFE was the most sensitive assay it was not without problems. Dilution of the serum to produce a concentration suitable for IFE is critical, and the assay is demanding in operator skill and time. The extra paraproteins identified by IFE are generally of low concentration and with the exception of certain well-defined clinical situations are probably not of great importance in patient management. In the case of diseases where the demonstration of a small amount of paraprotein is important, such as amyloidosis, then IFE should be performed in case other techniques fail to demonstrate a paraprotein. Otherwise, IFE is best reserved for paraproteins detected by PE which cannot be typed by IEP. A schema for the management of paraprotein identification for use in a routine diagnostic laboratory is presented."
CD010864,0,8404171,0,Pulmonary diffusion abnormalities in heart transplant recipients. Relationship to cytomegalovirus infection.,"Lung function of patients with heart failure is characterized by a variety of changes proposed as being due to passive congestion, secondary pulmonary fibrosis, and/or recurrent pulmonary emboli. A diffusion impairment thought to be due to cyclosporine has also been noted in patients following heart transplantation. Similar changes of unclear origin have been observed in renal transplant recipients. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which lung function changes are reversible by cardiac transplantation and relate changes to the status of the recipients lung in the presence of possible vascular, iatrogenic, immune, or infectious injury. We analyzed the data of 22 patients who underwent lung function testing before and after heart transplantation and correlated changes to hemodynamic change, episodes of rejection, concentration of cyclosporine, and cytomegalovirus infection. Despite excellent graft function, the carbon monoxide transfer factor deteriorated to a mean of 57 percent of predicted postoperatively. The fall in diffusion factor did not correlate with episodes of cardiac rejection, cyclosporine levels, or hemodynamic status. In those patients who had serologic evidence of cytomegalovirus infection, the reduction in transfer factor was greater compared to those without infection despite a normal chest radiograph. The effects of cardiopulmonary bypass were unlikely to have been responsible for the abnormalities as lung function was assessed at a mean of 14 months after surgery. In heart transplant recipients, a change in diffusion capacity may represent an additional marker for cytomegalovirus infection and reflect infectious/immune injury late following surgery."
CD010864,0,15799639,0,[The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: the best strategies according to the results of a large Dutch multicentre study].,"The Dutch national guidelines for the diagnosis of patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (from 1992 en 1998) are poorly followed in clinical practice, due especially to practical objections. A large multicentre trial to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the available modalities and of recently developed techniques such as D-dimer determination, (99m)Tc-gas-scintigraphy and spiral CT scanning was started in I997. In the first phase, the diagnostic value was assessed of: spiral CT (sensitivity 69%, specificity 84%; sensitivity for segmental and larger pulmonary embolisms (PE) 86% and for subsegmental PE 21%), (99m)Tc-gas-ventilation scintigraphy (no improvement compared to conventional ventilation scintigraphy), D-dimer determination (sensitivity for segmental PE 93% and for subsegmental PE 53%, specificity 63%), clinical decision rules (in combination with D-dimer determination; sensitivity 100%, specificity 11%) and echography of the deep venous system (sensitivity 26% for segmental PE and 7% for subsegmental PE, specificity 97%). In the second phase, the feasibility of two new potentially cost-effective diagnostic algorithms was evaluated on the basis of the results obtained in the first phase and data in the literature. In 631 patients, a clinical risk estimate was made and D-dimer determination was done, followed by a ventilation-perfusion scan and serial compression echography of the leg veins. An apparent recurrence of PE occurred in 6 of 466 patients in whom no PE had been found originally (1.3%; 95% CI: 0.5-2.8). The average costs were 812 Euro,--per patient. In 510 patients, a spiral CT followed by compression echography was performed. Recurrent PE occurred in 3 of 378 patients with initial normal tests (0.8%; 95% CI: 0.2-2.3). The average costs were 883 Euro,--per patient. A combination of both strategies can be cost-effective with a cost 674 Euro,--per patient (recurrence rate: 1.9%). Both the strategy starting with a clinical-risk estimate and a D-dimer determination as well as the strategy consisting of spiral CT and serial echography were safe and cost-effective. According to the results of a survey of hospital directors, internists and pulmonologists, both are well accepted in clinical practice."

A pretest probability (PTP) assessment is required for the results of this diagnostic test to be interpreted correctly and applied appropriately. Without this assessment, the physician may misinterpret the test results and proceed to unnecessary diagnostic imaging (DI) or inappropriate discharge.

CD010864,0,19547991,0,Intraneuronal pyroglutamate-Abeta 3-42 triggers neurodegeneration and lethal neurological deficits in a transgenic mouse model.,"It is well established that only a fraction of Abeta peptides in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients start with N-terminal aspartate (Abeta(1D)) which is generated by proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE. N-terminally truncated and pyroglutamate modified Abeta starting at position 3 and ending with amino acid 42 [Abeta(3(pE)-42)] have been previously shown to represent a major species in the brain of AD patients. When compared with Abeta(1-42), this peptide has stronger aggregation propensity and increased toxicity in vitro. Although it is unknown which peptidases remove the first two N-terminal amino acids, the cyclization of Abeta at N-terminal glutamate can be catalyzed in vitro. Here, we show that Abeta(3(pE)-42) induces neurodegeneration and concomitant neurological deficits in a novel mouse model (TBA2 transgenic mice). Although TBA2 transgenic mice exhibit a strong neuronal expression of Abeta(3-42) predominantly in hippocampus and cerebellum, few plaques were found in the cortex, cerebellum, brain stem and thalamus. The levels of converted Abeta(3(pE)-42) in TBA2 mice were comparable to the APP/PS1KI mouse model with robust neuron loss and associated behavioral deficits. Eight weeks after birth TBA2 mice developed massive neurological impairments together with abundant loss of Purkinje cells. Although the TBA2 model lacks important AD-typical neuropathological features like tangles and hippocampal degeneration, it clearly demonstrates that intraneuronal Abeta(3(pE)-42) is neurotoxic in vivo."
CD010864,0,7836544,0,A simple enzyme immunoassay for measurement of immune complex solubilization utilizing preformed peroxidase-antiperoxidase complexes.,"An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was developed for measurement of complement-mediated solubilization of immune complexes. Preformed complexes consisting of horseradish peroxidase (Pe) and anti-Pe antibodies were incubated in diluted serum. After centrifugation the soluble complexes in the supernatant were quantitated by adding peroxidase substrate followed by measurement of absorbance. Kinetic analysis of revealed significant difference between normal and EDTA-treated serum similarly to a standard assay utilising immune complexes containing radiolabelled bovine serum albumin. The difference was most pronounced after incubation of immune complexes with serum for 40 minutes. Immune complex solubilization measured by EIA was reduced in sera from 10 patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In serially followed patients, flares of SLE were preceded by reduction of solubilization capacity. The EIA is a simple method for determining serum capacity to solubilize preformed immune complexes and might be considered as a routine test for assessment of complement function in diseases such as SLE."

CD010864,0,15850645,0,Increased phospholipase A2 and thromboxane but not prostacyclin production by placental trophoblast cells from normal and preeclamptic pregnancies cultured under hypoxia condition.,"In this study we determined whether hypoxia could promote vasoactivator thromboxane (TX) and prostacyclin (PGI2) as well as phospholipase A2 (PLA2) production by placental trophoblast cells (TCs) from normal and preeclamptic (PE) pregnancies. Placentas were obtained immediately after delivery from normal (n=9) and preeclamptic (n=9) pregnancies. TCs were isolated by dispase digestion of villous tissue and purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation. TCs (5x10(6) cells/well) were cultured with Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) under hypoxia condition (2% O2/5% CO2/93% N2) for 48 h. TCs cultured under normoxia condition (5% CO2/air) were used as control. Culture medium was collected at the end of incubation. Productions for TX, PGI2 and PLA2 were measured by ACE competitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney U test or paired t-test and the data are expressed as mean+/-SE (pg/microg cellular protein). Significance was set at a p-value of <0.05. We found: (1) PE-TCs produced more TXB2 and PLA2 than normal-TCs under normoxia conditions, TXB2: 4.33+/-1.03 vs. 1.84+/-0.29 pg/microg protein, p<0.05; PLA2: 0.38+/-0.08 vs. 0.21+/-0.03 pg/microg protein, p<0.05, respectively. (2) Hypoxia promoted both PE- and normal-TCs to generate more TXB2 and PLA2, TXB2: 6.36+/-1.72 vs. 3.05+/-0.45 pg/microg; PLA2: 0.52+/-0.10 vs. 0.30+/-0.04 pg/microg, respectively. (3) No change in 6-keto PGF1alpha production was observed for normal-TCs or PE-TCs when compared under normoxia vs. hypoxia condition, normal-TCs: 0.20+/-0.05 vs. 0.21+/-0.05 pg/microg; PE-TCs: 0.38+/-0.05 vs. 0.36+/-0.04 pg/microg, respectively. We concluded that hypoxia promotes both PLA2 and TX, but not PGI2, production by placental trophoblast cells cultured under hypoxia condition. These results suggest that increased PLA2 release may alter the arachidonic acid cascade and promote TX synthesis. Relative hypoxia could contribute to the increase in TX production and result in vasoconstriction in placental vasculature in preeclampsia."

CD010864,0,19203744,0,Role of computed tomography in the evaluation of acute chest pain.,"Chest pain is common and the initial clinical presentation is often nonspecific. The emergency physician faces the challenge of correctly identifying those patients with a life-threatening cause of chest pain while avoiding unnecessary hospital admissions. Three important life-threatening causes of chest pain are aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and acute coronary syndrome. Simple clinical tools should be applied to exclude these diagnoses and avoid CT whenever possible. A normal serum d-dimer measurement can safely exclude pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection, although elevated d-dimer levels are common and nonspecific. Promising markers for early myocardial ischemia have been described and should be developed further. CT provides a first-line imaging tool for aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism based on its wide availability, speed, and high level of diagnostic performance. Improvements in CT scanner technology now enable in-depth data on the coronary arteries. Although angiographic information is limited in its relation to physiologic lesion significance, coronary CT is used to safely diagnose or exclude coronary disease as a source of chest pain in emergency department patients. ""Triple rule-out"" protocols designed to simultaneously assess the aorta, pulmonary arteries, and coronary arteries are a compromise between dedicated protocols for each diagnosis.

CD010864,0,2273666,0,[A case of primary pulmonary hypertension with high venous thromboxane B2 concentration].,"A 30-year-old male was admitted because of dyspnea, which had started three years before the admission. Chest roentgenogram showed prominence of the proximal pulmonary arteries and diminished vascularity of the peripheral pulmonary arteries. Electrocardiogram showed right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. Right heart catheterization revealed a markedly elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance with normal capillary wedge pressure. Oximetry showed no evidence of intracardiac shunt. Perfusion lung scan revealed nonsegmental, patchy defects in both lungs. Pulmonary arteriography showed no evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism. From the above findings, primary pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed. Nifedipine, ISDN, prazosin, and captopril were administered to evaluate the short term-effect of he vasodilators. Nifedipine was found to be the most effective. The venous thromboxane B2 level was high. After oxygen therapy, venous thromboxane B2 level fell within the normal range following improvement of arterial oxygenation and decrease in venous FDP level. Hemodynamic changes induced by ice-water hand immersion showed marked increase in the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and total pulmonary arterial resistance. These results suggested that chemical mediators such as thromboxane, and pulmonary arterial vasospasm were involved in the pathogenesis."

In the Eisenmenger syndrome, correlations of these abnormalities with the clinical status and occurrence of chronic intravascular coagulation (CIC) have not been confirmed. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the occurrence of CIC, as determined by circulating levels of D-dimer is associated with changes in endothelial markers in Eisenmenger patients; and to identify variables that correlate with the severity of clinical presentation. Twenty-one patients were enrolled (ages, 4-52 years). Plasma levels of D-dimer, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), thrombomodulin, and von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to differentiate patients with stable (group 1, N=12) from those with unstable disease (group 2, N=9). Increased t-PA (p<0.0001) and vWF:Ag (p=0.001) and decreased thrombomodulin (p<0.0001) were associated with increased D-dimer levels (p=0.0201) in patients. Group 2 had a higher prevalence of affected women (p=0.0242), lower arterial oxygen saturation, and higher t-PA levels compared with group 1 (p<0.0001, discriminant analysis). t-PA and vWF:Ag correlated positively in group 2 (r=0.71, p=0.0309), but not in group 1 (r=0.25, p=NS). Two patients in group 2 but none in group 1 had episodes of pulmonary arterial thrombosis. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with evidence of CIC and correlates to some extent with the severity of symptoms in these patients."
CD010864,0,10352312,0,Does IgE bind to and activate eosinophils from patients with allergy?,"Human eosinophils have been reported to express both the mRNA and protein for the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI); it is speculated that this receptor plays a role in eosinophil mediator release in allergic diseases. However, questions still remain. How much of the FcepsilonRI protein is actually expressed on the cell surface of the eosinophil? If they are present, are these IgE receptors associated with effector functions of eosinophils? To address these issues, we studied blood eosinophils from patients with ragweed hay fever. A high level of low affinity IgG receptor (FcgammaRII, CD32), but no expression of FcepsilonRI, was detectable on the eosinophil surface by standard FACS analysis. However, after in vitro sensitization with biotinylated chimeric IgE (cIgE), cell-bound cIgE was detected by PE-conjugated streptavidin. This cIgE binding was partially inhibited by anti-FcepsilonRI mAb, suggesting that eosinophils do express minimal amounts of FcepsilonRI detectable only by a sensitive method. Indeed, FACS analysis of whole blood showed that eosinophils express approximately 0.5% of the FcepsilonRI that basophils express. When stimulated with human IgE or anti-human IgE, these eosinophils did not exert effector functions; there was neither production of leukotriene C4 or superoxide anion nor any detectable degranulation response. In contrast, eosinophils possessed membrane-bound human IgG and showed functional responses when stimulated with human IgG or anti-human IgG.

CD010864,0,20659721,0,Venous thromboembolic events in the rehabilitation setting.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease entity that encompasses both deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. During the past decade there have been significant advances in the understanding of prophylaxis and treatment of VTE. There is an extensive research base from which conclusions can be drawn, but the heterogeneity within the rehabilitation patient population makes the development of rigid VTE protocols challenging and overwhelming for the busy clinician. Given the prevalence of this condition and its associated morbidity and mortality, we review the evidence for the prevention, identification, and optimal treatment of VTE in the rehabilitation population. Our goal is to highlight studies that have the most clinical applicability for the care of VTE patients from a physiatrist's perspective. At times, information about acute care protocols is included in our discussion because these situations are encountered during the consultation process that identifies patients for rehabilitation needs."

CD010864,0,20162251,0,[Diagnostics in venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism].,"Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (venous thromboembolism) have a prevalence as high as 1-2/1000/year. Timely diagnosis and therapy prevent or reduce the acute life threatening and the long term disabling complications. Due to the variability in its signs and symptoms, venous thromboembolism should frequently be considered as a differential diagnosis. When doing so, only one in five or six suspected cases actually will have the disease. A low estimate of the clinical probability in conjunction with a negative D-Dimer test may rule out the diagnosis in 40-50% of cases. All other patients need imaging procedures. Current standard of care for deep vein thrombosis is venous ultrasound of the leg, for pulmonary embolism it is CT pulmonary angiography. Sensitivity and specificity of both methods are high enough to allow for a definitive diagnosis. Diagnostic challenges remain the suspicion of relapsing disease and venous thromboembolism in pregnancy."
CD010864,0,3956964,0,[A test for the detection of fibrin in the plasma].,"The article reports on measurements of D dimer, a terminal plasmic lysis product of crosslinked fibrin, with an enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) employing recently developed specific monoclonal antibodies. Due to its sensitivity the test can be used on plasma samples. The D dimer concentrations in patients with deep vein thrombosis diagnosed by laboratory apparatus were significantly increased compared to a control group; in one patient with additional pulmonary embolism, the level was even higher. Moderately elevated concentrations of D dimer were observed in the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy, puerperium and during the postoperative course. This reduces the specificity of the test with regard to the recognition of thromboembolic episodes under these conditions. Obstetric patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) showed excessively increased levels of D dimer. Hence, a marker function with regard to the recognition of thromboembolic disease can be attributed to the D dimer; the diagnosis of DIC can be confirmed if very high concentrations are detected."

Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) positively regulates mTORC1. We have studied whether Rheb is sufficient to activate mTOR signaling and promote protein synthesis and cardiac hypertrophy in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (ARVC). Rheb was overexpressed via an adenoviral vector in isolated ARVC. Overexpression of Rheb in ARVC activated mTORC1 signaling, several components of the translational machinery and stimulated protein synthesis. Our direct visualization approach to determine ARVC size revealed that overexpression of Rheb also induced cell growth and indeed did so to similar extent to the hypertrophic agent, phenylephrine (PE). Despite potent activation of mTORC1 signaling, overexpression of Rheb did not induce expression of the cardiac hypertrophic marker mRNAs for brain natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic factor, while PE treatment did markedly increase their expression. All the effects of Rheb were blocked by rapamycin, confirming their dependence on mTORC1 signaling. Our findings reveal that Rheb itself can activate both protein synthesis and cell growth in ARVC and demonstrate the key role played by mTORC1 in the growth of cardiomyocytes."

CD010864,0,1299237,0,Studies on the role of interleukin-4 and Fc epsilon RII in the pathogenesis of minimal change nephrotic syndrome.,"Childhood minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) has often been associated with allergic symptoms such as urticaria, bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and elevated IgE levels and referred to involve immune dysfunction. Fc epsilon RII is known to be involved in IgE production and response. Interleukin-4 is being recognized as a major cytokine up-regulating IgE production. Hence the present study is aimed at investigating the role of interleukin-4 and Fc epsilon RII in the pathogenesis of MCNS. IgE was measured by ELISA. Fc epsilon RII was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell scanner (FAC-scan) by double antibody staining with anti Leu16-FITC and anti Leu20-PE. Soluble IgE receptor was measured by ELISA using anti CD23 antibody (3-5-14). Interleukin-4 activities were measured by CD23 expression on purified human tonsillar B cells. Serum IgE levels were significantly higher in MCNS (1,507 +/- 680 IU/dl) than in normal controls (123 +/- 99.2 IU/dl). A significantly higher expression of membrane Fc epsilon RII was noted for MCNS (41 +/- 12%) than that in normal controls (18 +/- 6.2%) (p < 0.001). Soluble CD23 levels were also significantly higher in MCNS (198 +/- 39.3%) than in normal controls (153 +/- 13.4) (p < 0.01). Interleukin-4 activity in sera of MCNS (12U/ml) was also significantly higher than normal controls (4.5U/ml). These results indicate that increased production of Fc epsilon RII and interleukin-4 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MCNS."
CD010864,0,21986993,0,Translational analysis of mouse and human placental protein and mRNA reveals distinct molecular pathologies in human preeclampsia.,"Preeclampsia (PE) adversely impacts ~5% of pregnancies. Despite extensive research, no consistent biomarkers or cures have emerged, suggesting that different molecular mechanisms may cause clinically similar disease. To address this, we undertook a proteomics study with three main goals: (1) to identify a panel of cell surface markers that distinguish the trophoblast and endothelial cells of the placenta in the mouse; (2) to translate this marker set to human via the Human Protein Atlas database; and (3) to utilize the validated human trophoblast markers to identify subgroups of human preeclampsia. To achieve these goals, plasma membrane proteins at the blood tissue interfaces were extracted from placentas using intravascular silica-bead perfusion, and then identified using shotgun proteomics. We identified 1181 plasma membrane proteins, of which 171 were enriched at the maternal blood-trophoblast interface and 192 at the fetal endothelial interface with a 70% conservation of expression in humans. Three distinct molecular subgroups of human preeclampsia were identified in existing human microarray data by using expression patterns of trophoblast-enriched proteins. Analysis of all misexpressed genes revealed divergent dysfunctions including angiogenesis (subgroup 1), MAPK signaling (subgroup 2), and hormone biosynthesis and metabolism (subgroup 3). Subgroup 2 lacked expected changes in known preeclampsia markers (sFLT1, sENG) and uniquely overexpressed GNA12. In an independent set of 40 banked placental specimens, GNA12 was overexpressed during preeclampsia when co-incident with chronic hypertension. In the current study we used a novel translational analysis to integrate mouse and human trophoblast protein expression with human microarray data. This strategy identified distinct molecular pathologies in human preeclampsia. We conclude that clinically similar preeclampsia patients exhibit divergent placental gene expression profiles thus implicating divergent molecular mechanisms in the origins of this disease."
CD010864,0,12958612,0,"Role of blood coagulation factor XIII in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Correlation of factor XIII antigen levels with pulmonary occlusion rate, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and clot firmness.","In patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary occlusion rate is directly related to D-dimer and inversely related to fibrinogen levels. The role of coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) levels in acute venous thromboembolism is not known. A total of 120 consecutive patients with suspected PE and VIDAS D-dimer levels >500 micro g/L were investigated by helical computed tomography (CT). Pulmonary occlusion rate was assessed by CT using the modified Miller index. D-dimer, fibrinogen, and FXIII A- and B-subunit antigen levels were taken on admission. Thrombelastography (TEG) was performed in a subset of patients (n = 12). The 71 patients with PE had lower FXIII A-subunit levels than the 49 patients with excluded PE (78.6 +/- 24.5% vs. 91.3+/-28.8%, p=0.01). In both groups, FXIII A-subunit was inversely related to D-dimer levels. FXIII A-subunit correlated with fibrinogen levels in patients with PE but not in patients without PE. FXIII A-subunit decreased with increasing pulmonary occlusion rate. The risk of PE was increased in the presence of A-subunit levels < 60% (OR 7.0 [95% CI 1.4-35.3], p = 0.019). Clot firmness determined by TEG was lower in patients with PE than in patients without PE. In patients with PE, circulating FXIII A-subunit is decreased compared to patients with suspected but excluded PE. The higher the clot burden within the pulmonary arteries the lower the FXIII antigen. In these patients, direct relation of FXIII A-subunit to fibrinogen levels argues for significant consumption of these coagulation factors in PE. This consumption of FXIII can also be detected by a global coagulation test like TEG."

Quantitation of PE in middle ear effusions (MEE) from 10 patients with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) were also performed. In CSOM, 12 of 14 samples revealed a significant amount of PE from 0.6 microliter/ml to 62.1 microliters/ml, which was significantly higher than those in MEE (p less than 0.05). In MEE, 8 of 10 samples were under the detection limit. Two samples in CSOM with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection had high levels of PE. The quantitation was linear, with a concentration from 5 ng PE/sample to 500 ng PE/sample. This ELISA system is a sensitive method for quantitation of PE requiring only very small samples."
CD010864,0,15199501,0,Looking for deep vein thrombosis in suspected pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis are two facets of the same disease, that is, venous thromboembolism (VTE). In patients with angiographically proven PE, the prevalence of proximal deep vein thrombosis by venography is around 70%. The sensitivity of compression ultrasonography (US) for the diagnosis of acute VTE in patients with a suspicion of PE is between 40 and 60%, with a high specificity (96 to 100%). Taking into account the 20 to 30% prevalence of PE in a population consulting for suspicion of this disease, the first line use of compression US will allow the diagnosis of acute VTE in half of patients with confirmed PE, that is, in 10 to 15% of patients addressed for suspicion of PE. In outpatients, the first line use of D-dimers which will exclude acute VTE in one-third of the initial population will slightly increase the reliability of compression US as a first imaging test. New tools of looking for deep vein thrombosis, such as computed tomographic venography coupled with computed tomographic pulmonary angiography, could become an interesting approach in the diagnostic strategy of PE, but require adequate evaluation in prospective studies."
CD010864,0,19268750,0,Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the coronary care unit.,"The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is difficult in coronary care units (CCUs) because many findings of PE are similar to those of acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. Immobilization of only 1 or 2 days may predispose to PE. Heart failure and acute myocardial infarction add to the risk. Dyspnea may be absent or occur only with exertion. The onset of dyspnea may occur over seconds to days. Orthopnea occurs with PE as well as heart failure. When the clinical probability and results of objective testing are discordant, the posttest probability of PE may be neither sufficiently high nor sufficiently low to permit therapeutic decisions. Objective scoring systems for clinical assessment have not been developed for patients in a CCU. d-dimer is likely to be of little value for the exclusion of PE in CCUs, because elevations occur with heart failure, unstable angina, and myocardial infarction. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography with venous phase imaging of the low pelvic and proximal leg veins (computed tomographic venography) is recommended for imaging. Scintigraphy in women aged <50 years with normal or nearly normal results on chest x-ray may be the preferred imaging test to reduce the risk for radiation. Echocardiography with leg ultrasonography is a rapidly obtainable combination of bedside tests that may be useful for young patients and patients in extremis. In conclusion, the choice of diagnostic test depends on the clinical probability of PE, the condition of the patient, the availability of diagnostic tests, the risks of iodinated contrast material, radiation exposure, and cost."

However, the rate of venous thromboembolic complications in the three-month follow-up of patients with negative CT was still substantial and included fatal events. It was the objective to evaluate the safety of withholding anticoagulants after a normal 64-detector row CT (64-DCT) scan from a cohort of patients with suspected PE. A total of 545 consecutive patients with clinically suspected first episode of PE and either likely pre-test probability of PE (using the simplified Wells score) or unlikely pre-test probability in combination with a positive D-dimer underwent a 64-DCT. 64-DCT scanning was inconclusive in nine patients (1.6%), confirmed the presence of PE in 169 (31%), and ruled out the diagnosis in the remaining 367. During the three-month follow-up of the 367 patients one developed symptomatic distal deep-vein thrombosis (0.27%; 95%CI, 0.0 to 1.51%) and none developed PE (0 %; 95%CI, 0 to 1.0%).

Patients with heterozygous protein C deficiency are at a high risk to develop venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. In newborns with homozygous protein C deficiency with very low protein C levels (1%) a purpura fulminans like syndrome was observed. Heparin and coumarin derivatives are effective drugs in heterozygous protein C deficiency, homozygous patients may be treated either by replacement of protein C or coumarin derivatives. Decreased protein C levels were observed in various other diseases: Chronic and acute liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation, malignancy, postoperatively and during treatment with asparaginase.

As pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) can share features of pulmonary remodelling, we postulated that the two disorders might be associated with different types of pulmonary endothelial dysfunction. We studied 25 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation for suspected pulmonary hypertension. Nine patients had PAH, nine had CTEPH, and seven had normal pulmonary arterial pressure and served as controls. Circulating endothelial cells were isolated with CD146-coated beads. CD34(+)CD133(+) cell and endothelial progenitor cell numbers were respectively determined by flow cytometry and cell culture, in peripheral vein and pulmonary artery blood. Plasma levels of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble E-selectin and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM) were measured by ELISA. No difference in progenitor counts or VEGF levels was found across the three groups. Compared to controls, circulating endothelial cell numbers were significantly increased in PAH but not in CTEPH, in keeping with the elevated soluble E-selectin and sVCAM levels found in PAH alone. In conclusion, PAH, in contrast to CTEPH, is associated with markers of vascular injury (circulating endothelial cells, soluble E-selectin and sVCAM) but not with markers of remodelling (endothelial progenitor cells, CD34(+)CD133(+) cells and VEGF)."

The cultures were evaluated at day 12 for total cell proliferation (fold increase from day 0), neutrophil differentiation by flow cytometry, using dual staining with CD15-FITC and CD11b-PE, and morphology using Wright-Giemsa and granule staining. In cultures containing PIXY321 where 6000 U/ml of G-CSF was added days 0 and 6, there was no significant difference (p > or = 0.05) in cell proliferation or the percent of CD15+/CD11b+ cells when compared with cultures with PIXY321 alone. ELISA analysis showed G-CSF levels had declined by 90% after 3 days of culture. Further studies were performed to assess the benefit of supplementing lower concentrations of G-CSF (600 U/ml) at more frequent intervals. A significant increase (p < or = 0.05) in cell proliferation and percent CD15+/CD11b+ was observed when G-CSF was added on days 0, 3, 6, and 9 (every 3 days) as compared with those cultures with PIXY321 alone. CD34+ cell proliferation without G-CSF was 19.6 +/- 4.8-fold, with G-CSF added on days 0 and 6 was 28.7 +/- 6.4-fold, and with G-CSF added on days 0, 3, 6, and 9 was 45.9 +/- 10.6-fold. Percent of CD15+/CD11b+ cells was 19.0 +/- 4.6%, 38.2 +/- 7.2%, and 58.5 +/- 6.5%, respectively, in these cultures. We observed more CD15+/CD11b+ cells, myelocytes/metamyelocytes, and secondary granule staining in cultures with G-CSF added on day, 0, 3, 6, and 9 as compared with cultures with G-CSF added on days 0 and 6 or no G-CSF added. We conclude that PIXY321 and G-CSF act synergistically on the in vitro proliferation and neutrophil differentiation of BM and PB CD34+ cells and that frequent supplements of G-CSF facilitate neutrophil differentiation."

CD010864,0,19687251,0,Steric and not structure-specific factors dictate the endocytic mechanism of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins.,"Diverse glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins enter mammalian cells via the clathrin- and dynamin-independent, Arf1-regulated GPI-enriched early endosomal compartment/clathrin-independent carrier endocytic pathway. To characterize the determinants of GPI protein targeting to this pathway, we have used fluorescence microscopic analyses to compare the internalization of artificial lipid-anchored proteins, endogenous membrane proteins, and membrane lipid markers in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Soluble proteins, anchored to cell-inserted saturated or unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-polyethyleneglycols (PEGs), closely resemble the GPI-anchored folate receptor but differ markedly from the transferrin receptor, membrane lipid markers, and even protein-free PE-PEGs, both in their distribution in peripheral endocytic vesicles and in the manner in which their endocytic uptake responds to manipulations of cellular Arf1 or dynamin activity. These findings suggest that the distinctive endocytic targeting of GPI proteins requires neither biospecific recognition of their GPI anchors nor affinity for ordered-lipid microdomains but is determined by a more fundamental property, the steric bulk of the lipid-anchored protein."

Using as criterion a between-run impression CV <20% the functional limit of detection was set at 0.1 microg/l. Cutoff level for minor myocardial damage of 0.1 microg/l was found. In Duchenne's dystrophy, patients showed increased cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) but no increased cTnI. In patients with a history of coronary heart disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis, cTnT and cTnI were increased. In different patients with submassive pulmonary embolism, increased cTnI was determined. In coronary artery bypass surgery without perioperative myocardial infarction, patients with extracorporeal circulation showed significantly higher cTnI at 24 h after surgery than those with minimal cardiac surgery.

It is known that prognosis is strictly linked to timely recognition of the pathogenetic-clinical phase of the thromboembolic disease and that prevention, therefore, plays the leading role in patients at risk. The most recent series show that, in absence of prophylaxis, the frequency of DVT, diagnosed by objective tests, is still significant in abdominal surgery. Modern diagnostic tools make possible to identify relatively silent clinical thrombosis, also with laboratory tests (i.e., D-dimer plasma levels). The Authors report a study on thromboembolic episodes in patients who underwent pneumoperitoneum with CO2 during laparoscopic abdominal surgery, compared to a control group submitted to open surgery. They underline the importance of a careful preoperative evaluation of the venous system, by Doppler study, in order to identify, patients at risk of DVT and establish a suitable anti-thrombotic prophylaxis."
CD010864,0,16222624,0,The rehabilitation of clinical assessment for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis of segmental pulmonary embolism, but no longer for subsegmental pulmonary embolism because the inter-observer agreement for angiographically documented subsegmental pulmonary embolism is only 60%. A normal rapid ELISA VIDAS D-dimer test result and a normal perfusion scan exclude pulmonary embolism with a negative predictive value of >99%, irrespective of clinical score. The positive predictive value for pulmonary embolism of a high probability VP-scan compared to pulmonary angiography is 87% indicating that 13% of patients with a high probability VP-scan do not have pulmonary embolism. The combination of a negative CUS, a low clinical score, and a non-diagnostic VP-scan safely excludes pulmonary embolism. Patients with a non-diagnostic VP-scan, a negative CUS, but a moderate to high clinical score are candidates for pulmonary angiography. The positive predictive value of helical spiral CT is >95 to 99%. The combination of a negative CUS, a low clinical score, and the presence of a clear alternative diagnosis is predicted to safely exclude pulmonary embolism. Helical spiral CT detects all clinical relevant pulmonary emboli and a large number of alternative diagnoses in symptomatic patients with a non-diagnostic or a high-probability VP-scan. The negative predictive value during 3 months followup after a negative spiral CT for pulmonary embolism in 4 retrospective studies and 1 prospective management study was >99%. Only a small group of patients (1-2%) with a non-diagnostic spiral CT are candidates for pulmonary angiography. Therefore, it is predicted that the spiral CT will replace both VP-scanning and pulmonary angiography to safely exclude or diagnose pulmonary emboli in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism."

The composition of the liposomes mainly containing soybean phosphatidylcholine (PC) was varied by the addition of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC). To evaluate the lipid-protein interactions, the amount of aprotinin in the MLV-aprotinin complexes was determined. Lipid-protein interactions were found to strongly depend on the liposome composition, medium pH and ionic strength. These dependencies point to the electrostatic nature of the aprotinin-lipid interactions. 31P NMR spectroscopy of the MLV-aprotinin complexes indicated that aprotinin influences the phospholipid structure in MLV at pH 3.0. In the case of PC:PE:PI and PC:PE:PI:lyso-PC vesicles, aprotinin induced liposome aggregation and a lamellar-to-isotropic phase transition of the phospholipids."

CD010864,0,22033585,0,The N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide based short-term prognosis in patients with acute pulmonary embolism according to renal function.,"N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is currently used for risk stratification in acute pulmonary embolism (PE). We aimed to clarify the impact of renal function on the validity of the NT-proBNP based prognosis, assuming that the biomarker is accumulated in renal insufficiency. The NT-proBNP based prediction of PE related in-hospital death was investigated according to renal function in 329 patients with acute PE. The normalized NT-proBNP ratios (NT-proBNP level divided by the age-adjusted normal upper range) were inversely correlated (rÂ =Â -0.414, PÂ <Â 0.001) to the estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR). A cut-off point ofÂ â¥Â 2.5 for the normalized NT-proBNP ratio was found to be best for the prediction of mortality (AUC 0.716, 95% CI 0.626-0.805, PÂ <Â 0.001) and was a significant predictor for death in univariate and multivariate analysis. A normalized NT-proBNP ratioÂ â¥Â 2.5 was a significant predictor for PE-mortality only in patients with an eGFRÂ â¥Â 60Â ml/min/1.73Â mÂ². Renal insufficiency significantly predicted mortality in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. High-risk PE and cerebrovascular diseases were significantly more frequent in renal dysfunction and significantly predicted death in univariate and multivariate analysis. The validity of the NT-proBNP based short-term prognosis might be limited in renal dysfunction not only by accumulation, but also because renal insufficiency itself and concurrent conditions are contributing to PE related mortality."
CD010864,0,23469860,0,P2X7 receptor activation contributes to an initial upstream mechanism of lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular dysfunction.,"Pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and ROS (reactive oxygen species) are excessively produced in endotoxaemia. However, attempting to inhibit all of these inflammatory signalling pathways at the same time in order to prevent endotoxaemia is difficult. In a previous study we observed that activation of P2X7 receptors elicited the release of IL (interleukin)-1Î² from LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-incubated vessels. In the present study, we hypothesize that P2X7 receptor activation is the initial event leading to vascular dysfunction following LPS treatment. LPS-induced decreases in MAP (mean arterial pressure) and pressor responses to NE (noradrenaline) were attenuated in P2X7KO (P2X7-knockout) mice. Hyporeactivity in response to PE (phenylephrine) in isolated mesenteric arteries by LPS treatment was also observed in C57BL/6 [WT (wild-type)] mice, which was prevented by IL1ra (IL-1 receptor antagonist), L-NAME (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) and indomethacin and in P2X7KO mice. In addition, treatment with IL1ra plus L-NAME produced an additive inhibition of LPS-induced vascular hyporeactivity, suggesting different signalling pathways between IL-1Î² and NOS (NO synthase). LPS-induced plasma levels of IL-1Î², TNFÎ± (tumour necrosis factor Î±), IL-10, vascular eNOS (endothelial NOS) and COX2 (cyclo-oxygenase 2) protein expression, as determined by ELISA and Western blot, observed in WT mice were inhibited by IL1ra and in P2X7KO mice. These results suggest that P2X7 receptor activation involves an initial upstream mechanism of LPS-induced vascular dysfunction, which is associated with IL-1Î²-mediated eNOS, COX2 activation and TNFÎ± release."
CD010864,0,19323066,0,[Ischemia modified albumin--specific marker in cardiological diagnostics?].,"Ischemia modified albumin (IMA) is a new biological marker for early identification of chest pain and ruling out myocardial infarction among patients with acute syndromes submitting to emergency department. Recently IMA has been investigated in the light of other cardiac markers (cTnT, CK-MBmas, NT-proBNP) in various states of ischemia (acute coronary syndromes, after percutaneous coronary intervention, in coronary vasospasm). Ischemia modified albumin levels were elevated in these states what suggests myocardial ischemia. However decrease in IMA concentration after exercise-induced skeletal muscle ischemia still remains unclear. Increased IMA concentration in patients with acute ischemic stroke and exposed to trauma limits its ability for detection myocardial ischemia. Specificity of IMA measurement is limited also in patients with peripheral vascular disease, systemic sclerosis, diabetes, end stage renal disease, pulmonary embolism and other pathological states with accompanying oxidative stress."

Platelets constitute the major source of soluble CD40 ligands (sCD40L), which has been shown to influence platelet activation. The main aim of this study was to evaluate sCD40L levels in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Sixty-five PE patients (32 males, mean age 58 Â± 12 years) and 29 healthy controls (15 males, mean age 56 Â± 14 years) were enrolled in the study. sCD40L levels were evaluated at the enrollment by ELISA method. Multislice detected pulmonary computed tomography was performed on all patients with a suspected diagnosis of PE. In addition, echocardiography was performed to evaluate right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding demographic features. sCD40L levels were significantly higher in acute PE group compared to healthy controls (5.3 ng/ml and 1.4 ng/ml, respectively; p < 0.001). sCD40L levels of patients with and without RV dysfunction were similar. Correlation analysis between echocardiographic findings and sCD40L levels did not show significant difference. The present study demonstrated a role of sCD40L in pathogenesis of PE for the first time. Further studies are needed to clarify a predictive and prognostic value of sCD40L levels in acute PE patients."

The D-dimers can be useful for the exclusion of VTE during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. In case of suspicion of DVT, the diagnosis can be made by non-invasive means with lower limb venous compression ultrasonography (CUS). In case of suspicion of PE, pulmonary imaging is often necessary. Scintigraphy is the best validated diagnostic test, but helical computed tomography is frequently proposed due to its higher availability. Fetal radiation is very low with both imaging techniques, and the potentially fatal outcome of undiagnosed PE widely justifies performing these tests."

CD010864,0,16328353,0,Serious foetal growth restriction is associated with reduced proportions of natural killer cells in decidua basalis.,"Extravillous trophoblasts are major participants in placental development and remodelling of spiral arteries. Trophoblast invasion is regulated by maternal immune cells, and abnormal leucocyte subpopulation composition has been reported in implantation failure. In pre-eclampsia (PE), with or without foetal growth restriction (FGR), superficial trophoblast invasion and insufficient remodelling of spiral arteries are common findings. In the present study, we have compared spiral artery remodelling and leucocyte composition in decidual tissue from 30 cases (PE=8, FGR=5, PE + FGR=17) and 31 controls. Six histological remodelling criteria were established, and each pregnancy obtained a remodelling score. Numbers of natural killer (NK) cells (CD56+), T cells (CD3+) and activated (CD25+ or CD69+) leucocytes were determined and related to total leucocyte (CD45+) numbers in serial sections. Cases demonstrated significantly impaired spiral artery remodelling, inappropriate placental growth and reduced NK cell proportions, as compared to controls (P=0.02, P<0.001 and P=0.01, respectively). Reduced NK cell proportion was primarily found in pregnancies complicated by FGR, with or without PE, and a significant positive correlation was observed between NK cell proportion, trophoblast infiltration and placental growth. Our in vivo observations support the hypothesized association between NK cells, impaired placental development and pathogenesis of PE/FGR."

Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs), receptors for AGEs (RAGE), and RAGE ligands are involved in systemic inflammation in various pathological conditions. In this study, we measured serum RAGE ligands in normal pregnancy controls and PE patients. Levels of Carboxymethyl Lysine (CML), HMGB1 and S100A12/EN-RAGE were measured in thirty-three normal pregnant women 3 times at 10-12 (1st measurement), 28 (2nd measurement), and 36 (3rd measurement) weeks during gestation for paired analysis. We also measured those in serum samples from 17 severe PE patients at admission using ELISA. Early onset (EO, <32 weeks) and late onset (LO, â¥32 weeks) PE patients were compared with the 2nd and 3rd measurements of normal controls, respectively. CML and HMGB1 did not change during normal pregnancy. However, S100A12/EN-RAGE decreased from the 1st to 2nd measurement (P<0.0001). Across all PE patients, serum CML was unaltered, while HMGB1 significantly increased compared to 2nd (P=0.0002) and 3rd (P<0.0001) measurement as well as individually compared to both EO (P=0.018) and LO groups (P=0.0001). S100A12 in all PE patients increased over 2nd (P=0.0015) and 3rd (P=0.0002) measurements, although only LO was significantly increased compared to the 3rd measurement (P=0.0005).

In this study, we used a removal system for high-abundance proteins followed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE combined with nano-LC-MS/MS to generate a comprehensive MPE proteome data set with 482 nonredundant proteins. Next, we integrated the MPE proteome and secretome data sets from three adenocarcinoma cell lines, with a view to identifying potential PE biomarkers originating from malignant cells. Four potential candidates, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG), angiogenin, cystatin-C, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2, (IGFBP2), were isolated for preclinical validation using ELISA. Both AHSG and IGFBP2 levels were increased in lung patients with MPE (n = 68), compared to those with nonmalignant pleural effusion (n = 119). Notably, the IGFBP2 level was higher in MPE, compared with that in benign diseases (bacteria pneumonia and tuberculosis pleuritis), and significantly associated with malignancy, regardless of the cancer type. Our data additionally support an extracellular function of IGFBP2 in migration in lung cancer cells. These findings collectively suggest that the adenocarcinoma MPE proteome provides a useful data set for malignancy biomarker research."

In those cases, a so-called second-line treatment protocol is used in addition to conventional therapy strategies. This manuscript is a report on three APS pregnant patients who were successfully treated with plasma exchange (PE) (two cases) or with immunoadsorption (IA) (one case) as a second-line treatment strategy. The efficacy of these procedures in removing anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-Î²(2)glycoprotein I (aÎ²(2)GPI) antibodies from blood was evaluated. Serum samples were collected before and after 87 apheretic treatment sessions.

The Th1/Th2 cytokine paradigm of the immune adaptation in pregnancy is now expanded to include Th1/Th2/Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Among cytokines, TGFÎ²1 has properties that justify evaluation of its role in PE etiopathology. In this investigation the polymorphisms of the TGFÎ²1 gene at promoter region, positions -800GâA and -509CâT, were studied in 142 PE and 140 normal pregnant female subjects using PCR-RFLP. Additionally, serum TGFÎ²1 was determined by ELISA. At position -800GâA genotypes and allele frequencies showed no significant differences between PE patients (GG 73.9%; GA 21.1%; AA 4.93%) and normal control (GG 70%; GA 28.6%; AA 1.4%) women. However the AA genotype at this position was more frequent in PE patients than in the control group. At -509CâT position, genotypes and allele frequencies showed no significant differences between PE patients and control individuals. The CC genotype at -509CâT position was more prevalent in PE patients than in the control group. The mean serum TGFÎ²1 level was significantly higher (62.14 ng/ml) in PE patients compared with pregnant and non-pregnant control groups (and 47.01 and 40.68 ng/ml, respectively). In conclusion, the promoter region polymorphisms of TGFÎ²1 may not be associated with PE, but serum levels of this cytokine may contribute to the etiopathology of PE."
CD010864,0,20046012,0,[Early diagnosis of connective tissue disease-related pulmonary hypertension].,"It is known that prognosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH), especially connective tissue disease related PH (CTD-PH), is serious.

Recently, prognosis of PH is improved by progress of diagnostic measures including echocardiography and development of effective vasodilators. However, early diagnosis of PH is necessary for further improvement of the prognosis. Previous reports have shown that diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) is reduced in the early phase of PH, and we have shown that serum lactate dehydrogenase level is also elevated in this phase. Furthermore, we have been studying significance of stress echocardiography. Therefore, if reduced DLco or LDH elevation are recognized, follow up of laboratory data such as blood levels of KL-6, NT-proBNP, D-dimer, echocardiography, high resolution CT of the lung, in addition to clinical findings are important for prediction of PH."

Thirteen RTRs with PTE, 42 RTRs without PTE, and 42 healthy controls were included. Serum sSCF and EPO levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.

In RTRs with PTE, sSCF level was significantly correlated with hematocrit and observed/expected EPO, respectively. Significant correlation was also observed between hematocrit level and observed/expected EPO in RTRs with PTE. Increased sSCF level and inadequate suppression of EPO production seem to have a role in the pathogenesis of PTE."

The early stratification of risk from unstable angina to non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), is crucial in the timing and treatment of the ACS. Troponin elevations have also been shown to be powerfully prognostic in a variety of clinical settings and because of this predictive value, may be useful in determining benefit of various clinical interventions. However, inherent in this improved sensitivity and specificity of the measurement tools is the inclusion of non-ACS patients with abnormal troponin measurements. Increased understanding of the alternative diagnoses associated with elevated troponins as well as assays which allow more rapid and accurate diagnosis of ACS, are needed to further improve patient care.

CD010864,0,8397711,0,Antibodies to cardiolipin in normal C57BL/6J mice: induction by estrogen but not dihydrotestosterone.,"Autoantibodies against cardiolipin, a phospholipid, have been demonstrated in a variety of pathological states including several autoimmune conditions in humans and in certain lupus-prone mice. In this study we detected antibodies reactive to cardiolipin in normal C57BL/6J mice by ELISA. The autoantibodies are detected less frequently in the serum of male than in female mice, suggesting the influence of sex hormones. The relative refractoriness of normal male mice to the induction of anticardiolipin antibodies is not due to the suppressive effects of male hormones, since prepubertal orchiectomy has little influence on this autoantibody. Further, dihydrotestosterone treatment of orchiectomized mice has minimal effect on anticardiolipin antibodies. However, orchiectomized mice when given estrogen develop a marked increase in the incidence as well as the levels of these autoantibodies. Similarly, estrogen treatment of female mice further augments the incidence and the levels of these autoantibodies. Estrogen-treated mice also have antibodies reactive against other membrane phospholipids including phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The intensity of binding of autoantibodies to the above phospholipids varies among individual mice. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the demonstration of antiphospholipid autoantibodies in normal mice and induction of these antibodies by estrogen."

Thus validation of simple laboratory tests that reliably predict venous thromboembolism (VTE) would be clinically very important. Tests that might be useful for these applications include markers of hypercoagulability (predicting patients at risk of DVT) and D-dimer (predicting which patients may have acute DVT)."

CD010864,0,15523804,0,[Comparison between D-dimer levels and lung scan in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism].,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical situation that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Lately, the use of D-Dimer (DD) blood level test was recommended when PE is suspected. The goal of this work was to evaluate the association between DD levels and the results of lung scan in patients with suspected PE. 84 patients who were admitted due to suspected PE and met the inclusion criteria of having both DD test and lung scan within less than 7 days apart, were included in our study (age = 76 +/- 14, females = 58, males = 26). Comparison of lung scan results, DD level and diagnosis of PE at discharge was carried out. The subjects were classified into 2 groups according to the DD levels: group A = DD > or = 250 ng/mL--abnormal test, group B = DD < 250 ng/mL--normal test. Group A includes 67 patients, of which 29 (43%) were diagnosed as PE. In these subgroup lung scan showed high Probability (HP) for PE in 19 (66%), medium probability (MP) in 9 (31%) and low probability (LP) in 1 (3%). From the 38 (57%) patients who were not diagnosed with PE (non-PE), 5 (13%) had HP lung scan, 4 (11%) MP and 29 (76%) LP. Group B includes 17 patients, in which only one (6%) had diagnosed with PE and the rest (n = 16, 94%) had no PE. Of the latter subgroup 15 (94%) had LP lung scan and one MP scan. The one patient who was diagnosed with PE had a HP lung scan that was also confirmed with CT-angiography. DD and lung scan had similar sensitivity (96.7%) and high negative predictive value (NPV = 94.1% and 97.8% accordingly) for PE. On the other hand DD specificity is much lower (29.6%) in comparison to lung scan (81.5%). The results of this work support the use of DD test prior to lung scan, in order to rule out PE with relatively high probability."

CD010864,0,18781175,0,Silent venous thromboembolism before treatment in endometrial cancer and the risk factors.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) often occurs after surgery and can even occur before surgery in patients with gynaecological malignancies. We investigated the incidence of VTE before treatment of endometrial cancer and associated risk factors. Plasma D-dimer (DD) levels before initial treatment were examined in 171 consecutive patients with endometrial cancer. Venous ultrasound imaging (VUI) of the lower extremities was performed in patients with DD >or=1.5 microg ml(-1), as the negative predictive value of DD for VTE is extremely high. For patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary scintigraphy was performed to ascertain the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). Risk factors for VTE were analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses for 171 patients. Of these, 37 patients (21.6%) showed DD >or=1.5 microg ml(-1), 17 (9.9%) displayed DVT by VUI and 8 (4.7%) showed PTE on pulmonary scintigraphy. All patients with VTE were asymptomatic. Univariate analysis for various risk factors revealed older age, non-endometrioid histology and several variables of advanced disease as significantly associated with VTE before treatment. Obesity, smoking and diabetes mellitus were not risk factors. Multivariate analysis confirmed extrauterine spread and non-endometrioid histology as independently and significantly associated with risk of VTE. These data suggest that silent or subclinical VTE occurs before treatment in at least around 10% of patients with endometrial cancer. Risk factors for VTE before treatment might not be identical to those after starting treatment."
CD010864,0,15722673,0,The diagnostic evaluation of pulmonary embolism.,"Due to the morbidity and mortality associated with either untreated disease or inappropriate anticoagulant therapy, accurate diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is essential. Pulmonary angiography, the current gold standard test for diagnosing pulmonary embolus, is both invasive and costly; therefore, noninvasive diagnostic strategies have been developed. Noninvasive tests often have to be combined to either raise the posttest probability of disease to a level justifying treatment or lower it to a level at which withholding treatment is warranted. Diagnostic algorithms involving clinical assessment; venous ultrasonography; D-dimer testing; ventilation-perfusion lung scanning; and, more recently, computed tomography have been validated in management trials of patients with a suspected pulmonary embolism. The optimal strategy at individual institutions is dependent on local availability, expertise, and cost. Magnetic resonance imaging and combined computed tomographic pulmonary angiography and venography possess the potential to be used as stand-alone tests for pulmonary embolism but require further evaluation."
CD010864,0,20434767,0,Proteases and sFlt-1 release in the human placenta.,"Increased placental release of soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sFlt-1) is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (PE). Although the reason for increased placental sFlt-1 release in PE is unknown, proteolytic effect has been proposed as one of the mechanisms that mediate sFlt-1 release in the placenta. In this study, using various protease inhibitors, we tested the possible role of proteases in sFlt-1 release by human placenta. Villous explants from normal term placentas were incubated with various protease inhibitors including serine protease inhibitors (PMSF, aprotini, and specific chymotrypsin inhibitor (CI)), cysteine protease inhibitor E-64, metalloendopeptidase inhibitor PAD, and universal metalloprotease (ADAM) inhibitor PTM. Culture medium was collected and measured for sFlt-1 by ELISA. Our results showed that villous tissue treated with CI and PTM produced significantly less sFlt-1 than those of controls. PMSF, aprotini, E-64, and PAD had no effect on sFlt-1 release. We further examined chymotrypsin-like protease/chymase and ADAM10 expressions in tissue sections from normal and PE placentas by immunohistochemistry. We found that immunostaining for chymase and ADAM10 was significantly increased in the layer of syncytiotrophoblasts in PE placentas compared to normal placentas. These results suggest chymotrypsin-like serine protease and ADAM10, but not cysteine protease and metalloendopeptidase, may play a role in inducing sFlt-1 release in PE placentas."

CD010864,0,21972999,0,Recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnancy and the postpartum period.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy and the postpartum is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality; yet, there are few robust data from clinical trials to inform an approach to diagnosis and management. Failure to investigate symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism (PE) is a consistent finding in maternal death enquiries, and clinical symptoms should not be relied on to exclude or diagnose VTE. In this consensus statement, we present our recommendations for the diagnosis and management of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE. All women with suspected DVT in pregnancy should be investigated with whole leg compression ultrasonography. If the scan is negative and significant clinical suspicion remains, then further imaging for iliofemoral DVT maybe required. Imaging should be undertaken in all women with suspected PE, as the fetal radiation exposure with both ventilation/perfusion scans and CT pulmonary angiography is within safe limits. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred therapy for acute VTE that occur during pregnancy. In observational cohort studies, using once-daily regimens appears adequate, in particular with the LMWH tinzaparin; however, pharmacokinetic data support twice-daily therapy with other LMWH and is recommended, at least initially, for PE or iliofemoral DVT in pregnancy. Treatment should continue for a minimum duration of six months, and until at least six weeks postpartum. Induction of labour or planned caesarean section maybe required to allow an appropriate transition to unfractionated heparin to avoid delivery in women in therapeutic doses of anticoagulation."
CD010864,0,12080352,0,Use of anti-BDCA-2 antibody for detection of dendritic cells type-2 (DC2) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"TH2-inducing dendritic cells (DC2) are commonly identified as negative for lineage markers and positive for HLA-DR and CD123 expression. More recently, normal blood DC2 were shown also to be positive for BDCA-2 and BDCA-4 antigens. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether BDCA-2 expression on DC2 is impaired in patients undergoing an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and in healthy donors treated with G-CSF for HSC mobilization. Flow cytometry assays for DC2 detection using either a triple staining with anti-HLA-DR PerCP, anti-Lin(+) anti-CD34 FITC and anti-CD123 PE monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), or a double staining with anti-HLA-DR PE and anti-BDCA-2 FITC mAbs were compared in blood samples from patients who underwent an allogeneic HSCT (n = 30) or from healthy donors before (n = 11) and after (n = 8) G-CSF mobilization, as well as in healthy donors' leukapheresis products (n = 12) or bone marrow (n = 4). Staining of BDCA-2(+) cells with other markers such as anti-CD38, anti-CD54 and anti-CD58 were also performed. Median values of CD123(+) DC2 and BDCA-2(+) DC2 were not statistically different in the blood of patients previously treated with chemotherapy, nor in the blood or bone marrow of heathy donors. Also, a 5 day G-CSF treatment did not affect BDCA-2 or adhesion molecule expression on healthy donors' blood DC2 significantly. A correlation between all the results (n = 65) obtained with the two assays was demonstrated in a linear regression curve (r = 0.914) (P = 0.00001). BDCA-2 is a marker highly specific for DC2 that is not downregulated by chemotherapy or G-CSF treatment. Therefore, the anti-BDCA-2 mAb can be efficiently combined with other mAbs and used in studies addressing the role of DC2 in the allogeneic HSCT setting."
CD010864,0,16959687,0,C-reactive protein in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.,"Hypertension is the most frequent medical complication of pregnancy. A recent report demonstrates the flogistic pathogenesis of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Because C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation, it can be used in the differential diagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. A total of 322 pregnant women at 24 to 32 weeks' gestation were enrolled. The control group (A) comprised 190 women. Sixty-three women had preeclampsia (PE, group B), 31 women presented transient hypertension (TH, group C), 19 had HELLP syndrome (HS, group D) and 19 had chronic hypertension (CH, group E). CRP serum concentrations were significantly higher in groups B, C, and D in comparison with the group A. In the whole population, systolic and diastolic pressure value inversely correlate with weight at delivery and weeks of gestation at delivery. CPR levels in patients with PE and HS inversely correlate with birth weight and gestational week at delivery. Normal plasma levels of CRP may be an important marker of differential diagnosis between TH and CH. In TH, PE, and HS, CRP levels were higher than in the control and CH groups, suggesting that inflammation may be the common pathogenetic cause of TH and PE. Finally CRP levels in preeclampsia are believed to correlate with preeclamptic process severity."
CD010864,0,19719034,0,The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is challenging, and autoptic series have demonstrated that a high percentage of cases are not recognized ante-mortem. A number of predisposing factors, symptoms and signs associated with pulmonary embolism have been recognized, and should be used to raise the suspicion of the disease. These include immobilization, recent surgery, active cancer, previous thromboembolism, syncope, dyspnoea, chest pain, haemoptysis, signs of deep vein thrombosis, hypocarbic hypoxemia. Once pulmonary embolism is suspected, the clinical probability of the disease should be assessed; to this end, three clinical rules have been proposed and validated (the revised Geneva score, the Wells score and the PISA-PED score) while others await clinical validation. In case of low clinical probability, a negative a D-dimer test is sufficient to rule out the diagnosis, while if the clinical probability is high, or the D-dimer test is positive, further tests are necessary. Computer tomography angiography or perfusion lung scan are the imaging tests of choice, depending on local availability and experience. If the clinical probability and the results of the imaging test are concordant, a definitive diagnosis can be obtained; if the results are discordant, further testing is necessary. In particular, in the specific case of a small clot (i.e. segmental or subsegmental) incidentally recognized at a computer tomography obtained for other reasons in a patient without a clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism, an occurrence whose frequency is rapidly increasing in clinical practice, a final diagnosis cannot be made without further confirmatory testing."

CD010864,0,8228579,0,Plasma reactivity to hexagonal II phase phosphatidylethanolamine is more frequently associated with lupus anticoagulant than with antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies.,"In membranes, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is usually in a lamellar phase, but it can also adopt a hexagonal II phase (HexII PE), which has been demonstrated to be immunogenic in mice and has recently been used in a new clotting assay to detect lupus anticoagulant (LA). A population of 58 patients susceptible of having LA or antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLA), was screened for reactivity to HexII PE using the new clotting assay and for the presence of anti-PE antibodies (aPEA) using ELISA. The patients could be classified as follows: 26 systemic lupus erythematosus, 14 primary antiphospholipid syndromes and 18 miscellaneous non autoimmune disorders. HexII PE reactivity was detected in 22 patients. It was significantly more often associated with LA-positivity (20/29) than with LA-negativity (2/29), (p < 0.0001). However, 9 patients with LA had negative HexII PE assays. Anti-PE antibodies were detected by ELISA in only 12% of the cases. No correlation was observed between the distribution of aPEA and that of HexII PE reactivity. Interestingly, 2 LA- and aPLA-negative patients exhibited HexII PE reactivity. The absence of identity between the distribution of HexII PE reactivity and that of either LA or aPEA indicates that this new assay has its own specificity. It might detect antibodies to the immunogenic hexagonal PE and may therefore have a broader scope than that proposed initially. Although in the studied populations, no significant relationship could be found between HexII PE positivity and clinical complications (thrombosis and/or recurrent fetal losses), it might be associated with other complications of the antiphospholipid syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Sixteen patients (seven men, mean age: 60+/-7 years) with deep (n = three) and superficial (n = 13) venous thromboses of the lower limbs documented at echo-Doppler study underwent, 24 hours before saphenous vein stripping, a scintigraphic study after IV injection of the 99mTc-MoAb (1,129+/-275 MBq/mL), acquiring dynamic images, as well as early and delayed static images of lower limbs. Tracer activity was compared in normal and pathologic areas. At the operation, vessel wall including the thrombotic lesion was isolated, weighed, and counted. Blood radioactivity and MoAb concentration were also measured. No adverse reaction was observed after MoAb administration. Thrombus site appeared as a focal area (hot spot) of asymmetrically increased tracer uptake, already detectable at early images in all patients. All thrombi detected at echo-Doppler study (n=25) were confirmed at scintigraphic study, which showed four additional hot spots subsequently confirmed to represent thrombi at operation. Average percent ratio between pathologic and normal regions was 1.51+/-1.34 (p < 0.05) at time-activity curves, 2.27+/-1.1 (p < 0.05) at early static images, and 2.15+/-1.2 (p < 0.05) at delayed images, respectively. Thrombus-to-blood uptake ratio was 4.3+/-0.9 (p < 0.01). The F(ab')2 MoAb proved to be safe, and low levels of antimouse antibodies were detected in response, although further studies are needed to assess tolerance and effectiveness in case of a second administration in the same patient. The 99mTc-labeled MoAb was very effective in identifying venous thromboses both at deep and superficial localizations, although its sensitivity and specificity need be evaluated in a more numerous group, including also patients with different and clinically more relevant localizations, such as caval thromboses. However, the possibility of obtaining high-quality images within 4 hours of MoAb administration is clinically relevant, and carries also therapeutic implications, especially in pulmonary thromboembolism."
CD010864,0,10546145,0,[Current status of diagnosis and therapy of acute pulmonary embolism].,"Diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a challenge due to the often confusing clinical presentation of the disease. Plasma D-dimer testing with ELISA is increasingly becoming part of the initial diagnostic work up. Due to the high specificity of the assay, a negative test can reliably exclude PE. Importantly, massive PE can be promptly diagnosed or excluded by echocardiography which is a particularly valuable noninvasive method for detection of right ventricular dysfunction at the bedside. High-risk patients can thus be identified and treated immediately without further time-consuming examinations. Confirmation of PE in patients with inconclusive or normal echocardiograms is often based on lung scans, but diagnostic uncertainty is common with this procedure. The popularity of pulmonary angiography is decreasing due to its invasiveness, whereas spiral CT appears to be a promising alternative. Search for (residual) deep vein thrombosis is useful for guiding therapy in stable patients with small pulmonary emboli, since their risk is determined by the potential for PE recurrence. Recent evidence confirmed that right ventricular dysfunction predicts an unfavorable prognosis and might therefore justify thrombolytic treatment of massive PE regardless of systemic hemodynamics. On the other hand, simplified anticoagulation regimens with low-molecular weight heparins have yielded very promising results in stable patients. These diagnostic and therapeutic principles based on cardiovascular risk stratification will hopefully result in a more effective approach to patients with venous thromboembolism in the future."
CD010864,0,23908470,0,Biomarkers for prediction of venous thromboembolism in cancer.,"Cancer patients are at increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The incidence among different groups of cancer patients varies considerably depending on clinical factors, the most important being tumor entity and stage. Biomarkers have been specifically investigated for their capacity of predicting venous thromboembolism (VTE) during the course of disease. Parameters of blood count analysis (elevated leukocyte and platelet count and decreased hemoglobin) have turned out to be useful in risk prediction. Associations between elevated levels and future VTE have been found for d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2, and soluble P-selectin and also for clotting factor VIII and the thrombin generation potential. The results for tissue factor-bearing microparticles are heterogeneous: an association with occurrence of VTE in pancreatic cancer might be present, whereas in other cancer entities, such as glioblastoma, colorectal, or gastric carcinoma, this could not be confirmed. Risk assessment models were developed that include clinical and laboratory markers. In the high-risk categories, patient groups with up to a >20% VTE rate within 6 months can be identified. A further improvement in risk stratification would allow better identification of patients for primary VTE prevention using indirect or novel direct anticoagulants."

CD010864,0,11132649,0,A new method for measuring D-dimer using immunoturbidometry: a study of 255 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.,"D-Dimer testing has been suggested as a non-invasive method for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In this study, we compared a new method, the Miniquant D-dimer (Biopool International, Ventura, California, USA) to other previously validated D-dimer methods used for the purpose. Patients who were undergoing a definitive diagnostic study for thromboembolism had a blood sample drawn at that time. A whole-blood D-dimer (SimpliRed; Agen Biomedical Ltd, Brisbane, Australia) test was performed, and residual plasma was frozen and later analyzed using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods (D-dimer Gold; Agen, and Asserachrome D-Di; Stago International, Parsippany, New Jersey, USA) and the Miniquant D-dimer. Once all samples were analyzed, the correlation and accuracy of the Miniquant was compared with the ELISA method using Spearman's regression and Dunn's multiple paired comparison. All D-dimer methods were compared with radiographic studies. The data was analyzed collectively and segregated into in-patient (n = 112) and out-patient (n = 143) populations. The Miniquant D-dimer sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) for all patients were 95, 21, and 94% for DVT, and 100, 26, and 100% for PE. This new D-dimer method demonstrates acceptable sensitivity in patients with PE and DVT and, based on the high NPV of this method, it can be used for the exclusion of thromboembolism."

Three hundred and three patients underwent CTPA for acute VTE. A Simplified Wells Score was calculated for 279 subjects, with a mean score of 1.6 +/- 1.6. Twenty CTPA procedures demonstrated VTE, a positive rate of 7.2%, which was lower than expected. This result likely reflects lack of adherence to a clinical algorithm for assessment of VTE and an overly cautious approach to symptom evaluation."
CD010864,0,21432991,0,Reevaluation of quantitative flow cytometric analysis for TLR2 on monocytes using F(ab')2 fragments of monoclonal antibodies.,"In patients with refractory infections, reliable markers that monitor the severity and healing process are needed. The expression level of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on monocytes is such candidate. In the conventional assay system, the whole IgG (wIgG) form of anti-TLR2 mAb has been used with control IgG, which blocks nonantigen-specific bindings. However, the competitive reactions against FcÎ³ receptors (FcÎ³Rs) between labeled anti-TLR2 mAbs and control IgG should be considered. Our goal was to precisely quantify TLR2 expression level on monocytes by flow cytometry (FCM). In this study, we prepared anti-TLR2 mAbs, D45 (IgG2a), and D29 (IgG1), as well as their fragment antigen-binding [F(ab')(2) ] fragments to avoid nonantigen-specific binding to FcÎ³Rs. And then, we determined TLR2 expression levels on monocytes by using these mAbs/fragments and our calibration system using recombinant TLR2 beads. The binding of PE-labeled D45 wIgG to monocytes was completely blocked with unlabeled D45 wIgG, but not with unlabeled D45 F(ab')(2) fragment. Although the nonantigen-specific binding of D29 wIgG to nonstimulated monocytes was negligible, it was enhanced in interleukin-10-stimulated monocytes. It proved difficult to completely block nonantigen-specific binding of D45 and D29 wIgGs by treatment with control IgG. It was demonstrated that the use of fluorescent-labeled antigen-binding region lacking the fragment crystallizable portion of anti-TLR2 mAb [such as the PE-labeled F(ab')(2) fragment] is indispensible for quantification of TLR2 levels on monocytes in flow cytometry. ."
CD010864,0,24020405,0,Evaluation of autologous blood clot subsegmental pulmonary thromboembolism in minimally invasive experimental canine model.,"The incidence and significance of subsegmental pulmonary (SSP) thromboembolism is currently under investigation. We aimed to evaluate the clinical and diagnostic features of SSP thromboembolism in an experimental canine model. Obstruction of pulmonary arterial branches was induced in three beagle dogs by intravenous injection of a barium-coated autologous blood clot (size, approximately 1.7Â ÃÂ 5Â mm). The clinical signs, haemodynamic changes (blood pressure, electrocardiogram, echocardiography), coagulation (aPTT, PT, FDPs and D-dimer test) and cytokine variations (TNF-a, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10) were evaluated over a 24-hour period. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) with contrast was conducted to evaluate the pulmonary obstruction, and histopathological confirmation was performed. Pulmonary artery pressure gradient (PAPG) was increased 12Â h after the autologous blood clot injection (14.2Â Â±Â 2.8Â mmHg to 23.6Â Â±Â 1.7Â mmHg, PÂ =Â 0.003) and normalized 24Â h later (PÂ <Â 0.01). Infused radiopaque clots were confirmed with MDCT and histopathological examination. Pulmonary parenchymal changes such as arterial dilation and inflammatory reactions were also confirmed in histopathological examinations and were barely observable in MDCT. Usually small emboli are not easily detected through CT imaging, and the clinical relevance of these emboli is controversial. In this experimental study, we made radiopaque small emboli and induced SSP thromboembolism. Thus, we infer that obstruction of the small segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries does result in a pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) and PTE-related pulmonary parenchymal changes which could be clinically significant."
CD010864,0,21870867,0,Inhibition of the replication of hepatitis B virus in vitro by pu-erh tea extracts.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most widespread viral infections in the world and poses a significant global public health problem. The implementation of effective vaccination programs has resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of acute hepatitis B. Nevertheless, there is still a need for as many effective anti-HBV drugs as possible. In this study, the role of pu-erh tea extracts (PTE) against HBV was analyzed in vitro by using a stably HBV-transfected cell line HepG2 2.2.15. The MTT assay showed that PTE and its active components (tea polyphenols, theaflavins, and theanine) presented low cytotoxicity. ELISA analysis revealed that PTE effectively reduced the secretion of HBeAg, but any one of the active components alone showed weaker efficacy, suggesting that the anti-HBV activity of PTE might be a synergetic effect of different components. RT-PCR and luciferase assay showed that PTE suppressed HBV mRNA expression while leaving four HBV promoter transcriptional activities unchanged. Fluorescence quantitative PCR results demonstrated that PTE dramatically diminished HBV DNA produced in cell supernatants as well as encapsidated DNA in intracellular core particles.

CD010864,0,22616472,0,A case of pulmonary embolism and stroke in a 16-year-old girl.,"A 16-year-old girl arrived intubated to the emergency department. She had shortness of breath and cough for 2 days with leg pain. On arrival, she was hemodynamically stable with an unremarkable physical exam. Electrocardiogram revealed a prolonged QT interval; laboratory work-up was normal except for an elevated dimerized plasmin fragment D. Acute pulmonary embolism was confirmed by a chest computed tomography scan. A lower extremity duplex scan was negative and echocardiogram revealed a patent foramen ovale with bidirectional shunting. An inferior vena cava filter was placed to prevent acute recurrence and unfractionated heparin was initiated. The next day she was noted to have right hemiparesis. Stroke was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient underwent mechanical clot retrieval and was discharged on anticoagulation therapy to a brain rehabilitation unit."
CD010864,0,21932312,0,The identification of different endothelial cell populations within the mouse proepicardium.,"The proepicardium is a transient embryonic structure that is a source of precursors of the epicardium, coronary smooth muscle cells, and may be a source of coronary endothelial cells (EC). To better understand proepicardium development a systematic analysis of EC appearance was performed. Multiple marker analysis showed that EC are present in the mouse proepicardium at embryonic day (E) 9.0 through E9.75. Distinct populations of EC were found that were associated with the liver bud, and the sinus venosus, as well as a population that do not appear to be associated with either of these structures. There was a temporal increase in the number of EC and temporal changes in the distribution of EC within the different populations during PE development. These findings indicate that EC exist in the proepicardium before coronary vasculogenesis, and support a model in which there is a heterogeneous origin for EC in the proepicardium."

CD010864,0,17155873,0,Synergistic effects of mixed TiAlV and polyethylene wear particles on TNFalpha response in THP-1 macrophages.,"TNFalpha is a potent osteoclastogenic cytokine that has a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of wear particle-induced osteolysis. Wear particles of one composition and their biological effects are well characterised. In contrast, little is known about the effects of mixed particles with respect to mix ratio and particle concentration. We evaluated the effects of different mix ratios of polyethylene and TiAlV particles on TNFalpha response. We used a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) in this in vitro study. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated to macrophage-like cells and exposed to different mixtures of lipopolysaccharide-detoxified polyethylene and TiAlV particles. TNFalpha was analysed in culture supernatants using ELISAs. Both polyethylene and TiAlV particles induced a dose- and time-related release of TNFalpha, with maximum levels after 6 h. A PE/TiAlV mix ratio of 36:1 at 10(8) particles/ml induced significantly higher TNFalpha concentrations compared to equal particle concentrations of isolated TiAlV (p=0.047) or PE (p=0.044), indicating the synergistic effect of mixed particles. These results provide evidence that TiAlV and polyethylene particles have significant synergistic effects, depending on the mix ratio and particle concentrations. This supra-additive effect can contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of implant particle-induced osteolysis."

CD010864,0,15322504,0,Low molecular weight heparin (dalteparin) is equally effective as unfractionated heparin in reducing coagulation activity and perfusion abnormalities during the early treatment of pulmonary embolism.,"Little is known about the differences between unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with regard to their effects on coagulation activity during treatment for pulmonary embolism. The objective of this study was to compare UFH and LMWH (dalteparin) in the early treatment of pulmonary embolism in terms of control of coagulation markers and perfusion abnormalities. Thirty-seven patients with acute pulmonary embolism were randomized to receive intravenous UFH or subcutaneous dalteparin, each accompanied by acenocoumarol. Daily blood samples were obtained for the measurement of thrombin generation (fragments 1 and 2 [F1+2], thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes and fibrin monomers [FMs]) and fibrinolysis (d-dimer concentrations and clot-lysis times). Ventilation-perfusion scintigraphies were performed, and with the data they yielded, percentage of vascular obstruction scores (PVOs) were calculated on days 0 and 5. The international normalized ratio was within the therapeutic range in both groups on day 3. F1+2 and TAT complexes rapidly normalized, without differences between the groups (P =.5 and.4, respectively). FM levels did not decrease and, in fact, showed an increase in the UFH group from day 3 on (P <.05 between groups). d-Dimer levels decreased over time, with no differences between groups (P =.6). Clot-lysis times were shorter in the UFH group (P <.05). PVOs on days 0 and 5 were not different (P =.5 and.8, respectively), but the decrease in PVOs over time was greater in the dalteparin group (P =.04). These results show that dalteparin is at least as effective as UFH in reducing coagulation activity and perfusion abnormalities in the early treatment of pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,16622611,0,Doppler ultrasonography versus venography in the detection of deep vein thrombosis in patients with pulmonary embolism.,"In patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) the frequency of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) varies between 13-93%. The aim of this study was to compare Doppler ultrasonography (DUSG) and venography in the detection of DVT in patients with PE. Fifty-one patients who were clinically diagnosed as having PE from January 1st 2001 to January 31st 2005 were entered into the study and comorbid conditions and risk factors were noted. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed by ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy, spiral tomography and angiotomography while the diagnosis of DVT was made by DUSG and venography. DVT was confirmed by both DUSG and venography in 19 (37,3%) patients. In the remaining 32 patients DUSG was negative. Venography confirmed DVT in 6 of these patients while in 26 no DVT was found. The sensitivity and specifity of DUSG in the diagnosis of DVT were 76% and 100% respectively and the negative and positive predictive values were 81% and 100% respectively. The mean d-dimer concentration was 1,187 in patients with DVT and 641 in patients without DVT (p > 0.05). Aquired risk factors were found in 4 of 6 patients with DVT, CRP was elevated in 5 (83%) and ALT-AST were elevated in 2 (33%). Although DUSG alone is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of DVT, venography still remains the gold standard in the diagnosis of DVT. Especially in patients with PE, where the diagnosis of DVT may increase the success of treatment, venography or other diagnostic tools may be used instead of a second DUSG if the first DUSG is negative."

CD010864,0,20637782,0,Insulin resistance relates to microvascular reactivity 23 years after preeclampsia.,"Preeclampsia, an endothelial disorder of pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk on cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular risk factors may mediate vascular dysfunction both during pregnancy but also later in life. This study aims to investigate microvascular reactivity, and its relationship with several cardiovascular risk factors, in women with a history of preeclampsia and controls. In this cross-sectional study we compared women with a history of preeclampsia (PE, n=22) with women with uneventful pregnancies only (CON, n=29) 23 years after their first delivery. Participants were matched for BMI, age and date of delivery. We assessed blood concentrations of fasting glucose, HbA1c, insulin, (total, HDL-, LDL-) cholesterol, triglycerides and CRP. Endothelial function was assessed by measurement of skin microcirculatory blood flow by Laser Doppler flowmetry at the dorsal and ventral site of the finger during post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH). PE had higher fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR compared with CON. The PORH response was similar in both groups. The area under the curve of PORH correlated with insulin and HOMA-IR at both sites, with BMI, triglycerides at the dorsal site and with CRP at the ventral site of the finger in PE and not in CON. In conclusion, 23 years after pregnancy we did not observe a difference in the microvascular hyperemic response between women with a history of preeclampsia and controls. Meanwhile, the results of our study suggest that insulin resistance and other cardiovascular risk factors are related to microvascular reactivity in middle-aged women with a history of preeclampsia."

CD010864,0,15494686,0,Managing cancer patients with acute venous thromboembolism: exploring safe alternatives to hospitalisation.,"Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and potentially fatal complication that frequently occurs in cancer patients. Few data are currently available about the optimal management of this category of high-risk patients. In clinical practice, physicians have to deal with many problems related to cancer patients with acute VTE. For instance, cancer patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are frequently admitted to the hospital since their high rate of recurrent thrombotic events and/or bleeding-related therapy; however, most of them would prefer alternatives to prolonged hospitalisation. Then, it is not clearly whether data coming from a non-cancer population (such as that regarding the use of D-dimer test and/or pre-test clinical probability [PCP]), can be reliable applied in cancer patients. Finally, scanty information is present on the feasibility of the ""home-treatment program"" for DVT in this category of high-risk patients. In our review we present data on a population of cancer patients evaluated at the Emergency Care in whom we have evaluated: 1) the diagnostic accuracy of PCP and D-dimer test; 2) the safety and efficacy of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) as ""protective anticoagulation"" in case of deferred imaging for VTE and 3) the safety and efficacy of home treatment."

CD010864,0,22716646,0,"microRNA-29b contributes to pre-eclampsia through its effects on apoptosis, invasion and angiogenesis of trophoblast cells.","PE (pre-eclampsia), a pregnancy-specific disorder, is characterized by increased trophoblast cell death and deficient trophoblast invasion and reduced trophoblast-mediated remodelling of spiral arteries. The present study was performed to determine the function of miR-29b (microRNA-29b) in trophoblast cells and its underlying role in the pathogenesis of PE. The prediction of miR-29b target genes was performed using computer-based programs, including Targetscan, Pictar and miRBase. The function of these target genes was analysed further by gene ontology (GO). The effects of miR-29b on apoptosis, and invasion and angiogenesis of trophoblast cell lines (HTR-8/SVneo, BeWo and JAR) were examined by flow cytometry and Matrigel assay respectively. We found that miR-29b induced apoptosis and inhibited invasion and angiogenesis of trophoblast cells. Further studies confirmed that miR-29b regulated the expression of MCL1 (myeloid cell leukaemia sequence 1), MMP2 (encoding matrix metallproteinase 2), VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A) and ITGB1 (integrin Î²1) genes by directly binding to their 3'-UTRs (untranslated regions). Moreover, we identified that there was an inverse correlation between miR-29b and its target genes in subjects with PE. Taken together, these findings support a novel role for miR-29b in invasion, apoptosis and angiogenesis of trophoblast cells, and miR-29b may become a new potential therapeutic target for PE."
CD010864,0,19371759,0,Effects of adrenergic agents on the expression of zebrafish (Danio rerio) vitellogenin Ao1.,"Teleost vitellogenins (VTGs) are large multidomain apolipoproteins, traditionally considered to be estrogen-responsive precursors of the major egg yolk proteins, expressed and synthesized mainly in hepatic tissue. The inducibility of VTGs has made them one of the most frequently used in vivo and in vitro biomarkers of exposure to estrogen-active substances. A significant level of zebrafish vtgAo1, a major estrogen responsive form, has been unexpectedly found in heart tissue in our present studies. Our studies on zebrafish cardiomyopathy, caused by adrenergic agonist treatment, suggest a similar protective function of the cardiac expressed vtgAo1. We hypothesize that its function is to unload surplus intracellular lipids in cardiomyocytes for ""reverse triglyceride transportation"" similar to that found in lipid transport proteins in mammals. Our results also demonstrated that zebrafish vtgAo1 mRNA expression in heart can be suppressed by both alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (PE) and beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO). Furthermore, the strong stimulation of zebrafish vtgAo1 expression in plasma induced by the beta-adrenergic antagonist, MOXIsylyl, was detected by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). Such stimulation cannot be suppressed by taMOXIfen, an antagonist to estrogen receptors. Thus, our present data indicate that the production of teleost VTG in vivo can be regulated not only by estrogenic agents, but by adrenergic signals as well."
CD010864,0,7974393,0,Diagnostic and prognostic value of fibrinopeptides in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism.,"To determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of fibrinopeptides in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), we made a pilot study in the Emergency Department with a general ICU. 32 patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism were the participants and 16 cases were diagnosed as PE-positive. After the diagnosis of PE, thrombolytic therapy with urokinase was administered, followed by heparin therapy. Plasma fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and fibrinopeptide B beta 15-42 (FPB beta 15-42) were measured before treatment and at 1, 2 and 6 days after treatment. In the PE-positive patients, the levels of both fibrinopeptides measured prior to the treatment were above the normal values, and were significantly higher than those of PE-negative patients. When the cutoff points of FPA and, FPB beta 15-42 were set at 15 ng/ml, 15 ng/ml respectively, both markers had a high sensitivity, a highly negative predictive value and a moderate specificity. Six of the PE-positive patients died. The FPB beta 15-42 levels were significantly lower in the survivors than those in the patients who died at 2 days (p = 0.0092) and 6 days (p = 0.0011). We can conclude that: 1) the fibrinopeptide measured in this study are useful for screening for PE; and 2) FPB beta 15-42 may possibly be useful as a method for predicting the clinical outcome of PE."

CD010864,0,15222648,0,DVT and pulmonary embolism: Part I. Diagnosis.,"The incidence of venous thromboembolic diseases is increasing as the U.S. population ages. At least one established risk factor is present in approximately 75 percent of patients who develop these diseases. Hospitalized patients and nursing home residents account for one half of all cases of deep venous thrombosis. A well-validated clinical prediction rule can be used for risk stratification of patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis. Used in combination with D-dimer or Doppler ultrasound tests, the prediction rule can reduce the need for contrast venography, as well as the likelihood of false-positive or false-negative test results. The inclusion of helical computed tomographic venography (i.e., a below-the-pelvis component) in pulmonary embolism protocols remains under evaluation. Specific combinations of a clinical prediction rule, ventilation-perfusion scanning, and D-dimer testing can rule out pulmonary embolism without an invasive or expensive investigation. A clinical prediction rule for pulmonary embolism is most helpful when it is used with subsequent evaluations such as ventilation-perfusion scanning, D-dimer testing, or computed tomography. Technologic advances are improving the resolution of helical computed tomography to allow detection of smaller emboli; however, further study is needed to provide definitive evidence supporting the role of this imaging technique in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. D-dimer testing is helpful clinically only when the result is negative. A negative D-dimer test can be used in combination with a clinical decision rule, ventilation-perfusion scanning, and/or helical computed tomography to lower the probability of pulmonary embolism to the point that aggressive treatment is not required. Evidence-based algorithms help guide the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism."

CD010864,0,7781279,0,The antiphospholipid and thrombosis (APL-T) syndromes. Clinical and laboratory correlates.,"Anticardiolipin antibodies and the lupus anticoagulant are strongly associated with thrombosis and appear to be the most common of the acquired blood protein defects causing thrombosis. Although the precise mechanisms by which antiphospholipid antibodies alter hemostasis to induce a hypercoagulable state remain unclear, several theories have been advanced. The most common thrombotic events associated with anticardiolipin antibodies are deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus (type I syndrome), coronary or peripheral artery thrombosis (type II syndrome), or cerebrovascular-retinal vessel thrombosis (type III syndrome); occasionally, patients present with mixtures (type IV syndrome). The relative frequency of anticardiolipin antibodies in association with arterial and venous thrombosis strongly suggests that these should be looked for in any individual with unexplained thrombosis; all three idiotypes (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be measured. Also, the type of syndrome (I through V) should be defined, if possible, as this may dictate both the type and duration of both immediate and long-term anticoagulant therapy. Unlike patients with anticardiolipin antibodies, patients with primary lupus anticoagulant thrombosis syndrome usually sustain venous thrombosis. Because the aPTT is unreliable in patients with lupus anticoagulant (prolonged in approximately 40% to 50% of patients) and is seldom prolonged in patients with anticardiolipin antibodies, definitive tests (ELISA for anticardiolipin antibodies and the dRVVT for lupus anticoagulant) should be immediately ordered when antiphospholipid syndrome is suspected or when individuals present with otherwise unexplained thrombotic or thromboembolic events."
CD010864,0,18766269,0,A multicenter evaluation of a new quantitative highly sensitive D-dimer assay for exclusion of venous thromboembolism.,"D-dimer testing is widely applied for exclusion of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). We report on a multicenter performance evaluation of a new particle-enhanced immunoassay, Innovance D-Dimer. Innovance D-Dimer assay was performed in 1,543 frozen samples from outpatients suspected of DVT and/or PE enrolled in three management studies as well as in a routine clinical practice. Samples were assayed on BCS/BCS XP, BCT as well as Sysmex CA-7000, CA-1500 and CA-560 analyzers (cut-off on all analyzers: 0.5 mg/l). Stratus CS D-Dimer and Vidas D-Dimer Exclusion were used for comparison. The precision study indicated total coefficients of variation ranging from 2.1% to 8.4% depending on the analyzer and on the sample. Sensitivity and negative predictive values were above 99% and their lower 95% confidence interval were equal or above 97.4% and 98.6%, respectively. Specificity ranged from 38.2% to 40.4% and the respective lower 95% confidence intervals from 35.5% to 37.7%. Area under the curve was 0.90 for all assay systems except for Innovance D-Dimer with BCT (0.89). Two samples from patients with distal DVT tested negative with all assay systems. One patient with high pre-test clinical probability and proximal DVT tested negative with Vidas D-Dimer Exclusion. Our data indicate that the performances of Innovance D-Dimer, regardless of the analyzer, are similar to the reference methods, and that this assay can be used for the exclusion of venous thromboembolic disease."
CD010864,0,22007254,0,Macrophage migration inhibitory factor in fetoplacental tissues from preeclamptic pregnancies with or without fetal growth restriction.,"The proinflammatory cytokine MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor) is involved in physiological and pathological processes in pregnancy. MIF maternal serum levels are increased in preeclampsia (PE). We hypothesize that pregnancy tissues are the source of MIF overexpression in PE. MIF protein was studied in maternal sera, placental tissues, fetal membranes, and umbilical cord of 8 control and 20âPE pregnancies: 10 with normal fetal growth (PE-AGA) and 10 with fetal growth restriction (PE-FGR). MIF levels were significantly higher in PE-AGA membranes than in controls and PE-FGR. In PE-FGR, MIF cord concentrations were higher than in PE-AGA while MIF placental levels were lower than in controls. MIF maternal serum levels were higher in PE, compared to controls, and the difference was mainly due to PE-FGR samples. These data support MIF involvement in PE pathogenesis and suggest that different pregnancy tissues contribute to MIF production in PE with and without fetoplacental compromise."
CD010864,0,23195705,0,Discovery of candidate phospholipid biomarkers in human lipoproteins with coronary artery disease by flow field-flow fractionation and nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"In this study, an analytical method is demonstrated to identify and develop potential phospholipid (PL) biomarkers of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) in plasma from individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD) by employing a combination of off-line multiplexed hollow fiber flow field-flow fractionation (MxHF5) and nanoflow liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-ESI-MS-MS). HDL and LDL particles of human plasma were sorted by size at a semi-preparative scale using MxHF5, after which PL extracts of each lipoprotein fraction were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by nLC-ESI-MS-MS. Experiments were performed using plasma samples from 10 CAD patients and 10 controls. Quantitative analysis of the 93 PL species identified yielded a selection of 19 species from HDL fractions and 10 from LDL fractions exhibiting at least a five fold change in average concentration in CAD patients. Among the selected species, only a few were found exclusively in patient HDL fractions (18:3-LPA and 20:2/16:0-PG), control HDL fractions (16:0/16:1-PC, 20:1/20:4-PE, and 16:1-LPA), and control LDL fractions (16:0/22:3-PG). Moreover, 16:1/18:2-PC was detected from both HDL and LDL fractions of controls but disappeared in CAD patients. Although the typical change in lipoproteins for CAD is well known, with decreased levels of HDLs and reduced LDL particle size, the current study provides fundamental information on the molecular level of lipoprotein variation which can be utilized for diagnostic and therapeutic tracking."

CD010864,0,9516139,0,c-kit is expressed in soft tissue sarcoma of neuroectodermic origin and its ligand prevents apoptosis of neoplastic cells.,"During development, mice with mutations of stem cell factor (SCF) or its receptor c-kit exhibit defects in melanogenesis, as well as hematopoiesis and gonadogenesis. Consequently, accumulating evidence suggests that the c-kit/SCF system plays a crucial role in all of these processes and in tumors which derive from them. Especially in neuroblastoma (infant tumors of neuroectoderm crest derivation such as melanocytes) it would appear that an autocrine loop exists between c-kit and SCF, and that the functional block of the c-kit receptors with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) results in a significant decrease in cellular proliferation. We studied the expression and role of c-kit and SCF in cell lines of soft tissue sarcoma of neuroectodermic origin, such as Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuro-ectodermal tumors (PNET). Using flow cytometry with MoAb CD117 PE, c-kit expression was highlighted in all six of the cell lines examined. This receptor was specifically and functionally activated by SCF, as shown by the binding experiments and the intracellular phosphotyrosine and immunoprecipitation studies that were performed. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis, five of the six cellular lines expressed the mRNA of SCF. In the medium measured by using an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay, low concentrations of SCF were found: only the TC32 cellular line produced significantly higher levels (32 pg) than control. In serum-free culture the addition of SCF reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells from 25% to 90% in five out of the six cellular lines. This observation was confirmed by (1) the functional block of c-kit with MoAb: after 7 days of culture more than 30% of the cells were apoptotic (range 31.5% to 100%) in five out of six cell lines and there was also a decrease in the percentage of cells in phase S, and (2) c-kit antisense oligonucleotides: in the cellular lines treated with oligonucleotides (in relation to the untreated lines) there was a notable reduction (P < .001) both in the absolute number of cells and the 3H-thymidine uptake. These results indicate that ES and PNET express c-kit and its ligand SCF and that SCF is capable of protecting the tumor cells against apoptosis. Furthermore, the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed on the biopsies revealed the presence of mRNA both of SCF and c-kit in practically all of the samples studied. Our in vitro data lead us to assume that SCF may also inhibit tumor cell apoptosis in vivo."

Based on a conjoint diagnostic refer, ence standard, including ventilation-perfusion lung scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography, the prevalence of pulmonary embolism was 31%. We demonstrated a high sensitivity (98%, 95% CI 95-100) and negative predictive value (94%, 95% CI 79-99) for the combination of the two tests. These figures were more favorable than for either test alone. The specificity of the combination was lower (11%, 95% CI 9-12) and consequently the proportion of patients in whom further diagnostic tests would have been avoided was only 8%. We conclude that the combined use of the SimpliRED test and the clinical probability estimate attains a higher sensitivity than either test alone. However, there remains a risk of false negatives and the exclusion efficiency is limited."

Regardless of the age of presentation, PE shortens life expectancy. Paradoxically, as survival of patients has been prolonged as a result of the use of antiretroviral therapy, the prevalence of PE has increased. Therefore, a predictive marker of PE emergence is critical. The objective of this study was to determine in an observational study whether any immunologic (CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocyte counts, monocyte counts) or virologic (viral load [VL], biological characteristics of viral isolates) marker might be predictive of PE and whether any particular marker may be involved in the timing of clinical onset of PE."

CD010864,0,21792181,0,The development of a novel cancer immunotherapeutic platform using tumor-targeting mesenchymal stem cells and a protein vaccine.,"An ideal anticancer strategy should target only the malignant cells but spare the normal ones. In this regard, we established a platform, consisting of an antigen-delivering vehicle and a protein vaccine, for developing an immunotherapeutic approach with the potential for eliminating various cancer types. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated capable of targeting tumors and integrating into the stroma. Moreover, we have developed a protein vaccine PE(ÎIII)-E7-KDEL3 which specifically recognized E7 antigen and elicited immunity against cervical cancer. Taking advantage of tumor-homing property of MSCs and PE(ÎIII)-E7-KDEL3, we used E6/E7-immortalized human MSCs (KP-hMSCs) as an E7 antigen-delivering vehicle to test if this protein vaccine could effectively eliminate non-E7-expressing tumor cells. Animals which received combined treatment of KP-hMSCs and PE(ÎIII)-E7-KDEL3 demonstrated a significant inhibition of tumor growth and lung-metastasis when compared to PE(ÎIII)-E7-KDEL3 only and KP-hMSCs only groups. The efficiency of tumor suppression correlated positively to the specific immune response induced by PE(ÎIII)-E7-KDEL3. In addition, this combined treatment inhibited tumor growth via inducing apoptosis. Our findings indicated that KP-hMSCs could be used as a tumor-targeting device and mediate antitumor effect of PE(ÎIII)-E7-KDEL3. We believe this strategy could serve as a platform for developing a universal vaccine for different cancer types."

CD010864,0,23357159,0,Neurologic diseases of the central nervous system with pathophysiologically relevant autoantibodies--perspectives for immunoadsorption.,"Immediate antibody elimination, pulsed induction of antibody redistribution, and immunomodulation are major forces of efficacy of therapeutic apheresis (i.e. plasma exchange [PE] or immunoadsorption [IA]) for autoimmune neurologic disorders. Therapeutic apheresis can offer rapid response for severe acute neurologic symptoms, and stable rehabilitation in long-term clinical courses being refractory to drug based strategies or complicated by drug side effects. PE or IA in these situations must be considered as part of multimodal or escalating immune treatment strategies in combination or in competition with intravenously administered immunoglobulins (ivIg), corticosteroids, the full spectrum of immunosuppressive drugs, and bioengineered antibodies. Selective IA is increasingly replacing PE due to its superior safety profile and increasing knowledge on pathogenic relevance of autoantibodies. Recent experiences in autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system, e.g. multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and autoimmune encephalitis confirmed this concept."
CD010864,0,12430899,0,Effects of hormone replacement therapy on coagulation and fibrinolysis in postmenopausal women.,"It has been speculated that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) containing relatively low dose of estrogen would be different from oral contraceptive pills in causing thromboembolism because activation of coagulation depends on the amount of estrogen. In contrast to this knowledge, activation of coagulation pathways has been detected in postmenopausal women treated with HRT in the observational and clinical studies. In this regard, recent studies have reported a 2 to approximately 4 fold risk of venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism in postmenopausal women receiving HRT than in non-users of estrogen. On the other hands, HRT has shown to enhance systemic fibrinolysis with decreased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels. In addition, levels of D-dimer exhibited a significant inverse correlation with PAI-1 levels, suggesting enhanced fibrinolysis potential. However, small doses of estrogen/progestogen induce increases in fibrinolytic capacity via a marked reduction of PAI-1. In other words, HRT at conventional dosages may affect fibrinolytic activity to a greater extent than coagulation activity, whereas the converse trend holds at higher estrogen doses. The increase in fibrinolytic potential was independent of any effect on coagulation of CEE at conventional dosages. However, in contrast to healthy postmenopausal women, we recently reported that HRT did not significantly decrease PAI-1 antigen levels and rather, increased tissue factor activity and prothrombin fragment F(1+2) levels from baseline in hypertensive and/or overweight postmenopausal women. Activation of coagulation following HRT may not be balanced by activation of fibrinolysis in some postmenopausal women. Thrombogenic events are considered more likely in patients with certain heritable conditions, such as platelet antigen-2 (PIA-2) polymorphisms. Further, Factor V Leiden mutation increases the risk of primary and recurrent venous thromboembolic events by three to sixfold and the risk of myocardial infarction. Indeed, HRT may decrease or increase atherothrombosis risk depending on the presence of Factor V Leiden mutation. Thus, HRT should not be initiated in women with established coronary artery disease or the coexistence of other risk factors for hypercoagulability-malignancy, immobility, obesity, diabetes, advanced age, or inherited traits. However, HRT at conventional dosages improves fibrinolysis potential in healthy postmenopausal women."

CD010864,0,18586684,0,Hyperhomocysteinemia due to pernicious anemia leading to pulmonary thromboembolism in a heterozygous mutation carrier.,"Pulmonary thromboembolism is a life-threatening condition resulting mostly from lower extremity deep-vein or pelvic-vein thrombosis. A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with pain on the right side of the chest and hemoptysis. On laboratory analysis, D-dimer level was elevated. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography revealed intravascular filling defects due to thrombi in right lower lobe pulmonary segmental arteries. Screening for thrombophilic states was normal except for heterozygous mutations of both prothrombin and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677) genes. Homocysteine level was high, and vitamin B12 level and serum ferritin level were reduced. Serum antiparietal antibody was positive, and therefore, pernicious anemia was diagnosed along with iron-deficiency anemia. After the diagnoses were established, enoxaparin followed by warfarin was started in addition to oral vitamin B12, pyridoxine, thiamine, folic acid, and ferroglycine sulfate supplementation. At the end of 8 weeks of the replacement therapy, vitamin B12, folate, and homocysteine levels and red cell volume were found to be normal, with complete resolution of the thrombus confirmed by repeat computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. We conclude that hyperhomocysteinemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency associated with pernicious anemia might have decreased the threshold for thrombosis. In addition, the presence of heterozygous prothrombin and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase mutations might serve as synergistic cofactors triggering pulmonary thromboembolism."

Mean plasma concentrations of both FbDP and FgDP were significantly elevated in patients with thrombotic disease as compared with healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of FgDP were positively correlated with FbDP (r = 0.667, P less than 0.001). When analysed according to the disease categories, the magnitude of elevations of FbDP and FgDP was most prominent in venous thrombotic disease such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. These findings indicate that fibrinolysis is accelerated in patients with thrombotic disease and that fibrinolysis is frequently accompanied by some fibrinogenolysis in these patients."

CD010864,0,1486657,0,Dextran sulfate-dependent fusion of liposomes containing cationic stearylamine.,"The incorporation of the positively charged stearylamine into phosphatidylcholine liposomes was studied by measuring electrophoretic mobilities. Up to a molar ratio SA/PC = 0.5 an increase of the positive zeta potential can be observed. Addition of the negatively charged macromolecule dextran sulfate leads to a change of the sign of the surface potential of the PC/SA liposomes indicating binding of the macromolecule to the surface. This process is accompanied by an increase in turbidity, which is dependent on the molecular weight of the dextran sulfate and the SA concentration (measured by turbidimetry). Using the NBD/Rh and Pyr-PC fluorescence assays the fusion of SA containing liposomes was investigated. A strong influence of the SA content and molecular weight of dextran sulfate on the fusion extent was observed. The fusion extent is proportional to the SA content in the PC membrane and the molecular weight of dextran sulfate. PC/SA/PE liposomes exhibit a higher fusion extent after addition of dextran sulfate compared to PC/SA liposomes indicating that PE additionally destabilizes the bilayer. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy reveals that the reaction products are large complexes composed of multilamellar stacks of tightly packed, straight membranes and aggregated vesicles. The tight packing of the membranes in the stacks (and the narrow contact of the aggregated vesicles) indicates a strong adherence of opposite membrane surfaces induced by dextran sulfate."

CD010864,0,24093839,0,Measurement of natriuretic peptides at the point of care in the emergency and ambulatory setting: current status and future perspectives.,"The measurement of natriuretic peptides (NPs), B-type NP or N-terminal pro-B-type NP, can be an important tool in the diagnosis of acute heart failure in patients presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) with acute dyspnea, according to international guidelines. Studies and subsequent meta-analyses are mixed on the absolute value of routine NP assessment of ED patients. However, levels of NPs are likely to be used also to guide treatment and to assess risk of adverse outcomes in other patients at risk of developing heart failure, including those with pulmonary embolism or diabetes, or receiving chemotherapy. Natriuretic peptide levels, like other biomarkers, can now be measured at the point of care (POC). We have reviewed the current status of NP measurement together with the potential contribution of POC measurement of NPs to clinical care delivery in the emergency and other settings. Several POC systems for measuring NP levels are now available: these produce test results within 15 minutes and appear sufficiently sensitive and robust to be used routinely in diagnostic evaluations. Point-of-care systems could be used to assess NP levels in the ED and community outpatient settings to monitor the risk of acute heart failure. Furthermore, the use of protocol-driven POC testing of NP within the time frame of a patient consultation in the ED may facilitate and accelerate the throughput and disposition of at-risk patients. Appropriately designed clinical trials will be needed to confirm these potential benefits. It is also important that processes of care delivery are redesigned to take full advantage of the faster turnaround times provided by POC technology."

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and latex agglutination immunoassay technologies are currently most widely used, while Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCIÂ®) and other chemiluminescence-based immunoassays are emerging technologies for the coagulation laboratory. However, not all immunoassay technologies employed are compatible with the workflow requirements of the coagulation laboratory, and, not all technologies are suitable for detection or quantification of every marker.

CD010864,0,16267786,0,Investigation of general and cytoskeletal markers to estimate numbers and proportions of neurons in the human intestine.,"An important requirement in pathological diagnostics in the human enteric nervous system (ENS) is the estimation of the total numbers of neurons and of proportions of distinct subpopulations. In this study, we compared the suitability of two suggested panneuronal markers, cuprolinic blue (CB) and anti-Hu-protein (HU), for staining and counting human myenteric neurons in wholemounts, derived from small and large intestinal samples. Furthermore, the proportional expression of three cytoskeletal intermediate filaments, alpha-internexin (IN), neurofilament 200 (NF) and peripherin (PE), was correlated with both CB and HU. In 8 CB- and HU-stained wholemounts, 93.3% of all neurons were double labeled, 3.3% of neurons were stained only with CB whereas 3.3% were immuno-stained only for HU. Thus, both markers were comparably reliable in representing the putative total human myenteric neuron population in our material. The wholemounts double stained for IN/CB or IN/HU revealed between 56.2 and 71.5% of neurons to be IN-reactive. Between 42.8 and 50.9% of neurons were immunoreactive for NF whereas 53.9 to 62.4% of neurons were reactive for PE. Although our sample number was too small to allow final conclusions, we suggest that the variations in proportions of intermediate filament expression we observed may be due to individual circumstances rather than to correlation with age or region. The proportions of neurons positive for IN, NF or PE but unstained by CB histochemical or HU immunohistochemical techniques was between 0 and 2.2%. We conclude that both CB and HU techniques are suitable methods for representation of almost all myenteric neurons in the human gut and that the differential expression of the cytoskeletal proteins investigated has to be included in the classification of enteric neurons in pathological diagnostics of human gastrointestinal diseases."

We hypothesize that ST2 would be increased at presentation in ED chest pain patients with myocardial ischemia, thus allowing for the early identification of acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and 30-day adverse cardiovascular events, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) for each outcome of greater than 0.7."
CD010864,0,19836839,0,Novel approaches for mechanistic understanding and predicting preeclampsia.,"Despite intense investigation, preeclampsia (PE) remains largely enigmatic. Relatively late onset of diagnostic signs and heterogeneous nature of the disease further contribute to poor understanding of its etiology and clinical management. There exist no concrete animal models that can provide mechanistic underpinnings for evaluating targeted therapeutic intervention. Poor cross-sectional findings with potential biochemical markers reported so far have proved counterintuitive and suggest a need for novel approaches to predict the early onset of disease. Because of the co-onset of local placental anomalies and systemic manifestation of symptoms, it is highly likely that serum from PE patients can provide a ""blueprint"" of causative factors. Proteomic and/or functional analysis of maternal serum are expected to predict the onset of disease ahead of manifestation of clinical symptoms. A serum-based predictive assay should overcome complexities resulting from the heterogeneous etiology of PE. This review attempts to address some of these issues and discuss the signature biochemical serum factors and propose new and better ways to predict PE."
CD010864,0,1315073,0,[The changes in molecular markers for hemostatic activation after t-PA therapy in case of pulmonary embolism].,"We observed the changes of molecular markers for hemostatic activation in a patient with acute pulmonary embolism treated with 2 x 10(7) unit tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Blood samples were obtained before, just after, at 30 min, 1, 2, 6, and 24 hours after the infusion. Molecular markers included thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), plasminogen-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), and thrombomodulin (TM). Marked elevation of TAT was observed from immediately after the t-PA infusion to 6 hours after, although it had been observed for only 1 hour in our previous report on the cases of acute myocardial infarction. PIC level was significantly increased during t-PA infusion but returned to almost baseline value 6 hours after the end of t-PA infusion. This finding was almost the same as the one previously reported concerning acute myocardial infarction cases. TM level increased throughout the evaluation, and remained so, even on the 7th day after t-PA infusion. Our present data revealed a clear difference between the reactive TAT increases after t-PA therapy in acute myocardial infarction cases and in acute pulmonary embolism cases. Our present data also revealed a prolonged elevation of TM during the acute period of pulmonary embolism. It is therefore necessary to keep an eye on the changes of molecular markers for hemostatic activation after t-PA therapy in acute pulmonary embolism."

The Ig classes (IgM, IgG, and IgA) were captured using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Ig-capture ELISA). The antibody specificity of the captured Ig was confirmed by binding of NDV. After inoculation with live virus, antibodies of the IgG and IgM classes were mainly found in serum. IgM was produced early from day 4 postexposure (PE) onward, IgG was detected later from day 7 PE onward, and in the tracheal wash fluid and bile, all three Ig classes were demonstrated. After inoculation of inactivated virus, a delayed response of all three classes was observed in serum, and only IgM and IgG were recognized in the tracheal fluid and bile. The type of vaccine and the mute of antigen entrance may have determined the immunoglobulin class produced. The Ig-capture ELISA assay developed in this study can be useful for evaluating various strategies to improve the efficacy of Newcastle disease vaccines and to study the evoked immune mechanisms."
CD010864,0,23002110,0,The maternal HLA-G 1597ÎC null mutation is associated with increased risk of pre-eclampsia and reduced HLA-G expression during pregnancy in African-American women.,"The non-classical major histocompatibility complex molecule, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G, is thought to contribute to maternal immune tolerance and successful placentation during pregnancy. Genetic polymorphisms in HLA-G are known to influence expression levels as well as the relative expression of individual protein isoforms. As diminished or aberrant HLA-G expression patterns may contribute to the development of certain pregnancy complications, we sought to investigate the association between functional HLA-G polymorphisms and the risk of pre-eclampsia (PE) in African-American women. The association between maternal and fetal genotype at six HLA-G polymorphisms and risk of PE was assessed in 372 pregnancies (314 normotensive; 58 pre-eclamptic). We observed an elevated risk of PE (P = 0.00027) in pregnancies where the mother carried the 1597ÎC allele, a null allele that abolishes expression of full-length HLA-G isoforms. Furthermore, the frequency of the maternal 1597ÎC allele was highest in the subset of pre-eclamptic pregnancies that were delivered preterm, suggesting an association between the null allele and the severity of PE. We then replicated the association between higher maternal 1597ÎC allele frequency and increased severity of PE (P = 0.038) in an independent sample of 533 African-American women. Finally, to investigate the mechanistic basis of this association, we measured circulating soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) concentrations in maternal serum collected during pregnancy in 51 healthy, normotensive African-American control women and found significantly lower levels in women carrying the 1597ÎC allele (P = 0.012). These results demonstrate that maternal HLA-G genotype is significantly associated with risk of PE in African-American women and is predictive of circulating sHLA-G levels during pregnancy."

Consensus and controversies.,"Venous thrombotic events (VTE) occur 1-2 per 10,000 pregnancies and remain one of the leading causes of maternal mortality in the developed world. The two largest risk factors are a personal history of VTE and heritable thrombophilias. D-dimer tests for VTE in pregnancy have a high false positive rate and at least some false negatives have been reported. Compression ultrasound should be used to evaluate pregnant women for deep venous thrombosis followed by magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis for a negative test and strong remaining clinical suspicion. For pulmonary embolism, a chest x-ray should be used to triage the patient to either a ventilation/perfusion study after a normal X-ray or a CT pulmonary angiogram after an abnormal one. Treatment generally consists of low molecular weight heparin through a minimum of six weeks post-partum. Thombolysis might have merit in life-threatening, massive pulmonary embolism. VTE prophylaxis in at-risk populations remains a major area of uncertainty. Mechanical prophylaxis for all women undergoing cesarean, in particular, has a paucity of supportive evidence."

CD010864,0,23034829,0,The diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious and potentially fatal medical condition. Correct diagnosis and early treatment of VTE with anticoagulant drugs are critical steps in preventing further complications and recurrence. Evidence suggests that patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) should be managed with a diagnostic strategy that includes clinical pretest probability assessment, D-dimer test, and imaging. Clinical probability scoring, complemented by selective D-dimer testing, has become the recommended strategy for diagnosis. The reason is that overwhelming evidence suggests that patients with suspected VTE are better managed with a diagnostic strategy. If diagnostic algorithms are followed correctly, the chances of adverse events are extremely low (< 1%) in patients in whom VTE has been ruled out, whereas incomplete strategies leads to an increased risk of recurrent VTE or death. This review focuses on the application of diagnostic strategies with suspected DVT or PE into daily clinical practice while discussing the benefits and disadvantages of different approaches."

The proportion of diagnoses that are made on the basis of a positive CTV scan in patients with a negative multislice CT angiography scan, however, is 14% on average. The diagnostic yield of CTV and of compression ultrasound could be increased by their select use in patients who are likely to have deep-vein thrombosis. Radiation exposure from CTV can be reduced by eliminating imaging of the pelvic veins and by obtaining discontinuous axial images of the proximal leg veins. There are several valid reasons for recommending or not recommending leg studies in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, and the choice of diagnostic tests should be individualized on a patient-by-patient basis."

Data was obtained from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC 1986), including 9,362 pregnancies and subsequent births between 1985 and 1986. Pregnancies were categorised into three groups: (1) GH with blood pressure (BP) â¥ 140/90 mmHg, (2) PE with BP â¥ 140/90 mmHg and proteinuria, and (3) reference group with normal BP. The final study population included 331 offspring of mothers with GH, 197 with PE and 5,045 offspring of normotensive mothers. The main outcome measures were systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), body mass index (BMI), and serum lipid, glucose and insulin levels of the 16 year-old offspring. The children of mothers with GH had higher BP compared to the reference group (SBP percentage difference 2.7 (95% CI 1.6, 3.8); DBP 3.4 (2.1, 4.6); MAP 3.1 (2.0, 4.1), P < 0.001 for all) and a tendency towards higher cholesterol and apolipoprotein B values. The offspring of mothers with PE had higher DBP and MAP, however after the adjustments this difference disappeared. Maternal de novo hypertension during pregnancy is associated with offspring's elevated blood pressure level already in adolescence. GH may also be associated with unfavourable lipid profile of the offspring."

Lupus anticoagulant (LA), antibodies directed against beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) and antibodies against both beta 2GPI and a mixture of phospholipids (cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid) (APAs) were measured. The patients were followed-up (mean 4.9 years) to determine the time to the next VTE. We found LA in nine patients, anti-beta 2GPI antibodies in seven patients and APAs in six patients. The cumulative risk of recurring VTE was higher in patients with beta 2GPI-binding antibodies (hazard ratio 12.6, 95% CI 1.5-104.9; p = 0.0029). The risk associated with APAs was 11.5 (95% CI 1.3-98.9; p = 0.0049) and that for LA was 3.7 (95% CI 0.9-15.6; p = 0.055).

We studied this in a large population-based nested case-cohort study of 508 VT cases and 1464 matched control subjects from a cohort of 66,140 participants in the Health Study of Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag in Norway. Venous thrombosis was validated using standardized criteria for venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Prethrombotic serum anticardiolipin antibodies were measured by an enzyme-linked immunoassay. There was no association between elevated anticardiolipin antibody levels and subsequent venous thrombosis, overall or after stratification by sex, different age groups or idiopathic vs. secondary thrombosis. The overall odds ratio was 1.11 (95% CI: 0.71-1.74) for greater than vs. less than the 95th percentile of anticardiolipin antibody levels.

CD010864,0,16725175,0,The effects of changing water flow velocity on the formation of biofilms and water quality in pilot distribution system consisting of copper or polyethylene pipes.,"We studied the effects of flow velocity on the formation of biofilms and the concentration of bacteria in water in copper and plastic (polyethylene, PE) pipes. The formation of biofilms increased with the flow velocity of water. The increase in microbial numbers and contents of ATP was clearer in the PE pipes than in the copper pipes. This was also seen as increased consumption of microbial nutrients in the pipeline system. This indicates that the mass transfer of nutrients is in major role in the growth of biofilms. However, the increased biomass of biofilms did not affect microbial numbers in the water. Rapid changes in water flow rate resuspended biofilms and sediments which increased the concentrations of bacteria and copper in water. The disturbance caused by the changing water flow was also seen as an increase in the particle counts and water turbidity recorded with online instrumentation."

CD010864,0,2457525,0,The role of cell interactions in the differentiation of teratocarcinoma-derived parietal and visceral endoderm.,"Cell interactions have been implicated in the differentiation of visceral and parietal endoderm in the developing mouse embryo. Embryoid bodies formed from F9 embryonal carcinoma cells have been useful in characterizing the events which lead to endoderm formation. As part of our effort to specify the interactions which may be involved in this process we have isolated visceral endoderm-like cells (VE) from F9 embryoid bodies and cultured them under various conditions. Using a combination of immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we demonstrate that monolayer culture of these cells on a number of different substrates leads to a dramatic decrease in the level of alphafetoprotein (AFP), a VE-specific marker. Northern blot analysis of AFP mRNA indicates very low levels of this message are present after 48 hr in monolayer culture. Coincident with the drop in AFP levels is an increase in the levels of the cytokeratin Endo C and tissue plasminogen activator, both markers for parietal endoderm (PE). Morphological evidence at the ultrastructural level supports a transition from VE to PE. In contrast, the VE phenotype can be maintained in vitro by interaction with aggregates, but not monolayers, of stem cells. In addition, culturing the cells on the curved surface of gelatin-coated dextran beads, but not on a flat gelatin surface facilitates AFP expression and the cells are morphologically intermediate between VE and PE cells. The potential role of junctional complexes and cell shape are discussed."
CD010864,0,19664147,0,CD3 expression distinguishes two gammadeltaT cell receptor subsets with different phenotype and effector function in tuberculous pleurisy.,"Tuberculous pleurisy is a naturally occurring site of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Herein, we describe the expression of activation, natural killer (NK) and cell migration markers, as well as effector functions from gammadeltaT cells in peripheral blood (PB) and pleural effusion (PE) from tuberculosis patients (TB). We observed a decreased percentage of circulating gammadeltaT from TB patients and differential expression of NK as well as of chemokine receptors on PB and PE. Two subsets of gammadeltaT cells were differentiated by the CD3/gammadeltaT cell receptor (gammadeltaTCR) complex. The gammadeltaTCR(low) subset had a higher CD3 to TCR ratio and was enriched in Vdelta2(+) cells, whereas most Vdelta1(+) cells belonged to the gammadeltaTCR(high) subset. In PB from TB, most gammadeltaTCR(high) were CD45RA(+)CCR7(-) and gammadeltaTCR(low) were CD45RA(+/-)CCR7(+)CXCR3(+). In the pleural space the proportion of CD45RA(-)CCR7(+)CXCR3(+) cells was higher. Neither spontaneous nor Mtb-induced interferon (IFN)-gamma production was observed in PB-gammadeltaT cells from TB; however, PE-gammadeltaT cells showed a strong response. Both PB- and PE-gammadelta T cells expressed surface CD107a upon stimulation with Mtb. Notably, PE-gammadeltaTCR(low) cells were the most potent effector cells. Thus, gammadeltaT cells from PB would acquire a further activated phenotype within the site of Mtb infection and exert full effector functions. As gammadeltaT cells produce IFN-gamma within the pleural space, they would be expected to play a beneficial role in tuberculous pleurisy by helping to maintain a T helper type 1 profile."

CD010864,0,19712840,0,The use of D-dimer in specific clinical conditions: a narrative review.,"The use of D-dimer in combination with a clinical decision rule has been widely investigated in pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis. Although it has been shown to be safe in excluding venous thromboembolism, the clinician is often faced with specific situations in which the use of D-dimer is controversial. We review the best available evidence on these patients. We conclude that it is not safe to use D-dimer testing in patients with symptoms of a venous thromboembolism for over 14 days, patients receiving therapeutic heparin treatment and patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis during oral anticoagulant therapy. In these populations the levels of D-dimer can be lower then expected giving rise to false-negative results. It is safe to use D-dimer testing in combination with a clinical decision rule in patients of all ages, patients presenting with a suspected recurrent venous thromboembolism or inpatients with suspected pulmonary embolism. As patients with recurrent venous thromboembolism, elderly patients and inpatients have higher levels of D-dimer, D-dimer testing has a low specificity and the need for additional radiological testing is increased."

Physical examination revealed tachypnoea, tachycardia and slight abdominal tenderness. Laboratory investigations revealed hypoxaemia and a strongly elevated D-dimer level. Thorax radiography revealed no abnormalities and no indications for pulmonary embolism were revealed by the CT. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes. Shortly after admission and despite resuscitation the patient died. Autopsy revealed massive pulmonary tumour embolism that originated from a primary lymphogenic metastasized coecum carcinoma. Pulmonary tumour embolism is characterised by tumour cells in the pulmonary vascular system, which exhibit no continuity with parenchymal metastases. Due to the less than specific findings revealed by history taking, physical examination and additional tests, the condition is rarely diagnosed ante mortem."

Of the 423 patients >50 years old who underwent CTPA, 22 (5.2%) had D-dimer concentrations higher than the traditional threshold but lower than the age-adjust threshold, none of whom had evidence of PTE on CTPA. This suggests that use of the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold may reduce necessity for CTPA concept patients aged >50 years."
CD010864,0,11130837,0,Current perspectives The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. A review of the literature and current clinical practice.,"The optimal approach to the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is still controversial. The poor sensitivity and specificity of most of the clinical manifestations, the suboptimal accuracy of the majority of the laboratory and instrumental examinations and the highly variable local availability of the diagnostic resources, makes it in fact difficult for a univocal strategy to be adopted. Recently published practical guidelines, however, support the use of lung scanning (either ventilation/perfusion or only perfusion) as a first-line imaging test, since this approach allows for a correct diagnosis in most patients, after careful history taking, physical examination and electrocardiogram, chest X-ray and arterial blood gas analysis performance. When lung scanning is non-diagnostic, either serial non-invasive (i.e. ultrasonographic) evaluation of the lower limbs or pulmonary angiography should follow. Growing evidence is accumulating on the use of spiral computed tomography scanning either as an alternative or as a complement to lung scanning, while echocardiography should be reserved for the bedside evaluation of critically ill patients, when more validated techniques are not readily available. The role of plasma D-dimer measurement has yet to be defined, especially in hospitalized patients. In current clinical practice, however, these recommendations seem to be only partially followed. Depending in fact on the different characteristics of the populations examined in the seven available studies reporting on this issue, the use of the different diagnostic techniques appears highly variable. Although a standard diagnostic pathway does not seem applicable to all patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism, further work is nonetheless needed in order to identify in different patient subsets the diagnostic approach capable of minimizing the use of diagnostic resources while obtaining the greatest amount of information."

CD010864,0,22494827,0,Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.,"Pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause of death from cardiovascular disease after heart attack and stroke. Sequelae occurring after venous thromboembolism include chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and post-thrombotic syndrome. Venous thromboembolism and atherothrombosis share common risk factors and the common pathophysiological characteristics of inflammation, hypercoagulability, and endothelial injury. Clinical probability assessment helps to identify patients with low clinical probability for whom the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism can be excluded solely with a negative result from a plasma D-dimer test. The diagnosis is usually confirmed with compression ultrasound showing deep vein thrombosis or with chest CT showing pulmonary embolism. Most patients with venous thromboembolism will respond to anticoagulation, which is the foundation of treatment. Patients with pulmonary embolism should undergo risk stratification to establish whether they will benefit from the addition of advanced treatment, such as thrombolysis or embolectomy. Several novel oral anticoagulant drugs are in development. These drugs, which could replace vitamin K antagonists and heparins in many patients, are prescribed in fixed doses and do not need any coagulation monitoring in the laboratory. Although rigorous clinical trials have reported the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological prevention with low, fixed doses of anticoagulant drugs, prophylaxis remains underused in patients admitted to hospital at moderate risk and high risk for venous thromboembolism.

It has been reported that right ventricular overload and hypoxia in acute pulmonary embolism may lead to right ventricular myocardium injury reflected by elevated cardiac troponin levels and that in patients with acute central sub-massive or non-massive pulmonary embolism, even mild increase in troponin I >0.03 mug/L may provide relevant short-term prognostic information independent to clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic data. It has also been reported that patients with acute small pulmonary embolism might present with relatively low concentrations of D-dimer and it might have implications regarding the diagnostic yield of D-dimer in patients who are suspected of having an acute pulmonary embolism. We present a case of abnormal troponin I levels without abnormal concentrations of D-dimer at admission in a 26-year-old Italian man with acute pulmonary embolism.

After reducing the heparin dose, the patient developed a new pulmonary embolism and a large thrombus in the right atrium. Concomitantly, the platelet count dropped to a value of 29 g/l. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was confirmed by a functional assay, the heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA) assay, whereas the results of a platelet factor 4/heparin complex ELISA were repeatedly negative. This indicated that the patient's HIT antibodies were directed towards an antigen other than platelet factor 4/heparin complexes. For treatment of the atrial thrombus, an ultra-low-dose lysis with rt-PA (2 mg/h, intravenously) was administered for a period of 52 h, overlapping with systemic treatment with recombinant hirudin (Lepirudin, Refludan, 0.06-0.14 mg/kg/h intravenously).

CD010864,0,14664206,0,Plasma D-dimer for the diagnosis of thromboembolic disorders in dogs.,"D-dimer is formed during thrombus formation when factor XIIIa crosslinks the terminal D-domains of fibrin. The D-dimer epitope is exposed when the thrombus is lysed by plasmin. Thus, D-dimer represents both thrombin and plasmin activation and is specific for fibrinolysis. D-dimer concentrations are increased in dogs with DIC or other thromboembolic disorders, but because D-dimer is an indicator of physiologic or pathologic fibrinolysis, values are elevated in other conditions associated with fibrinolysis, including orthopedic surgery, neoplasia, and internal hemorrhage. It can be used as an ancillary test for the diagnosis of DIC but is not recommended as a sole test for this purpose. D-dimer has the potential to be a useful laboratory test for the detection of pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriate applications for this test in veterinary patients to aid in clinical decision making, treatment, and patient care."

CD010864,0,15940491,0,[Management of pulmonary embolism].,"Venous thromboembolism is often triggered by transient episodes of increased risk but may occur spontaneously in patients with permanently increased risk. Pulmonary embolism may cause impairment of respiratory and circulatory function which can vary in severity from silent to catastrophic. The diagnosis can be feasibly established by detecting vein thrombosis. If this approach fails, demonstration of pulmonary emboli by lung scans becomes necessary to establish the diagnosis. A D-dimer-test can select patients in whom imaging of pulmonary perfusion is required. Immediate therapeutic anticoagulation with heparins is mandatory in confirmed thromboembolism, and is followed by a vitamin K antagonist. In the initial work-up, patients also have to be evaluated for systemic thrombolytic therapy by hemodynamic parameters and echocardiography. In a triggered episode of venous thromboembolism, duration of anticoagulation is confined to several months while spontaneous or recurrent events require prolonged or indefinite treatment."
CD010864,0,17721783,0,The CIMT-monitoring panel: a two-step approach to harmonize the enumeration of antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes by structural and functional assays.,"The interpretation of the results obtained from immunomonitoring of clinical trials is a difficult task due to the variety of methods and protocols available to detect vaccine-specific T-cell responses. This heterogeneity as well as the lack of standards has led to significant scepticism towards published results. In February 2005, a working group was therefore founded under the aegis of the Association for Immunotherapy of Cancer (""CIMT"") in order to compare techniques and protocols applied for the enumeration of antigen-specific T-cell responses. Here we present the results from two consecutive phases of an international inter-laboratory testing project referred to as the ""CIMT monitoring panel"". A total of 13 centers from six European countries participated in the study in which pre-tested PBMC samples, synthetic peptides and PE-conjugated HLA-tetramers were prepared centrally and distributed to participants. All were asked to determine the number of antigen-specific T-cells in each sample using tetramer staining and one functional assay. The results of the first testing round revealed that the total number of cells analyzed was the most important determinant for the sensitive detection of antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cells by tetramer staining. Analysis by ELISPOT was influenced by a combination of cell number and a resting phase after thawing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Therefore, the experiments were repeated in a second phase but now the participants were asked to change their protocols according to the new guidelines distilled from the results of the first phase. The recommendations improved the number of antigen-specific T-cell responses that were detected and decreased the variability between the laboratories. We conclude that a two-step approach in inter-laboratory testing allows the identification of distinct variables that influence the sensitivity of different T-cell assays and to formally show that a defined correction to the protocols successfully increases the sensitivity and reduces the inter-center variability. Such ""two-step"" inter-laboratory projects could define rational bases for accepted international guidelines and thereby lead to the harmonization of the techniques used for immune monitoring."

Serum visfatin and uterine artery PI were measured at 11(+0)-13(+6) weeks in 80 cases that developed PE and 240 unaffected controls. The median visfatin and uterine artery PI multiple of the unaffected median (MoM) in the outcome groups was compared and the significance of the association between visfatin MoM and uterine artery PI MoM, birth weight percentile and gestation at delivery was determined. In the PE group, compared with controls, there was a significantly higher median visfatin MoM (1.35, interquartile range (IQR): 0.69-2.16 vs 1.00, IQR: 0.55-1.96, P=0.027) and uterine artery PI MoM (1.19, IQR: 0.95-1.44 vs 1.03, IQR: 0.83-1.22, P<0.0001). In the PE group, there was no significant association between serum visfatin MoM and uterine artery PI MoM (P=0.589), gestation at delivery (P=0.763) or birth weight percentile (P=0.646). Serum visfatin levels at 11-13 weeks are increased in women who develop PE by a mechanism unrelated to impaired placental perfusion."

The diagnosis of AVTE was confirmed in 50% of the patients, all of whom underwent gold standard invasive investigation i.e. pulmonary angiography and/or contrast venography. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value of a D-dimers plasma concentration exceeding 500 ng/ml for the diagnosis of AVTE were respectively 98, 58, 97 and 70% when using the ELISA method, and 86, 71, 84 and 75% when using the latex assay. In 47 patients whose lung scans yielded abnormalities of indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism, the sensitivity of the ELISA method was very high (94%), but that of latex assay was low (67%). Our results demonstrate that measuring the plasma D-dimers by the latex assay should not be used in the diagnosis of AVTE. On the other hand, the ELISA method might be of great interest in the diagnostic strategy of AVTE, as a normal concentration of D-dimers rules out almost definitely the diagnosis of AVTE, and hence, spares from performing invasive investigations."

CD010864,0,17364892,0,Chemokine transport across human vascular endothelial cells.,"Leukocyte migration across vascular endothelium is mediated by chemokines that are either synthesized by the endothelium or transferred across the endothelium from the tissue. The mechanism of transfer of two chemokines, CXCL10 (interferon gamma-inducible protein [IP]-10) and CCL2 (macrophage chemotactic protein [MCP]-1), was compared across dermal and lung microvessel endothelium and saphenous vein endothelium. The rate of transfer depended on both the type of endothelium and the chemokine. The permeability coefficient (Pe) for CCL2 movement across saphenous vein was twice the value for dermal endothelium and four times that for lung endothelium. In contrast, the Pe value for CXCL10 was lower for saphenous vein endothelium than the other endothelia. The differences in transfer rate between endothelia was not related to variation in paracellular permeability using a paracellular tracer, inulin, and immunoelectron microscopy showed that CXCL10 was transferred from the basal membrane in a vesicular compartment, before distribution to the apical membrane. Although all three endothelia expressed high levels of the receptor for CXCL10 (CXCR3), the transfer was not readily saturable and did not appear to be receptor dependent. After 30 min, the chemokine started to be reinternalized from the apical membrane in clathrin-coated vesicles. The data suggest a model for chemokine transcytosis, with a separate pathway for clearance of the apical surface."
CD010864,0,10726049,0,Exclusion and diagnosis of pulmonary embolism by a rapid ELISA D-dimer test and noninvasive imaging techniques within the context of a clinical model.,"A negative rapid ELISA D-dimer test alone in out-patients with a low to moderate clinical probability (CP) on pulmonary embolism (PE) is predicted to safely exclude pulmonary embolism. The combination of a negative rapid ELISA D-dimer test and a low to moderate CP on PE followed by compression ultrasonography (CUS) for the detection of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is safe and cost-effective as it reduces the need for noninvasive imaging techniques to about 50% to 60% of outpatients with suspected PE. A high probability ventilation-perfusion (VP) scan or a positive spiral CT consistent with PE and the detection of DVT by CUS are currently considered to be clear indications for anticoagulant treatment. Subsequent pulmonary angiography (PA) is the gold standard diagnostic strategy to exclude or diagnose PE in suspected outpatients with a negative CUS, a positive rapid ELISA D-dimer test, and a nondiagnostic VP scan or negative spiral CT to prevent overtreatment with anticoagulants. However, the willingness of clinicians and the availability of resources to perform PA is restricted, a fact that has provided an impetus for clinical investigators to search for alternative noninvasive strategies to exclude or detect venous thromboembolism (VTE). Serial CUS testing for the detection of DVT in patients with a low to moderate CP on PE and a nondiagnostic VP scan or negative spiral CT is predicted to be safe and will reduce the need for PA to less than 10% or even less than 5%. This noninvasive serial CUS strategy restricts the need for invasive PA to a minor group of patients (< 5%) with the combination of a low CP on PE and high probability VP scan or the combination of a nondiagnostic VP scan or negative spiral CT and a high CP on PE. Prospective evaluations are warranted to implement and to validate the advantages and the disadvantages of the various combinations of noninvasive strategies and to compare serial CUS testing versus PA in randomized clinical management studies of outpatients with suspected pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,11567660,0,Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common, lethal yet treatable disease. The clinical diagnosis of PE remains to be a problem due to the nonspecific presenting signs, symptoms, electrocardiographic findings, arterial blood gas abnormalities and chest X-ray changes. Despite these nonspecific clinical findings, clinicians are adept at assigning pretest probability using overall clinical assessment. Clinical models have been developed to improve the accuracy of pretest probability assessment. D-dimers are becoming a widely available clinical tool useful in the diagnostic management of suspected PE. The limitations of the imaging modalities for PE [ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning, spiral computerised tomography, pulmonary angiography and venous leg imaging] necessitate the use of these tests in series and in combination with clinical pretest probability assessment and D-dimer in diagnostic management algorithms. These algorithms permit safe diagnostic management of patients with suspected PE while limiting invasiveness, inaccessibility and expense."
CD010864,0,12942280,0,Value of negative spiral CT angiography in patients with suspected acute PE: analysis of PE occurrence and outcome.,"The aim of this study was to analyze pulmonary embolism (PE) occurrence and retrospective clinical outcome in patients with clinically suspected acute PE and a negative spiral CT angiography (SCTA) of the pulmonary arteries. Within a 35-month period, 485 consecutive patients with clinical symptoms of acute PE underwent SCTA of the pulmonary arteries. Patients with a negative SCTA and without anticoagulation treatment were followed-up and formed the study group. Patient outcome and recurrence of PE was evaluated retrospectively during a period of 6 months after the initial SCTA, and included a review of computerized patient records, and interviews with physicians and patients. Patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire concerning all relevant questions about their medical history and clinical course during the follow-up period. Special attention was focused on symptoms indicating recurrent PE, as well as later confirmation and therapy of PE. Of the 485 patients, 325 patients (67%) had a negative scan, 134 (27.6%) had radiological signs of PE, and 26 (5.4%) had an indeterminant result. Of 325 patients with a negative scan, 269 (83%) were available for follow-up. The main reasons for loss to follow-up were change of address, name, or phone number, or non-resident patients who left abroad. Of 269 patients available for follow-up, 49 patients (18.2% of 269) received anticoagulant treatment because of prior or recent deep venous thrombosis (32.6%) or a history of PE (34.7%), cardiovascular disease (18.4%), high clinical probability (8.2%), positive ventilation-perfusion scan (4.2%), and elevated D-dimer test (2%). The remaining 220 patients, who did not receive anticoagulant medication, formed the study group. Of this study group, 1 patient died from myocardial infarction 6 weeks after the initial SCTA, and the postmortem examination also detected multiple peripheral emboli in both lungs ( p=0.45%; 0.01-2.5, 95% confidence interval). The PE did not occur in any other patient. In patients with suspected PE and negative SCTA without anticoagulant therapy, the risk of recurrent PE in this study was less than 1% and similar to that in patients after a negative pulmonary angiogram. Therefore, we conclude that patients can be managed safely without anticoagulation therapy; however, this approach may not be appropriate for critically ill patients and those with persistent high clinical suspicion of acute PE."

CD010864,0,12069341,0,Colonization of ion-modified polyethylene with vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro.,"Polyethylene (PE) foils were implanted with 40 and 150 keV Ar+ ions to the fluences from 1 x 10(13) to 1 x 10(15) cm(-2). Production of conjugated double bonds, characterizing degradation of the PE surface layer, was studied using UV-VIS spectroscopy. Wettability of the PE surface, determined by conventional goniometric techniques, was shown to be an increasing function of both ion energy and fluence. It was also increased after exposure of PE to serum-supplemented cell culture media. Cell culture experiments showed that the ion irradiation significantly increased the adherence of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and their subsequent growth on the PE surface. On day 1 after seeding, the number of initially adhered VSMC exhibited two maxima. On day 3 after seeding. these maxima disappeared, which was partially due to a significantly shorter doubling time of VSMC. On the other ion-modified samples. the doubling time did not differ significantly from that on the unmodified PE. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed increased concentration of talin, a protein of focal adhesion plaques, and alpha-actin, a marker of VSMC differentiation, in cells on ion-implanted surfaces. It can be concluded that the ion irradiation supports the adhesion and differentiation of VSMC without excessive proliferation of these cells."

To define the role of HRG, plasma titers were measured by single radial immunodiffusion in eleven patients with thromboembolism before and after streptokinase (SK) therapy and were found unchanged (84.7 +/- 6.2%, M +/- SEM before, and 99.5 +/- 6.3% after 12 hr of SK therapy). The HRG peaks on crossed immunoelectrophoresis before and after SK infusion were also unchanged. Alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor fell during SK infusion as measured immunologically (102.0 +/- 15.0% before and 28.0 +/- 1.6% after 12 hr of therapy) and fibrinogen-fibrin degradative products appeared (mean titer of 1:2,048 after 12 hr of therapy), indicating that the infused SK was biologically active. Plasminogen levels before therapy were normal, as measured functionally and immunologically (105.4 +/- 4.9% and 96.0 +/- 5.6%, respectively), and both decreased after 12 hr of SK therapy (15.2 +/- 5.6% and 50.8 +/- 4.3%). No changes in functional antithrombin III titer, Hageman factor antigen level, or fibrinogen concentration, as measured turbidimetrically, were observed. Thus, although these data do not allow one to make any firm conclusions regarding the physiologic role of this protein in fibrinolysis, they do not exclude its increased catabolism, compensated by increased production, in patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy."

In this study, we evaluated a new assay system based on chemiluminescence EIA (CLEIA) on a fully automated analyzer. Both plasma and serum samples were used, and the master calibration method was applied, eliminating the need for a standard curve preparation. The assay time was shortened to less than 1 hour. Good correlations were observed between this assay and conventional assay kits, y = 1.094x-6.849, r = 0.986 using 326 samples, and between serum and plasma y = 0.997x-1.211, r = 0.997 using 225 paired samples. In addition, the alteration of KL-6 concentration in patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment resulted in similar results that with conventional kits, and elevated KL-6 concentrations were observed in samples from patients with interstitial pneumonia. These results underscore the usefulness of this new assay kit as a rapid test, particularly for the medical examination of outpatients and the treatment of emergency cases in the acute phase of interstitial pneumonia."

We earlier described a PPE family member, Rv2430c, as an immunodominant antigen. We now report another PPE family gene, Rv2608, a member of the major polymorphic tandem repeat subfamily, for its ability to elicit a high humoral and a low T cell response. Rv2608 was also found to be polymorphic in different clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, as determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis. A total of 51 clinically confirmed patients with tuberculosis (TB), belonging to 3 different categories--fresh infection (n=22), relapsed infection (n=21), and extrapulmonary infection (n=8)--and 10 healthy control subjects were included in the study. Recombinant Rv2608 protein showed positive reactivity to patients' serum samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and T cell-proliferation assays with synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted regions of high antigenicity showed a predominantly humoral response in patients with relapsed TB.

Although 98 orthopedic patients including those receiving total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) were treated with 1.5Â mg of Fondaparinux for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Sixteen patients developed DVT, but none was associated with a fatal pulmonary embolism. There was a wide range of anti-Xa activity, but there were no patients with less than 0.15Â mg/l or more than 0.90Â mg/l. Anti-Xa activity gradually increased from days 1 to 8 and showed no significant difference between patients with and without DVT. Anti-Xa activity was correlated with weight, height, body mass index, and antithrombin activity. Postoperative plasma levels of D: -dimer and soluble fibrin (SF) were markedly high, and those were significantly reduced at days 1 and 4 of treatment with Fondaparinux. Plasma levels of SF were significantly reduced at days 8 and 15, but D: -dimer was not. These findings suggested that there was continued thrombin generation after the injection of Fondaparinux until day 8 and secondary fibrinolysis occurred on day 8. In conclusion, 1.5Â mg of Fondaparinux may not be sufficient for the prophylaxis of silent DVT, but it was found to be useful for that of fatal pulmonary embolism. Consequently, monitoring anti-Xa activity may be unnecessary for the administration of Fondaparinux at such doses."

Vice versa, below-threshold marker concentrations allow to virtually exclude significant left ventricular dysfunction in symptomatic patients. Furthermore, BNP and NT-proBNP are predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure, but also in acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and other cardiovascular diseases. The markers therefore appear suitable for additional risk stratification. Independently from the clinical application, however, it is important to note that extracardiac variables may affect marker concentrations and need to be considered when marker concentrations are interpreted. Due to their diagnostic and prognostic value, the cardiac markers BNP and NT-proBNP have a clear potential to further improve the care of patients with cardiovascular diseases."
CD010864,0,11463608,0,Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and pulmonary vascular resistance in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.,"The pathogenesis of severe pulmonary hypertension seems to be related to inflammatory response in diseased sites. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been reported to play a role in the development of congestive heart failure. In this immunological response, activation and migration of leukocytes including macrophages to the inflammatory region are important factors. We hypothesized that the severity of pulmonary hypertension may be related to MCP-1, which is thought to be upregulated by blood pressure or shear stress in pulmonary vasculature as well as by immunological and inflammatory reactions in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Circulating levels of MCP-1, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured by sandwich ELISA in 14 patients with CTEPH. The plasma level of MCP-1 was significantly correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance. In IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, on the other hand, there was no correlation between cytokines and pulmonary hemodynamics. Pathological specimens obtained from the patients with CTEPH undergoing thromboendarterectomy demonstrated immunoreactivity of MCP-1 in endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages within neointima in the hypertensive large elastic pulmonary artery. We conclude that MCP-1 is upregulated in the remodeling of pulmonary arteries in close association with increased pulmonary vascular resistance in CTEPH."

Placental VEGF mRNA expression levels were significantly reduced in the late-onset preeclamptic group compared with the normotensives. The placental mRNA expression of AT1 receptor in the late-onset pre-eclamptic group was relatively raised compared to the normotensives, suggesting hypersensitivity to pressor agents. We believe that the excess of serum sFlt-1 and reduced VEGF and PlGF levels favour an anti-angiogenic state and endothelial dysfunction leading to PE, and that the aetiology and pathogenesis of early- and late-onset PE differ."

CD010864,0,11000546,0,Specific binding of sterically stabilized anti-B-cell immunoliposomes and cytotoxicity of entrapped doxorubicin.,"Administration of doxorubicin (DXR) formulated in sterically stabilized liposomes, (SL) containing engrafted poly(ethylene glycol)-modified phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) on their surface, has been shown to increase the therapeutic index of the drug. A further improvement could be achieved through targeting of liposome-entrapped drug selectively to cancer cells. This paper describes the conjugation of the anti-B-cell lymphoma monoclonal antibody LL2 to the surface of DXR-loaded liposomes by use of a PEG-based heterobifunctional coupling agent. Competitive-binding ELISA of the resulting immunoliposomes (SIL) against the monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody, WN, indicated preserved immunological activity. The pH-sensitive probe, HPTS was used to study the binding of liposomes with target cells. The results showed a 3.8-fold increased cellular association of SIL compared to that of SL and an apparent internalization of SIL into low pH compartments. Addition of an excess of unconjugated free LL2 displaced about 72% of the HPTS-SIL association with cells. Experiments with 125I-labeled free and SIL-bound LL2 showed approximately 50% degradation for both preparations. In vitro MTT cytotoxicity tests against neoplastic B cells gave IC(50) values of 1.6, 2.9 and 0.35 microM for DXR-SIL, DXR-SL and free DXR, respectively. Leakage of drug from the liposomes apparently reduced the specificity of the cytotoxic action of DXR-SIL."

CD010864,0,23062219,0,PTX3 as a potential endothelial dysfunction biomarker for severity of preeclampsia and IUGR.,"Endothelial dysfunction typical of preeclampsia (PE) is the result of an excessive maternal inflammatory response to pregnancy. We investigated PTX3 in maternal, fetal and placental compartments in complicated pregnancies. Maternal blood samples were collected during the third trimester in 53 PE, 43 IUGR (intrauterine growth restriction) and 50 normal pregnancies. Fetal samples were collected from the umbilical vein in 26 PE, 23 IUGR and 26 normal pregnancies at elective cesarean section. Pattern and site of expression of PTX3 were studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on placenta, decidual bed and maternal peritoneum. PE and IUGR pregnancies had significantly higher maternal PTX3 levels compared to normal pregnancies, with IUGR significantly lower than PE. Maternal peritoneum expressed a significantly higher signal in the endothelium of pathological compared to normal pregnancies. The maternal increase of PTX3 correlated with the severity of disease with higher PTX3 concentrations in severe PE. Increased PTX3 levels in PE and IUGR mothers, together with IHC data represent the expression of altered endothelial function on the maternal side. IUGR fetuses had higher PTX3 values than controls and the increase was related to IUGR severity, likely reflecting the hypoxic environment. These data confirm the relevance of PTX3 in support the hypothesis that PE is a disease associated with altered maternal endothelial function. The PTX3 increase in IUGR fetuses deserves further investigation."
CD010864,0,10741102,0,Requirements for appropriate evaluation of diagnostic tests in suspected pulmonary embolism.,"In contrast to the development of new drugs, strict guidelines for the development of new diagnostic methods do not exist. A diagnostic test can be made available without proper evaluation of its clinical utility, which can lead to its premature introduction and inappropriate use. In this review suggestions are made regarding the criteria that should be met during the various phases of development of new diagnostic techniques. It is suggested that a new diagnostic test should only be implemented in routine clinical use after all phases of development have been properly performed with good results. Several diagnostic tests for pulmonary embolism (pulmonary angiography, ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, D-dimer assays, and spiral computed tomography), and the studies evaluating them, are thereafter reviewed. It is concluded that present pulmonary angiography and ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy are the only properly evaluated diagnostic tests for pulmonary embolism. Although new developments, such as D-dimer assays and the spiral computed tomographic scan are certainly promising, further studies are needed to determine their real value and safety in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,18452470,0,Triage patients with suspected pulmonary embolism in the emergency department using a portable ultrasound device.,"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is difficult, despite validated diagnostic models. We sought to determine the value of a portable ultrasound device for triage of patients with suspected PE referred to the emergency department, using simplified echo criteria. We prospectively studied 103 consecutive patients with suspected PE, referred to our emergency department. After D-dimer screening, 76 patients were prospectively enrolled in this ultrasound study and underwent helical chest tomography, transthoracic echocardiography, and venous ultrasonography. Among patients with PE (n = 31), a right ventricular dilation was detected in 17 patients (55%), a direct visualization of clot in the lower limbs was present in 18 patients (58%), and 8 patients (26%) had both right ventricular dilation and deep venous thrombosis. The sensitivity and specificity of a combined ultrasound strategy using echocardiography and venous ultrasonography were respectively 87% (95% confidence interval 74% to 96%), and 69% (95% confidence interval 53% to 82%). The sensitivity of this combined strategy was significantly improved as compared to venous ultrasonography alone (P = 0.01) or echocardiography alone (P = 0.005). In patients with dyspnea or with high clinical probability of PE, this combined strategy was particularly relevant with high sensitivities (respectively 94% and 100%). Echocardiography combined with venous ultrasonography using a portable ultrasound device is a reliable method for screening patients with suspected PE referred to an emergency department, especially in patients with dyspnea or with high clinical probability."
CD010864,0,21881122,0,Haemophilus influenzae protein E binds to the extracellular matrix by concurrently interacting with laminin and vitronectin.,"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) causes otitis media and is commonly found in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Adhesins are important for bacterial attachment and colonization. Protein E (PE) is a recently characterized ubiquitous 16 kDa adhesin with vitronectin-binding capacity that results in increased survival in serum. In addition to PE, NTHi utilizes Haemophilus adhesion protein (Hap) that binds to the basement-membrane glycoprotein laminin. We show that most clinical isolates bind laminin and that both Hap and PE are crucial for the NTHi-dependent interaction with laminin as revealed with different mutants. The laminin-binding region is located at the N-terminus of PE, and PE binds to the heparin-binding C-terminal globular domain of laminin. PE simultaneously attracts vitronectin and laminin at separate binding sites, proving the multifunctional nature of the adhesin. This previously unknown PE-dependent interaction with laminin may contribute to NTHi colonization, particularly in smokers with COPD."

Therefore, we investigated how continuous traffic-related air pollution exposure affects haemostasis parameters in young and old mice. Young (10 weeks) and old (20 months) mice were placed in an urban roadside tunnel or in a clean environment for 25 or 26 days and markers of inflammation and endothelial cells or blood platelet activation were measured, respectively. Plasma microvesicles and pro/anticoagulant factors were analysed, and thrombin generation analysis was performed. Despite elevated macrophage carbon load, tunnel mice showed no overt pulmonary or systemic inflammation, yet manifested reduced pulmonary thrombomudulin expression and elevated endothelial von Willebrand factor (VWF) expression in lung capillaries. In young mice, soluble P-selectin (sP-sel) increased with exposure and correlated with soluble E-selectin and VWF. Baseline plasma factor VIII (FVIII), sP-sel and VWF were higher in old mice, but did not pronouncedly increase further with exposure. Traffic-related air pollution markedly raised red blood cell and blood platelet numbers in young and old mice and procoagulant blood platelet-derived microvesicle numbers in old animals. Changes in coagulation factors and thrombin generation were mild or absent. Hence, continuous traffic-related air pollution did not trigger overt lung inflammation, yet modified pulmonary endothelial cell function and enhanced platelet activity. In old mice, subchronic exposure to polluted air raised platelet numbers, VWF, sP-sel and microvesicles to the highest values presently recorded, collectively substantiating a further elevation of thrombogenicity, already high at old age."

Two non-invasive tools exclude PE with a negative predictive value of > 99%: a normal perfusion lung scan and a normal rapid ELISA VIDAS D-dimer test. The positive predictive value of a high probability ventilation-perfusion lung scan (VP-scan) is only 85% to 87%. The combination of a low clinical score and a non-diagnostic VP-scan safely exclude PE without the need of angiography. The prevalence of PE and that of an alternative diagnosis in symptomatic patients with a non-diagnostic VP-scan are 10% to 20% and 30% to 45%, respectively. Helical spiral computed tomography (CT) detects all clinically relevant PE and a large number of alternative diagnoses in symptomatic patients with a non-diagnostic or high probability VP-scan. The positive predictive value of the spiral CT is > 95%. Single-slice helical CT as the primary diagnostic test in patients with suspected PE in retrospective outcome studies and in prospective multicenter management studies indicate that the negative predictive value of a negative spiral CT preceded or followed by a negative compression ultrasonography (CUS) is > 99%. Therefore, a helical spiral CT can replace both the VP-scan and pulmonary angiography to safely rule in and out PE. A negative rapid ELISA VIDAS D-dimer test result will reduce the need for helical spiral CT by 25% to 35%."

Blood samples were collected without anticoagulant from 30 pregnant women, matched for chronological and gestational age, 15 healthy pregnant (group A) and 15 women with PE (group B). TNF alpha was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and sTNF alpha-p55 and sTNF alpha-p75 were measured by amplified immunoenzymometric assay. The statistical analysis was carried out using the paired t Student test. The values of TNF alpha were 7.07 +/- 1.63 pg/mL (mean +/- SE) in group A and 16.43 +/- 2.92 in group B pg/mL (p < 0.05).); concentrations of sTNF alpha-p55 were 2.69 +/- 0.17 ng/mL and 5.18 +/- 0.54 ng/mL in groups A and B respectively (p < 0.001); sTNF alpha-p75 reached levels of 5.94 +/- 0.27 ng/mL in healthy pregnant and 9.02 +/- 0.66 ng/mL in patients with PE (p < 0.001). TNF alpha, sTNF alpha-p55 and sTNF alpha-p75 were significantly higher in preeclamptic women than in normotensive controls. These findings indicate that the levels of TNF alpha, el TNF alpha-p55 and TNF alpha-p75 were elevated in PE. Further research is needed to identify modifiable risk factors for the excessive synthesis and release of TNF alpha in pregnancy, and to assess whether the lowering of TNF alpha concentrations in pregnancy alters the incidence and severity of PE."
CD010864,0,8815829,0,[Contribution of laboratory tests and venous investigations in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism].,"The diagnostic strategy of pulmonary embolism is based firstly on pulmonary scintigraphy, a non-invasive investigation which provides a definitive diagnosis in about 30% of patients, and then on pulmonary angiography, which remains the investigation of reference. However, new diagnostic methods have been introduced in order to reduce the number of angiographies. Measurement of plasma D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product, enables exclusion of the diagnosis in 20-50% of patients without pulmonary embolism when the result is normal on ELISA (< 500 micrograms/l with the commercialized Stago test). This is due to the very high sensitivity of D-dimer: in a compilation of recent series with a total of 1,159 patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism, their concentration was over the threshold of 500 micrograms/l in 96% (CI 95%, 93-98) of patients with pulmonary embolism. On the other hand, their low specificity makes them useless for a positive diagnosis of the condition. Lower limb venous compression ultrasonography enables detection of proximal deep venous thrombosis in about 57% (CI 95%, 52-62) of patients with pulmonary embolism, posing the indication for anticoagulation without further investigations because of its high specificity (98%) (CI 95%, 97-99). When venous ultrasonography is normal, however, pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded. A diagnostic strategy associating these two investigations and pulmonary scintigraphy reduces the number of diagnostic angiographies by 30 to 50% according to whether D-dimer and ultrasonography are performed before or after scintigraphy respectively. More extensive use of D-dimer in clinical practice requires more rapid and equally reliable unitary tests as the ELISA."

The aim of the current study was to test the applicability of an easy flow cytometry protocol for ZAP-70 measurement in CLL samples. Samples from 61 CLL patients and 44 normal subjects were analyzed using a commercial ZAP-70 monoclonal antibody (1E7.2 clone) conjugated with phycoerythrin (PE) and Alexa 488 fluorochromes. Modifications of the published methods led to the structure of a simplified in-house method of ZAP-70 measurement. A three-color approach was used with CD19, CD3 gating comparing with the isotype control provided by the same manufacturer. The cutoff levels for ZAP-70 positivity were defined from a receiver operator characteristic curve in relation to the IgV(H) mutational status and from the ln normalized mean value +2 SD of normal controls. Using the 20% cutoff value for ZAP-70 positivity in CLL patients defined by the literature, ZAP-PE had a sensitivity of 55% and a specificity of 98% in predicting the IgV(H) mutational status, whereas the corresponding values for ZAP-Alexa were 55% and 84%, respectively. Using the 7% cutoff value for CD38 positivity, the sensitivity was 55%, whereas the specificity was 76%. ZAP-70-positive patients showed a shorter time to disease progression in comparison with ZAP-70-negative patients (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the 100% specific prediction of mutational status is accompanied by reduced sensitivity, thus limiting ZAP-70's applicability either as a single marker or combined with CD38 for the assessment of the mutational status of CLL."
CD010864,0,20213923,0,Acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy changes the balance of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors in maternal plasma.,"Angiogenic factors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of sepsis. In experimental models of sepsis (endotoxemia and/or cecal ligation puncture), there is increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and the administration of exogenous soluble VEGF receptor (sVEGFR)-1, an antagonist to VEGF, reduces morbidity and mortality. Moreover, a dramatic elevation in sVEGFR-1 has been demonstrated in human sepsis. Although a balance between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors is essential for feto-placental development, the changes of angiogenic factors during pregnancy in the context of infection have never been explored. Angiogenic factors also play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE). This study was conducted to determine if maternal plasma concentrations of placental growth factor (PlGF), sVEGFR-2, and soluble endoglin (sEng) change in pregnancies complicated by acute pyelonephritis (AP) compared with normal pregnancy and PE."

CD010864,0,10331094,0,Laboratory diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism is a common medical condition in both out-patients and in-patients. Despite the development of non-invasive tests, the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism remains a clinical challenge. In an effort to improve diagnostic accuracy and to reduce the necessity of serial testing, laboratory markers of thrombin generation and fibrinolysis have been investigated as first-line screening tests. Although the majority of markers are elevated in acute thrombosis, D-dimer, a specific derivative of cross-linked fibrin, appears to have the most potential clinical utility. Accuracy studies and preliminary management trials suggest that rapid D-dimer enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and the whole blood agglutination assay, SimpliRED D-dimer (Agen Biomedical, Brisbane, Australia), have strong potential as exclusionary tests in patients with suspected venous thrombosis."
CD010864,0,10331093,0,Diagnostic management of venous thromboembolism.,"The accuracy of diagnostic methods for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in symptomatic patients is critically reviewed. In addition, the safety of withholding anticoagulant therapy from patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in whom the qualified diagnostic strategy was normal is evaluated by determining the frequency of venous thromboembolic complications during 3 months of follow-up. It is shown that the currently used available diagnostic techniques for deep vein thrombosis are all able to identify the majority of patients who indeed have venous thrombosis. However, as result of its accuracy and practical advantages, compression ultrasound is the test of choice in the evaluation of symptomatic patients. Patients with a normal test outcome should be re-tested to detect the small proportion of patients with proximally extending calf vein thrombosis. In the strategy of repeated diagnostic testing, impedance plethysmography could be used as an alternative to ultrasonography. To obtain a reduction in repeat tests various diagnostic strategies have been evaluated and it was shown that these strategies, using non-invasive tests, can be as accurate and safe as the invasive reference strategy. The safeties of the various strategies were very similar; however, important differences were observed with respect to the practical implementation of the various diagnostic strategies. Simplification of the repeated testing strategy by using a D-dimer assay and/or a clinical decision rule seems to be promising. The reference standard for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism remains pulmonary angiography. Several strategies based on non-invasive diagnostic methods have been evaluated for their safety and complexability. Perfusion-ventilation lung scanning is the most thoroughly evaluated non-invasive technique so far. It seems safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in patients suspected of pulmonary embolism with a normal perfusion lung scan result; however, further testing is needed in the case of a non-diagnostic perfusion-ventilation lung scan result. At this moment angiography is the method of choice in this category of patients. D-dimer assays, clinical decision rules and ultrasound examinations of the legs seem to have a high potential to limit the need for angiography. Also, spiral computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are promising techniques, but their role in the diagnostic management of pulmonary embolism is still uncertain."

Newly identified clinical characteristics of PE enhance our ability to identify potential patients. Because of laudable efforts to diagnose PE, about 90% of outpatient computed tomographic (CT) angiograms are negative. Overuse of CT angiography has resulted in huge expenses and exposure of many to radiation. Approximately 30% of patients with suspected acute PE would not need imaging if D-dimer is normal and clinical assessment is not a high probability, but such triage is uncommonly used. Perhaps perfusion imaging should be used more frequently. Radiation and cost with scintigraphy are less than with CT angiography. Single-photon emission computed tomography lung scans appear to be more effective than planar lung scans. Diseases associated with an increased risk of PE are being identified, but recommended prophylaxis usually is not given. Potential benefits and risks of treatment options need to be assessed."

The sequential modifications of titers during plasma-exchange (PE) and at follow-up were investigated in 15 patients. In pretreatment sera, we found significantly increased antibody titers to GM1 (37% of the patients), central myelin proteins (28%), and cardiolipin (21%). Seventeen patients out of 29 (58%) presented increased IgG or IgM antibody to at least one of the antigens considered as compared to 10 out of 70 controls (14%, P = 0.00001). By Western blot, IgG or IgM antibodies reactive with the triton insoluble fraction of central myelin were observed in 19 out of 28 GBS patients (67%). The follow-up measurements during and after PE showed a declining autoantibody titer in 10 out of 15 patients. However, in the remaining 5 GBS patients, we observed a persistently elevated titer or an increase from baseline values occurring during or after PE and reaching a peak. In 2 of the 5 patients, the titer peak preceded a clinical re-exacerbation. The presence of a persistently elevated or an increasing autoantibody titer during treatment with PE merits further investigation and may help to clarify the pathogenesis of GBS and improve its treatment."
CD010864,0,1387724,0,[Measurements of plasmin-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex and FDP.D dimer levels in the fibrinolytic therapy of acute pulmonary thromboembolism].,"The key enzyme for fibrinolysis is plasmin, which is converted from plasminogen by plasminogen activator. Activated plasmin lyses fibrinogen and fibrin to make fibrin degradation products(FDPs) and plasmin is inactivated immediately by alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor. As FDP.D dimer is derived solely from insoluble fibrin, FDP.D dimer is thought of as an index for clot lysis. We measured plasmin-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex(PIC) and FDP.D dimer plasma levels in 3 patients with acute pulmonary thromboembolism treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator(tPA). Fifteen million units of tPA(TD-2061) were infused in one hour on the first, second and third hospital days. PIC and FDP.D dimer before tPA infusion showed slightly elevated values as compared to normal ranges. They increased markedly after tPA infusion. These findings suggest that the fibrinolytic system is slightly activated in the acute phase of pulmonary thromboembolism and also strongly activated by tPA infusion. Increased FDP D dimer suggests that fibrin clots are dissolved by activated plasmin. Improvement of arterial oxygen tension was observed after tPA infusion. As sustained higher FDP.D dimer means the existence of fibrin clots, heparin treatment should be continued for prevention of clot formation as long as FDP.D dimer shows higher value. In conclusion, PIC and FDP.D dimer are useful indices not only to detect the activated state of the fibrinolytic system but also to know clot lysis in tPA treatment."

Basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) is a potent angiogenic factor which promotes in vitro growth of endothelial cells and in vivo vessel formation. We investigated the expression of b-FGF in patients affected with malignant and non-malignant pleural diseases and presenting clinically with non-specific signs and symptoms. We also studied the relationships between the expression of b-FGF in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MM) and tumour aggressiveness, assessed as tumour vessel density (TVD), or patient survival. Basic-FGF was measured by immunoassay in the serum and pleural effusions (PE) of 37 patients. Of these, MM was diagnosed in 15/37 patients while the remaining patients had either peripheral lung adenocarcinoma (PLA) or benign inflammatory pleural disease (BPD). The mean b-FGF level measured 8.5+/-6.1 pg/ml in the PE of the malignant group (MM + PLA) and 23.9+/-19.8 in the PE of the non-malignant group (BPD) (p=0.001). The mean b-FGF level was significantly lower in the PE of MM patients (6.9+/-5.2 pg/ml) compared to BPD patients (p=0.004). Linear regression analysis showed a significant inverse correlation (r=-0.59; p=0.041) between b-FGF levels found in MM PE and patient survival. A noteworthy relationship between high serum b-FGF levels and reduced survival was also observed (r=-0.57; p=0.052). Interestingly, both serum (r=0.48; p=0.114) and PE (r=0.26; p=0.413) b-FGF levels in MM patients correlated poorly with TVD. Our data indicate that b-FGF is significantly more expressed in non-malignant compared to malignant PE, this difference being particularly evident between MM and BPD. Our results also suggest that high b-FGF levels correlate with poor MM patient survival through mechanisms which may be independent of b-FGF angiogenic potential."

CD010864,0,18068195,0,Enhanced sterol response element-binding protein in postintervention restenotic blood vessels plays an important role in vascular smooth muscle proliferation.,"Postintervention restenosis (PIRS) after balloon angioplasty or stent implantation is a limitation for these interventional procedures even with the advent of new drug-eluting stents. Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) are transcription factors governing cellular lipid biosynthesis and thus critical in the regulation of the lipid-rich cell membranes. PIRS following injury results partially from newly proliferating cells expressing vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) markers. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor stimulation are well recognized diverse mitogens for VSMC activation in PIRS. We examined whether PDGF, LPA and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor stimulation with phenylephrine (PE) regulate SREBP expression and subsequently, VSMC proliferation. Our results show that PDGF, LPA and PE upregulate SREBP-1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. PDGF, LPA and PE-mediated proliferation is dependent on SREBP since inhibition of SREBP expression using targeted knockdown of the SREBP precursor SREBP activating protein (SCAP) by siRNA led to an attenuation of SREBP expression and decreased PDGF, LPA and PE induced proliferation. In two different in vivo PIRS models we found that SREBP-1 was enhanced in the injured blood vessel wall, especially within the neointima and co-localized with alpha-smooth muscle actin positive cells. Thus, SREBP is enhanced in the vessel wall following PIRS and is important in the regulation of pro-hyperplasia molecular signaling. SREBP inhibition may be a powerful tool to limit PIRS."

Safe bedside methods to exclude PE could save scarce health care resources if they exclude large proportions of patients with suspected PE and are widely applicable. Non-Elisa D-dimer in combination with pre-test probability of suspected PE can safely exclude PE at the bedside. Pre-test probability can be assigned by gestalt or by using clinical models (Wells, Wicki, Rodger)."

Testing for pulmonary embolism (PE) has become easier and widespread due to D-dimer blood tests. Safe use of these tests is only possible if sensitivity is high and they are used in non-high probability patients. We evaluated diagnostic performance of the HemosIL HS D-dimer, which despite FDA approval in 2005, has been minimally reported in prospective standard clinical care."

Modification of the micelles with tumor specific antibodies further enhanced the efficiency of tumor accumulation.
CD010864,0,15999935,0,[Acute chest pain--it's not always the heart! What additional laboratory and diagnostic imaging is needed].,"Few diagnostic decisions in medicine have been more heavily researched and debated than the approach to patients with acute chest pain. In addition, the question is which patients with acute chest pain have a presentation benign enough to make discharge from the emergency department safe and appropriate despite the advances in diagnostic tests. There is always the possibility of missed diagnosis which may cause substantial morbidity and mortality. The use of algorithms or protocols is not always sufficient to avoid missed diagnosis and the individual physicians's diagnostic performance and clinical experience is as important as the best algorithm for atypical chest pain! Patients with atypical symptoms are most likely to be mistakenly discharged. This article does mainly focus on diagnostic tests including ECG and biomarkers such as troponin and D-dimer as well as the investigation by helical CT scan in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. The article also discuss the importance of repeated assessments of biomarkers and the determination of the exact time interval between the first clinical symptoms and the presentation to the emergency department. This time interval can be very crucial for the diagnostic work-up of patients with acute chest pain."
CD010864,0,2273313,0,A sensitive assay for anti-phosphatidylethanol-amine antibody in patients with recurrent fetal loss.,"There is strong evidence that anti-phospholipid antibodies is implicated in thrombosis and recurrent fetal death. In recent years, it has been suggested that anti-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) antibody is an important antibody of this type. In the present study, we established a sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect anti-PE antibodies and examined the relationship between the anti-PE antibody level in serum and recurrent abortion. The improvement of the assay was made by treating PE with 1.0% acetic acid in methanol solution prior to its application to the microplates. This treatment markedly increased the antigenicity of PE. Using this modified ELISA, anti-PE antibodies in 10 patients with a history of recurrent fetal loss were measured before and after therapy during the last period of their pregnancies. IgG anti-PE antibodies were detected in all 10 patients. Four patients exhibiting high titers of IgG anti-PE antibody experienced subsequent intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), while the other 6 patients, whose titers of IgG anti-PE antibody had decreased with therapy, had live births. These results suggest that this modified ELISA for estimating IgG anti-PE antibody is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with recurrent fetal loss."
CD010864,0,12574808,0,Prospective assessment of the natural history of positive D-dimer results in persons with acute venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE).,"The natural history of initially positive D-dimers for venous thromboembolism is not known. If it returns to negative in the majority of patients, it would be potentially helpful to diagnose a recurrence. In this study, we prospectively measured D-dimer levels in outpatients with a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. There were a total of 152 patients with an average age of 57. D-dimer results were performed at baseline and repeated at one week, one month and three months. At baseline 120 of 152 (79%) had a positive D-dimer result. Of those with an initially positive result, 80% were still positive at one week and 39% were still positive at one month. Finally at three months, 13% remained positive. Seven patients had recurrent events and all had persistently elevated D-dimers at one month. This study suggests that a persistently positive D-dimer result after one month of treatment may indicate a higher risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism. D-dimer testing for the diagnosis of recurrence of venous thromboembolism deserves further study."
CD010864,0,12032865,0,Cooperative role of E-cadherin and sialyl-Lewis X/A-deficient MUC1 in the passive dissemination of tumor emboli in inflammatory breast carcinoma.,"Inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC) is characterized by florid tumor emboli within lymphovascular spaces termed lymphovascular invasion (LVI). Using a human-scid model of IBC (MARY-X), we have demonstrated using retrovirally-mediated dominant-negative E-cadherin mutant approaches (H-2K(d)-E-cad), that the tumor cell embolus (IBC spheroid) forms on the basis of an intact and overexpressed E-cadherin/alpha, beta-catenin axis which mediates tumor cell-tumor cell adhesion analogous to the embryonic blastocyst and accounts for the compactness of the embolus. The tumor cell embolus (IBC spheroid), in contrast, fails to bind the surrounding vascular endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo because of markedly decreased sialyl-Lewis X/A carbohydrate ligand-binding epitopes on its overexpressed MUC1 which are necessary for binding endothelial cell E-selectin. This tumor cell-endothelial cell aversion further contributes to the compactness of the IBC spheroid and its passivity in metastasis dissemination. This passivity is manifested by a dramatic increase in metastatic pulmonary emboli following palpation of the primary tumor. In assessing this passivity of metastatic dissemination, we compared the effects of palpation on MARY-X with the effects of palpation on a derived dominant-negative E-cadherin mutant (H-2K(d)-E-cad), as well as other well known human tumoral xenografts exhibiting no (MCF-7, T47D), low (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468) or high (C8161, M24(met)) levels of spontaneous metastasis but no LVI. Palpation of each xenograft similarly increased intratumoral pressure by 200% (10-->30 mmHg) but dramatically increased the numbers and sizes of pulmonary metastases 10-100-fold (P<0.001) only in MARY-X. The mechanism of this effect was through an immediate post-palpation release of circulating tumor emboli detected 2-3 min after palpation (P<0.01) by human cytokeratin 19 RT-PCR of extracted RNA from 300 microl of murine blood. Although circulating human tumor cell-derived growth factors (IGF-I, IGF-II, TGF-alpha and TGF-beta) and angiogenic factors (VEGF and bFGF) were detected by ELISA in murine serum of MARY-X, palpation did not further increase the circulating levels of these factors (P>0.1). Our findings support the cooperative role of E-cadherin and sialyl-Lewis X/A-deficient MUC1 in the passive dissemination of tumor emboli in IBC."

CD010864,0,22473062,0,A preliminary study of platelet activation after embolization of marrow contents.,Intravasation of bone marrow contents into venous circulation and pulmonary embolization after intramedullary nailing may be coupled with the activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades. The objective of this study was to assess hemostatic response to pulmonary extravasated marrow contents. We hypothesize that activation of platelet activity and the coagulation cascade may occur after embolization of marrow contents in an experimental animal model of intramedullary nailing.
CD010864,0,10595787,0,Detection of soluble alpha1 integrin in human serum.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection and quantitation of soluble alpha1beta1 integrins (salpha1) in human serum samples was developed. Solid phase-bound anti-alpha1 integrin monoclonal antibody (mAb) TS2/7 was used to capture salpha1, and mAb 1B3.1 was used to detect the immobilized integrin. An extract of human placenta (PE) containing 340 ng/mL of VLA-1 molecules served as a positive control, and serum samples from normal donors and patients were assayed. Optimal binding of anti-alpha1 integrin mAb 1B3.1, expressed as specific optical density (OD), was obtained when a 5 microng/mL solution of anti-alpha1 integrin ""capture"" mAb TS2/7 was immobilized to the wells and the PE was added. Solutions of albumin or collagen, in contrast, did not result in binding, confirming the specificity of the assay for sal. Furthermore, the specific OD of the wells correlated directly with the concentration of PE. A concentration of salpha1 above that of a 1:100 dilution of PE--that is, >3.4 ng/mL of integrin, in which the intra-assay correlation of variance was <5.7%, was found in 5 of 8, 3 of 8, and 6 of 9 serum samples from normal individuals, patients with connective tissue diseases (CTD), and patients with liver diseases (LD), respectively. These results suggest, for the first time, that salpha1 are present in healthy and diseased human serum."
CD010864,0,16996057,0,Retinal and ciliary body pigment epithelium suppress activation of T lymphocytes via transforming growth factor beta.,"The ocular microenvironment is immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory. Pigment epithelial (PE) cells isolated from the eye possess a new property of suppressing T cell receptor-dependent activation of T cells in vitro. This property depends on their capacity to produce cell-surface and soluble inhibitory molecules. The iris pigment epithelia (IPE) do so through direct cell-to-cell contact with naÃ¯ve T cells, and this suppressive contact is mediated by interactions between B7 and membrane-bound TGFbeta that are expressed constitutively on IPE. We have now examined whether other ocular PE cells, e.g., retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) and ciliary body pigment epithelia (CBPE), have a similar suppressive property by a similar process. We have found that RPE and CBPE significantly suppress the activation of bystander T cells via soluble inhibitory factors. RPE and CBPE secrete different soluble inhibitory factors including TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2. Although IPE cells suppress the activation of bystander T cells by membrane-bound TGFbeta, the RPE and CBPE do so by soluble forms of active TGFbeta through mechanisms independent of cell contact. These ocular PE cells are capable modifying T cell function by enhancing production of regulatory cytokines including TGFbeta. We propose that this mechanism of suppression via TGFbeta ensures that soluble active TGFbeta is released into the ocular microenvironment in order to create the immune privilege of the posterior segment of the eye."
CD010864,0,15224764,0,Extensive evaluation of the instrumentation laboratory IL test D-Dimer immunoturbidimetric assay on the ACL 9000 determines the D-Dimer cutoff value for reliable exclusion of venous thromboembolism.,"The clinical diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is often difficult and requires a number of imaging tests plus clinical assessment. It is now accepted that pretest clinical probability of disease plus a sensitive, quantitative D-Dimer assay can be used to reliably exclude VTE. In design of diagnostic strategies for VTE it is recommended that the D-Dimer assay be evaluated for sensitivity and specificity in well-designed, blinded studies using a cohort of patients for whom the assay will ultimately be used. Therefore we evaluated the IL Test D-Dimer on the ACL 9000 automated coagulation analyzer for its sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of VTE. A total of 512 patients admitted to the emergency department of Providence Hospital with suspected VTE were included in the dataset. Our aim was to find the clinically meaningful IL Test D-Dimer cutoff value, which would give us 100% sensitivity and the highest possible specificity for exclusion of VTE. Patients were categorized clinically into low, medium, or high pretest probability and had computed tomographic and/or ventilation-perfusion scans for investigation of PE and ultrasound studies for suspected DVT, with the laboratory blinded to the clinical findings. Of the 511 patients, 28 (5.4%) had confirmed VTE (PE and/or DVT) based on imaging and clinical studies. Applying receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, we determined from our study that a cutoff value of 237 ng/mL IL Test D-Dimer gave a 100% sensitivity with a specificity of 38% for detection of VTE. The findings demonstrate that a diagnostic strategy using the IL Test D-Dimer assay as a first-line test in combination with pretest probability is safe and can be used in patients with suspected VTE. In conclusion, patient analysis results indicating low or moderate pretest probability for VTE and a negative IL Test D-Dimer (cutoff value of 237 ng/mL) assay result on the ACL 9000 reliably exclude VTE (both PE and DVT). We expect that inclusion of the rapid IL Test D-Dimer assay for assessment of suspected VTE in the emergency department at Providence will result in improved patient diagnosis and therapy, reduction in unnecessary radiological investigations, and lowering of overall costs associated with investigation of patients suspected of having VTE disease."
CD010864,0,21112198,0,The protective effect of peony extract on acute myocardial infarction in rats.,"To investigate the protective effects, and the mechanisms involved, of an extract of the medicinal herb radix paeoniae rubra (PE) on cardiovascular disease, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery in Sprague Dawley rats. Animals were randomly divided into six groups: control, sham-operated, AMI, AMI+PE low dose, AMI+PE high dose, and AMI+positive control. Myocardial enzymes, cytokines, oxidative stress, blood coagulation times, a marker for early stage apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, and expression levels of bax, bcl-2 and fas in isolated primary cardiomyocytes were examined. In contrast with control and sham groups, significant increases in the following parameters were measured in the blood of AMI group animals: activities of cardiac enzymes including glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, Î±-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase, and levels of IL-10, TNFÎ±, and lipid peroxidation. Under the same conditions, superoxide dismutase activity, thrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time decreased significantly. PE showed a dose-dependent protection against AMI-induced alterations in cardiac enzymes, cytokines, oxidative stress, and coagulation. In AMI cardiomyocytes, compared with control and sham groups, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, early stage apoptosis, caspase-3 activity and expression levels of bax, bcl-2 and fas significantly increased, while the ratio bcl-2/bax decreased. PE showed dose-dependent protection. These results suggest that PE is an effective agent for protecting against AMI; possible mechanisms may include the regulation of cardiac enzymes, cytokines, oxidative stress, coagulation and apoptosis."

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 12 patients with PE, 23 patients with simple EH and complex EH with atypia, and 31 patients with EC were included. A semiquantitative scoring system was used to assess the intensity and degree of staining of VEGF. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed with endoglin and anti-CD 34 in most vascular areas. VEGF expression was significantly higher in EC and EH than PE, but there was no difference between EC and EH. According to CD 34 staining, there were no differences in MVD between groups. However, mean MVD counts assessed by endoglin were significantly higher in EC than PE and EH. Although VEGF expression in EC was significantly higher, it did not correlate with other measures of angiogenesis. MVD using endoglin seemed to reflect neoplastic angiogenesis better than CD 34."

CD010864,0,18064322,0,Hypercoagulability after partial liver resection.,"One concern of living donor liver transplantation remains the risk of morbidity and/or mortality for the donors, including the risk of postoperative thrombosis. We studied the coagulation changes after partial liver resection in l2 living donors and eight patients with non-malignant hepatic tumors (controls) and searched for potential predictive markers of thrombotic complications. Thrombosis (pulmonary embolism and portal vein thrombosis) developed in two donors and two controls. In donors and controls, we observed an early postoperative decrease in coagulation inhibitors protein C and antithrombin together with an increase in factor VIII and von Willebrand factor, which both persisted when prothrombin time had returned to normal. Dysregulation in the haemostatic system was confirmed by increased prothrombotic markers, with a 10- to 30-fold increase in thrombin-antithrombin complexes and moderate increase(1.5- to 2.0-fold) in sP-Selectin. No difference between donors and controls was observed and the data were pooled for comparison of patients with (n = 4) versus without (n = 16) thrombosis. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes were significantly higher in the thrombosis group, on day 1 (28.8 vs. 13.5 microg/l, p = 0.027) and day 2 (52.3 vs. 9.3 microg/l, p = 0.013). sP-selectin was also significantly higher in the thrombosis group on day 2 (103 vs. 53 ng/ml, p = 0.044) and day 4 (116 vs. 58 ng/ml, p = 0.026) after surgery. Our study indicates that improvement of thromboprophylaxis in partial liver resection is needed. It also suggests that thrombin-antithrombin complexes and sP-selectin could serve as early biological predictors of thrombotic complications in the post-operative period."

Pulmonary arterial lesions consisted of atherosclerosis of the elastic pulmonary arteries, and medial hypertrophy and concentric laminar fibrosis of the muscular pulmonary arteries in seven patients, plexiform lesions in six patients and necrotizing vasculitis in one patient. Pulmonary emboli were not identified. Five patients had manifestations of autoimmune disease, including laboratory abnormalities (positive antinuclear antibody, positive latex agglutination for rheumatoid factor, hypergammaglobulinemia or antimitochondrial antibody) in four, necrotizing vasculitis in one, Raynaud's phenomenon in two and clinical evidence of multisystem collagen vascular disease in two. Five patients had liver disease which developed prior to or concomitant with the onset of pulmonary hypertension. At autopsy, one patient had prominent periportal fibrosis and four had macronodular (postnecrotic) cirrhosis (active in three and inactive in one). Four of these five patients with liver disease and pulmonary hypertension had evidence of autoimmune phenomena.

This study analyses the qualitative nature and kinetics of serum immunoglobulins as well as complement resynthesis after PE in sham-operated (PE) and splenectomized (PE+Sx) syngeneic LOU/C rats; non-PE sham-operated or splenectomized animals were used as controls. PE was performed in unanesthetized, unheparinized rats. Immunoglobulin isotypes and subclasses (IgM, IgG1, IgG2 alpha, IgG2b) of total circulating Ab were measured pre-PE and up to 21 days post-PE, using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and specific mouse antirat monoclonal Ab. Antiguinea-pig (GP) XG Ab (IgM, IgG2a) serum levels were measured using cellular ELISA with cultured GP endothelial cells as targets. Sx alone significantly reduced XG IgM serum levels (p < 0.0001). Maximal rebound of total and XG IgM was observed on day 3 post-PE, reaching 674% and 187% of the pre-PE levels, respectively; these overshoots were entirely suppressed by Sx (p < 0.005 for total IgM; p < 0.0001 for XG IgM). Total IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG1 as well as XG IgG2a serum levels did not show significant overshoot post-PE. The activity of the complement classical pathway (mean +/- SD), assessed by CH50, was decreased at 51 +/- 19% of basal value 15 minutes after PE, and had returned to baseline level by day 2 post-PE with or without Sx."

CD010864,0,3400569,0,Utility of cross-linked fibrin degradation products in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Blood samples from patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) were obtained at the time of diagnostic lung scanning to determine whether identification of those with activation of endogenous fibrinolytic pathways could serve as a screening test for PE. Cross-linked fibrin degradation products (XDPs) were measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay with a specific monoclonal antibody (MabCO Dimertest EIA) that recognizes cross-linked D-dimer fragments and related high molecular weight fibrin derivatives containing D-dimer but that does not cross-react with fibrinogen or its plasmin degradation products. PE was present in 19 with positive pulmonary angiograms and absent in 50 with completely normal lung scans. Elevated levels of XDPs (greater than 144 ng/ml) were present in 17 of 19 patients (89%) with PE and in 28 of 50 (56%) without PE (p = 0.30). Among those with PE present, the XDP levels were (means +/- sd) 864 +/- 1,068 ng/ml (median = 470 ng/ml) compared with 285 +/- 395 ng/ml (median = 155 ng/ml) among those with PE absent (p = 0.003). For PE detection, elevated XDP levels provided a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 44%, a positive predictive value of 38%, a negative predictive value of 92%, and an accuracy of 57%. Among those with elevated XDP levels and PE absent, 75% had no apparent reason for XDP elevations. These data indicate that XDPs are significantly elevated in patients with PE but that, in contrast to earlier reports, measurement of XDPs among individuals with suspected PE may not be sufficiently accurate to be clinically useful in screening."

CD010864,0,16264092,0,Localization of phosphatidylserine in boar sperm cell membranes during capacitation and acrosome reaction.,"One of the essential properties of mammalian, including sperm, plasma membranes is a stable transversal lipid asymmetry with the aminophospholipids, phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), typically in the inner, cytoplasmic leaflet. The maintenance of this nonrandom lipid distribution is important for the homeostasis of the cell. To clarify the relevance of lipid asymmetry to sperm function, we have studied the localization of PS in boar sperm cell membranes. By using labeled annexin V as a marker for PS and propidium iodide (PI) as a stain for nonviable cells in conjunction with different methods (flow cytometry, fluorescence and electron microscopy), we have assessed the surface exposure of PS in viable cells during sperm genesis, that is, before and during capacitation as well as after acrosome reaction. An approach was set up to address also the presence of PS in the outer acrosome membrane. The results show that PS is localized in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane as well as on the outer acrosome membrane. Our results further indicate the cytoplasmic localization of PS in the postacrosomal region. During capacitation and acrosome reaction of spermatozoa, PS does not become exposed on the outer surface of the viable cells. Only in a subpopulation of PI-positive sperm cells does PS became accessible upon capacitation. The stable cytoplasmic localization of PS in the plasma membrane, as well as in the outer acrosome membrane, is assumed to be essential for a proper genesis of sperm cells during capacitation and acrosome reaction."
CD010864,0,19376394,0,Quantification and immunophenotypic characterization of bone marrow and umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells by multicolor flow cytometry.,"In recent years, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been attracting the greatest interest in the regeneration of injured tissues, autoimmune diseases, and transplantation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Bone marrow (BM) represents the major source of MSC; however, umbilical cord blood (UCB) MSC has some advantages over BM, such as the higher differentiation capability and noninvasive collection methods. We sought to establish a 7-color, single-tube flow cytometric assay to quantify MSC in fresh tissues, namely BM and UCB, based on phenotypic markers of these cells. Moreover, we evaluated the differential expression of these markers in BM and UCB MSC. We used 5 UCB samples and 5 BM samples obtained from individuals without hematologic disease. To characterize MSC we used the following combination of monoclonal antibodies: CD71-FITC; CD105-PE; CD184-PE-Cy5; CD34-PE-Cy7; CD133-APC; CD45-APC-H7; CD44-Pacific blue, acquiring at least 1 million nucleated cells. We observed a greater number of BM MSC when compared with UCB MSC as well as some differences in the expression of some MSC antigens, particularly CD105 and CD44. Based on our preliminary results, phenotypic identification of MSC by flow cytometry is possible using a 7-color, single-tube assay. However, culture assays after sorting of cells characterized in this study are required to prove that they correspond to MSC."

CD010864,0,12548278,0,Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"This clinical policy focuses on critical issues in the evaluation and management of patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE). A MEDLINE search for clinical trials published from January 1995 through April 2001 was performed using the key words ""pulmonary embolus"" with limits of ""clinical investigations"" and ""clinical policies."" Subcommittee members and expert peer reviewers also supplied articles with direct bearing on the policy. This policy focuses on 2 major areas of current interest and/or controversy: (1) diagnostic: utility of D -dimer, ventilation-perfusion scanning, and spiral computed tomography angiogram in the evaluation of PE; and (2) therapeutic: indications for fibrinolytic therapy. Recommendations for patient management are provided for each 1 of these topics based on strength of evidence (Level A, B, or C). Level A recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty; Level B recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect moderate clinical certainty; and Level C recommendations represent other patient management strategies based on preliminary, inconclusive, or conflicting evidence, or based on panel consensus. This guideline is intended for physicians working in emergency departments or chest pain evaluation units."

A rapid assay for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been advocated for the diagnosis of heart failure, using a single cutoff of 100 pg/mL. BNP is produced by both the right and left cardiac ventricles and is elevated in a variety of conditions, including heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, pulmonary embolism, left ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure, circulatory overload, acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, and sepsis. This multitude of causes of BNP elevation imposes limits on its diagnostic use for heart failure. The literature on the use of BNP testing for diagnosis of heart failure is reviewed, and improved guidelines for its interpretation are suggested."

CD010864,0,16038715,0,Elevated levels of leukocyte tissue factor mRNA in patients with venous thromboembolism.,"Tissue factor (TF) mRNA levels in leukocyte and TF antigen in plasma were examined in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Although TF mRNA levels in leukocytes were higher in patients with DVT than in healthy volunteers, they were lower in patients with DVT than in those with solid cancer and those with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). On the other hand, the plasma levels of TF antigens were markedly high in patients with DVT/pulmonary embolism (PE). Analysis of the role of underlying disease of DVT showed no significant difference in TF mRNA levels and TF antigens among patients with solid cancer, post-surgical, other diseases and those free of underlying diseases. In patients with VTE, plasma levels of D-dimer, soluble fibrin, GE-XDP and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 did not correlate with TF mRNA or TF antigen. In analysis of 18 patients with PE with and without DVT, TF mRNA levels in leukocytes correlated with the plasma levels of D-dimer. These findings suggest that TF in leukocytes is more likely to be involved in the development of thrombosis in PE than DVT."
CD010864,0,14601697,0,Rational use of D-dimer measurement to exclude acute venous thromboembolic disease.,"Clinical diagnosis of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease is often inaccurate because signs and symptoms are nonspecific. Testing for the absence of D-dimer levels in the blood of patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can assist in ruling out these illnesses. Some highly sensitive D-dimer assays have sufficient specificity to assist in the exclusion of VTE disease. Numerous clinical management trials using D-dimer measurement in association with additional diagnostic tests have shown that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in selected patients with suspected VTE disease who have negative D-dimer assay results. Applying these diagnostic strategies can potentially decrease the need for radiological testing. The simplicity of measuring D-dimer levels creates the potential for misuse. For safe patient management, clinicians must understand the indications for and limitations of D-dimer measurement in the diagnosis of VTE disease."

CD010864,0,15870247,0,Use of the D-dimer assay for diagnosing thromboembolic disease in the dog.,"Although the exact incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in small animals is unknown, it is thought that PTE is a substantial, under-diagnosed complication. The difficulty in diagnosing PTE in small animals is confounded by its subtle symptomatic presentation and a lack of clinical suspicion, coexisting disease states, and lack of noninvasive tests that are sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PTE. Although numerous laboratory markers of coagulation have been studied, only the D-dimer assay has shown clinical utility in detecting early embolism in humans. This paper examines the use of D-dimer assays and other clinical modalities in the diagnostic approach to thromboembolic disease in small animals."
CD010864,0,20174752,0,Application of a decision rule and a D-dimer assay in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Current strategies for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) include a clinical decision rule (CDR), followed by a D-dimer assay in patients with an unlikely clinical probability. We assessed the implementation of the current guidelines for the diagnosis of PE. A first questionnaire was sent to internists and pulmonologists to assess the proportion of physicians that adequately applied the guidelines. Two versions of a second questionnaire were sent presenting five hypothetical cases of which in two cases with an intermediate clinical probability an abnormal D-dimer test result was added to one version. We assessed the variation of the CDR and compared the proportions of a likely clinical probability between the two versions. A total of 65 physicians responded to the first questionnaire (response rate 75%). Half of the physicians (N=29; 46%) indicated that they use a CDR in all patients and 22 physicians (45%) indicated that they review the D-dimer result after they examined patients. Sixty-two physicians responded on the second questionnaire (response rate 36%). A shift was observed from an unlikely to a likely probability when an abnormal D-dimer test result was added to the clinical information (22% to 41%; p=0.22 and 26% to 50%; p<0.05). Our findings indicate that physicians do not use the guidelines for diagnosis of PE consistently. Furthermore, the knowledge of an abnormal D-dimer test result before seeing the patient leads to a higher CDR score. Physicians should therefore first examine patients before taking note of the D-dimer test result."
CD010864,0,12628308,0,An ELISA method for detection of human antibodies to an immunotoxin.,"The use of biological molecules, such as immunotoxins, as pharmaceuticals is limited by the presence and development of human antibodies to these agents. This immune response can cause significant inflammatory-related toxicities and can interfere with the efficacy of the biological agent. Therefore, a clinically applicable method to detect these human antibodies is needed for screening patients prior to enrollment and for monitoring patients during treatment. The SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin currently in clinical trials is a hybrid molecule targeted against mesothelin-expressing cancer cells via the Fv portion of a murine antibody linked to the Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), which can inhibit protein synthesis leading to cell death. The objective of this study was to determine if an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based method could be used to detect human anti-SS1(dsFv)-PE38 antibodies in patient serum."
CD010864,0,8887002,0,Alteration of the aPA ELISA by UV exposure of polystyrene microtiter plates.,"Interlaboratory inconsistencies in antiphospholipid antibody (aPA) solid phase assays have prompted controversy in clinical laboratory testing for aPA. We found that the aPA ELISA can be influenced by the type of microtiter plate utilized and by the conditions in which the plates are stored. By exposing 96-well, flat-bottom polystyrene microtiter plates to short wave UV light (254 nm), the aPA ELISA signal decreased in a UV dose-dependent manner. No effect was seen with long wave UV light (366 nm). These results were independent of the antibody isotype under study or the phospholipid (PL) antigen used: anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) and cardiolipin (CL), or zwitterionic phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Purified human beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta 2 GPI), a known cofactor for anionic PL, and rabbit anti-beta 2 GPI antisera were used to demonstrate that beta 2 GPI bound equally to UV treated and untreated microtiter plates. In contrast, recognition of beta 2 GPI on an anionic PL surface was decreased on UV treated plates, suggesting that UV exposure alters the lipid binding properties of the microliter plate. To determine whether UV exposure inhibited PL binding directly or caused a change in the way the PL was bound, the amount of PL bound to UV treated and untreated plates was measured by using fluorescent labeled PS and a fluorimeter. PS binding was decreased by 53% in UV treated wells as compared to untreated wells. These data show that short wave UV exposure reduces PL binding to polystyrene microtiter plates, thereby reducing the amount of beta 2 GPI bound to PL coated ELISA plates. Thus by using UV exposed microtiter plates, decreased or false-negative a PA ELISA results may be obtained for aPA positive plasmas."

CD010864,0,16848401,0,"""SMART"" drug delivery systems: double-targeted pH-responsive pharmaceutical nanocarriers.","To develop targeted pharmaceutical carriers additionally capable of responding to certain local stimuli, such as decreased pH values in tumors or infarcts, targeted long-circulating PEGylated liposomes and PEG-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE)-based micelles have been prepared with several functions. First, they are capable of targeting a specific cell or organ by attaching the monoclonal antimyosin antibody 2G4 to their surface via pNP-PEG-PE moieties. Second, these liposomes and micelles were additionally modified with biotin or TAT peptide (TATp) moieties attached to the surface of the nanocarrier by using biotin-PE or TATp-PE or TATp-short PEG-PE derivatives. PEG-PE used for liposome surface modification or for micelle preparation was made degradable by inserting the pH-sensitive hydrazone bond between PEG and PE (PEG-Hz-PE). Under normal pH values, biotin and TATp functions on the surface of nanocarriers were ""shielded"" by long protecting PEG chains (pH-degradable PEG(2000)-PE or PEG(5000)-PE) or by even longer pNP-PEG-PE moieties used to attach antibodies to the nanocarrier (non-pH-degradable PEG(3400)-PE or PEG(5000)-PE). At pH 7.4-8.0, both liposomes and micelles demonstrated high specific binding with 2G4 antibody substrate, myosin, but very limited binding on an avidin column (biotin-containing nanocarriers) or internalization by NIH/3T3 or U-87 cells (TATp-containing nanocarriers). However, upon brief incubation (15-30 min) at lower pH values (pH 5.0-6.0), nanocarriers lost their protective PEG shell because of acidic hydrolysis of PEG-Hz-PE and acquired the ability to become strongly retained on an avidin column (biotin-containing nanocarriers) or effectively internalized by cells via TATp moieties (TATp-containing nanocarriers). We consider this result as the first step in the development of multifunctional stimuli-sensitive pharmaceutical nanocarriers."

Multivariate analysis and logistic regression were applied to differentiate between the 2 groups of patients, and used to develop a diagnostic model based on the concentrations of the constituents identified as being influential. Significantly higher concentrations of alanine (P < .001), glycine (P = .025), and ergothioneine (P = .049) were found in erythrocytes from preeclamptic patients.

CD010864,0,23196319,0,Risk of recurrence in patients with pulmonary embolism: predictive role of D-dimer and of residual perfusion defects on lung scintigraphy.,"The stratification of recurrence risk after a first episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important topic of research, especially in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). Elevated D-dimer levels and residual vein obstruction (RVO) at compression ultrasonography have been studied as predictors of recurrence after withdrawing oral anticoagulant treatment (OAT). It is still unknown if residual perfusion defects (PD) on lung scintigraphy are related to recurrent PE. In the present study, we evaluated the association of PD with PE recurrence. The relationship between PD, elevated D-dimer levels, and RVO was also investigated. We prospectively followed 236 consecutive patients who survived a first episode of objectively confirmed PE, with or without deep-vein thrombosis. After at least three months of OAT, treatment was withdrawn in 139 patients. D-dimer levels were evaluated at one month of OAT withdrawal, RVO was measured, and perfusion lung scan (P-scan) was performed to evaluate PD. During follow-up, 20 patients experienced a recurrent episode of VTE. Elevated D-dimer levels were significantly associated with VTE recurrence, (p=0.003). RVO was present in 22% of the patients with recurrence and in 7.5% of those without (p=0.07). No significant association was found between PD >10% and VTE recurrence, D-dimer, or RVO. In conclusion, we confirmed the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels for recurrent VTE. Residual PD on lung scintigraphy are neither predictive of recurrence nor related to D-dimer levels or RVO."

Plasma levels of these molecules were measured in 243 patients suspected of having DVT and 100 healthy volunteers (controls). Out of 243 patients, 20 patients were diagnosed with DVT. In the control group, plasma levels of D-dimer and SF did not show normal distribution, and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of D-dimer and SF were 2.45 microg/mL and 6.92 microg/mL, respectively. Plasma levels of D-dimer and SF of patients with DVT were significantly higher than of those without DVT. In patients with DVT, the minimum values of D-dimer and SF were 1.71 and 1.44 microg/mL, respectively. When the cutoff value was set at the average+1 SD of those of the control (D-dimer, about 1.8 microg/mL; SF, about 1.4 microg/mL), 1 and 0 patient with DVT was overlooked, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer and SF for DVT were 95% and 100%, and 61.9% and 53.8%, respectively. When the cutoff value was set at 95% CI of the control (D-dimer, 2.5 microg/mL; SF, 6.9 microg/mL), 2 and 9 patients with DVT were overlooked, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer and SF were 90% and 50%, and 77.6% and 88.3%, respectively. When the cutoff values set at 2.5 microg/mL of D-dimer or 6.9 microg/mL of SF, 1 DVT patient was overlooked, with sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 69.5%.

CD010864,0,15842972,0,Matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in malignant and autoreactive pericardial effusion.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteolytic enzymes essentially involved in tissue remodeling and tumor invasion, and their activity is counterbalanced by endogenous antagonists, the tissue inhibitors of matrix proteinases (TIMPs). Recent reports have suggested a potential role of MMPs in the evolution of pericardial effusion (PE). In this study, we determined the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and their inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in 19 patients who had malignant PE that was confirmed by histology or cytology and 30 patients who had nonmalignant, autoreactive PE compared with pericardial fluid of 19 patients who had preserved left ventricular function and who underwent aortocoronary bypass surgery for control. Samples were assayed by zymography, immunoblotting, and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found significantly higher MMP-2 levels in malignant PE than in pericardial fluid (2,906 +/- 348 vs 1,493 +/- 114 ng/ml, p = 0.0005) or autoreactive PE (2,079 +/- 269 ng/ml, p = 0.01). No significant differences in MMP-9 levels were found between malignant PE and autoreactive PE (83 +/- 28.6 vs 106 +/- 30.4 ng/ml, p = 0.22), whereas MMP-9 was below the detection limit in pericardial fluid. No differences in TIMP-1 levels were found across the different study groups, whereas compared with pericardial fluid, TIMP-2 levels were significantly lower in autoreactive PE (113 +/- 18.9 vs 187 +/- 12.2 ng/ml, p = 0.002). In addition, there was a trend to lower TIMP-2 levels in malignant PE (137 +/- 27.1 ng/ml, p = 0.07). The present findings indicate that proteolytic enzymes and their inhibitors are involved in the pathogenesis of PE, with an expression pattern that depends on etiology. The involvement of MMP-2 in the pathogenesis of malignant PE may indicate a potential role of MMP inhibitors in the control of malignant PE."
CD010864,0,2775454,0,Identification of high molecular weight peptides in bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin granules using monoclonal antibodies to a preproenkephalin A fusion peptide.,"Two mouse monoclonal antibodies (PE-1 and PE-2) raised to a beta-galactosidase-preproenkephalin A(69-207) fusion peptide recognize pro-enkephalin A (pro-enk-A) peptides of 33-5 kDa isolated from bovine adrenal chromaffin granules. The preliminary characterization of the high molecular weight adrenomedullary pro-enk-A peptides recognized by PE-1 and PE-2 is described. The high molecular weight peptides were resolved after Sephadex G-50 chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) into three components (peaks I, II and III). Immunoblot analysis showed each HPLC peak to be heterogeneous. Peak I contained PE-1-and PE-2-immunoreactive peptides of 33, 29, 24 and 22 kDa; peak II contained a peptide of 22 kDa recognized by PE-2, and peptides of 24 and 22 kDa recognized by PE-1; peak III contained a PE-2-immunoreactive peptide of 15 kDa and PE-1-immunoreactive peptide of 18 kDa. Using polyclonal antibodies to peptide F and methionineenkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 (MetEnk-RGL), the 22 kDa band cross-reacted with both MetEnk-RGL and peptide F antibodies, whilst the 24 kDa band was shown to possess predominantly MetEnk-RGL immunoreactivity. The 15 kDa (PE-2-immunoreactive) band was recognized by the peptide F but not the MetEnk-RGL antibody, whereas the polyclonal antibodies did not recognize the 18 kDa (PE-1-immunoreactive) band. We propose that the immunological and size characteristics of some of these peptides (29, 24/22, 15 kDa) suggest their similarity to the peptides of predicted molecular mass 23.3, 18.2 and 12.6 kDa previously found in bovine adrenal medulla. The results also indicate the existence of high molecular weight pro-enk-A peptides shortened at the N-terminus. The use of an immunoradiometric assay designed to measure the proenk-A-derived 18.2 kDa peptide using PE-2 and an affinity purified and radioiodinated MetEnk-RGL IgG has supported these findings."

In the present study we have focused on N-truncated/modified AÎ² peptide bearing amino-terminal pyroglutamate at position 11 (AÎ²N11(pE)). We identified two B-cell epitopes recognized by rabbit anti-AÎ²N11(pE) polyclonal antibodies. Interestingly, rabbit anti-AÎ²N11(pE) polyclonal antibodies bound also to full-length AÎ²1-42 and N-truncated/modified AÎ²N3(pE), suggesting that the three peptides may share a common B-cell epitope. Importantly, rabbit anti-AÎ²N11(pE) antibodies bound to naturally occurring AÎ² aggregates present in brain samples from AD patients. These results are potentially important for developing novel immunogens for targeting N-truncated/modified AÎ² aggregates as well, since the most commonly used immunogens in the majority of vaccine studies have been shown to induce antibodies that recognize the N-terminal immunodominant epitope (EFRH) of the full length AÎ², which is absent in N-amino truncated peptides."
CD010864,0,19074092,0,Duration of anticoagulation therapy for venous thromboembolism.,"Treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism-often denominated together as venous thromboembolism (VTE)- consists of parenteral administration of heparin (usually low-molecular-weight heparin or alternatively unfractionated heparin or fondaparinux) overlapped and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists that are administered for a certain period (usually 3 to 12 months). Recommended or suggested durations differ according to guidelines. Practically, the clinical decision in an individual patient depends upon the estimated risks of VTE recurrence and treatment-induced bleeding. The risk of VTE recurrence is higher in idiopathic events (about 10% per year during the first two years and 3% per year thereafter) (odds ratio of 2.4, compared to secondary events); in male subjects (at least before the age of 60, with an odds ratio of 2-4); in patients with persistently elevated D-dimer level (odds ratio of 2.3, compared with normal level); and during the first two years after discontinuation of treatment. The annual risk of major bleeding on anticoagulant treatment vary largely in observational studies with figures of 2% to 29%, depending on the patient characteristics. The case-fatality rate is 8% (DVT), 12% (PE) for recurrent VTE, and about 10% for major bleed. These figures do not support long-term anticoagulant therapy, except in those patients exhibiting a very high risk of recurrence and/or a very low risk of bleeding. New therapeutic aspects might impact on the duration of anticoagulant therapy after a venous thromboembolic event. They include the possibility of pursuing anticoagulant treatment at a reduced INR after an initial period with an INR 2-3, and the advent of new, more specific and orally active anticoagulants. These features might modify the risk-benefit balance of extending anticoagulant therapy beyond the usual, limited duration."

CD010864,0,19727634,0,[A 17-year-old with cardiac mass and pulmonary embolism].,"A 17-year-old man admitted with recurrent haemoptysis, fever and syncope. He complained about dyspnoea and chest pain since a few weeks. The clinical investigation, ECG and chest X-ray did not show any abnormalities. Laboratory investigations revealed signs of inflammation and increased D-dimer assay. A pulmonary embolism in both lungs with pulmonary infarctions and an intracardial structure in the right atrium were found on the CT-scan of the thorax. The transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed a typical feature of myxoma as a cardiac mass in size of 3.3x3.6 cm in the right atrium attached to the atrial septum. Using cardiopulmonary bypass the tumor excision and the pulmonary embolectomy were performed. The myxoma specimens were histologically detected in the tumor mass as well as in the embolectomy material. The detection of the right atrial myxoma as an uncommon feature of the pulmonary embolism emphasizes the importance of the early echocardiography in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,10517127,0,[D-dimer determination in suspected deep venous thrombosis or lung embolism].,"Cleavage of crosslinked fibrin by the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin leads to the formation of fibrin degradation products, among them D-dimers. D-Dimer can easily be measured in plasma or in whole blood by means of monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes of the D-dimer fragment. Elevated plasma levels of D-dimers are characteristic for patients with venous thromboembolism (DVT, PE), but occur also in patients with infectious diseases, malignant neoplasms and heart failure. Given the high sensitivity of ELISA D-dimer assays with respect to venous thromboembolism it is possible to reliably rule out DVT or PE when the plasma concentration of D-dimer is below the cut-off level. Thus, it is possible to rule out DVT in about 30% of outpatients with suspected venous thromboembolism by the measurement of D-dimer-concentration with a validated assay avoiding further diagnostic procedures."
CD010864,0,19331837,0,The current and continuing important role of ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy in evaluating patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"After the publication of the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) study in 1990, there was considerable controversy concerning the ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) study in regard to its low sensitivity and high number of nondiagnostic examinations when used in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Many lessons have been learned from the PIOPED database that have greatly improved our interpretive skills in the 2 decades since the study was performed. One of the key problems negatively impacting interpretation was the predominantly inpatient population that was studied. Inpatients generally are sicker patients with abnormal chest x-rays. This factor significantly degrades V/Q interpretation. A normal chest x-ray greatly facilitates accurate interpretation of the lung scan. The emergence of computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the early to mid-1990s provided a superb new means of imaging patients with suspected PE. As this technology became more sophisticated with multidetector units, it became the procedure of choice in the great majority of medical centers. CT scanners located in or proximal to many emergency departments as well as its 24/7 availability supported this preference. Within the past 2 to 3 years, the publication of the PIOPED II study as well as some other prospective and retrospective studies have confirmed similar diagnostic accuracy for CTA and V/Q studies. Additionally, there have been several recent publications cautioning physicians about the large radiation dose associated with CTA, particularly to the female breast. Considering the great benefits of both techniques as well as their limitations, it is prudent for both clinicians and imaging physicians to develop an appropriate approach to studying patients with suspected PE. Considerations such as objective clinical assessment, D-dimer assay and the chest x-ray appearance all play significant roles in this decision-making process."
CD010864,0,19331834,0,Pulmonary embolism: a clinician's perspective.,"Recent advances in the management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) have both improved diagnostic accuracy as well as made management algorithms safer and more accessible. Physicians need to more frequently consider PE in patients with chest pain or dyspnea and should be aware of the proper diagnostic approach. Diagnostic strategies should include pretest clinical probability, D-dimer assays, and imaging tests. Although it has been proven that the use of algorithms result in better outcomes, there are patient-specific issues that must be considered. Approaches that use computed tomographic pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning appear equally safe, but each approach has advantages and disadvantages that should be appreciated to provide the best care. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating whether these diagnostic processes can be made even easier and less expensive. Importantly, patients at low risk with a negative D-dimer can avoid imaging tests and those at moderate risk with a negative high sensitivity D-dimer can have venous thromboembolism excluded without the need for imaging. However, these patients also represent those most likely to have false-positive tests and clinically irrelevant PE. V/Q scanning may be more appropriate in premenopausal women, in those with renal dysfunction or diabetes, in those with known contrast allergies, and perhaps in patients with known family history of breast cancer. As with any illness, there is room for improvement in the management of PE, but it remains unknown whether preventive measures, diagnosis, treatment modalities, or physician or patient education should be the focus."

Frequencies of NOS3 G894T, 4b/a and T(-786) --> C, AGT T704C and ACE ins/del polymorphisms were studied in 342 subjects: 120 with preeclampsia (PE), 104 with gestational hypertension and 118 normotensive pregnant women. Variations were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. NO and ACE levels were determined using ELISA. There was no difference in the distribution of individual NOS3 and ACE polymorphisms in the study groups. Haplotype analysis showed a global difference in the NOS3 haplotype distribution between the PE and non-PE subjects (P=0.03). The presence of AGT 704C allele was associated with a reduced risk of developing PE (odds ratio: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.19-0.59 in recessive mode). Circulating total NO and ACE levels were similar in three groups. No relationship was found between circulating NO levels and any of the NOS3 polymorphisms, but the circulating ACE levels were higher in those with DD genotype (P<0.05). In conclusion, there was no association between individual NOS3 and the ACE gene polymorphisms and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in north Indian women. The presence of minor alleles at all the three sites in NOS3 seemed to increase the risk of PE, and AGT 704C allele was associated with a reduced PE risk. The complexity of interaction between these genetic abnormalities requires further studies."

CD010864,0,16802530,0,[Diagnosis and therapy of pulmonary embolism].,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) as a potentially life-threatening condition requires immediate medical intervention. Even the mere suspicion of a PE demands the initiation of a therapy with heparin. According to the patient's hemodynamic stability further diagnostic and therapeutic steps have to be taken. In case of a stable hemodynamic situation both the clinical probability of a PE and diagnostic imaging as well as the determination of D-dimers lead to the diagnosis. These patients should be anticoagulated with heparin. Unstable hemodynamic patients need to be monitored on the intensive care unit; echocardiography and, if needed, spiral computed tomography are the most important diagnostic tools. Due to this serious situation lung artery perfusion needs to be restituted by thrombolysis. Additionally, secondary prevention with vitamin K antagonists (INR [International Normalized Ratio] 2.0-3.0) is recommended depending on anamnesis and accordance to a risk group."
CD010864,0,16778760,0,Submassive acute pulmonary thromboembolism with normal D-dimer. A case report.,"Pulmonary thromboembolism is a relatively common disease in an Emergency Department. Diagnosis, often difficult, is based on careful evaluation of risk factors, clinical examination, radiological and laboratory investigations. Plasma D-dimer, a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin with low specificity and very high sensibility, is considered extremely useful as screening to rule out a pulmonary thromboembolism. We report the case of a 74 year old woman who presented in the Emergency Department suffering from the sudden onset of dyspnea 4 hours before. Plasma D-dimer (automated latex-enhanced turbidimetric test) was normal (253 ng/mL; normal value: 278 ng/mL), but spiral CT angiography showed a sub-massive thromboembolism of the principal branch of the right pulmonary artery, also involving the middle and the inferior lobar branches. A cardiac echo-color-Doppler demonstrated an enlargement of the right cardiac section with telediastolic pressure in the pulmonary artery of 74 mmHg (normal value 4-12 mmHg). A second measurement of plasma D-dimer, 12 hours later, remained in the normal range (274 ng/mL) and only after four days was there a significant increase (1017 ng/mL). The authors, taking the case as a starting point, stigmatize the difficulties that such diagnosis involves, despite indications of guidelines."
CD010864,0,20920637,0,SPECT imaging of pulmonary emboli with radiolabeled thrombus-specific imaging agents.,"The safe and accurate diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) remains challenging, and many PE-related deaths still occur before the detection of PE. Current techniques detect PE as ""negative images,"" ie, the absence of contrast or downstream perfusion. There would be advantages to obtaining ""positive images"" of PE, by targeting imaging agents to components that are present primarily on thromboemboli. In addition to providing alternative means of diagnosing acute PE, they would also enable acute PE to be distinguished from other types of pulmonary arterial obstruction, such as unresolved intravascular defects attributable to previous PE. Positive images of PE require imaging agents to bind onto target antigens that are present predominantly on thromboemboli. The ""D dimer"" regions of polymerized fibrin are present in high concentrations on thromboemboli and are sufficiently accessible to binding. (99m)Tc-lableled anti-D-dimer deimmunized monoclonal antibody Fab' fragments (DI-DD-3B6/22-80B3) bind specifically to thromboemboli, with a thrombus: blood labeling ratio that allows scintigraphic detection. Another thrombus-specific imaging agent is (99m)Tc-labeled apcitide, a synthetic peptide that binds with a high affinity and specificity to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on the membrane of activated platelets. Both of these agents have enabled the detection of lower extremity deep vein thrombi by planar scintigraphy. However, even highly radiolabeled PEs are difficult to distinguish by planar scintigraphy from the large blood pool in the heart and lungs. The spatial and contrast resolution inherent to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning allow the in situ imaging of pulmonary emboli that have been bound by radiolabeled thrombus-specific imaging agents. Preliminary trials in humans with acute PE have shown that the emboli can be detected after intravenous administration of (99m)Tc-lableled anti-D dimer, followed by SPECT scanning. Although clinical results are still preliminary, it appears that imaging of pulmonary emboli with SPECT, after administration of radiolabeled thrombus-specific antibody fragments, is accurate and clinically feasible."

CD010864,0,21496398,0,Role of the quantiferon-TB test in ruling out pleural tuberculosis: a multi-centre study.,"Diagnosing pleural tuberculosis (plTB) might be difficult due to limited sensitivity of conventional microbiology tools. As M. tuberculosis (MTB)-specific T cells are recruited into pleural space in plTB, their detection may provide useful clinical information. To this aim, in addition to standard diagnostic tests, we used the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT) test in blood and pleural effusion (PE) samples from 48 patients with clinical suspicion of plTB, 18 (37.5%) of whom had confirmed plTB. Four of them (22.2%) tested positive with a nucleic acid amplification test for MTB. The tuberculin skin test was positive in most confirmed plTB cases (88.9%). Positive QFT-IT tests were significantly more frequent in patients with confirmed plTB, as compared to patients with an alternative diagnosis, both in blood (77.7 vs 36.6%, p=0.006) and in PE samples (83.3% vs 46.6%, p=0.02). In addition, both blood and PE MTB-stimulated IFN-gamma levels were significantly higher in plTB patients (p=0.03 and p=0.0049 vs non-plTB, respectively). In blood samples, QFT-IT had 77.8% sensitivity and 63.3% specificity, resulting in 56.0% positive (PPV) and 82.6% negative (NPV) predictive values. On PE, QFT-IT sensitivity was 83.3% and specificity 53.3% (PPV 51.7% and NPV 84.2%). The optimal AUC-derived cut-off for MTB-stimulated pleural IFN-gamma level was 3.01 IU/mL (77.8% sensitivity, 80% specificity, PPV 68.4% and NPV 82.8%). These data suggest that QFT-IT might have a role in ruling out plTB in clinical practice."

Routine laboratory diagnosis of PE is done by amplification of L. intracellularis -specific DNA sequences by PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis and staining of PCR products with ethidium bromide. We report the development of an enzyme-linked oligosorbent assay (ELOSA) for specific identification of chromosomal L. intracellularis 328-bp PCR amplified products. The ELOSA involved determination of optical density value at 450 nm (OD(450)) after hybridization of biotin-labelled PCR products with an amine-modified internal oligonucleotide capture probe immobilized in microwell plates, and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. A positive ELOSA cut-off value of > or =0.375 was established using the mean OD(450)of negative control specimens plus three times the standard deviation. Using this value, the detection limit of PCR amplified L. intracellularis -specific products by ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blot, and ELOSA were estimated to be 6.1 ng, between 0.8 and 3.0 ng, and 0.8 ng of DNA, respectively. Comparison of ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel analysis with ELOSA for detection of L. intracellularis -specific PCR products from 315 clinical specimens revealed 78% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 94% accuracy.

CD010864,0,11397854,0,Interleukin-6 differentially stimulates haptoglobin production by peritoneal and endometriotic cells in vitro: a model for endometrial-peritoneal interaction in endometriosis.,"Based on our previous observation that peritoneal endometriotic (PE) lesions synthesize in vivo substantially more haptoglobin (Hp) than related eutopic tissues, we hypothesized that this increase in Hp production was due to endometrial-peritoneal interactions. As interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulates Hp in other tissues and is produced by endometrial cells, we tested our hypothesis by evaluating the effects of IL-6 on Hp production by PE cells, normal peritoneal (P) cells, and eutopic endometrial cells from women with (UE-E) and without endometriosis (UE-C) using semiquantitative RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. Endogenous production of IL-6 was also assessed. Treatment with human recombinant IL-6 and dexamethasone significantly increased Hp production by P or PE cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Hp messenger ribonucleic acid was not detected in UE-E and UE-C cells in the absence or presence of IL-6 and dexamethasone. PE and UE-E cells expressed significantly more IL-6 messenger ribonucleic acid than P and UE-C cells (P < 0.05). Moreover, UE-E cells secreted 6 times more IL-6 protein than UE-C cells (P < 0.05). These findings support our hypothesis and suggest a novel endometrial-peritoneal interaction whereby locally synthesized IL-6 and Hp may participate in the establishment and persistence of peritoneal endometriosis."
CD010864,0,18573524,0,Analysis of the metabolic footprint and tissue metabolome of placental villous explants cultured at different oxygen tensions reveals novel redox biomarkers.,"Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a multi-system disorder of pregnancy hypothesised to arise from circulating factors derived from an unhealthy placenta. Some changes in placental phenotype seen in PE can be reproduced by culture in altered oxygen (O2) tension. Currently, these circulating factors are unidentified, partly due to the complexity of maternal plasma. Investigation of factors released from placental tissue provides a potential method to identify bioactive compounds. Experimental strategies to study compounds present in a biological system have expanded greatly in recent years. Metabolomics can detect and identify endogenous and secreted metabolites. We aimed to determine whether metabolites could be identified in placental cultures with acceptable experimental variability and to determine whether altered O2 tension affects the composition of the placental metabolome. In this study we used gas-chromatography-mass spectroscopy to determine the presence of metabolites in conditioned culture medium (CCM) and tissue lysates of placental villous explants cultured in 1, 6 and 20% atmospheric O2 for 96h. This experimental strategy had an intra-assay variation of 6.1-11.6%. Intra and inter-placental variability were 15.7-35.8% and 44.8-46.2% respectively. Metabolic differences were identified between samples cultured in 1, 6 and 20% O2 in both CCM and tissue lysate. Differentially expressed metabolites included: 2-deoxyribose, threitol or erythritol and hexadecanoic acid. We conclude that metabolomic strategies offer a novel approach to investigate placental function. When conducted under carefully controlled conditions, with appropriate statistical analysis, metabolic differences can be identified in placental explants in response to altered O2 tension. Metabolomics could be used to identify changes in conditions associated with placental pathology."
CD010864,0,10907438,0,[The value of biological and clinical signs of pulmonary embolism].,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is often underdiagnosed, mainly because it is not thought of. Its clinical signs are not highly specific and are encountered in a wide range of pulmonary diseases. Certain symptoms and signs, particularly when combined, are suggestive of PE: unexplained dyspnea, pleuretic pain with or without hemoptysis, tachypnea, etc. but they are not pathognomonic. Routine laboratory investigations such as arterial blood gas analysis, total blood cell count, serum LDH, etc. ... contribute poorly to making the diagnosis. D-dimers are fibrin degradation products. It has now been made possible to rule out PE in almost 20% of suspected cases, when plasma D-dimers levels are lower than 500 ng/ml, using the ELISA technique, with a very high sensitivity rate (98%). On the other hand, their specificity and positive predictive value are low (< 50%) and under no circumstances should their measurement be used to confirm the diagnosis of PE.

Fifty-six of the patients presented clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis. Diagnosis was confirmed in 26 of the 56 patients with a D-dimer level above 370 ng/ml (sensitivity 92.3%) and 370 ng/ml for 13 of 30 patients with a negative venous ultrasound Doppler examination (specificity 43.3%).

In 40 cases with suspected pulmonary embolis, either alone or with suspected deep vein thrombosis, diagnosis was made in only 4 of 9 with a highly or intermediately probable ventilation/perfusion scan. D-dimer level was always above 3,000 ng/ml.

CD010864,0,11931491,0,Proinflammatory cytokines are not released in the circulation following acute pulmonary thromboembolism in pigs.,"Histological examination of acute lung injury associated with sepsis often revealed thromboembolic lesions in the pulmonary microcirculation. Several inflammatory mediators such as platelet activating factor, thromboxane, and endothelins have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute pulmonary thromboembolism (APTE). In the present study we examined the roles of three proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), and IL-8, in the early phase of APTE. APTE was induced in 13 anesthetized piglets (22+/-4 kg) by injecting thrombin-induced blood clots directly into the left lower lobar pulmonary artery. Five animals that received only warm sterile saline served as controls. Arterial plasma samples were collected regularly over 8 h so that cytokine levels could be measured later by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Administration of clots doubled the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (from 13+/-5 to 26+/-7 mm Hg) and caused significant decrease in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2 from 390+/-85 to 256+/-89 mm Hg while the FiO2 was maintained at 1.0). Mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output remained comparable throughout the experiments after initial fluid resuscitation. Plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 were not significantly increased in the APTE group when compared with their baseline values or the control group. Our results thus show that APTE is associated with pulmonary hypertension and deterioration of gas exchange but not with the systemic release of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, or IL-8. We conclude that these cytokines have minimal impact on the systemic circulation during APTE."

CD010864,0,15536380,0,[The COPD-PE study: prevalence and prediction of pulmonary embolism in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].,"Patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are often admitted to hospital with an exacerbation of their disease that manifests itself with an increase in cough and/or sputum, increased dyspnoea and sometimes chest pain. These episodes are most often attributed to an acute exacerbation of bronchial infection but the real cause is often unknown. COPD is considered a risk factor for pulmonary embolism (PE) and PE is part of the differential diagnosis of an acute exacerbation of COPD. However, the symptoms of these two conditions overlap to a considerable extent and the investigation of PE is often ignored in these patients. Therefore the true prevalence of PE in this situation is unknown. Nevertheless several small series suggest that up to 30% of patients seen as emergencies with exacerbations of COPD may have a deep vein thrombosis or PE. The aims of this study are therefore: 1. To evaluate the prevalence of PE in patients admitted as emergencies with exacerbations of COPD; and 2. To attempt to develop a prediction guide for PE in this population in order to identify the patients in whom PE should be investigated."

This was a prospective observational pilot study of emergency department patients evaluated for PE. Patients evaluated for PE had pretest probability assessed by the Wells PE Score. High pretest probability was defined as: dichotomized Wells Score>4 points and patients with trichotomized Wells Score>6 points. Patients had an ELISA D-dimer ordered by the treating physician. Pulmonary embolism was defined as: positive computed tomography scan, high probability ventilation/perfusion scan, positive pulmonary angiogram, or PE on 3-month follow-up. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and likelihood ratios for the ELISA D-dimer. We prospectively enrolled 541 patients who underwent D-dimer testing for PE, of whom 130 patients had Wells Score>4 and 33 patients had Wells Score>6 (not mutually exclusive). Of subjects with Wells Score>4, 23 (18%) were diagnosed with PE and 40 (31%) had a negative D-dimer. No patient with Wells Score>4 (sensitivity 100%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 82%-100%; specificity 37%, 95% CI 28%-47%) or Wells Score>6 (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 63%-100%; specificity 56%, 95% CI 35%-76%) who had a negative D-dimer was diagnosed with PE. The likelihood ratio for a negative D-dimer was 0 for both the Wells>4, and Wells>6 groups, however, the upper limits of the confidence interval around the post-test probability for PE were 16% and 33%, respectively, for these high probability groups. In this pilot study, the rapid ELISA D-dimer had high sensitivity and negative predictive value even when applied to patients with high pretest probability for PE. However, with the post-test probability of PE still as high as 16-33% in the negative D-dimer groups, this precludes applying the results to patient care at present. Further testing is warranted to determine whether these findings can be safely incorporated into practice."
CD010864,0,23591793,0,How I diagnose acute pulmonary embolism.,"The clinical diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently considered in patients presenting to the emergency department or when hospitalized. Since symptoms are a-specific and the consequences of anticoagulant treatment are considerable, objective tests to either establish or refute the diagnosis have become a standard of care. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), which has replaced pulmonary angiography as first-line imaging test, is associated with radiation exposure, several complications resulting from contrast dye administration, and over diagnosis. Importantly, CTPA can be avoided in 20% to 30% of patients who present with a first or recurrent episode of clinically suspected acute PE by using a standardized algorithm. This algorithm should always include a clinical decision rule to assess the likelihood that PE is present, followed by a D-dimer blood test and/or CTPA. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians this practical diagnostic management approach using evidence from the literature."

One monoclonal antibody was selected due to its high yield of conjugate, titre and stability. The use of monoclonal antibodies increased assay sensitivity, precision and allowed assay simplification by the simultaneous rather than sequential incubation of CRP and conjugate. Comparison with nephelometry and CRP binding to PE assay using polyclonals gave correlations greater than or equal to 0.9. By using monoclonal conjugates to assay human sera, healthy adult CRP levels were found to be lower than by using polyclonal conjugates. Samples with very low CRP contents might now be assayed with higher precision."
CD010864,0,20024639,0,Troponins and high-sensitivity troponins as markers of necrosis in CAD and heart failure.,"For years, cardiac troponins (cTn) have been regarded as the preferred biomarkers for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and for the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndromes, as well as for the selection of patients who need an early invasive strategy, and for the guidance of adjunctive pharmacological therapy. In addition, measurement of cTn has been found useful for detection of myocardial necrosis in conditions unrelated to myocardial ischemia including acute pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, heart failure, sepsis, and end-stage renal disease. In these conditions, an unfavorable prognosis is unequivocally associated with detectable concentrations of cTn.A major limitation of most currently available cTn assays is the lack of adequate precision, i.e., to measure cTn concentrations at the 99th percentile value with a coefficient of variation < 10%. As a consequence, many manufacturers have developed more sensitive cTn assays that now comply with precision criteria required by the Joint European Society of Cardiology/ American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/World Heart Federation Task Force for the Redefinition of Acute Myocardial Infarction.Using assays with higher analytic sensitivity more patients will be seen in clinical practice with the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (TnThs) above the 99th percentile discriminator. The causes of these elevations may be due to acute, subacute and chronic cardiac disease such as heart failure or cardiomyopathies."
CD010864,0,10775026,0,Rapid ELISA D-dimer testing in the exclusion of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients.,"The clinical diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is known to be unreliable. Until now, no biological marker has been found to confirm thrombosis, but help can be gained from a biological marker ruling out the diagnosis of DVT or PE, i.e., the sensitive measurement of D-dimer (DD) species. This article summarizes our experience in introducing a rapid D-dimer test (ELISA VIDAS D-dimÃ¨res test, bioMÃ©rieux) in a collaborative strategy for thrombosis diagnosis during 9 consecutive months involving 1,131 measurements. The efficacy of the DD test was very different according the type of patient, and departments where the DD test provides a real diagnostic benefit were identified. High clinical probability for thrombosis was encountered in 32 patients and radiology was carried out, although D-dimer was negative: none of these patients was found to have a thrombosis after radiologic examination. However, extensive progress must be made in test prescription to reduce the excessive rate of positive D-dimer tests (78%) and positive measurements that are not followed up by radiology (42%)."
CD010864,0,18854808,0,Predictors and risk factors of pre-eclampsia.,"Understanding the mechanisms of disease responsible for the syndrome of pre-eclampsia (PE) as well as early risk assessment is still a major challenge. Risk factors for PE are nulliparity, a family or own history of PE, pre-existing diabetes or increased body mass index, multiple pregnancy, maternal age, renal disease, hypertension or raised blood pressure at booking and chronic autoimmune disease. Other factors are thrombophilias and insulin resistance together with obesity. On the other hand identification of predictors of the development of pre-eclampsia would enhance the ability to diagnose women likely to develop pre-eclampsia before the onset of the disease and would improve their monitoring and enable to convey them to randomized trials for evaluating prophylactic treatment. A number of biochemical agents have been assessed as markers for predicting pre-eclampsia. None of them has been proved to be of clinical value yet. Much effort has been put into evaluating novel potential markers and their combination with other screening methods such as Doppler sonography. The most promising biochemical markers, to date, are placenta protein 13 (PP-13) as well as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng). These markers allow screening at a relatively early stage and, most importantly, show relatively high predictive values and improved diagnostic performance if combined with first trimester Doppler sonography. However, until now, too little data are available to justify the clinical use of these markers. Large-scale prospective studies, assessing these markers, are important to advance progress in reducing maternal and perinatal morbidity and relieving the heavy burden of pre-eclampsia."
CD010864,0,9763357,0,Rapid D-dimer assays to exclude deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: current status and new developments.,"Studies measuring the fibrin degradation product D-Dimer (DD) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in patients suspected of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) suggest that it is possible to exclude DVT/PE when the DD level is below a certain cut-off value. However, ELISA methods are time-consuming, bare high costs, and are only available in experienced laboratories. For this reason several rapid and less costly DD assays have been recently developed. This article reviews the current literature about rapid latex and ELISA DD assays in the diagnostic approach of DVT and PE. Two new latex assays seem suitable in clinical practice. The most extensively studied assay is the so-called SimpliRed DD, an autologous red cell agglutination test that can be performed on fresh whole blood. For DVT a sensitivity (Sens) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 89-100% and 95-100%, respectively, have been reported, for PE 94-100% and 98-100%, respectively. The second test, Tinaquant, is a quantitative latex assay. Sens and NPV for DVT of 99% and 93% have been reported in one study. Two rapid ELISA assays have been investigated. The most extensively studied is the VIDAS DD assay, a fully automated quantitative ELISA method. Sens and NPV of 94-100% and 92-100% for DVT and both 100% for PE have been reported. For the other rapid ELISA, Instant IA DD, Sens and NPV of 92-93% and 76-77% have been reported for DVT. The last one is a qualitative assay giving only positive or negative results. These results show that low concentrations of plasma DD measured by especially SimpliRed or VIDAS DD, might be used to reliably rule out DVT or PE in clinically suspected patients. Tinaquant seems promising and has to be evaluated further. As for standard ELISA, increased DD concentrations are of no use because of the low specificity of the assays. Future studies should assess the clinical usefulness of both assays in management trials under routine conditions, in the frame of clinical decision-making diagnostic processes to prove that withholding further noninvasive testing and/or anticoagulants in patients with a low or negative DD is safe. Strategies to identify patients with false-negative results should be developed."

CD010864,0,9763359,0,The place of D-dimer testing in an integrated approach of patients suspected of pulmonary embolism.,"When a patient is suspected of having pulmonary embolism (PE), the first procedure performed in most institutions is lung scintigraphy. Here we propose an alternative diagnostic strategy based on the following sequential combination of procedures: clinical assessment, D-dimer measurement, ultrasonography of lower limbs, and lung scan. This integrated approach may rule out PE in the majority of outpatients suspected of PE and permits district hospitals without lung-scan facilities to manage approximately 50% of outpatients without referral. D-dimer alone will exclude PE in about 30% of patients at low cost. This stepwise strategy is especially useful because only 20-35% of patients suspected of PE really have the disease. Thus, in the majority of patients, ruling out the disease has replaced ruling in the disease."
CD010864,0,19335103,0,Evaluation of the usefulness of an ELISA and protein electrophoresis in the diagnosis of Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection in rabbits.,"OBJECTIVE-To evaluate the usefulness of an antibody detection ELISA and protein electrophoresis (PE) for diagnosing Encephalitozoon cuniculi (ECUN) infection in pet rabbits. ANIMALS-203 pet rabbits. PROCEDURES-Serum and plasma samples from pet rabbits were submitted from veterinary clinics within the United States. Participating veterinarians completed a questionnaire that was used to classify rabbits as clinically normal (n=33), suspected of having an ECUN infection (103), or clinically abnormal but not suspected of having an ECUN infection (67). An ELISA for detection of serum or plasma IgG against ECUN was developed by use of commercially available reagents. Results of the ELISA and PE were used to detect ECUN infection. RESULTS-A high seroprevalence of antibody against ECUN was detected in all 3 groups of rabbits. In rabbits suspected of having an ECUN infection, the mean IgG titer was 1.7 times as high as the values in the other rabbit groups. Rabbits suspected of having an ECUN infection and those that were simply clinically abnormal had a higher concentration of gamma-globulins than clinically normal rabbits. This increase in globulins concentration was accompanied by a decrease in the albumin-to-globulin ratio. Results of the ELISA and PE were significantly different between clinically normal rabbits and those suspected of having an ECUN infection. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-The combination of an ELISA and PE may aid in the diagnosis of ECUN infection in pet rabbits. IMPACT FOR HUMAN MEDICINE-Because ECUN is a potential zoonotic agent, diagnostic methods for pet rabbits need to be improved to protect human health."
CD010864,0,22082522,0,Mortality risk assessment and the role of thrombolysis in pulmonary embolism.,"Acute venous thromboembolism remains a frequent disease, with an incidence ranging between 23 and 69 cases per 100,000 population per year. Of these patients, approximately one-third present with clinical symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and two-thirds with deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Recent registries and cohort studies suggest that approximately 10% of all patients with acute PE die during the first 1 to 3 months after diagnosis. Overall, 1% of all patients admitted to hospitals die of acute PE, and 10% of all hospital deaths are PE-related. These facts emphasize the need to better implement our knowledge on the pathophysiology of the disease, recognize the determinants of death or major adverse events in the early phase of acute PE, and most importantly, identify those patients who necessitate prompt medical, surgical, or interventional treatment to restore the patency of the pulmonary vasculature."

CD010864,0,21958741,0,Usefulness of admission red cell distribution width as a predictor of early mortality in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.,"Red cell distribution width (RDW) is strongly associated with prognosis in cardiopulmonary disorders such as coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, acute and chronic heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. However, its prognostic significance in acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between admission RDW and early mortality in patients with acute PE. One hundred sixty-five patients with confirmed acute PE were included. Patients with previous treatment for anemia, malignancy, or chronic liver disease, those with dialysis treatment for chronic renal failure, and those who received erythrocyte suspension for any reason were excluded. A total of 136 consecutive patients with acute PE were evaluated prospectively. According to receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal cut-off value of RDW to predict early mortality was >14.6%, with 95.2% sensitivity and 53% specificity. Patients were categorized prospectively as having unchanged (group 1) or increased (group 2) RDW on the basis of a cut-off value of 14.6%. The mean age of patients was 63 Â± 15 years. The mean follow-up duration was 11 Â± 7 days, and 21 patients died. Among these 21 patients, 1 (1.6%) was in group 1 and 20 (27%) were in group 2 (p <0.001). Increased RDW >14.6% on admission, age, presence of shock, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and creatinine level were found to have prognostic significance in univariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis. Only increased RDW >14.6% on admission (hazard ratio 15.465, p = 0.012) and the presence of shock (hazard ratio 9.354, p <0.001) remained associated with increased risk for acute PE-related early mortality in a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model. In conclusion, high RDW was associated with worse hemodynamic parameters, and RDW seems to aid in the risk stratification of patients with acute PE."

Since there are no studies regarding the evaluation of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in women with a history of PE, we focused on the evaluation of lipid profile and oxLDL plasma concentration several years after pregnancy to see if these women have any modifications in these parameters that may be linked to the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the future. Ninety women with a history of PE and 60 controls in a median interval of 6 years after pregnancy were recruited. Plasma oxLDL levels were measured using a two-site enzyme immunoassay. Concentration of cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), HDL-cholesterol (HDLc) and LDL-cholesterol (LDLc) were measured by automated enzymatic assays. To evaluate apoA and apoB levels automated immunoturbidimetric assays were used. In the group of women with a history of PE, gestational age at delivery was significantly earlier in comparison with the control group, whereas birth weight was significantly lower and there were more caesarean sections. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly higher in women with a history of PE than in the control group. Significantly higher obesity anthropometric markers (BMI and waist-to-hip ratio) were found in women with a history of PE. As consistent with other authors' findings, blood pressure was higher in these women, but lipid profile did not seem to play a role in the increased risk of cardiovascular disease."

CD010864,0,9273202,0,[Prevalence of thrombosis in secondary antiphospholipid-protein syndrome].,"Antiphospholipid-protein syndrome (APS) comprises venous and arterial thrombosis, spontaneous abortion and thrombocytopenia in patients with antiphospholipid-protein antibodies (APA). Such antibodies are detected by immunoenzymatic (ELISA) methods (e.g. anticardiolipin antibodies-ACL) or coagulation assays (lupus anticoagulant-LA). APS in patients showing other symptoms of autoimmune disease is called secondary antiphospholipid-protein syndrome. The aim of the study was to find relation between history of thrombosis and APA in a group of patients with lupus erythematosus and lupus-like disease. Lupus anticoagulant was detected by a three step procedure using phospholipid dependent clotting assays and anticardiolipin antibodies were measured by ELISA. We studied 95 subjects (91 women, 4 men) suffering from lupus erythematosus (67 patients) and lupus-like-disease (28 patients). Lupus anticoagulant was found in 26, anticardiolipin antibodies IgG in 34 and IgM in 27 subjects. In a retrospective study 40 thrombotic events were detected in 36 patients; deep vein thrombosis in 19, pulmonary embolism in 7, ischaemic CNS events in 13 and myocardial infarction in one. Thrombosis was present more often in subjects with LA (61%) and ACL IgG (52%) than in subjects without these antibodies (24%) (p = 0.004 and 0.015, respectively). ACL IgM antibodies were not related to thrombotic episodes. The ACL IgG antibodies and LA are helpful in identifying subjects at risk factors of venous and arterial thrombosis among patients suffering from lupus erythematosus and lupus-like disease."
CD010864,0,12740506,0,Laboratory tests in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) requires objective testing. However, all imaging techniques have their own limitations and costs and cannot be performed in every patient with suspected PE. After decades of unfruitful research, several laboratory tests have been evaluated for suspected PE, the most promising being the D-dimer test. As a general rule, the specificity of D-dimers is too low to confirm PE. Conversely, several (but not all) D-dimer assays have a high sensitivity for diagnosing PE. Outcome studies indicate that the Vidas D-dimer and SimpliRED D-dimer can be used safely to withdraw anticoagulation when the pretest probability of PE is low (SimpliRED) or when it is low or moderate (Vidas). These results may however not apply to other D-dimer assays and clinicians should know the characteristics of the test used in their hospital. Blood gas analysis does not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to confirm or exclude PE, but it may be used to evaluate the clinical probability of PE before other testing is done. The diagnostic value of the alveolar dead space fraction in patients with suspected PE is currently investigated. Initial data suggest that it needs to be combined with a D-dimer test to safely exclude PE. Brain natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin have limited usefulness for diagnosing PE, but both tests may identify patients with a poor prognosis, in whom more aggressive treatment may be warranted."

CD010864,0,21169615,0,Troponin elevation in coronary vs. non-coronary disease.,"Acute myocardial infarction is defined as myocardial cell death due to prolonged myocardial ischaemia. Cardiac troponins (cTn) are the most sensitive and specific biochemical markers of myocardial injury and with the new high-sensitivity troponin methods very minor damages on the heart muscle can be detected. However, elevated cTn levels indicate cardiac injury, but do not define the cause of the injury. Thus, cTn elevations are common in many disease states and do not necessarily indicate the presence of a thrombotic acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In the clinical work it may be difficult to interpret dynamic changes of troponin in conditions such as stroke, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acute perimyocarditis, Tako-tsubo, acute heart failure, and tachycardia. There are no guidelines to treat patients with elevated cTn levels and no coronary disease. The current strategy of treatment of patients with elevated troponin and non-acute coronary syndrome involves treating the underlying causes. The aim of this paper is to review data from studies of non-ACS patients with acutely elevated troponin who in clinical practice may be difficult to discriminate from ACS patients."

In this article we present a succinct review of diagnostic tools, risk stratification and medical therapies for cardiovascular care of patients with acute PE. While pulmonary angiography remains the 'gold standard' for diagnosis, a host of diagnostic modalities, interpreted in the setting of clinical probability, are available for patient assessment, including ECG, chest radiography, D-dimer, lower-extremity venous ultrasound, ventilation-perfusion scans, computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography, and echocardiography, each with associated value. Diagnostic algorithms incorporate multiple tools in order to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation. Therapeutic anticoagulation remains the mainstay of therapy in PE. In massive PE, utilization of thrombolysis is reasonable in the absence of contraindications. Submassive PE, characterized by right ventricular dysfunction as assessed by echocardiography and ECG, is associated with higher mortality. Use of thrombolysis in submassive PE remains controversial. Catheter-directed therapies are emerging as an added approach to acute PE and have the potential to improve outcomes in PE. Use of inferior vena cava filters should be pursued in a select patient population as they serve to reduce recurrent acute PE; however, they are associated with more frequent deep venous thrombosis and provide no mortality benefit. In risk-stratified hemodynamically stable patients, an outpatient management strategy inclusive of therapeutic anticoagulation and careful clinical follow-up may be appropriate."

To this purpose 25 pre-eclamptic women and 25 healthy parturient women of similar age were evaluated for: IL-18 levels, by ELISAH. pylori seropositivity, by anti-IgG ELISAAnti-Cag-A antibodies using a commercial immunoblot assay.We report similar values of IL-18 in our pre-eclamptic patients and in healthy parturient women (respectively 350 +/- 150 vs. 399 +/- 132 pg ml(-1); p = 0.23). However the seropositivity for H. pylori was 84 and 32% (p < 0.001), and anti-Cag-A antibodies were present respectively in 80 and 28% of the two populations. On the basis of our data we hypothesize that H. pylori infection from Cag-A strains can be involved in some cases of PE and that the microorganism could modulate IL-18 release. In fact, differences on IL-18 production have been described by different authors between pre-eclamptic and healthy pregnant women, independently from infective pathology."
CD010864,0,20463534,0,Diagnosing pulmonary embolism: new computed tomography applications.,"Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography has become the standard of care for the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). In addition to the direct depiction or exclusion of a pulmonary embolus in suspected PE, a number of predictive markers have been established to evaluate the patient's prognosis in acute and in chronic PE. An accurate risk stratification based on CT findings is crucial because optimal management, monitoring, and therapeutic strategies depend on the prognosis. With the recent introduction of the so-called ""dual-source"" CT scanners, that is, a scanner consisting of 2 tubes and 2 detectors mounted orthogonally to each other, different tube voltages can be used simultaneously, resulting in different energies of the emitted x-ray spectra (dual-energy CT; DECT). Initial results have shown that DECT is capable of iodine mapping of the pulmonary parenchyma, reliably depicting the segmental defects in iodine distribution in locations corresponding to embolic vessel occlusions. This study deals with a number of actual topics on PE imaging with multidetector CT and DECT, including the discussion of the relevant imaging findings to assess the patient's prognosis, the potential and additional benefit of dual-energy information on the parenchymal iodine distribution, the optimization of scan protocols including low-radiation dose chest pain protocols, and the discussion on future perspectives of CT in PE patients, such as the role of computer-aided diagnostic tools or the potential of ventilation imaging with DECT."

Mortality reaches about 17% within the first 3 months. Acute pulmonary embolism is characterized by an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and an impairment of the pulmonary gas exchange. Elevation of the right cardiac pressure up to right heart decompensation may follow. In addition, hypoxemia, hyperventilation, dead space ventilation, right to left shunting, bronchoconstriction, and vasoconstriction may occur. Clinical examination, ECG, laboratory findings such as elevated D-dimer, blood gas analysis, ultrasound examination of the veins of the lower extremities, and transthoracic echocardiography are acutely available diagnostic methods of an emergency department. In addition, extensive diagnostic procedures like pulmonary scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography may be required. The aim is to get a definite diagnosis as quickly as possible to direct therapy. In acute pulmonary embolism with cardiac shock, monitoring and stabilization of the circulatory function as well as an appropriate anticoagulant therapy are essential. In some cases surgery or a local fibrinolytic intervention is indicated."

PTEs are reported to be both abundant and persistent and so may serve as long-term markers of genotoxicity. Previously, we reported a 32P-postlabeling assay for the specific detection of PTEs plus identification of nucleosides located 5' to PTEs. Using this, we demonstrated the nonrandom nature of ethyl-PTEs (Et-PTEs) in vivo, these results being suggestive of either the nonrandom formation of Et-PTEs in vivo or sequence specific Et-PTE repair. Presently, we report the further development and validation of the 32P-postlabeling assay, to permit the more straightforward determination of nucleosides 5' to PTEs and, using this, have investigated the long-term persistence of PTEs in vivo. Analysis of liver DNA of mice treated in vivo with N-nitrosodiethylamine reveals an initial decline in the level of Et-PTEs (t1/2<24 h) as well as their nonrandom persistence for the duration of the time course, with approximately 37 and approximately 15% of the initial Et-PTEs remaining 4 and 56 days after treatment, respectively. From this, we conclude that Et-PTEs are suitable as long-term markers of genotoxic exposure and that putative PTE repair is not responsible for their nonrandom manifestation. However, the possibility of active repair contributing to the initial decline of Et-PTEs is considered."

CD010864,0,15199504,0,Pulmonary embolism diagnosis in hospitalized and intensive care unit patients.,"The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) remains difficult, and diagnostic strategies must consider the unique challenges of hospitalized and critically ill patients. Diagnostic algorithms that are effective and safe for outpatients may not be effective and safe for inpatients or patients in intensive care units. For example, serial compression ultrasonography (US) of the lower extremities may allow physicians to avoid pulmonary angiography for stable inpatients or outpatients, but this strategy is not validated for patients who require intensive care for serious underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Helical computed tomography (CT) is particularly suited for the evaluation of suspected PE for inpatients with serious cardiopulmonary disease. However, the safety of withholding treatment when a helical CT pulmonary angiogram is negative remains to be demonstrated. Lung perfusion and ventilation scans combined with an assessment of pretest probability remain important objective tests for the evaluation of many hospitalized patients."

CD010864,0,22203747,0,Hydroxysteroid (17-Î²) dehydrogenase 1 is dysregulated by miR-210 and miR-518c that are aberrantly expressed in preeclamptic placentas: a novel marker for predicting preeclampsia.,"In this study, to search for novel preeclampsia (PE) biomarkers, we focused on microRNA expression and function in the human placenta complicated with PE. By comprehensive analyses of microRNA expression, we identified 22 microRNAs significantly upregulated in preeclamptic placentas, 5 of which were predicted in silico to commonly target the mRNA encoding hydroxysteroid (17-Î²) dehydrogenase 1 (HSD17B1), a steroidogenetic enzyme expressed predominantly in the placenta. In vivo HSD17B1 expression, at both the mRNA and protein levels, was significantly decreased in preeclamptic placentas. Of these microRNAs, miR-210 and miR-518c were experimentally validated to target HSD17B1 by luciferase assay, real-time PCR, and ELISA. Furthermore, we found that plasma HSD17B1 protein levels in preeclamptic pregnant women reflected the decrease of its placental expression. Moreover, a prospective cohort study of plasma HSD17B1 revealed a significant reduction of plasma HSD17B1 levels in pregnant women at 20 to 23 and 27 to 30 weeks of gestation before PE onset compared with those with normal pregnancies. The sensitivities/specificities for predicting PE at 20 to 23 and 27 to 30 weeks of gestation were 0.75/0.67 (cutoff value=21.9 ng/mL) and 0.88/0.51 (cutoff value=30.5 ng/mL), and the odds ratios were 6.09 (95% CI: 2.35-15.77) and 7.83 (95% CI: 1.70-36.14), respectively. We conclude that HSD17B1 is dysregulated by miR-210 and miR-518c that are aberrantly expressed in preeclamptic placenta and that reducing plasma level of HSD17B1 precedes the onset of PE and is a potential prognostic factor for PE."

CD010864,0,16849000,0,Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in orthopedic surgery.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is manifested as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), represents a significant cause of death, disability, and discomfort. They are frequent complications of various surgical procedures. The aging population and the survival of more severely injured patients may suggest an increasing risk of thromboembolism in the trauma patients. Expanded understanding of the population at risk challenges physicians to carefully examine risk factors for VTE to identify high-risk patients who can benefit from prophylaxis. An accurate knowledge of evidence-based risk factors is important in predicting and preventing postoperative DVT, and can be incorporated into a decision support system for appropriate thromboprophylaxis use. Standard use of DVT prophylaxis in a high-risk trauma population leads to a low incidence of DVT. The incidence of VTE is common in Asia. The evaluation includes laboratory tests, Doppler test and phlebography. Screening Doppler sonography should be performed for surveillance on all critically injured patients to identify DVT. D-Dimer is a useful marker to monitor prophylaxis in trauma surgery patients. The optimal time to start prophylaxis is between 2 hours before and 10 hours after surgery, but the risk of PE continues for several weeks. Thromboprophylaxis includes graduated compression stockings and anticoagulants for prophylaxis. Anticoagulants include Warfarin, which belongs to Vitamin K antagonists, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins, factor Xa indirect inhibitor Fondaparinux, and the oral IIa inhibitor Melagatran and ximelagatran. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin is a new and highly effective antithrombotic agent. Prophylactic placement of vena caval filters in selected trauma patients may decrease the incidence of PE. The indications for prophylactic inferior vena cava filter insertion include prolonged immobilization with multiple injuries, closed head injury, pelvic fracture, spine fracture, multiple long bone fracture, and attending discretion. Multiple-trauma patients are at increased risk for DVT but are also at increased risk of bleeding, and the use of heparin may be contraindicated. Serial compression devices (SCDs) are an alternative for DVT prophylaxis. Compression devices provide adequate DVT prophylaxis with a low failure rate and no device-related complications. Immobilization is one of important reasons of VTE. The ambulant patient is far less likely to develop complications of inactivity, not only venous thrombosis, but also contractures, decubitus ulcers, or osteoporosis (with its associated fatigue fractures), as well as bowel or bladder complications."

CD010864,0,15199502,0,Diagnostic strategies for suspected pulmonary embolism among outpatients.,"Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) has been made easier, less invasive, and somewhat safer over the past 2 decades. This has been due mainly to the development of lung scan and to the recognition of VTE as an entity comprising deep vein thrombosis and PE. The prevalence of the disease in patients clinically suspected of PE has steadily decreased during the past 10 years. This has led to the development of diagnostic tools that aim at reducing the number of unnecessary pulmonary angiograms. These include clinical probability assessment and fibrin D-dimer. Several strategies combining these tools have been validated in large outcome studies and compared in a formal cost-effectiveness analysis. The results indicate that they should now be implemented in daily practice taking into account local facilities and expertise. The exact place of helical computed tomography in such sequential algorithms remains to be established."

All patients (n=180) with a hospital discharge diagnosis of PE that were admitted through the ED during 1997 to 1999 were included. Overall test frequency and distribution, ancillary testing used when the initial ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan or spiral computed tomography (sCT) angiogram was nondiagnostic, concordance of V/Q and sCT, and sensitivities of D-dimer assays, arterial blood gas analysis, and deep venous imaging were assessed. There was a wide discrepancy in practice, most pronounced when first-line radiological studies were nondiagnostic. There was a poor correlation of PE detection between sCT and V/Q. D-dimer assay, arterial blood gas analysis, and deep venous imaging are insensitive tests for PE, and ""gold standard"" pulmonary angiography is rarely used."
CD010864,0,9019310,0,[Drainage of loculated and/or multiloculated pleural effusions using a small caliber catheter and urokinase (pleuro-fibrinolysis)].,"The main causes of pleural fluid drainage failure are known to be the formation of fibrin septa, increased viscosity in pleural fluid and inappropriate placement of chest tubes. Reports also tell us that such problems can be solved by using ultrasound as a guide for tube placement and by infusing intrapleural fibrinolytic agents to prevent the formation of septa and reduce the viscosity of pleural fluid. To assess our experience, the role and efficacy of administering intercavitary urokinase (UK) through a small caliber catheter (SCC) implanted with ultrasound guidance as part of the treatment for pleural effusions (PE) that are multiloculated and/or loculated. Fifty multiloculated and/or loculated PE were drained through a pig-tail type SCC between 8.2 and 10 F caliber inserted with ultrasound guidance. The criteria for prescribing the procedure were as follows: PE of any etiology with ultrasound confirmation of fibrin septa and/or multiloculation and absence of contraindication off UK administration. UK was given at a dose of 100,000 i.u. every two hours until disappearance of PE. Before and after treatment the levels of D-dimer were measured in order to monitor pleural fibrinolytic activity. The SCC was properly placed in all patients. UK administration was 366,000 i.u. and time the SCC were in place was 4.7 days. All PEs were initially drained completely. We examined the patients 30 days later, finding that PE had recurred in 2 (4%), resolution was complete and without sequelae in 8 (16%), nearly complete but with slight pleural thickening in 32 (64%) and partial with pleural opacities larger than 2 mm in 8 (16%). Use of SCC and UK (pleural fibrinolysis) is a moderately invasive procedure that is effective and well tolerated and that shortens drainage time, prevents sequelae and is relatively inexpensive for the treatment of PE with fibrin septation and/or multiloculation."

Our objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of complete lower limb US examining both the proximal and distal veins in this setting. In this prospective study, 210 consecutive patients were included. Complete US was performed by independent operators and compared blindly with a reference strategy combining clinical probability, ventilation perfusion scan and pulmonary angiography to a three-month clinical follow-up. Simultaneously, VIDAS D-dimer (DD) assay and helical computed tomography (HCT) of the lungs were assessed independently and blindly. PE was present in 74 patients (35%). Complete US detected DVT in 91 patients (43%), proximal in 51 and distal in 40. Sensitivity and specificity with a 0.95 confidence interval were respectively 0.93 [0.85 - 0.97] and 0.84 [0.77 - 0.89]. Limited US detected DVT in only 46 patients (22%). Sensitivity and specificity were respectively 0.55 [0.44 - 0.66] and 0.96 [0.92 - 0.98]. For DD they were 0.92 [0.83 - 0.96] and 0.24 [0.17 - 0.32] and for HCT 0.84 [0.73 - 0.90] and 0.87 [0.80 - 0.92]. Complete lower limb US has higher sensitivity and capacity to exclude PE than limited US, but a slightly lower specificity. Complete US results also compared favourably with those of HCT and DD. The utility of including this method in diagnostic strategies for PE needs to be assessed in cost-effectiveness analysis and in outcome studies."

CD010864,0,16898965,0,Expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 and 2 in acute myeloid leukemia: incidence and feasibility of immunohistochemical staining.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, are important therapeutic targets for various cancers including AML. Paraffin-embedded bone marrow samples (PE-BM) are, in most cases, the only tissue accessible to perform retrospective analyses of novel targets such as VEGF and/or its receptors. As a result, it limits our options to immunohistochemistry (IHS), or more expensive and less practical techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We analyzed the feasibility of IHS to measure VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 expression in 28 AML samples using monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) against Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR/Flk-1 (VEGFR-2). Medical records were reviewed for relevant clinical information. Expression of VEGFR-1 (+) and VEGFR-2 (+) were seen in 25% (7/28) and 43% (12/28) respectively. Forty-six percent (13/28) were dual-negatives for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2; 14% (4/28) were dual-positives for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. An inferior survival was observed in patients whose myeloblasts express either VEGFR-1 (+) or VEGFR-2 (+), or both. Determination of expression of VEGF receptors (1 and 2) by IHS in PE-BM tissue is feasible. Prospective comparison of IHC to flow cytometry or other molecular techniques, and assessment of the prognostic significance of VEGF receptors in AML patients is warranted."
CD010864,0,21074815,0,[Clinical use of D-dimer in patients with cancer].,"There is a well-known close relationship between cancer and the haemostatic system.

In the clinical practice, its main use is in the diagnostic algorithms of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and it is one of the diagnostic criteria of disseminated intravacular coagulation. In patients with cancer, the specificity of DD is lower than in the general population, reducing its usefulness. However, there is a growing evidence that points out a possible application of DD in the clinical management of cancer patients as a predictor of VTE, marker of hidden cancer in patients with idiopathic VTE, or even as an independent prognostic factor of response to chemotherapy and survival. In this review, the current evidence supporting the use of DD in cancer patients is critically exposed and discussed."

CD010864,0,17343127,0,[Clinical use of D-dimer testing].,"D-dimers are fibrin degradation products which are released during local or systemic activation of coagulation. D-dimer testing is widely used for the work-up of patients suspected of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Interpretation of D-dimer levels must take into account the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The specificity is usually low, and increased D-dimer levels are encountered in many non-thrombotic situations. The sensitivity varies among the different testing methods and is maximal with ELISA assays. Highly sensitive assays allow exclusion of venous thromboembolism when D-dimer levels are normal, without further imaging. However, this diagnostic strategy may only be used safely when the clinical probability of thromboembolism is low to moderate. When combined with other tests of coagulation, D-dimer testing is also useful in the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation."

Introduction of new diagnostic tools for the evaluation of the thromboresistance capacity of the body or for the measurement of molecular markers allows the testing of the body defenses against thrombosis which is becoming a routine clinical diagnosis. Antithrombin III (AT III), protein C, protein S, and parameters of fibrinolysis have been recognized to be very important anticoagulant proteins and regulators of thrombin formation and thrombus extension. Furthermore, a normal factor V is necessary for the normal function of the protein C pathway. The presence of a factor V mutation leads to the activated protein C resistance syndrome. However, the major incidence of thrombotic events concerns the overall population. It has been epidemiologically related to the existence of risk factors producing blood activation, which progressively saturates the body's thromboresistance. This period is clinically silent for a long time. The new molecular markers recently introduced can show the existence of a preclinical state of blood activation at the plasma level (fibrinopeptide A, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, modified antithrombin III, fragments 1 + 2 of prothrombin, D-dimer) or at the platelet level (B-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, and thrombospondin), and promising developments concern the endothelial level (soluble thrombomodulin). The most universally used blood activation test is the D-dimer assay. This analyte has become very popular in past years for its high sensitivity, its long half-life, and its easy detection directly on citrated plasma. Its negative predictive value (in deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) as well as its use for monitoring of thrombotic risk in the post-operative period have been well documented clinically. New investigations are initiated to find analytes reflecting endothelial damage, an early platelet activation, or the involvement of blood cells (mainly monocytes and neutrophils) in abnormal processes. It also becomes possible to evaluate directly pathological causes inducing blood activation, such as the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies or other autoimmune antibodies."

CD010864,0,22264587,0,Myeloperoxidase in the plasma and placenta of normal pregnant women and women with pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction.,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme protein produced and released by activated neutrophils and monocytes, and increased MPO is considered important in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Accumulating evidence suggests that preeclampsia (PE), idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and CVD share many similar metabolic disturbances, including an enhanced systemic inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that MPO plays an important role in the development of PE and IUGR. Plasma samples were collected mid-gestation and at delivery from women with normal pregnancies (nÂ =Â 40) and those who subsequently developed PE (nÂ =Â 20), IUGR (nÂ =Â 11) or both (PEÂ +Â IUGR, nÂ =Â 8). Placental samples were obtained immediately after delivery from 22 women with normal pregnancies, 19 women with PE, 14 women with IUGR, and 14 women with PEÂ +Â IUGR. The MPO concentrations were measured using ELISA. Women with PEÂ +Â IUGR had significantly higher plasma MPO before delivery than normal pregnant women. There was no difference in plasma levels at mid-gestation or the placental concentrations between women with normal pregnancies and those who developed PE, IUGR, or PEÂ +Â IUGR. Using explants prepared from the placentas of 8 women with normal pregnancies and 8 women with PE, we found no difference in the levels of MPO in the tissue homogenates and culture media between these two groups of women. Together, these results indicate that increased maternal circulating MPO in women with PEÂ +Â IUGR is likely a result of enhanced systemic inflammation caused by the established disease rather than a primary pathophysiological factor."

CD010864,0,10650235,0,New diagnostic tests for pulmonary embolism.,"In 1990, the multicenter Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED), sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, compared the diagnostic value of the radioisotopic ventilation-perfusion lung scan (V/Q scan) with that of pulmonary angiography for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Despite the endurance of the radioisotopic V/Q scan as the most widely used test for evaluation of pulmonary embolism (PE), a better screening tool is clearly needed for use in the emergency department. During the past decade, several new modalities have emerged for evaluation of patients with suspected PE. We evaluate the diagnostic utility of the D-dimer test and the alveolar dead space determination as potential screening tests and of spiral computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, transthoracic echocardiography, and transesophageal echocardiography as potential confirmatory tests for PE. For comparison, recent data on the diagnostic utility of the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and the V/Q scan are included. The potential application of these new tests to a hypothetical ED population is described."

The aim of our work was to determine the diagnostic potential and importance of D dimer in the early detection of deep vein thrombosis of lower extremities. Prospectively we have analyzed a group of 47 patients who were admitted to vascular department of Surgical Clinic in Nis during the period from 1.8.2001. to 31.3.2003. with echosonographically verified deep vein thrombosis of no more than 48 hours of duration. D dimer was measured before anticoagulant treatment started using commercial Nycomed test.

CD010864,0,8661955,0,Expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in vivo by human alveolar bone-derived polymorphonuclear leukocytes isolated from chronically inflamed sites of bone resorption.,"Alveolar bone-derived polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were characterized for their ability to produce inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and IL-6 in vivo. Periapical exudates (PE) were collected from periapical lesions with chronic periapical periodontitis through root canals. Cells and noncellular supernatants were then isolated by centrifugation. The concentration of cytokines present in the noncellular supernatants were determined by ELISA. High concentrations of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 were detected in PE, however, TNF alpha was not. PE contains predominantly PMNs ( > 95% of residing cells) with a few percent of lymphocytes and/or macrophages. These alveolar bone-derived PMNs were purified by the Ficoll-Hypaque gradient method and were analyzed for cytokine mRNA expression using the cytokine-specific reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Highly purified PMNs ( > 99.5%) isolated from PE expressed significant levels of mRNA for IL-alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha. IL-6 mRNA was not detected, although a high concentration of IL-6 was detected in supernatants of PE by ELISA. The IL-6 secretion in PE could be derived from macrophages, T lymphocytes, osteoblasts, or fibroblasts around periapical lesions. These data strongly suggest that human PMNs derived from alveolar bone can spontaneously produce IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha at sites of inflammation, and probably initiate inflammation and regulate augmentation of bone resorption in vivo."
CD010864,0,21922725,0,[The unresolved issue of false-positive D-dimer results in the diagnostic workup of pulmonary embolism].,"The unresolved issue of false-positive D-dimer results in the diagnostic workup of pulmonary embolism Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a difficult diagnosis as it lacks specific symptoms and clinical signs. After the determination of the pretest PE probability by a validated clinical score, D-dimers (DD) is the initial blood test in the majority of patients whose probability is low or intermediate. The low specificity of DD results in a high number of false-positives that then require thoracic angio-CT. A new clinical decision rule, called the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out criteria (PERC), identifies patients at such low risk that PE can be safely ruled-out without a DD test. Its safety has been confirmed in US emergency departments, but retrospective European studies showed that it would lead to 5-7% of undiagnosed PE. Alternative strategies are needed to reduce the proportion of false-positive DD results."

Therefore, rapid tests performed at the bedside (POCT or point of care testing) are attractive because they allow the emergency physician to obtain immediate biological, diagnostic and/or prognostic data. Userfriendly and with validated analytical performance, POCT have the potential to reduce laboratory time, patient length of stay and time to treatment or disposition. The expected benefit from POCT implementation will depend on the type of patients involved (inpatient or outpatient), their clinical condition and their overall care. Furthermore, logistical and economic implications should also be taken into account."
CD010864,0,18384840,0,Relationship between maternal and cord blood hemostatic disturbances in preeclamptic pregnancies.,"Endothelial cell activation or damage is believed to play a key role in preeclampsia (PE) and may underlie the hemostatic changes observed in this syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate a relationship between maternal and cord blood hemostatic disturbances in preeclamptic pregnancies. We measured the plasma levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen, both markers of hemostatic and endothelial function, and fibrin fragment D-dimer. Maternal blood from uncomplicated (n=42) and PEc pregnancies (n=44) were collected before delivery, and umbilical cord blood (UCB) immediately after delivery. In preeclamptic cases, UCB presented significantly higher tPA values and significantly lower PAI-1/tPA ratio. Preeclamptic women also presented significantly higher tPA, as well as PAI-1 values, when compared with normal pregnant women; no significant difference was found for D-dimer. In preeclamptic women, proteinuria (a marker of PE severity) correlated positively and significantly with tPA and PAI-1 antigen levels. An inverse relationship between maternal tPA antigen levels and fetal birth weigh in PE was also observed. Our data show that the hemostatic maternal disturbances observed in preeclamptic women have similarities with the UCB circulation, and that endothelial dysfunction is the most plausible underlying cause. Moreover, maternal hemostatic disturbances seem to be associated with the severity of PE. Further studies are needed to strength the values of tPA and PAI-1 as markers of severity in PE."
CD010864,0,18545830,0,Volumetric capnography as a noninvasive diagnostic procedure in acute pulmonary thromboembolism.,"Pulmonary thromboembolism is a common condition. Its diagnosis usually requires pulmonary scintigraphy, computed angiotomography, pulmonary arteriography and, in order to rule out other diagnoses, the measurement of D-dimer levels. Due to the fact that these diagnostic methods are not available in most Brazilian hospitals, the validation of other diagnostic techniques is of fundamental importance. We describe a case of a woman with chronic pulmonary hypertension who experienced a pulmonary thromboembolism event. Pulmonary scintigraphy, computed angiotomography and pulmonary arteriography were used in the diagnosis. The D-dimer test result was positive. Volumetric capnography was performed at admission and after treatment. The values obtained were compared with the imaging test results."

It has been reported that subclinical hyperthyroidism is not associated with coronary heart disease or mortality from cardiovascular causes but it is sufficient to induce arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. It has also been reported that increased factor X activity in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism represents a potential hypercoagulable state. Elevated D-dimer levels have been reported in acute pulmonary embolism and it has also been reported that right ventricular overload and hypoxia in acute pulmonary embolism may lead to right ventricular myocardium injury reflected by elevated cardiac troponin levels too. We present a case of recurrent pulmonary embolism associated with subclinical hyperthyroidism, in an 81-year-old Italian woman. Also this case focuses attention on the importance of a correct evaluation of subclinical hyperthyroidism."

This has led to the development of simple diagnostic tools in an attempt to reduce the number of invasive or costly exams needed to manage these patients. D-dimer (DD) measurement has proven to be a simple and very useful test to exclude PE and several strategies combining DD with clinical probability and other exams have been validated in large outcome studies. The problem faced by many physicians is the choice of the specific DD test and its more appropriate position in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of PE. This article focuses on these questions and also provides some limitations of DD use, such as its poor specificity in hospitalized and elderly patients."

CD010864,0,11819927,0,[Value of D-dimers in diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism].,"FIBRIN BREAKDOWN PRODUCTS: D-dimers are protein substances resulting from the action of 3 enzymes, thrombin, factor XIII and plasmin, on the fibrinogen molecules. In the case of thrombosis, all these enzymatic reactions are activated, explaining the increase in D-dimer levels induced. The notion of a threshold is only significant for a given test; the 500 micrograms/L threshold is widely used for tests relying on ELISA methods (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). FROM A TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW: The use of D-dimer ELISA in excluding pulmonary embolism is now well established. New quantitative tests with latex, based on a turbidimetric method, also appear interesting in this context. The latter is reliable, rapid, inexpensive, remarkably sensitive (97 to 100%) and widely available."

In 100 consecutive patients with suspected DVT, clinical probability was staged according to a pretest score proposed by Wells. For the determination of plasma D-dimer, heparin and citrate blood samples were drawn, and Cardiac D-dimer, STA-LIA, and Tina-quant tests were performed. Final diagnosis was confirmed either by duplex sonography or ascending venography. DVT was diagnosed in 37%, thrombophlebitis in 10%, and no venous thromboembolism was diagnosed in 52%. In 2% pulmonary embolism was detected and one patient was dismissed before final diagnosis. Cardiac D-dimer assay from citrate tubes showed a sensitivity of 88.6%, a specificity of 54%, a positive predictive value of 57.4%, and a negative predictive value of 87.1%. Nearly identical results were observed with heparin tubes. Corresponding results were 88.6%, 48%, 52.5%, and 85.7% for STA-LIA and 88.6%, 46%, 53.4%, and 85.2% for Tina-quant, respectively. In conclusion, we can say that Cardiac D-dimer is a rapid, whole blood assay with a great potential for clinical use. It can help in diagnosing DVT from citrate as well as heparin tubes with comparable sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values as STA-LIA and Tina-quant tests."
CD010864,0,7536683,0,Steel factor supports the cycling of isolated human CD34+ cells in the absence of other growth factors.,"Steel factor (SF) acts synergistically with other hematopoietic growth factors to support the proliferation of progenitor cells in a variety of culture systems. To determine whether SF alone could directly stimulate proliferation of early hematopoietic progenitor cells, isolated CD34+ cells from adult bone marrow and umbilical cord blood were studied in a short-term suspension culture in serum-free medium. Numbers of CD34+ and proliferating cells were quantified by flow cytometry; proliferation was assessed by simultaneous measurement of expression of the nuclear antigen Ki67 and DNA content (propidium iodide [PI]). In the absence of growth factors, the numbers of CD34+ and cycling cells declined over 2 days. Cells cultured in the presence of SF alone maintained the number of CD34+ and cycling cells at levels equal to the starting population. Withdrawal of growth factors led to a dramatic decrease in the number of cells in G1. Compared to cells grown in the absence of growth factors, cells grown in the presence of SF had significantly higher numbers of CD34+ and cycling cells (mean fold increase = 1.3 and 2; p < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). SF increased the numbers of cells in both G1 and later phases of the cell cycle. Addition of interleukin-3 (IL-3) to SF led to further significant increases in CD34+ and cycling cells. The effects of SF could not be attributed to inhibition of apoptosis. CD34+ cells isolated from peripheral blood (PB) from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) displayed similar characteristics. As assessed by binding of phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled ligand and flow cytometry, c-kit was expressed on 65 +/- 6% of isolated CD34+ cells and was detected on HLA-DRlow, CD38low, and Thy1+ subsets, as well as on more mature progenitor cells. Thus, while the effects of SF are most marked in combination with other growth factors, SF appears to bind to and directly maintain the active cell-cycle characteristics of isolated CD34+ cells."

Intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation with B. rodhaini resulted in acute death in euthymic (nu/+) and athymic (nu/nu) BALB/c mice. Treatment with DD at an early stage of infection saved both mice from acute death. Parasitemia recurred in some of them but resulted in death only in nu/nu mice. A re-challenge with 10(5) parasitized erythrocytes (PE) on the surviving mice on day 28 post infection revealed resistance in nu/+ but not in nu/nu mice. The results suggested a participation of the thymus in the protective mechanisms. Immunological changes were then observed on nu/+ and nu/nu mice which were inoculated ip with 10(4)PE and treated with the drug, and then challenged with 10(5)PE ip on day 28. An antibody response was measured with immediate reaction by footpad injection of a soluble antigen of B. rodhaini and by ELISA of serum antibody using the antigen and protein A, on day 10 and later, and further a pronounced response was detected after re-challenge in nu/+ mice. No response was detected by ELISA in nu/nu mice. Delayed footpad reaction was seen in nu/+ mice by day 14 and later but it was suppressed after the re-challenge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The aim of this prospective randomised study was to compare the efficacy of these different techniques with regard to treatment of patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPG) having at least 50% crescents. Forty-four patients with a RPG were included for treatment either by IA or PE (with albumin as substitution for removed plasma). All patients were additionally treated with immunosuppression. A median of 6 sessions of PEs were performed in 23 patients compared with 6 IAs in 21 patients. Goodpasture's syndrome (GP) was present in 6 patients (PE 3, IA 3). All of them started and ended in dialysis, two died. Among the remaining 38 patients (26 men, 12 women) 87% had antibodies to ANCA. Creatinine clearance for PE versus IA were at a median at start 17.1 and 19.8 ml/min, and at 6 months 49 and 49 ml/min, respectively. At 6 months 7 of 10 patients did not need dialysis (remaining: IA 0/5 and PE 2/5, n.s.). The extent of improvement did not differ between the groups. Three patients died during the observation period of 6 months (IA 2; PE 1, on HD). Although no difference was found between the IA or the PE group this study shows that the protocol used was associated with an improved renal function in most patients (except for Goodpasture's syndrome) whereas 70% of them could leave the dialysis program."
CD010864,0,1115842,0,Mechanisms for elevated fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products in acute experimental pulmonary embolism.,"The mechanism and significance of elevated levels of serum fibrin degradation products (FDP) in pulmonary embolism were investigated experimentally. Dogs were embolized with autologous blood clot-incorporating canine 125I-fibrin and were infused with either saline, heparin, or streptokinase. Serial measurements were made of total FDP by hemagglutination inhibition assay and of radioactive FDP. After saline, the peak level of total FDP was 323 mug/ml, but radioactive FDP was only 8 mug/ml. After heparin, these values were 44 and 11 mug/ml, respectively, and after streptokinase, 415 and 20 mug/ml. The results suggest that under these experimental conditions the elevated levels of FDP in pulmonary embolism are derived mainly from lysis of fibrin deposited after embolization rather than from lysis of the original embolus. Heparin inhibits both fibrin deposition and elevation of FDP levels after embolism."

Both the activity of PEG-PE in prolonging the circulation time of liposomes and the relative steric barrier activity of amphipathic polymer, measured by a liposome agglutination assay, were found to be directly proportional to the chain length of PEG-PE (PEG5000-PE greater than PEG2000-PE greater than PEG750-PE). However, PEG5000-PE caused a reduced target binding of immunoliposomes in mice due to its overly strong steric barrier activity. The best PEG-PE species supporting the target binding of immunoliposomes was PEG2000-PE, the activity of which was compatible to that of ganglioside GM1. However, GM1 only showed a weak steric barrier activity, suggesting a different mechanism for this glycolipid."

PCR and sequence analysis revealed that 16 copies of AAKPV(E) in tandem repeat region 1 (RR1) of M. hyopneumoniae 97kDa adhesion were successfully fused to the downstream of PE(DeltaIII) to create a subunit vaccine, i.e. PE(DeltaIII)-RR1. This chimeric protein, over-expressed in inclusion bodies of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, was characterized by a monoclonal antibody (MAb) F2G5 prepared against RR1 of the 97kDa adhesin and was readily purified. The data indicated that the epitope recognized by MAb F2G5 was located in the structure of PE(DeltaIII)-RR1. Using ELISA and Western blot analyses, the specific IgG immune response against RR1 and whole adhesin in mice immunized with PE(DeltaIII)-RR1 was found more marked than that in mice immunized with the M. hyopneumoniae whole cells. Similarly, PE(DeltaIII)-RR1 also stimulated a remarkable IgG response against RR1 in pigs compared to that in pigs immunized with the conventional M. hyopneumoniae vaccine. The PE(DeltaIII)-RR1 would be potentially useful for the future development of a M. hyopneumoniae adhesin vaccine."

We investigated whether aPL antibodies could be detected in the serum as well as BALF of patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS. IgG anticardiolipin, IgG anti-beta2-glycoprotein I, IgG antiphosphatidic acid and IgG antiphosphatidylserine antibodies were detected by ELISA in low titers within the normal range in the BALF and serum of nine patients with ALI and 17 patients with ARDS. However, one out of 27 patients investigated had high levels of aPL antibodies in both BALF and serum. This patient suffered from severe ARDS due to sepsis. The high aPL antibody levels in serum possibly triggered by sepsis were associated with high aPL antibody levels in BALF, which can be explained by high capillary-alveolar permeability.

Pooled mouse sera were analyzed by ELISA at various times after immunization for IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. In naive mice, vaccine alone induced low levels of IL-3 and IL-5 only; vaccine plus alum induced a low IL-6 response as well. The MF59-based adjuvants significantly increased the IL-5 and IL-6 levels, whereas Quil A LTC induced strong IFN-gamma and measurable IL-2 responses, in addition to moderate IL-5 and IL-6. In previously infected mice, MF59 and MF59/MTP-PE were capable of generating IFN-gamma responses, as well as IL-5 and IL-6. All of the cytokine responses were rapid (peaking 3 to 12 h postimmunization) and short lived. In naive mice, the MF59 adjuvants induced serum cytokine profiles that are consistent with a primarily Th2-type response, whereas the Quil A LTC induced cytokines associated with both Th1 and Th2 responses. Ab analyses indicated that, although the adjuvants strongly affected the magnitude of the humoral response, there was no obvious correlation between the cytokine profile observed and the subclasses of Ab induced."

CD010864,0,22535745,0,Apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide inhibits atherosclerosis by altering plasma metabolites in hypercholesterolemia.,"An apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide, D-4F, has been shown to improve vasodilation and inhibit atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic low-density lipoprotein receptor-null (LDLr(-/-)) mice. To study the metabolic variations of D-4F ininhibiting atherosclerosis, metabonomics, a novel system biological strategy to investigate the pathogenesis, was developed. Female LDLr(-/-) mice were fed a Western diet and injected with or without D-4F intraperitoneally. Atherosclerotic lesion formation was measured, whereas plasma metabolic profiling was obtained on the basis of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography in tandem with time-of-flight mass spectrometry operating in both positive and negative ion modes. Data were processed by multivariate statistical analysis to graphically demonstrate metabolic changes. The partial least-squares discriminate analysis model was validated with cross-validation and permutation tests to ensure the model's reliability. D-4F significantly inhibited the formation of atherosclerosis in a time-dependent manner. The metabolic profiling was altered dramatically in hypercholesterolemic LDLr(-/-) mice, and a significant metabolic profiling change in response to D-4F treatment was observed in both positive and negative ion modes. Thirty-six significantly changed metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers. A series of phospholipid metabolites, including lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), and diacylglycerol (DG), particularly the long-chain LysoPC, was elevated dramatically in hypercholesterolemic LDLr(-/-) mice but reduced by D-4F in a time-dependent manner. Quantitative analysis of LysoPC, LysoPE, PC, and DG using HPLC was chosen to validate the variation of these potential biomarkers, and the results were consistent with the metabonomics findings. Our findings demonstrated that D-4F may inhibit atherosclerosis by regulating phospholipid metabolites specifically by decreasing plasma long-chain LysoPC."
CD010864,0,12393696,0,Antihirudin antibodies following low-dose subcutaneous treatment with desirudin for thrombosis prophylaxis after hip-replacement surgery: incidence and clinical relevance.,"Recombinant hirudin has been found to be immunogenic in patients treated with lepirudin following heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). We assessed the incidence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antihirudin antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 112 patients enrolled in a dose-finding study with desirudin. Patients received desirudin subcutaneously following orthopedic hip surgery at 10 mg twice a day (n = 17), 15 mg twice a day (n = 75), and 20 mg twice a day (n = 20). Of 112 patients, 11 (9.8%) developed antihirudin antibodies independently of the dose. The rate of immunization did not differ from that observed in HIT patients treated with lepirudin (P =.113). Plasma concentrations of desirudin did not differ between antihirudin antibody-positive and -negative patients. Antihirudin antibodies had no impact on incidences of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, allergic reactions, and hemorrhage. However, the total number of immunized patients observed was low and so infrequent (but severe) effects of antihirudin antibodies cannot be excluded."
CD010864,0,21211759,0,"ACR Appropriateness CriteriaÂ® on chest pain, suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.","Acute chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome is a frequent complaint in the emergency department. Acute coronary syndromes include myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Being able to establish the diagnosis rapidly and accurately may be lifesaving. A cardiac workup is indicated in this subset of patients in the acute setting, even if there are no ischemic changes on electrocardiography. If the clinical examination and initial cardiac workup suggest that a patient is having myocardial ischemia, the patient will usually be urgently referred for invasive coronary angiography and revascularization. In stable patients without evidence of ST elevation and ongoing myocardial ischemia, an initially conservative approach is sometimes considered. Cardiac risk stratification of this subgroup of patients who are at low and intermediate risk for coronary artery disease is recommended before discharge, and imaging is necessary to exclude ischemia as an etiology. Noninvasive cardiac imaging modalities include chest radiography, single photon-emission CT myocardial perfusion imaging, echocardiography, multidetector CT, PET, and MRI. Noncardiac etiologies of chest pain include aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm, pulmonary embolism, pericardial disease, and lung parenchymal disease. Noninvasive cardiac imaging in patients who are at low and intermediate risk for coronary artery disease may improve confidence regarding the safety of discharge from the emergency department. In addition to risk stratification, noncoronary etiologies for chest pain can be established with imaging."
CD010864,0,9556229,0,Clinical evaluation of an immunoturbidimetric D-dimer assay in the diagnostic procedure of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.,"We investigated 128 patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis and 26 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Plasma cross-linked fibrin degradation products were measured instantly by a new rapid and fully quantitative immunoturbidimetric assay (Boehringer Mannheim) which recognizes the D-dimer epitope by antibody-coated latex particles. Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was established by either ascending venography (n = 105) or colour duplex ultrasound (n = 8), whereas for the exclusion of deep vein thrombosis only venography was accepted. The sensitivity/specificity for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was 98%/44%. Patients with suspected pulmonary embolism were examined by pulmonary angiography (n = 19) or perfusion lung scanning alone (n = 6), if sufficient. One pulmonary embolism was diagnosed at post-mortem examination. For pulmonary embolism, sensitivity/specificity was 100%/50%. These findings indicate that the new immunoturbidimetric technique is as reliable as former ELISA methods and allows to rule out thromboembolic disorders. D-dimers showed a correlation to the extent of the deep vein thrombosis, proximal thrombosis producing higher D-dimer levels. Patients presenting immediately after the onset of symptoms were found to have higher D-dimers than patients examined after a few days. A quantitative D-dimer measurement thus seems to provide precious additional information of the duration and the extent of thromboembolic disease."
CD010864,0,23044500,0,Accuracy of D-dimer:fibrinogen ratio to diagnose pulmonary thromboembolism in patients admitted to intensive care units.,"Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) may increase D-dimer and decrease fibrinogen levels. However, in settings such as intensive care units (ICU) and in long-term hospitalised patients, several factors may influence D-dimer and fibrinogen concentrations and make them unreliable indicators for the diagnosis of PTE. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of D-dimer:fibrinogen ratio (DDFR) for the diagnosis of PTE in ICU patients."
CD010864,0,9279229,1,D-dimer testing for suspected pulmonary embolism in outpatients.,"The plasma level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product (FDP), is nearly always increased in the presence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Hence, a normal D-dimer level (below a cutoff value of 500 micrograms/L by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) may allow the exclusion of PE. To assess the negative predictive value of a D-dimer concentration below 500 micrograms/L in outpatients with suspected PE, and the safety of withholding anticoagulant treatment from such patients, we performed D-dimer assays, lower limb venous compression ultrasonography, and lung scans in 671 consecutive outpatients presenting in the Emergency Center of the Geneva University Hospital with suspected PE. Pulmonary angiography was reserved for patients with an inconclusive noninvasive workup. Patients with a normal D-dimer concentration were discharged without anticoagulant treatment and followed for 3 mo. The prevalence of PE was 29%, and D-dimer (using a cutoff of 500 micrograms/L) had a diagnostic sensitivity for PE of 99.5%. Overall diagnostic specificity of D-dimer was 41%, but it was lower among older patients. Of the 198 patients with a D-dimer concentration below the cutoff value, 196 were free of PE, one had a PE, and one had incomplete information because of loss to follow-up. Thus, the negative predictive value of D-dimer concentration fell between 197 of 198 and 196 of 198 cases of PE (99% [95% CI: 96.4 to 99.9]). Using a cutoff value of 4,000 micrograms/L, the overall specificity of D-dimer concentration for PE was 93.1%. In conclusion, a plasma D-dimer concentration below 500 micrograms/L allows the exclusion of PE in 29% of outpatients suspected of having PE. Withholding anticoagulation from such patients is associated with a conservative 1% risk of thromboembolic events during follow-up."

CD010864,0,9136593,0,[Study of hemostatic molecular marker].,"We examined hemostatic molecular markers in various thrombotic disorders. The efficacy of treatment in relation to the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score when the treatment was begun showed that greater efficacy was achieved in Pre-DIC than in DIC patients. The outcome was poorer with increasing DIC score, suggesting that early treatment is important. The sensitivity in some of molecular markers was high for both DIC and Pre-DIC. Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggest that soluble fibrin monomer level could be the most useful marker for the diagnosis of DIC. In examination of these markers in deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, and cerebral infarction, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex were useful marker for the diagnosis. Increased plasma GMP-140 was suggested to be the activation of platelets. The patients with high levels of plasma thrombomodulin (TM) considered to be a marker of vascular endothelial injuries became poor outcome. We will term these patients with high TM as systemic vascular endothelium injuries syndrome, and treat those by protecting the vascular endothelium."
CD010864,0,18690588,0,Venous thromboembolism: contemporary diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.,"To discuss new features that were published during the past few years on diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Progress has been made in assessing clinical probability of pulmonary embolism (PE), in addressing the particular aspects of PE diagnosis in the elderly, in evaluating the diagnostic performance of single- and multi-detector row helical computed tomography (hCT), and in looking at the role of D-dimer measurement and lower limb venous compression ultrasonography in the diagnostic work-up of PE. New therapeutic options have also been proposed. Diagnosing VTE depends upon several, mainly non-invasive diagnostic tools that must be used sequentially, depending on the clinical situation and the local expertise. In the vast majority of patients, a noninvasive work-up is feasible and the diagnostic algorithms are becoming simpler. We focused on new developments of clinical probability assessment, PE in the elderly, potential new uses of D-dimer measurement, advent of multidetector row helical computed tomography and utility of ultrasonography to detect deep vein thrombosis in PE suspected patients. Treatment of acute venous thromboembolism consists of parenteral administration of heparin (usually low-molecular-weight heparin or, more recently, fondaparinux) overlapped and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists that will be administered for a certain period of time (usually 3 to 12 months), depending upon the estimated risks of recurrence and bleeding in each individual patient. Contemporary features include the controversial possibility of reducing the intensity of oral anticoagulant treatment (INR 1.5-2) after an initial full-intensity treatment (INR 2-3) period of 3 to 12 months, and the emergence of new anticoagulant drugs such as direct oral synthetic inhibitors of thrombin or factor Xa."

Clinical outcome studies demonstrated that PE can be safely ruled out in patients with unlikely clinical probability in combination with a normal D-dimer test result; in all other patients additional imaging is needed. The aim is to accurately confirm or rule out the diagnosis of PE, after which, if indicated, anticoagulant treatment can be initiated. Various diagnostic tests are available, and this article reviews the different imaging techniques in patients with suspected PE. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the imaging test of choice because of its high sensitivity and specificity. Compression ultrasonography and ventilation perfusion scintigraphy are reserved for patients with concomitant suspicion of deep vein thrombosis or contraindication for CTPA. Furthermore the diagnostic process in patients with clinically suspected recurrent PE, PE during pregnancy, and PE in the elderly and in patients with malignancy are discussed."

CD010864,0,21778141,0,Fibroblast growth factor 2 promotes primitive endoderm development in bovine blastocyst outgrowths.,"Primitive endoderm (PE) is the second extraembryonic tissue to form during embryogenesis in mammals. The PE develops from pluripotent cells of the blastocyst inner cell mass. Experimental results described herein provide evidence that FGF2 stimulates PE development during bovine blastocyst development in vitro. Bovine blastocysts were cultured individually on a feeder layer-free, Matrigel-coated surface in the presence or absence of FGF2. A majority of blastocysts cultures formed outgrowths (76.8%) and the rate of outgrowth formation was not affected by FGF2 supplementation. However, supplementation with FGF2 increased the incidence of PE outgrowths on Days 13 and 15 after in vitro fertilization. Presumptive PE cultures contained cells with a phenotype distinct from trophectoderm (TE). Cell identity was validated by expression of GATA4 and GATA6 mRNA and transferrin protein, all markers of the PE lineage. Expression of GATA4 occurred coincident with blastocyst expansion and hatching. These cells did not express IFNT and CDX2 (TE lineage markers). Profiles of FGF receptor (FGFR) isoforms were distinct between PE and TE cultures. Specifically, FGFR1b and FGFR1c were the predominant FGFR transcripts in PE whereas FGFR2b transcripts were abundant in TE. Supplementation with FGF2 increased the mitotic index of PE but not TE. Moreover, FGF signaling appears important for initiation of PE formation in blastocysts, presumably by lineage committal from NANOG-positive epiblast cells, because chemical disruption of FGFR kinase activity with PD173074 reduces GATA4 expression and increases NANOG expression. Collectively, these results indicate that FGF2 and potentially other FGFs specify PE formation and mediate PE proliferation during early pregnancy in cattle."
CD010864,0,16459532,0,Cancer related thrombophilia: clinical importance and management strategies.,"Acquired thrombophilic state associated with a significant risk of thrombosis is frequently encountered in malignancy. Venous and arterial thromboembolism is a common complication and patients with cancer, also present with a hypercoagulable state, even in the absence of thrombosis. Furthermore, clotting activation may play a role in tumor progression. The pathogenesis of thrombosis in cancer is multifactorial; however, a relevant role is attributed to the tumor cell capacity to interact with and activate the host hemostatic system. Among other factors, the prothrombotic action of antitumor therapies is also important. Thrombotic events can influence the morbidity and mortality of the underlying disease. Therefore, preventing these complications in cancer patients is a clinically relevant issue. Recently, new approaches to the prevention and cure of thrombosis in cancer have been investigated, and the hypothesis that the strategies to inhibit clotting mechanism may favorably affect malignant disease is gaining increasing interest. In this article the various aspects of the complex relationship between thrombosis and cancer, from pathophysiology to therapy, are reviewed."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate biomarkers of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) in order to predict a complicated clinical course and long-term respiratory complications in acute PE.We retrospectively enrolled 50 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute PE. Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin-I, fibrin degradation products, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and arterial pH were measured to assess their prognostic significance. RVD was evaluated by echocardiography at admission, the clinical course during hospitalization was monitored for the development of complications (death, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation or circulatory shock), and the need for home oxygen therapy (HOT) was assessed at/after discharge.Thirty-two patients (64%) had RVD at admission, 6 (12%) developed a complicated clinical course, and 7 (14%) required HOT. Plasma BNP was significantly higher in patients with RVD (median value, 319.3 versus 50.5 pg/mL, P = 0.001). Plasma BNP was also significantly higher (median value, 1307.9 versus 102.6 pg/mL, P = 0.02) and arterial pH significantly lower (acidic) (median value, 7.371 versus 7.438, P = 0.008) in patients who developed a complicated clinical course. In addition, plasma BNP was also significantly higher in patients who required HOT (median value, 505.1 versus 91.1 pg/mL, P = 0.02). Plasma BNP at admission is not only a reliable marker of RVD and predictor of short-term prognosis, but also a predictor of long-term respiratory prognosis in acute PE patients."

HIT is caused by antibodies to the heparin/platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex. Management of HIT involves discontinuation of heparin and anticoagulation with a nonheparin alternative such as a direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI). This poses a challenge in the management of patients who need to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (CPB), because CPB requires anticoagulation with heparin and standardized protocols for use of DTIs are not widely available. We report two patients with HIT who underwent successful CPB with heparin anticoagulation following plasma exchange (PE) to reduce heparin/PF4 antibody titers. Case 1 is a 46-year-old male with cardiac amyloidosis who needed urgent placement of a left ventricular assist device. Case 2 is a 34-year-old woman with acute myocarditis who needed placement of a biventricular assist device. Both patients had positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays for heparin/PF4 antibodies and clinical evidence of HIT before PE. Following PE and subsequent CPB, neither patient had clinical or laboratory evidence of HIT. The literature regarding the use of PE for the treatment of complications of HIT and as prophylaxis before CPB is reviewed."

In the present study, respiratory muscle function was assessed in 31 patients with PH (20 females and 11 males; mean pulmonary artery pressure, 51+/-20 mmHg; median World Health Organization class 3.0+/-0.5; 25 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and six patients with chronic thromboembolic PH) and in 31 control subjects (20 females and 11 males) well-matched for gender, age and BMI (body mass index). A 6-min walking test was performed to determine exercise capacity. Volitionally assessed maximal inspiratory (7.5+/-2.1 compared with 6.2+/-2.8 kPa; P=0.04) and expiratory (13.3+/-4.2 compared with 9.9+/-3.4 kPa; P<0.001) mouth pressures, sniff nasal (8.3+/-1.9 compared with 6.6+/-2.2 kPa; P=0.002) and transdiaphragmatic (11.3+/-2.5 compared with 8.7+/-2.5 kPa; P<0.001) pressures, non-volitionally assessed twitch mouth (1.46+/-0.43 compared with 0.97+/-0.41 kPa; P<0.001) and transdiaphragmatic (2.08+/-0.55 compared with 1.47+/-0.72 kPa; P=0.001) pressures during bilateral anterior magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation were markedly lower in patients with PH compared with control subjects. Maximal inspiratory mouth (r=0.58, P<0.001) and sniff transdiaphragmatic (r=0.43, P=0.02) pressures were correlated with the 6-min walking distance in patients with PH. In conclusion, the present study provides strong evidence that respiratory muscle strength is reduced in patients with PH compared with well-matched control subjects. Furthermore, the 6-min walking distance is significantly linked to parameters assessing inspiratory muscle strength."

The study was a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 262 consecutive patients, 94 patients presenting with suspected deep venous thrombosis and 168 with suspected pulmonary embolism. Fifty-nine patients (22.5%) were classified as venous thromboembolism-positive, 27 with pulmonary embolism, and 32 with deep venous thrombosis. One hundred and fourteen patients (43.5%) had SimpliRED D-dimer and a soluble fibrin result of less than or equal to 2.0 microg/ml; the negative predictive value was 98.2% (95% confidence interval: 93.8-99.8%), and the likelihood ratio was 0.06. Eight patients with proven venous thromboembolism had a negative SimpliRED D-dimer; all had elevated ELISA D-dimer levels and six had elevated soluble fibrin levels. This suggests that patients with venous thromboembolism and a normal SimpliRED result do not have impaired fibrinolysis as a cause of their false-negative result. This study suggests that the combination of SimpliRED and soluble fibrin can be used to exclude venous thromboembolism in over 40% of patients who present with a clinical suspicion of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and that the small group of patients with venous thromboembolism and a normal SimpliRED do not have impaired fibrinolysis."

CD010864,0,20304486,0,"Expression of AT1R, AT2R and AT4R and their roles in extravillous trophoblast invasion in the human.","The placental renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is active from early pregnancy and may have a role in placentation. Angiotensin II (AngII) acts via binding to receptor types AT1R and AT2R. Recently smaller peptide members of the angiotensin family have been recognised as having biological relevance. Angiotensin (3-8) (AngIV) has a specific receptor (AT4R) and evokes hypertrophy, vasodilatation and vascular inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to characterise placental expression of AT1R, AT2R and AT4R, and to determine whether AngII and AngIV regulate extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion, apoptosis and proliferation. Placental samples were obtained from women undergoing elective surgical termination of pregnancy (TOP) at 8-10 weeks gestation (early TOP), 12-14 weeks gestation (mid TOP) or at delivery following normal pregnancy or with pre-eclampsia (PE). Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR were performed to determine placental mRNA and protein expression of AT1R, AT2R and AT4R at all gestational ages. EVT invasion following culture with AngII or AngIV was assessed in early placental tissue using Matrigel invasion assays. Invasion was assessed on day 6 of culture and placental explants were harvested for immunohistochemical analysis of apoptosis and proliferation. The results from qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry showed placental AT1R expression which did not vary with gestation. The highest levels of expression of AT2R were found in early and mid TOP placentae compared to term pregnancy. Expression of AT4R was increased in term placentae, with a significant reduction in PE placentae. Moreover, culture with AngIV or AngII increased EVT invasion from placental explants, which showed increased trophoblast proliferation and reduced apoptosis. This study has characterised expression of AT4R and AT1R and AT2R in human placenta throughout normal pregnancy and in PE. Both AngIV and AngII may play an important role in normal pregnancy."

The nature of the infection was confirmed by serology using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and virus isolation in primary cultures of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM). Farm production recovered after eight weeks of losses. In order to evaluate the persistence of infection in the herd, five SPF-piglets were introduced in two different sections of the PRRS-affected barn four months after the disappearance of clinical symptoms, and two others were placed in a neighboring building with apparently healthy farrow-to-finnish pigs. Clinical signs, body temperature, humoral immune response, virological and histopathological findings were recorded over a 42-day period. Clinical signs were evident in all of the sentinels and prolonged fever (> or = 40 degrees C) was recorded one day post-exposure (PE). Antibody titers to PRRS virus could be detected by IIF on PAM seven days PE, and reached 1:1024 by day 21 PE. Three of the sentinels developed significant virus neutralizing antibody titers (> 1:8 to < or = 1:128) by day 35 PE. In all cases, the virus could be isolated from the serum between day 7 and 42 PE. Thus, the virus and specific antibodies coexisted for several weeks. Lesions of interstitial pneumonia was demonstrated in few animals. In experimental inoculation studies, the viral strain isolated from the sentinel pigs produced severe reproductive disorders in two sows inoculated at 95 days of gestation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Mean PTX3 levels were significantly higher in women who subsequently developed PE (7.31 ng/ml, SD = 4.12) when compared to those with normal pregnancy outcome (4.92 ng/ml, SD = 1.94, p=0.0046). There were no significant differences between PTX3 levels in women with FGR (4.82 ng/ml, SD = 2.35) compared to normal pregnancy outcome (p=0.88). The median CRP levels did not vary significantly between the three groups (p=0.26).

CD010864,0,10849942,0,Serum levels of progesterone in patients with preeclampsia.,In a matched pair-study study we investigated the hitherto controversially discussed serum levels of progesterone in 40 women with severe preeclampsia (PE) and 40 normotensive controls. Serum levels were determined by applying a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Median serum levels of progesterone in preeclamptic women and in controls were not statistically significant (P = 0.73). Our study indicates that the absence of altered serum levels of progesterone may not reflect the potential role of this hormone in preeclampsia.
CD010864,0,19436653,0,Alveolar dead space and capnographic variables before and after thrombolysis in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common condition. The central aim of this study was to describe the use of volumetric capnography (VCap) before and after fibrinolytic treatment of major PE. Lung scintigraphy was used as a base of comparison for the results of this treatment. We describe the cases of two conscious and spontaneously breathing patients (20- and by 24-year-old women) with major PE undergoing thrombolysis. Curves of CO(2) were obtained VCap and associated with arterial blood gas analysis and D-dimer. The pattern of VCap was compared with the VCap of health volunteers. Parameters also calculated were: P(a-et)CO(2) gradient, alveolar dead space fraction (AVDSf ), late dead space fraction (fDlate), and slope phase III (Slp III). The VCap results before and after thrombolysis for patients 1 and 2 were, respectively, P(a-et)CO(2): 12.6 to 5.8 and 7.9 to 1.6 (mmHg); AVDSf: 0.46 to 0.18 and 0.25 to 0.05; fDlate: 0.46 to 0.21 and 0.24 to 0.04; Slp III: 1.75 to 5.10 and 1.21 to 5.61 (mmHg/L). Lung scintigraphy was used to compare VCap results from the two subjects with VCap results from healthy volunteers and pigs before and after treatment associated with arterial blood gas, D-dimer, and showed satisfactory agreement."

CD010864,0,19533432,0,[Clinical and radiological findings in patients diagnosed pulmonary thromboembolism by pulmonary computerized tomography angiography].,"Pulmonary computed tomography angiography (PCTA) is the initial imaging test for the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). In the study, it was aimed to determine the clinical, radiological findings in patients diagnosed PTE by PCTA, to investigate the relationship between the thrombus localisation and the clinical, laboratory parameters. 172 patients diagnosed PTE by PCTA between 2004 and 2007 were included in the study. The clinical, laboratory parameters, thrombus localisation were evaluated. Mean age (female/male: 99/73) was 58.27 +/- 15.11, mean Wells score was 2.99 +/- 2.40. 39.5% (n= 68) of patients had low risk, 50.6% (n= 87) intermediate, 9.9% (n= 17) high risk. The most common comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases (n= 46, 26.7%), COPD (n= 26,15%). Recent operation history (n= 47, 27.3%), immobilisation (n= 37, 21.5%) were the most frequent risk factors. Dyspnea (89%), chest pain (59.9%) were the most common complaints. Deep venous thrombosis was detected by Doppler USG in 56.4% of patients. The most common site of thrombus was the right lower lobe artery (44.2%). In 30% of patients, the most proximal level of thrombus was the main pulmonary arteries (MPA). Mean age of patients with MPA thrombus (61.96 +/- 14.47), was higher than patients with distal thrombus (56.62 +/- 15.16, p= 0.03). Patients with the recent operation history (41% vs. 21%, p= 0.009), cancer (24% vs. 2.5%, p< 0.001) had higher rates of MPA thrombus. In patients presented with syncope,16.9% of them had a MPA thrombus compared to others having 3.3% rate of other thrombus localisations (p= 0.004). Mean Wells score in patients with MPA thrombus was higher compared to others (3.59 +/- 2.38/2.72 +/- 2.37, p= 0.02), however it didn't differ the extent of proximal thrombus between low, intermediate and high risk patients. The mean level of D-dimer was not different between patients with MPA thrombus and the others. D-dimer level was significantly higher in patients with thrombus localized at truncus pulmonalis (1357 microg/mL vs. 724 microg/mL). There was no significant difference between Doppler USG positive and negative patients for DVT. In conclusion, it was determined that the thrombus was at MPA in one third of the patients, a significant relationship between the presence of the recent operation, cancer history and syncope with MPA thrombus. In patients with a thrombus at truncus pulmonalis, D-dimer levels were higher."

CD010864,0,7991583,0,Rapid humanization of the Fv of monoclonal antibody B3 by using framework exchange of the recombinant immunotoxin B3(Fv)-PE38.,"B3(Fv)-PE38 is a recombinant single-chain immunotoxin in which the Fv region of carcinoma-specific antibody B3 is fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). The efficacy of monoclonal antibody B3 and B3 immunotoxins in cancer therapy and diagnosis may be limited by the human anti-mouse response. Here we describe the humanization of the Fv of B3(Fv)-PE38 by ""framework exchange."" The variable domains of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains were aligned with their best human homologs to identify framework residues that differ. Initially, 11 framework residues in VH and six in VL were changed by site-specific mutagenesis to human residues and introduced simultaneously into a preassembled single-chain Fv expression cassette. Six VH and five VL residues that differ were not changed because they were buried, in the interdomain interface, or previously found to result in decreased affinity when mutated. This basic design resulted in some 20-fold loss of activity. Changing VL residues at the interdomain interfacial position 100 and at the buried position 104 to the human sequence increased the activity 8-fold. Changing VH residue at position 82b from the human sequence back to that of the mouse restored the activity 2- to 3-fold to the full binding and cytotoxic activity of the mouse sequence. Humanized B3(Fv)-PE38 lost immunogenic epitopes recognized by sera from monkeys that had been immunized with B3(Fv)-PE38."

We investigated the sensitivity to APC in 180 Japanese controls and in 96 Japanese patients with venous and arterial thrombosis (28 with deep vein thrombosis; 13 with pulmonary thromboembolism; 41 with cerebral infarction; and 14 with coronary artery disease). All of the patient groups showed significantly reduced sensitivity to APC, reflected by the lower normalized APC-sensitivity ratio (n-APC-SR), as compared with healthy control. The APC-sensitivity ratio was negatively correlated with plasma activated factor VII levels. These results suggest that the low n-APC-SR is related to venous or arterial thrombotic disease. The APC resistance may serve as a potential marker for assessing the hypercoagulable state."
CD010864,0,19926740,0,Venous thromboemboli and exacerbations of COPD.,"The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD patients hospitalised with an exacerbation were included consecutively. Symptoms, signs and clinical, haematological and epidemiological parameters on admission were noted. All patients underwent computed tomographic angiography and ultrasonographic examination for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE). Wells and Geneva scores were calculated. Patients were followed-up for 1 yr in order to determine mortality. Deep vein thrombosis and PE were detected in 14 and 18 patients, respectively. The prevalence of VTE was three times higher in patients with an exacerbation of unknown origin than in patients with an exacerbation of known origin (p = 0.016). Of patients with VTE, 20 (95%) had high D-dimer levels. The negative predictive value of D-dimer testing was 0.98. Although the moderate- and high-risk categories of both the Wells and Geneva methods covered all PE patients, the Wells method identified 49% less potential patients for PE investigation. Mortality at 1 yr was higher (61.9% versus 31.8%) in VTE patients (p = 0.013). VTE is a common problem in COPD patients hospitalised with an exacerbation, leading to high long-term mortality. D-dimer levels and the Wells criteria can be used to determine whether or not these patients are assessed for a thromboembolic event."
CD010864,0,20711519,0,A comparative analysis of extra-embryonic endoderm cell lines.,"Prior to gastrulation in the mouse, all endodermal cells arise from the primitive endoderm of the blastocyst stage embryo. Primitive endoderm and its derivatives are generally referred to as extra-embryonic endoderm (ExEn) because the majority of these cells contribute to extra-embryonic lineages encompassing the visceral endoderm (VE) and the parietal endoderm (PE). During gastrulation, the definitive endoderm (DE) forms by ingression of cells from the epiblast. The DE comprises most of the cells of the gut and its accessory organs. Despite their different origins and fates, there is a surprising amount of overlap in marker expression between the ExEn and DE, making it difficult to distinguish between these cell types by marker analysis. This is significant for two main reasons. First, because endodermal organs, such as the liver and pancreas, play important physiological roles in adult animals, much experimental effort has been directed in recent years toward the establishment of protocols for the efficient derivation of endodermal cell types in vitro. Conversely, factors secreted by the VE play pivotal roles that cannot be attributed to the DE in early axis formation, heart formation and the patterning of the anterior nervous system. Thus, efforts in both of these areas have been hampered by a lack of markers that clearly distinguish between ExEn and DE. To further understand the ExEn we have undertaken a comparative analysis of three ExEn-like cell lines (END2, PYS2 and XEN). PYS2 cells are derived from embryonal carcinomas (EC) of 129 strain mice and have been characterized as parietal endoderm-like [1], END2 cells are derived from P19 ECs and described as visceral endoderm-like, while XEN cells are derived from blastocyst stage embryos and are described as primitive endoderm-like. Our analysis suggests that none of these cell lines represent a bona fide single in vivo lineage. Both PYS2 and XEN cells represent mixed populations expressing markers for several ExEn lineages. Conversely END2 cells, which were previously characterized as VE-like, fail to express many markers that are widely expressed in the VE, but instead express markers for only a subset of the VE, the anterior visceral endoderm. In addition END2 cells also express markers for the PE. We extended these observations with microarray analysis which was used to probe and refine previously published data sets of genes proposed to distinguish between DE and VE. Finally, genome-wide pathway analysis revealed that SMAD-independent TGFbeta signaling through a TAK1/p38/JNK or TAK1/NLK pathway may represent one mode of intracellular signaling shared by all three of these lines, and suggests that factors downstream of these pathways may mediate some functions of the ExEn. These studies represent the first step in the development of XEN cells as a powerful molecular genetic tool to study the endodermal signals that mediate the important developmental functions of the extra-embryonic endoderm. Our data refine our current knowledge of markers that distinguish various subtypes of endoderm. In addition, pathway analysis suggests that the ExEn may mediate some of its functions through a non-classical MAP Kinase signaling pathway downstream of TAK1."

Preeclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) are associated with impaired trophoblast invasion and spiral artery transformation. Recent studies have suggested that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta3 is overexpressed in the placenta of PE patients and that this may be responsible for failed trophoblast invasion. There are, however, no studies on TGF-betas in the placenta in FGR or in the placental bed in PE or FGR. In this study we have used immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to examine the expression of TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and TGF-beta3 in placenta and placental bed of pregnancies complicated by PE and FGR and matched control pregnancies. The results show that TGF-beta1, -beta2, and -beta3 are not expressed in villous trophoblasts but are present within the placenta. TGF-beta1, -beta2, and, to a much lesser extent, TGF-beta3 were present within the placental bed but only TGF-beta2 was present in extravillous trophoblast. No changes in expression of either isoform were found in placenta or placental bed in PE or FGR compared with normal pregnancy. These data are not consistent with overexpression of TGF-beta3 being responsible for failed trophoblast invasion in PE.

CD010864,0,17655983,0,Purification and structure characterization of the active component in the pneumococcal 22F polysaccharide capsule used for adsorption in pneumococcal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.,"Protection against pneumococcal disease is thought to be mediated primarily by antibodies that are opsonic [Musher DM, Chapman AJ, Goree A, Jonsson S, Briles D, Baughn RE. Natural and vaccine-related immunity to Streptococcus pneumoniae. J Infect Dis 1986;154(2):245-56]. Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is immunogenic and induces type-specific protective immunity. For convenience, the protective capacity of serum antibodies is often evaluated by the measurement of antibody titers in an ELISA test. The pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (CPS) used in ELISA contains several impurities; these include about 5% by weight of teicholic acid (CWPS) and the cholin binding protein, pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) [Sorensen UB, Henrichsen J. C-polysaccharide in a pneumococcal vaccine. Acta Pathol Microbiol Immunol Scand C 1984;92(6):351-6; Yu J, Briles DE, Englund JA, Hollingshead SK, Glezen WP, Nahm MH. Immunogenic protein contaminants in pneumococcal vaccines. J Infect Dis 2003;187(6):1019-23]. All individuals have antibodies to CWPS possible as a result of early exposure to pneumococci, Streptocuccus mitis and Streptocuccus oralis [Bergstrom N, Jansson PE, Kilian M, Skov Sorensen UB. Structures of two cell wall-associated polysaccharides of a Streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strain. A unique teichoic acid-like polysaccharide and the group O antigen which is a C-polysaccharide in common with pneumococci. Eur J Biochem 2000;267(24):7147-57. [4]]. The concentration of the CWPS antibodies in non-immunized individuals often exceeds the concentration of the serotype-specific pneumococcal antibodies. Therefore, the pneumococcal ELISA requires an adsorption step to remove the unprotective CWPS antibodies [Konradsen HB, Sorensen UB, Henrichsen J. A modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measuring type-specific anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antibodies. J Immunol Meth 1993;164(1):13-20. [5]; Concepcion N, Frasch CE.

Pediatr Infect Dis J 1987;6 (6):519-26. [8]]. Recently a new pneumococcal CPS ELISA was recommended with an extra serum absorption step with 22F CPS to remove antibodies against an extra unknown common cross-reactive component. The aim of this study was to characterize the active component in the 22F capsule. A non-capsulated pneumococci was prepared from a 22F capsulated pneumococci. The cell wall polysaccharide (CWPS2) purified from this pneumococci has a better adsorption potential than 22F capsule in the pneumococci ELISA. Structure characterization of the commercial available CWPS and CWPS2 was done by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR results showed that commercial CWPS had one phosporylcholine per sugar repeat while the CWPS2 had two phosporylcholine per sugar repeat explaining an immunological difference between the two variants of CWPS. In addition the LicD2 gene responsible for the attachment of the second cholin in the CWPS tetra sugar repeat was inactive in the strain used for purifying the commercial CWPS but active in the strain expressing CWPS2."

CD010864,0,10593432,0,Observer dependency of the SimpliRed D-dimer assay in 81 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"The SimpliRed D-dimer assay is a whole blood agglutination test for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) and has been advocated as a reliable rapid bedside alternative to more time-consuming quantitative assays. However, widely differing negative predictive values (77-100%) are reported. This study assessed the intra- and interobserver variability as a possible cause for this wide accuracy range and evaluated the accuracy of the SimpliRed test in 81 consecutive patients with clinically suspected PE. Absolute D-dimer concentration was measured using the Tinaquant (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) assay. Every assay was immediately scored by one observer and then photographed. Photos were randomised and read twice by two other independent observers. The intraobserver reproducibility was good: kappa=0.81 and 0.73. However, we found poor interobserver reproducibility with kappa=0.47. This seems due to the fact that the SimpliRed test proved difficult to interpret in the 0.3-1.3 microg/mL plasma concentration D-dimer range, which contained 32/81 (40%) patients, 8 of whom had PE. Using pulmonary angiograms and ventilation perfusion lung scans with a concurrent spiral computed tomography scan as a gold standard (25 patients had PE), SimpliRed's accuracy to exclude PE was moderate, with negative predictive values of 0.78 and 0.84. In particular, the two observers scored the SimpliRed test as normal in 12 of 25 and 5 of 25 patients with proven PE. We conclude that SimpliRed is strongly observer-dependent. This explains the varying sensitivities for the detection of venous thromboembolism as reported in previous studies."

CD010864,0,19330263,0,High levels of serum mannose-binding lectin are associated with the severity of clinical signs of leptospirosis.,"The clinical heterogeneity observed in leptospirosis may be associated with host factors or bacteria virulence. Human serum mannose-binding lectin (MBL) recognizes many pathogens, and low levels of this lectin are associated with susceptibility to infection. MBL is also implicated in the modulation of the inflammatory process. We determined the levels of serum MBL during leptospirosis infection. A double-antibody sandwich ELISA was used to detect the immunoreactive serum MBL. The ELISA plates were coated with monoclonal antibody to MBL and bound MBL or recombinant human MBL were detected by rabbit anti-human MBL serum. HRPO-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used for detection of the reaction. Two groups of patients seen at referral hospitals in Recife, PE, Brazil, were divided according to the year of infection, 2001 (N = 61) or 2002 (N = 57) and compared in terms of disease severity and levels of serum MBL. A group of healthy volunteers (N = 97) matched by age, gender, and ethnic background was used as control. Patients infected in 2001 had more severe outcomes than those infected in 2002, including jaundice, hemorrhage, respiratory alteration, and renal complication (P = 0.0009; chi-square test). The frequency of patients producing serum MBL >1000 ng/mL was higher in the 2001 group than in the 2002 and control groups (P < 0.01), suggesting an association of MBL level with disease severity. The involvement of MBL and genetic variation of the MBL2 gene should be further evaluated to establish the role of this lectin in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis."

CD010864,0,22688933,0,"Chest pain, dyspnoea and elevated D-dimer in a recent air traveller.","A previously asymptomatic 69-year-old lady, who recently travelled on a 4 h flight, presented with acute left-sided pleuritic pain, dyspnoea and calf pain. Blood gases revealed hypoxaemia and D-dimer was significantly elevated. She also had low-grade fever, leukocytosis and a small left-sided pleural effusion on chest x-ray. The working diagnosis was pulmonary embolism and chest infection and she received low molecular weight heparin and antibiotics. A subsequent CT pulmonary angiogram ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed an abnormal finding in the ascending aorta, suggestive of a penetrating aortic ulcer. Urgent transoesophageal echocardiography was consistent with an intramural haematoma and the patient underwent emergency aortic root replacement with imminent aortic rupture confirmed at surgery. This case highlights the fact that acute aortic syndromes may have atypical presentations and also emphasises the fact that D-dimer levels are elevated in aortic syndromes."
CD010864,0,1522353,0,The prevalence of vascular occlusive disease associated with antiphospholipid syndromes.,"The association of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) with unexplained vascular occlusive disease (VOD) is well known. We reviewed the records of 102 consecutive patients seen over a 9 months period who had positive IgG or IgM aCL to determine the frequency and types of VOD in this unselected group of patients. Lupus anticoagulant was detectable in 17 of 67 (25%) patients tested. VOD occurred in 80 of 102 (78%) aCL-positive patients comprised of 17 (16.7%) with systemic venous VOD or pulmonary embolism; 27 (26.5%) with cerebral VOD: 11 (10.8%) with systemic arterial VOD; 3 (2.9%) with coronary thrombosis; and 5 (4.9%) with visceral venous or arterial VOD. Of the 19 obstetric patients with positive aCL, 17 (89%) had at least one unexplained fetal loss and 8 of the 17 (47%) had multiple or recurrent fetal losses. Twelve (11.7%) of the 102 patients met the ACR criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Additionally, 12 (11.7%) patients were identified as nonSLE or undifferentiated connective tissue disease (CTD). The remaining 78 (76%) had no known underlying disease (primary antiphospholipid syndrome). We conclude that IgG and IgM aCL with or without lupus anticoagulant are associated with diverse types of VOD but cerebral VOD appears predominant. aCL-associated unexplained VOD occurs frequently in patients without evidence of CTD-65 of 80 (81%) in our series. Testing for aCL is essential for identifying patients with unexplained VOD, and it should be performed in prospective clinical studies of such patients to better define the pathogenic role of aCL in the natural history of unexplained VOD."
CD010864,0,7609297,0,Blood coagulation and fibrinolytic activity during femoral neck prosthetic replacement using bone cement.,"To assess the blood coagulative and fibrinolytic responses during cemented femoral neck replacement, we measured these parameters in 9 patients, including anti-thrombin III (AT-III), prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) before surgery, just before packing bone cement and after the insertion of the prosthesis. We also measured thrombin-anti-thrombin III complex (TAT), plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), and D-dimer. A significant increase in APTT, and decrease in AT-III and PT were observed before the insertion of bone cement and prosthesis. The value of TAT and D-dimer increased significantly after the insertion of the prosthesis, but there were no significant changes in PIC. The data suggest that blood coagulation is activated after the insertion of bone cement and prosthesis into the femoral shaft, and in addition, the fibrinolysis is also accelerated secondary to the activation of the coagulation. Further investigations are needed to establish whether the activation of the coagulation induced by the cemented replacement exerts a great influence on the appearance of pulmonary thrombosis or circulatory depression."

The critical changes of this state include the increase of vascular resistance and hypoperfusion in the uteroplacental microcirculation that predispose to hypoxia and ischemia and, therefore, increased oxidative stress through 8-isoprostane, which is characterized by damage to the placenta and endothelium. We undertook this study to compare oxidative stress in pregnant women with PE."
CD010864,0,23677197,0,[Risk stratification of pulmonary thromboembolism].,"The prognosis of pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) is related to the cardiopulmonary reserve of the patient and the magnitude of the embolus that impacts pulmonary circulation. The presence of hemodynamic instability (shock) stratifies a group of patients with high mortality, which should be treated with thrombolysis. Patients without shock but with right ventricular dysfunction can have a dismal evolution and should be managed aggressively. CAT scan, echocardiography and serum markers can be of value to define patients with a higher mortality. The available evidence to define the best diagnostic and therapeutic strategy is scanty, controversial and inconclusive. A good combination of clinical, imaging and biological markers should be defined to identify those patients without shock but with a high rate of complications and mortality, that could benefit from aggressive treatments."

CD010864,0,15867411,0,Narrative review: alternative causes for elevated cardiac troponin levels when acute coronary syndromes are excluded.,"Current guidelines for the diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are largely based on an elevated troponin level. While this rapid and sensitive blood test is certainly valuable in the appropriate setting, its widespread use in a variety of clinical scenarios may lead to the detection of troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes. Many diseases, such as sepsis, hypovolemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, and renal failure, can be associated with an increase in troponin level. These elevations may arise from various causes other than thrombotic coronary artery occlusion. Given the lack of any supportive data at present, patients with nonthrombotic troponin elevation should not be treated with antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents. Rather, the underlying cause of the troponin elevation should be targeted. However, troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes still retains prognostic value. Thus, cardiac troponin elevations are common in numerous disease states and do not necessarily indicate the presence of a thrombotic acute coronary syndrome. While troponin is a sensitive biomarker to ""rule out"" non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, it is less useful to ""rule in"" this event because it may lack specificity for acute coronary syndromes."
CD010864,0,19667418,0,Surrogate Gaussian first derivative curves for determination of decision levels and confidence intervals by binary logistic regression.,"It has been demonstrated that decision levels (DL) and their confidence intervals (CI) can be estimated from the second derivative, f '' (P), of the logistic regression probability curve (LRPC). Although this method generally provides smooth curves from which DL and CI can be obtained, there are datasets that generate ""noisy"" curves making these measurements difficult. The purpose of this study was to develop a procedure to obviate this noise, thus allowing the more facile estimation of DL and CI. Data from two clinical studies were examined. Logistic regression analysis was performed and the first derivatives, f ' (P), were fitted to Gaussian models. The derivatives of these surrogate f ' (P) were generated to provide f '' (P) and were compared with data from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. For both sets of data, the surrogate curves demonstrated strong fits to the natural f ' (P) with r(2) = 0.986 for one study and 0.832 for the second. The f '' (P) generated from the surrogate curves demonstrated single maxima (M) and minima (m), compared with the f '' (P) generated from the natural f ' (P) in which multiple M and m were observed. Easily discernible DL and CI were observed for both datasets with differences from ROC-estimated DL of 1.7% for the first study and 4.8% for the second. The use of a surrogate Gaussian simulation of f ' (P) may be a useful alternative to natural f ' (P) when using the f '' (P) of the LRPC to determine DL and CI."
CD010864,0,12694541,0,Effect of plasma exchange in combination with deoxyspergualin on the survival of guinea-pig hearts in macrophage-depleted C6-deficient rats.,"The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of plasma exchange (PE) in combination with certain immunosuppressive agents on the survival of guinea-pig hearts in C6-deficient (C6-) rats. To deplete macrophages, we gave liposome-encapsulated dichloromethylene diphosphonate (Lip-Cl2MDP) intravenously (i.v.) in a dose of 10 mg/kg on day 2 before transplantation and every 5 days until rejection. Deoxyspergualin (DSG) was also given i.v. in a dose of 10 mg/kg/day from day -2 until rejection. Plasma exchange was performed 1 day before xenografting. All animals were splenectomized just before heart transplantation. Heart xenografts were evaluated twice daily and harvested at the time of rejection. The serum levels of anti-guinea-pig xenoreactive antibody (IgM, IgG) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Graft survival was 2.8 +/- 0.5 days in control rats, and 4.0 +/- 0.3 days with PE alone. A combination of PE with Lip-Cl2MDP or DSG did not improve the results (4.2 +/- 0.6 days vs. 4.8 +/- 0.6 days, respectively). While in rats treated with PE and the combination of Lip-Cl2MDP and DSG, graft survival was significantly prolonged (6.9 +/- 1.1 days, P < 0.01 vs. controls). In untreated control rats, xenoreactive antibody (IgM, IgG) levels decreased immediately after PE, but their levels rapidly returned to normal. In rats treated with DSG or DSG + Lip-Cl2MDP, the IgM levels remained low during the observation period. Immunohistochemistry showed that macrophage infiltration into the graft was suppressed in Lip-Cl2MDP-treated groups at the time of rejection. Our results demonstrate that sustained suppression of antibody levels can be achieved by PE in combination with DSG and xenograft survival is further prolonged in macrophage-depleted C6- rats. These findings suggest that strategies targeting antibody and macrophages may be useful in prolonging xenograft survival."
CD010864,0,9445958,0,[Evaluation of analyses for exclusion of suspected thrombosis. Do not rely on the D-dimer test!].,"The reliability of D-dimer (NycoCard D-dimer) and CRP (C-reactive protein) tests to exclude suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) was investigated in 116 patients. Venography, ultrasonography or ventilation-perfusion lung scanning was used as the control method in 95, 5, and 14 patients, respectively, and pulmonary angiography in two patients, one of whom also underwent lung scanning, the other venography. Of the 116 patients, 52 had thromboembolism (46 DVT and 6 PE). The respective sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values (NPV, PPV) were 94%, 27%, 85% and 51% for the D-dimer test, and 80%, 53% 76% and 60% for the CRP test. As venous thromboembolism is a life-threatening condition, the NPV of an exclusion test must lie very close to 100 per cent, and thus the study showed neither the D-dimer nor the CRP test to be a satisfactory exclusion test for use in cases of suspected DVT or PE."
CD010864,0,23316966,0,Matrix metalloproteinases as drug targets in acute pulmonary embolism.,"Acute pulmonary embolism is a critical condition associated with increased mortality. Lung embolization causes acute pulmonary hypertension and right ventricle afterload. Global heart ischemia supervenes and may lead to severe shock and death. In this article, we reviewed current literature supporting the idea that abnormal matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity contributes to acute pulmonary embolism-induced hemodynamic changes. While low MMP levels are usually found in normal lung tissues, it is well known that inflammation and lung injury increase MMP expression and activity. This is probably due to recruitment and migration of inflammatory cells from the circulation to lung tissues. In addition, recent studies have shown increased MMP levels and activity in the right ventricle from animals with acute pulmonary embolism. Such increases in proteolytic activity were associated with increased cardiac troponin I in serum, suggesting a possible role for MMPs in cardiomyocyte injury during acute pulmonary embolism. These alterations have justified the use of doxycycline as an MMP inhibitor in acute pulmonary embolism. We review current evidence indicating that MMPs are targets in this critical condition. MMP inhibition apparently exerts antihypertensive effects and protects against cardiomyocyte injury caused by acute pulmonary embolism."

CD010864,0,9421077,0,Pure pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas of the uterus.,"Pure rhabdomyosarcoma arising in the uterus is a rare tumor currently classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a uterine sarcoma. The records of eight women with uterine rhabdomyosarcomas were retrieved from the files of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). The eight women presented with vaginal bleeding, abdominal enlargement, or acute abdomen. The mean age of the patients was 64.6 years (range 35-87). Macroscopically, 4 tumors were polypoid endometrial masses, 2 were intramyometrial, 1 was located in the cervix, and 1 was a 15-cm mass involving the endometrium and myometrium with direct extension into the small intestine. Microscopically, the tumors consisted of a variable proportion of large rhabdomyoblasts admixed with smaller round, polygonal, and spindle-shaped cells. No epithelial elements were identified on light microscopy. Tissue from the extrauterine and metastatic lesions was available for review in four cases and also showed pure rhabdomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemical assessment of seven tumors supported the sarcomatous nature of the neoplastic cells. Six patients died of disease within 15 months of initial diagnosis and 1 patient died of a pulmonary embolus. The patient whose 15-cm tumor had extended into the small intestine survived 6 years; she died of a presumed pancreatic carcinoma. Presenting mainly in elderly women, uterine pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas are rare, highly malignant tumors with frequent extrauterine spread at presentation. Patients rarely survive beyond 15 months."

The plasma thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha levels in 1 patient were measured and proved to be 160 and 20 times higher than the control level, respectively. When 0.5 ml of plasma from each patient was given intravenously into Balb/c mice, the mice died within 5 min.

However, reports on an association between cholangiocarcinoma and pulmonary thromboembolism, thus far, are almost lacking. We present here an unusual case of a 56-yr-old patient presenting cholangiocarcinoma and unexplained pulmonary thromboembolism. The patient had been quite healthy before the diagnosis. Coagulation tests showed elevated levels of fibrinogen, fibrinogen degradation product (FDP), D-dimer, and IgM anticardiolipin antibody (aCL Ab). The thromboemboli were resolved 3 weeks after anticoagulant therapy using low molecular-weight-heparin. Then, follow-up coagulation tests showed a marked decrease to normal in aCL Ab titer as well as the normalization of FDP and D-dimer levels. In this case, we describe pulmonary thromboembolism caused by hypercoagulable state associated with cholangiocarcinoma and speculate that such a thrombotic phenomenon could be regressed by anticoagulant therapy."

CD010864,0,2547423,0,Congenital severe protein C deficiency in adults.,"Two unrelated families are described, of which four adult members were found to be suffering from severe protein C deficiency (less than or equal to 5% of normal plasma level). Newborn deaths were reported in the first family but the second family had no history of neonatal purpura fulminans and infant death. Thrombotic symptoms developed mainly in their early twenties, consisting chiefly of recurrent superficial and deep iliofemoral vein thromboses and pulmonary emboli. Other clinical features included generalized peritonitis due to massive mesenteric vein thrombosis, thrombosis of the cavernus sinus, renal vein thrombosis and priapism. In the second family, five members (all aged approximately 40 years) died of intravascular abdominal thrombosis. Massive thromboembolic episodes were associated with a compensated disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome as evidenced by high concentrations of D-dimer (mean levels 5000 ng/ml plasma) and by a moderate reduction in platelet count and fibrinogen concentrations. D-dimer levels in noncrisis periods were also raised above normal (mean levels 400 ng/ml). The thrombotic problems of these patients were controlled satisfactorily by long-term administration of low molecular weight heparin alone or in combination with low dose warfarin."
CD010864,0,15471433,0,Rapid response of hepatocyte growth factor in pulmonary ischemia in a rat model.,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multifunctional factor implicated in tissue regeneration, wound healing, and angiogenesis. HGF was initially thought to be liver-specific, but it has become clear that HGF acts on alveolar type II cells and bronchial epithelial cells. This study was conducted to determine the role of HGF in pulmonary ischemia in a rat model. The first increase of the plasma HGF level was noted 30 min after pulmonary ischemia, and reached a peak at 12 h. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (Real-time RT-PCR) revealed that the HGF messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the injured left lung was markedly increased at 1, 6, and 12 h after pulmonary ischemia (P < 0.05). The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) mRNA expression, one of the inflammatory cytokines which induces HGF expression, was markedly increased at 1 h in the injured left lung (P = 0.0007). Therefore, we considered that HGF might be mainly induced by paracrine mechanisms in pulmonary ischemia. In conclusion, we have shown that the expression of HGF was induced in pulmonary ischemia, and may be a useful biological marker for the early diagnosis."
CD010864,0,10218429,0,[Difficulties in the detection of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II].,"We report about a 29 year old female who developed right-sided leg vein thrombosis over three levels. Thrombectomy was attempted followed by intravenous anticoagulation with heparin. The platelet count dropped acutely from 176,000/microliter to 11,000/microliter after the sixth day. A lung perfusion-ventilation-scintigraphy suggested recent pulmonary embolism by lateral, predominantly right-sided perfusion deficits. ACT scan of the pelvic region showed rethrombosis of the right common iliac vein. The clinical suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II was confirmed by a positive heparin-induced platelet aggregation test and the detection of antibodies by heparin-platelet factor 4-ELISA. The patient was treated with lepirudin at body-weight-adapted dose. After recovery of the platelet count to 102,000/microliter within seven days the treatment was changed to Orgaran after exclusion of immunologic cross reactivity. An overlapping oral anticoagulation with Marcoumar was initiated. Although HIT type II usually develops over a few days, acute thrombopenia can also occur. There is therefore no safe diagnostic interval permitting a timely detection."
CD010864,0,16981176,0,Quantifying the treatment effect explained by markers in the presence of measurement error.,"Surrogate markers or intermediate markers are important in identifying subjects with high risk of a serious disease or for monitoring disease progression of a subject on treatment. Quantifying the proportion of treatment effect (PTE) explained by markers has been studied extensively. Due to reasons such as biological variation, limited machine precision, etc. markers are generally measured with error. The estimated PTE ignoring the measurement error could be biased, which may lead to incorrect conclusions. In this article, we adjust for the measurement error using regression calibration to construct a less biased estimator of excess relative odds, a quantity to measure the treatment effect explained by markers. The method is applied to data from a clinical study in osteoporosis."

Timing of D-Dimer evaluation in relation to the onset of the disease might have a diagnostic impact. We have presently performed a retrospective analysis of diagnostic procedures performed in individuals who presented to the Emergency department and evaluated for acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) following a single quantitative D-Dimer testing. Individuals who had a negative objective test served as controls to those who had a positive one (Doppler ultrasonography, high probability lung scan or a CT angiography). Seven hundred thirty-four individuals presented to the Emergency department, performed a single D-Dimer test as well as an objective test during their evaluation for an eventual event of acute VTE. One hundred ninety-seven patients had a positive objective test for either deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolus. They were divided into seven tiles of times from symptoms onset. Highly significant differences between patients and controls regarding D-Dimer concentrations were noted mainly during the early days from symptom onset and turned less significant thereafter. Taking into consideration the time from symptoms onset in patients with acute VTE might have an effect on the diagnostic yield of quantitative D-Dimer in the Emergency department. We suggest not to exclude the eventual presence of acute VTE if quantitative D-Dimer is obtained later than 1 week following the onset of symptoms."

We describe a 35-year-old woman who developed severe thrombotic complications due to heparinization and unrecognized HDAs. She had received subcutaneous heparin as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis during a 5-day hospitalization for postpartum cardiomyopathy. Five days after discharge (day 1), she developed bilateral lower extremity arterial thrombi and underwent heparinization and successful lower extremity thrombectomies. A pulmonary embolus and hepatic and renal infarcts were then found. On days 2-6, the patient experienced a myocardial infarction, ischemic cerebrovascular accident, recurrent lower extremity arterial thrombus, and splenic infarct. On day 7, blood obtained on day 4 was found to be strongly positive for HDAs. In the interim, the patient had been transitioned to warfarin. Her platelet counts were never less than 75% of baseline and were consistently above 200 x 10(3)/mm(3). Hypercoagulability studies were negative. The patient's score on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated that the relationship between this adverse reaction and heparin was probable. An extensive MEDLINE search located 22 other reports of patients who developed HDAs, sometimes associated with thrombosis, but whose platelet counts did not decrease. As with our patient, many of these case reports described clinicians who overlooked thrombosis due to HDAs because the patients did not have HIT. Clinicians should be cognizant of this possibility and consider a diagnosis of HDAs in patients with ongoing thrombosis who are receiving heparin therapy. It is strongly recommended that heparin be substituted with another anticoagulant in such cases until the presence of HDAs can be definitively ruled out."

CD010864,0,17555115,0,[Diagnosis and management of deep venous thrombosis].,"Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common condition that can lead to complications such as postphlebitic syndrome, pulmonary embolism and death. Currently, an algorithm strategy combining pretest probability, D-dimer testing and compression ultrasonography imaging allows for safe and convenient estimation of suspected lower-limb thrombosis. The mainstay of treatment is anticoagulation therapy. The use of low-molecular-weight heparin or pentasaccharide (fondaparinux) allows for outpatient management of most patients with DVT. The duration of anticoagulation depends on whether the primary event was idiopathic or secondary to a transient risk factor. Interventions such as thrombolysis and placement of inferior vena cava filter are reserved for special situations."

CD010864,0,22747852,0,The enteric bacterial metabolite propionic acid alters brain and plasma phospholipid molecular species: further development of a rodent model of autism spectrum disorders.,"Gastrointestinal symptoms and altered blood phospholipid profiles have been reported in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Most of the phospholipid analyses have been conducted on the fatty acid composition of isolated phospholipid classes following hydrolysis. A paucity of information exists on how the intact phospholipid molecular species are altered in ASD. We applied ESI/MS to determine how brain and blood intact phospholipid species were altered during the induction of ASD-like behaviors in rats following intraventricular infusions with the enteric bacterial metabolite propionic acid. Animals were infused daily for 8âdays, locomotor activity assessed, and animals killed during the induced behaviors. Propionic acid infusions increased locomotor activity. Lipid analysis revealed treatment altered 21 brain and 30 blood phospholipid molecular species. Notable alterations were observed in the composition of brain SM, diacyl mono and polyunsaturated PC, PI, PS, PE, and plasmalogen PC and PE molecular species. These alterations suggest that the propionic acid rat model is a useful tool to study aberrations in lipid metabolism known to affect membrane fluidity, peroxisomal function, gap junction coupling capacity, signaling, and neuroinflammation, all of which may be associated with the pathogenesis of ASD."
CD010864,0,15929111,0,Effect of plasma exchange on cytokines measured by multianalyte bead array in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"The serum cytokine profile in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has not been extensively characterized. In this pilot study, a novel technique was utilized to evaluate multiple cytokines in patients with idiopathic TTP during a course of plasma exchange (PE). Single serum samples were obtained from five TTP patients before and after each PE. Random sera were obtained from nine healthy volunteers who served as controls. The samples were evaluated for 13 cytokines (IL-1B, IL-2 , IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha) using the Luminex bead array (LINCOplex) multianalyte detection system that permits simultaneous detection of multiple cytokines from a single sample. Each patient received 4-6 PEs (Cobe Spectra) with 3.0-4.0 L of fresh frozen plasma as replacement fluid. Four of 5 patients received corticosteroids prior to and during PE. The control group did not receive steroids. Baseline values for IL-8 (182.9 vs. 6.5 pg/mL, P < 0.05) and TNF-alpha (11.4 vs. 0.9 pg/mL, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in TTP patients compared with controls. Other tested cytokines were not significantly different between the two groups. Comparison of cytokine values pre- and post-PE indicate a substantial decrease after each PE. However, cytokines rebounded to abnormal levels by the following day. There was no correlation between cytokines and serum LDH or platelet count. These findings suggest that certain cytokines, particularly IL-8 and TNF-alpha, are altered in TTP, and this may indicate a direct role in TTP pathogenesis, reflect ongoing tissue injury, or perhaps indicate an inadequate attempt to limit tissue injury."

CD010864,0,17474499,0,[Idiopathic venous thromboembolic disease. risk factors for recurrence in 2006].,"The duration of anticoagulant therapy after a first attack of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) is related to the risk of recurrence and the iatrogenic complication of bleeding. Recent prospective trials have provided information concerning the clinical and biological profiles of those at greatest risk of recurrence of deep vein thrombosis. The value of ultrasonic investigations and of D-Dimer measurements have also been assessed. The risk of recurrence is not negligible, about 10% in the first year after stopping treatment and 2/3 of recurrences occurring in the first two years. There are several risk factors for recurrence: male gender, past history of renal transplant, presence of malignant disease, proximal site of the initial thrombosis, initial presentation with pulmonary embolism, previous deep vein thrombosis and the co-existence of two thrombophilic factors. On the other hand, age, single deep vein thrombosis and a family history of deep vein thrombosis are not significantly related to increased risk. The presence of a residual thrombus at the end of treatment remains a subject of controversy. The risk of recurrence when the D-Dimers are normal one month after stopping the anticoagulants seems to be low, especially in cases of an associated thrombophilia. Finally, the risk of haemorrhage is related to the duration of oral anticoagulant therapy and the age of the patient. These trials have provided information for the issue of recommendations by consensus conferences and allow better economic evaluation of the duration of treatment after a first episode of deep vein thrombosis with respect to differing clinical situations."
CD010864,0,21351657,0,[Diagnosis and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism in 2010].,"Diagnostic approaches in acute pulmonary embolism include evaluation of clinical likelihood, D-dimers, echocardiography and spiral CT angiography and pulmonary scintigraphy. Determination of D-dimers is only meaningful in patients with low or intermediate clinical likelihood. It is safe not to initiate anticoagulation treatment (or to discontinue such treatment) in patients with low clinical likelihood of acute pulmonary embolism and negative D-dimer test (only if methods with 99-100% sensitivity are used). Duplex sonography and pulmonary scintigraphy are only necessary at the centres with a first generation spiral CT and not those with multidetector devices. Investigations in normotensive patients should include echocardiography that should also include assessment of the right ventricular function using echocardiography and determination of biomarkers of pulmonary embolism. Right ventricular dysfunction together with elevated troponins identifies a normotensive group at an increases risk. Highly sensitive troponin T (hsTnT) appears to be particularly valuable. Echocardiography reading might the decisive factor for treatment initiation in patients with massive acute pulmonary embolism. Negative or unclear echocardiography finding warrants spiral CT angiography (CTA). Ventilation/perfusion scan or pulmonary arteriography are recommendable in patients with unclear CTA finding and patients with high clinical likelihood of pulmonary embolism and negative CTA finding. A combination of CTA and CTV also appears useful as it increases the overall sensitivity of the investigation and enables imaging of pelvic veins. Thrombolytic treatment is indicated in haemodynamically unstable patients, patients with a high risk of a massive pulmonary embolism associated with cardiogenic shock or hypotension (systolic pressure below 90 mmHg or a decrease in systolic pressure by > 40 mmHg) or symptoms of acute right-sided heart failure. Thrombolytic treatment is also indicated in pulmonary embolism not receding following heparin treatment, in recurring or expanding pulmonary embolism, in the presence of thrombi in the right heart and in patients with right-to-left shunting through patent foramen ovale. This treatment should also be considered in patients with submassive pulmonary embolism associated with a dysfunction of the right ventricle and increased troponins, and particularly in patients lacking even a relative contraindication of thrombolytic treatment. A thrombolytic of choice is alteplase. Embolectomy or catheterization should be used if thrombolytic treatment is contraindicated or ineffective. Long-term monitoring of massive and submassive acute pulmonary embolism is highly recommended. Low molecular weight heparins or unfractioned heparin or fondaparinux are used in haemodynamically stable patients."

CD010864,0,22685662,0,Inflammatory disturbances in preeclampsia: relationship between maternal and umbilical cord blood.,"Preeclampsia (PE) is one of the main causes of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. PE is associated with an inflammatory state and with oxidative stress, in maternal circulation. Our aim was to evaluate and compare the levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in maternal and umbilical cord blood (UCB), in normal and PE pregnancies. We measured acute-phase proteins (CRP and Î±1-antitrypsin), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-Î±), leukocyte activation (elastase, lactoferrin, sL-selectin, sVCAM, sPECAM), total antioxidant status (TAS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and uric acid levels. We studied 42 healthy pregnant women, 46 PE women, and their neonates. The concentrations of IL-6, TNF-Î±, Î±1-antitrypsin, CRP, sVCAM, uric acid, and TBARS were significantly higher, and sL-selectin was significantly lower in PE pregnant women as compared with normotensive pregnant women. In newborns uric acid, Î±1-antitrypsin, and CRP values were significantly higher in PE; leukocyte count, sL-selectin, lactoferrin, and the ratio elastase/Î±1-antitrypsin were significantly lower. Our data suggest that PE pregnancy is associated with an enhanced maternal inflammatory condition, which is reflected in fetal circulation. This enhanced inflammatory state seems to be related to endothelial dysfunction and increased cytokine synthesis, rather than with neutrophil activation."
CD010864,0,20678914,0,Impedimetric immunosensor based on SWCNT-COOH modified gold microelectrodes for label-free detection of deep venous thrombosis biomarker.,"Measurement of D-dimer has subsequently become an essential element in the diagnostics of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; in this context microelectrodes with an area of 9Ã10(-4) cm(2) were used to develop impedimetric immunosensor for detecting deep venous thrombosis biomarker (D-dimer). The biosensor is based on functionalized carbon nanotubes (SWCNT-COOH) where the antibody (anti-D-dimer) was immobilized by covalent binding. The electrical properties and the morphology of the biolayer were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry and atomic force spectroscopy (AFM). Impedimetric microimmunosensor allows to obtain sensitivity of 40.1 kÎ© Î¼M(-1) and detection limit of 0.1 pg/mL (0.53 fM) with linear range from 0.1 pg/mL to 2 Î¼g/mL (0.53 fM to 0.01 Î¼M).

Moreover, the studied immunosensor exhibits good reproducibility (R.S.D. 8.2%, n=4)."
CD010864,0,8883270,0,Phosphatidylethanolamine induces specific conformational changes in the kininogens recognizable by antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies.,"Autoantibodies to the zwitterionic phospholipid (PL), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) have been described in patients with thrombotic diseases. Recently, we reported that many antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies (aPE) are not specific for PE per se, but are directed to plasma proteins which can bind PE, for example, high molecular weight kininogen (HK), low molecular weight kininogen (LK) and/or proteins in complex with HK, factor XI or prekallikrein. In the ELISA, we now show that intact HK binds to all PL tested. By using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the HK light chain, binding to cardiolipin (CL) was highest followed by phosphatidylserine (PS), PE and phosphatidylcholine (PC). By contrast, LK bound best to PE, with lesser amounts binding to PC and CL. Many aPE recognize only a kininogen-PE complex and neither PE nor kininogen when they are tested independently. We now report that these aPE are specific for the kininogen-PE complex as they do not recognize the kininogens when the latter are presented on other PL substrates. This indicates that PE induces unique antigenic conformational changes in the kininogens which are not induced when the kininogens bind to other PL. The kininogens bind to platelets and endothelial cells through an as yet undefined receptor. Since PE is a normal constituent of the outer layer of cell and platelet plasma membranes, it is available for the kininogens to bind. In vitro studies showed that purified IgG which bound kininogen-PE complexes in ELISA also caused platelets to undergo irreversible aggregation when stimulated by subthreshold concentrations of bovine thrombin."

CD010864,0,19008457,0,D-dimer antigen: current concepts and future prospects.,"The D-dimer antigen is a unique marker of fibrin degradation that is formed by the sequential action of 3 enzymes: thrombin, factor XIIIa, and plasmin. First, thrombin cleaves fibrinogen producing fibrin monomers, which polymerize and serve as a template for factor XIIIa and plasmin formation. Second, thrombin activates plasma factor XIII bound to fibrin polymers to produce the active transglutaminase, factor XIIIa. Factor XIIIa catalyzes the formation of covalent bonds between D-domains in the polymerized fibrin. Finally, plasmin degrades the crosslinked fibrin to release fibrin degradation products and expose the D-dimer antigen. D-dimer antigen can exist on fibrin degradation products derived from soluble fibrin before its incorporation into a fibrin gel, or after the fibrin clot has been degraded by plasmin. The clinical utility of D-dimer measurement has been established in some scenarios, most notably for the exclusion of VTE. This article consists of 2 sections: in the first, the dynamics of D-dimer antigen formation is discussed and an overview of commercially available D-dimer assays is provided. The second section reviews available evidence for the clinical utilization of D-dimer antigen measurement in VTE, as well as emerging areas of D-dimer utilization as a marker of coagulation activation in other clinical settings."

A shortcut to accurate diagnosis?,"D-dimer fragments can be measured easily in plasma and whole blood, and the presence or absence of D-dimer could be useful in the diagnostic evaluation of venous thromboembolism. We systematically reviewed the English literature for articles that compared D-dimer results with those of other tests for deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Twenty-nine studies were selected for detailed review, and we noted wide variability in assay performance, heterogeneity among subjects, and failure to define absence or presence of venous thromboembolism by a comprehensive criterion standard for diagnosis. These methodologic problems limit the generalizability of the published estimates of D-dimer accuracy for deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and the clinical utility of this potentially important test remains unproved."
CD010864,0,16243195,0,Use of spiral computed tomography contrast angiography and ultrasonography to exclude the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department.,"Spiral computed tomography (CT) contrast angiography is a promising imaging modality for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism but the negative predictive value of this test remains controversial. We performed a multi-center prospective cohort study to determine the safety of relying on a negative spiral CT contrast angiography scan to exclude pulmonary embolism. Patients presenting to the Emergency Departments of three tertiary care institutions with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism were potentially eligible for the study. Patients underwent a clinical evaluation to categorize pretest probability into low, moderate, and high categories, and had D-dimer testing performed. Patients at low pretest probability with normal D-dimer were considered to have pulmonary embolism excluded. The remaining patients underwent spiral CT contrast angiography scan of the pulmonary arterial circulation and bilateral venous ultrasound of the proximal leg veins. Patients who were confirmed to have pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis were treated with anticoagulant therapy. Patients in whom the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was excluded did not receive anticoagulant therapy and were followed for a 3-month period for the development of venous thromboembolic complications. Eight hundred fifty-eight (858) patients were enrolled in this study. Three-hundred sixty-nine (369) patients had low pretest probability and negative D-dimer results and no further diagnostic tests were performed. None of these patients subsequently developed venous thromboembolic complications (0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0% to 1.0%). The remaining 489 were referred for spiral CT contrast angiography scan and ultrasound. Sixty-seven patients were confirmed to have pulmonary embolism and an additional 15 patients with negative CT scans had proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on ultrasound for a total prevalence of venous thromboembolism of 82/489 (16.8%). Two of 409 patients who had pulmonary embolism excluded in the initial evaluation phase developed proximal venous thromboembolism (0.5%; 95% CI 0% to 1.8%) in the 3-month follow-up period. These findings suggest that the combination of a negative spiral CT contrast angiography scan and normal venous ultrasound imaging safely excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the Emergency Department setting."

CD010864,0,20936292,0,Re-elevation of D-dimer as a predictor of re-dissection and venous thromboembolism after Stanford type B acute aortic dissection.,"D-dimer measurement is a useful complementary initial diagnostic marker in patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD). However, it has not been clarified whether serial measurements of D-dimer are useful during in-hospital management of Stanford type B AAD. We studied 30 patients who were admitted with diagnosis of Stanford type B AAD and treated conservatively. D-dimer was serially measured on admission and then every 5 days during hospitalization. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of re-elevation of D-dimer during hospitalization, in which D-dimer transition were biphasic and latter peak >10.0 Î¼g/ml. Re-elevation of D-dimer was observed in 17 patients. There were no differences in atherosclerotic risk factors, blood pressure on admission, D-dimer level on admission, extent of AAD, and false lumen patency. Patients with re-elevation of D-dimer showed higher incidence of re-dissection and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE). Peak D-dimer level in patients with re-dissection and/or VTE was significantly higher than that without these complications (p = 0.005). In conclusion, serial measurements of D-dimer are useful for early detection of re-dissection or VTE in patients with Stanford type B AAD, which may contribute to the prevention of disastrous consequences such as pulmonary embolism and extension of AAD."

Patients were randomly allocated into two treatment groups: 44 patients received adapted doses of continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin (UH) whereas 47 received 1 mg/kg every twelve hours of a low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) subcutaneously. A phlebography and a perfusion lung scan were performed before inclusion and on day 10. Failure of therapy (n = 9) was defined by venogram worsening or confirmed pulmonary embolism. Improvement (n = 44) or stationary state (n = 38) were defined by venogram evolution in the absence of new leg scan defects. At presentation, D-Di, F 1+2 and TAT were above cut-off values in 97, 66 and 89% of patients respectively. D-Di levels correlated with the extent of venous thrombosis whereas TAT and F 1+2 did not. Mean levels of D-Di decreased sharply during the first days of treatment but were still abnormal on day 10. A secondary increase of D-Di on days 6 or 10 by more than 3 micrograms/ml occurred in 4 of the 9 patients who developed a thromboembolic recurrence but in none of the 72 patients who had a more favorable outcome. F 1+2 and TAT time-courses were not related to clinical evolution.

CD010864,0,23169888,0,Simultaneous detection of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis and Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii based on microsphere immunoreaction.,"Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis (Cmn) and Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii (Pss) are two plant pathogens that can cause tremendous agricultural economic losses. This novel method based on microsphere immunoreaction was developed for the simultaneous detection of Cmn and Pss in maize. This multiplex method was constructed based on microsphere immunodetection with fluorescent labels such as quantum dots (QDs) and R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) for the detection of Cmn and Pss. Captured QDs and R-PE serve as signal reporters for fluorescent readout. The principle of this method is based on a sandwich immunoreaction. Cmn and Pss captured by the microspheres were detected using flow cytometry. The limit of detection of this method was 10 times lower than the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and its analysis time (1 h) was much shorter compared with ELISA (6-8 h). The method, which has been proven to be an effective approach to multiplex detection of plant bacteria (Cmn and Pss as models), not only increased the varieties but also improved the sensitivity. The microsphere immunoreaction provides a universal method for the multiplex determination of microbes because of its high sensitivity, specificity, and speed. In the future, the method will be more fully validated in vivo to detect diversiform bacteria."
CD010864,0,17264947,0,Appropriateness of diagnostic strategies for evaluating suspected venous thromboembolism.,"It was the objective of this study to determine the proportion of patients who undergo an appropriate diagnostic work-up following a D-dimer test performed to evaluate suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We performed a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary care hospital. We included patients if they underwent D-dimer testing between 2002 and 2005, if the D-dimer was performed for evaluation of VTE, and if the D-dimer test was successful. We classified: the patients' clinical probability of DVT or PE according to the Wells models, the imaging results, and the appropriateness of the testing algorithm. Of 1,000 randomly selected patients, 863 met our study criteria. Seven hundred nineteen patients (83%) had testing during an emergency department visit, while 144 were tested as inpatients (17%). Physicians performed the D-dimer test to evaluate DVT and PE in 238 (28%) and 625 (72%) patients, respectively. Overall, the testing strategy was appropriate in 69% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66%-72%) of cases. The testing strategy was more likely to be appropriate for emergency department versus inpatients (75% vs. 39%, p < 0.05) and for DVT versus PE patients (84% vs. 63%, p < 0.05). Of all in-appropriately tested patients, under-utilization of diagnostic imaging was more common than over-utilization (90% vs. 10%, p < 0.05). VTE was confirmed in 37 of 138 'DVT patients' and 35 of 625 'PE patients' (16% [95% CI: 11%-21%] and 6% [95% CI: 4%-8%], respectively).

Groups of five rabbits were dosed orally on days 0, 7, and 14 with alginate microspheres prepared to contain no added protein, 5 mg of a potassium thiocyanate extract of P. multocida (PTE), or 5 mg of PTE with 200 micrograms of cholera toxin (CT). In addition, groups were dosed orally with 5 mg of soluble PTE with or without 200 micrograms CT, intranasally (IN) with 1 mg of soluble PTE, or with saline. Serum and nasal lavage samples collected prior to initial immunization and 10, 16, and 21 days later were assayed by ELISA for anti-PTE IgG and IgA. Strong nasal lavage IgA and serum IgG activities were found in samples from rabbits immunized with PTE IN or orally when incorporated into microspheres. Addition of CT did not significantly enhance either response. To examine the development of protective immunity, groups were similarly immunized and challenge-exposed IN on day 16 with 10(6) CFU of P. multocida. One week later, rabbits were euthanized, and specimens from the lungs, nasopharynx, liver, and inner ear were cultured for P. multocida. Less severe infections of the lung and nasopharynx developed in rabbits immunized with PTE IN or orally in microspheres, with or without added CT. In addition, culture of liver and tympanic bullae samples from these rabbits yielded growth of P. multocida less frequently compared to other P. multocida-challenged rabbits. Coadministration of CT and PTE did not significantly improve protective immunity to challenge."
CD010864,0,15634271,0,Quantitative high D-dimer value is predictive of pulmonary embolism occurrence independently of clinical score in a well-defined low risk factor population.,"We performed a prospective study to assess whether positive quantitative D-dimer (DD) levels could be integrated for a selected population in a defined strategy to accurately diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE). For this purpose, 1528 in- or outpatients with clinically suspected PE were investigated according to our prescription rules. Clinical probability was defined as low, intermediate or high. Patients in whom DD levels were measured met criteria defined by our previously described decision-making algorithm: in- and outpatients, < 80 years, without surgery in the previous 30 days or active cancer. Nine hundred and twenty-three patients (60.4%) had quantitative DD measurement using automated latex DD assay (STA-Liatest D-Di). According to our decision-making algorithm, DD measurement was applied to 70.5% of out-, and 55.7% of inpatients, and PE diagnosis was ruled out in 49.5% of the 923 patients. This allowed us to confirm prospectively that our specific rules greatly improve the DD testing efficiency. PE was diagnosed in 115 (12.5%) patients. For a 0.5 mg L(-1) cut-off, the test sensitivity was 97.4%, but its specificity was only 56.7%. However, PE prevalence increased gradually with DD levels. The true observed PE prevalence, according to the quantitative assessment of DD levels, differed from that predicted with pretest clinical probability only. Moreover, in this well-defined patient group, a quantitative DD level > 2 mg L(-1) was predictive of PE occurrence independently of the clinical score (odds ratio 6.9, 95% confidence interval 3.7, 12.8). As part of a defined strategy, knowledge of positive DD quantitative value, together with the clinical probability score, improves the PE predictive model. A clinical validation of these results in a follow-up study would now be necessary before considering the implementation of this strategy into clinical practice."
CD010864,0,18589050,0,Challenges in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.,"The state of the art of diagnostic evaluation of hemodynamically stable patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism was reviewed. Diagnostic evaluation should begin with clinical assessment using a validated prediction rule in combination with measurement of D-dimer when appropriate. Imaging should follow only when necessary. Although with 4-slice computed tomography (CT) and 16-slice CT, the sensitivity for detection of pulmonary embolism was increased by combining CT angiography with CT venography, it is not known whether CT venography increases the sensitivity of 64-slice CT angiography. Methods to reduce the radiation exposure of CT venography include imaging only the proximal leg veins (excluding the pelvis) and obtaining discontinuous images. Compression ultrasound can be used instead. In young women, radiation of the breasts produces the greatest risk of radiation-induced cancer. It may be that scintigraphy is the imaging test of choice in such patients, but this pathway should be tested prospectively. A patient-specific approach to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism can be taken safely in hemodynamically stable patients to increase efficiency and decrease cost and exposure to radiation."

CD010864,0,15158557,0,Humoral immune response of water buffalo monitored with three different antigens of Toxocara vitulorum.,"Humoral immune response of water buffalo naturally infected with Toxocara vitulorum was monitored using three different antigens of this parasite in serum and colostrum of buffalo cows and calves. Soluble extract (Ex) and excretory/secretory (ES) larval antigens and perienteric fluid antigen (Pe) of adult T. vitulorum were used to measure the antibody levels by an indirect ELISA. Serum of 7-12 buffalo cows for the first 365 days and colostrum of the same number of buffalo cows for the first 60 days of parturition, and serum of 8-10 buffalo calves for the first 365 days after birth were assayed. The ELISA detected antibodies against all three T. vitulorum antigens in the colostrum and serum of 100% of buffalo cows and calves examined. The highest antibody levels against Ex, ES and Pe antigens were detected in the buffalo cow sera during the perinatal period and were maintained at high levels through 300 days after parturition. On the other hand, colostrum antibody concentrations of all three antigens were highest on the first day post-parturition, but decreased sharply during the first 15 days. Concomitantly to the monitoring of immune response, the parasitic status of the calves was also evaluated. In calves, antibodies passively acquired were at the highest concentrations 24 h after birth and remained at high levels until 45 days coincidentally with the peak of T. vitulorum infection. The rejection of the worms by the calves occurred simultaneously with the decline of antibody levels, which reached their lowest levels between 76 and 150 days. Thereafter, probably because of the presence of adults/larvae stimulation, the calves acquired active immunity and the antibodies started to increase slightly in the serum and plateaued between the days 211 and 365. All three antigens were detected by the serum antibodies of buffalo calves; however, the concentration of anti-Pe antibody was higher than anti-EX and anti-ES, particularly after 90 days of age. By conclusion, the buffalo cows develop immunity and keep high levels of antibodies against T. vitulorum-Ex, ES and Pe antigens and these antibodies are transferred to their calves through the colostrum. This passively acquired immunity does not protect the calves against the acquisition of the infection, but these antibodies, passively or actively acquired, may have an important role during worm rejection by the calves and prevention of intestinal reinfection."

CD010864,0,11818461,0,Diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism.,"The diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) has been improved and simplified over the past decade thanks to advances in noninvasive and readily accessible technology. With high degrees of sensitivity and specificity, venous ultrasonography is favored as the initial investigation for DVT. To diagnose PE, most clinicians rely on diagnostic algorithms that combine clinical assessment, noninvasive lung studies, and, if necessary, venous ultrasonography of the legs and D-dimer testing. Substantial progress has also occurred in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism with the introduction of low-molecular-weight heparins. This class of antithrombotic agents has changed initial therapy from an inpatient, intravenous regimen that required laborious monitoring to an outpatient practice using weight-adjusted doses of once-daily subcutaneous injections. In addition, several new anticoagulants with theoretical advantages over existing agents have entered phase III studies. Aspects of thrombosis treatment that remain controversial include vena caval interruption and the indications for thrombolysis and surgical thromboembolectomy."

CD010864,0,10961580,0,D-dimer for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.,"D-dimer, a breakdown product of cross-linked fibrin has been extensively evaluated as a diagnostic test for acute venous thromboembolism. Rapid, highly sensitive D-dimer assays are now available that are suitable for testing in the emergency setting. Preliminary studies suggest that when using a highly sensitive D-dimer assay, a negative test result may,be sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism without need for further testing. Less sensitive, but more specific D-dimer assays are also available. The negative predictive value of these latter assays is insufficient to exclude venous thromboembolism on the basis of a negative test result alone. However, their utility is increased by identifying patient populations at low risk for venous thromboembolism using consideration of clinical probability or radiographic testing. Further, large multicenter management studies are required to confirm the safety of relying on a negative D-dimer result to exclude the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism."
CD010864,0,8782403,0,Modification of cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with dietary unsaturated fatty acids and regulation of arachidonate cascade reaction.,"Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were modified with dietary unsaturated fatty acids. The effects on the fatty acid composition in each phospholipid class and the formation of prostanoids upon stimulation were studied, from which the specificity of metabolism of individual unsaturated fatty acids and the regulation of arachidonate cascades in the modified cells were discussed. C18 unsaturated fatty acids were preferentially incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (PC) over phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), but arachidonic acid (20:4(n-6)) derived from gamma-linolenic acid (18:3(n-6)) was much more predominant in PE than PC. The fatty acid level in PE ranged from about 26-28% when the cells were modified with 20:4(n-6) or 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5(n-3)), indicating the limitation of the storage of the eicosapolyenoic acids. The extra amounts appeared to be stored in PC. 18:3(n-6) was comparable to 20:4(n-6) to raise the level of 20:4(n-6) in PE, but not in PC which had half of 20:4(n-6) in PE. The supplementation of linoleic acid (18:2(n-6)). 18:3(n-6), and 20:4(n-6) caused significant increases in the synthesis of prostaglandin (PG)E2 up to almost the same levels when the modified cells were stimulated with 50 nM PMA and 100 nM A23187 for 24h. The cultured cells modified with eicosapolyenoic acids including 20:3(n-6), 20:4(n-6), and 20:5(n-3) were found to be inhibitory for the induction of PGE2 synthetic activity involving de nova synthesis of PG endoperoxide synthase, suggesting negative feedback regulation of the modified cells."

CD010864,0,16019183,0,[The use of cardiac troponins (T or I) measurement in cardiology and various clinical settings].,"Measurement of cardiac troponin I or T in serum (highly specific for the myocardium) have replaced classical markers, such as creatine kinase MB. Cardiac troponins are preferred markers because of their high specificity and sensitivity. This had led to modifications of the original World Health Organization criteria for acute myocardial infarction. Furthermore, the place of the troponins as superior markers of subsequent cardiac risk in acute coronary syndrome has now become firmly established, for both diagnostic and risk stratification purposes. The use of C-reactive protein and/or other inflammatory biomarkers may add independent information in this context. After non cardiac surgery, the total cardiospecificity of cardiac troponins explains why other biomarkers of necrosis should no longer be used. Recent studies suggest that any elevation of troponin in the postoperative period is indicative of increased risk of long-term cardiac complications. This prognostic value has been previously demonstrated in other clinical settings such as invasive coronary intervention (surgical myocardial revascularization and percutaneous coronary intervention) and after heart valve surgery. Increases of troponin indicate cardiac damage, whatever the mechanism (ischemic or not). Other causes of cardiac injury include: pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, pericarditis, congestive heart failure, septic shock, myocardial contusion. In most cases, elevation of troponins has been shown to be associated with a bad outcome."
CD010864,0,9063056,0,The role of nuclear medicine in pulmonary embolism.,"Nuclear medicine procedures and mainly perfusion lung scanning (often associated with ventilation lung scanning), after thirty years still play a major role in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. International study groups with accurate statistical methods have shown their efficacy in the diagnosis and follow-up, in reducing the clinical uncertainty, in directing the therapy and in lowering health care costs. The major limitation of nuclear medicine procedures lies in the high percentage of patients for whom intermediate or indeterminate probability is reported. However this percentage is steadily decreasing based on: patient clinical preselection; improved procedures and especially an extensive use of D-SPET with a three-head gamma camera; the combination with other advanced diagnostic imaging procedures (HRCT, fast-CT, MRI); suitable diagnostic algorithms for nuclear medicine procedures which should consider laboratory data (D-dimer, TAT) and the study of deep vein thrombosis; the use of artificial intelligence; the introduction of radiopharmaceuticals which enable direct scanning of the intravasal embolus (as P180 polypeptide) in combination with perfusion scanning which shows the hemodynamic alterations."
CD010864,0,9063054,0,Clinical and instrumental diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism shows a high mortality especially for the difficulty in establishing an early correct diagnosis. The pathophysiology and thus the clinical manifestations of pulmonary embolism (PE) are essentially conditioned by three factors: the size of the embolus, the pre-existing cardiorespiratory condition, the release caused by the embolus, of some substances or the activation of reflexes which tend to worsen the purely mechanical consequences of PE. The clinical manifestations resulting from the combination of these factors result in three clinical patterns: acute cor pulmonare, pulmonary infarction, acute dyspnea. PE symptoms may be absent in a moderate percentage of cases and if present, they are nonspecific. Some laboratory tests were shown to be of no diagnostic accuracy, as enzyme determination, a sign of necrosis, blood gas analysis, and determination of alveolar arterial oxygen gradient. Among blood coagulation tests, D-dimer determination was shown to be of some relevance. However, at present, it cannot be used to confirm the diagnostic suspicion of PE. Among the instrumental cardiologic procedures, while ECG has a poor diagnostic reliability, transesophageal echocardiography in central embolism may be able to visualize the embolus and to accurately assess the hemodynamic effects, supplying sufficient information for PE therapy. Even if imaging procedures as pulmonary angiography and more recently CT or MRI are the most reliable diagnostic tools, the diagnostic suspicion of PE in subjects at risk, the use of the examined methods and the search in these patients for the presence of lower limb deep vein thrombosis, often asymptomatic, may increase the number of treated patients thus decreasing the mortality of this disease."
CD010864,0,9241751,0,Effects of heparin therapy on fibrinolysis in patients with pulmonary embolism.,"Previous investigations suggested that heparin administration to humans enhances the tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) levels in blood, but it remains uncertain whether this effect induces fibrinolysis. We studied the effect of therapeutic levels of heparinization on plasma markers for fibrinolysis in patients suspected of pulmonary embolism (PE). Blood samples were taken from 49 consecutive patients; 28 had confirmed PE, 21 had PE excluded. On admission, the plasma levels of plasmin-alpha 2antiplasmin complexes and D-dimer were significantly higher in the patient group with PE compared to those in whom PE was excluded. After heparinization the tPA levels increased in both groups, showing that this effect was not dependent on the initial level of activity of fibrinolysis. In spite of this increment in tPA levels, the concentrations of plasmin-alpha 2antiplasmin complexes and D-dimer decreased. In conclusion, although heparinization in patients with or without pulmonary embolism does lead to elevated tPA:Ag levels, this is not accompanied by enhanced fibrinolysis."

CD010864,0,11818319,0,Embolus location affects the sensitivity of a rapid quantitative D-dimer assay in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"D-dimer blood tests have been suggested to rule out pulmonary embolism. Despite evidence of the safety of withholding anticoagulant treatment in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and a normal D-dimer assay result, clinicians remain reluctant to use a D-dimer assay as a sole diagnostic test. This prospective study in 314 consecutive inpatients and outpatients investigates the relation between the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer plasma concentration and pulmonary embolus location. Plasma D-dimer levels were measured using a quantitative immunoturbidimetric method. A strict protocol of ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, pulmonary angiography, and spiral computed tomography was used to arrive at a final diagnosis and to assess the largest pulmonary artery in which embolus was visible. The influence of embolus location on the diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. There was a strong correlation between plasma D-dimer concentration and embolus location (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.001). Thus, the assay showed greater accuracy in excluding segmental or larger emboli (sensitivity = 93%) than subsegmental emboli (sensitivity = 50%). D-dimer concentration and the accuracy of D-dimer assays are clearly dependent on embolus location and smaller, subsegmental emboli may be missed when D-dimer assays are used as a sole test to exclude pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,23470078,0,High sensitivity troponin in cardiovascular disease. Is there more than a marker of myocardial death?,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and coronary artery disease is its most prevalent manifestation, associated with high mortality and morbidity. In clinical practice cardiac troponins (cTn) are the cornerstone of the diagnosis, risk stratification and thus selection of the optimal treatment strategy in patients with acute coronary syndrome. According to the third update of the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI) cTn is the preferred cardiac biomarker of myocardial necrosis in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia. Over the last years newer high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays have been developed that are more sensitive than conventional assays, have low limit of detection, low imprecision and low reference limits, but due to variability, the deployment of a standardization and harmonization method is required before their wide use in clinical practice. Recent studies have shown that their utilization seems to improve the diagnostic accuracy detecting MI in patients presenting with chest pain. However, the improved sensitivity comes along with a decreased specificity, though serial cTn measurements and the detection of early changes could improve the specificity and the overall diagnostic performance. Moreover, apart from their use in the diagnosis and risk stratification of MI and acute coronary syndromes, hs-cTn assays seem to have a key role in risk stratification and short and long-term prognosis in a variety of cardiovascular modalities such as stable coronary disease, heart failure and acute pulmonary embolism. In addition, studies have suggested that cTns may be used as a biomarker in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease leading to the identification of high-risk populations or individuals with silent heart disease."

There are many different etiopathogenetic theories that have been proposed. One theory is based on immunologic factors that may be regulated by hormones. The primary objective of the present study was to review the main hormones that may be involved in the PE pathophysiology. The current literature has suggested the involvement of many different hormonal systems in the pathogenesis of PE such as cortisol, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, arginine vasopressin, epinephrine and norepinephrine, natriuretic atrial peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and melatonin. These findings suggest the complexity of the pathophysiology of PE, which involves many different hormonal systems.

To gain insight into this problem, monocytes were isolated from pulmonary arterial blood in patients suffering from PH, related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 6), chronic pulmonary thromboembolism (n = 3) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (n = 8). The severity of PH was associated with decreases in cardiac index (CI) and mixed venous blood oxygen saturation (SO(2)), and an increase in right atrial pressure (). Monocyte pro-MMP-9 content (zymography) was positively correlated with SO(2) (r = 0.73, P < 0.05) and CI (r = 0.66, P < 0.05), and negatively with (r = 0.54, P < 0.05); there was no significant correlation with pulmonary vascular resistance. In conclusion, the pro-MMP-9 content of circulating monocytes was lower in the more severe forms of PH which showed heart failure suggesting that such MMP enzymatic activity reflects heart failure following pulmonary vascular and myocardial remodelling in PH."

We studied 130 healthy pregnant (HP), 130 pregnant with GH, and 133 pregnant with PE. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and genotypes for g.-1306C>T and g.-735C>T polymorphisms were determined by Real Time-PCR, using Taqman allele discrimination assays. Haplotypes were inferred using the PHASE program. Plasma MMP-2 and TIMP-2 concentrations were measured by ELISA. The main findings were that pregnant with PE have higher plasma MMP-2 and TIMP-2 concentrations than HP (P<0.05), although the MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratios were similar (P>0.05). Moreover, pregnant with GH have elevated plasma MMP-2 levels and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratios compared to HP (P<0.05). While MMP-2 genotypes and haplotypes are not linked with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, MMP-2 genotypes and haplotypes are associated with significant alterations in plasma MMP-2 and TIMP-2 concentrations in preeclampsia (P<0.05). Our findings may help to understand the relevance of MMP-2 and its genetic polymorphisms to the pathophysiology of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. It is possible that patients with PE and the MMP-2 haplotype combining the C and T alleles for the g.-1306C>T and g.-735C>T polymorphisms may benefit from the use of MMPs inhibitors such as doxycycline. However, this possibility remains to be determined."
CD010864,0,12825308,0,[Pulmonary embolism after placement of an Esmarch bandage for ankle surgery].,"We report the case of a woman scheduled for surgical fixation of an ankle fracture who developed a pulmonary embolism during application of an Esmarch compression bandage for exsanguination of the limb. Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were needed to reanimate the patient and surgery had to be postponed 15 days. Orthopedic surgery, pneumatic tourniquets for providing a bloodless field and other risk factors contribute to the development of pulmonary embolism, which is often fatal. Accurate diagnosis by plasma D-dimer determination and imaging (perfusion scintigraphy, vascular Doppler ultrasound, echocardiography and pulmonary angiography) is discussed, along with therapeutic approaches to consider when managing pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,15684354,0,Screening for pulmonary embolism with a D-dimer assay: do we still need to assess clinical probability as well?,"Clinical risk stratification and D-dimer assay can be of use in excluding pulmonary embolism in patients presenting to emergency departments but many D-dimer assays exist and their accuracy varies. We used clinical risk stratification combined with a quantitative latex-agglutination D-dimer assay to screen patients before arranging further imaging if required. Retrospective analysis of a sequential series of 376 patients revealed that no patient with a D-dimer of <275 ng/mL was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, irrespective of clinical probability. We conclude that a latex-agglutination assay could be used to exclude pulmonary embolism without the necessity for clinical risk stratification. If these findings are borne out by further work, D-dimer strategies to exclude pulmonary embolism could substantially reduce imaging workload."
CD010864,0,17938799,0,Prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in non-surgical patients at hospital admission.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is known as a common complication in surgical and non-surgical patients. We hypothesized that according to the underlying risk factors and the acute illness, the prevalence ofVTE in non-surgical patients admitted to hospital is widely underestimated. For three months each patient admitted to the department of internal medicine with an acute illness, but without known deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was investigated by ultrasound compression sonography. Patients' history, risk factors and extent of immobilisation were documented. In patients with newly detected DVT D-dimer and fibrinogen were measured as well as computer tomography scans performed. Follow-up investigations of the DVT population were performed at four weeks and three months. Six hundred seventeen patients (49.3% men) were included. In 16 patients (men = 7) a previously unknown thrombosis (2.6%) was detected, mainly in patients with acute cardio-pulmonary disease (56%) and the elderly (mean age 75.6 years). Eight patients had femoro-popliteal (50.0%), four a femoral (25.0%), and four a popliteal vein thrombosis (25.0%). Five had pulmonary embolism (31.3%). In patients with DVT D-dimer was 875 +/- 1,228 mg/l, fibrinogen 568 +/- 215 mg/dl and C-reactive-protein 58.54 +/- 73.65 mg/dl. One patient died from sepsis during hospitalisation, one died from sudden cardiac death at home. None of the other 14 surviving patients relapsed. The study shows a 2.6% risk for DVT in outpatients with acute illness admitted to the department of internal medicine. These data demonstrate the high risk of DVT is in non-surgical patients. Early prophylaxis has to be considered in internal medicine patients especially in the elderly."
CD010864,0,21352402,0,Effect of two different FDA-approved D-dimer assays on resource utilization in the emergency department.,"The D-dimer assay has been shown to be an appropriate test to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) in low-risk patients in the emergency department (ED).

CD010864,0,21374070,0,Weight and inflammation are the major determinants of vascular dysfunction in the aortae of db/db mice.,"The key roles that obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress play in the progression of diabetes vascular complications are well recognized; however, the relative contribution and importance of these individual factors remain uncertain. At 6, 10, or 14 weeks old, blood samples and thoracic aortae were collected from db/db mice and their non-diabetic controls. Plasma samples were analyzed for glucose, 8-isoprostane, CRP, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL as markers of glycemic status, oxidative stress, inflammation, and dyslipidemia, respectively. The responses of the aortic rings to high KCl, phenylephrine (PE), acetylcholine (ACh), and sodium nitroprusside were examined. Statistical methods were used to estimate the strength of the association between plasma variables and vascular functions. Systemic inflammation occurred in db/db mice at an earlier age than did hyperglycemia or oxidative stress. Aortae of db/db showed augmented contractions to PE which were positively correlated with weight, plasma glucose, 8-isoprostane, and CRP. Also, db/db mice showed impaired endothelium-dependent ACh vasorelaxation which was negatively correlated with weight, plasma glucose, and 8-isoprostane. Multivariate analysis and stepwise modeling show that CRP is the major determinant of the contractile responses, while weight and HDL are the major determinants of ACh-induced relaxation. Among the traditional risk factors of obesity, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and dyslipidemia, our study reveals that weight and inflammation are the major determinants of vascular dysfunction in the aortae of db/db mice. Our findings partially resolve the complexity of diabetes vasculopathies and suggest targeting weight loss and inflammation for effective therapeutic approaches."
CD010864,0,21833454,0,Cardiac troponin testing and the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index. The SWIss Venous ThromboEmbolism Registry (SWIVTER).,"A low simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI), defined as age â¤80 years and absence of systemic hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, cancer, heart failure, and lung disease, identifies low-risk patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). It is unknown whether cardiac troponin testing improves the prediction of clinical outcomes if the sPESI is not low. In the prospective Swiss Venous Thromboembolism Registry, 369 patients with acute PE and a troponin test (conventional troponin T or I, highly sensitive troponin T) were enrolled from 18 hospitals. A positive test result was defined as a troponin level above the manufacturers assay threshold. Among the 106 (29%) patients with low sPESI, the rate of mortality or PE recurrence at 30 days was 1.0%. Among the 263 (71%) patients with high sPESI, 177 (67%) were troponin-negative and 86 (33%) troponin-positive; the rate of mortality or PE recurrence at 30 days was 4.6% vs. 12.8% (p=0.015), respectively. Overall, risk assessment with a troponin test (hazard ratio [HR] 3.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-8.37; p=0.008) maintained its prognostic value for mortality or PE recurrence when adjusted for sPESI (HR 5.80, 95%CI 0.76-44.10; p=0.09). The combination of sPESI with a troponin test resulted in a greater area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.81) than sPESI alone (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57-0.68) (p=0.023). In conclusion, although cardiac troponin testing may not be required in patients with a low sPESI, it adds prognostic value for early death and recurrence for patients with a high sPESI."
CD010864,0,8170264,0,The antiphospholipid and thrombosis syndromes.,"Anticardiolipin antibodies and the lupus anticoagulant are strongly associated with thrombosis and appear to be the most common of the acquired blood protein defects causing thrombosis. Although the precise mechanism(s) whereby antiphospholipid antibodies alter hemostasis to induce a hypercoagulable state remain unclear, several theories have been advanced. The commonest thrombotic events associated with anticardiolipin antibodies are deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus (type I syndrome), coronary or peripheral artery thrombosis (type II syndrome), or cerebrovascular/retinal vessel thrombosis (type III syndrome), and occasionally patients present with mixtures (type IV syndrome). The relative frequency of anticardiolipin antibodies in association with arterial and venous thrombosis strongly suggests that these should be looked for in any individual with unexplained thrombosis; all three idiotypes (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be assessed. Also, the type of syndrome (I through IV) should be defined if possible because this may dictate both type and duration of immediate and long-term anticoagulant therapy. In contrast to those with anticardiolipin antibodies, patients with primary lupus anticoagulant thrombosis syndrome usually suffer venous thrombosis. Because the aPTT is unreliable in patients with lupus anticoagulant (prolonged in only about 40% to 50% of patients) and is not usually prolonged in patients with anticardiolipin antibodies, definitive tests (ELISA for anticardiolipin antibody and the dRVVT for lupus anticoagulant) should be immediately ordered when suspecting antiphospholipid syndrome or in individuals with otherwise unexplained thrombotic or thromboembolic events."
CD010864,0,1921237,0,Fibrin degradation product D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"The study objective was to determine the specificity and sensitivity of plasma concentrations of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product, as a marker for ongoing thrombotic and thrombolytic events in pulmonary embolism. A prospective study was performed in 74 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism who appeared in the emergency room with dyspnea and/or chest pain. The presence of pulmonary embolism was established by positive findings either in pulmonary angiography or lung scan. D-dimer concentrations were determined in all patients. In 11 patients with positive pulmonary angiography, D-dimer concentrations were monitored for 6-12 days. D-dimer concentrations were determined by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay. Plasma probes of 26 patients (16 with/10 without positive pulmonary angiography) were re-assayed with a semiquantitative latex agglutination assay. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with pulmonary embolism (greater than 1000 ng/mL in 41 out of 43) than in those without (less than 1000 ng/mL in all 21 patients) (p less than 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity for the ELISA were found to be 95% and 100%, respectively, for establishing the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. In the latex assay the values were 81% and 60%, respectively. It is concluded that in patients with dyspnea and/or chest pain, determination of D-dimer in plasma by ELISA adds a valuable tool to the noninvasive diagnostic procedure for pulmonary embolism. From the time-course of D-dimer values we conclude that this assay might be valuable up to at least 6 days after symptom onset. The assay, however, is unreliable in malignancies or after surgery."
CD010864,0,23241942,0,Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in a patient affected by uterine fibroids: clinical case.,"A 51 year old woman was admitted for night dyspneic attacks and fainting. When hospitalised the patient reported in the previous 10 days dry cough, edema and pain (left leg). The woman's medical history did not show any risk factors for vein thromboembolism, d-dimer dosage appeared increased and arterial blood gas showed hypoxemia and hypocapnia. ECG and chest X-Rays were within normal limits; a chest CT diagnosed pulmonary embolism that was treated with thrombolytic therapy. Venous lower extremity ultrasound detected ilio-femoral and popliteal venous thrombosis and an abdominal CT showed a swollen and fibromatous uterus, obstructing the left iliac vein system. Thrombolytic therapy was effective to for pulmonary embolism and to begin recanalization of the iliac, femoral, and popliteal veins. The patients was sent home in good clinical conditions, with anticoagulant therapy; later the uterine fibroma was treated with hysterectomy."
CD010864,0,18468832,0,Pulmonary embolism despite negative ELISA D-dimer: a case report.,"Pulmonary embolus (PE) can be fatal, but is often treatable if recognized early. Unfortunately, the clinical presentation of PE is often variable and misleading. The D-dimer assay has recently come into favor as a method to exclude PE; however, this test has an acceptable safety margin only in low-risk populations. What is unclear is the exact composition of this low risk population. This is the report of a 26-year-old woman with over 2 weeks of chest pain and intermittent dyspnea. The patient was initially seen in the Emergency Department (ED) and hospitalized. She returned to the ED 2 weeks later with similar symptoms. Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) D-dimer assays were normal on the initial and subsequent ED visits, pulmonary embolism (PE) was diagnosed by computed tomography scan on the second visit. This report highlights the risk of misdiagnosing PE if relying solely on ELISA D-dimer for exclusion. The approach to PE should include a measure of clinical probability. This report documents the presentation of PE despite having two unremarkable ELISA D-dimer measurements, and highlights the importance of clinical suspicion."
CD010864,0,21131039,0,Risk assessment for recurrent venous thrombosis.,"Venous thrombosis is a common disease that frequently recurs. Recurrence can be prevented by anticoagulants, albeit at the cost of bleeding. Thus, assessment of the risk of recurrence is important to balance the risks and benefits of anticoagulation treatment. Many clinical and laboratory risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis have been established. Nevertheless, prediction of recurrence in an individual patient remains a challenge. Detection of some laboratory markers is associated with only a moderate risk of recurrence, and the relevance of others is not known. Many patients have several risk factors and the effect of combined defects is obscure. Routine screening for these laboratory markers should therefore be abandoned. Risk assessment can be improved by measurement of global markers that encompass the effects of clotting and fibrinolytic disorders. Analysis of preliminary data suggests that risk assessment can also be refined through integration of prothrombotic coagulation changes and clinical risk factors."

CD010864,0,16302160,0,D-dimer testing in ischemic stroke and cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis.,"D-dimer measurement is commonly included in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected acute symptomatic deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. As a haemostatic marker, it could be theoretically useful in other thromboembolic disorders, such as acute cerebrovascular events. In this review we summarize published literature on D-dimer testing in acute ischemic stroke and cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis (CSVT), discussing possible clinical diagnostic and therapeutical applications. In ischemic stroke, mounting evidence suggests a possible role of D-dimer in the acute diagnosis of ischemic stroke subtypes, especially in identifying tromboembolic and lacunar stroke. Its prognostic role still remains unclear, due to conflicting data. D-dimer could be also an useful screening test for excluding CSVT in patients presenting with acute headache, making the presence of cerebral thrombosis unlikely with low plasma levels. In this clinical setting sensitivity and negative predictive value are comparable to that reported in the diagnosis of acute thromboembolic disease. However, more studies are needed to confirm these recent findings as well as management studies to correctly introduce D-dimer measurement in clinical daily practice of ischemic stroke and CSVT."
CD010864,0,22496322,0,Is it time for home treatment of pulmonary embolism?,"Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a frequent cause of death, but not all patients are at high risk of an adverse early outcome. It has been proposed that selected patients may be considered for early discharge and home treatment, but it was only recently that improved risk assessment strategies permitted advances in the identification of low-risk PE. Clinical prediction rules, such as the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI), and laboratory biomarkers, particularly natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins, appeared capable of excluding severe PE and serious comorbidity. Recently, two randomised trials and two prospective cohort studies investigated the feasibility and safety of outpatient treatment. All excluded patients with haemodynamic instability and serious comorbidity, but only one trial used a validated clinical score (PESI) for patient inclusion, and only one cohort study employed a biomarker test. Overall, 90-day outcome was favourable and the results appear promising. To optimise patient selection, future trials will need to test simplified clinical scores combined with high-sensitivity biomarker assays, and it will have to be determined whether echocardiography and/or compression ultrasonography are also required before discharge. Furthermore, ongoing trials will show whether new oral anticoagulants are a safe and cost-effective option for managing patients out of hospital."

CD010864,0,16820203,0,Differential release of plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs) during dual perfusion of human placenta: implications in preeclampsia.,"Plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs) play critical roles in regulating cellular invasion and fibrinolysis. An increase in the ratio of PAI-1/PAI-2 in placenta and maternal serum is suggested to result in excessive intervillous fibrin deposition and placental infarction in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In the current study we used dual (maternal and fetal) perfusion of human term placentas to examine the release of PAIs to the intervillous space. ELISA revealed a significant time-dependent increase in total PAI-1 levels in maternal perfusate (MP) between 1 and 7h of perfusion. Conversely, PAI-2 levels decreased resulting in a 3-fold increase in the PAI-1/PAI-2 ratio in MP. Levels of PAI-1, but not PAI-2, in placental tissue extracts increased during perfusion. In perfusions carried out with xanthine and xanthine oxidase (X + XO), compounds used to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), no time-dependent increase in total PAI-1 levels was observed. In addition, X + XO treatment promoted a 3-fold reduction in active PAI-1 levels in MP, indicating that ROS decrease PAI-1 release to MP. The finding of a time-dependent change in patterns of PAI expression and response to ROS indicates the utility of dual perfusion as a model to dissect mechanism(s) promoting aberrant fibrinolysis in pregnancies complicated by PE and IUGR."

CD010864,0,20644564,0,Acute pulmonary embolism. Part 1: epidemiology and diagnosis.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a frequently occurring, acute, and potentially fatal condition. Numerous risk factors for PE, both inherited and acquired, have been identified. Adequate diagnosis is mandatory to prevent PE-related morbidity and mortality on the one hand, and unnecessary treatment on the other. Only around 1 in 5 individuals with suspected PE will have the diagnosis confirmed, therefore, the diagnostic work-up for PE should comprise safe, efficient, and noninvasive methods. The first step in the approach to diagnosis of patients with suspected PE is to determine the clinical probability and to perform a D-dimer test. PE can be excluded in patients with a 'low', 'intermediate' or 'unlikely' clinical probability and a normal D-dimer test. Additional imaging is required for those with a 'high' or 'likely' clinical probability or a positive D-dimer test. CT pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, followed by additional testing is the next step when test results are nondiagnostic. Although various diagnostic strategies have been introduced and validated, selected patients may require a tailored approach."
CD010864,0,18840644,0,Vascular supply as a discriminating factor for pig preantral follicle selection.,"This research analyses how somatic and vascular compartments change during preantral follicle growth. To address this aim, theca-granulosa (somatic) proliferation indexes (PIs), proportion of proliferating endothelial cells (PE), vascular area (VA) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression were simultaneously recorded on single healthy preantral follicles, classified into six different stages on the basis of the diameter and the granulosa layers. An autonomous blood vessel network starts to appear only in class 3. Vascular remodelling requires VEGFA expression, and VEGFA mRNA and VA significantly increase between class 3 and classes 4 and 5 and, further, in class 6. In addition, a positive correlation exists between these parameters in classes 3-5. Despite variation in angiogenesis results from classes 3 to 5, the statistical analysis reveals that the vascular parameters are positively and strictly correlated with somatic PIs. Conversely, class 6, also characterized by higher values of somatic PIs, displays a stable proportion of PEs ( congruent with 40%) without showing any correlation among the different parameters analysed. To identify follicular subpopulations within different classes, a multivariate hierarchical cluster analysis was performed. This analysis reveals that the majority of classes 3 and 4 are quiescent follicles or structures that grow very slowly. Class 5 represents a transitory category, where half of the follicles maintain a low activity and the remaining express significantly higher levels of granulosa PI and VA. The follicles with this high activity are probably able to reach class 6 becoming dominant structures where somatic and vascular parameters are constantly on high levels and the VA remains the unique differentiating element."

We identified pivotal signaling pathways associated with the efficacy of crude phenolic extracts (PEs) obtained from 14 monovarietals of Spanish EVOOs. i) MTT-based cell viability and HPLC coupled to time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry assays revealed that anti-cancer activity of EVOO PEs positively correlated with the phenolic index (i.e., total content of phenolics) and with a higher presence of the complex polyphenols secoiridoids instead of lignans. ii) Genome-wide analyses using 44 K Agilent's whole human arrays followed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)-based screening of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database revealed a differential modulation of the JIMT-1 transcriptome at the level of the cell cycle and p53 pathways. EVOO PEs differentially impacted the expression status of stress-sensing, G2-M check-point-related GADD45 genes and of p53-related CDKN1A, CDKN1C and PMAIP-1 genes. iii) Cell cycle and fluorescence microscopy analyses confirmed that secoiridoid-rich EVOO PE inhibited mitosis to promote G2-M cell cycle arrest. This was accompanied with the appearance of diffuse, even DNA staining with Î³H2AX and pan-nuclear hyperacetylation of Histone H3 at Lysine 18. iv) Semi-quantitative Signaling Node Multi-Target ELISAs determined that secoiridoid-rich EVOO PE drastically activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases MEK1 and p38 MAPK, a GADD45-related kinase involved in Histone H3 acetylation. Secoiridoids, a family of complex polyphenols characteristic of Oleaceae plants, appear to permit histones to remain in hyperacetylated states and through the resulting alterations in gene regulation to reduce mitotic viability and metabolic competence of breast cancer cells inherently refractory to HER-targeting therapies ab initio. Oleaceae secoiridoids could provide a valuable phytochemical platform for the design of more pharmacologically active second-generation phytopharmaceutical anti-breast cancer molecules with a unique mode of action."
CD010864,0,10625209,0,Detection of decreased response to activated protein C during pregnancy by an endogenous thrombin potential-based assay.,"Pregnancy has been widely recognized as a predisposing risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, it still remains unclear why pregnant women without a history of familial thrombophilia or antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) have a higher incidence of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) during pregnancy and puerperium. We examined the activated protein C (APC) system in healthy pregnant women and in patients with the onset of DVT during puerperium. Sixty unselected Japanese pregnant women without a past or family history of thrombosis or APS and 3 Japanese women with DVT during puerperium were evaluated. Endogenous thrombin potential-ratio (ETP-r) was measured by determination of thrombin-alpha2-macroglobulin complexes in thromboplastin-activated patient plasma. APC sensitivity ratio (APC-sr) was calculated by the determination of ETP-r in patient plasma in the presence and absence of APC (final concentration [conc.] 5.9 nM) to evaluate the functional APC anticoagulant activity. Mean APC-sr was significantly increased at 30 weeks' gestation (2.35 +/- 0.72) and remained high during puerperium compared with the mean APC-sr in nonpregnant women (1.15 +/- 0.63). Mean APC-sr in patients with DVT at the onset was significantly higher (3.57 +/- 0.54) than mean APC-sr during puerperium was, indicating that the sensitivity to APC was reduced in the ETP-based assay. These data suggest a significant reduction in the functional sensitivity to APC associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis during pregnancy."
CD010864,0,23182714,0,Role of complement in a murine model of peanut-induced anaphylaxis.,"Peanut allergy is severe and persisting from childhood to adulthood. However, there is no effective prophylaxis or treatment for peanut allergy. Little is known to about the molecular process in the pathogenesis of peanuts allergy, especially in innate immunity. Thus we investigated the role of complement activation in murine peanut anaphylaxis. Complement component C3 deposition on peanut extract (PE) was evaluated using sera from wild-type (WT), mannose-binding lectin associated serine protease (MASP)-1/3 deficient, MASP-2 deficient, and C4 deficient mice. Sera from interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4) deficient mice, which lack serum immunoglobulin, were also used. In anaphylaxis study, mice were pretreated with propranolol and a long-acting form of IL-4, and injected with PE. Mice were then assessed for plasma C3a levels and hypothermia shock by ELISA and rectal temperature measurement, respectively. C3 deposition on PE was abolished in immunoglobulin- and C4-deficient sera. No difference in C3 deposition levels were observed among WT, MASP-1/3 deficient and MASP-2 deficient sera. IgM, IgG2b, IgG3, C1q, and ficolin-A deposits were detected on PE. In anaphylaxis study, MASP-1/3 deficient mice showed elevation of plasma C3a levels similar to WT mice. However, they were significantly reduced in C4- and MASP-2-deficient mice compared to WT mice. Consistently, PE-induced anaphylactic shock was prevented in C4 deficient mice and partially in MASP-2 deficient mice. In conclusion, PE activates complement via both the lectin and classical pathways in vivo, and the complement activation contributes to hypothermia shock in mice."
CD010864,0,9844515,0,[Deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women].,"The main risk factors for deep vein thrombosis in pregnancy and after delivery are preeclampsia, operative delivery, adiposity, prolonged bed rest, and haemostatic defects (antithrombin, protein C and protein S deficiencies), activated protein C resistance, lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid antibodies. Hyperhomocystinaemia is a general risk factor for deep vein thrombosis. The clinical diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is difficult and must be confirmed by imaging techniques. Positive D-dimer has high sensitivity, but low specificity to detect acute thrombosis. Standard treatment is unfractionated heparin intravenously for 7-10 days, followed by subcutaneous injections. Anticoagulant treatment is prolonged for 6-12 weeks after delivery, usually with warfarin. During pregnancies associated with high risk of thrombosis, low molecular heparin prophylaxis is given during pregnancy and 6-12 weeks after delivery. Thrombosis in pregnancy must be followed by adequate investigation for an underlying thrombotic predisposition."
CD010864,0,21808129,0,Optimal duration of anticoagulation in patients with venous thromboembolism.,"The risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) approaches 40 per cent of all patients after 10 yr of follow up. This risk is higher in patients with permanent risk factors of thrombosis such as active cancer, prolonged immobilization from medical diseases, and antiphospholipid syndrome; in carriers of several thrombophilic abnormalities, including deficiencies of natural anticoagulants; and in patients with unprovoked presentation. Patients with permanent risk factors of thrombosis should receive indefinite anticoagulation, consisting of subtherapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin in cancer patients, and oral anticoagulants in all other conditions. Patients whose VTE is triggered by major surgery or trauma should be offered three months of anticoagulation. Patients with unprovoked VTE, including carriers of thrombophilia, and those whose thrombotic event is associated with minor risk factors (such as hormonal treatment, minor injuries, long travel) should receive at least three months of anticoagulation. The decision as to go on or discontinue anticoagulation after this period should be individually tailored and balanced against the haemorrhagic risk. Post-baseline variables, such as the D-dimer determination and the ultrasound assessment of residual thrombosis can help identify those patients in whom anticoagulation can be safely discontinued. As a few emerging anti-Xa and anti-IIa compounds seem to induce fewer haemorrhagic complications than conventional anticoagulation, while preserving at least the same effectiveness, these have the potential to open new scenarios for decisions regarding the duration of anticoagulation in patients with VTE."

However, because of the test's subjectivity, misinterpretation of the result is possible when performed by inexperienced staff. Recent reports by other investigators indicated a low sensitivity of this assay for VTE and noted a reduction in sensitivity (84%) for pulmonary embolism."

CD010864,0,7745259,0,[Coagulation disorders after endoscopic resection of the prostate].,"Endoscopic resection of the prostate is a well defined surgical procedure. Nevertheless, certain coagulation disorders (hypercoagulability with risk of deep vein thrombosis, haemorrhage) can raise special problems. In patients not given heparin prophylaxis, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis is 10% in transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP). The risk is higher for cancer. Among the diagnostic tools (D-dimer assay, continuous Doppler, pulsed echo-Doppler, thermography, plethysmography, ...) ascending phlebography or pulmonary angiography in case of suspected pulmonary emboli remains the gold standard. Haemorrhage is rarely related to defribination but frequently to dilution coagulopathy favoured by high blood pressure, resorption of irrigation fluid, deficient haemostasis with loss of coagulation factors or massive transfusions. Only clinically patent coagulation disorders leading to haemorrhage should be treated. For dilution coagulopathies and diffuse intravascular coagulation, treatment is based on viro-inactive fresh plasma infusion. Aprotinine is the first choice in case of fibrinolysis."

CD010864,0,11697706,0,Thrombophilia and pregnancy: review of the literature and some original data.,"The association of thrombophilia with pregnancy complications has received increasing attention. It is now apparent that thrombophilia is responsible for a large number of the serious complications of pregnancy such as venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, fetal loss, pregnancy loss, intrauterine fetal demise, and preeclampsia. The inherited thrombophilia abnormalities, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation 20210A, and antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S deficiency, and the acquired disorders, the anticardiolipin syndrome and lupus inhibitor, are responsible for a large share of the incidences of premature termination of pregnancy and many of the above complications. The normal physiology of pregnancy may be prothrombotic, with evidence for increased markers of activated coagulation and coagulation factors. There is a decrease in protein S and resistance to activated protein C occurs in a significant number of pregnancies in the absence of the factor V Leiden mutation. In the following article, we review some of the major studies that have correlated the thrombophilia and other acquired disorders that adversely impact pregnancies."
CD010864,0,2803738,0,[Simultaneous analysis of lymphocyte markers using triple color markers].,"The introduction in flow cytometry of the new reagent Streptavidin Duochrome allows the simultaneous three color analysis of biological samples. Streptavidin Duochrome is a phycoerythrin-Texas red fluorochrome complex conjugated to the protein streptavidin. This novel complex exploits the principle fluorescence energy transfer when this reagent is used with FITC, PE and biotin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies; three different emissions of fluorescence are possible simultaneously using an argon laser at 488 nm (FACScan Becton Dickinson). Using Paint-a-gate software which analyses samples and displays the three colors on a screen, antigen distribution on multiple cell populations is obtained. Single, double and triple labeled cells (up to seven combinations) are visualized and quantified quickly and easily. Using a panel of normal donors we have evaluated the following combinations: CD3/CD4/CD8 to visualize T lymphocytes and their subsets; CD3/CD19/CD16 to quantify quickly the T, B, NK populations; CD4/Leu8/Leu18 to analyse the helper subset and CD3/CD8/Leu7.

CD010864,0,10407689,0,The role of newer diagnostic techniques in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Among the evolving techniques for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism, contrast enhanced spiral CT takes a particularly prominent role because it is available at most centers, it images the pulmonary embolism directly, and it is minimally invasive. It has not yet been fully evaluated, however. Magnetic resonance angiography also has appeal for similar reasons. Few patients have been studied, however. Magnetic resonance angiography for pulmonary embolism is still in the early testing phase. Transesophageal echocardiography can image pulmonary embolism in central pulmonary arteries, but preliminary tests suggest that it has a low negative predictive value and cannot be used to exclude pulmonary embolism. Finally, it seems that a rapid and sensitive technique for measuring d-dimer may now be available, which may assist in eliminating the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in a significant percentage of patients in whom the diagnosis is suspected."

CD010864,0,15876996,0,A critical appraisal of non-invasive diagnosis and exclusion of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in outpatients with suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism: how many tests do we need?,"The requirement for a safe diagnostic strategy should be based on an overall posttest incidence of venous thromboembolism of less than 1% during 3 month follow-up. Compression ultrasonography (CUS) has a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97% to 98% indicating the need of repeated CUS testing. Serial CUS testing is safe but you have to repeat 100 CUS to find 1 or 2 CUS positive for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is not cost-effective indicating the need to improve the diagnostic work-up of DVT by the use of clinical score assessment and D-dimer testing. The combination of a less sensitive D-dimer test (SimpliRed) and low clinical score does not, whereas the combination of a sensitive D-dimer test (ELISA VIDAS or Tinaquant) and low clinical score does safely exclude DVT without the need of CUS. The combination of a first negative CUS and a negative less sensitive D-dimer test (SimpliRed) or a sensitive ELISA D-dimer at a higher cut off level of 1,000 ng/ml safely excludes DVT with a NPV of > 99% without the need to repeated CUS in about 60%. The sequential use of a sensitive D-dimer and clinical score assessment will safely reduce the need for CUS testing by 40% to 60%. Large prospective outcome studies demonstrate that one negative examination with complete duplex color ultrasonography (CCUS) of the proximal and distal veins of the affected leg with suspected DVT is safe to withhold anticoagulant treatment with a NPV of 99.5%. This indicates that CCUS is equal or superior to serial CUS or the combined use of clinical score, D-dimer testing and CUS. Pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for segmental pulmonary embolism (PE) but not for subsegmental PE. A normal perfusion lung scan and a normal rapid ELISA VIDAS D-dimer test safely exclude PE. Helical spiral CT detects all clinically relevant PE and a large number of alternative diagnoses in symptomatic patients with a non-diagnostic ventilation perfusion scan (VP-scan) or a high probability VP-scan. Single-slice helical CT as the primary diagnostic test in patients with suspected PE in 5 retrospective studies and in 3 prospective management studies indicate that the NPV of a normal helical spiral CT, a negative CUS of the legs together with a low or intermediate pretest clinical probability is 99%. Helical spiral CT can replace both the VP-scan and pulmonary angiography to safely rule in and out PE. The combination of clinical assessment, a rapid ELISA VIDAS D-dimer followed by CUS will reduce the need for helical spiral CT by 40% to 50%."

CD010864,0,1521903,0,Plasma exchange treatment in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies.,"This study reports on 12 patients with acute renal failure due to biopsy-proven rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and signs of systemic disease in whom antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on alcohol-fixed neutrophils and assessed in serial determinations by ELISA. The diagnosis was: Wegener's granulomatosis in nine patients who showed a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern at IIF (c-ANCA), and microscopic polyarteritis in three where a perinuclear pattern (p-ANCA) was seen. All patients underwent a course of plasma exchange - PE - (3-10 sessions per patient) associated with steroids and cyclophosphamide. The ANCA titer dropped steeply during PE in all cases and was followed by disappearance of systemic symptoms and renal function improvement within four weeks. After a follow-up period of 50 +/- 31.2 months all patients were alive without signs of disease activity; ten had stable renal function, with serum creatinine 1.8 +/- 0.7 mg/dl; two had entered regular dialysis treatment after 44 and 82 months. Our results suggest that the rapid removal of ANCA by means of PE can help control disease activity and reduce the risk of death or end-stage renal disease."
CD010864,0,21712794,0,Mouse complete stasis model of inferior vena cava thrombosis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). In the United States (U.S.), the high morbidity and mortality rates make VTE a serious health concern (1-2). After heart disease and stroke, VTE is the third most common vascular disease (3). In the U.S. alone, there is an estimated 900,000 people affected each year, with 300,000 deaths occurring annually (3). A reliable in vivo animal model to study the mechanisms of this disease is necessary. The advantages of using the mouse complete stasis model of inferior vena cava thrombosis are several. The mouse model allows for the administration of very small volumes of limited availability test agents, reducing costs dramatically. Most promising is the potential for mice with gene knockouts that allow specific inflammatory and coagulation factor functions to be delineated. Current molecular assays allow for the quantitation of vein wall, thrombus, whole blood, and plasma for assays. However, a major concern involving this model is the operative size constraints and the friability of the vessels. Also, due to the small IVC sample weight (mean 0.005 grams) it is necessary to increase animal numbers for accurate statistical analysis for tissue, thrombus, and blood assays such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA), zymography, vein wall and thrombus cellular analysis, and whole blood and plasma assays (4-8). The major disadvantage with the stasis model is that the lack of blood flow inhibits the maximal effect of administered systemic therapeutic agents on the thrombus and vein wall."
CD010864,0,22708908,0,Novel biomarkers for risk stratification and identification of life-threatening cardiovascular disease: troponin and beyond.,"Chest pain and other symptoms that may represent acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are common reasons for emergency department (ED) presentations, accounting for over six million visits annually in the United States [1]. Chest pain is the second most common ED presentation in the United States. Delays in diagnosis and inaccurate risk stratification of chest pain can result in serious morbidity and mortality from ACS, pulmonary embolism (PE), aortic dissection and other serious pathology. Because of the high morbidity, mortality, and liability issues associated with both recognized and unrecognized cardiovascular pathology, an aggressive approach to the evaluation of this patient group has become the standard of care. Clinical history, physical examination and electrocardiography have a limited diagnostic and prognostic role in the evaluation of possible ACS, PE, and aortic dissection, so clinicians continue to seek more accurate means of risk stratification. Recent advances in diagnostic imaging techniques particularly computed-tomography of the coronary arteries and aorta, have significantly improved our ability to diagnose life-threatening cardiovascular disease. In an era where health care utilization and cost are major considerations in how disease is managed, it is crucial to risk-stratify patients quickly and efficiently. Historically, biomarkers have played a significant role in the diagnosis and risk stratification of several cardiovascular disease states including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary embolus. Multiple biomarkers have shown early promise in answering questions of risk stratification and early diagnosis of cardiovascular pathology however many do not yet have wide clinical availability. The goal of this review will be to discuss these novel biomarkers and describe their potential role in direct patient care."

In a Phase I study, PNU-145156E was administered i.v. every 6 weeks. Included were patients with solid tumors; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score </=1; and normal bone marrow, renal, and liver functions and blood clotting tests. Excluded were patients with brain metastases or on steroid medication. Toxicity was scored with the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. Plasma and urine PNU-145156E was measured for pharmacokinetic analysis. The effect of PNU-145156E on serum basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was measured by sandwich ELISA. Twenty-nine patients (median age, 54 years; range, 33-71 years; 19 males and 10 females; median performance score = 1) were treated at dose levels of 100-1050 mg/m(2). We observed, during 47 treatment cycles, erratic but short-lasting decreases of antithrombin III levels (<75%) at all dose levels. Other clotting tests remained normal except during thromboembolic events. Dose-limiting toxicity was thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, and grade 3 dyspnea. PNU-145156E disappeared from the circulation, decreasing triexponentially with a long terminal half-life of 1 month. No significant change in bFGF and no objective tumor responses were observed. Disease stabilization was achieved in four patients. In conclusion, the MTD of PNU-145156E was 1050 mg/m(2). Serum bFGF level was not affected by PNU-145156E up to the MTD."
CD010864,0,12735120,0,Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism in the elderly.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a difficult diagnosis in patients of all ages, but more so in the elderly. Nonspecific symptoms and laboratory results are often misattributed to common diseases or to age itself, and can delay or even deter the diagnosis and treatment of PE. Advanced age is sometimes mistakenly seen as a contraindication to anticoagulation and thrombolysis. Together, these factors contribute to the higher morbidity and mortality associated with PE in the elderly than in younger patients. This article reviews the risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of PE as it applies to the elderly."

CD010864,0,11600204,0,Parathyroid hormone-related protein and lung injury after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.,"Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is an autocrine growth and differentiation factor for alveolar type II epithelial cells. Type II cells secrete pulmonary surfactant and are pluripotent cells with a role in alveolar epithelial repair after lung injury. The goals of this study were to investigate whether the levels of PTHrP in bronchoalveolar lavage liquid (BAL) varied between patients who did and did not develop lung injury after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE). BAL was performed in 48 patients undergoing PTE for unresolved pulmonary emboli. Samples were obtained following induction of anesthesia, following separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, and 48 h postoperatively. PTHrP was measured by radioimmunoassay. Lung injury was diagnosed in 23 patients on the basis of hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FIO(2) < 300) and the presence of lung infiltrates in the absence of infection or atelectasis. Patients with lung injury had significantly lower preoperative BAL levels of PTHrP, 21 (21-30) pg/ml (median, interquartile gap), compared to patients without lung injury, 34 (21-41) pg/ml (P < 0.05). Preoperative BAL PTHrP levels < 32 pg/ml predicted lung injury with a positive predictive value of 60% and negative predictive value of 82%. The odds of developing lung injury for patients with preoperative PTHrP levels below this cutpoint were 6 times the odds for patients with higher levels."

A degradable pH-sensitive hydrazone bond between a long shielding PEG chains and PE (PEG(2k)-Hz-PE) was introduced. TATp was conjugated with a short PEG(1k)-PE spacer and mAb 2C5 was attached to a long PEG chain (2C5-PEG(3.4k)-PE). The ""shielding"" effect of TATp by long PEG chains was investigated using three liposomal models. At normal pH, surface TATp moieties are ""hidden"" by the long PEG chains. Upon the exposure to lowered pH, this multifunctional carrier exposes TATp moieties after the degradation of the hydrazone bond and removal of the long PEG chains. Enhanced cellular uptake of the TATp-containing immunoliposomes was observed in vitro after pre-treatment at lowered pH (using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy techniques). The presence of mAb 2C5 on the liposome surface further enhanced the interaction between the carrier and tumor cells but not normal cells. Furthermore, multifunctional immuno-DoxilÂ® preparation showed increased cellular cytotoxicity of B16-F10, HeLa and MCF-7 cells when pre-incubated at lower pH, indicating TATp exposure and activity. In conclusion, a multifunctional immunoliposomal nanocarrier containing a pH-sensitive PEG-PE component, TATp, and the cancer cell-specific mAb 2C5 promotes enhanced cytotoxicity and carrier internalization by cancer cells and demonstrates the potential for intracellular drug delivery after exposure to lowered pH environment, typical of solid tumors."

CD010864,0,2958657,0,"[Significance of the thrombin-antithrombin III complex in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis--comparison with fibrinopeptide A, platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin].","In 22 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and 19 patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) as an indicator of thrombin activation was measured using a newly developed ELISA. For comparison fibrinopeptide A (FPA), as a marker of an activated coagulation, as well as platelet factor 4 (PF4), and beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), as markers of platelet activation, were determined. In all patients in whom pulmonary embolism was confirmed by perfusion lung scan and in 15 of 16 patients in whom deep vein thrombosis was confirmed by phlebography, TAT exceeded the upper limit of normal (3.0 ng/ml). FPA was increased in 71% of the pulmonary embolism patients, PF4 in 53%, and beta-TG in 59%. The data for the patients with deep vein thrombosis were comparable. PF4 and beta-TG were increased in more than 25% of the normal controls, FPA in 17%, and TAT in 9%. TAT is very sensitive in detecting an activation of the coagulation system in patients with suspected thromboembolic events. The test, however, is not specific for thromboembolism; it only indicates an activation of the coagulation system. Acute pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis would appear to be unlikely if TAT is normal. The measurement of TAT is easier and less susceptible to disturbances than that of FPA, PF4, and beta-TG."

The majority of moderate and severe pre-eclamptic women (7 out of 10) ended up with pre-term delivery as compared with 2 out of 11 who went on to term. Patients with moderate and severe PE had significantly lower levels (mean +/- SD, ng/ml) of PAI-2 (58.4 +/- 34.9) and u-PA antigen (1.61 +/- 0.62) as compared to those with mild PE (95.6 +/- 39.3 and 1.61 +/- 0.62 and 2.12 +/- 0.61, respectively). Significantly raised t-PA antigen (14.6 +/- 5.7 ng/ml) was seen in moderate and severe PE as compared with mild PE (9.9 +/- 3.4 ng/ml). PAI-1 activity was significantly raised only in moderate and severe PE as compared with normal pregnancy. There were no significant differences in thrombin-antithrombin-III complexes, D-dimer and beta-thromboglobulin levels between the PE group and normal pregnancy, although these parameters were above the non-pregnant levels. Platelets in PE were within the range found in normal pregnancy. It appears that measurements of plasma u-PA and PAI-2 levels in patients with PE may have prognostic value in determining the outcome of pregnancy in this pregnancy disorder."

Neither hemolyzed samples (Hb less than 5 g/L), icteric samples (total bilirubin less than 300 mg/L), lipemic samples (triglyceride less than 15 g/L), nor some commonly used drugs interfere. Dithioerythritol is used to eliminate interference from rheumatoid factor. Good correlation was seen when the Du Pont CRP method was compared with the Beckman ICS, Syva EMIT, TDx, and Behring methods for CRP. The normal reference interval is 0 to 9 mg/L. The method, which is fully automated, is fast, requires only a few microliters of serum, and is well suited to emergency-room requirements."
CD010864,0,22302738,0,"Human CD300a binds to phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, and modulates the phagocytosis of dead cells.","CD300a is an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) containing molecule that belongs to the CD300 family of paired activating/inhibitory receptors. It has been shown that its ligation inhibits activation signals on cells of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages. The ligands for CD300a have not been identified. Here, we show that a CD300a-Ig fusion protein specifically binds to apoptotic cells that are evolutionary apart, such as human and insect cells, suggesting that the ligand has to be conserved. Using surface plasmon resonance, ultracentrifugation, ELISA, and reporter cell assays, we identified phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS), 2 phospholipids that translocate to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of dead cells, as the ligands for CD300a. Mutational and structural modeling studies identified residues that are involved in the binding of CD300a to PE and PS and that form a cavity where the hydrophilic heads of PE and PS, can penetrate. CD300a down-regulates the uptake of apoptotic cells by macrophages and its ectopic expression in CD300a-negative cell lines also decreased the engulfment of dead cells. Collectively, our results indicate that PE and PS are ligands for CD300a, and that this interaction plays an important role in regulating the removal of dead cells."

We underline the very poor prognosis -- overall survival of 2.5 years from initial presentation -- a much reduced survival for a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm, probably due also to multiple associated pathology. Also, the other interesting element of the case is related to the dysfunctional platelets -- hemorrhagic complication at increased platelet count, respectively thrombosis at platelet count under 20000/mmc."

The interval between PE sessions varied from once daily to approximately once monthly. Typically, post-PE patterns had decreased alpha-1, decreased alpha-2, decreased beta, and decreased gamma fractions. The average percentage decreases of the immunoglobulins subsequent to PE were as follows: IgG, 52%; IgA, 55%; and IgM, 51%. There was a high linear correlation between the pre- and post-PE concentrations of IgG and IgA, whereas correlation of pre- and post-PE IgM concentrations was much lower. All IgG, IgA, and IgM levels (100%) returned to their respective reference intervals before subsequent PE when procedures were scheduled at least 2 weeks apart. When procedures occurred 1 week apart or less, only 1 IgG level (1%) returned to its reference interval, whereas 68 IgA (73%) and 74 IgM levels (80%) returned to their respective reference intervals. During this study, a faint monoclonal band was discovered in each of two patients. One had a normal baseline serum protein electrophoretogram before initiation of PE therapy, and the gammopathy was of uncertain significance. In the other patient, a vertebral plasmacytoma was discovered. It is concluded that PE reduces IgG, IgA, and IgM by approximately the same percentages; however, reference interval levels of IgA and IgM are restored more rapidly than IgG levels. Because monoclonal proteins may be present before or may appear during PE therapy, patients should be monitored by baseline and subsequent periodic serum protein electrophoresis."
CD010864,0,2542543,0,Acquired protein C deficiency in a patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Relationship to reactivity of anticardiolipin antibody with thrombomodulin.,"A 16-year-old boy had recurrent venous thromboses and pulmonary thromboembolism that caused him pulmonary hypertension. He also had livedo reticularis, thrombocytopenia and high titer IgG antiphospholipid (cardiolipin) antibodies. In the absence of clinical and laboratory evidence of SLE, he was considered to have a primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Coagulation studies revealed a functional deficiency of protein C although it was present in normal antigenic amounts. Since both his parents had normal functional and antigenic protein C findings, his deficiency was considered acquired. The reactivity of the anticardiolipin antibodies could be decreased in a dose dependent fashion when preincubated with increasing amounts of thrombomodulin, a protein required for protein C activation at the endothelial cell membrane. This interaction of antiphospholipid antibodies with thrombomodulin may help explain the occurrence of thrombosis in some patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, despite the behavior in vitro of these antibodies as circulating anticoagulants."

CD010864,0,19466972,0,Diagnostic management of clinically suspected acute deep vein thrombosis.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common disease that may lead to potentially fatal complications, such as pulmonary embolism. In the past decades several diagnostic tools and algorithms for DVT have been studied. Currently the combination of a clinical decision rule, D-dimer testing and compression ultrasonography has proved to be safe and effective for the diagnosis of DVT in the lower extremities. Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be useful as additional or secondary imaging modalities. This review will discuss the elements currently used in making the clinical diagnosis of DVT. These elements include clinical decision rules and D-dimer testing, different imaging investigations and the appropriate use of these within diagnostic algorithms in patients with clinically suspected DVT. Although current knowledge of the options available to diagnose DVT of the lower extremities is well established, there are still unresolved issues, including the optimal diagnosis of recurrent DVT and distal DVT. Furthermore, the diagnosis of DVT of the upper extremities will be discussed, including the different imaging modalities and the limitations of these techniques."

CD010864,0,11686320,0,Human thrombi contain an abundance of active thrombin.,"This study assessed the abundance and activity of thrombin in human thrombi. removed at autopsy or during surgery. Arterial and venous thrombus sections showed thrombin activity by in situ zymography, based on conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Hirudin or antibodies to thrombin abolished the activity. Thrombin activity in extracts of 40 thrombi was quantified by cleavage of fibrinogen or small peptide substrates: the results correlated well (r = 0.87, p<0.0001) with a median activity of about 4.5 IU/g of thrombus (wet weight). Activity correlated poorly with total prothrombin (median 27 microg/g) and was inversely related to antithrombin, but not to PAI-1. Zymography showed two major active bands, thrombin at 37 kDa, and a 50 kDa form that probably corresponds to meizothrombin desF1. The abundant local thrombin demonstrated here has implications for thrombus lysis and extension: incomplete lysis and exposure of active thrombin may lead to re-occlusion of vessels."
CD010864,0,8880167,0,The cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"The cost-effectiveness of various diagnostic strategies in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) was analysed using a modelling approach. In 451 consecutive patients with clinically suspected PE data on the performance of diagnostic tests were collected prospectively in two large teaching hospitals in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The ventilation-perfusion lung scan was used as the primary diagnostic test in all patients. In patients with a non-diagnostic lung scan result the performance of a clinical decision rule, a D-dimer test, and ultrasonography of the leg veins was evaluated with pulmonary angiography as the gold standard. It was estimated that the strategy recommended by a 1992 Dutch consensus meeting costs about Dfl 4400 per patient and that 97.02% of the patients can be expected to survive the first 6 months after the primary PE. The nation-wide annual costs for the diagnosis and treatment of patients by this strategy were estimated at 163 million Dutch Guilders. Subsequently, the costs and effects of alternative strategies were evaluated in a modelling approach, and compared with those of the consensus strategy. One strategy was selected that produces the best results in terms of survival and leads to considerable savings as compared with the consensus strategy. In this strategy subsequently a ventilation-perfusion scan, a clinical decision rule, a D-dimer test, a pulmonary angiography and leg ultrasonography are performed. Patients with a high probability ventilation-perfusion scan, an abnormal angiography or leg ultrasound test are treated, whereas treatment is withheld in patients with a normal ventilation-perfusion scan, a normal clinical decision rule, a negative D-dimer test, a normal angiography, or a normal leg ultrasound test. This strategy will have to prove its value and usefulness in clinical practice in a subsequent prospective validation phase."

CD010864,0,21478122,0,D-dimer is helpful for differentiating acute aortic dissection and acute pulmonary embolism from acute myocardial infarction.,"Acute aortic dissection (AAD), acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are all emergent diseases with acute chest pain. However, it is sometimes difficult to diagnose these diseases by symptoms, ECG changes and/or cardiac biomarkers, especially immediately after onset. Because these diseases are all thrombogenic diseases, we considered that D-dimer could be helpful to differentiate these diseases. The purpose of this research was to define the D-dimer value for discrimination between AAD, PE and AMI."
CD010864,0,9004449,0,A virosome vaccine antigen delivery system does not stimulate an antiphospholipid antibody response in humans.,"A virosome vaccine delivery system comprised of the hemagglutinin of influenza A virus incorporated into unilamellar liposomes consisting of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) or only PC was developed. The anti-PE and anti-PC antibody response was determined for human volunteers immunized with a virosome-formulated vaccine against hepatitis A, or a standard or virosome-formulated influenza vaccine. None of the 100 young adults who received two doses of the hepatitis A vaccine 1 year apart mounted a significant (greater than fourfold) antiphospholipid antibody response. Immunization with a single dose of trivalent influenza vaccine engendered a significant anti-PC and anti-PE antibody response in 1 of 32 elderly nursing home residents who received the virosome-formulated influenza vaccine and in 1 of the 31 residents who received a commercial subunit vaccine. These findings indicate that the virosome system can potentiate the human immune response to vaccine antigens without a concomitant rise in antiphospholipid antibodies."
CD010864,0,12743016,0,Classic and novel risk factor parameters in women with a history of preeclampsia.,"Epidemiological studies demonstrate a relation between preeclampsia (PE) and an increased risk of maternal coronary heart disease (CHD) in later life. However, there are few data available to explain any underlying mechanism. We recruited 40 primigravid women with a history of proteinuric PE delivering between 1975 and 1985 and 40 controls, matched as a group for time of index pregnancy, smoking, and current body mass index to assess classic (lipids, blood pressure) and novel (adhesion molecules, insulin, leptin) risk factor pathways. Women with a history of PE had higher diastolic blood pressure compared with controls (83 vs 76 mm Hg, P<0.05), but there were no significant differences in fasting lipoprotein concentrations (P>0.20). However, concentrations of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in particular were higher in the PE group by 14% (P=0.038) and 44% (P=0.002), respectively. The cases also demonstrated a tendency toward higher fasting insulin (P=0.08) concentrations and had higher glycosylated hemoglobin levels (P=0.004). Leptin concentrations were not significantly elevated. Interestingly, significantly more of the women with history of PE were classified as menopausal (37.55% vs 17.5%, P=0.045). The differences in ICAM-1 concentration persisted (P=0.010) after adjustment for potential confounders, including hormonal use/menopausal status, antihypertensive or lipid-lowering therapy, and social class. We conclude that classic risk factors alone cannot fully explain the elevated CHD risk in women with a history of PE. Rather markedly elevated ICAM-1 concentrations and specific but subtle features of the metabolic syndrome (glucose, blood pressure) are likely to be involved."

CD010864,0,10598318,0,Developmental changes in phosphatidylinositol transfer protein concentration and phospholipid transfer activities in rat type II cells.,"The phospholipid transfer proteins (PLTPs) are cytosolic proteins that have been characterized by their ability to facilitate the transfer of phospholipids between membranes in vitro. The goals of this study were to determine whether PITP alpha concentration and phospholipid transfer activities are enriched in type II cells compared with whole lung and to determine the developmental changes in PITP alpha concentration and phospholipid transfer activities during late gestation and newborn period. The concentration of PITP alpha in type II cell cytosol measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) increased during late fetal gestation to 2.2-fold adult levels and declined 41% during the first postnatal day. However, compared to whole adult lung cytosol, type II cell cytosol was not significantly enriched with PITP alpha. Phospholipid transfer activities were determined by a vesicle-rat lung membrane transfer assay. In adult lung, transfer activities for all the phospholipids were enriched in adult type II cell cytosol compared to whole lung cytosol (phosphatidylglycerol [PG], 12.5-fold; phosphatidylinositol [PI], 9.2-fold; phosphatidylcholine [PC], 6.5-fold; and phosphatidylethanolamine [PE], 6.6-fold; P < .05 in each case). The rate of phospholipid transfer in type II cell cytosol increased during late fetal gestation to levels 4.9 (PG), 3.7 (PI), and 2.8 (PC) times greater than adult levels. In cytosol from cells from different stages, the order of transfer rate was PG > PI > PC > PE. PITP alpha immunodepletion of adult type II cytosol did not significantly affect phospholipid transfer activities, suggesting that other PLTPs are responsible for the majority of the observed transfer activities in these cells. Developmental increases in PITP alpha concentration and other PLTPs parallel developmental changes in type II cell surfactant phospholipid metabolism, suggesting a possible role of these transfer proteins in the unique function of the type II cell."

After exposure to heparin, some patients develop heparin dependent antibodies with no evidence of thrombosis, while others are at risk of thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, limb loss, and death. We conducted a retrospective chart review on all patients serologically positive for HIT by HPIA ELISA in a single tertiary-care hospital, to determine whether patients with malignancy had an increased risk of thrombotic complications. Medical records of 55 patients who tested positive for HIT and met clinical criteria for HIT were analyzed. All patients had been treated with unfractionated heparin. Malignancy was diagnosed in 11 patients, either at surgery or post-mortem examination. A higher rate of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was observed in patients with HIT and malignant disease when compared to patients with no underlying malignancy (odds ratio 13.6, 95% CI 2.9-63.8)."

Between August 1995 and June 1997, blood was collected from 66 140 people in the second Norwegian Health Study of Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag (HUNT2). During a seven-year follow-up, 505 VT cases were identified. 1458 age- and sex-matched controls were selected from the original cohort. Serum total homocysteine (tHcy) and MTHFR genotype were measured in stored samples that were drawn a median of 33 months before the events. The overall odds ratio (OR) was 1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-2.30] for homocysteine levels above versus below the 95th percentile. There was no graded association with VT over quintiles of homocysteine. In men the OR was 2.17 (95% CI 1.20-3.91) for levels above versus below the 95th percentile, but no association was found in women (OR 1.00). Stratification by age, predisposing risk factors or time to event did not change these results. The MTHFR 677TT genotype was not related to risk for VT. In conclusion, elevated homocysteine levels in the general population predicted subsequent first VT in men but not in women."
CD010864,0,20980403,0,Klf5 regulates lineage formation in the pre-implantation mouse embryo.,"Kruppel-like transcription factors (Klfs) are essential for the induction and maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), yet little is known about their roles in establishing the three lineages of the pre-implantation embryo. Here, we show that Klf5 is required for the formation of the trophectoderm (TE) and the inner cell mass (ICM), and for repressing primitive endoderm (PE) development. Although cell polarity appeared normal, Klf5 mutant embryos arrested at the blastocyst stage and failed to hatch due to defective TE development. Klf5 acted cell-autonomously in the TE, downstream of Fgf4 and upstream of Cdx2, Eomes and Krt8. In the ICM, loss of Klf5 resulted in reduced expression of pluripotency markers Oct4 and Nanog, but led to increased Sox17 expression in the PE, suggesting that Klf5 suppresses the PE lineage. Consistent with this, overexpression of Klf5 in transgenic embryos was sufficient to suppress the Sox17(+) PE lineage in the ICM. Klf5 overexpression led to a dose-dependent decrease in Sox17 promoter activity in reporter assays in cultured cells. Moreover, in chimeric embryos, Klf5(-/-) cells preferentially contributed to the Sox17(+) PE lineage and Cdx2 expression was not rescued in Klf5(-/-) outer cells. Finally, outgrowths from Klf5(-/-) embryos failed to form an ICM/pluripotent colony, had very few Oct4(+) or Cdx2(+) cells, but showed an increase in the percentage of Sox17(+) PE cells. These findings demonstrate that Klf5 is a dynamic regulator of all three lineages in the pre-implantation embryo by promoting the TE and epiblast lineages while suppressing the PE lineage."
CD010864,0,11270125,0,Pulmonary embolism in the elderly.,"The elderly are at increased risk for pulmonary embolism because of both the conditions common to this age group, and the immobility that often accompanies them. Whether aging alone represents a hypercoagulable state is unclear. The incidence of pulmonary embolism rises with age, however, as does pulmonary embolism mortality. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is difficult and frequently missed because elderly patients and their physicians may attribute nonspecific symptoms to underlying cardiopulmonary disease or to age itself. Routine laboratory examinations are also nonspecific. Lower extremity studies to diagnose DVT should always be pursued because a positive study results in identical treatment, without the need for further testing. D-dimer concentrations are useful when low, but are commonly elevated in the elderly because of other comorbid conditions. Lung scanning remains the most common initial study to diagnose pulmonary embolism, although spiral CT is as sensitive and specific. Pulmonary angiography should always be considered when the initial studies are nondiagnostic and clinical suspicion is high, and this test is well tolerated in the elderly. The role of newer diagnostic techniques, such as MR imaging, cannot be determined until well-designed outcomes trials are completed. Prophylaxis with appropriate pharmacologic agents or mechanical measures should be administered not only to patients undergoing hip or knee reconstruction surgery, but to all bed-ridden elderly medical and general surgery patients. Treatment for pulmonary embolism with anticoagulation reduces the mortality rate and should be administered in all elderly patients without contraindications. In addition, thrombolysis should be considered for all hemodynamically unstable patients with pulmonary embolism, regardless of age. Vena caval filters are warranted when anticoagulation is contraindicated, although evidence of the long-term benefit of these devices is lacking. At present, pulmonary embolism is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the elderly. By heightening awareness of this diagnosis and its appropriate management in this age group, considerable morbidity and mortality may be avoided."

CD010864,0,18775637,0,[Massive pulmonary embolism].,"Massive pulmonary embolism is defined by systemic hypotension or cardiogenic shock. Clinically stable patients with right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, elevated brain natriuretic peptide or troponin are usually considered as having sub-massive pulmonary embolism, but this definition is not universally accepted. The time-lag to confirm massive pulmonary embolism should be kept as short as possible and every effort should be done to rely on bedside tests and to avoid patient transfer to the radiology department. D-dimer tests are useless in this setting and the diagnosis is mainly based on clinical probability and bedside echocardiography. When clinical probability is high, right ventricular dilatation assessed by echocardiography allows confirming the diagnosis without additional testing. On the other hand a normal echocardiography does not allow excluding pulmonary embolism. In this setting, a spiral computed tomography is mandatory after the patient has been stabilized. Anticoagulant treatment should be started as soon as pulmonary embolism has been suspected. Supportive care includes oxygen, fluid loading and inotropes. There is little doubt that thrombolytic treatment is of value in patients with massive pulmonary embolism. Conversely, the use of thrombolytic therapy in patients with so-called sub-massive pulmonary embolism remains controversial. Current data do not confirm that thrombolytic therapy decreases mortality in those patients but cannot exclude a clinically significant benefit. A large randomised comparison of heparin and thrombolysis in patients with sub-massive pulmonary embolism is underway to answer this question. Surgical or catheter embolectomy is nowadays only rarely performed in patients with pulmonary embolism. This method can be undertaken in the few patients with persisting shock despite supportive care and who have an absolute contraindication for thrombolytic therapy. Before new data are available there is no special indication for vena cava interruption in patients with massive pulmonary embolism."

Samples were obtained from a total of 91 subjects: 10 newly-diagnosed primary generalized epilepsy (PGE) patients who had started treatment with valproic acid and phenytoin for seizure control; 18 PGE patients who were previously and currently receiving treatment with valproic acid and phenytoin for seizure control; 37 patients with partial epilepsy (PE) (simple, n=17 or complex, n=20) who had been and were still being treated with carbazebime for seizures; and 26 healthy controls. CgA immunoreactivity in healthy salivary gland was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. The levels of CgA, total ghrelin and obestatin in serum and saliva were measured by ELISA. The results revealed that normal salivary gland produces its own CgA. Before treatment, CgA levels in saliva and serum were significantly greater in patients newly-diagnosed with PGE than controls. Ghrelin and CgA concentrations were also greater in PGE patients previously or currently treated with drugs, and in patients with simple or complex partial epilepsy (PE) previously or currently treated with drugs, than in healthy normal controls. In conclusion, salivary concentrations of CgA, ghrelin and obestatin were similar to their serum levels, so saliva might be a desirable alternative to serum for measuring these hormones because it is easy and painless to collect."

CD010864,0,12632609,0,[Intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy for refractory juvenile dermatomyositis].,"We described three children with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) refractory to the conventional therapy. They were successfully treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY) pulses, and two of them were administered plasma exchange (PE) before IVCY. Case 1. A 17-year-old girl with JDM was previously treated for 2 years with the combination of prednisolone, intravenous gamma-globulin, methotrexate, and azathioprine. However, muscle weakness gradually progressed. She failed to hold her sitting position and to rise her arms, but both serum CK and aldolase were stable. After the episode of aspiration pneumonia the follow-up muscle biopsy was performed, which revealed muscle degeneration and massive mononuclear cell infiltration in perivascular area. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fibrin degradation product E (FDP-E) levels were gradually increased. Because the active inflammation of muscle and muscle vasculature was suspected, the PE and IVCY combination therapy was administered. During the 6 courses of the therapy, muscle weakness was markedly improved so that she could hold herself at the sitting position and could have meals by herself. Case 2. A 5-year-old boy with JDM was treated for 8 months with prednisolone p.o., but his muscle strength became worse. The muscle enzyme levels, such as serum CK and aldolase, were not reflecting his status of the disease, but FDP-E levels were increased. Muscle MRI and biopsy revealed the inflammatory changes of perivascular area of muscle. The PE and IVCY combination therapy was effective, and he became able to walk and run by himself. Case 3. A 14-year-old boy was diagnosed as having JDM when he was 10 years of age, and treated with prednisolone p.o., and subsequently with intravenous methylprednisolone pulses and azathioprine. Three years later the flares were observed accompanied with the elevations of serum CK and FDP-E. The administration of IVCY improved muscle strength as well as serum muscle enzyme and FDP-E levels. These findings indicated that the clinical manifestations of JDM should be closely monitored, that the serum levels of muscle enzymes including CK and aldolase were sometimes not indicative for the flares of JDM, and that muscle MRI and re-biopsy examination were needed for the children with progressive muscle weakness. In addition, determination of ESR and FDP-E was not specific but helpful to detect flares of the disease in some cases."

Both are synthesized in the atria and ventricles as polypeptides, which upon release are split into ANP and BNP and the N-terminal fragments N-ANP and N-BNP (together named natriuretic peptides, NPs). The most important function of ANP and BNP is protection against volume-overload, by increasing natriuresis and diuresis amongst other things. Both peptides can be considered the natural antagonist of the renin-angiotensin system. Clearance occurs through a specific receptor and through enzymatic break-down by neutral endopeptidase (NEP). All 4 NPs circulate in plasma. Elevated concentrations of NPs are found when the filling pressures of the heart are elevated, as in acute coronary syndromes and congestive heart failure. Measurement of NPs is a useful tool in the differential diagnosis of cardiac versus non-cardiac dyspnoe (high negative predictive value), in the identification of heart failure patients most at risk and in optimising therapy in heart failure. In right ventricular overload caused by (corrected) congenital heart diseases and acute lung embolism, NP concentrations are also elevated, as they are in renal failure and in hypertension associated with left ventricular hypertrophy. Infusions of ANP and BNP lead to increased natriuresis and diuresis. Pharmacologically, increases in ANP and BNP can be accomplished with NEP-inhibitors or beta-blockers. Measurement of NP(s) will become as important for estimation of heart function as creatinine is for estimation of renal function."

The aim was to assess the recent incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after total knee arthroplasty without chemoprophylaxis in Koreans, the efficacy of plasma d-dimer levels as a screening test, and the associated risk factors. Deep vein thrombosis was found in 79 knees (26.60%). There were 9 cases (3.03%) of proximal DVT, 70 cases (23.57%) of distal DVT, and no symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Although this cohort had limited number of patients by a single surgeon, there is still low incidence of proximal DVT in Koreans with rare pulmonary embolism occurrence compared with those of the Western. High postoperative d-dimer levels were correlative, but no appropriate cutoff value was found. Obesity was a significant associated risk factor."

He was presented to the emergency room with headache and fever. His temperature was 39.5Â°C, laboratory results revealed a white blood count of 15.2Ã10(3)/Î¼l and C reactive protein 22.6 mg/dl. The patient was admitted. Chest X-ray showed the infiltrate in bilateral lower lung area. He received 400 mg of clarithromycin per day. His all symptoms did not change. On the 8(th) day in the hospital, the patient's antibiotics were switched to pazufloxacin. Chest and abdominal CT scan showed some irregular patchy nodules of around 1 cm in diameter in the bilateral lower lung fields and a round low density lesion 3 cm in diameter in the right upper segment (S8) in the liver. Blood culture revealed Fusobacterium necrophorum. On the 10(th) day, the antibacterial agent was changed from pazufloxacin to ampicillin sulbactam. On the 17(th) day, we added clindamycin. As a result his temperature gradually returned to normal. It is reported that the titer of anticardiolipin antibody increases in the sepsis patients caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. As his symptoms disappeared, his titer of anticardiolipin antibody also decreased. So we considered he had a transient anticardiolipin titer increase."

CD010864,0,17906973,0,Treatment of DVT: how long is enough and how do you predict recurrence.,"Currently available anticoagulants are effective in reducing the recurrence rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, anticoagulant treatment is associated with an increased risk for bleeding complications. Thus, anticoagulation has to be discontinued when benefit of treatment no longer clearly outweigh its risks. The duration of anticoagulant treatment is currently framed based on the estimated individual risk for recurrent VTE. The incidence of recurrent VTE can be estimated through a two-step decision algorithm. Firstly, the features of the patient (gender), of the initial event (proximal or distal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), and the associated conditions (cancer, surgery, etc) provide essential information on the risk for recurrence after anticoagulant treatment discontinuation. Secondly, at time of anticoagulant treatment discontinuation, D: -dimer levels and residual thrombosis have been indicated as predictors of recurrent VTE. Current evidence suggests that the risk of recurrence after stopping therapy is largely determined by whether the acute episode of VTE has been effectively treated and by the patient's intrinsic risk of having a new episode of VTE. All patients with acute VTE should receive oral anticoagulant treatment for three months. At the end of this treatment period, physicians should decide for withdrawal or indefinite anticoagulation. Based on intrinsic patient's risk for recurrent VTE and for bleeding complications and on patient preference, selected patients could be allocated to indefinite treatment with VKA with scheduled periodic re-assessment of the benefit from extending anticoagulation. Alternative strategies for secondary prevention of VTE to be used after conventional anticoagulation are currently under evaluation. Cancer patients should receive low molecular-weight heparin over warfarin in the long-term treatment of VTE. These patients should be considered for extended anticoagulation at least until resolution of underlying disease. The risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism can be estimated through a two-step algorithm. Firstly, the features of the patient (gender), of the initial event (proximal or distal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), and the associated conditions (cancer, surgery, etc) are essential to estimate the risk for recurrence after anticoagulant treatment discontinuation. Secondly, a correlation has been shown between D: -dimer levels and residual thrombosis at time of anticoagulant treatment discontinuation and the risk of recurrence. Currently available anticoagulants are effective in reducing the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism, but they are associated with an increased risk for bleeding complications. All patients with acute venous thromboembolism should receive oral anticoagulant treatment for three months. At the end of this treatment period physicians should decide for definitive withdrawal or indefinite anticoagulation with scheduled periodic re-assessment of the benefit from extending anticoagulation."

CD010864,0,12479878,0,Evaluation of advanced D-dimer assay for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism.,"The performances for thromboembolic disease exclusion of a new microlatex-enhanced D-dimer immunoassay have been evaluated. Advanced D-dimer (Dade-Behring, Marburg, Germany) was tested with two automated analyzers, namely BCS and CA-1500. Precision studies yielded coefficients of variation (within-run and run-to-run) of 3% and 6.3% at D-dimer levels near the cut-off value, for BCS and CA-1500 respectively. Frozen samples from 294 consecutive symptomatic outpatients suspected of either deep venous thrombosis (140) or pulmonary embolism (154) from a previous management study were tested with both analyzers, as well as with the VIDAS New assay (BioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). For BCS, sensitivity and specificity were 96.6% (95% CI, 90.5, 99.3) and 42% (35.1, 49.0) respectively at a cut-off value of 1.35 microg/ml. For CA-1500, the corresponding figures were 95.5% (88.9, 98.8) and 47.8% (40.8, 54.9) at a cutt-off value of 1.1 microg/ml. This assay appears promising and should be validated in clinical practise to assess its place in the work-up schemes of thromboembolism."

CD010864,0,12723250,0,Plasma D-dimer concentrations in different clinical conditions.,"D-dimers (DD), specific degradation products of crosslinked fibrin, are markers for activation of plasma coagulation and/or fibrinolysis. DD results below the cut-off level are proven to be useful to rule out the probable diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE). Our objective was to demonstrate that positive DD occur in many diseases and certain physiological conditions as high age and pregnancy and to look for gradations in positivity between different pathological conditions. We wanted to investigate the request attitude of our clinicians concerning DD. Positive DD results still confuse some physicians. Retrospectively, we examined medical records of 574 consecutive patients, in whom plasma DD were measured in daily routine. Both outpatients (n = 423) and inpatients (n = 151) were included. We noted their clinically predominant disease. Measurement of DD concentration is too often requested by clinicians, in any medical condition, and is not always clinically relevant. The relation of a positive result and the clinical problem is sometimes not understood. Overall, we found 64% DD positivity with a median concentration of 775 micrograms/L. We found elevated DD concentrations in various clinical conditions."

Significant difference was found between Group II and Group III (p less than 0.05). The mean (+/- SE) ratio of PE/serum (PE/S) ferritin in Groups I, II, III, and IV was 3.5 +/- 1.1, 10.5 +/- 5.1, 4.9 +/- 1.0, and 2.0 +/- 0.7, respectively, and it showed no significant difference among Groups I, II, and III. There were good correlations between PE-ferritin and PE-LDH or S-ferritin, but no correlation between PE-ferritin and PE-protein. PE-ferritin revealed a considerable overlap among the exudative groups, and was of no value in the differentiation between malignant and nonmalignant (Group I + II) exudates. In the discrimination between exudates and transudates, the diagnostic accuracy (86%) of PE-ferritin was inferior to those (all 98%) of PE-protein, PE-LDH, PE/S protein ratio, and PE/S LDH ratio. Using PE-ferritin greater than or equal to 500 ng/ml in distinguishing malignant exudates from TB effusions, the sensitivity was 79%, specificity 57% and accuracy 71%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010864,0,21947468,0,Threshold of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1/placental growth factor ratio for the imminent onset of preeclampsia.,"It has not been clarified whether thresholds of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble endoglin, and the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio for the imminent onset of preeclampsia (PE) exist. We hypothesized that onset thresholds for the imminent onset of PE could be determined by the distributions of these 4 markers just after the onset of PE. Study subjects were 51 PE after the onset of PE; 36 of PE, 20 of gestational hypertension, 142 of a small-for-gestational-age infant, and 400 of normal pregnant controls at 19 to 25 and 27 to 31 weeks of gestation in a prospective cohort study. The current data supported our hypothesis that onset thresholds of sFlt-1 and the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio exist. The onset thresholds of the sFlt-1/PlGF at 26 to 31 weeks of gestation were useful for detecting imminent PE with the onset at <36 weeks of gestation, showing sensitivity of 0.36 and a positive likelihood ratio and 95th percent CIs of 38 (11-132); when positive, PE occurred at 2.2Â±0.6 weeks (range: 1.4-3.0 weeks) after the measurement of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. The combination of sFlt-1 at 26 to 31 weeks of gestation, past history of gestational hypertension or PE, prepregnancy body mass index, and mean blood pressure at 16 to 23 weeks of gestation was useful for detecting PE with onset of <36 weeks of gestation, showing sensitivity of 0.82, and a positive likelihood ratio (95% CI) of 42 (20-88). In conclusion, the onset threshold of sFlt-1/PlGF existed and might be useful for detecting the imminent onset of PE."

Although several vaccines have been tested under laboratory conditions, field trials of vaccines for the control of P. multocida in rabbits are few. We used a potassium thiocyanate extract (PTE) produced from P. multocida serotype D:3,12,15 to vaccinate Pasteurella-free rabbits at their introduction into a colony having endemic infection with P. multocida serotype A:3. Groups of 15 rabbits were vaccinated either SC or IN with 1.0 mg PTE once weekly for 3 wk. In addition a control group was sham-vaccinated IN with saline. After the last vaccine dose had been administered, rabbits were housed with the general colony of a facility with endemic pasteurellosis. Serum samples obtained before and 5 and 24 wk after the first dose of vaccine were evaluated by ELISA for anti-PTE IgG. Rabbits were euthanized if found in poor clinical condition, and all remaining rabbits were euthanized 24 wk after initial vaccination. Clinical disease typical of P. multocida infection was observed in 10 of 15 saline-vaccinated rabbits, 4 of 15 IN PTE-vaccinated rabbits, and 1 of 15 SC PTE-vaccinated rabbits. Bacterial culture of the nasopharynx at the time of necropsy was positive for P. multocida in 10 of 15 control rabbits, 5 of 15 IN PTE-vaccinated rabbits, and 1 of 15 SC PTE-vaccinated rabbits. Anti-PTE serum IgG activity had developed in both IN- and SC-vaccinated rabbits by 5 wk, with significantly lower activity by 24 wk after initial vaccination. IgG activity was significantly greater in rabbits vaccinated SC compared with controls or those vaccinated IN. In summary, PTE can be used to stimulate protective immunity to a heterologous strain of P. multocida, with stronger immunity generated by SC than IN vaccination."

Noninvasive strategies have become an attractive clinical option for effective diagnosis. There has been controversy, however, regarding the use of standard clinical rules in a primary care setting. The objective of the present study was to validate a noninvasive diagnostic strategy in an emergency unit giving assistance to patients with primary and secondary care needs. A total of 291 outpatients (primary and secondary care needs) with suspected venous thromboembolism attending the emergency unit of a general hospital from August 2002 to 2004 were retrospectively evaluated. The diagnostic strategy included assessment of risk for venous thromboembolism and a rapid quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-dimer test. Venous thromboembolism was ruled out in patients with a low-probability or intermediate-probability risk (or an unlikely diagnosis) and a negative D-dimer. The prevalence of venous thromboembolism was 8.2%. Patients with an unlikely diagnosis comprised 93.8% of the evaluations for deep venous thrombosis, and those with a low probability for pulmonary embolism comprised 81.4%. Proportions of patients with venous thromboembolic events observed were 7.2% in patients with an unlikely diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and 3.0% in those with low probability for pulmonary embolism. The percentage of patients with a thrombotic event excluded using this strategy was 37% (positive predictive value 13%, negative predictive value 100%). In conclusion, this noninvasive clinical strategy is safe for ruling out venous thromboembolism, and excludes the need for imaging tests in about one-third of the patients in the population studied."
CD010864,0,2009807,0,Laboratory parameters to monitor safety and efficacy during thrombolytic therapy.,"Thrombolytic therapy is being used with increasing frequency in myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and peripheral arterial occlusion. Use of these agents, however, is hampered by concerns regarding safety and efficacy. Numerous laboratory parameters have been evaluated for monitoring the risk of bleeding complications, with levels of fibrinogen (and percentage of decrease) and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) correlating to a variable extent with clinical bleeding. The bleeding time (BT) test has also been proposed as a potential predictor of bleeding during thrombolytic therapy. With respect to efficacy, the D-dimer fragment of FDPs, when corrected for soluble fibrin polymers, has been shown to correlate with clot lysis in venous thromboembolism but not MI. The BT also is being considered as a marker of lysis in patients with DVT. Given the increasing concomitant use of antiplatelet agents during thrombolytic therapy, the BT, as an in vivo test of hemostasis and platelet function, has potential utility as a noninvasive, adjunctive marker of thrombolytic efficacy."
CD010864,0,9601867,0,[The role of D-dimer determination in clinical evaluation with pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy].,"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is even in contemporary clinical practice problematical. Pulmonary angiography is used in our departments very little due to its invasive character. The method of choice for diagnosis remains therefore perfusion scintigraphy of the lungs, in this country frequently without ventilation scintigraphy as it is not available in the majority of our departments of nuclear medicine. In recent years in the diagnostic algorithms also assessment of D-dimers was started, i.e. assessment of products of fibrinolysis assessed by monoclonal antibodies. The authors tried to find out how many patients admitted to the medical department for diagnosis of pulmonary embolization may have a false positive diagnosis on the basis of pulmonary scintigraphy. During the period III/96 to V/96 a total of 18 patients from the medical clinic with suspected pulmonary embolism were examined where the value of D-dimers(latex test) was assessed and at the same time perfusion scintigraphy was performed. With regard to the highly negative predictive value of D-dimer assessment the authors focused their attention on patients with a suspect or positive lung scan (i.e. treated on account of pulmonary embolism) while D-dimers were negative. Of 13 patients with suspect or possible pulmonary embolism, as assessed by scintigraphy, four had negative dimers(30%). With regard to the 90% reported negative predictive value, based on the literature, thus three of these patients were unnecessarily admitted to hospital and treated. The authors assume that assessment of D-dimers should be part of the examination protocol due to its non-pretentious character and low price as compared with costs of hospitalization."
CD010864,0,11136946,0,Venous thromboembolism after acute stroke.,"Treatment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is highly effective in preventing morbidity and mortality, yet pulmonary embolism (PE) accounts for up to 25% of early deaths after stroke. This is because the current diagnostic paradigm is reactive rather than proactive: the clinician responds to VTE when it becomes symptomatic, in the expectation that initiation of treatment will prevent progression to more serious manifestations. This approach is flawed, because sudden death from PE is frequently unheralded and nonfatal symptomatic pulmonary emboli are often unrecognized or misdiagnosed."

They are ubiquitous environmental contaminants which bioaccumulate with several health effects for humans and the environment. This study investigated immunotoxic effects of the PBF tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBP A), tetrabromobisphenol A-bisallylether (TBBP A-AE), tetrabromobisphenol A-bis-(2,3-dibromopropyl-ether) (TBBP A-PE), decabromodiphenylether (DBDE), and 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP) in vitro. The structurally related polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon 3,4,3',4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB77) and dioxins mediate their immunotoxicity via the Ah-receptor gene complex. A highly relevant function of the Ah receptor, the induction of CYP 1A1 in hepatocytes of C57BL/6 mice by the established inducers 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) and PCB77 was compared to the effect of PBF by measurement of ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD) activity. The PBF did not show any induction of CYP 1A1, while EROD activity of hepatocytes exposed to MC and PCB77 was induced 10.8- and 8.7-fold, respectively. To investigate immunotoxic effects of the flame retardants, splenocytes of C57BL/6 mice were incubated with subtoxic doses of the flame retardants and PCB77 and activated by concanavalin A (Con A). The flame retardants TBBP A and TBBP A-AE significantly inhibited the expression of interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25) in contrast to TBBP A-PE, DBDE, TBP, and PCB77 as shown by immunohistochemistry and quantitative analysis by laser scanning cytometry. None of the substances had any effect on the Con A-induced production of cytokines. Hence, TBBP A and TBBP A-AE may act as immunotoxic compounds by specifically inhibiting the expression of CD25."

We surveyed 47 case report abstracts of nephrotic syndrome patients having thromboembolism on the Japanese Journal of Nephrology published from 1974 to 1986. The histopathology of their renal biopsies showed the high incidence of membranous glomerulonephritis, followed by minimal change nephrotic syndrome and focal glomerular sclerosis. Renal vein thrombosis was the most common thromboembolism in the reports, followed by thrombosis of cerebral vessels, peripheral vessels and pulmonary artery.

Given that many patients awaiting transplantation are exposed to heparin for prolonged periods, we sought to determine the frequency of HIT and its consequences among patients before and after cardiac transplantation."

CD010864,0,8691509,0,Catecholamine concentrations and contractile responses of isolated vessels from hens treated with cyclic phenyl saligenin phosphate or paraoxon in the presence or absence of verapamil.,"Blood samples and vascular segments from the ischiadic artery of hens treated with either cyclic phenyl saligenin phosphate (PSP; 2.5 micrograms/kg, im) or paraoxon (PXN; 0.1 micrograms/kg, im) in the presence or absence of verapamil, a calcium channel antagonist (7 micrograms/kg, im, given 4 consecutive days beginning the day before PSP or PXN administration), were examined 1, 3, 7, and 21 d after PSP or PXN administration in order to determine the contribution of catecholamines and peripheral blood vessel physiology and morphology to organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN). The levels of plasma catecholamines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatograpy (HPLC) and indicated a different effect with PSP, which causes OPIDN, and PXN, which does not. PSP treatment elevated the levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine throughout the study, while PXN treatment depressed the levels of these catecholamines. Verapamil treatment attenuated the OP response by approximately 50% for both compounds. Ischiadic vessel segments were isolated from OP-treated hens and perfused at a constant flow rate of 12 ml/min, then examined for their response to potassium chloride (KCl, 3 x 10(-3) M), acetylcholine (ACh), phenylephrine (PE), an alpha 1 adrenergic agonist, and salbutamol (SAL), a beta 2 adrenergic agonist. Agents were delivered in concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-3) M. Vascular segments did not respond to ACh or SAL at any concentration used. Vessels displayed a significant reduction in contractile response to both KCl (3 x 10(-3) M) and PE (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) 3 and 21 d after exposure to either PSP or PXN. This reduced response was not altered by the presence of verapamil. Innervation of the peripheral vasculature was unchanged after OP treatment. This study indicates that plasma catecholamine levels could be differentially altered by treatment with OPs that do and do not cause OPIDN and suggests that the alterations involve intracellular calcium. In contrast, vascular response of the ischiadic artery was altered following OP treatment, but the effect was not specific for the neuropathy-inducing OP, PSP, and response was not mediated by Ca 2+, nor was it the result of autonomic nerve deterioration."

CD010864,0,11021257,0,"Improving detection of venous thromboembolism. New technology holds promise for early, precise diagnosis.","In recent years, a number of modalities have been evaluated for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. The role of these modalities is still evolving. While ventilation-perfusion scanning is important in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism, spiral CT scanning, MRI, and D-dimer assays are now being used more often, either exclusively or in combination with ventilation-perfusion scanning. A number of diagnostic algorithms using these modalities are currently being evaluated. Regardless of which diagnostic approach is used, the clinician must be aware of some key limitations. Spiral CT scanning has gained popularity because it is noninvasive and can rapidly identify other cardiopulmonary diseases that mimic pulmonary embolism. Its use has been limited because of its inability to detect subsegmental pulmonary emboli. D-dimer assays offer promise as rapid, inexpensive screening tools. However, the wide variability in assay performance has limited its usefulness. We recommend that if D-dimer assays are to be used in a diagnostic algorithm, the clinician be aware of the details of the assay. At present, lack of data precludes use of MRI as a primary diagnostic tool for detection of venous thromboembolism."
CD010864,0,3149283,0,Tissue plasminogen activator and acute pulmonary embolism.,"We assessed the efficacy and safety of peripheral intravenous recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in 47 patients with angiographically documented pulmonary embolism (PE). We administered 50 mg/2 h and, if necessary, an additional 40 mg/4 h. By 6 hours, 94% of the patients had angiographic evidence of clot lysis that was slight in 5, moderate in 12, and marked in 27 patients. Among the 34 patients with pulmonary hypertension prior to treatment, average pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 43/17 (27) to 31/13 (19) mm Hg (P less than 0.0001). The average lung scan perfusion defect decreased from 37% before therapy to 16% (P less than 0.01) after therapy among the 19 patients who had pre- and post-treatment lung scans. Of 7 patients with pre- and post-treatment imaging and Doppler echocardiograms, hypokinetic right ventricular wall movement (mild in 1, moderate in 2, and severe in 4) normalized in 5 and improved to mild hypokinesis in 2. Right ventricular diameter decreased from 3.9 +/- 1.0 to 2.0 +/- 0.5 cm (P less than 0.005). Fibrinogen decreased 33% from baseline at 2 h and 42% from baseline at 6 h. However, patients with the greatest degree of angiographic clot lysis at 2 h had a preponderance of fibrinogenolysis over fibrinolysis, demonstrated by a lower ratio of cross-linked fibrin degradation products to fibrin(ogen) degradation products (0.14 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.82) (P less than 0.04). Among selected patients, peripheral intravenous rt-PA is associated with rapid lysis of PE, improved pulmonary perfusion, and improved right ventricular function."

The serum phospholipid composition in patients of the two groups was significantly different. Salmonella gastroenteritis was characterized by reduced LPL and increased PC levels. Acute alcohol gastroenteritis was associated with elevated LPL, PE levels and reduced PC level. Relative LPL, PE levels in salmonella gastroenteritis were significantly higher and PC levels lower than in alcohol gastroenteritis.

Laboratory test revealed elevated D-dimer (1558 ng/mL). The electrocardiogram revealed right axis deviation, S1Q3T3 pattern, and T-wave inversion in leads V1 to V6. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was performed with 64-slice computed tomography for suspicious of pulmonary embolism. Contrast-enhanced CTA showed no filling defect in the pulmonary arteries; however, luminal narrowing of the right pulmonary artery was noted. Nonenhanced computed tomographic scan showed smooth eccentric high attenuation change along the wall of main pulmonary artery and right pulmonary artery and also along the ascending and descending aorta. The high attenuation lesions in both of the aorta and pulmonary artery showed no contrast enhancement indicating presence of intramural hematoma (IMH). Based on the image findings, a diagnosis of type A aortic IMH with pulmonary artery extension, instead of chronic pulmonary embolism, was made. Follow-up CTA 3 months later showed much improved of the right pulmonary artery narrowing and nearly complete resolution of the IMH."

CD010864,0,10984495,0,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase plays an essential role in hypertrophic agonists, endothelin-1 and phenylephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.","The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is activated by hypertrophic stimuli in cardiomyocytes. However, whether ERK plays an essential role or is implicated in all major components of cardiac hypertrophy remains controversial. Using a selective MEK inhibitor, U0126, and a selective Raf inhibitor, SB-386023, to block the ERK signaling pathway at two different levels and adenovirus-mediated transfection of dominant-negative Raf, we studied the role of ERK signaling in response of cultured rat cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic agonists, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and phenylephrine (PE). U0126 and SB-386023 blocked ET-1 and PE-induced ERK but not p38 and JNK activation in cardiomyocytes. Both compounds inhibited ET-1 and PE-induced protein synthesis and increased cell size, sarcomeric reorganization, and expression of beta-myosin heavy chain in myocytes with IC(50) values of 1-2 microm. Furthermore, both inhibitors significantly reduced ET-1- and PE-induced expression of atrial natriuretic factor. In cardiomyocytes transfected with a dominant-negative Raf, ET-1- and PE-induced increase in cell size, sarcomeric reorganization, and atrial natriuretic factor production were remarkably attenuated compared with the cells infected with an adenovirus-expressing green fluorescence protein. Taken together, our data strongly support the notion that the ERK signal pathway plays an essential role in ET-1- and PE-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy."
CD010864,0,10545256,0,Phosphatidylethanolamine recognition promotes enteropathogenic E. coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli host cell attachment.,"Using both solid phase and liposome aggregation assays, we screened a variety of glycolipids and phospholipids and found that EHEC and EPEC bind specifically and in a dose-dependent manner to PE. This binding was consistently observed whether the lipid was immobilized on a thin layer chromatography plate, in a microtitre well or incorporated into a unilamellar vesicle suspended in aqueous solution. There was no evidence of binding to other phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylserine (PS). Bacterial binding to two epithelial cell lines also correlated with the level of outer leaflet PE and was reduced following preincubation with anti-PE. The PE-binding phenotype of EPEC appeared to correlate with the bundle-forming pilus (bfp) genotype of a number of clinical isolates. These results provide evidence of a receptor role for PE in the adhesion of EHEC and EPEC to host cells."

Fifteen patients were randomized into ultrahigh-dose streptokinase (UH-SK n = 8) or alteplase (tPA n = 7) groups. Arterial blood samples were taken before and after thrombolysis every 4 h between 4 and 36 h, and once daily between 2 and 30 days. In-vitro platelet aggregation was examined as spontaneous (0.9% NaCl) and induced aggregation with adrenaline 10 micromol/l, collagen 2 microg/ml and ADP 10 micromol/l. D-dimer and fibrinogen were measured every 8 h on first day, and later as above. In the UH-SK group, adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation decreased at 4 and 8 h compared with baseline (P < 0.03). Adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation was significantly lower in the UH-SK group than in the tPA group at 36 h and on day 3 (P < 0.03). Platelet aggregation induced by ADP was lower at 4 h than at baseline in the UH-SK group (P < 0.05). Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was lower at 4 and 8 h than at baseline (P < 0.05) in the UH-SK group. Compared with baseline, fibrinogen levels decreased in both groups after thrombolysis. D-dimer levels were elevated in both groups at 8 h (tPA group, P < 0.0004; UH-SK group, P < 0.05). Spontaneous platelet aggregation, major bleeding or re-embolism was not documented. Platelet aggregation decreased after thrombolysis with UH-SK for 12 h, in comparison tPA caused an insignificant decrease. Fibrinogen level decreased with UH-SK treatment for 5 days but in case of tPA we could not measure significant changes. According to our findings, tPA is a more suitable drug but streptokinase is also effective because of its cost-benefit ratio."

Discriminant analysis, a statistical procedure, was used to avoid difficulties associated with variation in background color and nonspecific reactions obtained with ELISA with different sera. Specific-pathogen-free pigs were exposed by contact to other specific-pathogen-free pigs which had been inoculated with M hyopneumoniae intratracheally (experiment A) or intranasally (experiment B) 18 to 21 days previously. Sera were collected from each pig before contact exposure and once a week until necropsy. Antibodies were detected by CF at postexposure (PE) week 3 in animals in experiment A (6 of 18) and at PE week 5 in experiment B (3 of 12). The ELISA antibodies were detected at 2 weeks after beginning of contact exposure in experiments A (4 of 18) and B (1 of 12). Examination of pooled data for experiments A and B indicated that ELISA was substantially (P less than 0.05) more sensitive for detection of antibodies than was the CF test at 3 to 5 weeks after contact exposure began. At PE weeks 6 and 7, both tests were similarly effective in detecting M hyopneumoniae antibodies."

One of the phospholipid-binding proteins is beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta 2-GPI), a normal plasma glycoprotein, which under physiological conditions binds with negative charged phospholipids. Measurement of anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies requires specific tests, since ELISA for determination of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) may detect both antibodies directly binding cardiolipin and antibodies against cardiolipin-binding proteins.

In sera obtained from the patients with RA; autoantibodies and RF have been investigated. In SLE cases, ACL antibodies were found to be positive in 55.5% of the patients. In RA cases the rate of ACL antibodies were found to be 51.7%. In SLE cases, the presence of IgG-ACL antibody was found to be in association with thrombosis and fetal loss; while IgM-ACL antibody was found to be in association with fetal loss only. Serologic parameters such as VDRL and AMA type 5 were significantly connected with the presence of ACL-IgG and IgM antibodies (p less than 0.05). In cases of RA connection was detected only between IgG-ACL antibody and thrombosis.

CD010864,0,15226089,0,D-dimer as marker for microcirculatory failure: correlation with LOD and APACHE II scores.,"The relevance of plasma d-dimer levels as marker for morbidity and organ dysfunction in severely ill patients is largely unknown. In a prospective study we determined d-dimer plasma levels of 800 unselected patients at admission to our intensive care unit. In 91% of the patients' samples d-dimer levels were elevated, in some patients up to several hundredfold as compared to normal values. The highest mean d-dimer values were present in the patient group with thromboembolic diseases, and particularly in non-survivors of pulmonary embolism. In patients with circulatory impairment (r=0.794) and in patients with infections (r=0.487) a statistically significant correlation was present between d-dimer levels and the APACHE II score (P<0.001). The logistic organ dysfunction score (LOD, P<0.001) correlated with d-dimer levels only in patients with circulatory impairment (r=0.474). On the contrary, patients without circulatory impairment demonstrated no correlation of d-dimer levels to the APACHE II or LOD score. Taking all patients together, no correlations of d-dimer levels with single organ failure or with indicators of infection could be detected. In conclusion, d-dimer plasma levels strongly correlated with the severity of the disease and organ dysfunction in patients with circulatory impairment or infections suggesting that elevated d-dimer levels may reflect the extent of microcirculatory failure. Thus, a therapeutic strategy to improve the microcirculation in such patients may be monitored using d-dimer plasma levels."

Morphological and functional differences between the visceral endoderm (VE), the founding cell layer, and the parietal endoderm (PE) are presented. During the elongation process, the PE differentiated to fusiform multinucleated cells aligned parallel to the elongation axis of the conceptus, whereas the VE cells retained the aspect of typical epithelial cells. The multinucleated PE cells however, expressed cellular and nuclear markers typical of endodermal and polarized epithelial cells. The proteins of the extracellular matrix, laminin, and fibronectin, were specifically expressed in the PE. The presence of pairs of nuclei linked by mid-bodies positively stained with tubulin antibodies, indicated that the syncytial differentiation of the PE was due to karyokinesis which was not followed by cytokinesis rather than by cell fusion."
CD010864,0,2218975,0,Plasma cross linked fibrin degradation products in pulmonary embolism.,"Plasma concentrations of cross linked fibrin degradation products, a marker of intravascular thrombosis and fibrinolysis, were measured in 495 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism referred for ventilation-perfusion lung scanning to determine whether concentrations are increased in pulmonary embolism and their potential use in diagnosis. Lung scans were described as normal (n = 66) or as showing a low (n = 292), indeterminate (n = 58), or high probability (n = 79) of pulmonary embolism. There was a difference between the mean levels of cross linked fibrin degradation products in each scan category: normal scans, 142 ng/ml; low probability scans, 295 ng/ml; indeterminate probability scans, 510 ng/ml; high probability scans, 952 ng/ml (p less than 0.001). Of the patients with high probability scans, 96% had raised concentrations. Explanations for discrepant low results include incorrect scan diagnosis, delay in blood sampling, and anticoagulation. Of the patients with a low or indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism, 43% had increased concentrations of cross linked fibrin degradation products that could be attributed in most cases to another illness. Owing to the wide range of values in each lung scan diagnostic category, raised concentrations of these fibrin degradation products cannot be used without reference to the patient's clinical state as a discriminatory test for pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation of the significance of normal concentrations in excluding a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism appears to be warranted."

We describe the case of a 29-year-old woman with primary infertility with no history of thrombosis, hypertension or renal disorders. In her first pregnancy, achieved by frozen embryo transfer, she developed severe early-onset (23rd gestational week) PE with heavy proteinuria, and at the same time was found to have enlarged ovaries with hyperreactio luteinalis. After admission we found that she was a heterozygotic carrier of the factor V Leiden mutation. After administering low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy, her blood pressure normalized, proteinuria diminished and her d-dimer values returned to that of a normal pregnant level. The fetus grew normally. Her ovaries normalized during the pregnancy, as determined by ultrasound examinations. At term she delivered spontaneously a normal weight, healthy girl. Previously, only prophylactic LMWH, in subsequent pregnancy, have been administered in patients with thrombophilia and a history of severe PE.

CD010864,0,11202628,0,[D-dimer in the year 2000: current data and new perspectives].,"D-dimer is a product of cross-linked fibrin degradation by the fibrinolytic system. It has been shown to be highly sensitive and moderately specific for venous thromboembolic disease. Thus, the most common clinical use of D-dimer relates to its negative predictive value for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Diagnosis, however, should not be based solely on this parameter, and an integrated strategy that combines clinical approach (pre-test probability), a non-invasive test (ultrasonography or lung scan) and D-dimer assay is highly recommended. Over the last years a number of studies have demonstrated that D-dimer may also enable the prediction of the complications of atherothrombosis inasmuch as the data available suggest a significant association of D-dimer with the risk of coronary artery disease independent of classic risk factors. Moreover, elevated plasma D-dimer seems to be a marker of a systemic prothrombotic state, and anticoagulation can normalize its levels. However, further studies are needed to assess whether or not this parameters is of clinical value to predict or prevent arterial thrombotic events in the single patient."

Cytokines, reactive oxygen intermediates, and reactive nitrogen intermediates are frequently found at sites of acute inflammation. In this study, we measured the levels of interleukin (IL)-8 and nitric oxide (NO) in the periapical exudate (PE) from human periapical lesions and investigated the association of these mediators with the clinical symptoms of periapical periodontitis. PE samples were collected from root canals during routine endodontic treatments. The IL-8 concentration was measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the NO level was measured as nitrite/nitrate concentration assayed by the Griess reaction. Detectable levels of IL-8 and nitrite/nitrate were found in 24 and 19 of 27 PE-samples, respectively. Although PE-IL-8 and nitrite/nitrate concentration showed a broad range, a significantly positive correlation was found between both mediators. Also, significantly higher IL-8 levels were found in PE from lesions that had painful symptoms at the sampling visit. However, there was no relationship between elevated NO levels and clinical symptoms. These results suggest that the up-regulation of IL-8 may have a critical role in the development of the symptoms of periapical disease."
CD010864,0,9699938,0,Diagnostic accuracy of Doppler-echocardiography in unselected patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"This study investigates the diagnostic value of echocardiography in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Doppler-echocardiography was performed in fifty consecutive patients, predominantly presenting in the emergency ward, with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism. Patients were classified as having or not pulmonary embolism by a sequential non-invasive strategy including lung scan, D-dimer measurement and lower limb venous compression ultrasonography, pulmonary angiography being performed in case of an inconclusive non-invasive work-up. The prevalence of pulmonary embolism was 36% (18 of 50 patients). Right ventricular dilatation on 2-D echocardiography associated to a tricuspid regurgitation velocity > or =2.7 m/s, corresponding to a pulmonary systolic pressure > or =39 mmHg, were present in 12 of the 18 patients (67%) with and in two of the 32 patients (6.3%) without pulmonary embolism. They were, however, absent in five of the 18 patients (28%), in whom the definite diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made. The combination of these both echocardiographic criteria yielded a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 94%, positive predictive value was 86% and negative predictive value was 83%. The diagnostic performance of these two combined echocardiographic criteria, when present, permitted to reach in patients with a high clinical pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism the post-test probability values above 90%. On the other hand, the absence of these two Doppler-echocardiographic criteria did not allow to exclude pulmonary embolism, except in presence of a low pre-test probability. The findings of our study show that Doppler-echocardiography in patients with high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism may represent a potentially useful screening technique for the diagnosis of the disease permitting prompt initiation of treatment. However, the method does not allow to exclude pulmonary embolism in all patients with intermediate or high clinical suspicion of the disease."

CD010864,0,18471966,0,Performance optimization of coagulation/flocculation in the treatment of wastewater from a polyvinyl chloride plant.,"This paper presents results of an experimental study of coagulation/flocculation process of wastewater generated from a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plant. The wastewater contains fine chlorine-based solid materials (i.e. latex). Experiments were carried out using a model wastewater which is chemically identical to the actual plant but is more consistent. Inorganic ions (Al2(SO4)3, FeCl3 and CaCl2) and a water soluble commercial polyelectrolyte (PE) were added to the wastewater sample. Coagulation efficiency was determined by measuring both the turbidity of the supernatants and the relative settlement of the flocs in the jar test. It was found that aluminum and ferric ions were more efficient than calcium ions as coagulants. The addition of polyelectrolyte was found to improve substantially the coagulation/flocculation process. It was found that the (Al2(SO4)3) combined with the polyelectrolyte at certain pH and agitation speed gave the best results compared to calcium chloride or ferric chloride when combined with the same concentration of polyelectrolyte. Only 0.0375g of a solution of (0.5% Al2(SO4)3) was required to coagulate the model wastewater. Ferric chloride (2.5% FeCl3) combined with the polyelectrolyte, on the other hand, required 0.1g while the optimum turbidity is almost the same. As for calcium chloride (2.5% CaCl2) it was found to be the least effective. The coagulation/flocculation process was found to be dependent on both pH and the agitation speed."

The individual risk is nearly unpredictable. A daily single dose of a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administered as prophylaxis to 518 trauma patients who were examined preoperatively and up to 10 days postoperatively in a prospective study. They were divided into two groups: group I comprised surgery of the hip and femur as well as total knee replacement and group II knee and lower leg surgery. Thrombin-antithrombin complex and D-dimer were analyzed. A second daily dose of LMWH was added if D-dimer exceeded the cutoff. If ultrasound was suspicious for DVT venography was added. Deep vein thrombosis was seen in five cases (group I=4, group II=1), without pulmonary embolism. TAT and D-dimer were significantly higher in group I than in group II ( p<0.005). One hundred patients, 79 of them belonging to group I, were treated with a second dose of LMWH. The daily cutoff had the highest sensitivity and specificity for day 4. Due to individual monitoring of coagulation markers, the risk for thromboembolism compared to actual data in the literature seems to be reduced."

Seventy-nine consecutive patients with undiagnosed unilateral PE were enrolled. Pleural VEGF levels, measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were correlated to etiology of PEs and other markers (protein, lactic dehydrogenase, amylase, glucose). The median level of VEGF in exudates (n=65) was significantly higher than that in transudates (P=0.0001) and among exudates, it was significantly higher in malignant (n=49) than that in benign exudates (P=0.005). No significant differences were observed between malignant effusions due to lung cancer (n=11) and other malignant effusions [mesothelioma (n=13) and/or extra-thoracic cancer]. Among all variables evaluated, logistic regression found that only VEGF was significantly correlated with the presence of malignant disease (P=0.002). Analysis of the receiver operating characterists (ROC) curves showed that the areas under the curve of VEGF were significantly larger than that of amylase (P=0.02), glucose (P=0.01), lactic dehydrogenase (P=0.001) and protein (P=0.01). VEGF increased the diagnostic rate of cytological examination by 24%. VEGF may represent a helpful adjunct to conventional diagnostic tools in ruling out malignancy as a probable diagnosis, thus guiding the selection of patients who might benefit from further invasive procedures."
CD010864,0,3896298,0,Serum crosslinked fibrin (XDP) and fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (FDP) in disorders associated with activation of the coagulation or fibrinolytic systems.,"Soluble crosslinked fibrin derivatives (XDP) in serum were determined by enzyme immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies and compared with serum fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (FDP) assayed by conventional techniques. In healthy subjects and patients with miscellaneous disorders not usually associated with activation of the haemostasis mechanism, mean XDP levels were 45 and 70 ng/ml respectively. However, elevated levels of XDP occurred in conditions commonly associated with intravascular and possibly extravascular activation of the coagulation system. Markedly raised mean XDP values (677-6900 ng/ml) occurred in treated pulmonary embolism, disseminated neoplasia, severe inflammatory disorders and complicated postoperative states, and lesser but significant elevation (mean 150-400 ng/ml) in treated venous thrombosis, uneventful postsurgical states, localized neoplasia, liver disease and symptomatic arterial disease. Levels during initial streptokinase therapy (mean 24 000 ng/ml) fell tenfold as treatment was continued. The degree of XDP elevation over normal values was significantly higher than that of FDP in conditions with a propensity for venous thrombosis (post-operative states, disseminated neoplasia and inflammatory diseases) than in liver disease, localized neoplasia or patients receiving heparin therapy for venous thromboembolism."
CD010864,0,12362542,0,"[The SBU on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of thrombosis: New methods critically scrutinized].","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) causes more than 1,000 deaths and leads to the admission to hospital of 11,000 patients each year in Sweden. Prevention of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is therefore of great importance. Diagnosis is difficult as the symptom profile is diffuse and difficult to interpret. Acute treatment and secondary prophylaxis are complicated as the risk of severe bleeding is great. A systematic review was carried out of the literature on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of VTE. Only randomized controlled studies were included and, to assess diagnostic methods, only studies with an independent comparison with a known reference method. Approximately 1,300 scientific studies met the requirements for high scientific quality. The scientific evidence strongly suggests that low molecular weight heparin can replace unfractionated heparin in preventing and treating venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Treatment with a single daily injection, rather than two, of low molecular weight heparin yields equally favorable effects. The risk for hemorrhage is lower with low molecular weight heparin and management is simpler, which facilitates outpatient treatment. Longer-term secondary prophylaxis with warfarin reduces the risk for relapse, but several years of treatment also increases the risk for severe hemorrhage. The presence of treatment-demanding VTE can be excluded in outpatients by combining the assessment of clinical probability, using clinical decision rules, with measurement of D-dimer. Thorough ultrasonic examination of the leg and a CT scan of the pulmonary vessels usually provide sufficient diagnostic reliability, which strongly supports the use of these methods in clinical practice. It is not meaningful to conduct extensive investigations of patients with venous thrombosis to find possible underlying cancer. It is essential to develop more cost-effective methods to investigate genetic predisposition for thrombosis."

CD010864,0,12931634,0,[A case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy showing coagulation cascade activation induced by muscle destruction due to convulsion].,"A male patient with advanced Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) had tonic-clonic convulsion. He showed transient elevations of serum creatine kinase (CK) and plasma D-dimer. Serum CK, ordinarily 122-386 IU/l, was elevated to 9,262 IU/l, while plasma D-dimer, below 66 ng/ml in normal subjects, was at 543 ng/ml, and these levels were significantly correlated. Serum fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products levels were within a normal range. In the present case, acute muscle destruction due to tonic-clonic convulsion was considered to transiently activate a coagulation cascade. Plasma D-dimer elevation is the result of fibrin thrombus and can induce thrombosis, such as a pulmonary embolism. Thrombosis is a serious life-threatening complication of DMD, though the mechanism remains unclear. There were no thrombotic complications in the present patient, however, acute muscle destruction enhances the coagulation and fibrinolysis status in patients with advanced DMD and may be a candidate cause of thrombosis."
CD010864,0,22959546,0,Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: Advances and pitfalls.,"The signs and symptoms of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) form a wide spectrum and considerably overlap with other cardiopulmonary diseases. Timely recognizing of this disease therefore remains challenging, but is of vital importance to avoid PE-related morbidity and mortality. To aid and standardize the initial diagnostic approach of patients with suspected PE, clinical probability rules have been developed and simplified for use in clinical practice. It has been demonstrated by clinical outcome studies that it is safe and of high clinical utility to exclude PE on the basis of an unlikely clinical probability and a normal D-dimer test result. For the remaining patients with suspected PE, imaging tests are required. The introduction of multi-detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (MD-CTA) has significantly improved the detection of PE, and this test is now regarded as the imaging test of first choice. This review will focus on recent advances and pitfalls that remain in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected acute PE."

Another five animals served as controls. At time=0, 30, 60, 120, 240 min, circulating arterial plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), its precursor big ET-1, and thromboxane (Tx), were measured by RIA and EIA, respectively, along with hemodynamics and blood gases. The data showed that following APAE, there was a rapid increase in MPAP and a persistent decrease in Pa(O(2)), while the mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output remained comparable. Plasma levels of ET-1, big ET-1 and Tx were also increased steadily in these first 4 h. These results showed that during APAE, the resulted changes in the pulmonary vascular and airway tones mediated by these potent mediators could explain the observed pulmonary hypertension and the deterioration of gas exchange."

CD010864,0,18495151,0,Copper reverses cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated reduction in the cell size.,"Previous studies have shown that dietary copper supplementation reversed heart hypertrophy induced by pressure overload in a mouse model. The present study was undertaken to understand the cellular basis of copper-induced regression of cardiac hypertrophy. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with phenylephrine (PE) at a final concentration of 100 microM in cultures for 48 h to induce cellular hypertrophy. The hypertrophied cardiomyocytes were exposed to copper sulfate at a final concentration of 5 microM in cultures for additional 24 h. This copper treatment reduced the size of the hypertrophied cardiomyocytes, as measured by flow cytometry, protein content in cells, cell volume and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy markers including beta-myosin heavy chain protein, skeletal alpha-actin, and atrial natriuretic peptide. Cell cycle analysis and cell sorting of p-histone-3 labeled cardiomyocytes indicated that cell division was not involved in the copper-induced regression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Copper also inhibited PE-induced apoptosis, determined by a TUNEL assay. Because copper stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production through activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, an anti-VEGF antibody at a final concentration of 2 ng/ml in cultures was used and shown to blunt copper-induced regression of cell hypertrophy. Conversely, VEGF alone at a final concentration of 0.2 microg/ml reversed cell hypertrophy as the same as copper did. This study demonstrates that both copper and VEGF reduce the size of hypertrophied cardiomyocytes, and copper regression of cardiac hypertrophy is VEGF-dependent."

We aimed at assessing the diagnostic performance of compression ultrasonography as compared to multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) for the diagnosis of PE. We analyzed data from a large outcome management study that included consecutive outpatients referred to the emergency ward with clinically suspected PE. All high clinical probability patients, and all non-high clinical probability patients with a positive D-dimer test underwent both MSCT and CUS. Of the 756 included patients, 232 had PE ruled out on the basis of a negative D-dimer test, and 524 patients underwent both MSCT and CUS. PE was found in 187 out of the 511 patients with a conclusive MSCT. The sensitivity of CUS for the presence of PE on MSCT was 39% (95% confidence interval: 32 to 46%), and its specificity was 99% (95% CI:97 to 100%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 42.2 (95% CI: 13.5 to 131.9) and 0.6 (95% CI: 0.5 to 0.7), respectively. We conclude from that large study of unselected patients that CUS has high specificity but low sensitivity, for the diagnosis of PE at MSCT in suspected patients. It allows ruling in the diagnosis of PE without further invasive and/or expensive testing in suspected patients."

Clinical findings and non-specific laboratory tests are usually insufficient to rule out VTE. Due to high costs, higher complication rates, and other reasons, the ""gold standard"" tests for VTE (pulmonary angiography or contrast venography) are usually unavailable and are seldom used by most physicians in the EDs. The end result is an extensive use of the non-invasive Imaging modalities and yet under-diagnosis of VTE. The purpose of this review is to describe the advanced non-invasive methods currently available for the diagnosis of VTE and to define the role of the rapid d-dimer assay.

We hypothesized that cardiac troponins offer useful prognostic information regarding morbidity and mortality in elderly hip fracture patients undergoing surgical therapy. A literature review was conducted using PubMed and CINAHL plus with full text (EBSCOhost). Articles with original data relating troponins to prognosis in elderly hip fracture patients were reviewed. Studies with patients not undergoing surgery or undergoing elective or nonhip fracture surgery were excluded. Six papers met inclusion criteria. Troponin elevation was seen in 26.7-39% of patients, while myocardial infarction, cardiac complications, and cardiac death occurred in â¤35% troponin-positive patients in four of six studies. Several noncardiac factors were associated with elevated troponin including higher American Society of Anaesthesiologists score, current smoking, reduced mobility/activity level, lower hemoglobin, and living in residential care. Patients with elevated troponin had longer lengths of stay, increased risk for discharge to long-term care facilities, and higher mortality. Increased age, male sex, and higher American Society of Anaesthesiologists score were also associated with mortality. Elevated troponin can be used as a marker of increased morbidity/mortality in elderly hip fracture patients undergoing surgery, as hypothesized, even in the absence of cardiac complications. Perioperative troponin evaluation may be useful for risk stratification, but further studies are needed to clarify risks and benefits of such testing."
CD010864,0,7543897,0,Characterization of the antigenic specificity of four different anti-(alpha 2-->8-linked polysialic acid) antibodies using lipid-conjugated oligo/polysialic acids.,"A rapid, sensitive, and facile method for screening and characterizing anti-polysialic acid (polySia) antibodies using lipid-conjugated oligo/polysialic acids (oligo/polySia) was developed, which is based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Homooligo/polymers of alpha 2-->8-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), N-glycoly-neuraminic acid, and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) were conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine dipalmitoyl (PE) by reductive amination to prepare neo-oligo/polysialoglycolipids (oligo/polySia-PE). Using this method, the anti-polySia equine antibody, H.46, bound to (-->8Neu5Ac alpha 2-->)n-PE, where n = 9 or more residues, a result in confirmation of previous binding studies using radiolabeled oligo/polyNeu5Ac. The antigenic specificity and sensitivity of two monoclonal anti-poly/oligoNeu5Ac antibodies (mAb.12E3 and mAb.5A5) and one anti-oligoKDN antibody (mAb.kdn8kdn), were also determined. mAb.12E3 could detect as little as 25 pg/well of oligo/polyNeu5Ac-PE, while 0.4 ng/well of oligo/polyNeu5Ac-PE to be detected. mAb.kdn8kdn detected as little as 12 ng/well of oligoKDN-PE. Using a series of oligo/polySia-PE with defined degrees of polymerization (DP), the minimum chain length for immunoreactivity of the anti-polySia antibodies was determined to be: DP 5 for mAb.12E3; DP 3 for mAb.5A5; DP 2 for mAb.kdn8kdn; and DP 8 for H.46. Thus, mAb.12E3 and mAb.5A5 recognize shorter oligomers of Neu5Ac than H.46, a finding that is of practical value for identifying shorter oligoSia chains in glycoconjugates. Because mAb.12E3 and mAb.5A5 also recognize extended polySia chains, these antibodies cannot be used, however, to differentiate between short and long chains of polySia when both are expressed on the same molecule."

CD010864,0,11005461,0,Current diagnostic techniques for pulmonary embolism.,"The diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and requires objective testing. The clinician uses a combination of risk factors and nonspecific clinical findings to identify patients who warrant such an evaluation. The recommended approach begins with ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scans or lower extremity noninvasive studies by compression ultrasonography. Nondiagnostic V/Q scans or negative noninvasive studies require further testing. A high-probability V/Q scan or a positive noninvasive study warrant treatment. A normal V/Q scan excludes the diagnosis of PE. Helical computed tomography (CT) can diagnose PE of major vessels but is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude PE because of its poor sensitivity for subsegmental pulmonary vessels. Newer D-dimer assays have a high negative predictive value, but results vary with the specific assay and do not perform well in patients with cancer.

In view of the possible association between clear cell histology and VTE in endometrial cancer, we measured the plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) and D-dimer (DD) in the preoperative examinations of a patient with clear cell adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Plasma TAT and DD were both highly elevated, though the patient had no symptoms of VTE or risk factors such as obesity or diabetes mellitus. Ultrasound Doppler examination and lung perfusion scintigraphy just before surgery revealed a thrombosis in the left popliteal vein and a pulmonary embolism. After implanting an inferior vena cava filter to prevent a fatal embolism of the lung, we performed abdominal total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and sampling of the pelvic lymph nodes. The VTE gradually disappeared and the plasma levels of TAT and DD returned to normal after surgery. Possibly, the VTE in this patient may have been associated with the clear cell histology."

Given this knowledge and the encouraging preliminary pediatric experience with systemic thrombolysis, we sought to retrospectively analyze our institutional experience with a thrombolytic regimen versus standard anticoagulation for acute, occlusive deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the proximal lower extremities in children in whom plasma factor VIII activity and/or D-dimer concentration were elevated at diagnosis, from within a longitudinal pediatric cohort. Nine children who underwent the thrombolytic regimen and 13 who received standard anticoagulation alone were followed from time of diagnosis with serial clinical evaluation and standardized PTS outcome assessments conducted in uniform fashion. The thrombolytic regimen was associated with a markedly decreased odds of PTS at 18 to 24 months compared with standard anticoagulation alone, which persisted after adjustment for significant covariates of age and lag time to therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.018, 95% confidence interval [CI] = < 0.001-0.483; P = .02). Major bleeding developed in 1 child, clinically judged as not directly related to thrombolysis for DVT. These findings suggest that the use of a thrombolysis regimen may safely and substantially reduce the risk of PTS in children with occlusive lower-extremity acute DVT, providing the basis for a future clinical trial."

CD010864,0,20837474,0,Src homology 3-interacting domain of Rv1917c of Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces selective maturation of human dendritic cells by regulating PI3K-MAPK-NF-kappaB signaling and drives Th2 immune responses.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an etiological agent of pulmonary tuberculosis, causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pathogenic mycobacteria survive in the host by subverting host innate immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that are vital for eliciting immune responses to infectious agents, including pathogenic mycobacteria. DCs orchestrate distinct Th responses based on the signals they receive. In this perspective, deciphering the interactions of the proline-glutamic acid/proline-proline-glutamic acid (PE/PPE) family of proteins of M. tuberculosis with DCs assumes significant pathophysiological attributes. In this study, we demonstrate that Rv1917c (PPE34), a representative member of the proline-proline-glutamic-major polymorphic tandem repeat family, interacts with TLR2 and triggers functional maturation of human DCs. Signaling perturbations implicated a critical role for integrated cross-talk among PI3K-MAPK and NF-ÎºB signaling cascades in Rv1917c-induced maturation of DCs. However, this maturation of DCs was associated with a secretion of high amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, whereas Th1-polarizing cytokine IL-12 was not induced. Consistent with these results, Rv1917c-matured DCs favored secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 from CD4(+) T cells and contributed to Th2-skewed cytokine balance ex vivo in healthy individuals and in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Interestingly, the Rv1917c-skewed Th2 immune response involved induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in DCs. Taken together, these results indicate that Rv1917c facilitates a shift in the ensuing immunity toward the Th2 phenotype and could aid in immune evasion by mycobacteria."

CD010864,0,14742615,0,Isolated pulmonary arteriovenous fistula without Rendu-Osler-Weber disease as a cause of cryptogenic stroke.,"There has been uncertainty as to whether a right to left shunt through an isolated pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (P-AVF) without Rendu-Osler-Weber (ROW) disease can cause paradoxical brain embolism. A population of 747 acute ischaemic stroke patients was examined to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of those patients who had an isolated P-AVF. The presence of a P-AVF was determined as follows. On patients with a stroke of undetermined cause, both transoesophageal echocardiography and transcranial Doppler with saline contrast medium was performed to detect a right to left shunt. If a P-AVF was then suspected, selective pulmonary angiography and enhanced chest CT was performed to confirm the presence of the P-AVF. Four patients (0.5%) were diagnosed as having a stroke associated with an isolated P-AVF. All the patients were middle-aged women (mean age 61 years). In all these patients, the P-AVF could not have been suspected on physical findings or chest x ray. The P-AVF was always single and located in the lower lobe. All the patients had asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis, and three patients developed pulmonary embolism. As D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complex were elevated in all patients, this indicated an activation of both fibrinolytic and thrombin activity. Our results show that an isolated P-AVF without ROW disease can cause paradoxical brain embolism. Thus, the existence of an isolated P-AVF as a right to left shunt in patients with a stroke of unknown origin should not be overlooked, even if a P-AVF is not suggested by the initial physical findings or chest x ray."
CD010864,0,19840681,0,Perspectives on cost and outcomes for point-of-care testing.,"Point-of-care testing (POCT) is usually more expensive on a unit-cost basis than testing performed in a central laboratory. It is difficult to manage POCT and to maintain regulatory compliance, especially in large institutions. However, some POCT technologies have improved patient outcomes (patient self-glucose monitoring in the home, tight glycemic control in intensive care settings) or hospital or emergency department operations (whole-blood cardiac-marker testing and D-dimer testing in emergency departments). In some cases, these outcomes result simply from making a new test available, rather than performing the test at the point of care. In most cases, the rapid turnaround time provided by POCT is the main factor that is ultimately responsible for the improvement in outcomes."

CD010864,0,12111773,0,"Bone marrow necrosis with dyspnea in a patient with malignant lymphoma and plasma levels of thrombomodulin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and D-dimer.","Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (peripheral T cell, unspecified, clinical stage IIIEA) was diagnosed in a 54-year-old male. He was treated weekly with chemotherapy consisting of pirarubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, vincristine sulfate, etoposide, and prednisolone. After 6 weeks of treatment in a state of partial remission, he exhibited sudden dyspnea, chest pain, fever, and drowsiness. The patient had received 100 microg/day of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for 6 days before the onset. Laboratory data showed an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, leukoerythroblastosis in the peripheral blood, and no decrease in the serum haptoglobin level. There were no findings of acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary thromboembolism. Bone marrow specimen showed the characteristic features of necrosis without any signs of the involvement of lymphoma cells. No indications of infections were found. This patient was diagnosed as having bone marrow necrosis (BMN) during the recovery phase of bone marrow with G-CSF treatment after chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma. After conservative therapy, inhalation of oxygen and stopping the administration of G-CSF, all clinical symptoms subsided except that the elevation of LDH continued for 1 month. The plasma level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was high just after the onset of BMN. The thrombomodulin (TM) level was high just before the onset of BMN and continued to be high for 2 weeks. Cross-linked fibrin degradation products (D-dimer) were also high just after the onset of BMN and continued to be high for 3 weeks after the onset. Although dyspnea is a rare symptom of BMN, it is important to rule out in BMN during the recovery phase of bone marrow with G-CSF treatment after chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma. Activated neutrophils in the small vessels of the lung by G-CSF and microthrombi, suggested by the elevation of D-dimer, may participate in the onset of dyspnea, which is a rare symptom of the onset of BMN."

CD010864,0,7927788,0,Primate antibody response to immunotoxin: serological and computer-aided analysis of epitopes on a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin.,"NLysPE38 is a 38-kDa derivative of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) in which domain Ia (amino acids 1 to 252) and part of domain Ib (365 to 380) are deleted and an 11-amino-acid N-terminal peptide is added. LMB-1 is an immunotoxin in which the monoclonal antibody B3 is coupled to NLysPE38 near its N terminus. LMB-7 is a single-chain immunotoxin in which the Fv fragment of B3 is fused to PE38. To identify the antigenic regions of PE38, 12 polyclonal serum samples from monkeys immunized with the immunotoxins LMB-1 (six monkeys) and LMB-7 (six monkeys) were tested for their reactivity to a panel of 120 synthetic, overlapping peptides representing the amino acid sequence of NLysPE38. The antibody responses to peptides were similar among the 12 serum specimens, identifying several major immunodominant B-cell epitopes. Predominant reactivity was seen in six locations: amino acids 272 to 287, 341 to 359, 504 to 516, 540 to 564, and 573 to 591 and the C-terminal amino acids 591 to 613. The sera did not react with approximately 75% of the peptides. Furthermore, a computer-aided analysis was done to predict the immunologically relevant areas and revealed the same antigenic regions defined by serum reactivity to peptides. Competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and neutralization assays were performed with domain II, III, or III plus Ib of PE38 and confirmed the immunodominance of domain III. To analyze the role of specific amino acids in antibody binding, individual amino acids of PE38 with large accessible surface areas were altered by site-directed mutagenesis. These results also show that the predicted areas of immunogenicity agree with the reactivity of the anti-PE38 antibodies to peptides and to the mutants of PE."
CD010864,0,10871436,0,Detection of elastase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum and its potential role in epithelial cell permeability.,"Most clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce elastase, a zinc metalloprotease that is implicated in the pathogenesis of infections related to these organisms. To better understand the physiologic role of this protease in the regulation of airway permeability, we developed a panel of specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against purified Pseudomonas elastase (PE) that do not react with either neutrophil elastase or porcine pancreatic elastase. These mAbs were used in a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the concentrations of PE in sputum samples from patients with pulmonary infections. Sputum from patients infected with P. aeruginosa showed a varying amount of PE, whereas others indicated no signals. We also found that the mAbs blocked the effect of PE on epithelial barrier function in vitro on the basis of measurement of transmonolayer electrical resistance of polarized epithelial cells as an index of paracellular permeability."

CD010864,0,18551776,0,"Foot and mouth disease in the Borana pastoral system, southern Ethiopia and implications for livelihoods and international trade.","Participatory epidemiology (PE) was used on the Borana plateau of southern Ethiopia to understand pastoralist's perceptions of the clinical and epidemiological features of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in cattle. Matrix scoring showed good agreement between informant groups on the clinical signs of acute and chronic FMD, and findings were cross-checked by clinical examination of cattle and assessment of previous clinical FMD at herd level by detection of antibody to non structural proteins of FMD virus. The positive predictive value of pastoralist's diagnosis of FMD at herd level was 93.1%. The annual age-specific incidence and mortality of acute FMD in 50 herds was estimated using proportional piling. The estimated mean incidence of acute FMD varied from in 18.5% in cattle less than two years of age to 14.0% in cattle three to four years of age. The estimated mean mortality due to acute FMD varied from 2.8% in cattle less than two years of age to 0.3% in cattle three of age or older. Pearson correlation coefficients for acute FMD by age group were -0.12 (p>0.05) for incidence and -0.59 (p<0.001) for mortality. Estimates of the annual incidence of chronic FMD varied from 0.2% in cattle less than two years of age to 1.8% in cattle three to four years of age. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the incidence of chronic FMD by age group was 0.47 (p<0.001). Outbreaks of FMD peaked in Borana cattle during the two dry seasons and were attributed to increased cattle movement to dry season grazing areas. The mean seroprevalence of FMD was estimated at 21% (n=920) and 55.2% of herds (n=116) tested seropositive. Serotyping of 120 seropositive samples indicated serotypes O (99.2%), A (95.8%), SAT 2 (80%) and C (67.5%). The endemic nature of FMD in Borana pastoral herds is discussed in terms of the direct household-level impact of the disease, and the increasing export of cattle and chilled beef from Ethiopia."
CD010864,0,15316758,0,Impaired fibrinolytic potential related to elevated alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism.,"The contribution of neutrophil leukocyte elastase (NE) to in vivo thrombolysis is still an open question. The present study examines the impact of variable levels of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha1-PI) (the major plasma inhibitor of NE) on fibrinolysis within the setting of thromboembolic diseases. Blood samples were taken from 56 patients with pulmonary thromboembolism prior to treatment. alpha1-PI and alpha1-PI-NE complex were measured in the serum and plasma with immunoturbidimetric and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods, respectively. The fibrinolytic potential [spontaneous, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) induced, and plasmin induced] of the plasma was evaluated in vitro with turbidimetric clot lysis assay. Correlation analysis (Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, r) of the turbidimetric lysis parameters and the blood levels of alpha1-PI and alpha1-PI-NE complex was carried out. Fibrinolysis is slower in clots prepared from plasma containing elevated levels of alpha1-PI and alpha1-PI-NE complex. The maximal turbidity of the plasma clots shows significant correlation with the alpha1-PI level (r=0.39, p=0.003) and the correlation of the maximal turbidity and the tPA-induced lysis time is also significant (r=0.77, p<0.001). The lysis time correlates with the plasma level of alpha1-PI-NE complex, if fibrinolysis is induced with tPA (r=0.37, p=0.02), but not with plasmin (r=0.19, p=0.4). Our study shows that in pulmonary thromboembolism elevated levels of alpha1-PI are associated with suppressed plasma fibrinolytic potential. This effect can be at least partially explained by the coarse fibrin network structure and retarded plasminogen activator-dependent fibrinolysis."

CD010864,0,7369813,0,Reticuloendothelial clearance of blood-borne particulates: relevance to experimental lung microembolization and vascular injury.,"The rapid increase in sheep lung vascular permeability observed during Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia may be due to embolization of the pulmonary microvasculature by bloodborne particulates. Since alterations in lung microvascular permeability during mild septicemia in sheep may reflect inefficient RES phagocytic clearance of bacteria as well as products of bacterial induced intravascular coagulation, the opsonic and phagocytic aspects of RES function in sheep (30-50 kg) were compared to other species. RES function was evaluated by both the clearance and relative organ uptake of gelatinized I(131) RE test lipid emulsion and gelatinized colloidal carbon. Immunoreactive opsonic a(2)SB glycoprotein levels were determined by electroimmunoassay. The phagocytic index for RES clearance of the gelatinized (500 mg/kg) test lipid in sheep was 0.019 +/- 0.002 corresponding to a half-time of 16.65 +/- 1.74 minutes. With colloidal carbon (64 mg/kg), the phagocytic index in sheep was 0.080 +/- 0.026, corresponding to a half-time of 6.16 +/- 1.99 minutes. The per cent of injected lipid emulsion (%ID) in major RE organs, on a total organ basis (TO), was: liver = 15.69 +/- 1.65%; spleen = 2.09 +/- 0.78%. Localization in the lung = 31.39 +/- 6.2%. The per cent of carbon localized in major RE organs (%ID/TO) was: liver = 21.37 +/- 1.9%; spleen = 1.95 +/- 0.55%. Localization in the lung = 32.70 +/- 4.55%. In contrast, clearance and organ distribution of the blood-borne test microparticles in rats and dogs at the same relative challenging dose revealed a much more intense and rapid liver and spleen RES uptake with minimal lung localization (1-2%). Immunoreactive opsonic protein concentrations varied greatly with species and directly correlated with efficiency of RES function. Levels observed were: dog = 1285 +/- 135 microg/ml; mouse = 1077 +/- 67 microg/ml; rat = 400 +/- 31 microg/ml; human = 297 +/- 10 microg/ml; and sheep = 184 +/- 13 microg/ml. After intravenous particulate challenge, circulating immunoreactive opsonic protein in the sheep was depleted (p < 0.05) rapidly with partial recovery at 24 hours and mild rebound hyperopsonemia at 48 hours. This pattern is in contrast to the rapid restoration seen in dog and rat within three to six hours postchallenge. Thus, in sheep, the extensive pulmonary localization of blood-borne microparticles appears related to inefficient RES clearance function mediated by a relative deficiency of circulating opsonic protein (plasma fibronectin)."
CD010864,0,9651477,0,"Lipid interactions with human antiphospholipid antibody, beta 2-glycoprotein 1, and normal human IgG using the fluorescent probes NBD-PE and DPH.","Recurrent venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis and pregnancy losses are clinical manifestation associated with antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) that recognizes negatively charged phospholipid antigens. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are generally used to determine the presence and specificity of aPL. In this paper, a fluorescence spectroscopy method has been applied, through monitoring the alteration of fluorescence intensity and anisotropy of a fluorophore that was incorporated in liposomes to explore the changes of molecular structure or configuration elicited by the binding aPL with phospholipid antigens. The bilayer surface was markedly ordered by aPL binding as indicated by the surface-sensitive probe NBD-PE. The binding of aPL on the bilayer surface is saturable. The saturation concentration of aPL is 40% (w/w, aPL/lipid) for cardiolipin membranes. The binding of aPL on cardiolipin took place in the absence of beta 2-GP1. The addition of beta 2-GP1 further increased the anisotropy and decreased the intensity of fluorescence. The binding of aPL is predominantly attributed to electrostatic interaction, but the configuration of the acyl chains of phospholipid also plays a role. It is found that the thermal history is important for aPL binding. The incubation at 37 degrees C is more favorable for aPL binding than ambient temperature. Normal human serine (IgG-NHS) did not elicit any distinct change of NBD-PE fluorescence, which indicates it does not interact with the lipid."

The purified PP-13 was lysed to peptides, which were sequenced, leading to the full-length cDNA sequencing and its expression in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis in databases showed homology to the galectin family. Of the various antibody preparations developed, a pair of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) coupled to the recombinant PP-13 (PP-13-R) was used for the immunodetection of PP-13 in pregnant women's serum with the solid-phase ELISA format. With a dynamic range of 25-500 pg/mL with no background in non-pregnant women's serum and men's serum, the ELISA test was suitable for the detection of PP-13 in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters. PP-13 levels slowly increase during pregnancy. In the 1st trimester, lower than normal PP-13 levels were found in fetal growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia (PE), and particularly in early PE (<34 weeks of gestation). In the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, higher than normal concentrations were found in PE, IUGR and in preterm delivery (PTD). Application of PP-13 to cultured trophoblasts elicited depolarization carried by calcium ions, followed by liberation of linoleic and arachidonic acids from the trophoblast membrane, and a subsequent elevation of prostacyclin and thromboxane. These effects were negligible when PP-13 derived from the placentas of patients with IUGR, PE or PTD was used. The results are discussed in view of the potential utilization of PP-13 for early serum screening to assess the risk to develop placental insufficiency, coupled to a differential analysis of the various pathologies by analyzing cultured trophoblasts."

However, patients with malignant disorders are subject to an especially high risk of deep venous thrombosis progressing in severe cases to subsequent pulmonary embolism. The present study focuses on appraising modern markers of deep vein thrombosis in 34 patients undergoing major maxillofacial surgery, with some malignant disorders. No significant differences between the two patient groups were noted using the markers of the kallikrein-kinin-system. From the first postoperative day plasma levels of the coagulation indicator thrombin-antithrombin-III complexes were significantly higher in the group of tumour patients. Markers of fibrinolysis indicated corresponding results: on the first postoperative day tissue-plasminogen activator values rose to 18.9 +/- 3.2 micrograms/l in the group of malignant patients, but only to 7.4 +/- 1.1 micrograms/l (P < 0.05) in the control group. Also postoperative D-dimer concentrations in the malignancy group were significantly above those of the control group. In the present study it could be demonstrated that patients with malignant neoplasia undergoing major maxillofacial surgery are exposed postoperatively to a particularly high risk of developing thromboembolic complications. All in all, the status of anti-thrombotic therapy requires reappraisal with respect to the current treatment approach adopted in tumour patients."

CD010864,0,7896225,0,The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Although clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is not sufficiently reliable to determine management, it is valuable for stratifying patients into high, intermediate, and low clinical suspicion of embolism. Clinical assessment can then be combined with lung scanning to identify groups of patients with a sufficiently high or low probability of PE that a decision to anticoagulate or withhold therapy can be made. Approximately half of patients with suspected PE will fall into one of these categories. Thrombosis in the deep veins of the leg (DVT) can be detected by noninvasive tests in approximately 50%, and by bilateral venography in approximately 70% of patients with PE, and provides grounds for anticoagulation of some patients with nondiagnostic combinations of clinical and lung scan assessments. Failure to detect DVT makes it less likely but does not exclude the possibility that the patient had a PE. Preliminary evidence suggests that the majority of patients with nondiagnostic combinations of clinical assessment, lung scanning, and negative noninvasive tests for DVT can safely be managed without anticoagulation, provided serial noninvasive tests for DVT remain normal over a 2-week period. Pulmonary angiography may be advisable in patients with nondiagnostic combinations of the above tests in whom (a) the probability of PE remains high (e.g. 30-80%), (b) cardiopulmonary reserve is poor, (c) serial follow-up is not feasible, or (d) future management (e.g. subsequent pregnancy) would be influenced by the result. D-Dimer measurements are sensitive but nonspecific for PE and therefore may have a high negative predictive value, further simplifying the diagnostic approach to PE."

CD010864,0,21152680,0,[Risk assessment of recurrence of venous thromboembolism].,"Recurrent venous thromboembolism is associated with increased mortality in 5-9% of the patients. On the other hand prolonged anticoagulation can increase the bleeding risk which can also be responsible for an increased mortality. Therefore, it is necessary to validate the recurrence risk of venous thromboembolism on an individual basis. In this review the most relevant risk factors for recurrent venous thromboembolism are analyzed. Spontaneous thrombosis is associated with significantly increased recurrence rates in comparison to risk associated venous thrombosis. In addition, a positive D-dimer result after stop of anticoagulation, an increased amount of residual thrombus in proximal veins analyzed by compression sonography, a proximal localization of thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and male sex are clinically relevant risk factors for increased recurrence rates. While mild thrombophilic defects like heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation are not associated with a clinically relevant recurrence risk, inherited inhibitor deficiencies and the antiphospholipid-syndrome are known to be responsible for an increased recurrence rate of venous thromboembolism. A new recurrence risk-score (RR-Score) for individual judgement of patients with a first spontaneous venous thrombosis is introduced."

In 14 cases of deep vein thrombosis and in 11 cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation, compared to 19 normal subjects and 9 patients hospitalized for leg pain, free plasma gla levels were found significantly elevated (respectively 372 +/- 244 and 559 +/- 361 versus 146 +/- 34 and 120 +/- 40 pmol/mL). In six paired plasma and serum, gla levels were similar. These results suggest an involvement of blood coagulation in gla generation with need of a catabolism of the activated factors. A significant decrease was noticed during vitamin K antagonist therapy and liver disease, both instances in which the synthesis of gla containing coagulation factors is affected. During hepatocellular carcinoma with elevated desgamma carboxyprothrombin, gla was found normal, denying an global impairement of the vitamin K metabolism."
CD010864,0,21356202,0,Effects of low molecular weight fungal compounds on inflammatory gene transcription and expression in mouse alveolar macrophages.,"The inflammatory potential and molecular mechanisms underscoring inflammatory responses of lung cells to compounds from fungi that grow on damp building materials is poorly understood in vitro. In this study we evaluated the effect of pure fungal compounds on potentiating acute inflammatory response in primary mouse alveolar macrophages (AMs) and tested the hypothesis that AM responses to low molecular weight fungal compounds exhibit temporal and compound specificity that mimic that observed in the whole lung. Transcriptional responses of 13 inflammation/respiratory burst-associated genes (KC=Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl5, Cxcl10, Ccl3, Ccl112, Ccl20, IL-1Î², Il-6, ifi27 TnfÎ±, iNOS and Blvrb) were evaluated in mouse AMs exposed to a 1ml (10(-8)mol) dose of either pure atranone C, brevianimide, cladosporin, curdlan, LPS, neoechinulin A & B, sterigmatocystin or TMC-120A for 2h, 4h and 12h PE using customized reverse transcription (RT)-PCR based arrays. Multianalyte ELISA was used to measure expression of 6 pro-inflammatory cytokines common to the transcriptional assays (Cxcl1, Cxcl10, Ccl3, IL1Î², Ifn-Î» and Tnf-Î±) to determine whether gene expression corresponded to the transcription data. Compared to controls, all of these compounds induced significant (â¥2.5-fold or â¤-2.5-fold change at pâ¤0.05) time- and compound-specific transcriptional gene alterations in treatment AMs. The highest number of transcribed genes were in LPS treatment AMs at 12h PE (12/13) followed by neoechinulin B at 4h PE (11/13). Highest fold change values (>30) were associated with KC, Cxcl2, Cxcl5 and IL1Î² genes in cells exposed to LPS. Compound exposures also induced significant (pâ¤0.05) time- and compound-specific pro-inflammatory responses manifest as differentially elevated Cxcl1, Cxcl10, Ccl3, Ifn-Î» and Tnf-Î± concentrations in culture supernatant of treatment AMs. Dissimilarity in transcriptional responses in AMs and our in vivo model of lung disease is likely attributable to whole lung vs. isolated cell responsive and dose differences between the two studies. The results not only indicate that low molecular weight compounds from fungi that grow in damp built environments are potently pro-inflammatory in vitro, it further highlights the important role AMs play in innate lung defence, and against exposure to low molecular weight fungal compounds. These observations further support our position that exposure to low molecular weight compounds from indoor-associated fungi may provoke some of the inflammatory health effects reported from humans in damp building environments. They also open up a hypothesis building process that could explain the rise of non-atopic asthma associated with fungi."

We investigated occurrence frequency among non-collagen diseases and collagen-disease-complicated cases, clinical course, abnormalities of blood coagulation time, prosperity and decay of the antibodies in antibody positive cases. Many of the collagen-disease-complicated cases were chronic, progressive and had multiple thromboses and prolongation of blood coagulation time. Antiphospholipid antibodies were also detected in antibody-positive non-collagen disease cases and the rate was 8 out of 40 cases (20%). In such antibody-positive non-collagen disease cases multiple thromboses over the whole body, and abnormalities of blood coagulation time in vitro were also detected, but the occurrence rate was not so frequent compared with antibody-positive collagen disease cases. The antibody was continuously positive even a year after an acute episode of pulmonary thromboembolism in antibody positive collagen disease cases. On the other hand, the antibody had a tendency to disappear in antibody-positive non-collagen disease cases several months after such an acute episode."

Given the variable presentation and associated morbidity of this condition, an accurate and efficient diagnostic algorithm is required. Clinical pretest probability serves as the root of any diagnostic approach. We, thus, review several clinical decision rules that may help standardize this determination. Using a review of the literature, the accuracy, predictive values, and likelihood ratios for several diagnostic tests are described. The combination of these tests, based on the pretest probability of disease, can be used in a Bayesian fashion to make accurate treatment decisions.

Before and after the intravenous administration of 50 mg rt-PA over a 2 hr period, levels of total fibrinogen, fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDP), and cross-linked fibrin degradation products (XDP) were measured in each patient. Elevated levels of XDP were found in all patients before treatment (mean 2.0 micrograms/ml, normal less than 0.2 microgram/ml), and these increased 12-fold with treatment. Fibrinogen levels fell 30% and FDP levels increased 24-fold for the entire group of patients. Over this 2 hr period, 10 of 24 patients (responders) demonstrated 25% or greater improvement in the extent of pulmonary artery thrombus as quantified by Urokinase Pulmonary Embolism Trial score, and these patients were found to have a significantly lower XDP/FDP ratio after rt-PA (p less than .04) than those patients who failed to respond. These data suggest that the intravenous administration of pharmacologic doses of rt-PA in patients with pulmonary embolism produces both fibrinolysis and fibrinogenolysis, successful thrombolysis in these patients is associated with a preponderance of fibrinogenolysis over fibrinolysis, the XDP/FDP ratio is a useful indicator of fibrinolytic specificity, and in patients with acute pulmonary embolism the endogenous fibrinolytic pathways are activated, albeit ineffectively, as indicated by the increased circulating XDP levels seen in all 24 patients before the administration of rt-PA."

Current guidelines do not recommend routine prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, but the risk increases about 6.5-fold because of this treatment. D-dimer was measured at baseline in 124 cancer patients scheduled for their first chemotherapy. VTE events, including symptomatic episodes of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism or both, were recorded during the first 6 months of therapy, and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis was revealed by compression ultrasonography at baseline and after 90 and 180 days. During follow-up, there were 11 episodes of VTE (8.9%). Mean D-dimer values were higher in patients with VTE (2195 +/- 1382 vs. 695 +/- 1039 ng/ml, (P < 0.001). On grouping D-dimer values in tertiles, only 2.4% (confidence interval, 0.9-5.7%) in the first (<262 ng/ml) and second tertiles (262-650 ng/ml) suffered a deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism event as compared with 22% (confidence interval, 9-34%) in the third (>650 ng/dl) (P = 0.003). The VTE-free interval was significantly shorter in the third tertile than in the first (P = 0.0218, log-rank test; relative risk for third vs. first tertile, 11.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-81.3; P = 0.0033). Multivariate analysis found that only baseline D-dimer concentrations were correlated with the subsequent development of VTE. Baseline D-dimer values in cancer patients scheduled for chemotherapy might be used to select those at low risk of VTE, most likely to be safe without prophylaxis."
CD010864,0,16093735,0,The performance of quantitative D-dimer assays in laboratory routine.,"Assessment of D-dimer in plasma is routinely used for the exclusion of venous thrombosis and the monitoring of hypercoagulability. Little information is available about the performance of D-dimer assays in clinical laboratories examined by external quality assessment schemes. We obtained results from 423 laboratories measuring plasma pools from patients with elevated D-dimer levels mixed with human normal plasma. The results from five samples were reported containing D-dimer from the lower normal range up to a 20-fold increased level. In addition, information about the assignment of a cut-off point and the medical need to apply these assays was obtained by standardized questionnaire. Participants reported results and additional information from 20 different assays. Lack of standardization regarding the calibration concepts obstructs comparability of results. Results in one sample varied up to 20-fold between the assays applied. In addition, a high variability was reported around the cut-off values introduced for the exclusion of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. As a consequence, generally accepted cut-off values cannot be established. For cut-off assignment, 62% of participants used the kit insert but also 14% used local validation. In conclusion, standardization or at least harmonization of D-dimer assays is necessary to ensure comparability of D-dimer plasma levels measured in clinical routine."

In this study, we investigated the correlation between ET-1 and sFlt-1, placental growth factor (PlGF), sEng levels during uncomplicated normotensive pregnancy and PE. A total of 218 pregnant primigravid women were enrolled: 110 with PE and 108 uncomplicated normotensive pregnancies. PE was defined as new onset of elevated blood pressure (BP) >140/90âmmâHg and â¥2+ proteinuria on two occasions after 20 weeks of gestation in previously normotensive pregnant women. Circulating ET-1, sFlt-1, sEng and PlGF levels were estimated using enzyme immunoassays, and correlation between variables was ascertained. Women with PE showed higher levels of sFlt-1 (41.5Â±15.7 vs 6.15Â±3.4ângâml(-1), P<0.001), sEng (84.9Â±38.8 vs 13.2Â±6.3ângâml(-1), P<0.001), ET-1 (1.52Â±0.55 vs 0.88Â±0.35 pgâml(-1), P<0.001) and sFlt-1:PlGF ratio (591.1Â±468.4 vs 18.3Â±2.1, P<0.001); and lower levels of PlGF (96.3Â±47.2 vs 497.6Â±328.2 pgâml(-1), P<0.001). BP levels showed an independent relationship with sFlt-1:PlGF ratio in normotensive pregnant women and with sFlt-1:PlGF ratio and ET-1 in PE. sFlt-1 and sFlt-1:PlGF ratio correlated with proteinuria. ET-1 correlated significantly with sFlt-1, sEng and sFlt-1:PlGF ratio in PE. Our results show an association between elevation of sFlt-1 and sEng and ET-1 in the maternal circulation in PE, and strengthen the possibility that ET-1 may be a mediator in genesis of PE syndrome secondary to anti-angiogenic factors released by the placenta."

Given the common use of heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in patients with burns, we reviewed the incidence and complications of HIT in our burn center. We performed a retrospective review of all patients treated with heparin at our burn center who underwent testing for HIT from 2001 to 2005. Screening for HIT was performed by platelet factor 4 enzyme-linked immunoassay. Records were reviewed with particular attention to indications for HIT testing, duration of heparin therapy, type of heparin used (fractionated vs unfractionated), indication for heparin use (prophylactic vs therapeutic), treatment of HIT, and complications of HIT. During the 4-year study period, 625 patients received heparin therapy at some point during their hospital course. Of these patients, 43 (6.9%) underwent testing for HIT and 10 of the 43 screened patients (23%) were positive; the incidence among all heparinized burn patients was 1.6%. Thrombotic complications of HIT included arterial thrombosis requiring limb amputation (two patients), deep venous thrombosis (three patients), and pulmonary embolism (two patients). One patient died, presumably secondary to a pulmonary embolism. All patients were anticoagulated after HIT diagnosis, and four patients developed bleeding complications. HIT is a potentially devastating complication of heparin administration. Whereas our overall incidence of HIT was low, HIT+ patients developed significant complications, including arterial and venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, limb loss, and death. Treatment for such HIT-related thromboses usually resulted in bleeding complications requiring transfusions. The routine use of heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis needs to be carefully considered in light of these potential complications."

CD010864,0,18452520,0,High D-dimer levels increase the likelihood of pulmonary embolism.,"Objective. To determine the utility of high quantitative D-dimer levels in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Methods. D-dimer testing was performed in consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. We included patients with suspected pulmonary embolism with a high risk for venous thromboembolism, i.e. hospitalized patients, patients older than 80 years, with malignancy or previous surgery. Presence of pulmonary embolism was based on a diagnostic management strategy using a clinical decision rule (CDR), D-dimer testing and computed tomography. Results. A total of 1515 patients were included with an overall pulmonary embolism prevalence of 21%. The pulmonary embolism prevalence was strongly associated with the height of the D-dimer level, and increased fourfold with D-dimer levels greater than 4000 ng mL(-1) compared to levels between 500 and 1000 ng mL(-1). Patients with D-dimer levels higher than 2000 ng mL(-1) and an unlikely CDR had a pulmonary embolism prevalence of 36%. This prevalence is comparable to the pulmonary embolism likely CDR group. When D-dimer levels were above 4000 ng mL(-1), the observed pulmonary embolism prevalence was very high, independent of CDR score. Conclusion. Strongly elevated D-dimer levels substantially increase the likelihood of pulmonary embolism. Whether this should translate into more intensive diagnostic and therapeutic measures in patients with high D-dimer levels irrespective of CDR remains to be studied."
CD010864,0,18560273,0,Induction of macroautophagy by exogenously introduced calcium.,"Macroautophagy can be activated by a broad range of agents and cellular manipulations. In performing cellular transfection using the calcium phosphate method, we noticed that the calcium phosphate precipitates (CPP) could induce LC3 punctation. Because of the wide use of this transfection method in mammalian cells and the potential significance of calcium in autophagy induction, we investigated whether CPP could specifically induce macroautophagy. We found that CPP-induced LC3 punctation was dependent on calcium and could be neutralized by an extracelluar or intracellular calcium chelator. The punctation was not due to nonspecific aggregation of LC3 since it depended on the amino acid residue Glycine120, which is specifically required for LC3 to conjugate to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Consistently, there was also a significant increase of the PE-conjugated form of LC3. Electron microscopy confirmed the accumulation of typical autophagosomes following CPP treatment. Flux analysis indicated that CPP induced but did not inhibit autophagic degradation. Finally CPP-induced autophagy depended on the classical macroautophagy machinery including Beclin 1, the class III phosphoinositide-3 kinase and Atg5. Our studies thus indicate that exogenously introduced calcium in the form of CPP could specifically induce macroautophagy, which may have the practical significance in the use of this agent for introducing genes into cells, and for studying the mechanism of autophagy as a model system."
CD010864,0,11713014,0,[Value of D-dimer measurement in the exclusion diagnosis of pulmonary embolism].,"Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, a common and potentially fatal disease, is first based on clinical probability assessment, and often requires invasive testing such as pulmonary angiography. However, it often represents a diagnosis challenge. The measurement of D-dimer, a specific fibrin degradation product, was recently introduced in the diagnosis strategy. Even if D-dimer levels are highly sensitive in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, they are not specific of an on-going venous thromboembolic process. Its high negative predictive value enables to validly exclude diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, particularly in outpatients, in the case of D-dimer levels below a well-defined cut-off value. Prospective management studies confirmed that D-dimer measurement could be validly used as an initial screening test in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism. Using such a diagnosis strategy, imaging tests would be performed only in the case of high D-dimer levels i.e. above the cut-off level. Even if they constitute the gold standard, conventional Elisa are not useful as a routine emergency test. New rapid and automated assays based on various principles (Elisa-derived or micro-latex agglutination) are now available. All demonstrated both high sensitivity (about 100%) and negative predictive value (over 98%), using a well-defined cut-off level (usually defined to be 500 ng/mL). Finally, with the increasing number of new D-dimer assays currently available, a lack of standardization was pointed out. As the result, both the clinical significance and the cut-off level have to be defined in prospective clinical trials, for each individual assay."

It helps establish which test or sequence of tests can effectively corroborate or safely rule out PE. For example, it has been demonstrated that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in patients with negative d-dimer results and low pretest probability at initial presentation. Clinical probability will also increase the diagnostic yield of ventilation perfusion lung scan. Compared with clinical gestalt, clinical prediction rules provide a standardized and more reproducible estimate of a patient's probability of having a PE. Clinical prediction models combine aspects of the history and physical examination to categorize a patient's probability of having a disease. The models classify patients as having a low, moderate, or high likelihood of having PE. Clinical prediction models have been validated and are well established for the diagnosis of PE in symptomatic patients. They allow all physicians, whatever their expertise, to reliably determine the clinical pretest probability of PE, and thus safely manage their patients using diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms."

D-dimer measurement is promising as a test to exclude PE in young healthy out-patients, and further study and improvements in technology, can clarify the usefulness of the different methods of performing this assay.

The process of antigen incorporation into microspheres can expose fragile antigens to damaging conditions, such as high temperatures, and to bacterial contamination. Maintenance of immunogenicity of several antigens and reduction of bacterial load in alginate microspheres following boiling was evaluated. Mice were immunized subcutaneously, initially and again 21 days later, with either non-boiled or boiled microspheres containing ovalbumin (OVA), a culture supernatant vaccine of Pasteurella haemolytica (PHV), or a potassium thiocyanate extract of P. multocida (PTE). Serum samples were obtained prior to immunization and at the time of euthanasia 28 days later. Culture of microspheres showed that boiling completely eliminated aerobic bacterial growth for OVA-containing microspheres, and reduced growth by a factor of 10(4) for PTE microspheres. More bacteria were cultured after boiling than before for PHV microspheres. ELISA performed on serum and intestinal lamina propria explant supernatants showed that immunogenicity of PHV microspheres was not altered by boiling. Boiled OVA microspheres were still able to stimulate a significant serum IgG anti-OVA titer in mice, but boiled PTE microspheres completely lacked immunogenicity. Elispot assays of spleens showed that only PHV microspheres were able to retain immunogenicity after boiling. Results indicate that boiling is not an effective means for reducing the bacterial load of alginate microspheres and that the process is associated with a diminution of vaccine immunogenicity."

We determined peripheral blood concentrations of adiponectin and leptin in 40 healthy nonpregnant women with a body mass index (BMI)<25, 40 healthy pregnant women with prepregnancy BMI<25, and 15 PE patients with prepregnancy BMI<25. Serum adiponectin concentrations were lower in the healthy pregnant group than in the nonpregnant group (9.40+/-4.43 versus 13.15+/-6.69 microg/mL, p<0.01), but difference disappeared after correction for haematocrit.

CD010864,0,10912642,0,Recurrent venous thromboembolism: diagnosis and management.,"A diagnosis of recurrent venous thromboembolism is commonly suspected by physicians in the clinical setting. Many do not realize that recurrent venous thromboembolism may mimic the first venous thromboembolic event (VTE) and that only 20 to 30% of patients who have had a first VTE actually have objective recurrent thrombotic disease. Objective testing is necessary to prevent the misdiagnosis of thrombophilia in patients and the associated exposure to prolonged anticoagulant treatment that accompanies that diagnosis. In patients with clinically suspected recurrent venous thrombosis, compression ultrasonography in a new venous segment is the preferred diagnostic approach and contrast venography is an alternative test. There is insufficient evidence to know whether D-dimer testing is an effective approach to the diagnosis of thrombophilia. In patients with suspected recurrent pulmonary embolism, the diagnostic method should begin with ventilation/perfusion lung-imaging and a complementary pulmonary angiography when the results of initial tests are equivocal. Patients with recurrent venous thromboembolism should be treated with anticoagulants for longer than 6 months but the precise period depends on the patient's risk of bleeding as a result of the treatment. Finally, there is currently a lack of evidence that risk for recurrent VTE is increased in patients with a first episode of venous thromboembolism and heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation or the G2021OA prothrombin mutation."

All patients were assessed using the Wells clinical score, capnography, computed tomographic pulmonary angiography, D-dimer measurement, lower-extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography, and V/Q scintigraphy. Forty patients (69%) had PE based on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography findings. The AVDSf value with the highest sensitivity and specificity, which was at the same time statistically significant, was 0.09. This value was consistent with the AVDSf value obtained using receiver operating characteristic analysis.

CD010864,0,21464639,0,"Evaluation of acute chest pain in the emergency department: ""triple rule-out"" computed tomography angiography.","Triage of patients with acute, potentially life-threatening chest pain is one of the most important issues currently facing physicians in the emergency department. Appropriate evaluation of these patients begins with a skilled assessment of the individual patient's presenting symptoms and a careful review of his or her history and physical examination, often followed by serial recording of electrocardiograms and measurement of serum biochemical markers such as troponin and d-dimer. Stress testing, often accompanied by rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging or echocardiography, and other diagnostic testing such as radionuclide lung scanning and invasive angiography may be required. A rapid, accurate, and cost-effective approach for the evaluation of emergency department patients with chest pain is needed. Development of newer generations of multidetector computed tomographic (MDCT) scanners, which are capable not only of performing high-quality noninvasive coronary angiography, but also concurrent aortic and pulmonary angiography, has led to increased use of MDCT for the so-called ""triple rule out."" MDCT is used for the detection of 3 of the most common life-threatening causes of chest pain-coronary artery disease, acute aortic syndrome, and pulmonary emboli. While triple rule-out protocol can be very useful and potentially cost effective when used appropriately, concern has risen regarding the overuse of this technology, which could expose patients to unnecessary radiation and iodinated contrast. The triple rule-out protocol is most appropriate for patients who present with acute chest pain, but are judged to have low to intermediate increased risk for acute coronary syndrome, and whose chest pain symptoms might also be attributed to acute pathologic conditions of the aorta or pulmonary arteries. MDCT should not be used as a routine screening procedure. Continued technical improvements in acquisition speed and spatial resolution of computed tomography images, and development of more efficient image reconstruction algorithms which reduce patient exposure to radiation and contrast, may result in increased popularity of MDCT for ""triple rule-out."""

Up to now immunohistological studies on human gingival LC have been carried out using antibodies against HLA-DR or CD1a molecules. A new marker of LC called Langerin (CD207) and described, among other subcellular localisations, in the Birbeck granules is now available in immunohistochemistry. The purpose of this in situ study was to quantify and to compare Langerin+ versus CD1a+ LC number in order to show differences in the expression of these molecules, if any, and to determine which marker is the most specific. The present study was conducted using nine frozen healthy gingival samples. Double immunofluorescence procedures were performed with an anti-Langerin antibody revealed by FITC and with an anti-CD1a-PE antibody. Mounted slides were analysed by fluorescence microscopy and quantifications were performed on projected slides associated with a grid of 0.015 mm(2). Our results have shown that 1/ the number of CD1a+ LC was significantly increased (P=0.01) when compared with Langerin+ LC 2/ 92% of Langerin+ LC co-expressed CD1a 3/ only 82% of CD1a+ cells co-expressed Langerin 4/ a positive correlation was noted between CD1a+ and Langerin+ LC numbers.

To understand the function of IL-1-family members in human glioblastomas, we have studied 6 glioblastoma cell lines. RT-PCR, ISH, ELISA and 125I-IL-1-binding assays revealed expression of IL-1 and high-affinity receptors for human (h)IL-1 in all but 1 cell line. Using a colony growth assay in semi-solid media for testing serial plating efficacy (PE, number of colonies per number of cells seeded in %), only the IL-1R-negative cell line was not influenced by recombinant human (rh)IL-1alpha or -beta, whereas IL-1 down-regulated the self-renewal of clonogenic cells of the other glioblastomas. Tritiated thymidine uptake was down-regulated by rhIL-1 in all cell lines studied. Cell viability remained unchanged by rhIL-1. Wherever growth modulation by rhIL-1 was detected, it could be reversed by either soluble IL-1R I or II or by rhIL-1 receptor antagonist (ra). IL-1ra not only was able to reverse rhIL-1-induced growth modulation but alone could modulate glioblastoma growth in comparison with control in cell lines producing IL-1. Our results show the presence of public autocrine loops for IL-1 leading to growth inhibition in some glioblastomas. To understand these loops, we have studied expression and function of IL-1ra in glioblastomas. ISH of human glioblastoma tissue sections revealed expression of hIL-1ra in all 8 cases evaluable. In 4 of 6 cell lines, IL-1ra was found in the supernatant under constitutive conditions, the IL-1R-negative line being among the 2 non-producers. The other non-producing cell line, HTB 17, showed expression of hIL-1R II. Most interestingly, a neutralizing antibody against IL-1ra down-regulated growth of IL-1- and IL-1ra-producing glioblastoma cells to approx. 30% of the controls. Thus, public autocrine loops for IL-1 in human glioblastomas exist and result in growth inhibition. An autocrine production of IL-1-antagonizing molecules such as IL-1ra by these tumors can counteract this IL-1 function and represent a basic escape mechanism supporting malignant growth in some glioblastomas."

Pulmonary perfusion scans and changes in indexes of coagulation and of fibrinolysis, and in the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood were evaluated as possible signs of pulmonary embolism complicating TAE. In 3 out of 13 patients (23%), perfusion lung scans showed perfusion defects. These 3 patients were asymptomatic and their perfusion defects had disappeared by 4 weeks later. TAE was followed by significant decreases in platelet counts (p < 0.01) and in serotonin levels (p < 0.05); and by increases in A-aDO2 (p < 0.01), in levels of fibrinogen in plasma (p < 0.01), and in levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) (p < 0.05), with no significant increase in levels of D-dimer in plasma. Similar hematologic changes were observed in patients without perfusion defects after TAE. In 3 patients with perfusion defects, plasma levels of TAT before TAE were significantly higher than the levels in patients without perfusion defects (p < 0.01). Perfusion defects that occur after TAE may be caused by pulmonary thromboemboli, by pulmonary fat emboli, and by microatelectasis or discoid atelectasis, and the most common cause is probably pulmonary thromboemboli. We conclude that the risk of pulmonary embolism complicating TAE is higher in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have high levels of TAT in plasma."

An update on evidence-based medicine of treatment for DVT.,"Venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represent a major source of morbidity and mortality today. Incidence of DVT is estimated to be 56 to 160/100,000 population per year. Systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin with initiation of oral vitamin K antagonist therapy has been shown to be beneficial in preventing pulmonary embolism and reducing extension and recurrence of DVT. The duration of anticoagulation following an episode of DVT is determined by the greatest predictors of recurrence. These include the presence of reversible risk factors, nonreversible risk factors, and no risk factors (idiopathic or unprovoked DVT). Short durations of anticoagulation are only appropriate for calf DVTs in patients with reversible risk factors. Patients with nonreversible risk factors, such as malignancy and certain inherited thrombophilias with a strong family history of venous thromboembolism will require lifelong anticoagulation. Those with proximal DVT due to reversible risk factors require 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation. Patients with idiopathic DVT require reassessment of risk-to-benefit ratio of hemorrhage from oral vitamin K antagonist therapy compared to reducing risk of recurrence and frequently require prolonged oral anticoagulant therapy. Monitoring with d-dimer and serial ultrasounds may offer an individualized approach to therapy."

CD010864,0,9857934,0,Troponin T or troponin I or CK-MB (or none?).,"Differential diagnosis of patients who present with chest pain remains problematical. It has been shown that 11.8-7% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are sent home from the emergency department (ED). Audit of our own ED has shown the incidence of missed prognostically significant myocardial damage to be 6.7%. Diagnostic criteria for AMI have classically been based on the triad of history, ECG and measurement of cardiac enzymes. The choice of 'cardiac enzymes' has been dictated by the evolution of laboratory techniques, commencing with measurement of aspartate transaminase and progressing to measurement of creatine kinase (CK) and its MB isoenzyme (CK-MB). Measurement of CK-MB has been shown by both clinical studies and rigorous statistical analysis to represent the best test for the diagnosis of AMI. The advent of real time immunoassay together with advances in therapeutic options for management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has resulted in a paradigm shift in the approach to laboratory testing. Immunoassay for CK-MB (CK-MB mass measurement) is diagnostically superior to CK-MB activity measurement and is the test of choice for 'classical' AMI. Development of immunoassays for the cardiac troponins, i.e. cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), has enhanced diagnostic specificity. These measurements are completely specific for cardiac damage, allow quantitation of the extent of infarction and are diagnostically superior to CK-MB measurement. Applications of this specificity have included the differential diagnosis of CK elevation in arduous physical training, detection of myocardial damage after DC cardioversion and prediction of ejection fraction. Of more interest is the utility of these markers in management of patients presenting without clear electrocardiographic changes. Diagnosis and management of patients presenting with ST segment elevation has been clarified by large clinical trials of thrombolytic agents. In such patients, thrombolysis is the treatment of choice. Patients presenting with ST segment elevation represents the minority of patients with probable ACS 9.6% of all patients presenting to our hospital. The majority require risk stratification into high- and low-risk groups. It is here that cardiac troponins have a major role. The measurement of cTnT has been shown in a large number of studies to enable risk stratification of patients with unstable angina. The combination of cTnT, admission ECG and stress ECG can be used for a comprehensive risk stratification of patients with unstable angina. The combination of cTnT, admission ECG and stress ECG can be used for a comprehensive risk stratification which can be completed by 24 h from admission, as well as allowing a safe discharge policy from the ED. Measurements of cardiac troponins can also be used to predict prognosis in patients with other diagnostic categories. Patients with cardiac failure can be risk stratified according to cTnT status. cTnT status on admission allows subdivision into high- and low-risk groups in patients presenting with ST segment elevation. Certainly, cTnT measurement can be incorporated into a clinical decision-making strategy to assign patients to investigation and management pathways. There is evidence that cTnT may be useful to guide therapeutic options. The major issue is one of cost. In the U.K. model of managed care with undemanding diagnostic standards, the role of cTnT will be to enhance clinical decision-making strategies, to provide accurate diagnosis and to reduce lengths of stay. This can be shown to have potential for major improvements in cost efficiency. Improvements in diagnostic accuracy can reduce inappropriate long-term drug therapy. In systems with a more aggressive laboratory investigation strategy, rationalization of test numbers will provide an immediate cost reduction while improving quality. Finally, use of point-of-care testing (POCT) means that biochemical testing can be pe"

We hypothesized that carboxymethyl lipids such as (carboxymethyl)phosphatidylethanolamine (carboxymethyl-PE) would also be formed in these reactions, and we therefore developed a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay for quantification of carboxymethylethanolamine (CME) following hydrolysis of phospholipids. In vitro, CME was formed during glycation of dioleoyl-PE under air and from linoleoylpalmitoyl-PE, but not from dioleoyl-PE, in the absence of glucose. In vivo, CME was detected in lipid extracts of red blood cell membranes, approximately 0.14 mmol of CME/mol of ethanolamine, from control and diabetic subjects, (n = 22, p >> 0.5). Levels of CML in erythrocyte membrane proteins were approximately 0.2 mmol/mol of lysine for both control and diabetic subjects (p >> 0.5). For this group of diabetic subjects there was no indication of increased oxidative modification of either lipid or protein components of red cell membranes. CME was also detected in fasting urine at 2-3 nmol/mg of creatinine in control and diabetic subjects (p = 0.085). CME inhibited detection of advanced glycation end product (AGE)-modified protein in a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an anti-AGE antibody previously shown to recognize CML, suggesting that carboxymethyl-PE may be a component of AGE lipids detected in AGE low density lipoprotein. Measurement of levels of CME in blood, tissues, and urine should be useful for assessing oxidative damage to membrane lipids during aging and in disease."

CD010864,0,23183267,0,Role of glutaminyl cyclases in thyroid carcinomas.,"CCL2 is a chemokine known to recruit monocytes/macrophages to sites of inflammation. CCL2 is also associated with tumor progression in several cancer types. Recently, we showed that the N-terminus of CCL2 is modified to a pyroglutamate (pE)-residue by both glutaminyl cyclases (QC (QPCT)) and its isoenzyme (isoQC (QPCTL)). The pE-residue increases stability against N-terminal degradation by aminopeptidases. Here, we report an upregulation of QPCT expression in tissues of patients with thyroid carcinomas compared with goiter tissues, whereas QPCTL was not regulated. In thyroid carcinoma cell lines, QPCT gene expression correlates with the mRNA levels of its substrate CCL2. Both QPCT and CCL2 are regulated in a NF-ÎºB-dependent pathway shown by stimulation with TNFa and IL1b as well as by inhibition with the IKK2 inhibitor and RNAi of p50. In the culture supernatant of thyroid carcinoma cells, equal amounts of pECCL2 and total CCL2 were detected by two ELISAs discriminating between total CCL2 and pECCL2, concluding that all CCL2 is secreted as pECCL2. Activation of the CCL2/CCR2 pathway by recombinant CCL2 increased tumor cell migration of FTC238 cells in scratch assays as well as thyroid carcinoma cell-derived CCL2-induced migration of monocytic THP1 cells. Suppression of CCL2 signaling by CCR2 antagonist, IKK2 inhibitor, and QPCT RNAi reduced FTC238 cell growth measured by WST8 proliferation assays. Our results reveal new evidence for a novel role of QC in thyroid carcinomas and provide an intriguing rationale for the use of QC inhibitors as a means of blocking pECCL2 formation and preventing thyroid cancer metastasis."
CD010864,0,8710257,0,Clinical diagnosis and management of the patient with deep venous thromboembolism and acute pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism is the third most common acute cause of death in the United States. There are approximately 500,000 cases annually in this country, leading to death in 50,000. Subjective symptoms and objective findings can oftentimes be confusing and nonspecific. A pulmonary embolism is defined as an occlusion of one or more pulmonary vessels by material that has traveled there from outside of the lung and is usually caused by a dislodged thrombus that originated in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis. Risk factors include older age, prior thromboembolism, immobility, cancer, chronic disease, congestive heart failure, pelvic and lower extremity surgery, varicosities, obesity, and oral contraception.

The pulmonary lymph was used to assess changes in pulmonary lymph flow (Qlym) (a measure of net transvascular fluid filtration rate) and the lymph/plasma protein concentration ratio (L/P) (a measure of protein seiving across the microvascular barrier). Studies were made in 3 groups: Control-Thrombin (n = 7) received 96.9 +/- 9.4 U/kg of alpha-thrombin, Control-FDP (n = 6) received infusion of FDP prepared by plasmin digestion of fibrin, and Thrombin-FDP (n = 5) received thrombin (102.0 +/- 7.5 U/kg) and then an FDP infusion was begun at 60 min after the thrombin. In the Control-Thrombin animals, Qlym increased without a change in the L/P after thrombin, indicating an increase in vascular permeability to proteins. In the Control-FDP group, infusion of FDP had no effect on Qlym and L/P. In the Thrombin-FDP group, thrombin increased Qlym with no change in the L/P and the subsequent infusion of FDP further increased Qlym but slightly decreased the L/P, an effect not seen in the Control-FDR group. The results indicate that FDP infusion alone does not alter pulmonary transvascular fluid and protein exchange. However, in the presence of thrombin-induced pulmonary microembolization FDP infusion enhances the net transvascular fluid filtration rate, probably by increasing the capillary hydrostatic pressure."

CD010864,0,22871551,0,Silibinin modulates the NF-Îºb pathway and pro-inflammatory cytokine production by mononuclear cells from preeclamptic women.,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a complication of human pregnancy associated with an intense inflammatory response involving leukocyte activation, as well as elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) is present in cells of the immune system and is responsible for transcription of genes coding for pro-inflammatory proteins. Silibinin is the main component of silymarin, a polyphenolic extract obtained from fruits and seeds of Silybum marianum with potent hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we assessed whether silibinin modulated NF-ÎºB activity and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from preeclamptic patients. PBMC from women with PE, normotensive (NT) pregnant women, and nonpregnant (NP) women were cultured with or without silibinin (5 Î¼M and 50 Î¼M) and 1 Î¼g/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 h. The supernatants were assayed for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²) by ELISA. Cells were cultured for 30 min to evaluate NF-ÎºB activity. There was increased endogenous activation of NF-ÎºB as well as TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² release by PBMC in the PE group compared with the NT and NP groups. A positive correlation between NF-ÎºB activity and cytokine production was also observed in the PE group. Silibinin was capable of reducing, at least in part, the levels of NF-ÎºB and cytokines TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² in preeclamptic women.

CD010864,0,1631787,1,D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin III complexes in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism.,"One hundred and fifty-six consecutive patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) had blood drawn to measure levels of D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes and underwent ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning and bilateral impedance plethysmography (IPG); pulmonary angiography was performed in 10 patients. Patients were classified as: PE-positive (positive pulmonary angiography or high probability lung scan or non-high probability lung scan and abnormal IPG) or, PE-negative (normal lung scan or normal pulmonary angiography) or PE-unlikely (non-high probability lung scan and normal serial IPG and absence of venous thromboembolism in follow-up). Thirty patients were classified as PE-positive, 64 as PE-negative and 62 patients as PE-unlikely. PE-positive patients were treated with anticoagulants, whereas PE-negative and PE-unlikely patients were not. PE-unlikely patients were followed for 3 months with repeat IPG and clinical evaluation for the occurrence of venous thromboembolism. The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values and negative predictive values of the D-dimer and TAT complex assays were calculated for patients classified as PE-positive and PE-negative. In addition, the prevalences of normal D-dimer and TAT complex assays were calculated for PE-unlikely patients. Cutoffs of 300 ng/ml for D-dimer and 3.5 micrograms/ml for TAT complexes provided sensitivities of 96% for both assays, negative predictive values of 97% for D-dimer and 96% for TAT complexes and specificities of 52% for D-dimer and 51% for TAT complexes. The specificities of the assays were higher in patients without comorbid conditions and in outpatients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Sensitivity and specificity were determined in 833 consecutive patients investigated for a monoclonal gammopathy. Serum protein electrophoresis (PE), serum kappa/lambda free light chain (FLC) ratio, and serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) were performed in all patients. Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with a malignant plasma cell disorder, 25 with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 156 with MGUS. Serum PE (with follow-up IFE) plus FLC had a sensitivity of 82.3% and a specificity of 96.8% and missed one plasmacytoma and 23 patients with MGUS. Serum IFE plus urine IFE had a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 100% and missed two MGUS patients. Serum IFE plus FLC had a sensitivity of 93.8% and a specificity of 96.8% and missed one MGUS patient. Serum PE plus FLC had a significantly lower sensitivity than serum IFE plus FLC or serum IFE plus urine IFE for the diagnosis of MGUS. The sensitivity of serum IFE plus FLC was comparable to the sensitivity of serum IFE plus urine IFE. The specificity of serum IFE plus FLC, however, was lower than the specificity of serum IFE plus urine IFE."

CD010864,0,20926499,0,Diagnosis of venous thromboembolism: an update.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis owing to the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Phlebography and pulmonary angiography are invasive and resource-demanding imaging modalities. Because the prevalence of DVT and PE is relatively low (typically 20% or less) among clinically suspected individuals, submitting all of them to imaging would not be cost-effective. Therefore, non-invasive diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement. These initial steps allow the selection of patients who require non-invasive imaging: compression ultrasonography in cases of suspected DVT and multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography in cases of suspected PE. This review gives a critical appraisal of the sequential steps of the diagnostic work-up in suspected DVT or PE."
CD010864,0,10936861,0,Plasma levels of activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex in patients with hypercoagulable states.,"Plasma levels of activated protein C (APC)-protein C inhibitor (PCI) were significantly increased in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pulmonary embolism (PE), or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Plasma levels of APC-alpha(1)-antitrypsin (AT) complex were significantly increased in patients with DIC and in those with TTP. Plasma levels of PCI were significantly decreased in patients with DIC, non-DIC, or TTP and in those undergoing HD. In the pre-DIC stage, the plasma levels of APC-PCI complex were significantly increased but not those of APC-alpha(1)-AT complex. These data suggest that measurements of APC-PCI complex and APC-alpha(1)-AT complex may be useful for the diagnosis of DIC. After treatment of DIC, the plasma levels of APC-PCI complex and APC-alpha(1)-AT complex were significantly decreased, but not those of PCI. Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasmin-alpha(2)-plasmin complex (PPIC), D-dimer, and soluble fibrin monomer (SFM) were markedly increased in patients with DIC or pre-DIC and were moderately increased in patients with non-DIC, TTP, AMI, PE, or DVT and in those undergoing HD. The receiving operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that SFM and the APC-PCT complex are useful markers for diagnosis of DIC. The specificity of plasma TAT and PPIC levels was low. The positive rate of APC-PCI complex was higher than 90% with DIC, TTP, AMI, PE, and it was higher than 60% with DVT and HD. Since the APC-PCI complex was elevated not only in patients with venous thrombosis but also in those with arterial thrombosis, components of the protein C pathway might be useful markers for the diagnosis of arterial thrombosis."

State of the art and diagnostic algorithms.,"From the early 90s, spiral CT technology has considerably changed the diagnostic capability of Pulmonary Embolism (PE), giving a direct vision of intravascular thrombi. Further technological progress has strengthened its diagnostic impact leading to an essential role in clinical practice. The advent of Multi-Detector CT (MDCT) has subsequently increased the reliability of this technique to the point of undermining the role of pulmonary angiography as the gold standard and occupying a central position in diagnostic algorithms. The aim of this paper is to appraise this evolution by means of a meta-analysis of the relevant literature from 1995 to 2004."

The modified PCP model for PE of Wells et al. allows reasonably accurate classification of patients with no, low, moderate, and high probability for PE. The combined rational use of the evidence-based noninvasive imaging techniques P-scan, CUS, and spiral CT with the rapid ELISA D-dimer test and PCP will reduce the need for invasive pulmonary angiography to perhaps 10 to 15% of patients, who initially presented with suspected PE. A Rational Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism (RADIA PE) model is proposed for testing in a large multicenter study of patients with suspected PE."

The aim of this study was to examine the combined effect of the ACE-I and IFN on the murine hepatic fibrosis development. A model of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis was used to assess the effect of the clinically used ACE-I, perindopril (PE), and IFN-beta. The PE and IFN were administered after 2-week treatment with CCl(4), and the hepatic indices of fibrosis were assessed at 8 weeks. Single treatment with either PE or IFN at the clinically available comparable doses significantly attenuated liver fibrogenesis associated with suppression of the hepatic hydroxyproline and serum fibrosis markers. The number of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells, and the hepatic alpha1(I)-procollagen mRNA were also markedly inhibited. The inhibitory effect of PE was more potent than IFN, and the combination treatment with PE and IFN almost completely attenuated liver fibrosis development. In vitro, the angiotensin-II (AT-II) type 1 receptor blocker and IFN suppressed the AT-II-induced proliferation and alpha1(I)-procollagen mRNA expression of the activated hepatic stellate cells. The combination treatment of the clinically used PE and IFN may provide a new strategy for anti-liver fibrosis therapy."
CD010864,0,2566588,0,Characterization of southern African isolates of maize streak virus: typing of three isolates by restriction mapping.,"The genomic replicative form DNAs (RF-DNA) of three maize streak virus isolates (MSV-CT, MSV-PE, and MSV-SW) from widely separated locations in southern Africa were characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping in order to assess the feasibility of using the technique to determine genetic variability between isolates. The viruses were transmitted to and propagated in laboratory-grown maize by the leafhopper vector Cicadulina mbila (NaudÃ©). MSV-PE produced more severe symptoms than MSV-CT and MSV-SW; the isolates were serologically identical in 'western' immunoblot tests, but distinct in 'sandwich' enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RF-DNA of all three isolates was prepared from infected maize; the RF-DNA of MSV-CT and MSV-PE was cloned in a plasmid vector in Escherichia coli. Restriction maps were generated from this cloned DNA and from the RF-DNA of MSV-SWA. The maps were similar in regions expected to be conserved, but there were also important differences between all isolates. The implications of these results, and of relationships amongst these and other sequenced isolates of MSV, are discussed."

CD010864,0,17024594,0,The value of clinical findings and D-dimer tests in diagnosing deep vein thrombosis in primary care.,"In primary care, the physician has to decide which patients with a suspicion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) have to be referred for further diagnostic work-up. Accurate referral is of utmost importance because unrecognized and therefore untreated DVT may cause pulmonary embolism. The classic clinical findings are not sufficiently accurate for the diagnosis of DVT. The majority of the referred patients, 70 to 80%, do not have DVT and this puts a burden on both patients and health care budgets. Diagnosis in primary care is different from that in secondary care caused by the referral mechanism or spectrum difference. Diagnostic tests derived in secondary care, therefore, cannot simply be generalized to primary-care patients. The well-known diagnostic rule for DVT, the Wells rule, does not adequately rule out DVT in primary-care patients. A proper diagnostic rule for use in primary care is lacking; therefore, we investigated the data of 1,295 patients in primary care suspected of having DVT. We developed and validated a simple diagnostic decision rule to exclude the presence of DVT safely in primary care. Independent diagnostic indicators of the presence of DVT were male gender, oral contraceptive use, presence of malignancy, recent surgery, absence of leg trauma, vein distension, calf circumference difference, and D-dimer test result. Application of this rule could reduce the number of referrals by at least 23%, whereas only 0.7% of the patients with a DVT would not be referred. A diagnosis strategy is given, together with a practical flow diagram."

Compression ultrasonography (CUS) and spiral computed tomography (CT) currently are the methods of choice to confirm or rule out deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), respectively. CUS has a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97 to 98%, indicating the need to improve the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected DVT by clinical score assessment and D-dimer testing. Spiral CT as a stand-alone method detects all clinically relevant PEs and a large number of alternative diagnoses. It rules out PE with a NPV of 98 to 99%. Spiral CT is expensive, emphasizing the need to improve the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected PE by the use of clinical score assessment and D-dimer testing. Clinical score assessment for DVT and PE has not safely ruled out VTE in multicenter studies and in routine daily practices. Modification of the Wells clinical score assessment for DVT by elimination of the ""minus 2 points"" for alternative diagnosis will improve the reproducibility of the clinical score assessment. The combination of a first negative CUS and a negative SimpliRed or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) VIDAS D-dimer of < 1,000 ng/mL safely exclude DVT (NPV > 99%) irrespective of clinical score assessment and without the need to repeat CUS in approximately 60 to 70% of patients. The rapid quantitative and qualitative agglutination D-dimer assays for the exclusion of VTE are not sensitive enough as stand-alone tests and should be used in combination with clinical score assessment. A normal rapid ELISA VIDAS D-dimer test as a stand-alone test safely excludes DVT and PE, with a NPV of 99 to 100%, irrespective of clinical score, without the need of CUS or spiral CT. The combined strategy of a rapid ELISA VIDAS D-dimer followed by objective testing with CUS for DVT and by spiral CT for PE will reduce the need for noninvasive imaging techniques by 40 to 50%."
CD010864,0,9513333,0,[Postoperative hypoxia and hyperfibrinolysis in patients after total knee replacement].,"It was revealed that postoperative hypoxia had occurred frequently in patients after total knee replacement (TKR) in our preliminary study. Since we speculated that pulmonary embolism was the cause of the hypoxia, we investigated the relationship between PaO2 and D-dimer in patients after TKR and high tibial osteotomy (HTO). A total of 13 patients with the diagnosis of osteoarthritis were studied. Ten patients underwent TKR and three received HTO under subarachnoid block. Arterial oxygen tension and D-dimer were unchanged in patients who had undergone HTO. Even on the 5th postoperative day, five of the ten patients after TKR revealed a decrease in oxygen tension by more than 10% compared with the preoperative control (hypoxia group). In the other patients after TKR, a decrease of oxygen tension on the 5th postoperative day was under 10% (non-hypoxia group). There was a positive correlation between a decrease of PaO2 and a value of D-dimer in all of the patients who had undergone TKR and HTO. Although no patient developed dyspnea clinically, one patient in hypoxia group was diagnosed as pulmonary embolism in the scintigram. It is likely that pulmonary embolism is the cause of postoperative hypoxia in patients after TKR."

CD010864,0,10805292,0,Increased hemostatic molecular markers in patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy.,"We evaluated several molecular markers of hemostasis in 92 patients with hypercoagulable states treated with anticoagulant therapy. In all patients, the average values of the international normalized ratio (INR) were 1.70 +/- 0.50; this increase in INR was not, however, significant in patients under thrombotest (TT) monitoring. There were no thrombotic or severe bleeding complications in these patients during a period of 27 months. Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex (PPIC), D-dimer, and soluble fibrin monomer (sFM) were slightly increased, suggesting that anticoagulant therapy was not completely effective in our Japanese patients based on the values of the TT. The INR was negatively correlated with TT, protein C, and protein S and particularly with TT between 10 and 80%. The range of TT was not correlated with the plasma level of TAT, PPIC, D-dimer, or sFM, but the range of INR was correlated with the plasma level of TAT, D-dimer, and sFM. The percentage of TAT, D-dimer, and sFM within normal range was significantly lower in patients with high INR. These findings show that INR is better than TT for the monitoring of warfarin therapy and that the therapeutic values of INR during the anticoagulant therapy should be > 1.7 in Japanese patients."
CD010864,0,12165290,0,Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor antigen and TAFI activity in patients with APC resistance caused by factor V Leiden mutation.,"Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), also known as procarboxypeptidase U or plasma procarboxypeptidase B, is a relatively recently described plasma glycoprotein synthesised in the liver. It can be activated into active enzyme TAFIa (carboxypeptidase U or plasma carboxypeptidase B) by a complex of thrombin/thrombomodulin. TAFIa can potentially inhibit fibrinolysis by removing carboxyterminal lysine residues from partially degraded fibrin, decreasing plasminogen binding on the surface of fibrin, which thereby results in a decrease of the fibrinolytic activity. Since TAFI represents a connection between coagulation and fibrinolysis, it can be expected that TAFI levels are altered in different thrombotic and hemorrhagic diseases. Thrombin generation is increased in patients with activated protein C (APC) resistance, while it has been shown that APC has profibrinolytic effect. Therefore, changes in TAFI level should be found in patients with APC resistance due to factor V Leiden (FV Leiden) mutation. TAFI antigen (including TAFI, TAFIa and the inactive form TAFIai) and TAFI activity were determined in 17 female patients heterozygous for FV Leiden mutation while 13 healthy volunteers were controls. No statistically significant difference in levels of TAFI antigen was observed. TAFI activity was significantly reduced in APC resistance patients compared to control (P=.018). The nondifference in TAFI antigen, together with the decrease of TAFI activity level, can be explained by activation of TAFI to TAFIa and shifting of equilibrium towards an increase of the latter. This can be an indirect proof that TAFIa is increased in patients with APC resistance due to FV Leiden mutation, indicating that downregulation of fibrinolysis can be an additional risk factor for thrombosis in these patients."

CD010864,0,7963702,0,The influence of adjuvant on the therapeutic efficacy of a recombinant genital herpes vaccine.,"The potential use of vaccines for treatment of chronic or persistent virus infections is an area of great interest and controversy. Previous experiments have shown that the incidence and severity of spontaneous recurrent genital herpes in latently infected guinea pigs could be significantly reduced by vaccination with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein subunit vaccines. The current study shows the critical role of adjuvant in an effective formulation. Immunization of previously infected guinea pigs with a subunit vaccine containing a muramyl peptide derivative, MTP-PE, in a low-oil emulsion as adjuvant reduced the incidence of recurrent disease up to 80% compared with formulations lacking MPT-PE. Vaccines containing adjuvant alone failed to modify recurrences. Alum, the traditional adjuvant, was not effective. Glycoprotein subunit vaccines elicited high-titer ELISA and neutralizing antibody responses far greater than those generated by virus infection. However, neither antibody titers nor lymphoproliferative responses reproducibly correlated with the pattern of recurrent disease."
CD010864,0,8509855,0,Plasma D-dimer: a useful tool for evaluating suspected pulmonary embolus.,"Although ventilation-perfusion lung scanning is widely used in evaluating patients with suspected pulmonary embolus, additional rapid screening tests are needed to supplement scintigraphy in patients in whom the scan is indeterminate or the scan results are discordant with clinical suspicion. D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product which should be elevated in the presence of intravascular coagulation. We prospectively studied patients referred for lung scanning by obtaining a plasma D-dimer latex agglutination assay at the time of the scan. Of 64 patients who had pulmonary angiography to confirm the diagnosis, 16 were positive for pulmonary embolus and only one had a normal D-dimer. The D-dimer was normal in 27 of 48 patients without embolus and elevated in 21. Although an elevated D-dimer level is a nonspecific finding, we conclude that a normal D-dimer is a good negative predictor for pulmonary embolus, with a negative predictive value of 0.97."

Clinical information, laboratory tests such as a D-dimer and imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) angiography, ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy or echocardiography help to establish clinical probability and the severity of the disease. With all this information, risk scores can be constructed, such as the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) score, which has high sensitivity in predicting mortality. Treatment should be started immediately with heparin, usually low molecular weight heparin. If the patient is at high risk, thrombolytic therapy is indicated, although possible contraindications should be thoroughly assessed. Supportive treatment may be considered in a few patients."
CD010864,0,18088236,0,Anti-(apolipoprotein A-1) IgGs are associated with high levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein in acute coronary syndrome.,"ApoA-1 (apolipoprotein A-1) is the main component of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) and stabilizes PON-1 (paraoxonase-1), which prevents lipid peroxidation and oxLDL (oxidized low-density lipoprotein) formation. Autoantibodies against apoA-1 [anti-(apoA-1) IgG] have been found in antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosous, two diseases with an increased risk of thrombotic events, as well as in ACS (acute coronary syndrome). OxLDL levels are also elevated in these diseases. Whether anti-(apoA-1) IgGs exist in other prothrombotic conditions, such as APE (acute pulmonary embolism) and stroke, has not been studied and their potential association with oxLDL and PON-1 activity is not known. In the present study, we determined prospectively the prevalence of anti-(apoA-1) IgG in patients with ACS (n=127), APE (n=58) and stroke (n=34), and, when present, we tested their association with oxLDL levels. The prevalance of anti-(apoA-1) IgG was 11% in the ACS group, 2% in the control group and 0% in the APE and stroke groups. The ACS group had significantly higher median anti-(apoA-1) IgG titres than the other groups of patients. Patients with ACS positive for anti-(apoA-1) IgG had significantly higher median oxLDL values than those who tested negative (226.5 compared with 47.7 units/l; P<0.00001) and controls. The Spearman ranked test revealed a significant correlation between anti-(apoA-1) IgG titres and serum oxLDL levels (r=0.28, P<0.05). No association was found between PON-1 activity and oxLDL or anti-(apoA-1) IgG levels. In conclusion, anti-(apoA-1) IgG levels are positive in ACS, but not in stroke or APE. In ACS, their presence is associated with higher levels of oxLDL and is directly proportional to the serum concentration of oxLDL. These results emphasize the role of humoral autoimmunity as a mediator of inflammation and coronary atherogenesis."
CD010864,0,18278191,0,Combined use of clinical pre-test probability and D-dimer test in the diagnosis of preoperative deep venous thrombosis in colorectal cancer patients.,"The preoperative prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with colorectal cancer may be as high as 8%. In order to minimize the risk of pulmonary embolism, it is important to rule out preoperative DVT. A large study has confirmed that a negative D-dimer test in combination with a low clinical pre-test probability (PTP) can be safely used to rule out the tentative diagnosis of DVT in cancer patients. However, the accuracy in colorectal cancer patients is uncertain. This study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a quantitative D-dimer assay in combination with the PTP score in ruling out preoperative DVT in colorectal cancer patients admitted for surgery. Preoperative D-dimer test and compression ultrasonography for DVT were performed in 193 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer. Diagnostic accuracy indices of the D-dimer test were assessed according to the PTP score. The negative predictive value, positive predictive value, sensitivity and specificity were 99% (95% confidence interval (CI), 95-100%), 17% (95% CI, 9-26), 93% (95% CI, 68-100%) and 61% (95% CI, 53-68%), respectively.

Fibrinogen, plasminogen, alpha-2-antiplasmin, fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were closely monitored before and after each administration of APSAC. Median angiographic improvement was 50% (range 0-94%). The following adverse events were reported: bleeding at puncture sites (n = 12), haematuria (n = 1), epistaxis (n = 3), fever (n = 2). A blood transfusion was given in one patient with an inguinal haematoma. Systemic fibrinogenolysis occurred in 20/28 patients."
CD010864,0,11484095,0,Fibrin monomer could be a useful predictor of pulmonary embolism after total hip arthroplasty: preliminary report.,"We examined 17 total hip arthroplasty patients in order to develop a method for the predictive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) after joint arthroplasty. Scintigraphy revealed the presence of PE in 4 patients. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), antithrombin III (ATIII), and thrombin-AT III complex (TAT) did not show significant differences between patients with and without PE. D-dimer 7 days after surgery showed significant differences between patients with and without PE. Fibrin monomer (FM) increased sharply after surgery, and it was significantly different between the patients with and without PE immediately after surgery and 2 days after surgery. Our findings suggest the importance of FM in the predictive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism after total hip arthroplasty, and 40 microg/ml or higher levels with our measurement method could represent a high-risk condition."
CD010864,0,1602254,0,[Significance of the determination of D-dimers in venous thrombo-embolic disease].,"Plasma measurement of D-dimers (DD) with the Elisa technique is very useful in the diagnostic approach of venous thromboembolic diseases: a low level of plasma D-dimers (500 micrograms/l when using the Elisa from Stago) allows to exclude the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism with predictive values of 94% and 98%, respectively. Such a diagnostic potential is particularly useful in the group of patients with inconclusive perfusion-ventilation scintigraphy (low or indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism) which represent more than 50% of the patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Presence of pulmonary embolism is suggested by levels above 4.000 micrograms/l in the collective of outpatients who are urgently referred because of clinical suspicion of embolism."

CD010864,0,21549901,0,[Risk factors for recurrent venous thromboembolism].,"Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is frequent and can be fatal. Long-term antithrombotic treatment reduces the risk of recurrent VTE but increases the risk of bleeding and, therefore, cannot be proposed for all patients. Predicting the probability of recurrence in an individual patient is of utmost importance for assessing the risk-benefit ratio of long-term anticoagulation. Multiple clinical risk factors for recurrent VTE have been identified which include: unprovoked first episode, anatomical proximal location, male gender, residual venous thrombosis, cancer and antiphospholipid syndrome. d-dimer level after discontinuation of oral anticoagulation can help to predict the risk of recurrence with a good negative predictive value. Finally, genetic polymorphisms and rare inherited deficiencies of natural anticoagulant proteins do not seem to be strongly associated to recurrence. New antithrombotic drugs may, in the near future, improve the safety and of long-term anticoagulation treatment."

CD010864,0,21110099,0,Feasibility of gadolinium-enhanced dual energy CT pulmonary angiography: a pilot study in rabbits.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of gadolinium-enhanced dual energy CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to detect pulmonary embolism (PE) in rabbits. Dual energy CT was performed on phantoms composed of different dilution of gadolinium and iodinated contrast agents, CT numbers of the phantoms were measured at different tube voltages. Ten rabbits, which were subdivided into two groups receiving 3 or 5Â ml/kg of gadolinium based contrast agent (nÂ =Â 5 for each group), underwent baseline gadolinium-enhanced dual energy CTPA. The CT numbers of pulmonary arteries were measured. The following day, sponge gelatin was injected into femoral vein of 6 rabbits to create pulmonary emboli. The rabbit were re-imaged 2Â h after sponge gelatin injection. Histopathology analysis of the lung lobes was performed. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Serum creatinine levels were measured on day 1 before gadolinium contrast media injection, and on day 2 prior to PE creation. The phantoms and animal study showed that the CT numbers of gadolinium-based contrast agent and pulmonary arteries at 80Â kVp were higher than those at 140Â kVp and average weighted 120Â kVp. In 6 rabbits, CTPA showed bilateral pulmonary artery emboli, and the reconstructed gadolinium maps showed decreased pulmonary perfusion in the corresponding lung lobes. With the histopathology results as the reference standards, CTPA and Blood flow imaging (BFI) detected PE in 14 and 14 of the 14 pulmonary lobes, 26, 24 lobes without PE, respectively, corresponding to sensitivities of 100 and 100%, and specificities of 100 and 92%, respectively. Serum creatinine level increased by 6.7 and 20.6% in the rabbits receiving 3 and 5Â ml/kg gadolinium based contrast medium respectively. Histopathological analysis found no significant tubular necrosis at either gadolinium dose. Gadolinium-enhanced dual energy CT pulmonary angiography is feasible and it can simultaneously provide information on pulmonary artery and lung perfusion in a rabbit model of PE."

CD010864,0,14652656,0,Markers of endothelial activation and atherothrombosis in women with history of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension.,"Women who have had preeclampsia (PE) or gestational hypertension (GH) exhibit relatively high rates of circulatory diseases. PE is a disease associated with inflammation and vascular endothelial dysfunction. We therefore hypothesised that women with a history of PE or GH might have abnormal levels of markers of endothelial activation or inflammation, reflecting either an innate predisposition to preeclampsia or changes induced by the eclamptic process. Levels of von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein were compared in 392 women with a history of PE between 1951 and 1970, 297 women with a history of GH and 163 matched controls. Although no significant differences between those with either PE or GH and controls were noted, subjects with a history of PE had significantly higher CRP values than those with GH. No significant differences were found when the three groups were compared for von Willebrand factor or fibrinogen. Overall, the data do not support our hypothesis. In addition, our data document increasing von Willebrand factor levels increase with age, which may help explain the age dependent increase in venous or arterial thrombosis. Moderate alcohol consumption was also associated with lower levels of inflammatory markers."

However, pulmonary embolism (PE) as a cause of syncope is not common or well recognized. Four aged patients presented to our clinic with episodic syncope, and PE was finally identified as the underlying cause. The significant clinical presentations included transient loss of consciousness and hypoxemia on admission. Syncope with hypoxia should therefore be highlighted as an important clue to the diagnosis of PE in aged patients. A negative D-dimer test will be encountered in patients with a very short history. Repeated D-dimer testing is necessary."

CD010864,0,1911713,0,Both circulating and clot-bound plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 inhibit endogenous fibrinolysis in the rat.,"The effects of both clot-bound and circulating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) on endogenous fibrinolysis were investigated in a rat model of pulmonary embolism. Iodine-125 fibrin(ogen)-labeled blood-clot homogenates were delivered through the left jugular vein to the lung microvasculature, and the subsequent extent of the clot lysis was monitored by measuring the release of 125I-fibrin degradation products (FDPs) into the blood. Clots that had incorporated activated PAI-1 ex vivo were subsequently protected from dissolution in vivo in a dose-responsive manner (half-maximal concentration [IC50] = 4.3 micrograms/ml). PAI-1-containing clots also resisted lysis, as measured by the release of the specific FDP D-dimer. Plasma levels of plasminogen activator (PA) and PAI activity were unaltered by administration of PAI-1-containing clots, and the clot-protective effects of clot-bound PAI-1 were reversed by exogenous tissue-type plasminogen activator administration. Clot lysis was also inhibited in a dose-responsive manner (IC50 = 58 micrograms/kg) by intravenous bolus delivery of activated PAI-1 to the circulation. The clot-protective effects of circulating PAI-1 were correlated with dose-dependent increases in plasma PAI-1 antigen and activity levels and decreases in plasma PA levels (IC50 = 37 micrograms/ml). There was no evidence of any accumulation of circulating PAI-1 in the lungs. Latent PAI-1, whether delivered with or delivered after the clot homogenates, did not affect the clot-lytic process. Activated and latent PAI-1 was cleared from the circulation in a monophasic manner, with a half-life of approximately 32 and 7 minutes, respectively. The results indicate that both clot-bound and circulating PAI-1 are potent inhibitors of fibrinolysis in vivo. Clot-bound PAI-1 may inhibit PAs in the immediate vicinity of the clots, whereas circulating PAI-1 may act systemically by controlling overall levels of PAs present in the blood."
CD010864,0,1467520,0,Activation of human platelets by the rabbit anticardiolipin antibodies.,"Affinity purified anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA) raised in rabbits showed cross-reactivities with various negatively charged phospholipids as shown by both the solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and inhibition studies. In ELISA, ACLA showed strong cross-reactivity to both sphingomyelin (SM) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), but the inhibition studies showed that ACLA failed to bind the aqueous suspensions of SM, PE, and PE/PC (1:1). ACLA bound to resting gel-filtered human platelets (GFP) as shown by both inhibition study and flow cytofluorometric analysis. Western blotting procedure showed that ACLA strongly cross-reacted to an 80-Kd plasma membrane protein. ACLA activated platelet response in a concentration-dependent manner. At less than 10 micrograms/mL, ACLA induced both platelet shape change to spiculate irregular forms as shown by scanning electron microscopy and the phosphorylation of 20-Kd protein. ACLA at more than 10 micrograms/mL caused platelet aggregation and secretion. The aggregation was inhibited by EDTA; aspirin; antimycin A plus 2-deoxyglucose; PGE1; and the F(ab')2 fragment of ACLA. It was not inhibited by monoclonal antibody to Fc receptor (MoAb FcR2). The biochemical events of ACLA-induced platelet response involved the elevation of (1) thromboxane A2 formation, (2) cytosolic free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i), and (3) 47-Kd protein phosphorylation. In addition, the subaggregatory concentration of ACLA showed synergistic platelet activation with that concentration of thrombin, collagen, and epinephrine. The study showed the mechanism involved in ACLA-induced platelet responses."

CD010864,0,14573653,0,PPE antigen Rv2430c of Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces a strong B-cell response.,"The variation in sequence and length in the C-terminal region among members of the unique PE (Pro-Glu) and PPE (Pro-Pro-Glu) protein families of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a likely source of antigenic variation, giving rise to the speculation that these protein families could be immunologically important. Based on in silico analysis, we selected a hypothetical open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein belonging to the PPE family and having epitopes with predictably higher antigenic indexes. Reverse transcriptase PCR using total RNA extracted from in vitro-cultured M. tuberculosis H37Rv generated an mRNA product corresponding to this gene, indicating the expression of this ORF (Rv2430c) at the mRNA level. Recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli was used to screen the sera of M. tuberculosis-infected patients, as well as those of clinically healthy controls (n = 10), by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The panel of patient sera comprised sera from fresh infection cases (category 1; n = 32), patients with relapsed tuberculosis (category 2; n = 30), and extrapulmonary cases (category 3; n = 30). Category 2 and 3 sera had strong antibody responses to the PPE antigen, equal to or higher than those to other well-known antigens, such as Hsp10 or purified protein derivative (PPD). However, a higher percentage of patients belonging to category 1, as opposed to clinically healthy controls, showed stronger antibody response against the PPE protein when probed with anti-immunoglobulin M (IgM) (71 versus 37.5%) or anti-IgG (62.5 versus 28.12%). Our results reveal that this PPE ORF induces a strong B-cell response compared to that generated by M. tuberculosis Hsp10 or PPD, pointing to the immunodominant nature of the protein."

A precision study showed total coefficients of variation ranging from 2.7 to 11.1% with the BCS Analyzer and from 2.5 to 6.6% with the BCT Analyzer. We investigated the ability of D-Dimer PLUS to exclude venous thromboembolism in 312 outpatients suspected of either pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis. Three months follow-up was available for all patients. With the BCS Analyzer, we determined a cut-off value of 190 ng/ml, which gave a sensitivity of 97.9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 92.6-99.7%], a specificity of 37.9% (95% CI, 30.9-43.8%) and a negative predictive value of 97.6% (95% CI, 91.7-99.7%). With the BCT Analyzer, at a cut-off value of 130 ng/ml, sensitivity was 96.8% (95% CI, 91.0-99.3%), specificity was 45.2% (95% CI, 38.5-51.2%) and the negative predictive value was 97% (95% CI, 91.6-99.4).

CD010864,0,11027491,0,Amyloid beta protein starting pyroglutamate at position 3 is a major component of the amyloid deposits in the Alzheimer's disease brain.,"The amyloid beta protein (Abeta) deposited in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain is heterogeneous at both its amino and carboxyl termini. Recent studies of the genetic forms of AD indicate that the aggregation and deposition of Abeta42 may be a common initiating event in all forms of AD. Here, we analyzed the amino termini of the Abeta species deposited in the AD brain, focusing specifically on species with amino-terminal pyroglutamate at position 3 (Abeta3(pE)). Immunocytochemical analysis of AD brains with an antibody specific for Abeta3(pE) confirmed that these species deposit in blood vessels and senile plaques. Using specific sandwich ELISAs, we determined the amounts of Abeta3(pE)-40 and Abeta3(pE)-42(43) in AD brain compared with other forms. This analysis showed that Abeta3(pE)-40 is closely correlated with the extent of Abeta deposition in blood vessels, whereas Abeta3(pE)-42(43) is not. In addition, Abeta3(pE)-42(43) is an important component of the Abeta deposited in senile plaques of the AD brain, constituting approximately 25% of the total Abeta42(43). In vitro comparison of Abeta1-42 and Abeta3(pE)-42 showed that Abeta3(pE)-42 is highly prone to oligomerization. These findings suggest that Abeta3(pE)-42 may be particularly important in AD pathogenesis."
CD010864,0,21683643,0,"Combined analyses of creatine kinase MB, cardiac troponin I and myoglobin in pericardial and cerebrospinal fluids to investigate myocardial and skeletal muscle injury in medicolegal autopsy cases.","Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and myoglobin (Mb) are biochemical markers of myocardial injury; however, Mb is more abundant in skeletal muscles. The present study involved analysis of these markers in pericardial and cerebrospinal fluids (PCF and CSF) from serial medicolegal autopsy cases (n=295, within 48h) to examine their efficacy in determining the cause of death. Although these markers showed a slight postmortem time-dependent elevation, except for CK-MB in CSF, the distribution depended on the cause of death. Mb levels in PCF and CSF were higher in fatal hyperthermia (heat stroke) and methamphetamine abuse, and CK-MB in both fluids was also higher in the latter. In psychotropic drug intoxication, CK-MB, cTnI and Mb were higher in PCF, but only cTnI was elevated in CSF. In electrocution and cerebrovascular disease, each marker was higher in PCF and also relatively high in CSF. PCF cTnI level was higher in acute pulmonary embolism without significant elevation of any other markers, whereas CSF CK-MB was higher in acute blunt brain injury death and methamphetamine abuse. In most cases of delayed brain injury death, hypothermia (cold exposure) and pneumonia, these markers were low or intermediate in both PCF and CSF; however, sudden cardiac death, asphyxiation and fire fatality cases showed few characteristic findings. These observations suggest that combined analyses of these markers in postmortem PCF and CSF, in addition to blood samples, are helpful for evaluating the severity of myocardial and/or skeletal muscle damage in death processes, in particular for investigating deaths due to hyperthermia, hypothermia, electrocution and intoxication."

CD010864,0,2875646,0,Rapid detection of cross-linked fibrin degradation products in plasma using monoclonal antibody-coated latex particles.,"Conformational and structural changes on conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and its cross-linking by Factor XIIIa lead to the development of new antigenic determinants that permit differentiation between their plasminolytic cleavage products. A monoclonal antibody (DD-3B6/22) that is specific for cross-linked fibrin derivatives containing the D dimer configuration has been used in developing a latex agglutination procedure that can detect fibrin degradation products in either plasma or serum. Fibrinogen or its degradation products do not cross-react with this antibody. Results were calibrated with an enzyme immunoassay, which used a purified D dimer standard. Plasmas from 40 normal subjects, all having D dimer levels below 250 ng/mL measured by enzyme immunoassay, were all negative by latex assay. In contrast, positive latex agglutination titers were obtained with 87 of 88 patients with demonstrated deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Compared to enzyme immunoassay, latex agglutination assay is less sensitive, but this latex procedure provides a rapid and less elaborate test for elevated levels of cross-linked fibrin degradation products in patients with thrombosis. Plasma assays for fibrin degradation products are preferable to those using serum."

CD010864,0,17171598,0,Risk stratification of acute pulmonary embolism.,"Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition, with an overall 3-month mortality rate of 15% and with right ventricular failure as the most common cause of early death. Risk stratification facilitates identification of high-risk patients and may be helpful in guiding the initial and long-term management. In patients with massive PE and hemodynamic instability, rapid risk assessment is paramount and bedside echocardiography and multislice chest computed tomography (CT) are useful for identifying patients who may benefit from thrombolysis or embolectomy. Cardiac biomarkers, including troponin and the natriuretic peptides, are sensitive markers of right ventricular function. Low levels of troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and NT-terminal proBNP are all highly sensitive assays for identifying patients with an uneventful clinical course. Multislice chest CT is not only useful to diagnose or exclude PE; it also is useful for risk assessment. A right-to-left ventricular dimension ratio > 0.9 on the reconstructed CT four-chamber view identifies patients at increased risk of early death. This article focuses on risk stratification tools, including the clinical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography, cardiac biomarkers, and chest CT."

However, little information is available about IL-16 function in human pregnancy. In this study, we collected maternal blood samples from 125 pregnant women between 26 and 41 wk of gestation, 63 from normal pregnant women and 62 from women with preeclampsia (PE). Serum IL-16C levels were measured by ELISA. We also examined IL-16C and IL-16N immunostaining in maternal vessels and protein expression in leukocytes from normal and PE pregnant women. In addition, IL-16C production by placental trophoblasts was also determined. Our results showed that IL-16C levels were significantly higher in severe PE than in mild PE and normal pregnant controls, 515 +/- 58 vs 287 +/- 46 (p < 0.05) and 163 +/- 9 pg/ml (p < 0.01), respectively, indicating that increased IL-16 levels in PE is associated with the severity of the disease. There was no difference for the IL-16C levels in normal pregnant women throughout the third trimester. The correlation of maternal IL-16C levels with labor and body mass index was also analyzed. IL-16C levels were neither associated with labor nor associated with body mass index. Moreover, increased IL-16C immunostaining in maternal vessel endothelium and enhanced IL-16C protein expression in leukocytes were observed in PE. We also found that IL-16C production was increased by trophoblasts from PE placentas. Our study demonstrated up-regulation of the IL-16 profile in both the maternal and the placental systems in PE, suggesting that IL-16 could be an important cytokine engaged in the altered immune system and exaggerated inflammatory response in PE syndrome."

In a prospective management study we investigated the safety and efficiency of excluding PE by a normal D-dimer combined with a low or moderate clinical probability. Of the 202 study patients this combination ruled out PE in 64 (32%) patients. The 3-month thromboembolic risk in these patients was 0% (95% CI, 0.0-5.6%). The prevalence of PE in the entire cohort was 29% (59 patients), whereas in the low, moderate and high clinical probability groups this was 25%, 26% and 50%, respectively. We conclude that ruling out suspected PE by a normal D-dimer combined with a low or moderate clinical probability appears to be a safe and efficient strategy.

Spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) within the cardiac chambers is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. However, most studies have examined the relationship between left atrial SEC and systemic thromboembolic disease. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed in 210 patients with NVAF to assess a risk of thromboembolism. Right atrial SEC was detected in 37 patients, and 35 of these patients with RA-SEC and 29 patients without RA-SEC were enrolled in this study. However, patients with a history of symptomatic PE or deep vein thrombosis were excluded. Spontaneous echo contrast was diagnosed by TEE as the presence of smoke-like echoes that swirled in a circular pattern. PE was diagnosed by pulmonary scintigraphy. Thrombotic and thrombolytic parameters, including serum concentrations of plasmin-alpha-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), D-dimer, and fibrinogen were measured in all patients. Left ventricular dimension, cardiac function, and hematologic parameters were similar in the two groups. Nevertheless, the incidence of perfusion defects in pulmonary scintigraphy was significantly higher in the group with RA-SEC (40%) than in the group without RA-SEC (7%; chi-square, P=0.006).

Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised into four dietary groups for 3 weeks: Zn control (ZC; 30 mg Zn/kg); Zn marginally deficient (ZMD; 9 mg Zn/kg); Zn deficient (ZD; < 1 mg Zn/kg); pair fed (PF; 30 mg Zn/kg) to the ZD group. Morphology of cauda epididymal sperm and lipid profiles of testis phospholipids were analysed. The rats fed the ZD diet had a lower testis weight (P < 0.02). Seminal vesicles and prostate weight were also lower in the ZD and PF groups. Rats fed the ZD diet, but not the ZMD diet, had 34-35 % more abnormal spermatozoa and 24 % shorter sperm tail length than the ZC and PF rats (P < 0.001). Testis cholesterol concentration was higher in the ZD rats compared with the ZC and PF rats (P < 0.04). Testes were highly enriched with n-6 fatty acids by showing n-6 : n-3 fatty acid ratios of 27:1 in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 23:1 in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The dominant fatty acid in testes was docosapentaenoic acid (22 : 5n-6), comprising 15 and 24 % of PC and PE, respectively. This fatty acid was significantly lower in the ZD rats, whereas 18 : 2n-6 was higher compared with the rats in the other diet groups. These results demonstrate that severe Zn deficiency adversely affects sperm integrity and modulates testis fatty acid composition by interrupting essential fatty acid metabolism. This suggests that Zn deficiency-associated abnormal testicular function is perhaps preceded by altered membrane fatty acid composition, especially of a major fatty acid, 22 : 5n-6."

CD010864,0,15832234,0,Impact of aspirate smears and trephine biopsies in routine bone marrow diagnostics: a comparative study of 141 cases.,"The diagnostic impact of bone marrow cytology in combination with flow cytometry analysis of aspirate smears and bone marrow histology together with immunohistochemical examination of trephine biopsies was compared in 141 routine cases. Diagnoses achieved by the two methods were concordant in 80.5% of cases. In discordant cases, clinical follow-up data of at least one year confirmed the correctness of cytological and histological diagnoses. For infiltration by malignant disease, both methods were concordant in 86.5% of samples and correlated well for the degree of infiltration (r = 0.64, p <0.001). Overall, regression analysis showed a good correlation for cellularity (r = 0.67) lymphopoiesis (r = 0.75), granulopoiesis (r = 0.73) and megakaryopoiesis (r = 0.65) while erythropoiesis displayed a lower degree of correlation (r = 0.43, all p <0.001). Regression analysis on all immunological data obtained by flow cytometry (FC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed a good overall linear correlation (r = 0.67, p <0.001), but significant differences were found for a few phenotypic markers. Furthermore, the correlation was found to be dependent on IgG subclasses and the fluorochromes used for FC. Thus, analyses with IgG2 antibodies and phycoerythrin (PE) as fluorochrome showed significantly more expression than IHC. In conclusion, cytology and histology, both in association with the respective immunophenotyping, are of equal value in bone marrow diagnostics and should be used in combination. However, in some specific settings, one of the two procedures might be preferable."
CD010864,0,18854191,0,Sensitive detection of hydrophobic antigens using a novel lipid-aggregate based ELISA.,"Antibodies against hydrophobic antigens are common in several autoimmune diseases. However, detection of such antibodies by standard immune-assays, such as ELISA, is problematic, in part because of the problems with coating hydrophobic molecules onto polystyrene multi-well plates. We describe a novel method of stably associating hydrophobic antigens to ELISA plates. By mixing the antigen with a hydrophobic molecule containing a hydrophilic anchor, we generate mixed lipid aggregates that can attach to ELISA plates, and are resistant to detergent wash. Using the ganglioside GM-1 and phosphatidylethanolamine conjugated to the hapten DNP (dinitrophenyl) as model antigens, we show that hydrophobic antigens incorporated into mixed lipid aggregates expose their antigenic determinants in a correct configuration. The detection limit of both GM-1 and DNP-PE was considerably improved compared to when these antigens were coated on ELISA plates using organic solvents. Furthermore GM-1 incorporated into mixed lipid aggregates can be detected by specific antibodies in patient serum. The method of incorporating hydrophobic antigens into mixed lipid aggregates for stable association to ELISA plates can presumably be applied to a vast array of hydrophobic antigens, and may well be developed into a large scale screening system for serum reactivity towards different hydrophobic antigens."
CD010864,0,8259539,0,A comparative analysis of D-dimer assays in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism.,"To avoid angiography in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism and non-diagnostic lung scan results, the use of D-dimer has been advocated. We assessed plasma samples of 151 consecutive patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism. Lung scan results were: normal (43), high probability (48) and non-diagnostic (60; angiography performed in 43; 12 pulmonary emboli). Reproducibility, cut-off values, specificity, and percentage of patients in whom angiography could be avoided (with sensitivity 100%) were determined for two latex and four ELISA assays. The latex methods (cut-off 500 micrograms/l) agreed with corresponding ELISA tests in 83% (15% normal latex, abnormal ELISA) and 81% (7% normal latex, abnormal ELISA). ELISA methods showed considerable within- (2-17%) and between-assay variation (12-26%). Cut-off values were 25 micrograms/l (Behring), 50 micrograms/l (Agen), 300 micrograms/l (Stago) and 550 micrograms/l (Organon). Specificity was 14-38%; in 4-15% of patients angiography could be avoided. We conclude that latex D-dimer assays appear not useful, whereas ELISA methods may be of limited value in the exclusion of pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,21682699,0,Circulating levels of the anti-angiogenic thrombospondin 2 are elevated in pre-eclampsia.,"An imbalance of maternal circulating pro- and anti-angiogenic factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Thrombospondin 2 (TSP-2) is a protein expressed mainly by activated endothelial cells, which acts as a potent anti-angiogenic agent. Our aim was to determine whether serum TSP-2 levels are altered in pre-eclampsia. We enrolled 35 pre-eclamptic patients and 35 healthy pregnant women in the study. Thrombospondin 2 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) concentrations were determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. In patients with PE, we demonstrated 1.7-fold higher TSP-2 [13.2 (9.4-18.1) vs. 7.9 (7.2-11.2) ng/ml, p<0.001], 3.8-fold higher sFlt-1 and 4.3-fold lower PlGF levels compared with the control group. There were no associations between TSP-2 and sFlt-1 or PlGF concentrations. We suggest that circulating TSP-2 levels may contribute to the pathogenesis of PE via its anti-angiogenic properties, but in a distinct way from sFlt-1 and PlGF."

CD010864,0,7740515,0,"Comparison of the efficacy of D-dimer, fibrin degradation products and prothrombin fragment 1+2 in clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis.","The diagnostic efficacy of D-dimer, fibrin degradation products (FbDP) and prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) in patients with clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was investigated. 161 patients suspected of DVT were investigated. The diagnosis DVT was made in 58 patients using isotope leg scanning and ultrasonic duplex scanning. In all patients D-dimer, FbDP and F1+2 levels were determined using a latex method for D-dimer and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (EIA) for FbDP and F1+2. For the D-dimer latex assay sensitivity was 69% and specificity 92% (cut-off level 500 ng/ml). For the FbDP assay sensitivity was 100% and specificity 8% (cut-off level 250 ng/ml). For the F1+2 assay sensitivity was 100% and specificity 17% (cut-off level 0.3 nM). Specificity could not be improved by the combination of FbDP and F1+2. We conclude that in our population the use of the latex D-dimer assay, FbDP and F1+2 EIA's have no value as screening tests to rule out the diagnosis DVT in clinically suspected patients."
CD010864,0,8160639,0,Incidence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.,"The incidence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was studied. Antiphospholipid antibodies were measured in the sera of 93 patients (49 women, 44 men; mean age 70 [+/- 21] years) with MGUS by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The phospholipids tested were cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Positive results were defined as a value higher than the number of multiples of the mean per phospholipid, which included 76 of 80 (95%; 20 age-matched) control individuals. The immunoglobulin-G (IgG) or IgM antiphospholipid antibodies isotype varied among the patients, as did the phospholipid specificity. For IgG, PI was found elevated in 32% of the MGUS samples, whereas the other phospholipid antigens ranged from 9% to 15%. The percentage of patients with IgM antiphospholipid antibodies was higher. The authors observed PS, PI, PA, and PC as positive in 45%, 35%, 25%, and 25% of patients, respectively. Of the 12 sera studied for IgA isotype, three (25%) were positive for PS, six (50%) for CL, and none for PE. Patients with MGUS manifested a significantly higher (P < .01) incidence of antiphospholipid antibodies in their blood than did the control persons. No difference in the incidence of antiphospholipid antibodies was seen between younger and older (age-matched) control patients. No correlation was found between serum levels of immunoglobulins and optical density reading of the blank plates used as ELISA controls."
CD010864,0,7816716,0,Suspected pulmonary embolism. The difficulties of diagnostic evaluation.,"It is impossible to prove or disprove a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism on clinical grounds. Diagnostic evaluation is best carried out by first attempting to identify a provable alternative diagnosis that can explain a patient's symptoms. Once the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is seriously considered, a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is the next step. A positive (""high-probability"") or negative (""normal-perfusion"") scan is an appropriate diagnostic end point. Unfortunately, most V/Q scans are nondiagnostic, and the workup must be pursued further. Color-flow (duplex) ultrasound, if available, is the next logical step. If a site of deep venous thrombosis cannot be identified, pulmonary angiography is indicated. Newer methods, such as D-dimer measurement and spiral computed tomography, are being studied."

CD010864,0,10870805,0,Markers of hemostatic system activation in pulmonary embolism. Changes during and after cessation of anticoagulant treatment.,"Plasma levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 (Fl+2), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) and D-dimers were measured in 15 patients with pulmonary embolism during heparin therapy, oral anticoagulation, and after cessation of warfarin therapy. Each patient had a favorable outcome during anticoagulant therapy (3 months), but late venous thromboembolism occurred in six cases. The mean levels of the three markers were significantly increased on day 4 after the thrombotic event, and normalized during warfarin therapy. Nine months after the initial pulmonary embolism, mean levels of the three markers, as compared with a control population, were significantly higher in the patients with late recurrences, whereas only TAT were slightly higher in patients without recurrences as compared with controls. Only TAT levels were significantly higher in the patients with late recurrences than in those without late recurrences. Thus, the levels of the three markers 9 months after pulmonary embolism seem to be interesting to identify patients with high risk of recurrence and who might require longer anticoagulant treatment."
CD010864,0,10443963,0,Antiphospholipid syndrome and thrombosis.,"Antiphospholipid antibodies [such as anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA)] are strongly associated with thrombosis and appear to be the most common of the acquired blood protein defects causing thrombosis. Although the precise mechanism(s) whereby antiphospholipid antibodies alter hemostasis to induce a hypercoagulable state remain unclear, several theories have been advanced. The most common thrombotic events associated with ACLA are deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus (type I syndrome), coronary or peripheral artery thrombosis (type II syndrome) or cerebrovascular/retinal vessel thrombosis (type III syndrome), and occasionally patients present with mixtures (type IV syndrome). Type V patients are those with antiphospholipid antibodies and fetal wastage syndrome. It is as yet unclear how many seemingly normal individuals who may never develop manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (type VI) harbor asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibodies. The relative frequency of ACLA in association with arterial and venous thrombosis strongly suggests that these should be looked for in any individual with unexplained thrombosis; all three idiotypes (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be assessed. Also, the type of syndrome (I through VI) should be defined, if possible, as this may dictate both type and duration of both immediate and long-term anticoagulant therapy. Unlike those with ACLA, patients with primary lupus anticoagulant thrombosis syndrome usually suffer venous thrombosis. Because the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is unreliable in patients with lupus anticoagulant (prolonged in only about 40 to 50% of patients) and is not usually prolonged in patients with anticardiolipin antibodies, definitive tests including ELISA for ACLA, the dRVVT for lupus anticoagulant, hexagonal phospholipid neutralization procedure, and B-2-GP-I (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be immediately ordered when suspecting antiphospholipid syndrome or in individuals with otherwise unexplained thrombotic or thromboembolic events. If these are negative, in the appropriate clinical setting, subgroups should also be assessed. Finally, most patients with antiphospholipid thrombosis syndrome will fail warfarin therapy and, except for retinal vascular thrombosis, most will fail antiplatelet therapy, thus it is of major importance to make this diagnosis in order that patients can be treated with the most effective therapy for secondary prevention, low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UHF) in most instances."

CD010864,0,16236872,0,Latex-enhanced immunoassay d-dimer and blood gases can exclude pulmonary embolism in low-risk patients presenting to an acute care setting.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is common, and diagnosis is often difficult. Investigation has traditionally required expensive imaging procedures that are frequently nondiagnostic. Consequently, current practice favors noninvasive diagnosis of PE using algorithms combining risk assessment and d-dimer. Despite the proven safety of this approach, concern persists about such strategies to exclude PE, largely due to variable d-dimer sensitivity. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the safety of a new algorithm combining a novel, rapid d-dimer test (IL Test; Instrumentation Laboratory; Lexington, MA), Pa(O2) measurement, and risk factor assessment in excluding PE in subjects presenting to an acute care setting."

In 76 patients with DMD who had no complications during examination, the CK and LDH levels were examined in a total of 173 times. Both enzyme levels were elevated and highly correlated (R = 0.93). We examined the temporal alteration of serum CK and LDH levels during episodes of pulmonary thrombosis experienced in 7 DMD patients who fulfilled the following diagnostic criteria: 1. sudden onset of dyspnea, chest pain, and hypoxia; 2. abnormal coagulation profile or abnormal chest CT findings, such as peripheral wedged shaped shadow and; 3. pneumothorax ruled out from X-ray findings. Throughout the episode of pulmonary thrombosis, CK and LDH levels changed within the range of those from DMD patients who had no complications, however, the CK level was significantly elevated from the basal level (2.12 times, p = 0.0075) on the first day of the episode. The LDH level rose for several days, and subsequently both CK and LDH returned to the basal level. In patients with compartment syndrome, CK levels were reportedly elevated due to muscle fiber necrosis which lead a hypercoagulative state. Therefore, we propose that muscle fiber necrosis is one of causal factors in pulmonary thrombosis. In addition, elevated CK may be helpful in predicting pulmonary thrombosis."

Preincubation of the sample with EDTA-2Na before ELISA was employed to inhibit PE activity which hydrolyzes the anti-PE IgG antibody into a smaller molecular form. The PE levels of 10 middle ear effusions (MEE) from chronic otitis media with effusion were also measured. In CSOM, 9 of 10 samples had significant PE levels, ranging from 6.8 to 62.1 micrograms/ml, which were significantly higher than those in MEE (p less than 0.01), the majority of which was below the detection limit. Two samples of CSOM with the P. aeruginosa infection showed high PE levels. This sandwich ELISA for the measurement of PE is a very sensitive method requiring only a small sample amount."

CD010864,0,21307004,0,Elevated cardiac biomarkers with normal right ventricular size indicate an unlikely diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in stable patients.,"The purpose of this investigation is to assess the prevalence of elevated cardiac biomarkers, with or without estimates of right ventricular (RV) size, in stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Our hypothesis is that the combination of high levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), high creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), and normal size RV are sufficiently uncommon in stable patients with PE to make the diagnosis of PE unlikely. Retrospective review showed a high cTnI plus high CK-MB in 20 (3.4%) of 585 stable patients with acute PE. A high cTnI plus high CK-MB with normal RV size was shown in 5 (1.9%) of 264 patients. In stable patients with such findings, therefore, PE is unlikely and other diagnoses, particularly acute coronary syndrome, should be considered before pursuing a diagnosis of PE."
CD010864,0,3242823,0,Hemoglobinuria detection in 195 urology patients.,"There is a definite need for the development of a specific and sensitive diagnostic test for the detection of hematuria in patients with bladder and kidney cancer. It is well established that hemoglobin in the urine may be indicative of bladder and/or kidney cancer as well as other types of lesions of the urinary tract. We have developed a specific and sensitive immunological assay for the detection of human hemoglobin in urine. This test has several important advantages over the currently used chemical tests. A mouse monoclonal antibody specific for human hemoglobin was produced and used in the development of a double-antibody biotinylated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that specifically detected hemoglobin in the urine of 195 urology patients. The results from this assay were compared with data from an evaluation of the same specimen using a polyclonal antibody biotinylated ELISA (PE) as well as a dipstick test in a blind screening study. The monoclonal antibody biotinylated ELISA (ME) possessed a much higher level of sensitivity and specificity over the dipstick test. In addition, we determined that monoclonal as well as polyclonal antibody can detect not only normal hemoglobin but also abnormal hemoglobins in urine. Of the total 195 urology patients in all diagnostic categories, the ME test was positive for detection of hemoglobin in 28 more patients (35% more) than were detected by the dipstick test. Importantly, four of these 28 patients detected by the ME but undetected by the dipstick were patients with bladder or kidney cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010864,0,9700846,0,A new quantitative D-dimer assay appropriate in emergency: reliability of the assay for pulmonary embolism exclusion diagnosis.,"Plasma D-dimers, degradation products of cross-linked fibrin, are elevated in several thrombotic diseases. In the last decade, their measurement has been performed with specific monoclonal antibody based ELISA assay, with a high negative predictive value of such pathologies. However these methods have a low clinical impact since they cannot be used in emergency because they are time consuming and require series. Recently, rapid tests have been proposed with similar accuracy and are feasible for use in emergency conditions. The aim of our study was to evaluate the potential value of a new quantitative rapid assay, based on agglutination of latex microparticles coated with two monoclonal antibodies specific for D-dimers (Liatest D-Di, Diagnostica Stago), in the exclusion diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Eighty-five consecutive suspected PE patients were included in the study. D-dimer determination was performed with both standard ELISA and Liatest D-Di just before pulmonary scintigraphy. Sixty-nine patients were free of PE and 16 had PE. Our results confirm the excellent sensitivity and negative predictive values of the conventional D-dimer ELISA. Using a cut-off value of 500 ng/ml, the sensitivity and the negative predictive values of Liatest D-Di were 94% and 96%, respectively. Only one case of PE had a D-dimer value at 480 ng/ml, close to the cut-off value. This study demonstrates that the Liatest D-Di assay is sensitive enough to be used as the first step in the assessment of PE. However, the best cut-off value has to be determined to get an exclusion diagnosis with certainty."

Fifty-one patients with COPD and a group of 30 healthy volunteers of similar ages were selected and fibrinogen, D-dimer, factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (FvW:Ag and FvW:Rico) levels were compared. We found an increase of all markers in the patient group compared to the healthy control group. The differences found were statistically significant in all cases (p<0.05).

We present our results on WBC differential by flow cytometry (FCM) with a 6 markers, 5 colors CD36-FITC/CD2-PE+CRTH2-PE/CD19-ECD/CD16-Cy5/CD45-Cy7 combination, on 379 subjects, with detection of 12 different circulating cell types, among them 11 were quantified. Detection of quantitative abnormalities of whole leucocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, or lymphocytes was comparable by FCM and by standard cytology in terms of sensitivity and specificity. FCM was better than standard cytology in detection and quantification of circulating blast cells or immature granulocytes, with a first lineage orientation in the former case. All cases of lymphocytosis, with lineage assignment, were detected by FCM. FCM identified a group of patients with excess of CD16pos monocytes as those having an inflammatory syndrome. WBC differential by FCM is at least as reliable as by standard cytology. FCM superiority consists in identification and systematic quantification of parameters that cannot be assessed by standard cytology such as lineage orientation of blast cells or lymphocytes, and expression of markers of interest such as CD16 on inflammatory monocytes."

CD010864,0,12393393,0,Fibrin fragment D-dimer and the risk of future venous thrombosis.,"Plasma D-dimer concentration rises more than 100-fold during acute deep vein thrombosis, but there are no prospective data concerning D-dimer as a risk factor for incident venous thrombosis in a general population. Incident venous thrombosis was ascertained in 2 prospective observational studies, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study. Of 21 690 participants enrolled between 1987 and 1993, after 8 years of follow-up, D-dimer was measured using baseline stored plasma of 307 participants who developed venous thrombosis and 616 who did not. Relative to the first quintile of the distribution of D-dimer, the age-adjusted odds ratios for future venous thrombosis for the second to fifth quintiles of D-dimer were 1.6, 2.3, 2.3, and 4.2, respectively (P for trend <.0001). Following added adjustment for sex, race, body mass index, factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, and elevated factor VIII coagulant activity (factor VIII:c), these odds ratios were 1.5, 2.1, 1.9, and 3.0, respectively (P for trend <.0001). Among those with idiopathic thrombosis or secondary thrombosis unrelated to cancer, the adjusted fifth quintile odds ratios were 3.5 and 4.8, respectively. By contrast, D-dimer in the fifth versus first quintile was not related to occurrence of cancer-associated thrombosis (odds ratio, 1.1). Odds ratios for elevated D-dimer were consistently elevated in subgroups defined by age, sex, race, duration of follow-up, and thrombosis type (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus). D-dimer is strongly and positively related to the occurrence of future venous thrombosis."
CD010864,0,8763675,0,[Diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism].,Several recent studies have clarified the diagnostic strategy for suspected pulmonary embolism. Lung scan is diagnostic in aproximately 30% of patients. The combination of a low clinical probability and a low probability lung scan renders pulmonary embolism unlikely. A plasma D-dimer level lower than 500 micrograms/L measured by an ELISA assay virtually excludes pulmonary embolism. Finding a deep venous thrombosis by lower limb venous compression ultrasonography warrants anticoagulant treatment without resorting to further tests. Pulmonary angiography is usually performed only when the diagnosis remains unclear after noninvasive testing.

CD010864,0,11848459,0,Risk of venous thromboembolism recurrence: high negative predictive value of D-dimer performed after oral anticoagulation is stopped.,"In some patients with previous venous thromboembolism (VTE) D-dimer levels (D-Dimer) tend to increase after oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) is stopped. The aim of our study was to evaluate the predictive value of D-Dimer for the risk of VTE recurrence after OAT withdrawal. After a first episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs and/or pulmonary embolism (PE), 396 patients (median age 67 years, 198 males) were followed from the day of OAT discontinuation for 21 months. D-dimer was measured on the day of OAT withdrawal (T1), 3-4 weeks (T2) and 3 months (+/- 10 days, T3) thereafter. The main outcome events of the study were: objectively documented recurrent DVT and/or PE. D-dimer was found to be increased in 15.5%, 40.3% and 46.2% of the patients at T1, T2 and T3, respectively. In 199 (50.2%) patients, D-dimer levels were elevated in at least one measurement. During a follow-up of 628.4 years, 40 recurrences were recorded (10.1% of patients; 6.4% patient-years of follow-up). D-dimer was increased in at least one measurement in 28 of these cases, but remained normal in 11 subjects (three of whom had recurrent events triggered by circumstantial factors, three with malignancy-associated factors) (in one subject D-dimer was not measured). The negative predictive value (NPV) of D-dimer was 95.6% (95% CI 91.6-98.1) at T3 and was even higher (96.7%; 95% CI 92.9-98.8) after exclusion of the six recurrences due to circumstantial factors. Only five idiopathic recurrences occurred in the 186 patients with consistently normal D-dimer. In conclusion, D-dimer has a high NPV for VTE recurrence when performed after OAT discontinuation."

CD010864,0,9671852,0,Diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis by use of soluble necrosis factor receptor.,"The purpose of this clinical study was to find a relationship between soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary emboli (PE). Clinical diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli is a major dilemma for the clinician. Most existing tests are technician dependent, are expensive, or require sophisticated equipment. Advances in molecular biology will permit investigation of the value of TNF receptor as a test for screening, diagnosis, and evolution of DVT and PE. Forty patients with diagnosis of DVT, documented by real-time ultrasound imaging, were the subject of this clinical study. Five cc of plasma from each patient was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) for measurement of soluble TNF receptor. Significantly increased concentration of plasma-soluble TNF receptor was present in patients with DVT as opposed to normal individuals. There was a close relationship between plasma concentration of soluble TNF receptor and evaluation of the disease. In this preliminary clinical study, it appears that plasma measurement of soluble TNF receptor could be used as a clinical test for diagnosis of DVT and PE."
CD010864,0,7808211,0,Assessing disease prevalence from inaccurate test results: teaching an old dog new tricks.,"Estimates of disease prevalence are needed for the interpretation of test results as well as for public health decisions. Assessing prevalence may be difficult if a definitive test is unavailable, impractical, or expensive. A formula derived from Bayes' theorem can calculate the prevalence of disease in a population by incorporating test results with a knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity of a test. This paper reviews this formula and provides examples evaluating the prevalence of HIV disease, the usefulness of ventilation-perfusion scans in diagnosing pulmonary embolism, and settings where screening tests should not be applied. These examples demonstrate that precise yet inexpensive estimates of disease prevalence are possible by enhancing the usefulness of an inaccurate test."
CD010864,0,10331626,0,Detection of anti-phosphatidylethanolamine antibodies using flow cytometry.,"The finding that lupus anticoagulant (LA) is significantly associated with anti-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) activity has led to great interest in its relation to the clinical features of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Considerable variability has, however, been reported in the prevalence of anti-PE antibodies in APS patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methodology. The lack of standardization and differences in technique may in part explain these discrepancies. PE binds variably to different types of microtiter wells, reflected in the consequent detection, or lack of detection, of anti-PE antibodies. This study describes the use of flow cytometry as an alternative method for the detection of anti-PE antibodies."
CD010864,0,21870873,0,Development of the novel PEG-PE-based polymer for the reversible attachment of specific ligands to liposomes: synthesis and in vitro characterization.,"Surface grafting of liposomes with the wide variety of ligands including antibodies and other proteins is a promising approach for targeted delivery of therapeutics. In this paper, we describe a simple method of synthesizing a hydrazine-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE)-based amphiphilic polymer which can conjugate a variety of ligands via a reversible, pH-cleavable bond. In this method, the targeting ligand is attached to the distal end of the PEG chain, which facilitates its easy access to the targeted site of interaction. The reversible attachment of targeting ligands is useful especially in multifunctional liposomal systems, whereafter successfully performing the function of targeting to the specific site, the bulky ligands, such as proteins or antibodies, are cleaved off in response to an environmental stimulus to expose some other functionalities such as ligands for intracellular penetration or organelle-specific targeting. To investigate the applicability of the protocol, the model ligands monoclonal antinucleosome antibody 2C5 and antimyosin antibody 2G4, and glycoproteins concanavalin A (Con-A) and avidin were conjugated to the synthesized polymer and incorporated into liposomes. In vitro assays including biochemical, enzyme-linked immunosorbent, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry were used to confirm three key characteristics of the modified and/or liposome-attached proteins: successful conjugation of the targeting ligands to the polymer, preservation of specific activity of the ligands after the conjugation and liposome attachment, and the facile pH-sensitive ligand detachment. Monoclonal antibody 2C5 and 2G4, immobilized on the liposome surface, retained their binding affinity to corresponding antigens as confirmed by ELISA. The Con A-bearing liposomes showed significantly higher agglutination in the presence of its substrate mannan compared to plain liposomes (PL) and avidin-functionalized liposomes bound specifically with biotin-agarose. The study on the pH-dependence showed that almost 80% of the hydrazone bond was cleaved after rather brief preincubation of the immunoliposomes at pH 5 for 0.5 to 1 h. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis of cancer cells (HeLa and MCF-7) treated with cancer cell-specific targeting ligand mAb 2C5-bearing liposomes showed enhanced cellular binding. Studies at low pH clearly confirmed the easy cleavability of the targeting ligand from the liposomes resulting in significantly less or virtually no cellular association."

A diagnosis of diffuse large cell, B-cell type malignant lymphoma, associated with hemophagocytic syndrome (LAHS), was made. CT scan revealed lymphadenopathy in the abdominal cavity and multiple tumors in the spleen. Performance status and hepatic coma grade were 4 and II, respectively. Laboratory findings showed bicytopenia (Hb 9.9 g/dl, platelet 35 x 10(3)/microliter), severe liver dysfunction (ALP 1,115 U/l, gamma-GTP 437 U/l, T.Bil 15.4 mg/dl, D.Bil 12.8 mg/dl) and elevated levels of beta 2 microglobulin (12.9 mg/dl), ferritin (2,300 ng/ml) and sIL-2 receptor (36,900 U/ml). Plasma exchange (PE) and continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) enabled the patient to undergo diagnostic procedures, irradiation (total 34 Gy) and chemotherapy. Biopsy specimens revealed infiltration of lymphoma cells into the liver and bone marrow. We measured the blood concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 before and after PE and CHDF by the ELISA method, and found normalization of hypercytokinemia after the procedure. It was suggested that initial treatment with PE and CHDF was effective for control of HPS, enabling us to perform chemotherapy for the lymphoma."

C-PE (25 and 50 mg/kg body weight per d) was administered to experimental streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced type 2 diabetic male rats for 28 d. C-PE treatment successfully ameliorated diabetic complications by decreasing food intake, organ weights, serum concentrations of glucose, cholesterol, TAG, VLDL-cholesterol, creatinine, uric acid and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), with increases in body weight, Hb, total protein, bilirubin and ferric-reducing ability of plasma values. Hepatic and renal tissues demonstrated significant decreases in TBARS, lipid hydroperoxide and conjugated diene contents, with increases in superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione, vitamin E and vitamin C levels. Furthermore, the 4-week ex vivo and in vitro administration of C-PE (0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml) indicated a decrease in Cu-mediated serum oxidation. The kinetics of the LDL oxidation profile showed significant prolongation of the lag phase with declines in oxidation rate, conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxide and TBARS. Results indicated the involvement of C-PE in the amelioration of diabetic complications by significant reductions in oxidative stress and oxidised LDL-triggered atherogenesis."
CD010864,0,18595202,0,"Serum surfactant protein-A, but not surfactant protein-D or KL-6, can predict preclinical lung damage induced by smoking.","Serum surfactant protein (SP)-A offers a useful clinical marker for interstitial lung disease (ILD). However, SP-A is occasionally elevated in non-ILD pulmonary patients. The present study was conducted to investigate factors that affect serum SP- A levels in respiratory medicine. Serum SP-A, serum SP-D, serum Klebs von den Lungen (KL)-6 and pulmonary function tests were evaluated in 929 patients (current smokers, n=255; ex-smokers, n=242; never-smokers, n=432) without ILD or pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Serum SP-A was significantly higher in current smokers than in never- or ex-smokers (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). Serum SP- A was significantly higher in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary thromboembolism than in other diseases (p<0.01). Serum SP-A correlated positively with amount of smoking (p<0.01) and negatively with forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (p<0.05). Serum SP-D and KL-6 were unaffected by smoking. Smoking should be taken into account when evaluating serum SP-A levels, and different baseline levels of serum SP-A should be established for smokers and non-smokers. Serum SP-A may also represent a useful marker for predicting COPD in the preclinical stage."
CD010864,0,11584189,0,Prognosis in pulmonary embolism.,"Acute pulmonary embolism has a wide prognostic spectrum, ranging from sudden death within minutes of a thromboembolic episode to a benign treatable condition associated with a stable clinical course and no long-term sequelae. In patients who survive an initial thromboembolic episode and receive antithrombotic therapy, the clinical course can be complicated by recurrent nonfatal venous thromboembolism, fatal pulmonary embolism, the postthrombotic syndrome, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Identifying which patients are at increased risk of experiencing these sequelae is important in decision making relating to the aggressiveness of initial antithrombotic therapy, the duration of antithrombotic therapy, and the frequency of clinical surveillance. In addition, this information may be helpful to clinicians in discussing disease prognosis with patients. The objectives of this review are to provide reasonable estimates of the risks of recurrent nonfatal venous thromboembolism, fatal pulmonary embolism, the postthrombotic syndrome, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in patients with treated pulmonary embolism, and to identify risk factors for these sequelae."

CD010864,0,16814320,0,Cardiac inflammation contributes to right ventricular dysfunction following experimental pulmonary embolism in rats.,"Acute right ventricular (RV) failure following pulmonary embolism (PE) is a strong predictor of poor clinical outcome. Present studies test for an association between RV failure from experimental PE, inflammation, and upregulated chemokine expression. Additional experiments test if neutrophil influx contributes to RV dysfunction. PE was induced in male rats by infusing 24 microm microspheres (right jugular vein) producing mild hypertension (1.3 million beads/100 g, PE1.3), or moderately severe hypertension (2.0 million beads/100 g, PE2.0). Additional rats served as vehicle sham (0.01% Tween 20, Veh). In vivo RV peak systolic pressures (RVPSP) increased significantly, and then declined following PE2.0 (51 +/- 1 mm Hg 2 h; 49 +/- 1, 6 h; 44 +/- 1, 18 h). RV generated pressure of isolated, perfused hearts was significantly reduced in PE2.0 compared with PE1.3 or Veh. MCP-1 protein (ELISA) was elevated 21-fold and myeloperoxidase activity 95-fold in RV of PE2.0 compared with Veh or PE1.3. CINC-1, CINC-2, MIP-2, MCP-1, and MIP-1alpha mRNA also increased in RV of PE2.0. Histological analysis revealed massive accumulation of neutrophils (selective esterase stain) and monocyte/macrophages (CD68, ED-1) in RV of PE2.0 hearts in regions of myocyte damage. Electron microscopy showed myocyte necrosis and phagocytosis by inflammatory cells. LV function was normal and did not show increased inflammation after PE2.0. Treatment with anti-PMN antibody reduced RV MPO activity and prevented RV dysfunction. Conclusions-PE with moderately severe pulmonary hypertension (PE2.0) resulted in selective RV dysfunction, which was associated with increased chemokine expression, and infiltration of both neutrophils and monocyte/macrophages, indicating that a robust immune response occurred with RV damage following experimental PE. Experimental agranulocytosis reduced RV, suggesting that neutrophil influx contributed to RV damage."
CD010864,0,15199497,0,Pulmonary embolism: from clinical presentation to clinical probability assessment.,"The rehabilitation of clinical assessment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is certainly one of the major breakthroughs of the last decade in the field of pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis. Although the value of isolated clinical findings in suspected PE is limited due to the poor sensitivity and specificity of its symptoms and signs, their combination, whether empiric or explicit through prediction rules, allows a fairly accurate assessment of the likelihood of the disease in a given patient. This allows the identification of a large subset of patients with a low prevalence of the disease in whom a combination of noninvasive tests rules out PE effectively despite these tests' limited individual sensitivity. The best validated example is the combination of a low probability lung scan and a normal venous compression ultrasound in a patient with low clinical probability of PE, which is associated to a low 1 to 2% 3-month risk of VTE in such patients left untreated by anticoagulants. Finally, clinical assessment contributes significantly to the cost savings associated with modern noninvasive strategies."
CD010864,0,6356456,0,Measurement of crosslinked fibrin degradation products - an immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies.,"We have prepared a monoclonal antibody which recognises an antigenic determinant on D dimer, a specific fragment resulting from the degradation of crosslinked fibrin. This antibody has been used in the development of an enzyme-linked immunoassay for D dimer and related degradation products containing crosslinked gamma-gamma chains, to provide a simple assay of circulating crosslinked fibrin degradation products suitable for clinical use. Since these crosslinked fibrin degradation products are characteristic of fibrinolysis, as distinct from fibrinogenolysis, their measurement should aid in the diagnosis, evaluation and monitoring of thrombotic and thrombolytic states. In preliminary studies, low concentrations of crosslinked fibrin derivatives were detected in normal sera. High levels were found in 30/30 patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation and in the majority of patients having deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,3363526,0,Determination of human thrombin-antithrombin III complex in plasma with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the determination of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) in human plasma. The test system follows the sandwich principle and uses two different antibodies directed against human thrombin and human antithrombin III, respectively. The antibodies bind selectively to the corresponding antigen moieties of TAT. The assay was calibrated with definite concentrations of preformed purified TAT added to TAT-poor plasma. The lower limit of sensitivity of the assay was 0.5 microgram/l. Mean coefficients of variation of 4.2% (intraassay) and 3.5% (interassay) were found for TAT concentrations between 2 and 60 micrograms/l. A reference range from 0.85 to 3.2 micrograms/l was calculated from TAT concentration in plasma samples from 88 healthy donors (mean value +/- SD: 1.45 +/- 0.4 micrograms/l). In plasma samples from patients with pulmonary embolism (n = 17), TAT concentrations between 3 and 25 micrograms/l were measured. In 15 patients with deep vein thrombosis, TAT was found up to 3 to 25 micrograms/l. From these data we conclude that measurement of TAT can be a sensitive parameter for specific detection of a latent activation of the clotting pathway."

CD010864,0,20157841,0,Incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism and of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in patients after a first episode of pulmonary embolism.,"After a first episode of pulmonary embolism (PE), two major problems need to be considered: risk of recurrence when anticoagulation is stopped, and risk of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTPH). We followed prospectively consecutive patients who survived a first episode of PE, with or without deep vein thrombosis, to assess the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrences and of symptomatic and asymptomatic CTPH. After 3-6 months of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography for measuring transtricuspid (rV-rA) gradient. When rV-rA gradient was >35 mmHg further evaluations were performed to rule in or out CTPH. During follow-up patients who developed persistent dyspnea were re-evaluated. In patients who underwent OAT withdrawal D-dimer (DD), prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2), and thrombophilia were evaluated one month after warfarin discontinuation. Overall, 239 patients, 118 males, median age 59(16-89) years, were followed up for a median time of 36(9-192) months. Nine patients had rV-rA gradient >30 mmHg and â¤35 mmHg, and one of 37 mmHg. Among patients with normal rV-rA gradient, one developed persistent dyspnea 55 months after the first event and CPTH was confirmed. Among 206 patients who stopped OAT, 23(11.2%) had VTE recurrence, 11 PE(48%). Elevated DD and F1 + 2 levels after stopping OAT were significantly associated with recurrence. None of patients with recurrent VTE had elevated rV-rA gradient. In our series the incidence of CTPH after a first episode of PE was 0.4%. VTE recurrence and elevated DD and F1 + 2 levels seemed not to be related to the development of CTPH."

Sudden death accounts for approximately 2/3 of autopsies in forensic medicine, which is why the accurate diagnosis of IHD and first of all acute myocardial ischaemia is so important. On certain occasions in forensic medical practice it is difficult to diagnose AMI from morphological observation alone. In such cases, complementary diagnostic techniques, such as the determination of biochemical markers of the necrosis of the heart muscle (myoglobin, troponin I and creatine kinase) in cadaver fluids, take on special importance, so we decided to test the diagnostic evaluation of postmortem cTnl, myoglobin and creatine kinase determination in serum and pericardial fluid. Recently, cardiac troponins have gained attention as very specific markers of myocardial cell injury, and the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology have suggested that these proteins should be preferred markers for the diagnosis of the necrosis of heart muscle."

Clinical exclusion of patients from further imaging is recommended if the patient has a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism and a normal d-dimer. It is advised that all remaining patients undergo bilateral leg Doppler assessment. If this test is positive, the patient should be treated for pulmonary embolism; if negative, all patients should be referred for CT pulmonary angiography.

CD010864,0,18636747,0,Interacting targets of the farnesyl of transducin gamma-subunit.,"G protein gamma-subunits are isoprenylated and carboxyl methylated at the C-terminal cysteine residue, and the set of the posttranslational modifications is indispensable for the function of the photoreceptor G protein transducin (Talpha/Tbetagamma). To explore farnesyl-mediated molecular interactions, we investigated molecular targets of a Tbetagamma analogue that was engineered to have a photoreactive farnesyl analogue, (3-azidophenoxy)geranyl (POG), covalently bound to the C-terminal cysteine of Tgamma. POG-modified Tbetagamma was further subjected to modification by methylation at the C-terminal carboxyl group, which copies a complete set of the known posttranscriptional modifications of Tbetagamma. Photoaffinity labeling experiment with the photoreactive Tbetagamma analogue in its free form indicated that the POG moiety of Tgamma interacted with Tbeta. In the trimeric Talpha/Tbetagamma complex, the POG moiety was cross-linked with Talpha in addition to concurrent affinity labeling of Tbeta. When photoreactive Tbetagamma was reconstituted with Talpha and light-activated rhodopsin (Rh*) in rod outer segment (ROS) membranes, the POG moiety interacted with not only Talpha and Tbeta but also Rh* and membrane phospholipids. The cross-linked phospholipid species was analyzed by ELISA employing a variety of lipid-binding probes, which revealed phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) as selective phospholipids for POG interaction in the ROS membranes. These results demonstrate that the modifying group of Tgamma plays an active role in protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions and suggest that the farnesyl-PE/PS interaction may support the efficient formation of the signaling ternary complex between transducin and Rh*."

The clinical presentation is more variable than sudden dyspnea and chest pain, especially in the critical care patient. Recognition of venous thromboembolic (VTE) risk factors can help develop a good clinical suspicion for PE. A wide range of diagnostic tests are available to the clinician. The ventilation/perfusion scan, pulmonary arteriogram, and lower extremity investigations are still important for diagnosis. Other noninvasive tests such as spiral CT with venography, echocardiography, and D-dimers are becoming more accepted. Heparin is the mainstay of PE therapy, but thrombolytic treatment may be lifesaving in the unstable patient. VTE prophylaxis should be considered in all post-operative or critical care patients."

CD010864,0,8697333,0,Effects of bezafibrate on erythrocyte membrane phospholipids in alcohol-treated rats.,"Male rats of the Wistar strain were divided 4 groups, and give a liquid diet of control feed, bezafibrate (150 mg/kg), ethanol, and ethanol plus bezafibrate for 5 week. The effect of bezafibrate supplementation on rats fed ethanol was examined in terms of the fatty acid composition of the phospholipids in the erythrocyte membrane. In the phospholipids profiles of erythrocyte membranes, PI was significantly decreased. The decrease in PI caused by bezafibrate appeared to substantially affect the membrane and consequently lead to changes in the membrane anchor. In the fatty acid composition of the PC, C20: 4 was significantly decreased in the group receiving alcohol (p < 0.05) but increased in the groups receiving bezafibrate (p < 0.05). In the fatty acid composition of the PE, C16: 0 was significantly increased in the three groups when compared with the control, and C20: 4 was decreased in the alcohol group (p < 0.05). In the fatty acid of SM and PI, C20: 4 was decreased and C18: 0 increased in the alcohol group. In the PS, C14: 0 was increased in the alcohol group, and decreased in the alcohol plus bezafibrate group (p < 0.01). The levels of arachidonic acid in the total fatty acids that constituted the membrane phospholipids were decreased in the rats given ethanol (p < 0.05). However, arachidonic acid in the group of bezafibrate supplementation on rats fed ethanol were elevated in comparison with the alcohol group (p < 0.05). With decreasing arachidonic acid as a marker of alcohol tissue injury following chronic alcohol intake, the effects of bezafibrate supplementation appear to contribute to membrane fluidity by altering the biochemical flexibility of the membrane."
CD010864,0,11499792,0,Exclusion of pulmonary embolism using quantitative plasma D-dimer assays.,"Recent quantitative studies using pulmonary angiography as reference method have indicated that the overall accuracy of quantitative D-dimer assays for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients suspected of PE is poorer than was reported in earlier studies in which the same D-dimer assays were used (90-94% vs 98-100%). An explanation can be found in the fact that the earlier studies are hampered by the fact that the reference method was a compilation of clinical data and non-invasive diagnostic tests rather than a true gold standard. Furthermore, in those studies no discrimination was made between the milder cases of subsegmental PE and the more severe cases of segmental and larger PE. The lack of a true gold standard and preselection leading to reduced proportions of cases of subsegmental PE in the earlier studies rather than differences in the storage conditions of plasma samples or treatment with heparin, appear to have caused the discrepancies in the reported accuracy of D-dimer assays. It is concluded that the sensitivity and negative predictive values obtained with different quantitative D-dimer assays are in close agreement with each other, that is poor for subsegmental PE and excellent for segmental and larger PE. In diagnostic algorithms D-dimer can reliably exclude acute segmental and/or massive PE. Further work-up within 48 hours is still necessary in negative D-dimer outcomes to exclude subsegmental PE."

The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for pregnancy-related VT was 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.8) for women with factor VIII >90th percentile. The aOR for VT for endogenous thrombin potential and D-dimer values >90th percentiles were 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-3.0) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.3-3.3), respectively. Factor IX >90th percentile or free protein S â¤the 5th percentile increased the risk for PE, and the aORs were 2.4 (95% CI 1.1-5.0) and 3.1 (95% CI 1.3-7.2), respectively. Women carrying the factor V Leiden (F5 rs6025) polymorphism, or who had reduced sensitivity to activated protein C (aPC) in the absence of F5 rs6025, had increased risk for DVT, with unadjusted ORs 7.7 (95% CI 4.7-12.7) and 3.5 (95% CI 2.2-5.4), respectively. Women with a history of pregnancy-related VT showed activation of coagulation and had elevated factor VIII. Furthermore, high levels of factor IX and low levels of free protein S were associated with increased risk for PE, whereas aPC resistance and F5 rs6025 were risk factors for DVT and not PE."

Recent studies suggested that D-dimer may identify patients at low risk of recurrence after a first VTE [3,4]. In a pilot, prospective, cohort study we aimed to assess the negative predictive value of D-dimer in patients with recurrent VTE. Patients with negative D-dimer while on treatment stopped anti coagulation and underwent repeated testing after 7, 15, and 30 days; treatment was resumed if D-dimer turned positive and permanently stopped if it remained negative. The study was interrupted after the enrolment of 75 patients. At that time, treating physicians decided treatment resumption in 12.2% of the patients, but the majority of events were distal or superficial vein thromboses. The rate of objectively documented recurrent proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) was 2.56% (95% CI 0.13, 15.07%) in the 39 patients with persistently negative D-dimer at 30 days, for an annual incidence of VTE of 5.65 events/100 patient/years. These preliminary findings suggest that negative D-dimer may identify patients with history of previous VTE at low risk of recurrences, but this approach should be tested in larger trials in highly selected patients."

FDP/fdp values were elevated by the latex-agglutination kit when normal by the TRCHII for 79 (13%) samples, and the reverse was true for 20 (3%) samples. Serial dilution of serum sample allowed reliable semiquantitation of FDP/fdp levels compared with TRCHII results (r=less than .001). The latex-agglutination test gave FDP/fdp values of larger than or equal to 10 mug. per ml. for sera from 11 of 13 patients who had acute pulmonary embolism and for only one of 24 normal control samples.

Systemic thrombolytic therapy with urokinase for seven days resulted in nearly complete resolution of the thromboembolic material in the pulmonary arteries. Antithrombotic therapy with intravenous heparin and overlapping oral phenoprocoumon was continued on the regular ward. Six days later, the patient had to be readmitted to the ICU with evidence of hemodynamic compromise due to massive bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism that could be confirmed by CT scan--DVT had extended to the right iliacal vein. Additionally, peripheral thrombocyte counts had markedly declined from 112.000 to 35.000/microliter within 3 days, indicating the presence of a Hit type II. This was verified by positive ELISA testing for antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin-complex. A filter device was temporarily implanted into the inferior vena cava.

The character of the interactions depends on the monomer composition (r = [COOH]/[NIPAAm]), [Cu(2+)]/[PE], and [BSA]/[PE] ratios and solution pH. Two types of ternary polycomplex (polymer + Cu(2+) + BSA) particles are formed depending on the monomer composition r of the copolymer. At r from 1/3 to 1/1, the protein molecules in the structure of ternary polycomplex particles are densely covered by the shell of a polymer coil and practically ""fenced off"" from the water environment. At r > or = 3/1 ternary polycomplex PAA-Cu(2+)-BSA particles have more friable structures in which protein molecules are practically exposed to the solution. At low polymer concentration, an intrapolymer ternary polycomplex is formed. This complex aggregates to an interpolymer species upon increase in polymer concentration. Fluorescence data indicate that in ternary complex polymer interacts through Cu(2+) ions with BSA preferentially at the site close to the location of ""cleft"" tryptophan residue. This leads to static quenching of this tryptophan fluorescence. Cu(2+)-induced complex formation is an equilibrium reaction."

It is widely agreed that its most important clinical symptom is thrombocytopenia, with or without thromboembolism.Assuming, unlike other authors, that thrombosis is the leading clinical symptom of HIT type II, we investigated the frequency of an immunological reaction indicative of HIT type II in patients suffering from thrombosis. From January 1999 to December 2000, 77% ( n=6713) of our in-patients received heparin for more than 5 days as thrombosis prophylaxis. When thrombosis was suspected on the grounds of clinical appearances, the patient concerned underwent phlebography, and two different serological tests for anti-heparin antibodies were also carried out. In such cases, patients were immediately switched to hirudin instead of heparin. In 29 out of 101 patients, the clinical suspicion of thrombosis was confirmed. Three patients developed pulmonary embolism. In 4 patients both serological tests revealed the presence of anti-heparin antibodies. Three of the remaining 72 patients with negative phlebography results were found to have antibodies on serological testing. In none of the 7 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HIT type II was the classical sign of thrombocytopenia was present. Even with thorough clinical and phlebographic examinations, the incidence of HIT type II is only 0.13% in our institution. One of the 7 patients with thrombosis was not thrombocytopenic but did show the typical immunological reaction. Since the incidence of HIT type II is low and thrombocytopenia is not a reliable indicator for HIT II, the need for frequent thrombocyte counts (twice weekly) should be reconsidered.However,patients developing thrombosis while receiving heparin need to be treated for clinically suspected HIT type II until the final diagnosis is made."

The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment."
CD010864,0,10468141,0,Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"The patient with suspected pulmonary embolism presents a challenging diagnostic problem. The symptoms and signs are nonspecific, and objective testing is required to establish or exclude the presence of pulmonary embolism. Lung scanning continues to be a first-line test, but in 40% to 70% of all patients, the results do not definitively provide indication for either giving or withholding anticoagulant treatment even when combined with the clinical assessment. Pulmonary angiography is the reference standard, but it is invasive and may not be available in all clinical settings. Pulmonary embolism is strongly associated with proximal deep-vein thrombosis of the legs (popliteal, femoral, or iliac vein thrombosis). Objective testing for proximal deep-vein thrombosis is useful in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. A positive result from such testing provides an indication for anticoagulant treatment. Serial testing for proximal deep-vein thrombosis is a safe and effective alternative to pulmonary angiography in patients with adequate cardiorespiratory reserve. The assay for plasma D-dimer using either a rapid enzyme-linked immunospecific assay technique or a bedside whole-blood agglutination technique is promising as a test for excluding venous thromboembolism. A positive result by spiral CT imaging is useful for ruling in a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, but the safety of withholding treatment in patients with negative spiral CT results remains uncertain.

CD010864,0,21213203,0,Pleural effusion in pulmonary embolism.,"An estimated 300,000 to 500,000 patients develop a pleural effusion secondary to pulmonary embolism each year in the United States. The pleural effusions due to pulmonary embolism are usually small. They occupy less than one third of the hemithorax in 90% and are frequently manifest only as blunting of the costophrenic angle. The pleural fluid with pulmonary embolism is almost always an exudate. When pulmonary embolism is considered a diagnostic possibility, the clinical probability of pulmonary embolism should be assessed. If the probability is low, measurement of D-dimers is useful. If the D-dimer test is negative, the diagnosis is virtually excluded. If the D-dimer test is positive or if there is a high clinical probability of pulmonary embolism, the best test to assess the possibility of pulmonary embolism is probably the computed tomographic angiogram (CTA). Patients who have a high probability of pulmonary embolism should be anticoagulated while the definitive test is being performed. The presence of a pleural effusion does not alter the standard treatment for pulmonary embolism. The two complications of pleural effusions in patients with pulmonary embolism are hemothorax and pleural infection. If the pleural effusion increases in size while a patient is being treated for pulmonary embolism, a diagnostic thoracentesis should be performed to rule out these complications."

CD010864,0,2298741,0,Selective post-transcriptional down-regulation of protein kinase C isoenzymes in leukemic T cells chronically treated with phorbol ester.,"Binding to, and activation of, protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol ester (PE) tumor promoters may underlie their tumor-promoting activity. To study the effects of long-term PE treatment on regulation of cellular PKC, we adapted the human leukemic T cell line, Jurkat (JK), to continuous growth in the presence of PE. Such cells (JKPE) displayed loss of CD2 and CD3 cell surface molecules, known to play an important role in agonist-stimulated T cell activation, unresponsiveness to stimuli that induce interleukin 2 (IL2) receptor expression or IL2 production, change in the expression of several cell cycle-regulated genes, and a 6-fold reduction in cellular PKC enzymatic activity. This reduction was accompanied by the disappearance of a major approximately 82-kDa immunoreactive protein in JKPE cytosol when cell extracts were immunoblotted with a polyclonal anti-PKC peptide antibody cross-reactive with the PKC isoenzymes, alpha, beta, and gamma. Analysis with additional anti-peptide antibodies specific for alpha, beta, or gamma PKC indicated that all three types of PKC are expressed in JK cells; however, JKPE cells lost a major approximately 82 kDa immunoreactive cytosolic protein detectable with anti-PKC alpha antibody. In contrast, levels of expression and subcellular distribution of immunoreactive PKC beta and PKC gamma, as well as levels of mRNA specific for the three PKC isoenzymes, were not significantly affected by chronic PE treatment. These results indicate that PE-mediated reduction of PKC in JKPE cells is selective and occurs at the protein, not mRNA, level, and support the notion that distinct isoenzymes encoded by the PKC multigene family may be independently regulated. Moreover, the correlation between phenotypic and functional changes on one hand, and the selective reduction of PKC alpha on the other, raises the possibility that expression of CD2 and/or CD3 and functional activation in JKPE cells are preferentially regulated by PKC alpha."

Several histological parameters were assessed on a relative scale of 14. Primary TJRs were clinically evaluated for degree of osteoarthrosis. Revision TJRs were assessed for migration of the implant, gross loosening and the degree of radiolucency. Cytokine levels in synovial fluid were determined with ELISA. All cytokines were significantly higher in revision TJRs than in primary replacements, as were the degree of macrophage and giant cell infiltration. We found no relationship between any clinical variable and the levels of any cytokine, but migration of the implant was related to the presence of PE debris. A significant correlation was seen between the presence of macrophages and the levels of IL-1beta, IL-8 and IL-10, but not IL-6. No differences were noted between hips and knees for any of the variables, except in the levels of IL-6, where higher levels were found in THRs. These results suggest a unique role for IL-6 that requires further investigation."

Male Wistar strain rats, four weeks old, were fed diets containing a 3% (w/w) yeast RNA and a 5% (w/w) viscous DF for five days. Viscosity of DF samples used, in order of strength, were xanthan gum (XG) > guar gum (GG) > locust bean gum (LBG) > karaya gum (KG) > pectin (PE) = arabic gum (AG) > CM-cellulose (CMC) = inulin (IN). The serum uric acid concentration in the viscous DF groups significantly decreased as compared with that in the cellulose (CL) group. The urinary excretions of uric acid and allantoin in the respective groups given AG, GG, IN, KG, PE, and XG were significantly suppressed as compared with those in the CL group. The fecal RNA excretion was markedly increased in the IN, KG, PE, and XG groups in comparison to the CL group. The DF with high viscosity significantly suppressed RNA digestion by RNase A and decreased uptakes of 14C-labeled adenosine and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (5'-AMP) in rat jejunum. The results reveal that the suppressive effect of DF on elevation of serum uric acid concentration induced by dietary RNA in rats is associated with the strength of DF viscosity. The mechanism by which this is accomplished is suggested to be attributed to the inhibitions of digestion for dietary RNA and/or absorption of the hydrolyzed compounds."
CD010864,0,19786156,0,Office management of deep venous thrombosis in the elderly.,"Deep venous thrombosis is common in the elderly. Diagnosis and management are now a part of office practice. As signs and symptoms are inconsistent and nonspecific, diagnostic testing is necessary. For patients with a low clinical probability, a normal D-dimer result can rule out disease. For patients with a high clinical suspicion or an elevated D-dimer, duplex ultrasonography may confirm the diagnosis. Anticoagulation, usually with low-molecular-weight heparin, should begin on suspicion and continue, along with warfarin, until the international normalized ratio is therapeutic. Arrangements for the initial daily injections can be made with a visiting nurse. Treatment should continue for at least 3 months, when a risk-versus-benefit analysis for continuing anticoagulation should be undertaken. Therapy may be discontinued for thromboses associated with a reversible risk factor or for patients in whom anticoagulant management was unstable or complicated by bleeding. A persistently high D-dimer result or evidence of residual clot on repeat duplex ultrasonography may support continuation. For all patients, the use of compression stockings to prevent the post-thrombotic syndrome is recommended."
CD010864,0,20853135,0,"Pathophysiology, clinics and diagnostics of non-thrombotic pulmonary embolism.","Non-thrombotic pulmonary embolism (NTPE) is commonly defined as the partial or total occlusion of the pulmonary circulation caused by a variety of non-thrombotic embolic agents. Although its prevalence is much lower than that of pulmonary thromboembolism, this life-threatening pathology is often underestimated due to the low specificity of signs and symptoms and because it might be frequently overlooked in the differential diagnosis of the chest pain. The main sources of non-thrombotic pulmonary emboli include cancers, fat, infective agents, amniotic fluid, a variety of foreign materials and gases. The diagnosis is particularly challenging. The spectrum of imaging findings using imaging techniques such as computed tomography is unpredictable and typically heterogeneous, whereas laboratory tests can only be helpful for establishing the cause but not the presence of the disease (i.e., D-dimer testing is frequently negative). As such, the clinical history along with the identification a potential underlying disease are the often the mainstay for the differential diagnosis. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the pathophysiology, clinics and diagnostic approach to NTPE."

CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), nuclear lung scan (V/Q scan), D-dimer test and modern echocardiography have revolutionized the diagnostic methodology and risk assessment criteria. Cardiogenic shock or systolic hypotension (BP < 90 mmHg) and presence of right ventricular dysfunction (or failure) are two principal criteria which govern the severity of pulmonary embolism. While all patients of pulmonary embolism require anticoagulation, systemic thrombolytic therapy is the mainstay of initial treatment in massive and submassive pulmonary embolism. When thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed, urgent surgical embolectomy or catheter embolectomy may be life saving procedures in severe pulmonary embolism."

Ultrasonography and venography results yielded a diagnosis of left femoral vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism was diagnosed later. Intravenous heparin therapy (10,000 IU/day) improved the patient's clinical signs. During this therapy, however, pain and edema of the right lower extremity developed, leading to a diagnosis of right femoral vein thrombosis. The patient was admitted to our hospital. At that time, coagulation studies showed an FDP level of 44.7 micrograms/ml and an FDP-DD level of 24.5 micrograms/ml. We surmised that the bilateral deep vein thrombosis had been caused by hyperhomocysteinemia (17.8 mumol/l). Genetic and other acquired risk factors for thrombophilia were ruled out. The patient's clinical signs again improved as a result of intravenous heparin therapy (15,000 IU/day), and FDP and FDP-DD levels returned to normal. We concluded that hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for thrombosis and that it can generate thrombosis in other locations even during heparin therapy."

CD010864,0,15248438,0,[Negative D-dimers and peripheral pulmonary embolism].,"The measurement of D-dimers is a recent addition to the diagnostic strategy of pulmonary embolism and has been shown to be a valuable tool with excellent sensitivity. However, there have been rare reports of patients with pulmonary embolism but negative D-dimer tests. The object of this study was to study patients with pulmonary embolism but negative D-dimers and to compare them with a population of patients with pulmonary embolism and raised D-dimers. One hundred and fifty consecutive patients admitted for pulmonary embolism were included in this study. All underwent measurement of D-dimers (normal <500 ng/ml) by an ELISA technique. The data of clinical examination and complementary investigations were analysed with respect to the D-dimers result. The sensitivity of raised D-dimers for pulmonary embolism was 96% (6 patients had results <500 ng/ml). The finding of chest pain was statistically greater in the group with negative D-dimers (p=0.01). In these cases, the emboli were all distal (p=0.0003), the average Miller index was significantly lower than in patients with high D-dimers (p=0.04) and the diagnostic value of ultrasound investigations (echocardiography, ultrasonography of lower limb veins) was less (p<0.0001). The authors conclude that measurement of D-dimers by the ELISA method may be non-diagnostic in distal pulmonary embolism and one explanation could be the less extensive thromboembolic process. In cases with negative D-dimers, a strong clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism should lead to the request for further investigations."

In a prospective series of 204 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism the association of D-dimer measurement and clinical probability was assessed for the exclusion of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The D-DI Liatest is a new generation, unitary, rapid and quantitative latex test with a comparative diagnostic performance to that of the reference ELISA test, and well adapted to emergency situations.The clinical probability was assessed by a quantitative score based on past history, clinical symptoms and signs. The positive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made by spiral CT scanner and/or pulmonary angiography, associated with Duplex ultrasonography of the leg veins in nondiagnostic results. The prevalence of pulmonary embolism was 42.6% and the absence of anticoagulation in patients considered not to have pulmonary embolism was associated with a thrombo-embolic incidence of 0.9% at 3 months. Fifty-six patients had D-dimer concentrations equal or inferior to the threshold of 500 microg/L; the sensitivity was 99% and the specificity 47% with a negative predictive value of 98% to 100% in cases with a low clinical probability.

Low-dose heparin was given in 5000 U subcutaneously two hours preoperatively and every 12 hours for seven days postoperatively. Low-dose heparin-treated patients had a significantly increased daily retroperitoneal hemovac drainage. Although not statistically significant, low-dose heparin was associated with increased estimated intraoperative blood loss, transfusion requirements, and wound hematomas. Fifteen percent of patients receiving low-dose heparin were found to have an activated partial thromboplastin time greater than 1.5 times the control value. In these patients, all clinical bleeding parameters were significantly increased. Low-dose heparin-treated patients also had significantly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and lower final platelet counts as compared with the control patients. When using low-dose heparin for thromboembolism prophylaxis, patients should be closely observed for clinical hemorrhagic complications. Activated partial thromboplastin times and platelet counts should be monitored throughout therapy."

CD010864,0,1000926,0,The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Objective documentation of pulmonary embolism is an essential prerequisite for appropriate treatment (Figure 7). A chest film, as well as measurement of arterial blood gases, should be obtained immediately, and if the lung fields are essentially normal, a lung scan should then be performed. If the scan shows a definite perfusion defect characteristic of embolism, this provides sufficient evidence to establish a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The presence of hypoxemia with a low arterial pO2, further confirms the suspicion of a ventilation-perfusion abnormality, and anticoagulant therapy with heparin should be initiated immediately. Should the chest film show abnormalities in the same anatomic areas in which perfusion defects are present on the scan, further investigation by pulmonary arteriography is required to substantiate the diagnosis. The use of pulmonary angiography for documentation of pulmonary embolism is also indicated at the outset when certain specific disorders that confuse scan interpretation are also present-chronic obstructive lung disease, emphysema, asthma, congestive cardiac failure. Assessment of the arterial blood oxygenation simultaneously with the estimated occlusion and the hemodynamic data can be used as a prognostic index as therapy progresses."

Rapid and accurate risk stratification is therefore of paramount importance to ensure the highest quality of care. This article critically reviews currently available and emerging tools for risk-stratifying acute PE, and particularly for distinguishing between elevated (intermediate) and low risk among normotensive patients. We focus on the potential value of risk assessment strategies for optimizing severity-adjusted management. Apart from reviewing the current evidence on advanced early therapy of acute PE (thrombolysis, surgery, catheter interventions, vena cava filters), we discuss recent advances in oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists, and with new direct inhibitors of factor Xa and thrombin, which may contribute to profound changes in the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolism in the near future."

CD010864,0,11140801,0,Assessment of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism by the combined use of clinical model and noninvasive diagnostic tests.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are relatively common diseases and are amenable to therapy but with a potentially fatal outcome if untreated. The diagnosis can be made in most patients with use of the noninvasive imaging tests, but limitations exist. The standard first choice of investigation in patients with suspected DVT is compression ultrasonography (CUS). As with all tests, there is a potential for false-positive and false-negative results. The latter are especially an issue for calf vein thrombi, and this in part has led to the concept of serial CUS testing of the proximal venous system and not imaging of the calf. The premise of the repeat (serial) CUS test is that only thrombi that extend to the proximal system are clinically relevant, and these thrombi will be detected during subsequent testing. However, despite the safety of the serial CUS testing concept, it is inconvenient and expensive. The standard first choice of investigation in patients with suspected PE, the ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) lung scan is nondiagnostic in most cases. In the past few years, the diagnostic process has improved because of the validation of clinical models that accurately categorize patients as having low (5%), moderate (20% to 30%), or high probability (>60%) for venous thromboembolic disease. Among the improvements this provides is the elimination of serial CUS testing if the ultrasound results are normal and the clinical probability is low in patients with suspected DVT. In patients with suspected PE in whom further testing is necessary, determination of clinical probability allows selection of invasive (angiography) or noninvasive testing (serial ultrasound) in patients with non-high-probability V/Q scans. The fibrin degradation product D-dimer has had a high negative predictive value; negative results with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests effectively rule out DVT or PE. In addition, a negative result with less-sentive D-dimer testing and a low clinical probability excludes DVT or PE."
CD010864,0,11140800,0,Use of D-dimer assays in the diagnosis of venous thrombosis.,"In the course of fibrin formation, the D-domains of adjacent fibrin molecules within the fibrin polymer are covalently linked by factor XIIIa, leading to the formation of a D-domain dimer. Proteolysis of this cross-linked fibrin generates fibrin fragments D-dimer and E as terminal products. Fragment D-dimer therefore is an indicator for the proteolysis of cross-linked fibrin, whereas the monomeric fragment D can stem from fibrinogen and non-cross-linked fibrin. Various monoclonal antibodies have been prepared that distinguish between fragments D-dimer and D and allow the detection of fibrin derivatives in the presence of fibrinogen. These anti-D-dimer-antibodies have been shown to react with fragment D-dimer, but also detect dimeric D-domains within larger fibrin compounds, including cross-linked fibrin complexes generated in an early phase of coagulation activation. Assay systems for D-dimer antigen therefore may uncover intravascular clot formation early, by detection of fibrin complexes, and after completion of clot formation, by the detection of proteolytic fragments released from the particulate clot. Various trials have shown that low concentrations of D-dimer antigen in the blood exclude recent venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Elevated levels may be caused by venous thrombotic disease, but also by a variety of other conditions, leading to intra- or extravascular fibrin formation. Assay systems include manual immunoagglutination assays, immunofiltration assays, microtiter plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems, automated ELISA systems, and latex-enhanced photometric immunoassays. According to clinical studies, D-dimer assays may be the ""first line"" of technical screening in symptomatic outpatients with suspected venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, but further prospective management trials, and improved standardization of assay systems, are needed for the validation of this approach."

We examined whether MMP-9 genetic polymorphisms (g.-1562C >T and g.-90(CA)13-25) modify plasma MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 levels and the responses to antihypertensive therapy in 214 patients with preeclampsia (PE), 185 patients with gestational hypertension (GH) and a control group of 214 healthy pregnant (HP). Alleles for the g.-90(CA)13-25 polymorphism were grouped L (low) (< 21 CA repeats) or H (high) (â¥ 21 CA repeats). Plasma MMP-9 and TIMP-1 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma MMP-9 concentrations were not affected by genotypes or haplotypes in HP and PE groups, except for the g.-90(CA)13-25 polymorphism: GH patients with the LH genotype for this polymorphism have higher MMP-9 levels than those with other genotypes. The T allele for the g.-1562C > T polymorphism and the H4 haplotype (combining T and H alleles) are associated with GH and lack of responsiveness to antihypertensive therapy in GH. The H2 haplotype (combining C and H alleles) was associated with lack of responsiveness to antihypertensive therapy in PE, but not in GH. In conclusion, our results show that MMP-9 genetic variants are associated with GH and suggest that MMP-9 haplotypes affect the responsiveness to antihypertensive therapy in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy."

To answer this question, a retrospective review was performed on all emergency department (ED) patients who underwent d-dimer assay and/or CTA from August 15, 2008, to August 14, 2009. The authors' algorithm for diagnosing PE requires that patients with low or intermediate probability of acute PE undergo a d-dimer assay, followed by CTA if the d-dimer is positive. Patients with high probability of PE should have CTA performed without a d-dimer assay. This result suggests that d-dimer assay and CTA are used inappropriately to evaluate patients with suspected acute PE in our ED. The low threshold for initiating an evaluation for PE decreases the prevalence of PE in this population."

We compared two assays for the measurement of D-dimer levels, the whole-blood immunoassay SimpliRED which can be performed in two minutes, and the plasma immunoassay NycoCard. D-dimer levels were determined with these two techniques in 100 patients. With clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis and positive D-dimer levels a compression ultrasonography using a colour coded Duplex instrument, or a phlebography were done. For clinically suspected pulmonary embolism a ventilation/perfusion scan was done in patients with normal x-ray. Patients with radiographic abnormalities were investigated with spiral computed tomography or pulmonary arteriography. When both assays showed negative results a diagnostic procedure was only done if there was a high clinical suspicion for thromboembolism. Both assays showed a correct positive result in seven of the eight diagnosed thromboembolic events and one false negative result each. The SimpliRED assay exhibited a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 61%, the negative predictive value was 98.3%, positive predictive value 15.9%. The NycoCard assay displayed also a sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity was lower with 39.6%, the negative predictive value was 97.4%, positive predictive value 10.7%. The SimpliRED assay can be a valuable tool when laboratory facilities for a plasma immunoassay are not accessible. The negative predictive value is very high, therefore this test is considered to be helpful for excluding a thromboembolic event."

Patients in whom DVT/PE was highly suspected were diagnosed by high-resolution multi-detector row computed tomography scanning (MDCT). Forty-nine knees in 46 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, 24 knees) or osteoarthritis (OA, 25 knees) were finally recruited. DVT/PE was detected in 28 (57.1%) of the 49 cases examined by diagnostic MDCT: 12 (50.0%) of the 24 cases of RA, and 16 (64.0%) of the 25 cases of OA. Of these, PE was found in 11 cases (39.2%), but none of them showed clinical symptomatic signs of dyspnea or chest pain. In both RA and OA cases, there were statistically significant differences in the D: -dimer value on postoperative day 3 (P = 0.027) and after day 28 (P = 0.037) between the groups with and without DVT/PE.

At the baseline, perioperative D: -dimer levels in the RA group without DVT/PE were higher than in the OA group. However, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that RA was not a significant risk factor of DVT/PE in comparison with OA.

In a porcine model the specific IgG antibody response to tetanus toxoid and type 6B pneumococcal polysaccharide was studied in 10 animals with splenectomy, 11 animals with splenic resection, 10 animals with splenic autotransplantation and 10 sham operated control animals. The operative groups were divided in two subgroups, receiving either the immuno adjuvant MTP-PE or the vehicle alone. Specific antibodies were determined by ELISA. Immunization with tetanus toxoid led to slightly lower peak IgG levels in splenectomized animals, but this was statistically not significant as compared to controls. In addition, the distribution of responders (78%) was not influenced by type of operation. Type 6B-pneumococcal polysaccharide proved to be a weak immunogen (19% responders). Splenectomy or spleen preserving surgery had no impact on the proportion of responders and peak IgG antibody titers of responders to this antigen. Additional administration of MTP-PE did not significantly increase the proportion of responders and had no impact on peak IgG antibody levels to tetanus toxoid and type 6B pneumococcal polysaccharide. These results show in contrast to previous studies in man, that under controlled conditions in the porcine model serum antibody responses to T-cell dependent and T-cell independent antigens are only slightly decreased by splenectomy. In addition, no effects of spleen preserving operations on antibody response are observed, and there is no change after concomitant administration of a muramyl peptide."

We retrospectively evaluated outcome in 1,273 stable patients with PE who had echocardiographic evaluations of RV size and/or measurement of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). In-hospital all-cause mortality was higher in those with RV enlargement (8.0%, 19 of 237, vs 3.3%, 22 of 663, p = 0.003). With an increased cTnI, irrespective of RV enlargement, all-cause mortality was 8.0% (28 of 330) versus 1.9% (15 of 835) in patients with a normal cTnI (p <0.0001). In patients with an increased cTnI combined with an enlarged right ventricle, all-cause mortality was 10.2% (12 of 118) compared to 1.9% (8 of 421) in patients who had neither (p <0.0001). These data show that increased levels of cTnI and RV enlargement are associated with an adverse outcome in stable patients with acute PE. In conclusion, increased levels of cTnI in combination with RV enlargement might indicate a group who would benefit from intense monitoring and aggressive treatment if subsequently indicated. The outcomes, however, were not extreme enough to warrant routine thrombolytic therapy."
CD010864,0,22795578,0,Placental CLIC3 is increased in fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia affected human pregnancies.,"Chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) proteins constitute a subgroup of the glutathione-S-transferase (GSTs) superfamily. In humans, the CLIC family of proteins consists of six members, designated CLIC 1-6, which have a conserved C-terminal 240 residue module and one major transmembrane domain. CLIC proteins regulate fundamental cellular processes including regulation of chloride ion concentration, stabilization of cell membrane potential, trans-epithelial transport, regulation of cell volume and stimulation of apoptotic processes in response to cellular stress. Previously, we described the expression profile of a member of the CLIC family of proteins, CLIC3, in human placentae and fetal membranes. In the current study, we determined CLIC3 expression in placentae from pregnancies complicated with either fetal growth restriction (FGR, n=19), pre-eclampsia (PE, n=16) or both FGR and PE combined (n=12) compared to gestation-matched controls (n=13) using real-time PCR and a CLIC3 specific immunoassay. Significantly increased CLIC3 mRNA and protein were detected in placental extracts from pregnancies with FGR, PE and PE with FGR compared to controls. Our results suggest that increased expression of CLIC3 may play a role in abnormal placental function associated with the human pregnancy disorders FGR and PE."
CD010864,0,9770000,0,[Does D-dimer determination allow the exclusion of pulmonary embolism?].,"The presence of D-dimers in the serum reflects fibrin formation and lysis. If the serum D-dimer level is lower than a threshold level which depends on the assay technique (usually 500 micrograms/l), pulmonary embolism can be excluded with a predictive value of 95%. This makes D-dimer assay an ideal screening tool for ambulatory patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Screening costs can be reduced in about one-third of the cases as other tests are not required. For routine practice, only ELISA tests have been validated for this indication, the sensitivity of latex tests being too low. D-dimer assay would be of little benefit for patients hospitalized for more than 24 for reasons other than suspected pulmonary embolism as specificity is very low in this population."

Currently there is no screening test for PE. We sought to identify differentially expressed plasma proteins in women who subsequently develop PE that may perform as predictive biomarkers. In seven DIGE experiments, we compared the plasma proteome at 20 wk gestation in women who later developed PE with an appropriate birth weight for gestational age baby (n=27) or a small for gestational age baby (n=12) to healthy controls with uncomplicated pregnancies (n=57). Of the 49 differentially expressed spots associated with PE-appropriate for gestational age, PE-small for gestational age or both (p<0.05, false discovery rate corrected), 39 were identified by LC-MS/MS. Two protein clusters that accurately (>90%) classified women at risk of developing PE were identified. Immunoblots confirmed the overexpression of fibrinogen gamma chain and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin in plasma prior to PE. The proteins identified are involved in lipid metabolism, coagulation, complement regulation, extracellular matrix remodeling, protease inhibitor activity and acute-phase responses, indicating novel synergism between pathways involved in the pathogenesis of PE. Our findings are remarkably similar to recently identified proteins complexed to high-density lipoprotein and linked to cardiovascular disease."

D-Dimer by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and latex and total FDP by ELISA were measured prospectively in 85 consecutive patients with suspected PE. With a cutoff of 500 ng/ml, D-dimer by ELISA presented a 96% sensitivity and a 42% specificity, with positive and negative predictive values of 49 and 96%, respectively. D-Dimer by latex, also with a cutoff of 500 ng/ml showed a 93% sensitivity and 29% specificity, with positive and negative predictive values of 43 and 89%. For total FDP, with a cutoff of 900 ng/ml, the sensitivity and specificity were 96 and 26% respectively, with positive and negative predictive values of 42 and 93%.

An intravenous alteplase bolus of 50 mg was administered, followed 40 min later by a 50 mg infusion over 2 h. Pulmonary arteriography showed a considerable increase in intraluminal filling of thrombotically occluded vessels as a result of alteplase administration, and was accompanied by marked clinical improvement. Peak alteplase plasma concentration after the bolus was 5.5 micrograms/ml, and the steady state concentration during infusion was 0.52 micrograms/ml. Detailed monitoring of haemostasis parameters showed elevated endogenous fibrinolytic activity at baseline, very high levels of fibrin degradation products during treatment resulting from lysis of an extensive thrombus mass, moderate fibrinogenolysis compared to fibrinolysis, long plasma half-lives of fibrin(ogen) degradation products (9.2-11.0 h), and increased thrombin generation.

We also examined whether circulating levels of galectin-1 and anti-galectin-1 autoantibodies are affected in PE. Seventy preeclamptic patients, 75 healthy pregnant and 21 healthy non-pregnant women were involved in this study. Serum galectin-1 and anti-galectin-1 autoantibody levels were measured by ELISA. Intracellular galectin-1 expression of lymphocytes was determined with flow cytometry. Serum galectin-1 and anti-galectin-1 IgG levels did not differ significantly between the healthy pregnant and the PE group. In healthy pregnant women, significantly higher percentage of T and NK cells expressed gal-1 in their cytoplasma than in healthy non-pregnant women. However, the proportion of galectin-1-expressing peripheral blood T and NK cells was markedly decreased in PE compared to normal pregnancy, which might contribute to the activation of innate and acquired immune cells."

It is believed to involve an inflammatory process. The aim of the study was to investigate and compare the concentrations of two proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) and to evaluate the possible interaction between them and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in women with normotensive pregnancy and PE.
CD010864,0,16136486,0,Increased immunohistochemical expression of thrombomodulin at placental perivascular myofibroblast in severe preeclampsia (PE).,"The presence of pro-coagulant and anti-coagulant components of the placental vascular endothelium and syncytiotrophoblast are essential for homeostasis. Vascular endothelium prevents blood clot formation in vivo by involving a cell surface thrombin-binding glycoprotein, thrombomodulin (TM), that activates plasma anti-coagulant protein C. The TM levels increase during pregnancy, but the fibrinolytic capacity diminishes. Since vascular lesions with placental coagulation disorders can be associated with preeclampsia (PE), we hypothesized that TM expression in the stem villous vasculature and syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta are impaired in PE. Plasma and placental tissue samples were collected from PE (n=12) and normotensive pregnant patients (n=11). Patient's gestational age was 35.7+/-1.2 (normotensive) and 30.6+/-1.5 weeks (PE). Blood samples were drawn 30 min before delivery. Serum PAI-1 and PAI-2 antigens were determined by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). A monoclonal antibody specific for TM was used for immunohistochemical tissue staining (ABC) and the staining was quantified by semi quantitative scores. Results show no intensity differences at the apical syncytiotrophoblast between the two groups. However, in preeclamptic placenta, TM expression diminished in the endothelium of the stem villi arteries and increased in the perivascular and stromal myofibroblats in cases of severe PE. TM changes were associated with an increased PAI-1/PAI-2 ratio. It is suggested that in severe PE, the decreased placental blood flow may be due to structural and functional impairment of the endothelium of the stem villi vessels and the surrounding perivascular and stromal myofibroblast, by increasing TM expression which may modulate fetal blow flow in the villous tree."
CD010864,0,20077824,0,[Clinical significance of physiological function testing in cardiovascular disease].,"Acute coronary syndrome most commonly begins with atherosclerotic plaque rupture and intracoronary thrombus formation. Therefore, the primary goal of treatment for acute coronary syndrome is the achievement of early and complete reperfusion. The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is made from typical symptoms, characteristic rises in serum enzyme levels, and changes in the electrocardiographic pattern. Although rapid developments in technology in the field of serum biomarkers have redefined the diagnosis of AMI, the electrocardiogram still remains significant in the diagnosis of AMI. Moreover, the identification of high-risk subgroups based on the admission electrocardiogram is essential to estimate the severity of AMI. Pulmonary embolism is an another thromboembolic disorder leading to mortality worldwide. The relationship between deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has been emphasized. The early detection of free-floating deep venous thrombosis by venous ultrasonography of the lower extremities is critical to prevent pulmonary embolism. For the detection of atherosclerosis, the identification of myocardial necrosis and thrombi by imaging tests is important.

CD010864,0,19273393,0,The association of D-dimer levels with clinical outcomes in patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism.,"The D-dimer fragment of fibrin degradation has been a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In conjunction with predictive algorithms, the high negative predictive value (NPV) of D-dimer measurements has provided this analyte with a prominent position in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). The purpose of this study was to determine if D-dimer levels correlate with ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) derangements as assessed by the alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (DeltaA-a) and to ascertain if quantitative measurements of D-dimer on admission have prognostic value in terms of during-admission mortality and recurrence over a 60-week period. The study utilized a retrospective cohort of 108 subjects admitted to a single institution and studied longitudinally. The cohort was divided into 4 groups representing degree of severity assessed by computed tomographic (CT) angiography: mild, moderate, severe, and very severe. Differences in D-dimer levels among these groups were strongly significant (P < .0001). A strong correlation was observed between D-dimer concentration and DeltaA-a (P < .0001). Logistic methods were used to calculate a ""cut-off"" level that would distinguish mild-moderate from severe-very severe PE. At a concentration of 12.35 mug/mL, this level yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 12.64 (P = .006) for during-admission mortality and a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.13 (P < .0001) for 60-week recurrence.

The prevalence of pulmonary embolism was 31%. The assay generated an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.79 (95% CI 0.73-0.84). A cut-off point of 0.05 microg/ml yielded a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and an exclusion efficiency of 100% (95% CI 96-100), 5% (95% CI 2-9), 100% (95% CI 69-100) and 3% (95% CI 2-6), respectively. A clinically useful cut-off point seems to be 0.11 microg/ml which corresponded with a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and an exclusion efficiency of 96% (95% CI 90-99), 27% (95% CI 24-28), 93% (95% CI 84-98) and 20% (95% CI 16-25), respectively. We conclude that the assay has potential clinical utility for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism, but it cannot be used as a sole test."

The three D-dimer methods compared were: (a) Accuclot D-dimer (b) IL-Test D-dimer (c) SimpliRED D-dimer. Of 993 patients, 141 had objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The sensitivity of SimpliRED, Accuclot and IL-Test were 79, 90 and 87% respectively. All three D-dimer tests gave similar negative predictive values. The SimpliRED D-dimer was found to be less sensitive than the Accuclot or IL-Test.

In order to determine the duodenal availability of porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) present in pancreatic extracts (PE) taken orally, we developed a method for quantifying PPL in samples containing both PPL and human pancreatic lipase (HPL). Total pancreatic lipase activity measurements using the pH-stat technique and tributyrin as substrate were combined with an HPL-specific ELISA. Based on the known specific activity of the purified HPL, its activity was deduced from the ELISA measurements, and the PPL activity was obtained by subtracting the HPL activity from the total pancreatic lipase activity. This assay was established and validated using various samples containing pure PPL and recombinant HPL or PE, mixed or not with human duodenal juice. Samples collected in vivo from patients treated with PE were also tested. It was found that PPL did not affect the HPL ELISA, and the indirect PPL assay gave a measurement accuracy of 6.6% with the samples containing pure PPL and 10% with those containing PE. This assay was also used successfully to discriminate between PPL and the endogenous HPL present in the duodenal contents of patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency treated with PE. This method might provide a useful means of assessing the availability of PEs at their site of action, in the absence of a PPL-specific ELISA."
CD010864,0,21296332,0,Meta-analysis of usefulness of d-dimer to diagnose acute aortic dissection.,"Numerous studies have examined whether plasma D-dimer (DD) can be used to identify patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD). These studies have been inconclusive because of their limited sample sizes and the different cut-off values employed. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the utility of plasma DD as a screening tool for AAD. We systematically searched EMBASE and MEDLINE and hand-searched relevant articles to identify studies investigating plasma DD as a screening tool for AAD. A value of 500 ng/ml was defined as the threshold for a positive plasma DD finding because it is widely used for ruling out pulmonary emboli. Using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects models we pooled data across studies to estimate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs). We identified 7 studies involving 298 subjects with AAD and 436 without. When data were pooled across studies, sensitivity (0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 0.99) and negative predictive value (0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.98) were high. Specificity (0.56, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.60) and positive predictive value (0.60, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.66) were low. Negative LR showed an excellent discriminative ability (0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.12), whereas positive LR did not (2.43, 95% CI 1.89 to 3.12). In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that plasma DD <500 ng/ml is a useful screening tool to identify patients who do not have AAD. Plasma DD may thus be used to identify subjects who are unlikely to benefit from further aortic imaging."

CD010864,0,19996068,0,Angiotensin receptor agonistic autoantibody is highly prevalent in preeclampsia: correlation with disease severity.,"Preeclampsia (PE), a syndrome affecting 5% of pregnancies, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The condition is often accompanied by the presence of a circulating maternal autoantibody, the angiotensin II type I receptor agonistic autoantibody (AT(1)-AA). However, the prevalence of AT(1)-AA in PE remains unknown, and the correlation of AT(1)-AA titers with the severity of the disease remains undetermined. We used a sensitive and high-throughput luciferase bioassay to detect AT(1)-AA levels in the serum of 30 normal, 37 preeclamptic (10 mild and 27 severe), and 23 gestational hypertensive individuals. Here we report that AT(1)-AA is highly prevalent in PE ( approximately 95%). Next, by comparing the levels of AT(1)-AA among women with mild and severe PE, we found that the titer of AT(1)-AA is proportional to the severity of the disease. Intriguingly, among severe preeclamptic patients, we discovered that the titer of AT(1)-AA is significantly correlated with the clinical features of PE: systolic blood pressure (r=0.56), proteinuria (r=0.70), and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 level (r=0.71), respectively. Notably, only AT(1)-AA, and not soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, levels are elevated in gestational hypertensive patients. These data serve as compelling clinical evidence that AT(1)-AA is highly prevalent in PE, and its titer is strongly correlated to the severity of the disease."

The principal aim of treatment of a venous thromboembolism with heparin and warfarin is to prevent extension or recurrence of clot. However, the recurrence rate following a deep vein thrombosis remains approximately 10% per annum following treatment cessation irrespective of the duration of anticoagulation therapy. Patients with raised D-dimer levels after discontinuing oral anticoagulation treatment have also been shown to be at high risk of recurrence.Post thrombotic syndrome is a complication of a deep vein thrombosis which can lead to chronic venous insufficiency and ulceration. It has a cumulative incidence after 2 years of around 25% and it has been suggested that extended oral anticoagulation should be investigated as a possible preventative measure."
CD010864,0,23010754,0,Pentraxin 3 as a new biomarker of peritoneal injury in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"It is well known that bioincompatible peritoneal dialysate plays a central role in the development of peritoneal fibrosis. Peritoneal inflammation continues even after the cessation of peritoneal dialysate stimulation. It is important to establish the definition of persistent inflammation in the peritoneal cavity at the cessation of peritoneal dialysis (PD). The objective of the present study was to determine whether pentraxin 3 (PTX3) in peritoneal effluent (PE) may be a new biomarker in PD patients. Serum, PE, and peritoneal specimens were obtained from 50 patients with end-stage kidney disease at Juntendo University Hospital. Samples of 19 patients were obtained at the initiation of PD and those of 31 patients at the cessation of PD. PTX3, high-sensitivity CRP, and MMP-2 and IL-6 were analyzed. An immunohistological examination using an anti-PTX3 antibody was performed. Expressions of PTX3 were observed in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and mesothelial cells in the peritoneum. The PTX3 level in PE at the cessation of PD was significantly higher than that at the initiation of PD. Effluent PTX3 levels in patients with a history of peritonitis or a PD duration of more than 8 years were significantly higher than those in patients without peritonitis or patients with a PD duration of <8 years. The PTX3 level was significantly correlated with MMP-2 and IL-6 levels in PE, as well as the thickness of the submesothelial compact zone and the vasculopathy.

In normal lymphocytes, IL-4R is mainly expressed on CD19+ cells, although it was also seen, at lower levels, on CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells. In RA patients, a significantly increased spontaneous expression of IL-4R was observed, compared with controls, in the CD3+, CD4+ and CD19+ cell subsets. No significant differences in IL-4R expression were found between patients receiving steroids and those who were not, suggesting that steroids are not involved in upregulating IL-4R levels in vivo. Because IL-4 is a potent upregulator of IL-4R, we considered the possibility that incremented levels of circulating IL-4 in RA accounted for the high surface expression of IL-4R. By ELISA, we found abnormally high levels of immunoreactive IL-4 in 35.13% of patient serum samples, while it was undetectable in control sera. In addition, we examined IL-4 mRNA expression by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the PBMC of patients and controls. IL-4 PCR products were observed in four out of 10 patients studied but in none of the controls. No correlation was observed between the seric concentrations of IL-4 and IL-4R, indicating that activator factors other than IL-4 contribute to the upregulation of IL-4R expression in RA. Since the patients' sedimentation rate and CRP values did not correlate with the concentration of circulating IL-4, we conclude that this lymphokine does not contribute to the deleterious effect of the disease. Rather, due to its antiinflammatory properties, the overproduction of IL-4 in RA may be a compensatory mechanism neutralizing the harmful effect of activated macrophages."

The study aimed at developing and evaluating a microsphere-based immunofluorescence assay (MIA) for the measurement of IgA, trying to fulfill the need of a quicker method using only small volumes of CSF. Microsphere beads were coated with goat-anti-dog IgA antibodies and bound IgA was detected by a mouse-anti-dog IgA antibody in combination with a PE-labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG. CSF from 44 dogs were tested for IgA and compared with an in-house utilized ELISA. Using clinical relevant reference ranges, the new method showed a good agreement (84.17%) with the ELISA. A method comparison revealed a moderate agreement only. These findings indicate that the MIA will not replace the ELISA, but it opens the possibility for further research with microsphere-based assays."

CD010864,0,15304025,0,Clinical criteria to prevent unnecessary diagnostic testing in emergency department patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"Overuse of the d-dimer to screen for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) can have negative consequences. This study derives and tests clinical criteria to justify not ordering a d-dimer. The test threshold was estimated at 1.8% using the method of Pauker and Kassirer. The PE rule-out criteria were derived from logistic regression analysis with stepwise backward elimination of 21 variables collected on 3148 emergency department patients evaluated for PE at 10 US hospitals. Eight variables were included in a block rule: Age < 50 years, pulse < 100 bpm, SaO(2) > 94%, no unilateral leg swelling, no hemoptysis, no recent trauma or surgery, no prior PE or DVT, no hormone use. The rule was then prospectively tested in a low-risk group (1427 patients from two hospitals initially tested for PE with a d-dimer) and a very low-risk group (convenience sample of 382 patients with chief complaint of dyspnea, PE not suspected). The prevalence of PE was 8% (95% confidence interval: 7-9%) in the low-risk group and 2% (1-4%) in the very low-risk group on longitudinal follow-up. Application of the rule in the low-risk and very low-risk populations yielded sensitivities of 96% and 100% and specificities of 27% and 15%, respectively. The prevalence of PE in those who met the rule criteria was 1.4% (0.5-3.0%) and 0% (0-6.2%), respectively. The derived eight-factor block rule reduced the pretest probability below the test threshold for d-dimer in two validation populations, but the rule's utility was limited by low specificity."
CD010864,0,19332967,0,Escherichia coli septic shock masquerading as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.,"Elevated cardiac biomarkers in conjunction with electrocardiographic (ECG) changes are valuable in diagnosing acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Elevated troponin I (TnI), while commonly seen in ACS, can also occur in entities such as sepsis and pulmonary thromboembolic disease. Raised TnI levels in patients with sepsis result from various mechanisms, including hypoperfusion or direct extension of infection to cardiac tissue, and can also serve as an important prognostic indicator. Electrocardiographic changes in sepsis are not as well described. Some of the ECG findings associated with septic shock include loss of QRS amplitude, increase in QTc interval, bundle branch blocks, and development of narrowed QRS intervals with deformed, positively deflected J waves (commonly known as Osborn waves). ST-segment elevations in sepsis are rare and have only previously been noted in a handful of case reports involving patients with septic shock.

CD010864,0,9429295,0,Altered immune response to staphylococcal antigens in long-lasting implanted mice.,"Staphylococcal infections constitute one of the main problems associated with clinical applications of various prosthetic medical devices (biomaterials). As the magnitude of the infection risk depends often on the duration of device installation, and the incidence of infections is higher in skin-penetrating devices, we studied some parameters of specific immune response to staphylococcal antigens in mice subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted for three months with heparinized polyethylene (H-PE). Three weeks before the evaluation of immune response, mice (implanted and non-implanted) were s.c. infected with 10(7) of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1. The proliferation of lymph node cells was determined on the basis of 3H-thymidine incorporation in 3-days cultures stimulated with: staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid (LTA), protein A (SpA), alpha-toxin, or with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Moreover, the levels of specific antibodies to staphylococcal antigens were determined in serum samples (ELISA against: LTA, SpA, alpha-toxin). The data obtained indicate that long-lasting implantation caused evident changes in proliferative activity of lymphocytes and humoral response to staphylococcal antigens. It enhances alpha-toxin and LTA stimulated proliferation of lymph node lymphocytes in vitro. In contrast, H-PE-implanted animals demonstrated a significant decrease in the production of anti-SpA IgG2a and IgG2b and increase in the synthesis of anti-LTA IgG1 antibodies."
CD010864,0,16168823,0,Role of biochemical markers in diagnosis of myocardial infarction.,"An ideal cardiac biochemical marker should have not only high sensitivity but also high specificity to myocardial infarction. The creatine kinase-MB, a relatively specific cardiac marker, could be elevated in situations other than acute myocardial infarction, such as renal failure, muscular injury, and myopathy. Although these are more specific than creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponins have also been reported to be elevated in conditions other than acute myocardial infarction, such as chronic renal failure, acute myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, rhabdomyolysis, sepsis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. With the ongoing research in this field, future holds hopes of finding an ideally specific marker of myocardial infarction, but until then biochemical markers should be used in conjunction with clinical assessment and electrocardiography in making the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, and the patients should not be treated merely on the basis of elevated serum levels of cardiac biochemical markers."
CD010864,0,7631314,0,A new sensitive membrane based ELISA technique for instantaneous D.Dimer evaluation in emergency.,"D.Dimer is currently used as a diagnotic help in thromboembolic events. The first application widely validated concerns the exclusion diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. In this context D.Dimer measurements must be performed individually and they must offer a good accuracy in evaluating the clinical decision threshold which is of 0.5 micrograms/ml when D.Dimer is expressed as initial fibrinogen equivalent. For this objective we report a new membrane based ELISA technique, which uses an immunofiltration device and two complementary monoclonal antibodies. The first one is coated onto the membrane and is used for the D.Dimer capture. The bound analyte is then revealed later using the second monoclonal antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase. The assay is performed in less than 10 minutes and it can be used instantaneously by the clinical laboratories in emergency situations. Only 200 microliters of a standard citrated plasma are required. All samples containing more than 0.5 micrograms/ml D.Dimer produce a color development which intensity is a relation of the D.Dimer concentration. All specimen with levels below 0.3 micrograms/ml give negative tests, whereas a grey zone is present between 0.3 and 0.5 micrograms/ml. This assay offers all the specifications required by its applications to the exclusion diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism."

Because fibrin is the main component of a thrombus, deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism may be excluded with a predictive value of more than 95%, provided D-dimer plasma concentration is below a critical, assay-dependent cutoff. The D-dimer test is thus an ideal screening step in outpatients clinically suspected of venous thromboembolism. Only ELISA tests have been validated in clinical practice at present time for this indication, sensitivity of latex assays being insufficient."
CD010864,0,22159451,0,Circulating microRNAs: novel biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small, non-coding, single-stranded RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression via translational inhibition or mRNA degradation followed by protein synthesis repression. Many miRNAs are expressed in a tissue- and/or cell-specific manner and their expression patterns are reflective of underlying patho-physiologic processes. miRNAs can be detected in serum or in plasma in a remarkably stable form, making them attractive biomarkers for human diseases. This review describes the progress of identifying circulating miRNAs as novel biomarkers for diverse cardiovascular diseases, including acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, stroke, essential hypertension, and acute pulmonary embolism. In addition, the origin and function and the different strategies to identify circulating miRNAs as novel biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases are also discussed. Rarely has an opportunity arisen to advance such new biology for the diagnosis of cardiac diseases."
CD010864,0,1438672,0,Laboratory investigation in the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism.,"Laboratory findings were compared with lung scans in a prospective study of 260 patients undergoing ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning for suspected pulmonary thromboembolism. The best discrimination between different lung scan results was obtained from the level of plasma cross-linked fibrin degradation products, every patient with a scan indicating a high probability of thromboembolism having detectable levels. An acute phase response was demonstrated in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism by a raised neutrophil count and elevated levels of plasma fibrinogen and serum C-reactive protein. A normal level of serum C-reactive protein and/or plasma cross-linked fibrin degradation productions in blood taken within 4 days of onset of symptoms virtually excluded the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism. Detection of free plasma DNA was not helpful in discriminating between groups with different lung scan results. Discriminant analysis was used to assess the variables examined and to derive diagnostic models. An accuracy of 78 per cent was obtained with one model for classifying test patients according to the three lung scan classes of low, intermediate and high probability. A second model, for distinguishing patients with a low and a high probability of pulmonary thromboembolism on the basis of lung scans, and a third for predicting those with a low probability on lung scan, were accurate in 94.6 per cent and 83.5 per cent of patients respectively. Discriminant models could be used in the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism, especially when diagnostic imaging is not available."

Plasma fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex, fibrin-D-dimer, activated protein C (APC)-protein C inhibitor (PCI) complex, von Willebrand factor (vWf), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), PA inhibitor-I (PAI-1), and thrombomodulin levels in both PE and DVT patients were significantly increased compared with normal volunteers. Plasma APC-PCI complex, PAI-1, and vWf levels in PE patients were significantly higher than those in DVT patients without PE. These findings indicate that PE patients are more hypercoagulable and hypofibrinolytic than DVT patients. Plasma TAT, APC-PCI complex, PAI-1, and vWf levels were the most sensitive indicators for PE. In these patients, increases in TAT and APC-PCI complex suggest DVT and increased PAI-1 and vWf suggest the risk of onset of PE."

CD010864,0,12627666,0,Antiphospholipid thrombosis syndromes.,"Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated strongly with thrombosis and are the most common of the acquired blood protein defects causing thrombosis. Although the precise mechanisms whereby antiphospholipid antibodies alter hemostasis to induce a hypercoagulable state remain unclear, numerous theories, as previously discussed, have been advanced. The most common thrombotic events associated with ACLAs are deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus (type I syndrome), coronary or peripheral artery thrombosis (type II syndrome), or cerebrovascular/retinal vessel thrombosis (type III syndrome), and occasionally patients present with mixtures (type IV syndrome). Patients with type V disease are those with antiphospholipid antibodies and RMS. It is as yet unclear how many seemingly normal individuals who may never develop manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (type VI) harbor asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibodies. The relative frequency of ACLAs in association with arterial and venous thrombosis strongly suggests that they should be looked for in any individual with unexplained thrombosis; all three idiotypes (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be assessed. Also, the type of syndrome (I-VI) should be defined, if possible, because this identification may dictate both the type and the duration of immediate and long-term anticoagulant therapy. Unlike those patients with ACLAs, patients with primary LA-thrombosis syndrome usually have venous thrombosis. Because the aPTT is unreliable in patients with LA (prolonged in only approximately 40%-50% of patients) and usually is not prolonged in patients with ACLAs, definitive tests, including ELISA for ACLA, the dilute Russell's viper venom time for LA, hexagonal phospholipid-neutralization procedure, and B-2-GP-I (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be ordered immediately when suspecting antiphospholipid syndrome or in individuals with otherwise unexplained thrombotic or thromboembolic events. If these test results are negative, subgroups also should be assessedin the appropriate clinical setting. Most patients with antiphospholipid thrombosis syndrome will fail to respond to warfarin therapy, and except for retinal vascular thrombosis, may fail some types of antiplatelet therapy, so it is of major importance to make this diagnosis so patients can be treated with the most effective therapy for secondary prevention-LMWH or unfractionated heparin in most instances and clopidogrel in some instances."

To deliver the candidate antigen on the surface, we fused the mpt64 gene to the sequence encoding the PE domain of the PE_PGRS33 protein of M. tuberculosis (to create strain (H)PE-ÎMPT64-BCG), which we have previously shown to transport proteins to the bacterial surface. In a series of protection experiments in the mouse model of tuberculosis, we showed that (i) immunization of mice with (H)PE-ÎMPT64-BCG provides levels of protection significantly higher than those afforded by the parental BCG strain, as assessed by bacterial colonization in lungs and spleens and by lung involvement (at both 28 and 70 days postchallenge), (ii) rBCG strains expressing MPT64 provide better protection than the parental BCG strain only when this antigen is surface expressed, and (iii) the (H)PE-ÎMPT64-BCG-induced MPT64-specific T cell repertoire when characterized by Î² chain variable region-Î² chain joining region (BV-BJ) spectratyping indicates that protection is correlated with the ability to recruit gamma interferon (IFN-Î³)-secreting T cells carrying the BV8.3-BJ1.5 (172 bp) shared rearrangement. These results demonstrate that (H)PE-ÎMPT64-BCG is one of the most effective new vaccines tested so far in the mouse model of tuberculosis and underscore the impact of antigen cellular localization on the induction of the specific immune response induced by rBCG."

Anti-CEA antibodies have been proved to be useful for targeting several cancer types known to express CEA. A recombinant immunotoxin was constructed, in which the cell-binding domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) was replaced with the single-chain Fv (scFv) of anti-CEA monoclonal antibody for targeting to colorectal carcinomas. This single-chain immunotoxin was expressed in E. coli and purified under denaturing condition of 6M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl). It was found that the immunotoxin maintains a binding activity in denaturing condition of 6M GuHCl and the fused PE contributes to the stability of immunotoxin in such condition.

CD010864,0,6166634,0,Alpha2-plasmin inhibitor and alpha2-macroglobulin-plasmin complexes in plasma. Quantitation by an enzyme-linked differential antibody immunosorbent assay.,"An enzyme-linked differential antibody immunosorbent assay has been developed for the quantification of alpha2-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin and alpha2-macroglobulin-plasmin complexes. In this method the inhibitor-plasmin complex is bound to a surface by an inhibitor-specific antibody, and the plasmin bound to the inhibitor is quantified by a second antibody, rabbit antiplasminogen F(ab')2, labeled with alkaline phosphatase. The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate by the alkaline phosphatase is expressed in femtomoles of plasminogen per milliliter, by reference to a standard plasminogen curve. Inhibitor-enzyme complexes were generated in plasma by the addition of plasmin or of urokinase. The concentration of plasmin added was well below the plasma concentration of alpha2-plasmin inhibitor (1 microM) or of alpha2-macroglobulin (3.5 microM), so that neither inhibitor would be fully saturated with enzyme. Under these conditions increasing amounts of plasmin generated an increase in both alpha2-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin and alpha2-macroglobulin-plasmin complexes. Varying amounts of plasmin were incubated with each of the purified inhibitors in the concentration found in plasma, and the complexes. Varying amounts of plasmin were incubated with each of the purified inhibitors in the concentration found in plasma, and the complexes that formed were quantified by immunoassay. These studies made it possible to quantify the distribution of plasmin between the two inhibitors in plasmin or urokinase-treated plasma. In plasmin-treated plasma, 10% or less of the plasmin bound to both inhibitors was in complex with alpha2-macroglobulin. In contrast, between 19 and 51% of the plasmin generated in urokinase-activated plasma was bound to alpha2-macroglobulin. Thus, major changes in the distribution of plasma were observed, according to whether plasmin was added to plasma or whether plasminogen was activated endogenously. The pattern of inhibitor plasmin complexes generated in vivo by the therapeutic infusion of urokinase was similar to that found for urokinase-activated plasma. 23 normal individuals had low levels of alpha2-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complexes, whereas six patients with laboratory evidence for disseminated intravascular coagulation demonstrated a 16- to 35-fold increase in he concentration of these complexes. These data indicated that a useful new probe for the study of the fibrinolytic enzyme system had been developed."
CD010864,0,19228602,0,Venous thromboembolism: risk factors for recurrence.,"Patients who have a first episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have an elevated risk of a recurrent episode, and this necessitates secondary prophylaxis. Anticoagulant therapy is a double-edged sword, however, as it reduces the risk of recurrent VTE but increases the risk of hemorrhage. This balance must be taken into account when assessing the risk-benefit ratio of long-term anticoagulation. Some clinical characteristics of the index VTE event can help to categorize the individual risk of recurrence. Patients with persistent risk factors such as cancer have a significantly higher risk of recurrent thrombosis. In contrast, VTE provoked by transient risk factors is associated with a lower risk of recurrence. Intrinsic features of patients with VTE (gender, age, hereditary thrombophilia) have also been linked to the risk of recurrent VTE. There is increasing evidence that a normal D-dimer level and the absence of residual venous thrombosis after discontinuation of oral anticoagulation are associated with a lower risk of recurrent VTE events. Future studies are needed to refine the predictive value of known risk factors for VTE recurrence and to discover better markers."
CD010864,0,15136509,0,Spiral computed tomography for acute pulmonary embolism.,"There is still considerable debate about the optimal diagnostic imaging modality for acute pulmonary embolism. If imaging is deemed necessary from an initial clinical evaluation such as d-dimer testing, options include nuclear medicine scanning, catheter pulmonary angiography, and spiral CT. In many institutions, spiral CT is becoming established as the first-line imaging test in daily clinical practice. With spiral CT, thrombus is directly visualized, and both mediastinal and parenchymal structures are evaluated, which may provide important alternative or additional diagnoses. However, limitations for the accurate diagnosis of small peripheral emboli, with a reported miss rate of up to 30% with single-slice spiral CT so far, have prevented the unanimous embrace of spiral CT as the new standard of reference for imaging pulmonary embolism. The clinical significance of the detection and treatment of isolated peripheral pulmonary emboli is uncertain. Evidence is accumulating that it is safe practice to withhold anticoagulation in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism on the basis of a negative spiral CT study. Remaining concerns about the accuracy of spiral CT for pulmonary embolism detection may be overcome by the introduction of multidetector-row spiral CT. This widely available technology has improved visualization of peripheral pulmonary arteries and detection of small emboli. The most recent generation of multidetector-row spiral CT scanners appears to outperform competing imaging modalities for the accurate detection of central and peripheral pulmonary embolism. In this review, we assess the current role and future potential of CT in the diagnostic algorithm of acute pulmonary embolism."

CD010864,0,20626551,0,Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: the answers to ten questions.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3-month period with a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2-3. This initial period of 3 months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable benefit-risk balance are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future.

CD010864,0,12941028,0,The utility of pretest probability assessment in patients with clinically suspected venous thromboembolism.,"The assessment of pretest probability (PTP), with stratification into low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups is an essential initial step in the current diagnostic management of patients with suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). In combination with additional information, it reduces the need for initial and supplementary imaging, and allows considerable refinement of the posterior probability of VTE following non-invasive imaging. PTP may be assessed either empirically or by using various decision rules or scoring systems, the best known of which are the simplified Wells scores for suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and the Geneva score for suspected PE. Each of these approaches shows similar directional and categorical accuracy, and has been validated as facilitating clinically useful classification of the PTP, although an overview of data suggests that fewer patients tend to be classified as low PTP when assessed empirically. This group is the most important to identify, as several outcome studies have shown that imaging and treatment are safely obviated in outpatients with suspected DVT or PE who have a low PTP in combination with negative d-dimer testing, a subgroup accounting for up to half of all patients studied. Hence, while probably not of critical importance, the explicit approach offered by scoring systems might be preferred over empirical assessment, particularly when used by more junior staff."

CD010864,0,21047581,0,Mortality risk assessment and the role of thrombolysis in pulmonary embolism.,"Acute venous thromboembolism remains a frequent disease, with an incidence ranging between 23 and 69 cases per 100,000 population per year. Of these patients, approximately one-third present with clinical symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and two-thirds with deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Recent registries and cohort studies suggest that approximately 10% of all patients with acute PE die during the first 1 to 3 months after diagnosis. Overall, 1% of all patients admitted to hospitals die of acute PE, and 10% of all hospital deaths are PE-related. These facts emphasize the need to better implement our knowledge on the pathophysiology of the disease, recognize the determinants of death or major adverse events in the early phase of acute PE, and most importantly, identify those patients who necessitate prompt medical, surgical, or interventional treatment to restore the patency of the pulmonary vasculature."

CD010864,0,15296648,0,Intracellular IFN-gamma production and IL-12 serum levels in latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) and in type 2 diabetes.,"Th1 cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and Th1-inducing cytokines, such as IL-12, are involved in the pathogenesis of various organ-specific autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune diabetes. In this study, we investigated intracellular IFN-gamma release by T lymphocytes and IL-12 serum levels in 48 type 2 and 36 latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) diabetics and 25 control subjects in an attempt to evaluate their role in the pathogenesis of these clinical entities. Ionomycin (ION) and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stained with anti-CD4-FITC or anti-CD8-FITC and anti-IFN-gamma phycoerythrin (PE) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and analyzed by flow cytometry. IL-12 serum levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In all study groups, IFN-gamma content of CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes was significantly upregulated by stimulation. Furthermore, it was observed that CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes from type 2 diabetics produced significantly lower levels of IFN-gamma compared with LADA patients and controls. However, the percentages of CD4(+)/IFN-gamma(+) and CD8(+)/IFN-gamma(+) cells from type 2 diabetics were significantly higher compared with controls. The flow cytometric picture of intracellular IFN-gamma release in LADA patients did not differ from that observed in controls. However, IL-12 serum levels in type 2 and LADA diabetics were lower than in controls. Because Th1 cytokines have been associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes, these results preclude Th1 involvement in the autoimmune phenomena observed in LADA patients. In contrast, the low IFN-gamma levels observed in type 2 diabetics in combination with the low IL-12 serum levels might be a contributing factor in the frequently observed chronic complications in these patients."

CD010864,0,16344726,0,Sonography for deep venous thrombosis: current and future applications.,"Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a one of the most common problems facing the clinician in medicine today. It is often asymptomatic and goes undiagnosed with potentially fatal consequences. Ultrasound has become the ""gold standard"" in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and with proper attention to technique sensitivity of this test is approximately 97%. An understanding of anatomy, pathophysiology, and risk factors is important. Thrombus formation usually begins beneath a valve leaflet below the knee. Approximately 40% will resolve spontaneously, 40% will become organized, and 20% will propagate. Whether or not a calf vein thrombus is identified, a repeat examination in 7 to 10 days is recommended in patients with risk factors or when deep venous thrombosis is suspected. The three main risk factors for thrombus formation are age greater than 75 years, previous history of deep venous thrombosis, and underlying malignancy. Other diagnostic studies include the contrast venogram, CT or MRI venogram, Tc99m Apcitide study, and the laboratory test D-Dimer. The D-Dimer study is being used more frequently as a screening test with 99% sensitivity in detecting thrombus, whether deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. However, specificity is only approximately 50% with many conditions leading to false-positive exams. Therefore, a negative examination is useful in avoiding other diagnostic studies, but a positive one may be misleading. Conditions that can lead to a false-positive examination include, but are not limited to diabetes, pregnancy, liver disease, heart conditions, recent surgery, and some gastrointestinal diseases. Like the sonogram, two negative D-Dimer studies a week apart exclude the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. Compression sonography with color Doppler remains the best overall test for deep venous thrombosis. It is easy to perform, less expensive than most ""high tech"" studies, can be performed as a portable examination, and is highly reliable when done properly."

CD010864,0,8771700,0,Comparison of four rapid D-Dimer tests for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Aim of this study was to evaluate rapid D-Dimer tests for their utility in diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Tests were performed in 183 consecutive pats referred for lung scanning because of clinically suspected PE. According to lung scans and the clinical course of disease 19 pats were classified to have PE with high probability and 164 with low probability. An ELISA (Agen) was used as the D-Dimer reference, and results compared with those of a turbidimetric (Behring), an immunofiltration (Nycomed), latex plasma and whole blood agglutination test (both Agen). There was a poor correlation between the turbidimetric test and either the ELISA (R = 0.38) and immunofiltration test (R = 0.49). The correlation between the ELISA and immunofiltration test was better (R = 0.73). The qualitative latex and whole blood agglutination tests were better fitted to ELISA since positive and negative samples were overlapped only in their 1st and 9th percentiles of ELISA values. The whole blood agglutination test was positive at lower ELISA values than the latex test. The highest sensitivity test for PE was the immunofiltration test (95%) (500ng/mL cut-off), followed by the turbidimetric method (89%) (66ng/mL), the ELISA (89%) (300ng/mL), the whole blood test (88%) and the latex test (68%). Specificity was lowest for the immunofiltration test (33%), intermediate (57-65%) for the turbidimetric and whole blood agglutination tests, and highest for the ELISA and the most insensitive latex test (76/77%). The whole blood assay was found to be the fastest and most suitable for bed site testing but weak positives were difficult to read. The immunofiltration test required plasma preparation but allowed objective semiquantitation of results. The less rapid turbidimetric assay was fully quantitative and objective."
CD010864,0,21325250,0,Evaluation of performance including influence by interfering substances of the Innovance D-dimer assay on the Sysmex coagulation analyzer.,"D-dimer is formed during activation of the coagulation system and is commonly assayed in order to diagnose disseminated intravascular coagulation, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been validated as the reference method, but it is a time-consuming procedure. The objective of this study was to evaluate a new immunoturbidimetric, particle-enhanced, Innovance(Â®) D-dimer immunoassay. A total of 129 plasma samples from apparently healthy individuals and 298 samples from patients were collected for linearity, precision, and correlation studies. Testing the precision of low- and high-controls yielded CV values of 2.08% and 1.76%, respectively. The central 95% non-parametric reference interval estimated from healthy controls was 0.093-0.68 mg/L Fibrinogen Equivalent Units (FEU; median, 0.26 mg/L FEU). Comparison analysis yielded acceptable correlation with the STA Liatest(Â®) D-dimer assay (R(2) = 0.9471). At a cut-off level of <0.5 mg/L FEU, the sensitivity and specificity indices of the Innovance D-dimer assay were 99.7% and 89.1%, respectively. Thus the Innovance D-dimer method showed acceptable precision and linearity, and the assay results showed acceptable correlation with the STA Liatest D-dimer method. The Innovance method was relatively unaffected by potential interfering substances such as bilirubin and hemoglobin. In conclusion, the Innovance D-dimer assay is suitable for monitoring D-dimer concentrations in various clinical conditions and should be useful in clinical laboratories."
CD010864,0,16568195,0,New diagnostic and treatment modalities for pulmonary embolism: one path through the confusion.,"Pulmonary embolism is one of the greatest diagnostic challenges in emergency medicine. New techniques and strategies constantly arise for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. A review of the new diagnostic and treatment modalities for pulmonary embolism (PE) suggests that it should be suspected in any patient with unexplained dyspnea, tachypnea, or chest pain. All patients suspected of PE must be risk stratified, ideally with a criteria-validated clinical decision rule. After assessing pre-test probability, D-dimer assays will reliably exclude PE in the low risk group and no further imaging is warranted. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram is the initial imaging study of choice for stable patients. V/Q scans should be used only when CT is not available or if the patient has a contraindication to CT scans or intravenous contrast. Bedside echocardiography or stabilization of the patient and CT angiogram are the initial tests for suspected massive PE. If PE is confirmed, hypotensive patients should be treated with thrombolytics. Both heparin and low molecular weight heparin are equally effective initial treatments for stable patients with suspected or confirmed PE. Because accurate screening and identification of pulmonary embolism frequently requires more than a single test, knowledge of existing diagnostic techniques allows an evidence-based strategy for diagnosis. New therapeutic choices may benefit patients with confirmed pulmonary embolism."

In recent years, this laboratory test has been most frequently used for other purposes: to detect the activation of coagulation, to predict the course of diseases, and to determine the duration of anticoagulant therapy. Our investigation examined 1514 D-dimer measurements in 1370 outpatients without acute abnormalities, including 72 patients receiving warfarin and 32 patients after myocardial revascularization. 36.1% of cases were found to have values of more than 0.5 mkg/ml. Adequate anticoagulant therapy (INR 2-3) caused a reduction in the level of D-dimer that is an important additional laboratory test for the evaluation of antithrombotic defense. Further investigations are needed to determine cutoff values for various clinical situations."

CD010864,0,11260841,0,[The best in 2000 on thrombosis].,"It is nearly impossible to follow and integrate all the new information in each subspeciality of cardiology. In the last months, important data has been published which may change clinical practice. In this domain, over half the cases of suspected coronary chest pain would only require a very short stay in a chest pain unit. The history, an accurate evaluation of symptoms, the application of Bayesian analysis, ECG interpretation and serum troponine measurement, associated with a degree of clinical experience, will allow orientation of the patient to a coronary care unit or hospital discharge (with possible out-patient referral). Patients with true unstable angina will no longer be treated by continuous intravenous injection of non-fractionated heparin because, in theory and in practice, this has been replaced with subcutaneous LMW heparin.... On the other hand, the electric syringe will continue to be required for the integration of the anti-GPIIB-IIIA for the treatment of unstable angina after the recommendations published concomitantly in the United States and Europe. This type of patient, especially with a ""positive"" troponine, will probably not be kept waiting long before referral to the catheter laboratory for coronary angiography and revascularisation. The long-term results of the FRISC II trial are confirmed by an even earlier invasive approach (Tactics-Timi 18) using anti-GPIIb-IIIa. In the first hours, and independently of other older prognostic factors, it will be possible to ""predict or compare"" the risk of coronary recurrence based on the results of certain biological ""markers"". In many centres, cases with ST elevation on the ECG could well be included in a phase III ""medical protocol"", associating a half-dose thrombolytic and an anti-GPIIb-IIIa. Finally, patients who will have been admitted to the chest pain unit with a suspected pulmonary embolism, for example because they had not been treated prophylactically with aspirin before hip surgery, will probably have the choice, after d-dimer measurement, between pulmonary scintigraphy and helicoidal CT scan. If the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is confirmed, a single subcutaneous injection of LMW heparin could replace the conventional continuous intravenous injection of heparin. The earliest possible oral anticancer ... pardon me I anticoagulant treatment should be prescribed and explained."

Our objective was to determine prospectively whether there is a positive association between anticardiolipin antibodies and venous thromboembolism in ostensibly healthy adults. We conducted a nested case-control study (n = 317 patients and n = 655 control subjects) in a longitudinal study of over 20 000 participants. Baseline (prediagnosis) anticardiolipin IgG and IgM antibodies were assessed by enzyme-linked immunoassays. Venous thromboembolism was validated using standardized criteria for venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. There was no association between anticardiolipin antibodies and subsequent venous thromboembolism occurrence, overall or in any subgroup. For example, the multivariate-adjusted relative risk was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.43, 1.78) for greater than versus less than the 95th percentile of anticardiolipin IgG. In conclusion, in this general population sample, an elevated anticardiolipin antibody level was not a risk factor for venous thromboembolism."

Among the PEs tested, pea pod PE presented the most remarkable catalysis on the transacylation reaction, and 1.5% pectin solution was determined to be suitable for this reaction. Low methoxy pectin with a DE (degree of esterification) of 31% displayed a slow turbidity increase, revealing that the extent of DE was influential on the transacylation. Besides citrus pectin, apple pectin was also proved to progress transacylation reaction by PEs from tomato and citrus sources as apparently observed by turbidity method."

The systemic effects of shed blood are still unclear. We studied the effect of residual substances in the retransfused shed blood, on lung perfusion after TKA. Fifteen unilateral and one bilateral TKAs were performed with autotransfusion (the study group) and 15 unilateral and three bilateral TKAs were performed in a control group. Lung X-rays, arterial blood gases (ABG), D-dimer values, and lung perfusion scintigraphies were performed preoperatively and postoperatively. A mean of 300.0 +/- 335.6 ml of bank blood was needed in the autotransfusion group and a mean of 685.7 +/- 365.5 ml of bank blood was needed in the control group (p=0.001). There was a postoperative segmental perfusion defect at the lateral segment of the superior lobe of the left lung in one patient of the control group and he also had risk factors for thrombosis. Although both groups had a decrease in lung perfusion postoperatively, there were no significant differences among the groups regarding the lung perfusion scintigraphy, chest X-rays, ABG, and D-dimer values. In conclusion, although pulmonary perfusion diminishes following TKA, shed blood retransfusion does not add any risk to pulmonary perfusion."

This study used enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) to measure 90K in pleural effusions (PEs) and sera from patients with MM (n=28), lung cancer (LC) (n=14) and benign pleural disease (BPD) (n=15). Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate 90K expression in MM and LC tissue sections. The expression of 90K was further evaluated in vitro by ELISA and western blot analysis of conditioned media and cellular extracts of MM, LC and normal human mesothelial (NHM) cell cultures. Finally, the relationships between 90K expression in MM and patient age and survival were studied. The mean 90K level was significantly higher (p<0.05) in PEs of MM patients (11.0+/-6.6 microg/ml) than in LC (6.1+/-3.2 microg/ml) or BPD (6.2+/-5.0 microg/ml) patients. Immunohistochemistry showed a positive reaction for 90K in MM biopsy sections and positive staining limited to inflammatory infiltrates in LC sections. The level of 90K was significantly higher in cell culture media of MM than of LC or NHM (p<0.001). Bands representing proteins with molecular weight of approximately 90 kDa were detected by western blot in MM cellular extracts. An inverse correlation between PE 90K levels and MM patient age (r=-0.45; p=0.017) and a positive correlation between serum 90K levels and MM patient survival (r=0.62; p=0.006) were detected by linear regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis showed increased survival probability for MM patients with serum 90K level >7.3 microg/ml (log rank, p<0.05).

The determination of D-dimer levels is both a diagnostic and a cost savings tool to rule out VTE. The assay can be used to eliminate those individuals without VTE, but with low or moderate clinical suspicion. The D-dimer assay is inexpensive, automated, has a rapid turnaround time, and uses standard blue-top tubes. After appropriate validation, the assay can be 100 percent sensitive in ruling out DVT or PE, but it will not confirm the presence of VTE as numerous other diseases and procedures can increase levels. The assay should not be used routinely on inpatients or surgery patients. Caution should be used when interpreting results from patients on anticoagulation therapy, since lower D-dimer levels may be found. If properly used, the D-dimer assay can save a healthcare facility significant money by eliminating imaging studies on patients with low or moderate suspicion of DVT or PE."

Clinical and patient history data are essential for the diagnosis and evaluation of the clinical risk of pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism, particularly during minor episodes, was primarily identified by abnormalities in D-dimer concentration during laboratory testing. Indeed, an increase in D-dimer plasma levels was consequently identified as a valid diagnostic element for pulmonary embolism and therefore, in the absence of D-dimer abnormalities, a tendency to exclude such diagnosis exists. This case report describes the importance of carrying out level II diagnostic investigations which may be particularly valid in patients with a minimal rise in D-dimer levels and a clinical suspicion of a pulmonary embolism. This method allows for a quick diagnosis with early therapeutic measures which improve survival rates during the acute and critical phase."

In addition, we have previously noted a surprisingly high incidence (20.9%) of apparently true FXII deficiency in patients who were LA+. We have hypothesised that this may be partly due to the presence of antibodies to FXII. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether LA+ patient plasmas contain antibodies directed either against FXII or FXII in association with phospholipids. Plasma samples from 60 blood donors, all LA negative, and 51 LA+ patients were tested using ELISA assays employing purified FXII, phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). We have identified seven patients whose plasma contained either IgG or IgM that reacted with purified FXII in the absence of PS or PE. When PS was included in the assay system four additional patient plasmas were shown to contain either IgG or IgM that reacted with FXII. The plasma of one patient contained IgG that reacted with FXII both in the presence and absence of PS. There was no reactivity to FXII with either IgG or IgM when PE was included in the assay system.

He underwent plasma exchange (PE) three times during 4 days because his antibeta1-adrenergic receptor antibody titer was 160 times the background density on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. BNP titer decreased from 1320 pg/ml before to 506 pg/ml after PE. Dobutamine infusion was discontinued after PE because of improving cardiac function.

Our opinions on that continue to evolve. This manuscript attempts a snapshot reflecting the position of cardiac imaging and cardiac biomarkers in suspected and confirmed PE. Comparing the prognostic performance of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponins, it seems that with thresholds set appropriately high, troponins could be more helpful in the identification of patients with adverse prognosis while low BNP levels are reliable markers of good prognosis. Because of the relatively short plasma half-life, BNP as well as NT-proBNP could be repeated to monitor evolution of the hemodynamic status of the patient and the results of implemented treatment. The role of echocardiography outside massive PE seems to be decreasing, although if considered together with information provided on potential alternative or additional cardiovascular diseases as well as intracardiac or intravascular thrombi, its place in a tentative management algorithm in PE seems still secured."
CD010864,0,16270470,0,Pulmonary embolism: diagnostic algorithms.,"In 90% of cases the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) is raised by clinical signs and symptoms, while in only 10% of cases PE is suspected on the basis of electrocardiographic, arterial blood gas analysis or radiological findings. The combination of clinical signs and symptoms and the results of first-level diagnostic tests (electrocardiography, gas analysis and chest X-ray) allows a fairly accurate classification of patients with ""clinical suspicion of PE"" into three categories of clinical (or pre-test) probability: low, intermediate and high. The clinical diagnosis of PE is very often inaccurate making the use of additional tests, including imaging techniques, mandatory. The choice and the combination (= diagnostic algorithms) of second- and third-level diagnostic tests (D-dimer, venous ultrasound, echocardiography, lung scintigraphy, helical computed tomography and pulmonary angiography) depend primarily on the clinical conditions of patients and their pre-test probability. We propose two diagnostic algorithms: 1) a diagnostic algorithm for patients with clinically suspected PE and critical clinical conditions (unstable patients), 2) a diagnostic algorithm for patients with clinically suspected PE and non-critical clinical conditions (hemodynamically stable patients)."
CD010864,0,22706239,0,Candidate biochemical markers for screening of pre-eclampsia in early pregnancy.,"Pre-eclampsia (PE) and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of adverse outcomes. Their pathophysiology remains elusive, hampering the development of efficient prevention. The onset of HDP and PE and the severity of their clinical manifestations are heterogeneous. The advent of preventive measures, such as low-dose aspirin that targets high-risk women, emphasizes the need of better prediction. Until recently, only environmental information and maternal risk factors were considered, with equivocal predictive value. No validated screening procedures were available to identify at-risk women despite the emergence of Doppler ultrasonography parameters for the uterine artery (e.g., pulsatility index and bilateral notching) and pathophysiological biochemical markers (e.g., angiogenesis, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction). Owing to its heterogeneity and lack of specific, sensitive markers among those studied so far (>200), PE is unlikely to be detected early by a single predictive parameter. Systematic reviews have concluded that no single test fulfilling World Health Organization criteria for biomarker selection can diagnose/predict a disease. However, by combining antenatal risk factors, clinical parameters, as well as biophysical and biochemical markers into multivariate algorithms, the risk of PE can be estimated with performance levels that could reach clinical utility. Performance characteristics of selected algorithms will be presented and discussed with respect to transferability to different geographic and healthcare environments."

Non-specific findings make the clinical diagnosis of PE difficult. To assess the diagnostic value and inter-observer agreement of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in a cohort of patients with suspected PE, we conducted a prospective clinical study. MRA was compared for sensitivity and specificity to a diagnostic strategy including clinical probability, D-dimer testing, spiral CT, ultrasound leg compression and pulmonary angiography. A total of 89 patients with clinically suspected PE were included: the clinical probability of PE was intermediate or high in 78, and low in the remaining 11. All patients underwent monoor multi-slice spiral CT and MRA with gadolinium injection (both within 24 hours of entry to the study). Anticoagulation was withheld in patients concerned about the strategy. All subjects were followed up for 3 months. MRA was read independently by two experienced teams of radiologists: one local and one from another university centre. Spiral CT was positive in 62 of 63 cases of confirmed PE. No patient with negative CT findings was positive ultrasonographically. Only one patient with a negative CT (and negative ultrasound) had a recurrent thromboembolic event. The first team diagnosed PE with MRA in 47 cases, with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 92%; the second team obtained the diagnosis in 23 cases, with a sensitivity of 31% and a specificity of 85%. Inter-observer agreement between MRA reading was low: Kappa = 0.16 (-0.01 to 0.33); p = 0.07. In conclusion, compared with a non-invasive strategy based on spiral CT, the diagnostic value of MRA is limited by poor inter-observer agreement."

The rate of TEE during the 6 months following the initiation of chemotherapy was assessed in 100 consecutive patients with GCT and in 100 controls with various neoplasms who were matched on sex and age, and who received first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy during the same period of time at Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France. Data were subsequently tested on a validation group of 77 GCT patients treated in Lyon, France. A total of 19 patients (19%) (95% confidence interval (CI): 13-28) and six patients (6%) (95% CI: 3-13) had a TEE in the GCT group and the non-GCT control group, respectively (relative risk (RR): 3.4; P<0.01). Three patients from the GCT group died of pulmonary embolism. In multivariate analysis, two factors had independent predictive value for TEE: a high body surface area (>1.9 m2) (RR: 5 (1.8-13.9)) and an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (RR: 6.4 (2.3-18.2)). Patients with no risk factor (n=26) and those with at least one risk factor (n=71) had a probability of having a TEE of 4% (95% CI: 1-19) and 26% (95% CI: 17-37), respectively. In the GCT validation set, 10 (13%) patients had a TEE; patients with no risk factor and those with at least one risk factor had a probability of having a TEE of 0 and 17% (95% CI: 10-29), respectively. Patients with GCT are at a higher risk for TEE than patients with non-GCT cancer while on cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This risk can be accurately predicted by serum LDH and body surface area. This predictive index may help to study prospectively the impact of thromboprophylaxis in GCT patients."

CD010864,0,9974375,0,"A new enzyme immunoassay for soluble fibrin in plasma, with a high discriminating power for thrombotic disorders.","Fibrin formation is a multistep process initiated by thrombin. At first thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin molecules which in vivo form soluble complexes with fibrinogen. Soluble fibrin is considered to be an early biochemical marker for intravascular fibrin formation and impending thrombotic events, such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). A new enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was developed on the basis of a monoclonal antibody directed against a fibrin specific neo-epitope located on the gamma-chain of fibrinogen; gamma-(312-324). In addition, it was possible to prepare a lyophilized reference material of thrombin-generated soluble fibrin, that allowed for full antigen recovery after reconstitution with buffer. Assay conditions, e.g. solid phase-Ig concentration and buffer composition, sample and conjugate dilution, and incubation times were optimised. The present assay was found to be specific (no interference of homologous antigens) and reproducible (intra-assay CV 4-8%, interassay CV 4-9%), and therefore highly suited for measuring soluble fibrin levels in a plasma milieu. The median normal value for soluble fibrin was determined in plasma samples obtained from apparently healthy volunteers (n = 81) and found to be 0.040 microg/ml, with a range (10-90 percentiles) of 0.026-0.059 microg/ml. A retrospective study showed that soluble fibrin levels were highly significantly increased in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of DIC (median 1.042 microg FEU/ml, range 0.160-2.319 microg/ml, n = 21, P<0.0001 vs. normal). PE (median 0.527 microg FEU/ml, range 0.084-1.234 microg/ml, n = 29, P<0.0001 vs normal) and DVT (median 0.126 microg FEU/ml, range 0.059-0.878 microg/ml, n = 36, P<0.0001 vs. normal), as determined by the Mann-Whitney U-Test."

CD010864,0,14518082,0,[D-dimers in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis].,"D-dimers (D-d) are degeneration products of fibrin. According to some recommendations (Lee et al., Ann Rev Med, 2002; 53: 15-33) the vein thromboembolism may be excluded by the determination of D-dimers level especially when the probability of diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is less strong. The determination of D-dimers with made possible was the development of monoclonal antibodies and their detection is based on the determination using the principle of ELISA or agglutination techniques. An increased D-d level is not completely specific for venous thrombo-embolism; it may be enhanced during tumorous diseases, infections, kidney failure etc. In contrast, a negative result of the test is highly sensitive for exclusion of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (sensitivity 90% to 100%). The authors also present their own results of a prospective study on the dynamism of D-dimer level in plasma of patients with deep vein thrombosis demonstrated by sonography at the time of start and in the course of the anticoagulant therapy. D-dimers were determined by two methods, the quantitative agglutination latex method and the rapid VIDAS ELISA method. At the time of admission, an increased level was established in up to 80% of patients using the VIDAS method and in 70% using the latex method. In the period of five to seven days after the beginning of treatment the proportions were 75% and 60%, respectively, according to the method used. After six weeks, a slightly elevated level above normal may be expected in 1/3 of patients and less than in 1/5 of patients in the later months."
CD010864,0,10445613,0,Contribution of noninvasive evaluation to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in hospitalized patients.,"The effectiveness of new diagnostic tools for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), such as clinical probability assessment, plasma D-dimer (DD) measurement and lower limb venous compression ultrasonography (US), has not been specifically studied in patients with a suspected PE occurring during hospital stay. This study applied a sequential, decision analysis-based strategy adding these instruments to a ventilation/perfusion lung scan in a cohort of 114 consecutive inpatients clinically suspected of PE in order to establish in how many patients a pulmonary angiogram could thereby be avoided. A definitive diagnosis could be established by the noninvasive protocol in 61% of these patients: normal/near-normal lung scan, 14%; high probability lung scan, 19%; clinical probability combined with lung scan result, 18%; and US, 8%. Specificity of DD was only 7% and contributed to the exclusion of PE in only two patients. Pulmonary angiography was required in 39% of patients. The 3-month thromboembolic risk in patients in whom PE was excluded by the diagnostic process was 0% (95% confidence interval 0-4.9%). In conclusion, a noninvasive work-up for suspected pulmonary embolism is effective in hospitalized patients, allowing to forego angiography in 61% of them, and it appears to be safe, although this should be further investigated. In contrast to outpatients, D-dimer measurement appears to be useless in hospitalized patients."

Also, to also evaluate if natriuretic peptide type-B (NT-proBNP) plasma levels are associated with right ventricle function and pulmonary arterial pressures. Interventional study: Fourteen normotensive adult patients with acute and radiologically massive pulmonary embolism plus positive biomarkers and evidences of right ventricle dysfunction underwent invasive pulmonary angiography for invasive treatment consisting on mechanical thrombus fragmentation and catheter-directed intrathrombus thrombolysis. Angiography was repeated after 12-24 h to reevaluate perfusion status. Plasma biomarkers were monitored before and 8-h after intervention. Biomarkers were initially elevated in all patients. Eleven patients (78.6%) exhibited significant angiographic reperfusion. NT-proBNP and mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased significantly in all of them [3693 (1803, 8862) to 1951 (1309, 7918) pg/ml; P = 0.008) and 40.0 (24.0, 46.0) to 22.0 (14.0, 27.0) mmHg; P = 0.003, respectively]. No significant variation was observed in troponin-T levels.

In pulmonary embolism, serial measurements of NT-proBNP could be useful as a tracking tool to assess the success or failure of the thrombolytic treatment."

Levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-I, tissue type plasminogen activator, and von Willebrand factor antigens were also significantly increased in patients with PE. Plasma level of APC-PCI complex was increased in most patients with PE and APC-alpha 1 antitrypsin complex level was increased in 13 patients. These complexes were not detected in healthy volunteers. These findings suggested that plasma protein C was activated in patients with PE, and that PCI was the major inhibitor of APC generated in this condition. Thus, regulation of the protein C pathway might play an important role in the pathogenesis of PE."

Some manufacturers have recommended a maximum daily dose of LMWH not to be exceeded. The purpose of this study was to determine if body weight influenced the anticoagulant response to a weight-based dose of LMWH for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Patients with serum creatinine levels < 150 micromol/l receiving the LMWH, dalteparin 200 anti-Xa IU/kg based on actual body weight subcutaneously once daily for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, were eligible for the study. Patients received a minimum of 5 days LMWH treatment. Patients had peak anti-Xa levels (IL Test Chromogenic assay) measured 3-4 h following their day 3 injection and trough anti-Xa levels measured immediately prior to injections on day 3 and 5. No dose adjustments were made on the basis of the anti-Xa levels. Patients were a priori stratified into three weight classes: (A) within 20% of ideal body weight (IBW) (n = 13); (B) 20-40% of IBW (n = 14), and (C) greater than 40% of IBW (n = 10). The largest patient weighed 190 kg and had a body mass index of 58. Mean daily LMWH doses were 14,030, 17,646 and 23, 565 IU for groups A, B and C, respectively. Mean (SD) trough anti-Xa levels on day 3 were 0.12 (0.05) anti-Xa IU/ml for group A, 0.11 (0.03) anti-Xa IU/ml for group B and 0.11 (0.03) anti-Xa IU/ml for group C (p > 0.2). Similar trough anti-Xa levels were observed on day 5. Mean (SD) peak anti-Xa levels on day 3 were 1.01 (0.20) anti-Xa IU/ml, 0.97 (0.21) anti-Xa IU/ml and 1.12 (0.22) anti-Xa IU/ml for groups A, B and C, respectively (p > 0.2). No thromboembolic or bleeding complications occurred during LMWH therapy in any patients. These findings suggest that body mass does not appear to have an important effect on the response to LMWH up to a weight of 190 kg in patients with normal or near normal renal function."

The diagnosis of these disorders can be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Assays for the detection of FDPs and D-dimer are used in many laboratories to investigate these disorders. The aim of this study was to compare plasma D-dimer levels obtained by the immuno-turdimetric method (Liatest D-Dimer Diagnostica Stago, AsniÃ¨res, France) with plasma FDPs were measured by latex agglutination to investigate the relationship between these parameters. These immunoassays were tested in 144 blood samples from patients with suspected disorders associated with activation of coagulation or fibrinolytic systems. D-dimer and FDPs assays were performed in plasma samples by the use of Liatest D-dimer and plasma FDPs (Diagnostica Stago), respectively. Patients were divided into four groups according to plasma D-dimer levels. In group 1, 47.4% had negative FDPs and 52.6% had positive FDPs. In group 2, 15.4% had negative FDPs and 84.6% had positive FDPs. In group 3, 10.3% had negative FDPs and 89.7% had positive FDPs. All of the patients in group 4 had positive FDPs. It was shown that plasma D-dimer levels measured by Liatest D-dimer have a relation to FDP levels measured by latex agglutination."

We report 2 cases of DVT whose diagnosis was made in the pediatric emergency department. Case 1 is a 9-year-old boy, evaluated with corticodependent nephrotic syndrome, who presented with pain in the lower left limb and increase in size of 48 hours' evolution suggestive of DVT. The elevation of D-dimer in the blood analysis and images from the Doppler ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis. His clinical evolution was good after beginning treatment with low molecular weight heparin. Case 2 is a 16-year-old adolescent, mother of a 1-year-old infant, who took oral contraceptives and was an occasional smoker, showed increased size and had pain in the lower left limb of a few hours' evolution. Deep vein thrombosis was suspected, and the diagnosis was confirmed by Doppler ultrasound. The evolution was favorable after beginning treatment with low molecular weight heparin. Although DVT is rare in children, early detection is important, requiring a detailed case history in the presence of edematous, painful, and hot limbs that are keys to the diagnostic suspicion.

Results suggest that the monitoring of D-dimer levels in infected dogs could be useful in evaluating the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism in the lungs and that microfilariae may induce microthrombosis in kidneys, thus contributing to renal pathology."
CD010864,0,21361081,0,Clinical roundtable monograph. The oncologist's role in management of venous thromboembolism.,"Thromboembolism is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and malignancy have a significantly higher probability of death. Pulmonary embolism can lead to a fatal outcome, and this condition often goes undiagnosed in cancer patients despite the presence of symptoms. Risk of VTE is increased by a number of clinical factors, which can be patient-derived, cancer-related, and treatment-related. Increasingly, clinicians are seeking predictable biomarkers to identify those patients at the greatest risk. To that end, a newly developed and validated predictive risk model may help identify patients who could benefit from prophylaxis. In addition, serum levels of coagulation cascade factors may predict the survival rate of cancer patients; elevated D-dimer levels are associated with decreased survival time. Anticoagulants, particularly low-molecular-weight heparin, can be useful in preventing the recurrence of clots in cancer patients with VTE. Current and future investigations are aimed at determining if prophylaxis with anticoagulants can improve patient survival. Future management strategies may involve the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or other novel anticoagulants as part of palliative care for high-risk patients. Although treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin can significantly reduce the risks of clots, the impact on cancer survival is unclear."

All injections contained adjuvant MF59, and subjects were grouped according to MTP-PE dose. Injections were given on days 0, 30, 180, and 365. The vaccine was well tolerated with limited local and systemic reactions. These immunizations induced rgp120SF2-specific binding antibodies that persisted > or = 24 weeks. After three immunizations, all subjects receiving the antigen developed neutralizing antibodies to HIVSF2, and serum from 67% of these subjects also cross-neutralized HIVMN. ELISA-reactive antibodies to the HIVSF2 V3 region and strong lymphoproliferative responses to HIVSF2 envelope proteins were detected in all rgp120SF2-immunized subjects."
CD010864,0,21114193,0,Deep vein thrombosis: review and update.,"Deep vein thrombosis is a common and serious medical condition, which frequently complicates the postoperative recovery of surgical patients with recognised/unrecognised risk factors. The pathophysiology of formation of blood clots in veins of lower extremities has now come in light after development of newer investigations. Newer imaging techniques allow the evaluation of peripheral venous system, which was previously unavailable. Pulmonary embolism remains the major early complication of deep vein thrombosis, although postphlebitic syndrome and recurrent deep vein thrombosis are other major complications. The risk of both pulmonary embolism and postphlebitic syndrome escalates in patients with recurrent deep vein thrombosis. Thus a correct evaluation of patients at high risk and proper management is mandatory. With the development of low molecular weight heparin, the incidence of postheparin bleeding has been reduced."
CD010864,0,19012320,0,SFMAC: a novel method for analyzing multiple parameters on lymphocytes with a single fluorophore in cell-microarray system.,"The analysis of single cells with multiple parameters in flow cytometry or microscopy requires suitable combinations of fluorophores and optical filters. The growing demands for the multiplex analysis of cells increase the requirements for developing new fluorophores and techniques. We have developed a novel method of analyzing a large number of cells with multiple parameters on a single-cell basis using a single fluorophore. Cells were arrayed onto a microwell array chip with an array of 45,000 microwells, which could capture single cells, stained with a phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibody to a marker, and analyzed with a cell-scanner. After analysis, we photobleached the PE molecules by irradiating the sample with blue light. Because the fluorescence of PE was not recovered after the photobleaching and the analyzed cells remained in the same microwells on the chip, we could repeatedly stain and analyze the same cells with other markers using PE. We applied a method of analyzing lymphocytes from 100 microL of peripheral blood for cytokine secretion and expression of intracellular proteins as well as for multiple cell surface markers. This novel method enables us to analyze multiple markers with a single fluorophore using a simple apparatus. The method may expand the scope of cytometry."

Its role in facilitating paradoxical arterial embolic events and as a potential site for thrombus formation however, has been reported in the literature. This case illustrates the protective filter-effect of the Chiari network in a 79-year-old Caucasian man with an unknown diagnosis of polycythaemia rubra vera who presented with clinical signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Transoesophageal echocardiogram confirmed entrapment of a thrombus within the Chiari network, which was not visualised following treatment on repeat scanning 1 month later. Here the authors describe how the Chiari network may have prevented the occurrence of a fatal massive pulmonary embolism in a patient with a high pro-thrombotic tendency, and review the current literature regarding the action of this anatomic variant as risk factor or protector."

CD010864,0,15116261,0,Human alpha -defensins neutralize fibrinolytic activity exerted by staphylokinase.,"Defensins, cationic peptides with bacteriolytic properties, are abundantly found at inflammation sites and in human coronary vessels. Vascular occlusive diseases, such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and peripheral arterial occlusion are presently treated by thrombolytic intervention using staphylokinase, a plasminogen activator of bacterial origin. In this study we assessed a possible interaction between defensins and staphylokinase, both molecules being present in an acutely ill patient. Using an ELISA-based system, we found that staphylokinase and defensins displayed a strong and dose-dependent binding. In contrast, urokinase, another plasminogen activator of endogenous origin, displayed only minimal binding to defensins. Next, we proved that interaction between staphylokinase and defensins led to functional consequences resulting in a significant decrease (p<0.002) of plasminogen activation capacity upon complex formation. In contrast, urokinase retained most of its activity even in 10-fold molar excess of defensins. Finally, we found that staphylokinase-triggered lysis of fibrin was efficiently inhibited in the presence of defensins. To assess structural requirements for staphylokinase/defensin interaction, six staphylokinase mutant variants were studied. Inactivation pattern of the tested staphylokinase variants suggested a direct binding of defensins to serine protease-like domain of staphylokinase. In conclusion, we show complex formation between staphylokinase and alpha-defensins resulting in a significant reduction of fibrinolytic activity. This finding may have clinical implications, since fibrinolytic effects of staphylokinase may be downregulated at the site of vascular occlusion."

We prospectively investigated AT in consecutive women admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of PE, to assess if AT fluctuations could be associated with the evolution of the disease. AT, platelet count and D-dimer levels were determined every other day. In the 73 patients studied, AT, platelet count and fibrinogen progressively reduced during the observational period, reaching a nadir on the day of delivery, whereas D-dimer progressively increased over time. Statistical analysis was restricted to the 39 women that had an AT measurement performed on each of days -1, 0 and +1, with respect to the day of delivery. These subjects showed a significant decrease in AT on the day of delivery compared to the day just before (77.8 +/- 15.1%vs. 85.4 +/- 14.2%, P = 0.027), followed by a recovery on the first day after delivery (87.6 +/- 21.3% from 77.8 +/- 15.1%, P = 0.005).

CD010864,0,18561913,0,Antitumor effects of Isatin on human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) and the related mechanism.,"The purpose of the study was to investigate the antitumor effects of Isatin and the related mechanism. Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were exposed to Isatin at different concentrations for 48 h. Apoptotic features were demonstrated by means of nuclei staining with Hoechst 33258 and flow cytometry with propidium iodide (PI). Expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA were analyzed via RT-PCR. Expressions of Bcl-2, Bax proteins and phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated protein kinases (ERKs, p42/p44) were analyzed via Western blot. Activation of caspase-3 was assayed by flow cytometry with anti-active caspase-3-McAb-PE. VEGF protein was determined by ELISA kits. And the results showed that apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells were induced by Isatin in a dose-dependent manner. Expressions of Bcl-2, VEGF mRNA and Bcl-2, VEGF proteins were down-regulated, while expressions of Bax mRNA and Bax protein were not changed obviously. Expression of phosphorylated ERKs decreased, but the level of activated caspase-3 increased after treatment of Isatin. These results suggest that Isatin promotes the apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells, therefore, it might be a potential candidate for the treatment of neuroblastoma."
CD010864,0,22247055,0,Duration of anticoagulation after venous thrombosis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a multicausal disease which tends to recur. Recurrence can be prevented by anticoagulant treatment albeit at the cost of bleeding. Deciding on the optimal duration of anticoagulation is based on balancing the risk of recurrence and of bleeding in case anticoagulation is continued. Patients with VTE provoked by a transient risk factor have a low risk of recurrence and stopping anticoagulation after 3 months is recommended because the risk of bleeding likely outweighs the risk of recurrence. In patients with unprovoked VTE recurrence is high and indefinite anticoagulation should be considered. However, the majority of these patients will not suffer recurrence but thus far safe identification of low or high patients risk is not possible. Despite considerable advances in the identification of new risk factors for (recurrent) VTE, predicting the risk of recurrence in an individual patient remains a challenge. Measuring D-Dimer as a global coagulation markers and the use of prediction models that integrate clinical characteristics and laboratory markers are the most promising approaches to improve risk assessment and to optimize the duration of anticoagulation. New oral anticoagulants have been studied for treatment of patients with VTE. However, more data on the bleeding risk during extended thromboprophylaxis are needed to decide which patients may indeed benefit from these novel agents."

The aim of this study was to investigate the possible causal association of PIH with maternal serum PAPP-A and urinary protein-creatinine ratio (UPCr) as well as to evaluate the usefulness of these two variables as predictive markers of PIH. A total 200 women of 8-16 weeks of pregnancy were enrolled in this study. All the patients were followed up till delivery for the development of pregnancy induced hypertension. Thirty patients were lost in the follow up, 3(1.76%) developed preeclampsia (PE) and 14(8.23%) gestational hypertension (GH). By a nested case-control design the 17 pregnancy induced hypertension cases were compared with 48 Controls with normal pregnancy outcome. Maternal serum PAPP-A was significantly lower in the pregnancy induced hypertension group compared to Control [mIU/ml, median (range) 1.8(0.70-4.1) vs. 5.45(2.7-10), p<0.001]. UPCr was significantly higher in the pregnancy induced hypertension group compared to Control (mg/mmol, mean+/-SD, 6.86+/-1.56 vs. 4.75+/-0.96, p<0.001). When tested as a predictive marker of pregnancy induced hypertension the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of maternal serum PAPP-A in the lowest 25th percentile were 82%, 95%, 87% and 93%. At 75th percentile the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of UPCr were 52%, 85%, 56% and 83% respectively."
CD010864,0,18256058,0,Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein for risk assessment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.,"Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) is a reliable marker of myocardial injury and was recently identified as a predictor of outcome in acute pulmonary embolism. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of H-FABP in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). In total, 93 consecutive patients with CTEPH were studied. During long-term follow-up (median duration 1,260 days, interquartile range (IQR) 708-2,460 days), 46 (49%) patients had an adverse outcome, defined as CTEPH-related death, lung transplantation or persistent pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA). Baseline H-FABP levels in plasma ranged from 0.69-24.3 ng x mL(-1) (median (IQR) 3.41 (2.28-4.86) ng x mL(-1)). Cox regression analysis revealed a hazard ratio of 1.10 (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.18) for each increase of H-FABP by 1 ng x mL(-1), and continuous elevations of H-FABP emerged as an independent predictor of adverse outcome by multivariable analysis. PEA was performed in 52 patients and favourably affected the long-term outcome. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with baseline H-FABP concentrations >2.7 ng x mL(-1), the median value of the biomarker in the surgically treated population, had a lower probability of event-free survival after PEA. Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein is a promising novel biomarker for risk stratification of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension."

CD010864,0,15794972,0,Deep vein thrombosis.,"Deep vein thrombosis and its sequelae pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome are some of the most common disorders. A thrombus either arises spontaneously or is caused by clinical conditions including surgery, trauma, or prolonged bed rest. In these instances, prophylaxis with low-dose anticoagulation is effective. Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis relies on imaging techniques such as ultrasonography or venography. Only about 25% of symptomatic patients have a thrombus. Thus, clinical risk assessment and D-dimer measurement are used to rule out deep vein thrombosis. Thrombus progression and embolisation can be prevented by low-molecular-weight heparin followed by vitamin K antagonists. Use of these antagonists for 3-6 months is sufficient for many patients. Those with antithrombin deficiency, the lupus anticoagulant, homozygous or combined defects, or with previous deep vein thrombosis can benefit from indefinite anticoagulation. In cancer patients, low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective than and is at least as safe as vitamin K antagonists. Women seem to have a lower thrombosis risk than men, but pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy represent important risk factors."
CD010864,0,16877563,0,Estrus cycle: influence on cardiac function following trauma-hemorrhage.,"Since cardiac function is depressed in males but not in proestrus (PE) females following trauma-hemorrhage (T-H), we examined whether different estrus cycles influence cardiac function in female rats under those conditions. We hypothesized that females in the PE cycle only will have normal cardiac function following T-H and resuscitation. Sham operation or T-H was performed in five groups of rats (250-275 g) including PE, estrus (E), metestrus (ME), diestrus (DE), and ovariectomized (OVX) females (n = 6-7 per group). Cardiac function was determined 2 h after T-H, following which cardiomyocytes were isolated and nuclei extracted. Cardiomyocyte IL-6 and NF-kappaB expressions were measured using Western blotting. Moreover, plasma IL-6, estradiol, and progesterone levels were measured using ELISA or EIA kits. Results (1-way ANOVA) indicated that following T-H, 1) cardiac function was depressed in DE, E, ME, and OVX groups but maintained in the PE group; 2) the PE group had the highest plasma estrogen level; 3) plasma IL-6 levels increased significantly in DE, E, ME, and OVX groups, but the increase was attenuated in the PE group; 4) cardiomyocyte IL-6 protein level increased significantly in DE, E, ME and OVX groups after TH, but the increase was attenuated in the PE group; and 5) cardiomyocyte NF-kappaB expression increased significantly but was attenuated in the PE group. These data collectively suggest that the estrus cycle plays an important role in cardiac function following TH. The salutary effect seen in PE following TH is likely due to a decrease in NF-kappaB-dependent cardiac IL-6 pathway."

CD010864,0,20517184,0,Spinal cord sarcoidosis: clinical and laboratory profile and outcome of 31 patients in a case-control study.,"Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disorder of unknown cause that affects the spinal cord in fewer than 1% of patients who suffer from it. We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 31 patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis and compared them to 30 patients with myelopathies of other causes to analyze their clinical, laboratory, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) profiles and to assess their long-term prognoses. Thirty-one patients presented with clinical signs of myelopathy and were diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Twenty-two of these patients had biopsy-proven noncaseating granulomas. In 9 patients, sarcoidosis involved only a neurologic localization. Patients in the control group were mainly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or optic neuromyelitis. Patients with sarcoidosis were more likely to have elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hypergammaglobulinemia in serum, as well as a higher protein content and white blood cell count in cerebrospinal fluid. Spinal cord MRIs performed in 26 patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis revealed T2-hyperintensities that were extensive and heterogeneous with a central distribution in axial slides. Twenty-six patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis presented neurologic sequelae after follow-up (mean, 64 +/- 8 mo), although 2 patients completely recovered. Neurologic sequelae correlated with cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell counts. One-third of the patients had a monophasic course of the disease, another third had a relapsing-remitting course, and the remaining third had a progressive course. Four patients had pulmonary embolism during follow-up. Spinal cord sarcoidosis remains a diagnostic dilemma since neurologic localization is frequently the only manifestation. Because treatment for spinal cord sarcoidosis is far different from treatment for other myelopathies, such as multiple sclerosis and optic neuromyelitis, diagnosis of sarcoidosis remains an important challenge. Here, we show that spinal cord MRI and blood and cerebrospinal markers may be useful tools in the diagnosis of spinal cord sarcoidosis. We suggest that accessory salivary gland biopsies, chest X-rays, protein electrophoresis, and blood levels of CRP and LDH should be obtained for each patient with subacute myelopathy. We also recommend paying careful attention to thromboembolism in patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis because of systemic disease and their decreased mobility."
CD010864,0,19898789,0,[Diagnostic assessment of perioperative thromboembolism].,Venous thromboembolism (VTE) including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is a frequent complication in postoperative setting. Despite advances in the diagnostic options conformation or exclusion of VTE remains a challenge. Preoperative assessment of thromboembolic risk factors may be helpful in estimating postoperative thromboembolic risk. Laboratory markers such as D-Dimer provide only limited information as they are modified by surgical intervention. Venous ultrasonography seems in postoperative setting a wide applicable diagnostic tool. However limited interpretation may be caused by bandage or oedema. Contrast venography und CT pulmonary angiography may be limited due to the nephrotoxic side effects of contrast agents especially in multimorbid patients. The development in magnetic resonance technology may overwhelm such problems. However magnetic implantates may also limit this modern diagnostic tool.

CD010864,0,21573936,0,Lipid rafts and cytoskeletal proteins in placental microvilli membranes from preeclamptic and IUGR pregnancies.,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preeclampsia (PE) are leading causes of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Previously we reported the expression of lipid rafts in classical microvillous membrane (MVM) and light microvillous membrane (LMVM), two subdomains in apical membrane from the human placental syncytiotrophoblast (hSTB), which constitute the epithelium responsible for maternal-fetal transport. Here the aim was to study the raft and cytoskeletal proteins from PE and IUGR. Microdomains from MVM and LMVM were tested with raft markers (placental alkaline phosphatase, lipid ganglioside, and annexin 2) and a nonraft marker (hTf-R). No changes were detected with those markers in whole purified apical membranes in normal, PE, and IUGR pregnancies; however, their patterns of distribution in lipid rafts were different in PE and IUGR. Cholesterol depletion modified their segregation, confirming their presence in lipid rafts, although unlike normal placenta, in these pathologies there is only one type of microdomain. Additionally, the cytoskeleton proteins actin, ezrin, and cytokeratin-7 showed clear differences between normal and pathological membranes. Cytokeratin-7 expression decreased to 50% in PE, and the distribution between LMVM and MVM (~43 and 57%, respectively) changed in both PE and IUGR, in contrast with the asymmetrical enrichment obtained in normal LMVM (~62%). In conclusion, lipid rafts from IUGR and PE have different features compared to rafts from normal placentae, and this is associated with alterations in the expression and distribution of cytoskeletal proteins."

Adjuvants tested included CFA, aluminum hydroxide (alum), a lipophilic derivative of muramyl tripeptide (MTP-PE), and a muramyl dipeptide (MDP) covalently conjugated to rgD1. Animals were immunized three times with rgD1 plus the various adjuvants and antibody titers were determined by ELISA. Four weeks after the last immunization, the animals were challenged intravaginally with HSV type 2 and were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease, including frequency and severity of herpetic lesions, incidence of urinary retention, and mortality during the 14-day post-challenge observation period. Animals immunized in the foot-pad with rgD1 formulated with CFA showed the highest antibody titers. Animals immunized in the footpad with rgD1 using MTP-PE in a 4% squalene formulation, alum, or rgD1 conjugated to MDP showed mean antibody titers that were 57, 16, and 13% of the CFA titers, respectively. Immunization with rgD1 plus MTP-PE, alum, or rgD1-MDP conjugate by the i.m. route elicited lower antibody titers than the footpad route of immunization. Results of the viral challenge indicated that clinical symptoms of the groups immunized with rgD1 with CFA or MTP-PE as adjuvant were similar in magnitude and were markedly reduced compared with unimmunized control groups. Animals immunized with rgD1 combined with alum or rgD1-MDP conjugate showed clinical symptoms significantly more severe than the CFA or MTP-PE groups. The protective immunity observed after i.m. immunization of animals with rgD1 and MTP-PE was only slightly lower than animals immunized with the same Ag-adjuvant combination in the footpad. The results indicate that MTP-PE is an effective adjuvant for the recombinant herpes gD vaccine."
CD010864,0,20581221,0,Increased lymphocyte micronucleus frequency in early pregnancy is associated prospectively with pre-eclampsia and/or intrauterine growth restriction.,"Genome stability is essential for normal foetal growth and development. To date, genome stability in human lymphocytes has not been studied in relation to late pregnancy diseases, such as pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which can be life-threatening to mother and baby and together affect >10% of pregnancies. We performed a prospective cohort study investigating the association of maternal chromosomal damage in mid-pregnancy (20 weeks gestation) with pregnancy outcomes. Chromosome damage was measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMNcyt) assay in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The odds ratio for PE and/or IUGR in a mixed cohort of low- and high-risk pregnancies (N = 136) and a cohort of only high-risk pregnancies (N = 91) was 15.97 (P = 0.001) and 17.85 (P = 0.007), respectively, if the frequency of lymphocytes with micronuclei (MN) at 20 weeks gestation was greater than the mean + 2 SDs of the cohort. These results suggest that the presence of lymphocyte MN is significantly increased in women who develop PE and/or IUGR before the clinical signs or symptoms appear relative to women with normal pregnancy outcomes. The CBMNcyt assay may provide a new approach for the early detection of women at risk of developing these late pregnancy diseases and for biomonitoring the efficacy of interventions to reduce DNA damage, which may in turn ameliorate pregnancy outcome."

Superoxide anion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release were determined by specific assays, and cytokine levels were determined by immunoenzymatic assays (ELISA). Monocytes from preeclamptic women cultured without stimulus released higher levels of O22, H2O2 and TNF-Î±, and lower levels of IL-10 and TGF-Î²1 than did monocytes from NT and NP women. Treatment in vitro with silibinin significantly inhibited spontaneous O2- and H2O2 release and TNF-Î± production by monocytes from preeclamptic women. The main effect of silibinin was obtained at 50 Î¼M concentration. Thus, silibinin exerts anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects on monocytes from preeclamptic pregnant women by inhibiting the in vitro endogenous release of reactive oxygen species and TNF-Î± production."

CD010864,0,21180223,0,Deep vein thrombosis in protein S deficiency.,"Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein. It functions as a cofactor of activated protein C to inactivate activated factor V (FVa) and activated factor VIII (FVIIIa). Its deficiency is a rare condition and can lead to deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or stroke. It is often treated with long-term anti-coagulant therapy. Protein S deficiency may be hereditary or acquired; the latter is usually due to hepatic diseases or a vitamin K deficiency. Protein S deficiency manifests as an autosomal dominant trait; manifestations of thrombosis are observed in both heterozygous and homozygous genetic deficiencies of protein S. This case report is of DVT due to Protein S deficiency in a 53 year old male. Venous Doppler was used to diagnose DVT and free Protein S level measured by ELISA.

CD010864,0,1723302,0,Monoclonal antibodies to different neo-epitopes on fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products.,"The measurement of fibrin or fibrinogen degradation products is widely used in clinical practice for the diagnosis and follow up of coagulolytic disturbances. Recently D-dimer assays have become very popular owing to their direct application to plasma. However, in some clinical situations there is a need to differentiate fibrin from fibrinogen degradation products. These are still routinely measured by conventional assays on serum. We tried to develop various monoclonal antibodies specific for the neo-epitopes unmasked during the degradation of fibrin or fibrinogen. Fifteen mice hybridomas producing the expected antibodies were obtained and ten were extensively characterized. They could be classified in three reactivity classes: D and D-dimer, D-dimer and early fibrinogen or fibrin degradation products. These monoclonal antibodies were used to develop latex slide assays and ELISA techniques. Two types of assays were obtained; those which were specific for fibrin-related products and those evaluating the totality of fibrin or fibrinogen degradation products. Assays discriminating the fibrinogen split products from those derived from fibrin, and performed directly on citrated plasma can be proposed. They provide complementary information in clinical states such as DIC, pulmonary embolism, leukaemias, thrombolysis, etc."

We detected the SMRP levels in pleural effusions (PE) by means of an ELISA and analyzed their diagnostic relevance to differentiate MPM from benign pathology and from non-MPM pleural metastasis. Comparison with cytology in MPM-PE was also performed. We found that SMRP detection in MPM-PE can help the diagnosis of MPM and provide additional diagnostic value to cytology. We concluded that SMRP test may be incorporated into clinical practice of PE from patients suspicious for MPM.
CD010864,0,8578842,0,Enhancement of humoral response against human influenza vaccine with the simple submicron oil/water emulsion adjuvant MF59.,"Human influenza subunit vaccines are not fully protective in either the very young or elderly populations where risk is greatest. The use of an adjuvant to enhance antibody titer is an attractive option to increase vaccine efficacy. A series of squalene/H2O emulsions stabilized either by the amphipathic muramyl peptide MTP-PE (sodium N-acetyl-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanyl-2-(1',2'-dipalmitoyl- sn- glycero-3'phospho) ethylamide) or by mixtures of the sorbitan oleate surfactants Tween 80 and Span 85 have been tested as adjuvants with influenza vaccine. Combination of influenza vaccine with the Tween/Span stabilized emulsions has resulted in significantly higher antibody titers to vaccine in an extensive series of naive animal models. The use of submicron emulsion droplets is significant in determination of adjuvant activity while the presence of the muramyl peptide is not required for adjuvant activity. The 200-300 nm diameter emulsion formulation MF59 containing only the low toxicity components squalene, Tween 80 and Span 85 has been shown to enhance titers from 5 to 250 times that achievable with vaccine alone."

A distinct CDS IIF pattern represented by 3-20 discrete speckles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm was identified among other cytoplasmic speckled IIF patterns. The cytoplasmic domains labelled by human anti-CDS-1 antibodies did not co-localize with endosome/lysosome markers EEA1 and LAMP-2, but showed partial co-localization with glycine-tryptophan bodies (GWB). CDS-1 sera did not react with several cellular extracts in immunoblotting and did not immunoprecipitate recombinant GW182 or EEA1 proteins. The typical CDS-1 IIF labelling pattern was abolished after delipidation of HEp-2 cells. Moreover, CDS-1 sera reacted strongly with a lipid component co-migrating with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC)-immunostaining of HEp-2 cell total lipid extracts. The CDS-1 major molecular targets were established by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), HPTLC-immunostaining and chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as diacyl-PE species, containing preferentially a cis-C18 : 1 fatty acid chain at C-2 of the glycerol moiety, namely 1,2-cis-C18 : 1-PE and 1-C16 : 0-2-cis-C18 : 1-PE.

CD010864,0,785689,0,Streptokinase and urokinase in the treatment of pulmonary thromboemboli; from a national cooperative study.,"In Phase I of this study of 160 patients with pulmonary embolism, it was demonstrated that of 12 hours of urokinase accelerated the resolution of pulmonary thromboemboli compared to heparin alone. Phase II compared 12 hours of urokinase, 24 hours of urokinase and 24 hours of streptokinase in 167 patients. All patients had a clinical history and angiographic diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment. All physicians making patient observations were unaware of drug assignment. Resolution of the thromboembolism 24-30 hours after therapy had been instituted was determined by pulmonary angiography, lung perfusion scans and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. Twenty-four hours of urokinase did not demonstrate greater clot resolution than 12 hours of urokinase. Twenty-four hours of urokinase resulted in greater improvement than streptokinase in lung perfusion scans, but not in angiograms. In patients with massive embolism, this difference was statistically significant. Hemodynamic differences varied. Bleeding complications and morbidity due to allergic reactions with streptokinase and urokinase were minimal. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality in the three threatment groups. From the Phase I and Phase II data it is reasonable to conclude that all three regimens of thrombolytic therapy are more effective than heparin alone in accelerating resolution of pulmonary emboli. Thrombolytic therapy offers the clinician an alternative to pulmonary embolectomy."

CD010864,0,14962817,0,Single photon emission computed tomography of pulmonary emboli and venous thrombi using anti-D-dimer.,"Previous attempts to diagnose thromboemboli using radiolabeled antibodies and nuclear medicine imaging have been disappointing. We present the results of experiments with intravenous technetium-99m-labeled deimmunized antifibrin Fab' fragments to diagnose thromboemboli using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a highly sensitive scintigraphic imaging technique. Pulmonary emboli (PEs) and lower extremity deep vein thrombi (DVTs) were formed in five dogs, then technetium-99m-labeled Fab' ( approximately 400 mg, approximately 260 MBq) were injected via forelimb veins. Thoracic and lower extremity SPECT scans were performed at 2-hour intervals after antibody infusion to visualize the thromboemboli. Four hours after antibody infusion, all PEs and DVTs of mass 0.4 g or greater were clearly visualized on SPECT scans as 'hot spots' within the lungs and legs, respectively. PEs (0.48 +/- 0.09 g) were intensely radiolabeled, yielding clot/blood radioactivity ratios of 22.8 +/- 5.6. DVTs (0.45 +/- 0.31 g) also had high clot/blood ratios (11.7 +/- 2.6). Infusion of these radiolabeled antibody fragments, combined with SPECT, produces clear images of PEs and DVTs within a clinically feasible time frame. The technique reliably identified even peripheral thromboemboli of relatively small size, which are difficult to diagnose with currently available imaging techniques, and may enable imaging of PEs, DVTs, or both in the same patient."
CD010864,0,17323033,0,[Diagnosis and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism].,"Only in one fourth to one third of patients admitted for suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is PE objectively confirmed, implying that symptoms and clinical findings of acute PE are nonspecific. Clinical pretest probability for PE may be estimated on the basis of validated clinical scores. A low clinical pretest probability and a negative D-dimer value allow exclusion of PE without further imaging procedure. Among imaging techniques, multislice CT scanning has become the preferred method to visualize PE. Alternatively, a combination of clinical pretest probability, D-dimer value and a perfusion/ventilation scan may be performed. The majority of patients presenting with acute segmental or subsegmental PE are hemodynamically stable. Right ventricular function may, however, be disturbed, and an echocardiography should be performed, therefore. Anticoagulation initiated with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparins or with the pentasaccharide fondaparinux overlapping with oral anticoagulation using vitamin K antagonists is the standard therapy for hemodynamically stable patients without major right ventricular dysfunction. A transthoracic echocardiography should be performed without delay in patients with suspected central PE and a positive shock index of > or = 1.0 to determine right ventricular function. When major right ventricular dysfunction is found due to central massive PE, immediate performance of surgical or catheter-guided embolectomy or thrombolysis should be considered."

Human monocytic leukemia cells were differentiated under standard conditions with vitamin D3 and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. Cells were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell-sorter Scan of CD 14 expression analysis as well as a phagocytosis test exploiting fluorescence-labeled particles of bacteria] walls. To achieve a relevant contact between the floating PE particles (approximately 1 microm in size) and MLC, a rotation device was used (15 rotations/min) during incubation. The same was done with the titanium particles. Cell culture supernatants were then analyzed for interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique in the absence or presence of particles. Rotation of incubated MLC alone did not influence the secretion of TNF-alpha, but it enhanced secretion of IL-1beta and IL-8 about 30-fold compared to background levels. Both PE and titanium particles significantly enhanced MLC cytokine release, the amount of which depended on the concentration of particles. Using 40 X 10(8) PE particles (0.7 x 10(8) titanium particles) and 10(6) MLC, the maximal release of IL-1beta was about 20-fold (7-fold titanium particles) higher than that of the rotating control sample. The stimulation of IL-8 release was 4-fold (3-fold titanium particles) and of TNF-alpha. 300-fold (170-fold titanium particles) compared to controls. MLC were viable (>90% cell survival) at concentrations less than 108 x 10(8) polyethylene particles per 10(6) MLC and 16 x 10(8) titanium particles per 10(6) MLC. Rotation per se as well as exposure to increasing concentrations of PE and titanium particles stimulates cytokine release (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-8) by macrophages in vitro. This in vitro model resembles the in vivo situation near arthroplasties, where implant particles make contact with inflammatory cells, such as macrophages. Cytokine release by macrophages may impair osteoblast function as well as stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts and macrophages, thereby causing aseptic loosening of arthroplasties. Our in vitro model provides a reproducible human cell system that might shed light on the pathogenesis of particle disease and might serve as a reproducible in vitro test system for the biocompatibility of foreign materials."
CD010864,0,16635617,0,Usefulness of bedside testing for brain natriuretic peptide to identify right ventricular dysfunction and outcome in normotensive patients with acute pulmonary embolism.,"Echocardiographic right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a well-established prognostic indicator in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. However, the possibility of implementing a rapid and effective triage with biohumoral markers such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) may be of value. Sixty-one patients with a first documented episode of acute pulmonary embolism without shock and previous left ventricular dysfunction were prospectively studied. All patients underwent echocardiography and rapid BNP testing on admission. Patients were followed up for in-hospital death, progression to shock, and nonfatal pulmonary embolism recurrence. Overall, 35 patients (57%) had echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction on admission, and its prevalence increased progressively with increasing levels of BNP. A BNP level <85 pg/ml was highly accurate in excluding RV dysfunction. No patient in the lower tertile of BNP values (1.1 to 85.0 pg/ml) had RV dysfunction, compared with 75% in the middle tertile (88.7 to 487.0 pg/ml) and 100% in the upper tertile (527 to 1,300 pg/ml). Overall, 11 patients (18%), belonging to the upper tertile, progressed to shock during admission, 4 of whom died. The association of RV dysfunction with a BNP level in the upper tertile (>or=527 pg/ml) showed incremental prognostic value over RV dysfunction alone (in-hospital death and progression to shock were 55% and 31%, respectively). In the present study, BNP represented a powerful predictor of in-hospital clinical deterioration, with substantial incremental prognostic value over echocardiography alone."

Fifteen patients received heparin alone (group A), 5 cases were treated with 7.7 x 10(6) I.U. of tPA (group B) and 10 cases with 15 x 10(6) I.U. of tPA (group C) combined with heparin treatment. Arterial oxygen tension before treatment was not significantly different among the three groups. PaO2 was dramatically improved on the 1st day in group C. By the 7th day, PaO2 of group B had improved to the level of group C. However, the PaO2 of group A on the 7th day was not significantly different compared to the pre-treatment value. In group C, post-treatment perfusion lung scintigrams were improved compared to the pre-treatment images, but this was not the case in group B. Treatment with tPA is more effective for acute pulmonary thromboembolism than heparin alone and a high dose of tPA (15 x 10(6) I.U.) leads to rapid improvement in arterial blood gases and lung perfusion images."
CD010864,0,11877267,0,Randomized trial of different regimens of heparins and in vivo thrombin generation in acute deep vein thrombosis.,"Low-molecular-weight and unfractionated heparins are frequently used to treat venous thromboembolism, but it is not known whether they are equally effective in inhibiting in vivo generation of thrombin. In this multicenter trial, 1048 patients were randomized to intravenous unfractionated heparin (group A), twice daily low-molecular-weight heparin (reviparin) for 1 week (group B), or once daily reviparin for 4 weeks (group C). All patients received vitamin K antagonists. Blood samples withdrawn at the baseline and at weeks 1 and 3 were analyzed using markers of in vivo thrombin generation and other coagulation parameters. During the first 3 weeks symptomatic recurrent deep vein thrombosis-pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) occurred in 17 (4.5%) of 375 patients in group A compared with 4 (1.0%) of 388 patients in group B, and 9 (2.4%) of 374 patients in group C. Forty percent of patients in group A, 53.4% in group B, and 53.5% in group C showed 30% or greater reduction in thrombus size assessed by venography. Patients in group B had significantly greater reduction in D-dimer, prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (F1 + 2), endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes compared to groups A and C. Greater release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and reduction in levels of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and fibrinogen were significantly more pronounced in group C patients. Reviparin administered twice daily plus vitamin K antagonist is more effective in inhibiting in vivo thrombin generation compared to intravenous unfractionated heparin plus vitamin K antagonist, and reviparin once daily produced significantly higher TFPI release and greater reduction in TAFI and fibrinogen levels."
CD010864,0,1964663,0,Therapeutic application of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin in acute venous thrombosis.,"Fifty patients presenting with acute deep-vein thrombosis were randomized in a prospective, controlled study to determine the safety and efficacy of a treatment with low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin compared with unfractionated heparin. LMW heparin (n = 24) was administered twice daily subcutaneously at a dose of 2 X 150 anti-Xa units/kg body weight, and unfractionated heparin (n = 26) was given intravenously by continuous infusion at a dose of 450 anti-Xa units/kg body weight daily for 10 days. Doses were adjusted to maintain peak anti-Xa levels between 0.5 and 1.0 anti-Xa units per milliliter. One patient in the unfractionated heparin group and 2 patients in the LMW heparin group suffered from bleeding complications. Two patients on LMW heparin and on unfractionated heparin had high evidence of pulmonary embolism based on defects on ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy. Control phlebography and duplex sonography demonstrated a significant improvement during both treatment regimens. Reperfusion of the deep-vein system was 70% with LMW heparin and 75% with unfractionated heparin. The anti-Xa levels were significantly higher in the LMW heparin group, and activated partial thromboplastin and thrombin clotting times were significantly higher in the group receiving unfractionated heparin. Thrombin-antithrombin III complexes and D-dimer concentration decreased during the treatment, but did not differ between the two regimens. At the end of the treatment period with LMW heparin, protein C and antithrombin III were significantly higher."

The etiology of PE is unclear but oxidative stress seems to play a major role in endothelial dysfunction and permanent systemic vasoconstriction shown in PE. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), a terminal metabolite of the cellular oxidative stress cascade, is also revealed as a component of oxidative ischemia/reperfusion stress in placenta. We were the first to show an increase in the levels of H(2)O(2) in the serum of preeclamptic women at term. H(2)O(2) is already known to reduce the production of NO by increasing the metabolism of arginases. The objective of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, and H(2)O(2) throughout pregnancy. Thus, we simultaneously assessed the levels of NO and H(2)O(2) in the serum of normal and preeclamptic women at 10-15 and 37-40 weeks of pregnancy, and in placentas at delivery. Our findings showed an inverse correlation between increased levels of H(2)O(2) and decreased levels of NO early in maternal circulation and at term in placenta. This relationship is confirmed by our in vitro experiments which demonstrate that H(2)O(2) inhibits NO synthesis of cytotrophoblasts. In conclusion, our findings highlight an inverse correlation between H(2)O(2) and NO early in maternal circulation and in placenta of women with preeclampsia, paving the way for further studies examining the potential use of NO and H(2)O(2) as biomarkers in the prediction of preeclampsia."

To determine levels of cardiopulmonary biomarkers in canine dirofilariasis, measurements of cardiac troponin T, cardiac troponin I, myoglobin, and D-dimer concentrations were performed for dogs with and without evidence of adult heartworm infection. The results showed that levels of cardiac troponin T were undetectable in all dogs studied while levels of cardiac troponin I were higher in dogs infected with Dirofilaria immitis. In healthy dogs, levels of myoglobin and D-dimer were below detection limits of the instrument and were significantly higher in heartworm-infected dogs, notably in microfilaremic dogs. The results suggest the possibility of using troponin I and myoglobin as markers for cardiac damage and the D-dimer as a supportive tool for a diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs with cardiopulmonary dirofilariasis."
CD010864,0,19762080,0,The expression of connective tissue growth factor in pregnancies complicated by severe preeclampsia or fetal growth restriction.,"We tested the hypothesis that the expression of placental connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is enhanced in pregnancies complicated by severe preeclampsia (PE) or fetal growth restriction (FGR). CTGF expression was analyzed using immunostaining, western blot and real-time quantitative PCR in placental samples obtained after third trimester cesarean deliveries without labor from women with severe PE (n=11), idiopathic FGR (n=14), or healthy controls (n=14). Serum CTGF concentrations were analyzed using ELISA. We found that CTGF was stably expressed in villous trophoblasts throughout pregnancy. The expression of CTGF mRNA in placentas from severe PE or FGR was higher than placentas from controls. Whereas the levels of placental CTGF protein were similar between normal and severe PE, maternal and fetal serum CTGF levels were elevated in severe PE. Maternal CTGF levels were also distinctively elevated in women with PE or FGR with histological evidence of placental injury. The enhancement of CTGF expression as well as serum CTGF levels in clinical conditions attributed to placental dysfunction suggests a role for this secretary protein in the pathophysiology of placental injury or its sequelae."

In this study, we measured the periapical exudate (PE) levels of IL-1 beta and IL-1ra from human periapical lesions. PE samples were collected from root canals during routine endodontic treatments, and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure PE-IL-1 beta and IL-1ra. Detectable levels of both IL-1 beta and IL-1ra were found in 25 of 29 clinical samples. Relatively high levels of IL-1ra compared with IL-1 beta (mean IL-1ra:IL-1 beta ratio = 128:7; range: 0.9 to 495.4), and significantly positive correlation between IL-1ra and IL-1 beta levels was found. The PE-IL-1ra:IL-1 beta ratios obtained from symptomatic lesions were significantly lower than those from asymptomatic lesions. These results suggest that IL-1ra-mediated IL-1 antagonism occurred to block locally produced IL-1 activity, and the balance of IL-1 to IL-1ra production may be crucial in the development of periapical lesions."

CD010864,0,7587743,0,Peripheral blood cell preparation influences the level of expression of leukocyte cell surface markers as assessed with quantitative multicolor flow cytometry.,"We have compared the influence of sample preparation upon the level of surface expression of T, B, and NK cell-related antigens as assessed by flow cytometry. Lysed whole blood (WBL), Ficoll-Paque separated peripheral blood lymphocyte (F-PBL), and frozen peripheral blood lymphocyte (Fr-PBL) were analyzed via single- and multicolor flow cytometry. The percentage of positive cells expressing the individual cell surface markers was not affected by the procedure for preparation of WBL, F-PBL, and Fr-PBL. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity level of individual cell surface markers varied depending on cell preparation. By using Quantum Simply Cellular (QSC) microbeads, the antibody binding capacity (ABC) of single-color stained cells was quantified and compared. The amount of monoclonal antibody (MAb) anti-CD3-FITC bound to Fr-PBL (mean ABC = 137,040) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) that the amounts bound to WBL (mean ABC = 112,410) and F-PBL (mean ABC = 107,738). In multicolor analysis, the fluorescence intensity of CD3-FITC and CD4-FITC was significantly higher on Fr-PBL than on WBL and F-PBL; CD8-PE and CD20-PerCP was significantly higher on WBL. Furthermore, the intensity of CD3 and CD4 was different on T-cell subsets. The intensity of CD3 staining in three-color analysis was lower than with single-color staining using the same fluorochrome. We conclude that particularly the method of cell preparation but also the selection of MAb combinations may influence the level of staining of certain lymphocyte antigens. This may be of relevance in the analysis of cellular activation and regulation of differentiation."

CD010864,0,1376612,0,Localization of endoderm-specific mRNAs in differentiating F9 embryoid bodies.,"Primitive endoderm in the peri-implantation mouse embryo differentiates into two separate lineages, visceral and parietal endoderm (VE and PE). F9 teratocarcinoma cells, when grown in suspension in the presence of retinoic acid (RA), differentiate into embryoid bodies (EBs) which can be used as a model system to study the spatially appropriate induction of VE- and PE-specific gene expression. We have used a whole mount in situ hybridization technique to follow the localization of VE-specific AFP and PE-specific tPA mRNAs during EB differentiation. We show that the putative endoderm-specific markers are localized to the endoderm in mature EBs, and that AFP mRNA is localized to the apical edge of the VE in RA EBs. Surprisingly, prior to localization of endoderm-specific markers at the periphery of EBs, these genes are expressed at low to moderate levels in all cells of the EB. Our data suggest that the establishment of endoderm in EBs is position dependent and not the result of sorting out of predetermined, randomly distributed cells. Our observations also suggest a two-step process for establishing endoderm-specific gene expression, involving up-regulation of transcripts throughout the EB prior to the restriction of their expression to the outer differentiating cell layer."
CD010864,0,7554626,0,The John Charnley Award. Thrombogenesis during total hip arthroplasty.,"The activation of the clotting cascade leading to deep venous thrombosis begins during total hip arthroplasty, but few studies have assessed changes in coagulation during surgery. A better understanding of thrombogenesis during total hip arthroplasty may provide a more rational basis for treatment. In 3 separate studies, the following observations were made. Circulating indices of thrombosis and fibrinolysis: prothrombin F1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, fibrinopeptide A, and D-dimer, did not increase during osteotomy of the neck of the femur or during insertion of the acetabular component, but rose significantly during insertion of the femoral component. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes, fibrinopeptide A, and D-dimer were higher after insertion of a cemented component than insertion of a noncemented femoral component. A significant decline in central venous oxygen tension was observed after relocation of the hip joint and after insertions of cemented and noncemented femoral components, providing evidence of femoral venous occlusion during insertion of the femoral component. In patients receiving a cemented femoral component, mean pulmonary artery pressure increased after relocation of the hip joint, indicating intraoperative pulmonary embolism. No changes in mean pulmonary artery pressure were noted with noncemented total hip arthroplasty. Administration of 1000 units of unfractionated heparin before insertion of a cemented femoral component blunted the rise of fibrinopeptide A. The results of these studies suggest that (1) the greatest risk of activation of the clotting cascade during total hip arthroplasty occurs during insertion of the femoral component; (2) femoral venous occlusion and use of cemented components are factors in thrombogenesis during total hip arthroplasty; and (3) measures to prevent deep venous thrombosis during total hip arthroplasty (such as intraoperative anticoagulation) should begin during surgery rather than during the postoperative period and be applied during insertion of the femoral component."
CD010864,0,1507298,0,D-dimer levels correlate with pathologic thrombosis in trauma patients.,"Pathologic thrombosis, in the form of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), causes significant morbidity and mortality in trauma patients and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge because of associated conditions in these patients. This study examines the measurement of D-dimer crosslinked fibrin degradation products (D-dimer XDPs) as an indicator of hypercoagulability that places a trauma patient at risk of developing pathologic thrombosis. The time course of changes in D-dimer values after trauma normally involves an initial increase with a rapid decrease of D-dimer XDP levels to normal. Patients who then demonstrate a second rise in D-dimer values are at risk for pathologic thrombosis. Forty-one trauma patients were studied, in two groups, to evaluate the potential use of D-dimer XDP levels in evaluating the risk of pathologic thrombosis. A secondary increase in D-dimer XDP levels was found to occur in patients with PE, although sepsis and adult respiratory distress syndrome can also cause a late increase. However, D-dimer determinations appear to provide an easy, relatively inexpensive means of evaluating trauma patients for the risk of pathologic thrombosis."
CD010864,0,22457304,0,Diagnostic tests and strategies in venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a term including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Timely and accurate diagnosis of both is essential as delayed or missed diagnoses can result in death or longer term complications. Patients with suspected DVT should initially undergo a pretest probability Wells score. Depending on pretest probability Wells score they should then either proceed to two-point ultrasound scanning or D-dimer testing. Likewise, patients suspected of PE should undergo a two-level PE Wells score, and, if scored likely, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA), or, if there is a low pretest probability score, D-dimer testing. If positive, patients should undergo CTPA. Ventilation perfusion scanning (V/Q scan) or V/Q SPECT should be considered in place of CTPA if there is allergy to contrast media or renal impairment."

The files and computer records of 850 patients older than 16 years of age who were seen in the Hacettepe University Hospital ED between April 10, 2001, and December 1, 2005, and who required CTPA for PE prediagnosis and/or another diagnosis, were studied retrospectively. PE was identified by CTPA in 9.4% of 416 women and in 5.8% of 434 men. A significant difference (P<.05) was noted in the women and men in whom PE was detected. The mean age of the patients was 58.13+/-17.88 y (range, 16-100 y). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for clinical susceptibility to PE among patients who underwent CTPA were assessed at 95.3%, 48.2%, 13%, and 99.2%, respectively. CTPA was done for different reasons: aortic aneurysm dissection (n=1), cough distinctive diagnosis (n=1), dyspnea distinctive diagnosis (n=6), chest pain distinctive diagnosis (n=3), PE prediagnosis (n=51), and other reasons (n=2). Also, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were found to be 95.4%, 16.2%, 14.4%, and 96%, respectively, for D-dimer. CTPA, which is accessible on a 24-h basis in the ED, is a valuable tool for the diagnosis of PE."
CD010864,0,10744147,0,Derivation of a simple clinical model to categorize patients probability of pulmonary embolism: increasing the models utility with the SimpliRED D-dimer.,"We have previously demonstrated that a clinical model can be safely used in a management strategy in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). We sought to simplify the clinical model and determine a scoring system, that when combined with D-dimer results, would safely exclude PE without the need for other tests, in a large proportion of patients. We used a randomly selected sample of 80% of the patients that participated in a prospective cohort study of patients with suspected PE to perform a logistic regression analysis on 40 clinical variables to create a simple clinical prediction rule. Cut points on the new rule were determined to create two scoring systems. In the first scoring system patients were classified as having low, moderate and high probability of PE with the proportions being similar to those determined in our original study. The second system was designed to create two categories, PE likely and unlikely. The goal in the latter was that PE unlikely patients with a negative D-dimer result would have PE in less than 2% of cases. The proportion of patients with PE in each category was determined overall and according to a positive or negative SimpliRED D-dimer result. After these determinations we applied the models to the remaining 20% of patients as a validation of the results. The following seven variables and assigned scores (in brackets) were included in the clinical prediction rule: Clinical symptoms of DVT (3.0), no alternative diagnosis (3.0), heart rate >100 (1.5), immobilization or surgery in the previous four weeks (1.5), previous DVT/PE (1.5), hemoptysis (1.0) and malignancy (1.0). Patients were considered low probability if the score was <2.0, moderate of the score was 2.0 to 6.0 and high if the score was over 6.0. Pulmonary embolism unlikely was assigned to patients with scores < or =4.0 and PE likely if the score was >4.0. 7.8% of patients with scores of less than or equal to 4 had PE but if the D-dimer was negative in these patients the rate of PE was only 2.2% (95% CI = 1.0% to 4.0%) in the derivation set and 1.7% in the validation set. Importantly this combination occurred in 46% of our study patients. A score of <2.0 and a negative D-dimer results in a PE rate of 1.5% (95% CI = 0.4% to 3.7%) in the derivation set and 2.7% (95% CI = 0.3% to 9.0%) in the validation set and only occurred in 29% of patients. The combination of a score < or =4.0 by our simple clinical prediction rule and a negative SimpliRED D-Dimer result may safely exclude PE in a large proportion of patients with suspected PE."

CD010864,0,9262113,0,The role of D-dimer in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.,"The diagnosis of venous thromboembolism remains a clinical challenge. D-dimer, a specific breakdown product of crosslinked fibrin, is a sensitive marker for acute thrombosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that D-dimer testing has a promising role as an exclusionary test in patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. However, a wide range of sensitivities and specificities has been reported for D-dimer assays because of inter- and intra-assay variations and differences in patient populations. New rapid D-dimer enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and the whole blood agglutination assay SimpliRED (Agen Biomedical, Brisbane, Australia) D-dimer have high negative predictive values. Recent studies have shown that a normal result on a SimpliRED assay combined with a low pre-test probability or normal result on impedance plethysmography reliably excludes venous thrombosis. Latex agglutination assays are relatively insensitive as screening tests and should not be used. Management studies are underway and will further delineate the role of D-dimer testing in patients with suspected venous thromboembolism."

This patient series was also used to compare several methods of performing and interpreting LS images. The final diagnosis was established independently by a separate panel with all available information except for the result of DDA. D-dimer was determined by ELISA (threshold value 500 ng/ml). LS, including perfusion (.Q) and pseudo-ventilation (Technegas) (.V), was classified according to PIOPED, (1) immediately by the physician on duty, and (2) retrospectively by a blinded panel. A positive (19) or negative (61) diagnosis of PE was achieved in 80 patients, the prevalence of PE being 24%. Only one false-negative was noted on DDA (sensitivity=95%) but there were 42 false-positives (specificity=31%), resulting in a positive predictive value of 30% and a negative predictive value of 95%. Emergency and retrospective interpretations of LS were close (kappa=0.4). In a minority of patients, PE may be excluded with reasonable certainty if DDA is normal, resulting in a significant saving in terms of time and money."

The diagnostic value of the D-dimer assay for DVT was evaluated with contrast venography as reference. The diagnostic value of the D-dimer assay for PE was evaluated with pulmonary scintigraphy as reference. D-dimer tests were examined from 54 consecutive patients.

Using reference diagnostic results of high probability and low probability for the diagnosis of PE, the D-dimer test sensitivity and specificity was found to be 40% and 94%, respectively (PPV: 86%, NPV: 64%). The diagnostic value of the Nycocard(R) assay appears to be very limited for the diagnosis of DVT and PE. This retrospective study suggests that it is unsuitable as a screening method.

This study aimed to assess the role of VEGF and sICAM-1 in control of pleural effusions (PE) and survival in patients with primary human lung adenocarcinoma. Using enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay, the concentrations of VEGF and sICAM-1 were measured in pleural effusions and serum from a total of 79 lung adenocarcinoma patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPE) and 24 patients with tuberculosis. Data were correlated with the efficacy of MPE control and survival. Compared to patients with tuberculosis, the levels of VEGF and sICAM-1 in both PE and serum were significantly higher in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Statistically significant correlation was observed between PE VEGF levels and MPE control. PE VEGFâ¥2760 pg/ml was used as a cut-off point for failure to MPE control (odds ratio=7.06; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.40-20.78; P<0.001). The median progression-free survival (PFS) from response assessment was 3 months. In a multivariate analysis, PE VEGF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02-1.32), serum sICAM-1 (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.17-3.07) were confirmed as independent prognostic factors for PFS. The levels of VEGF in PE can be used to predict the therapeutic efficacy in the control of MPE and this, together with serum level of sICAM-1 is potential survival factors in lung adenocarcinoma patients with MPE."

Recent studies have addressed these issues by developing a new clinical decision rule and raising the D-dimer level cut-off points. With imaging of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) the radiation exposure remains a concern. Recent studies have adjusted CT settings and scan length to minimize this exposure without loss of image quality. Furthermore the first choice imaging modality of suspected PE in pregnant women remains a matter of debate in view of studies showing high inadequacy rates for both CT scanning and VQ scanning. Issues concerning the diagnostic management of VTE in pregnant women and advancements made in recent years will be discussed.

CD010864,0,16387180,0,Transforming growth factor beta-1 influence on fetal allografts during pregnancy.,"An understanding of how the fetus escapes the maternal immune system may be relevant for the prevention of transplant rejection. There is evidence that the same immunosuppressive cytokines contribute to a successful pregnancy and transplant success. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine that exhibits potent immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory properties and may prolong graft survival. Recent reports suggest a role for TGF-beta in the generation of T-regulatory lymphocytes. Also, the role of TGF-beta in trophoblast differentiation and hypertension prompted us to evaluate maternal serum TGF-beta1 levels in normal allopregnant women and in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia (PE), a disorder characterized by increased blood pressure, proteinuria, and end organ damage. Sixty-one pregnant preeclamptic women (32 cases with severe and 29 with mild PE), 22 normotensive healthy pregnant, and 20 nonpregnant controls formed the study groups. The active form of serum TGF-beta1 was investigated by an indirect ELISA technique. The results showed that TGF-beta1 was highly expressed in all three pregnant groups compared with the nonpregnant controls. No changes in TGF-beta1 serum levels was found in PE compared with a normal pregnancy. The results suggest that: (1) TGF-beta1 may function as a regulatory factor in fetal allograft survival during pregnancy and (2) TGF-beta1 does not have a pathophysiological role in PE."
CD010864,0,1670841,1,Measurement of D-dimer in plasma as diagnostic aid in suspected pulmonary embolism.,"The potential of plasma measurement of D-dimer (DD), a specific derivative of crosslinked fibrin, for diagnosis or exclusion of pulmonary embolism was investigated in a prospective series of 171 consecutive patients who attended an emergency department with suspected pulmonary embolism. The diagnosis was made or excluded by means of a clinical decision-making process which included clinical evaluation, ventilation-perfusion (VQ) lung scan, and, as indicated, pulmonary angiography, venography, or non-invasive examination of the leg veins. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed by this process in 55 (32%) of 170 patients with sufficient data. All but 1 of these 55 patients had a DD concentration of 500 micrograms/l or above. The sensitivity and specificity of this cutoff concentration for the presence of pulmonary embolism were 98% and 39%, respectively, which give positive and negative predictive values of 44% and 98%. Among the 115 patients (68%) who had inconclusive VQ scans, 31 were diagnosed as having pulmonary embolism. 29 of the remaining 84 patients without pulmonary embolism had DD concentrations below 500 micrograms/l, which means that further diagnostic procedures could have been avoided in a quarter of the patients with inconclusive VQ scans. The sensitivity of the plasma measurement of DD remained high even 3 and 7 days after presentation (96% and 93%). Plasma measurement of DD therefore has a definite place in the diagnostic procedure for suspected acute pulmonary embolism in attenders at emergency departments: a concentration below 500 micrograms/l rules out the diagnosis."

CD010864,0,23372157,0,Human CD300C delivers an Fc receptor-Î³-dependent activating signal in mast cells and monocytes and differs from CD300A in ligand recognition.,"CD300C is highly homologous with an inhibitory receptor CD300A in an immunoglobulin-like domain among the human CD300 family of paired immune receptors. To clarify the precise expression and function of CD300C, we generated antibodies discriminating between CD300A and CD300C, which recognized a unique epitope involving amino acid residues CD300A(F56-L57) and CD300C(L63-R64). Notably, CD300C was highly expressed in human monocytes and mast cells. Cross-linking of CD300C by its specific antibody caused cytokine/chemokine production of human monocytes and mast cells. Fc receptor Î³ was indispensable for both efficient surface expression and activating functions of CD300C. To identify a ligand for CD300A or CD300C, we used reporter cell lines expressing a chimera receptor harboring extracellular CD300A or CD300C and intracellular CD3Î¶, in which its unknown ligand induced GFP expression. Our results indicated that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) among the lipids tested and apoptotic cells were possible ligands for both CD300C and CD300A. PE and apoptotic cells more strongly induced GFP expression in the reporter cells through binding to extracellular CD300A as compared with CD300C. Differential recognition of PE by extracellular CD300A and CD300C depended on different amino acid residues CD300A(F56-L57) and CD300C(L63-R64). Interestingly, GFP expression induced by extracellular CD300C-PE binding in the reporter cells was dampened by co-expression of full-length CD300A, indicating the predominance of CD300A over CD300C in PE recognition/signaling. PE consistently failed to stimulate cytokine production in monocytes expressing CD300C with CD300A. In conclusion, specific engagement of CD300C led to Fc receptor Î³-dependent activation of mast cells and monocytes."
CD010864,0,9619430,0,Effects of polyethylene particles on tissue surrounding knee arthroplasties in rabbits.,"Clinical studies suggest a role for polyethylene (PE) wear debris in the pathogenesis of osteolysis and loosening of total joint replacements. In this study, submicron particles of ultrahigh molecular weight PE (UHMWPE) were placed around pressfit tibial hemiarthroplasties in rabbits to determine the biological reaction. After 6 months the periprosthetic tissue was harvested and characterized biochemically by measuring the extracellular matrix macromolecules, collagen, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and quantifying the expression of inflammatory/osteolytic mediators [prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), hexosaminidase, transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), and interleukins-6 and -1 (IL-6, IL-1)]. Particle exposure resulted in a decrease in levels of total extracellular matrix molecules including a 53% decrease in total GAG (p < 0.05) and a 74% decrease in total collagen (p < 0.005). Collagen content remained significantly decreased when normalized for cellularity (DNA content). Total TGF beta release exhibited a downward trend (p = 0.06) in the particle exposed group. Hexosaminidase and PGE2 levels did not show a difference between groups; however, when normalized for cellularity, PGE2 values exhibited an upward trend in the particle exposed group (p = 0.1). IL-6 was undetected by bioassay and ELISA. Previous studies emphasized that PE debris enhances the degradation of bone. The data from this in vivo model suggest that submicron UHMWPE particles may also act to inhibit biosynthetic pathways of bone and mesenchymal tissue. Decreased levels of collagen, GAG, and TGF beta expression may indicate suppression of bone formation, possibly through a downregulation of osteoblast activity."

Novel noninvasive instruments, such as plasma D-dimer measurement, lower limb compression ultrasonography and helical CT scan are important breakthroughs in the management of patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. However, none of these instruments is ideal, and they must be combined in rational and cost-effective diagnostic algorithms including clinical assessment, which is increasingly standardized. Such strategies must be validated in management studies, in which patients without venous thromboembolism are not treated and followed up during 3 months. Suspected massive pulmonary embolism is a distinct clinical situation requiring a specific diagnostic approach, in which echocardiography plays a major role. This paper reviews the performance of clinical evaluation and diagnostic tests for venous thromboembolism, and recently validated diagnostic schemes."

CD010864,0,1824609,0,Protein S and C alterations in acutely ill patients.,"Protein C, a potent vitamin K-dependent protein activated by an endothelial cell cofactor, thrombomodulin, has anticoagulant and profibrinolytic activity. Free protein S, a cofactor for protein C, potentiates protein C activity at the endothelial cell surface. Pulmonary thromboemboli are a consistent finding in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To determine if protein S or protein C were affected by widespread endothelial cell damage in ARDS, we measured bound and free protein S levels and protein C antigenic and functional levels in 18 patients with acute lung injury, 6 critically ill patients without lung history, and 22 normal subjects. Free (PS:F) and bound (PS:Ag) protein S and protein C antigen (PC:Ag) levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunoassay and protein C function (PC:Fn) by measuring its anticoagulant activity. We found a significant decrease in bound and free protein S levels of both patient groups in comparison to normal and a shift toward the inactive, bound protein S form. In addition, a significant decrease in free protein S compared to bound protein S in both patient groups was observed. While both PC:Ag and PC:Fn were significantly reduced compared to normal, the PC:Fn was significantly and severely decreased out of proportion to the PC:Ag in both patient groups. There was no difference between those with and without lung injury for both protein S and protein C. Analyzed according to etiology of lung injury, there was no difference in the bound and free protein S, nor in PC:Ag and PC:Fn levels between patients with sepsis and trauma. However, there were significant decreases in both protein S and protein C levels compared with normal subjects. Levels of both PS and PC levels in patients who survived did not differ from those who died. In summary, our data show that both protein S and C are markedly deranged in acutely ill patients who suffered from either sepsis or trauma, and these changes are independent of lung injury. The marked reductions in functional activity of PS and PC may be contributing factors to the thromboembolic complications often observed in these patients."

The antibody discriminates between native prothrombin and F 1 + 2 in plasma. A synthetic peptide from the negatively charged region of F 1 + 2, which becomes the carboxy-terminal sequence after cleavage of prothrombin by factor Xa, was used for immunization of rabbits. Obtained antiserum was immunopurified and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was constructed for determination of F 1 + 2. The test system follows the sandwich principle and uses two different antibodies directed against F 1 + 2 and prothrombin, respectively. The ELISA was calibrated with purified F 1 + 2 added to F 1 + 2-poor plasma. The lower limit of sensitivity of the assay was 0.02 nmol/l. Coefficients of variation of 6.9 to 10.4% (intraassay) and 6.7 to 11% (interassay) were found for F 1 + 2 concentrations between 0.08 and 4.9 nmol/l. A reference range from 0.32 to 1.2 nmol/l was calculated from 95 healthy donors (mean value +/- SD: 0.67 +/- 0.19 nmol/l). In patients with deep vein thrombosis (n = 7) confirmed by phlebography and in patients with pulmonary embolism (n = 8) confirmed by lung scan, F 1 + 2 levels were found up to 1.5 to 9.5 nmol/l. In plasma samples of patients under oral anticoagulant therapy in the stable state F 1 + 2 concentrations were found to be in the range of 0.08 to 0.5 nmol/l.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010864,0,8394069,0,Infectious bursal disease virus structural protein VP2 expressed by a fowlpox virus recombinant confers protection against disease in chickens.,"Two fowlpox virus recombinants were constructed which expressed the host-protective antigen, VP2, of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Recombinant FPV-VP 2.4.3 contained the gene for the VP 2-VP4-VP3 polyprotein under the control of the vaccinia virus late promoter P.L 11 inserted within the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of FPV. In infected chicken embryo skin (CES) cells VP2 and VP3 proteins were correctly processed from the polyprotein precursor molecule. Recombinant FPV-VP2 contained only the VP2 encoding region under the control of the fowlpox early/late promoter P.E/L inserted immediately downstream of the TK gene. The expression level of VP2 from FPV-VP2 was approximately 5 times higher than from FPV-VP2.4.3. Wing web inoculation of birds resulted in the development of typical fowlpox lesions and the development of antibodies to FPV with either of the recombinants, but only birds vaccinated with FPV-VP2 developed antibodies to IBDV. When challenged with IBDV (strain 002-73), a significant level of protection was provided by FPV-VP2 vaccination, although the level was lower than the protection provided by an oil adjuvanted inactivated whole IBDV vaccine. Birds vaccinated with FPV-VP2.4.3 were not protected from infection as assessed by ELISA for the presence of IBD virus in bursae."

CD010864,0,21756405,0,Evaluation of 7 serum biomarkers and uterine artery Doppler ultrasound for first-trimester prediction of preeclampsia: a systematic review.,"Preeclampsia (PE) affects 1% to 2% of pregnant women and is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The clinical syndrome of PE arises in the second half of pregnancy. However, many underlying factors including defective placentation may already be apparent in the first and early second trimester in many patients. In clinical practice, there is currently no reliable screening method in the first trimester of pregnancy with sufficient accuracy to identify women at high risk to develop PE. Early identification of high-risk pregnancy may facilitate the development of new strategies for antenatal surveillance or prevention and thus improve maternal and perinatal outcome. The aim of this systematic review was to study the literature on the predictive potential of first-trimester serum markers and of uterine artery Doppler velocity waveform assessment (Ut-A Doppler). Literature on the 7 most studied serum markers (ADAM12, fÎ²-hCG, Inhibin A, Activin A, PP13, PlGF, and PAPP-A) and Ut-A Doppler was primarily selected. In the selected literature, a combination of these markers was analyzed, and where relevant, the value of maternal characteristics was added. Measurements of serum markers and Ut-A Doppler were performed between week 8 + 0 and 14 + 0 GA. Low levels of PP13, PlGF, and PAPP-A and elevated level of Inhibin A have been found to be significantly associated with the development of PE later in pregnancy. The detection rates of single markers, fixed at 10% false-positive rate, in the prediction of early-onset PE were relatively low, and ranged from 22% to 83%. Detection rates for combinations of multiple markers varied between 38% and 100%. Therefore, a combination of multiple markers yields high detection rates and is promising to identify patients at high risk of developing PE. However, large scale prospective studies are required to evaluate the power of this integrated approach in clinical practice."

A systematic review of management outcome studies.,"Clinical outcome studies have shown that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) who have a negative D-dimer result and a low pretest probability (PTP) either using a PTP model or clinical gestalt. It was the objective of the present study to assess the safety of the combination of a negative VIDAS D-dimer result in combination with a non-high PTP using the Wells or Geneva models to exclude PE. A systematic literature search strategy was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and all EBM Reviews. Seven studies (6 prospective management studies and 1 randomised controlled trial) reporting failure rates at three months were included in the analysis. Non-high PTP was defined as ""unlikely"" using the Wells' model, or ""low/intermediate"" PTP using either the Geneva score, the Revised Geneva Score, or clinical gestalt. Two reviewers independently extracted data onto standardised forms. A total of 5,622 patients with low/intermediate or unlikely PTP were assessed using the VIDAS D-dimer. PE was ruled out by a negative D-dimer test in 2,248 (40%, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 38.7 to 41.3%) of them. The three-month thromboembolic risk in patients left untreated on the basis of a low/intermediate or unlikely PTP and a negative D-dimer test was 3/2,166 (0.14%, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.41%). In conclusion, the combination of a negative VIDAS D-dimer result and a non-high PTP effectively and safely excludes PE in an important proportion of outpatients with suspected PE."
CD010864,0,8272187,0,Investigations into the biochemical basis of neuromodulation by 2-phenylethylamine: effect on microtubule protein.,"In order to understand the role of 2-phenylethylamine (PE) on neuronal responses, membrane changes have been studied using ESR probes. We report that the anticipated change in lipid membrane fluidity generally implicated in signal transduction has not been observed when PE is added to synaptosomes. As cytoskeletal architecture of presynaptic terminals appears to be involved in synaptic transmission, we non-specifically labeled synaptosomal membrane proteins with the sulfhydryl spin probe N-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl-4-yl) maleimide (4-MAL-TEMPO). The addition of 2-phenylethylamine was found to induce conformational changes, in decreasing the ratio of weakly to strongly immobilized spin label (W/S) to 65% of the control. Of the membrane proteins labeled, 70-90% of the 4-MAL-TEMPO is covalently incorporated into cytoskeletal proteins. In isolated synaptosomes, incorporated with spin-labeled tubulin, the addition of PE reduced the W/S ratio to 51.6% of that obtained for polymerized microtubules. In vitro, PE reduced tau R of polymerized microtubules by 37%. We propose that the PE interaction with tubulin changes microtubule dynamics which may lead to its neuromodulatory action. The state of microtubular assembly can modulate the responsiveness of second messengers in the cell to the effect of stimulatory agents. The nature and physiological significance of PE interaction with tubulin is currently under investigation."
CD010864,0,22466814,0,The incidence of venous thromboembolism following stroke and its risk factors in eastern China.,"Few studies have documented the prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the Chinese population. We aimed to investigate the incidence of VTE following stroke and to determine the potential risk factors for the onset of VTE in patients of eastern China. A prospective multi-center study was conducted. A total of 1,380 patients with acute stroke received venous duplex ultrasound (VDU) examination on both lower limbs. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel index (BI), Wells, and modified Rankin scale scores were determined. Among 1,380 cases of acute stroke, 4.49 % (62 cases) had deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and 0.80 % (11 cases) had pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). In the cases of DVT, 48.4 % had no clinical symptoms. The independent risk factors for the incidence of DVT, following the acute stage of stroke, were an age â¥ 70 years, bed-ridden, a Wells score â¥ 2, an NIHSS score of lower limbs â¥ 3, a low BI score, and an elevated concentration of D: -dimer. Rehabilitative and anti-coagulant therapy prevented the incidence of DVT following stroke. Moreover, an age â¥ 70 years, bed-ridden and having DVT were the independent risk factors for the incidence of PTE among stroke patients during the acute stage. Finally, 1.51 % of the patients had DVT whereas no PTE occurred during the period of the follow-up study. VDU examination is recommended for patients with acute stroke, which may help to diagnose and treat asymptomatic DVT early as well as prevent the subsequent incidence of PTE."

A total of 30, 4-week-old pigs seronegative for PRRSV were allocated to 1 of 3 groups (IM, ID, and C groups). At 5 weeks of age, pigs of groups IM (n=10 pigs) and ID (n=10 pigs) were vaccinated intramuscularly and intradermally, respectively, with modified live PRRSV-1 vaccine (Porcilis) PRRS). Pigs of group C (n=10 pigs) were kept as non-vaccinated controls. At post-vaccination (PV) days 0, 7, 14, 28, and 45, blood samples were collected for detection of vaccine virus (PCR) and antibody response (ELISA), identification of changes in lymphocyte subpopulations by cytometry, and IFN-gamma PRRSV-specific secreting cells (SC) by ELISpot. At PV day 45, pigs of A, B, and C groups were moved to a site 3 conventional finishing herd with a history of respiratory disease caused by PRRSV and the most common bacteria to be exposed to a natural challenge. The PRRSV field strain, belonging to the Italian cluster of the PRRSV-1, demonstrated a 84% identity with the vaccine virus (DV strain) at ORF5 sequencing. At 0 (exposure day=45 days PV), 4, 7, 11, 14, 19, 21, 28, and 34 days post-exposure (PE) blood samples were collected for detection and titration of PRRSV and antibody, as well as for lymphocyte and IFN-gamma measurement as described above. Throughout the post-exposure period, all pigs were observed daily for clinical signs. The overall clinical signs were reduced by 68 and 72%, respectively in the intramuscularly and intradermally vaccinated pigs compared to controls. Respiratory signs were reduced by 72 and 80%, respectively in the IM and ID groups. Clinical protection was associated with marked activation of cell-mediated immune response. The highest levels of specific IFN-gamma production at 21-34 days PE were concomitant and associated to changes in natural killer (NK) cells, gamma/delta T, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the blood. In our field study, evidences of EU attenuated vaccine-induced clinical protection against natural exposure to a genetically diverse (84% homology) PRRSV-1 isolate (Italian cluster) was demonstrated by the statistically significant reduction in clinical signs in terms of incidence, duration and severity and by a more efficient cell-mediated immune response in the vaccinated pigs as compared to the unvaccinated controls."

Clinical assessment tools, D-dimer testing, ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scanning, ultrasound of the lower limbs, computed tomography (CT), and pulmonary angiography are all adequate methods used in the diagnosis of acute PE. With several options available to physicians, variation in regional costs and practices, and conflicting views on imaging modality performance data, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the most cost-effective strategy. Cost-effectiveness analysis is a helpful tool for determining the most effective diagnostic strategy when several viable options exist. Although limited by a number of necessary assumptions, cost-effective analyses offer a feasible solution to a diagnostic process by using an evidence-based approach. Current evidence shows that CT is a cost-effective alternative to V/Q scanning, particularly when sensitivity is sufficiently high. The purpose of this article is to review the cost-effective role of CT in the diagnosis of acute PE."

Here, we prospectively investigated the DVT risk in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with lenalidomide (n = 32). Five patients developed six incidents of DVT over 1 year for an annual incidence of 16%. Three of these were considered drug-related. Median time to DVT was 105 days (range 56-259 days). No pulmonary embolism was detected. Hypercoagulability screen before study entry was negative in all patients who subsequently developed DVTs. Compared to normal volunteers CLL patients had increased baseline levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin, soluble vascular endothelial adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), and thrombomodulin (p < 0.001). After 1 week on lenalidomide D-dimer, thrombomodulin, sVCAM-1, factor VIII, TNFÎ±, and C-reactive protein were significantly increased while protein C was decreased (p < 0.001). In patients with lenalidomide-related DVTs, TNFÎ±, and sVCAM-1 were more strongly upregulated than in all other patients (p < 0.05) and TNFÎ± and sVCAM-1 levels were significantly correlated (r = 0.65, p < 0.001). These data link lenalidomide associated DVTs with TNFÎ± upregulation and endothelial cell dysfunction and suggest that aspirin may have a role for DVT prophylaxis in these patients."

Plasma cross-linked fibrin degradation products were measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay that recognizes the D-Dimer epitope. 24 patients with PE showed elevated D-Dimer levels (median; 25%-, 75%-quartile) (3,250 ng/ml; 1,270 ng/ml, 6,940 ng/ml) as well as 38 patients presenting with DVT (2,330 ng/ml; 1,760 ng/ml, 3,980 ng/ml). The sensitivity for the diagnosis of PE was 92%, for diagnosis of DVT 89% resp. 100%, depending on the cut-off limit. The D-Dimer level showed a correlation (r = 0.64) to the angiographically documented severity of PE quantified by the Miller's score, in contrast to DVT, where no such correlation could be found. During fibrinolytic therapy median levels rose from 3,020 ng/ml to 63,000 ng/ml within 8 hours and then fell within 6 days to 2,930 ng/ml. 10 patients with PE showed a good correlation (r = 0.72) between the reduction of Miller's score within 72 hours and D-Dimer 24 hours after the onset of therapy. In 17 patients with fibrinolytic treatment of DVT no correlation between D-Dimer and clot lysis could be found. These findings indicate that D-Dimer can provide additional information in the diagnostic procedure of suspected PE. During fibrinolytic therapy of PE with streptokinase, D-Dimer could serve as an early prognostic parameter of successful thrombolysis."

Two of the patients with malignant tumor presented pulmonary embolism after operation. Plasma fibrinogen and fibrin degradation product levels in patients with malignant tumors were already high before operation and further increased significantly after operation. The plasma levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and free-tissue factor pathway inhibitor were increased in both groups after operation, but they were higher in patients with malignant tumors than in patients with benign tumors. The plasma levels of protein C and antithrombin were significantly decreased in both groups after operation. but they were significantly lower in patients with malignant tumors than in those with benign tumors. The decreased activity of protein C or antithrombin may be not only a risk factor of thrombotic disease, such as pulmonary embolism, but also the cause of thrombosis. In patients with malignant tumors, the operation time was significantly longer than that in patients with benign tumors. This long operative period might cause vascular endothelial cell injury which is reflected by the plasma levels of free-tissue factor pathway inhibitor, antithrombin, and protein C."
CD010864,0,7989553,0,Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measuring ileal symbiont intracellularis-specific immunoglobulin G response in sera of pigs.,"Proliferative enteritis (PE) is a common intestinal disease on pig farms. The disease is caused by ileal symbiont (IS) intracellularis (Campylobacter-like organisms) bacteria. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to measure IS intracellularis-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) response in the sera of pigs. The antigen used in the ELISA was filtered, percoll gradient-purified IS intracellularis extracted from the intestines of pigs affected with proliferative hemorrhagic enteropathy. The antibody responses of pigs challenged with intestinal homogenates from pigs affected with proliferative hemorrhagic enteropathy containing IS intracellularis or percoll-gradient purified IS intracellularis were low and variable. The low IgG titers measured in challenged pigs support previous findings that IgG plays a minor role in the immune response of pigs to IS intracellularis. On a farm in which infection was endemic, pigs seroconverted at between 7 and 24 weeks of age. High IgG titers, indicative of maternally acquired antibody, were present in 3-week-old pigs. The IgG titers in piglets were lowest at 6 weeks of age, which approximates the age of onset of clinical disease. These results suggest that IgG plays a role in determining the susceptibilities of pigs to natural infection. Measurements of seroconversion by the ELISA might aid in epidemiological investigations of PE in naturally infected herds. However, the variable antibody responses in experimentally challenged pigs would seem to limit its usefulness as an antemortem diagnostic test for PE."

Case 2: A 39-year-old male presented with prolonged high-grade fever even after administration of anti-tuberculosis drugs and complained of weakness. His D-dimer was high on admission and became still higher; then, edema was found on his left lower limb, and he was diagnosed with DVT on the basis of lower limb ultrasonography showing isoechoic thrombosis from the IVC to the left popliteal vein. An IVC filter was needed to treat his lesion. Case 3: A 69-year-old female with elevated D-dimer and edema on the right lower limb was diagnosed with PTE and DVT on the basis of chest CT findings.

A serological survey of tick-borne diseases was conducted to supplement the PE study. PE data collection tools consisted primarily of focus group interviews and key informant interviews supplemented by observation. Information was collected on the social context, history and species of livestock kept. Constraints in livestock keeping were explored through description and probing. Proportional piling on the importance of different diseases and relative incidence scoring were also conducted. 243 sera were collected from cattle and tested for antibodies to Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina, B. bovis, Theileria mutans and T. parva by ELISA. Additionally, 173 blood samples were collected for a PCR assay of T. parva. Livestock diseases were ranked as the most important constraint to livestock keeping. While East Coast fever was ranked as the most important disease in Kajo Keji, diarrhoea in small ruminants was reported as the most important disease in Yei. Serological analyses of the sera indicated that A. marginale, B. bigemina, T. mutans and T. parva were most prevalent. Prevalence of B. bovis was found to be low (4.0% and 7.4% in Kajo Keji and Yei, respectively). 35% of the samples screened with the T. parva p104 gene nested PCR assay were positive. The study concludes that while ECF is the most important disease in Kajo Keji, it was not the case in Yei. Additional epidemiological studies are proposed before control strategies are recommended."
CD010864,0,19591097,0,[Methods of estimating concentration of the D-dimers used in venous thromboembolism diagnosis].,"D-dimers (DD) are final products of stabilized fibrin degradation process. Elevated level of DD indicates parallel activation of both coagulation and fibrinolysis. D-dimers play important role in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. All diagnostic methods detecting DD are based on monoclonal antibodies. There are three basic techniques used to measure DD: latex agglutination, full blood agglutination and immunoenzymatic methods. Nowadays new methods based on in vivo detection of DD using antibodies labeled with technetium are under clinical evaluation."
CD010864,0,8320080,0,Effect of verapamil on the IL-2 binding to its active receptor and on the release of IL-2 receptor by activated PBMC.,"In the present study we have examined the effect of a Ca2+ channel blocker (verapamil) on the binding of IL-2 to its biologically active receptor (IL-2R), as well as on the release of its soluble form (sIL-2R) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated by a variety of stimuli. In the same culture systems, cyclosporine A (CsA) was also used as an additional dissecting tool. PHA and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 enhanced both the percentage of PBMC binding phycoerythrin-conjugated IL-2 (PE-IL-2) and the mean fluorescence intensity of this binding. A phorbol-ester (PMA), on the other hand, enhanced only slightly the proportion of PE-IL-2 binding cells. The two stimulatory combinations (PHA/PMA and A23187/PMA) also up-regulated the proportion of PE-IL-2 binding cells and the fluorescence intensity; the PHA/PMA combination was the most potent of all stimuli used. These two stimulatory combinations, and PHA alone, were also associated with maximal in vitro release of sIL-2R. Verapamil significantly down-regulated PE-IL-2 binding in all culture systems and it convincingly inhibited the release of sIL-2R. Furthermore, this mode of action of verapamil was concentration-dependent. CsA, on the other hand, inhibited the binding of PE-IL-2 to all stimulant-activated PBMC and had only a slight inhibitory effect on the in vitro release of sIL-2R. Our results indicate that there is a correlation between the binding of IL-2 to biologically active receptors on the surface of stimulant-activated PBMC and the release of the soluble form of IL-2R by the same cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010864,0,19277509,0,Inhibitory effect of a phosphatidyl ethanolamine derivative on LPS-induced sepsis.,"Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. Today, around 60% of all cases of sepsis are caused by Gram-negative bacteria. The cell wall component lipopoly-saccharide (LPS) is the main initiator of the cascade of cellular reactions in Gram-negative infections. The core receptors for LPS are toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MD-2 and CD14. Attempts have been made to antagonize the toxic effect of endotoxin using monoclonal antibodies against CD14 and synthetic lipopolysaccharides but there is as yet no effective treatment for septic syndrome. Here, we describe an inhibitory effect of a phosphatidylethanolamine derivative, PE-DTPA (phosphatidylethanolamine diethyl-enetriaminepentaacetate) on LPS recognition. PE-DTPA bound strongly to CD14 (K ( d ), 9.52 x 10(-8) M). It dose dependency inhibited LPS-mediated activation of human myeloid cells, mouse macrophage cells and human whole blood as measured by the production of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide, whereas other phospho-lipids including phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine had little effect. PE-DTPA also inhibited transcription dependent on NF-kappaB activation when it was added together with LPS, and it rescued LPS-primed mice from septic death. These results suggest that PE-DTPA is a potent antagonist of LPS, and that it acts by competing for binding to CD14."

CD010864,0,19393342,0,Chronic epigallocatechin-gallate improves aortic reactivity of diabetic rats: underlying mechanisms.,"Diabetes mellitus is associated with major cardiovascular risk factors which are responsible for excess morbidity and mortality. Green tea catechins including epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) could exert beneficial health effects to ameliorate cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Thus, the effect of chronic administration of EGCG was studied on aortic reactivity of streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. Male diabetic rats received EGCG 25 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks 1 week after diabetes induction. Contractile responses to KCl and phenylephrine (PE) and relaxation responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were obtained from aortic rings. Maximum contractile response of endothelium-intact rings to KCL and PE was significantly lower in EGCG-treated diabetic rats relative to untreated diabetic ones. Endothelium removal abolished the significant difference between EGCG-treated and untreated diabetic groups regarding contractile response to KCl and PE. Meanwhile, endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh was significantly higher in EGCG-treated diabetic rats as compared to diabetic ones. Pretreatment of rings with N(omega)-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and indomethacin (INDO) significantly attenuated the observed responses. Meanwhile, two-month diabetes resulted in an elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in aortic tissue and EGCG treatment attenuated the increased MDA content and reduced activity of SOD. Therefore, chronic treatment of diabetic rats with EGCG could prevent the abnormal functional changes in vascular reactivity in diabetic rats through nitric oxide- and prostaglandin-dependent pathways and via attenuation of aortic lipid peroxidation."

The antigen, env2-3 (SF2), was a nonglycosylated polypeptide representing the gp120 region of the env gene of the HIV-1(SF2) isolate. It was produced in genetically engineered yeast as a denatured molecule incapable of binding CD4. A synthetic lipophilic muramyl tripeptide (MTP-PE) was used as an adjuvant. Ten subjects received adjuvant alone and 15 received 50- or 250-micrograms doses of env2-3 (SF2) administered intramuscularly in two immunization regimens. In general, adjuvant and vaccine were well tolerated. Antibody responses to both the homologous antigen, env2-3 (SF2), and antigens from other highly divergent HIV isolates were elicited in the majority of vaccine recipients. However, antibody titers were low, without neutralizing activity. In 9 of 11 subjects who received the complete vaccine immunization series, a significant specific T lymphocyte response was observed."

CD010864,0,11434084,0,[Usefulness of measuring levels of d-dimer for diagnosis of hospital venous thromboembolism].,"D-dimer measurement with highly sensitive tests seems useful to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, nonspecific increase in d-dimer is common among inpatients. The aim of our study was to check: 1) whether the frequency of normal DD level in inpatients justifies its assessment as a part of diagnostic strategy for VTE, 2) whether tests that we are using are sensitive enough to exclude PE and DVT. In 27 (47%) out of 58 hospitalised patients evaluated by ultrafast ELISA (VIDAS bioMerieux), but in none of 20/58 patients with confirmed VTE, DD-level was found normal. In 35 of those patients DD was measured also with microlatex tests--Tinaquant and BC d-dimer. In 14/35 patients imaging test confirmed VTE. Sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) respectively were following: VIDAS: 100%, 80%, 100%, Tinaquant: 100%, 48%, 100%, BC d-dimer: 29%, 90%, 70%. Our results suggest that: 1) the relatively high frequency of normal DD-level among inpatients justifies its use in diagnostic strategies involving hospitalised patients, 2) negative VIDAS test confirms its as reliability for excluding VTE while 3) high sensitivity found for Tinaquant test encourages further prospective studies, 4) sensitivity of BC d-dimer is too low to be useful for excluding VTE."

CD010864,0,17154039,0,[A case of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome with elevated IgG anticardiolipin antibody titer with recurrent deep venous thromboses].,"We report a 76-year-old woman with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) who developed recurrent deep venous thromboses (DVT). She has had no past medical history of thromboembolic events or fetal loss. Because D-dimer was elevated from the early stage of her illness, heparin, and then warfarin, was given as prophylaxis for thromboembolic events. On Day 103, she developed marked edema in her legs, and DVT was diagnosed in the left popliteal vein by ultrasound. Three days later, the patient developed pulmonary embolism, and an inferior vena cava filter was implanted. Although D-dimer became temporarily normal, it increased again, and recurrent DVT was diagnosed in bilateral femoral veins on Day 167. IgG anticardiolipin antibody titer was found to be highly elevated at 79 U/ml (normal range: < 10). However, anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I antibody, which has been proven to be associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), was negative. Thus, IgG anticardiolipin may have played an important role in the thromboembolic events in this patient. We speculate that the occurrence of APS may be associated with anticardiolipin antibody, which may form in some patients with GBS secondary to myelin damage."
CD010864,0,20854422,0,Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1/GDF15): a new marker of all-cause mortality.,"Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1/GDF15) is a member of the TGF-b superfamily, previously studied in cancer and inflammation. In addition to regulating body weight, MIC-1/GDF15 may be used to predict mortality and/or disease course in cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic renal and heart failure, as well as pulmonary embolism. These data suggested that MIC-1/GDF15 may be a marker of all-cause mortality. To determine whether serum MIC-1/GDF15 estimation is a predictor of all-cause mortality, we examined a cohort of 876 male subjects aged 35-80 years, selected from the Swedish Population Registry, and followed them for overall mortality. Serum MIC-1/GDF15 levels were determined for all subjects from samples taken at study entry. A second (independent) cohort of 324 same-sex twins (69% female) from the Swedish Twin Registry was similarly examined. All the twins had telomere length measured and 183 had serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) available. Patients were followed for up to 14 years and had cause-specific and all-cause mortality determined. Serum MIC-1/GDF15 levels predicted mortality in the all-male cohort with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death of 3.38 (95%CI 1.38-8.26). This finding was validated in the twin cohort. Serum MIC-1/GDF15 remained an independent predictor of mortality when further adjusted for telomere length, IL-6 and CRP. Additionally, serum MIC-1/GDF15 levels were directly correlated with survival time independently of genetic background. Serum MIC-1/GDF15 is a novel predictor of all-cause mortality."

Laboratory examinations showed normal white cell count and moderate elevation of C reactive protein (CRP). Later, the thoracic pain increased accompanied by shortness of breath. High D-dimer was detected. Positive lupic anticoagulant factor and anticardiolipin and antibodies anti-Mycoplasma pneumoniae were present and high titres of antinuclear factor. Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator plus heparin and vancomycin were administered due the high possibility of mycoplasma pneumonia associated with pulmonary thromboembolism. CRP increased to very high levels with very mild modification of white blood cells during the evolution. Thoracic tomography and pulmonary scintigraphy of the lungs confirmed the diagnosis.

CD010864,0,22959553,0,Thrombolytic therapy for submassive pulmonary embolism.,"Approximately 10% of all patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) die within the first three months after diagnosis. However, PE is not universally life-threatening, but covers a wide spectrum of clinical severity and death risk. Thrombolytic treatment is indicated patients with acute massive PE who are at high risk for early death, i.e. those patients who present with arterial hypotension and shock. On the other hand, low molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux is adequate treatment for most normotensive patients with PE. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, given as 100 mg infusion over 2 h, is the treatment of choice for patients with PE, although older regimens using urokinase or streptokinase are also efficacious. Beyond the relatively small numbers of patients with massive, high-risk PE as a target population for thrombolysis, there is increasing awareness of the need for risk stratification of normotensive patients and the search for an intermediate-risk group (also called submassive PE). Recent meta-analyses of cohort studies suggest that imaging of the right ventricle or biomarkers of myocardial injury alone may be insufficient for guiding therapeutic decisions. Instead, accumulating evidence appears to support strategies which combine the information provided by an imaging procedure with a biomarker test. These data provide the rationale for a large multinational randomized trial which has set out to determine whether normotensive patients with right ventricular dysfunction, detected by echocardiography or computed tomography, plus evidence of myocardial injury as indicated by a positive troponin test, may benefit from early thrombolytic treatment. This study, which is underway in 13 European countries, will enroll a total of 1000 patients and will be completed in 2012. Together with a parallel trial currently being conducted in the United States, it will hopefully answer the question whether thrombolysis is indicated in submassive PE, thus terminating a 40-year-old debate and filling an important gap in our management concept for acute pulmonary embolism."

Spiral CT exhibited a sensitivity 91.9%; specificity 98.7%; PPV 97.1%; NPV 96.1%; accuracy 96.4%. No other test or clinical parameter had acceptable accuracy. The SimpliRED test is a latex method of estimating the level of D-dimer. The second part of this study determined that, in a similar consecutive series of patients referred for lung scintigrams, although SimpliRED tests had a NPV 95.5%, 59/126 (46.8%) consecutive were positive. However on the basis of clinical effectiveness and cost, imaging for suspected pulmonary embolism should be based on a combination of D-dimer estimation and spiral CT."

A total of 483 patients with a negative CTPA study were followed up for 3 months, with the aim of detecting episodes of venous thromboembolism and mortality. Three hundred and forty-nine patients had an immunochromatographic D-dimer assay called 'Simplify', carried out before a CTPA examination. Seventy-eight patients had a negative D-dimer assay and a negative CTPA. Three patients had a negative D-dimer assay and a positive CTPA. All three patients had a moderate pretest clinical probability. Of the 483 patients who had a negative CTPA and a 3-month follow up, 444 (92%) were alive and 39 (8%) had died. Of the 444 patients who were alive, none had any further suspected episode of thromboembolism or had received anticoagulation therapy within the follow-up period. Of those who died, none of the deaths was thought to be as a result of pulmonary embolism (PE). Single-detector helical CT can be used safely as the primary diagnostic test to evaluate PE. Negative Simplify D-dimer assay and low pretest clinical probability exclude CTPA-detectable PE, and a CTPA is unnecessary in this cohort of patients."
CD010864,0,19218659,0,Pleural fluid adenosine deaminase and interferon gamma as diagnostic tools in tuberculosis pleurisy.,"Several biological markers have been proposed to improve the efficacy of diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy. The study was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) concentration in differentiating tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) and nontuberculous pleural effusion (non-TPE). Ninety four patients (50 M and 44 F, mean age 60+/-18, range 18-95 years) with pleural effusion (PE) were studied. TPE was diagnosed in patients with: (i) positive pleural fluid or pleural biopsy culture or (ii) granulomas in the pleural biopsy specimen, after exclusion of other granulomatous diseases. Pleural fluid ADA activity was measured with the colorimetric method of Giusti, while IFN-gamma level was measured with ELISA. TPE was diagnosed in 28 patients. The non-TPE group consisted of 35 patients with malignant PE, 20 patients with parapneumonic effusion/pleural empyema, 5 with pleural transudate, and 6 with miscellaneous PE. The ADA activity and IFN-gamma concentration were significantly higher in TPE than in non-TPE (614.1+/-324.5 vs. 15.1+/-36.0 pg/ml, P<0.0001 and 75.1+/-39.1 vs. 11.0+/-16.6 U/l respectively, P<0.0001). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of IFN-gamma measurement (cut-off value of 75.0 pg/ml) were 100% and 98.5% respectively and were similar to those of ADA (100% and 93.9% at the cut-off value of 40.3 U/L). We conclude that pleural fluid ADA activity and IFN-gamma concentration are highly sensitive and specific markers of tuberculous pleurisy."
CD010864,0,11816700,0,"Prediction of pulmonary embolism extent by clinical findings, D-dimer level and deep vein thrombosis shown by ultrasound.","Pulmonary embolism (PE) may encompass a wide spectrum of severity. To determine whether clinical findings, D-dimer (DD) concentration, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) shown by lower-limb venous compression ultrasonography (US) might predict the scintigraphic extent of PE, we studied 104 hemodynamically stable consecutive outpatients with acute PE diagnosed by a high-probability ventilation-perfusion lung scan. Scintigraphic extent of PE was classified into three categories: perfusion defects corresponding to <30%, 30-50%, or >50% of the total lung area. Median respiratory and heart rates were found to be significantly related to the extent of PE. Higher median alveolar-arterial oxygen difference values were observed as the proportion of lung perfusion defects increased (>50% vs. <30%, 6.3 vs. 3.6 kPa, P <.0001). Median plasma DD concentration was 7950 microg/L in patients with >50% perfusion defects compared to 2731 microg/L in those with <30% defects (P = .0001). DD levels above 4000 microg/L were associated to more extensive perfusion defects (>50% vs. <30% defects, OR 30; 95% CI 5.8-155). Finally, a proximal DVT was more likely among patients with larger perfusion defects (>50% vs. <30% defects, OR 4.5; 95% CI 1.5-13.6). In conclusion, clinical signs such as tachypnea and tachycardia, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, plasma DD concentration, and presence of DVT on US are predictors of a larger PE, as assessed by the extent of perfusion defects on high probability lung scans."
CD010864,0,11816706,0,Increased brain natriuretic peptide as a marker for right ventricular dysfunction in acute pulmonary embolism.,"Right ventricular (RV) function is of major prognostic significance in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of neurohormone plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in assessing RV function in patients with acute PE. BNP levels were measured in 16 consecutive patients with acute PE as diagnosed by high probability lung scintigraphy or pulmonary angiography. Twelve healthy age-matched volunteers served as controls. All 16 patients underwent standard echocardiography and blood tests during the first hour of presentation. In the patient group, survival was studied for a period of 30 days. Plasma BNP levels in patients with acute PE were higher than in controls (7.2 [95% CI 0.4 to 144.6] versus 1.4[95% CI 0.4 to 4.6] pmol/L, p = 0.0008). Plasma BNP was significantly higher in 5 patients with RV dysfunction compared to II patients with normal RV function (40.2 [95% CI 7.5 to 214.9] versus 3.3 [95% CI 0.4 to 24.9] pmol/L, p = 0.0003). RV systolic pressure was not significantly correlated with BNP (r = 0.42, p = ns). In conclusion, plasma BNP neurohormone levels might be of clinical importance as a supplementary tool for assessment of RV function in patients with acute PE."

CD010864,0,23674436,0,White blood cell count and mortality in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.,"Although associated with adverse outcomes in other cardiovascular diseases, the prognostic value of an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, a marker of inflammation and hypercoagulability, is uncertain in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). We therefore sought to assess the prognostic impact of the WBC in a large, state-wide retrospective cohort of patients with PE. We evaluated 14,228 patient discharges with a primary diagnosis of PE from 186 hospitals in Pennsylvania. We used random-intercept logistic regression to assess the independent association between WBC count levels at the time of presentation and mortality and hospital readmission within 30 days, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. Patients with an admission WBC count <5.0, 5.0-7.8, 7.9-9.8, 9.9-12.6, and >12.6 Ã 10(9) /L had a cumulative 30-day mortality of 10.9%, 6.2%, 5.4%, 8.3%, and 16.3% (P < 0.001), and a readmission rate of 17.6%, 11.9%, 10.9%, 11.5%, and 15.0%, respectively (P < 0.001). Compared with patients with a WBC count 7.9-9.8 Ã 10(9) /L, adjusted odds of 30-day mortality were significantly greater for patients with a WBC count <5.0 Ã 10(9) /L (odds ratio [OR] 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-2.03), 9.9-12.6 Ã 10(9) /L (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26-1.91), or >12.6 Ã 10(9) /L (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.83-2.69), respectively. The adjusted odds of readmission were also significantly increased for patients with a WBC count <5.0 Ã 10(9) /L (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07-1.68) or >12.6 Ã 10(9) /L (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10-1.51). In patients presenting with PE, WBC count is an independent predictor of short-term mortality and hospital readmission."
CD010864,0,20945815,0,Right ventricular myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism differential diagnosis--a challenge for the clinician.,"It is frequently recognized in medical literature as well as in daily clinical practice that right ventricular myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism are two of the most challenging clinical pictures to differentiate in cardiology and the treatment, often chosen upon a mixture of clinical suspicion criteria subsequently confirmed by other diagnostic methods, can lead to therapeutic success. Differential diagnosis is often difficult due to similar clinical picture, unspecific electrocardiographic changes and unspecific biological markers. It is very important to know the risk factors and the associated comorbidities for these two clinical entities in order to be able to interpret them contextually. In most cases the diagnosis key is the clinical suspicion. Usually in evaluating these cases we are in the position of choosing more complex diagnostic procedures, most likely not available in Emergency Department. In conclusion it is expected from the clinician to use the available methods with a thorough approach to details but in the same time considering the whole clinical picture."
CD010864,0,21705674,0,Endothelin-mediated in vivo pressor responses following TRPV1 activation.,"Transient receptor potential vanilliod 1 (TRPV1) channels have recently been postulated to play a role in the vascular complications/consequences associated with diabetes despite the fact that the mechanisms through which TRPV1 regulates vascular function are not fully known. Accordingly, our goal was to define the mechanisms by which TRPV1 channels modulate vascular function and contribute to vascular dysfunction in diabetes. We subjected mice lacking TRPV1 [TRPV1((-/-))], db/db, and control C57BLKS/J mice to in vivo infusion of the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin or the Î±-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE) to examine the integrated circulatory actions of TRPV1. Capsaicin (1, 10, 20, and 100 Î¼g/kg) dose dependently increased MAP in control mice (5.7 Â± 1.6, 11.7 Â± 2.1, 25.4 Â± 3.4, and 51.6 Â± 3.9%), which was attenuated in db/db mice (3.4 Â± 2.1, 3.9 Â± 2.1, 7.0 Â± 3.3, and 17.9 Â± 6.2%). TRPV1((-/-)) mice exhibited no changes in MAP in response to capsaicin, suggesting the actions of this agonist are specific to TRPV1 activation. Immunoblot analysis revealed decreased aortic TRPV1 protein expression in db/db compared with control mice. Capsaicin-induced responses were recorded following inhibition of endothelin A and B receptors (ET(A) /ET(B)). Inhibition of ET(A) receptors abolished the capsaicin-mediated increases in MAP. Combined antagonism of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors did not further inhibit the capsaicin response. Cultured endothelial cell exposure to capsaicin increased endothelin production as shown by an endothelin ELISA assay, which was attenuated by inhibition of TRPV1 or endothelin-converting enzyme. TRPV1 channels contribute to the regulation of vascular reactivity and MAP via production of endothelin and subsequent activation of vascular ET(A) receptors. Impairment of TRPV1 channel function may contribute to vascular dysfunction in diabetes."
CD010864,0,23103729,0,Comparison of empirical estimate of clinical pretest probability with the Wells score for diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.,"Wells score has been validated for estimation of pretest probability in patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In clinical practice, many clinicians prefer to use empirical estimation rather than Wells score. However, which method is better to increase the accuracy of clinical evaluation is not well understood. Our present study compared empirical estimation of pretest probability with the Wells score to investigate the efficiency of empirical estimation in the diagnostic process of DVT. Five hundred and fifty-five patients were enrolled in this study. One hundred and fifty patients were assigned to examine the interobserver agreement for Wells score between emergency and vascular clinicians. The other 405 patients were assigned to evaluate the pretest probability of DVT on the basis of the empirical estimation and Wells score, respectively, and plasma D-dimer levels were then determined in the low-risk patients. All patients underwent venous duplex scans and had a 45-day follow up. Weighted Cohen's Îº value for interobserver agreement between emergency and vascular clinicians of the Wells score was 0.836. Compared with Wells score evaluation, empirical assessment increased the sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index, positive likelihood ratio, and positive and negative predictive values, but decreased negative likelihood ratio. In addition, the appropriate D-dimer cutoff value based on Wells score was 175 Î¼g/l and 108 patients were excluded. Empirical assessment increased the appropriate D-dimer cutoff point to 225 Î¼g/l and 162 patients were ruled out. Our findings indicated that empirical estimation not only improves D-dimer assay efficiency for exclusion of DVT but also increases clinical judgement accuracy in the diagnosis of DVT."

Don't rely on the D-dimer test!].,"The reliability of D-dimer (NycoCard D-dimer) and CRP (C-reactive protein) tests to exclude suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) was investigated in 116 patients. Venography, ultrasonography or ventilation-perfusion lung scanning was used as the control method in 95, 5, and 14 patients, respectively, and pulmonary angiography in two patients, one of whom also underwent lung scanning, the other venography. Of the 116 patients, 52 had thromboembolism (46 DVT and 6 PE). The respective sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values (NPV, PPV) were 94%, 27%, 85% and 51% for the D-dimer test, and 80%, 53% 76% and 60% for the CRP test. As venous thromboembolism is a life-threatening condition, the NPV of an exclusion test must lie very close to 100 per cent, and thus the study showed neither the D-dimer nor the CRP test to be a satisfactory exclusion test for use in cases of suspected DVT or PE."

CD010864,0,11127496,0,Serum anti-p53 autoantibodies from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis associated with lung cancer.,"Mutations of the tumour suppressor gene p53 lead to accumulation of the mutated p53 protein and subsequent production of antoantibodies against p53 proteins, which are also detected in lung cancer. Lung cancer is frequently associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Therefore, we hypothesized that there might be a relationship between the p53 mutation and high prevalence of lung cancer in IPF. To test this hypothesis, we measured serum p53 antibody levels by an ELISA in various lung diseases including lung cancer (n=98), IPF (n=46; with lung cancer, n=14 and without lung cancer, n=32), pulmonary emphysema (PE, n=23) and healthy controls (HC, n=93). The median values of the serum anti-p53 antibody in each group were 8.78, 9.18, 8.08 and 4.95 for patients with lung cancer, IPF with lung cancer, IPF without lung cancer and PE, respectively, and 2.2 for the healthy control group. The groups of IPF (with and without lung cancer) showed a similar level of median values to the lung cancer group and a tendency for a higher level than the PE group. When the cut-off value was set at 7.7 according to the 95% specificity level for normal control, the incidence of positive anti-p53 antibody was significantly higher in lung cancer (61.2%), IPF with lung cancer (57.1%) and IPF without lung cancer (53.1%) than PE (21.7%). These results suggest that p53 mutations occur frequently and substantially in IPF, resulting in a high prevalence of lung cancer."

In-hospital mortality from PE was 0% (0 of 222) with D-dimer <5000 ng/mL compared with 2.9% (2 of 70) with D-dimer â¥5000 ng/mL (P = .06). In-hospital all-cause mortality was 2.3% (5 of 222) with D-dimer <5000 ng/mL compared with 2.9% (2 of 70) with D-dimer â¥5000 ng/mL (NS). Markedly elevated levels of D-dimer, therefore, did not indicate a high mortality from PE or all-cause mortality during hospitalization."
CD010864,0,19349075,0,The induction of a catabolic phenotype in human primary osteoblasts and osteocytes by polyethylene particles.,"Polyethylene (PE) wear particles are associated with the osteolysis seen in aseptic loosening that leads to orthopaedic implant failure. While cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage are implicated, evidence is now emerging that osteoblastic cells may also be affected by PE. In this study we investigated the effect of PE particles on osteoblasts, using a novel in vitro cell culture system that was developed to juxtapose cells and PE particles, replicating the 3-dimensional (3D) environment near implants. This system allowed normal human bone-derived cells (NHBC) to undergo differentiation into a mature osteocyte-like phenotype over a 21-28-day culture period. PE particles induced an increase in mRNA expression of the osteocyte markers E11, DMP-1 and SOST/sclerostin. NHBC responded to PE particles by increasing the mRNA expression of several genes associated with osteoclast formation and activity (RANKL, IL-8 and M-CSF) and decreased the expression of the osteoclast antagonist, OPG. PE also appeared to induce a switch in the RUNX2 control of gene expression from that of promoting matrix production (type I collagen) to inducing the expression of pro-osteoclastogenic genes. These results suggest that PE particles switch mature osteoblastic cells from an anabolic to a more catabolic phenotype. This concept was further supported by the finding that PE-induced expression of RANKL mRNA in the mouse osteocyte cell line, MLO-Y4. Overall, our results suggest that PE particles directly induce a change in the phenotype of mature osteoblasts and osteocytes, consistent with the net loss of bone near orthopaedic implants."

Peripheral venous blood was drawn from 15 patients with severe preeclampsia (PE group) and 20 normal pregnant women (control group) to prepare monocytes which were then treated with LXA(4) at different concentrations of 0, 10, 100 nmol/L respectively. IL-1Î² level in the supernatant of monocytes was detected by enzyme linked immunoassay. The [Ca(2+)](i) of monocytes was measured by laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results showed that the IL-1Î² level and the [Ca(2+)](i) of monocytes in the PE group were significantly higher than those in the control group. LXA(4) significantly decreased the generation of IL-1Î² in a dose-dependent manner in the PE group. After treatment with 100-nmol/L LXA(4), in the PE group, the [Ca(2+)](i) concentration of monocytes was significantly reduced.

Platelets were analyzed with Spectrum III (Ortho) flow cytometer. In healthy control, the percentage of platelets positive for anti-CD62P was 0.16 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SD)%. Abnormal levels of CD62P were observed in 5 patients with unstable angina, 6 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 1 patient with old myocardial infarction, and 2 patients with mitral stenosis. These results show that activated platelets may play some roles in pathogenesis of heart disease though it is not fully clear yet."
CD010864,0,15497464,0,Odd-numbered long-chain fatty acids in erythrocyte phospholipids as long-term follow-up parameter in propionic acidemia.,"Odd-numbered long-chain fatty acids (OLCFAs) increase in total erythrocyte lipids or plasma in patients with propionic acidemia and have been proposed as a useful parameter of metabolic control. However, up to now no parameter for long-term metabolic control has been available for this disorder. In contrast to previous investigations, we investigated OLCFAs with particular reference to differences for two phospholipid fractions of erythrocyte lipids. The phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) fraction of erythrocyte lipids has a slow turnover rate and might reflect the metabolic propionyl-CoA burden over a period of some weeks. Distinct increases in OLCFA of up to 200% in the phosphatidylcholine fraction were observed after episodes of metabolic decompensation and maximum OLCFA levels were found 3 weeks after the onset of a crisis. As a sign of poor metabolic control, OLCFA levels in PE steadily increased after recurrent episodes of decompensation, but not in clinically stable patients. However, in one patient with clinically good metabolic control, OLCFAs continually increased after the second year of life for an as yet unknown reason. In conclusion, data from this study indicate the usefulness of OLCFA analysis in the PE fraction of erythrocyte lipids, in particular with regard to the need for such a parameter for evidence-based improvement of management strategies in propionic acidemia."
CD010864,0,10579680,0,"Conjugation of an anti-B-cell lymphoma monoclonal antibody, LL2, to long-circulating drug-carrier lipid emulsions.","Long-circulating submicron lipid emulsions, stabilized with poly(ethylene glycol)-modified phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE), are promising drug carriers with substantial capacity for solubilization of lipophilic anticancer agents. This study describes the conjugation of the anti-B-cell lymphoma monoclonal antibody LL2 to the surface of lipid-emulsion globules by use of a novel poly(ethylene glycol)-based heterobifunctional coupling agent. The efficiency of coupling of LL2 to the lipid emulsion was 85% (approx.) and essentially independent of the LL2/emulsion particle ratio and amount of surface-bound PEG-PE. Results from sucrose-gradient centrifugation and Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration indicated stable binding of the antibody to the emulsion. The immunoreactivity of the emulsion-LL2 conjugates was tested with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated LL2 against a monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody, WN. The binding of the conjugates to WN increased with increasing surface density of LL2 up to 40 monoclonal antibodies/emulsion particle, and exceeded that for the free monoclonal antibody (approx. 20 molecules/particle). Results from competitive-binding ELISA were indicative of similar displacement curves for free LL2 and emulsion-LL2 conjugates. Direct cellular ELISA revealed similar binding of emulsion-LL2 complexes to three types of Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, Raji, Ramos and Daudi. The results from this study indicate that emulsion-LL2 complexes might be a useful drug-carrier system for more specific delivery of anticancer drugs to B-cell malignancy."
CD010864,0,10949636,0,[CBO guideline 'Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; revision of the earlier guidelines. Dutch Organization for Quality Assurance in Hospitals].,"Diagnosis of clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis is based on a clinical score, serial compression ultrasonography and D-dimer assay. For the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism perfusion scintigraphy, ventilation scintigraphy, echography of the leg veins and pulmonary angiography in that order lead to the lowest mortality, morbidity and costs. Diagnostics with spiral CT followed by pulmonary angiography leads to equal mortality and fewer angiography procedures. Decision rules based on anamnesis, physical examination, blood gas analysis and chest radiograph have proved to be insufficiently reliable. The present D-dimer assays have too little sensitivity and too much variability. Thrombo-prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin is indicated for general surgery, joint replacement of the knee or hip, cranial and spinal surgery, subarachnoid haemorrhage after surgical treatment of an aneurysm, acute myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke or spinal cord lesion, intensive care patients, patients with acute paralysis due to a neuromuscular disorder, and bedridden patients with a risk factor. Prophylaxis has to be continued as long as the indication exists. In the acute phase of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism treatment with (low-molecular-weight) heparin in an adequate dose is necessary. When started at the same time as coumarin derivatives the treatment with heparin has to be continued for at least 5 days. The risk of postthrombotic syndrome after deep venous thrombosis will be lowered by carrying compression stockings for at least 2 years after the event."
CD010864,0,21074265,0,Protein composition of microparticles shed from human placenta during placental perfusion: Potential role in angiogenesis and fibrinolysis in preeclampsia.,"Shedding of syncytiotrophoblast microparticles (MPs) from placenta to maternal blood occurs in normal pregnancy and is enhanced during preeclampsia (PE). The syncytiotrophoblast synthesizes plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs) which regulate fibrinolysis, as well as soluble forms of the fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt-1) and endoglin, which exert anti-angiogenic actions. An increase in the ratio of PAI-1/PAI-2 and elevated levels of sFlt-1 and sEng in maternal serum are linked to placental damage and maternal endothelial cell dysfunction in PE. The goal of the current study was to determine whether MPs released to maternal perfusate during dual perfusion contain these factors associated with placental pathophysiology in PE. Initially, high levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and Annexin V binding were found in MPs isolated by sequential centrifugation of maternal perfusates at 10,000 and 150,000Ãg(10Â K and 150Â K MPs), indicating their plasma membrane origin. ELISA revealed the presence of these factors at the following relative levels: Eng>PAI-2âPAI-1>sFlt-1. Based on comparisons of their concentration in perfusates, MPs, and MP-free 150Â K supernatants, we determined that MPs constitute a significant portion of Eng released by placenta. Flow cytometric analysis of 10Â K MPs supported the levels of expression found by ELISA and indicated that Eng and PAI-2 were almost exclusively localized to the surface of MPs, a site with biological potential. These results indicate that MPs shed from the syncytial surface express factors which may alter the fibrinolytic and angiogenic balance at the maternal-fetal interface and play a role in the pathophysiology of PE."

In 23 healthy, young females low plasma levels were found (mean 47 ng/ml). In 12 patients with deep vein thrombosis, moderately elevated levels (mean 593 ng/ml) were seen. Higher levels were found in 6 patients with pulmonary embolism (mean 3,337 ng/ml). The highest values occurred in 4 patients with severe intravascular coagulation (31,000 to 390,000 ng/ml). In 22 patients with ovarian cancer and in 21 patients with other gynecologic carcinoma, normal to highly elevated levels of D dimer like material were found. These values corresponded well to concentrations of tumor marker CA 125, measured in the same samples, and to tumor activities staged in these patients based on clinical examinations. Very high values of crosslinked fibrin derivatives (75,000-525,000 ng/ml) were determined in ascitic fluid of patients with ovarian cancer."

CD010864,0,11112122,0,Diagnostic value of arterial blood gas measurement in suspected pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and lethal yet treatable condition. Several authors have reported on the diagnostic value of combinations of arterial blood gas (ABG) and other clinical data (i. e., prediction rules), and have claimed that these combinations can be safely used to exclude PE. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the diagnostic value of ABG measurement and to attempt to validate the ABG prediction rules published by these various authors for the assessment of patients with suspected PE. Two hundred ninety-three consecutive patients referred for imaging to investigate suspected PE were approached to participate in the investigation. ABG and other clinical data were obtained from consenting and eligible patients before an outcome classification (PE versus non-PE) was performed. None of the ABG data or prediction rules had sufficient negative predictive value, specificity, or likelihood ratios to be useful in the management of patients with suspected PE. We conclude that ABG data alone or in combination with other clinical data are not useful in the assessment of suspected PE."
CD010864,0,11510101,0,[A case of acute pulmonary embolism associated with squatting].,"The patient was a 69-year-old man with a 3-year history of diabetes mellitus accompanied by cerebral infarction and arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower extremities. After squatting to clean a car, the patient began to experience dyspnea. A blood gas analysis was performed upon admission, and the patient's PaCO2 and PaO2 levels were found to be low. Examination of a blood sample revealed elevated FDP, FDP-D dimer and platelet factor 4 levels. A perfusion lung scan showed multiple defects in both lungs, but no abnormal findings were detected on a ventilation scan. A pulmonary angiogram showed an interrupted blood flow in branches A9 + 10 of the left pulmonary artery. Accordingly, a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed. Squatting may have caused a partial obstruction of the venous return from the lower extremities by compression of the inguinal region and may have been a predisposing cause of the thrombosis. To our knowledge, such cases of pulmonary embolism triggered by the act of squatting are very rare."

Venous thromboembolic complications happen in less than 1% of untreated patients in whom the presence of venous thrombosis is rejected on the basis of serial ultrasonography or ultrasonography plus either D-dimer or clinical score. Initial anticoagulant treatment (intravenous or subcutaneous heparin) should continue until oral anticoagulant treatment, started concurrently, increases the international normalised ratio above 2.0 for more than 24 h. The optimum duration of oral anticoagulant treatment is unresolved, but may be guided by the presence of temporary or persistent risk factors or presentation with recurrent venous thromboembolism."

CD010864,0,7614060,0,[Value of the determination of D-dimers in the diagnostic approach of venous thrombo-embolic disorders].,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of plasma measurements of D-dimer using ELISA method and latex agglutination test in the diagnostic approach of venous thromboembolism. Among 126 patients suspected of pulmonary embolism (80 pat.) or deep venous thrombosis of the legs (46 pat.), the diagnosis of acute venous thromboembolism has been confirmed using gold standard invasive techniques (pulmonary angiography and/or contrast venography) in 49% of them. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value of a D-dimer plasma concentration above 500 ng/ml, on admission day, for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism are 98%, 66%, 97%, 74% respectively when using the ELISA method, and 87%, 70%, 85%, 74% respectively when using the latex assay. In the 51 patients with a lung scan showing an indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism, the sensitivity of the ELISA method is very high (94%) but that of the latex assay is low (67%). The repetition of D-dimer measurement on days 2 and 4 following admission has no significant effect on the sensitivity of the ELISA and latex assays. Our results demonstrate that the measurement of plasma D-dimer concentration using latex assay should not be used in the diagnostic approach of venous thromboembolism because the sensitivity of this test is insufficient for ruling out the presence of the disease. On the opposite, a low concentration of plasma D-dimer measured by the ELISA method might be used to rule out acute venous thromboembolism, and avoid invasive radiological techniques, especially in patients with an indeterminate probability lung scan."

CD010864,0,21371407,0,Neuroendocrine activation and diagnostics in pulmonary embolism: Translational studies.,"Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a severe and potentially fatal disease which acutely augments the right ventricle (RV) strain. Development of RV dysfunction (RVD) in the disease process is synonymous with an overall poor prognosis. The diagnosis of PE is usually established by a combination of clinical assessment, D-dimer test and medical imaging with either lung scintigraphy or pulmonary multidetector computer tomography (MDCT) angiography. Which of the two methods to use in PE diagnostic has not been determined and very limited data comparing these modalities are available. Assessment of RV function is cumbersome due to complex geometry. RVD is usually established by echocardiography which is observer dependent, has low reproducibility, and requires expertise. Therefore, a simple and reproducible biochemical method to assess RVD in patients with PE would be desirable. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP), cardiac troponin I (TnI), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) have been the most studied plasma biomarkers in the context of risk stratification in PE. BNP is mainly produced in the ventricles of the heart. It is released from the left ventricle in response to increased filling pressure and is increased in chronic left heart failure. Pro-ANP is primarily produced in the atria, is released by atrial distention and is elevated in chronic pulmonary hypertension and could be an early marker for RVD. Plasma level of ET-1 has been shown to correlate with pulmonary pressure and is released from endothelial cells in the pulmonary vessels. Additionally, increases in circulating levels of ET-1 have been reported in an experimental animal model of PE. TnI is part of a complex of regulatory proteins in the cardiac myofilaments and is released upon myocyte injury. It is related to short term clinical outcome, prolonged hypotension, and cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction and is a predictor of 30-day mortality and RVD using echocardiography in patients with PE. Our hypothesis was therefore that the neuroendocrine activation of BNP, pro-ANP, ET-1, and TnI alone or in combination could serve as markers of RVD in patients with PE. The use of plasma biomarkers would be much simpler than reproducible medical imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radionuclide based methods etc."

CD010864,0,17635707,0,Integrated strategies for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.,"Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is an important medical problem because of the high fatality rate from PE and the large number of cases not diagnosed before causing death. Over the last decade, there has been considerable research into the diagnostic process. It is widely accepted that venous ultrasound imaging is an accurate test for the diagnosis of DVT and is the imaging test of choice. For PE, computer tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is replacing ventilation perfusion lung scanning. Technology for CTPA is rapidly evolving and multi-row detector scans have quite reasonable sensitivity and specificity. Despite the accuracy of imaging tests, the post-test probability of disease is highly dependent on pretest probability. Clinical evaluation tools have developed that enable us to accurately categorize patients' risk prior to diagnostic imaging. One advantage of this characterization is an ability to exclude the diagnosis of DVT or PE if clinical probability is sufficiently low and when the D-dimer is negative. There are now a number of D-dimer assays that have well-defined specificities and sensitivities, which enable use in conjunction with clinical probability. A careful combination of clinical assessment, D-dimer and imaging enables safe PE rule out protocols without imaging, an ability to suspect false positive imaging results, and more accurate determination of true positive imaging. These integration strategies result in safer, more convenient and cost-effective care for patients."
CD010864,0,9220630,0,Studies of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus infection in avian species.,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a recently recognized virus of swine. As a newly emerging virus, much of the basic information regarding PRRSV is in the process of discovery. We report three experiments with PRRSV in birds, and a fourth experiment to evaluate the infectivity and transmissibility of avian-derived PRRSV in swine. Experiment 1 compared the susceptibility of Muscovy ducks, Mallard ducks, guinea fowl, and chickens to PRRSV. Birds were exposed to PRRSV (ATCC VR-2402) in drinking water and virus isolation was attempted from feces collected from cages. Based on the duration of fecal shedding of the virus, this experiment showed that Mallard ducks were particularly susceptible to PRRSV. Experiment 2 was done in mallards to corroborate and augment the observations of experiment 1. Virus was isolated from pooled mallard feces up to 25 days post exposure (PE) and from the intestinal contents of 8 of 20 birds euthanized on day 38 PE. No gross or microscopic lesions were observed in ducks collected between 0 and 15 days PE. Experiment 3 evaluated the infectivity and transmissibility of mallard-derived PRRSV in mallards. A cage of mallards orally exposed to PRRSV shed the virus in feces. Exposure of a second cage of mallards to feces from the first cage resulted in fecal shedding of PRRSV by birds in cage two. In turn, exposure to feces from the second cage led to fecal shedding by mallards in a third cage. Experiment 4 assessed the infectivity and transmissibility of mallard-derived virus in swine. Pigs intranasally exposed to PRRSV isolaed from mallard feces in experiment 2 became viremic, seroconverted by ELISA, and transmitted the virus to sentinel swine. Collectively, these studies show that the possibility exists for avian species to be involved in the epidemiology of PRRSV. This is the first report of PRRSV infection in a species other than swine."

Controlled trials have established the efficacy of indefinite-duration anticoagulation, even if the therapy used is a novel agent that is not a coumarin derivative. The PREVENT, ELATE, and THRIVE III trials demonstrate that a strategy of long-term anticoagulation in patients with idiopathic VTE, including those with isolated calf deep vein thrombosis, is safe and effective. This successful strategy appears beneficial across all subgroups, regardless of the presence of an identified thrombophilic state. These include both young and old patients of both sexes, those with factor V Leiden or the prothrombin gene mutation, and those with first-time or recurrent VTE. Thus, the default strategy for idiopathic VTE should be universal anticoagulation unless contraindicated. Implementing this proven approach on a population basis would enable prevention of VTE recurrence with minimal individualization of treatment. Because lifelong therapy can exact a psychological and medical cost on the patient as well as the health care provider, future research should be directed to risk stratification of those most susceptible to recurrence. Avenues of investigation currently being evaluated include measurement of d-dimer levels, examination of residual venous thrombosis on ultrasound, and application of risk nomograms."

CD010864,0,11470974,0,Pleural effusion due to pulmonary emboli.,"Pulmonary embolism is the fourth leading cause of pleural effusion. The possibility of pulmonary embolus should be evaluated for all patients who have undiagnosed pleural effusion. The mechanism of pleural effusion caused by pulmonary embolus is usually increased interstitial fluid in the lungs as a result of ischemia or the release of vasoactive cytokines. Approximately 75% of patients with pulmonary emboli and pleural effusion have pleuritic chest pain. The most common cause of pleuritic chest pain and pleural effusion in patients under 40 years old is pulmonary emboli. Pleural effusion resulting from a pulmonary embolus usually occupies less than one-third of the hemithorax. Dyspnea is frequently out of proportion to the size of the pleural effusion. Pleural fluid caused by pulmonary emboli is usually exudative but is occasionally transudative. d-Dimer testing is a good screen for pulmonary emboli. If d-dimer results are positive, then a spiral computed tomograph should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. Low-molecular-weight-heparin has become the initial treatment of choice for patients with pulmonary emboli and pleural effusion."
CD010864,0,7579402,0,Autoantibodies to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) recognize a kininogen-PE complex.,"Demonstration of autoimmune antiphospholipid antibodies (aPA) to negatively charged phospholipids (PL) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) requires the presence of certain phospholipid-binding plasma proteins, eg, beta 2-glycoprotein I. We found a requirement for plasma against the electrically neutral or zwitterionic phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Two of these PE-binding plasma proteins were identified as high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK). We studied anti-PE antibody (aPE) seropositive plasma from 13 patients with SLE and/or recurrent spontaneous abortions by using partially purified kininogens and kininogen binding proteins from adult bovine serum isolated by carboxymethyl (CM)-papain affinity chromatography. Eleven of 13 sera recognized a kininogen-PE complex and/or a kininogen-binding protein-kininogen-PE complex. Some aPE-positive patient sera were shown to recognize highly purified HMWK and LMWK by ELISA only when the kininogens were presented on a PE substrate. These aPE sera did not recognize PE, HMWK, or LMWK when they were presented independently as the sole antigens on the ELISA plates. Other aPE-positive sera that did not react with PE-bound HMWK or LMWK reacted with the CM-papain column eluate when it was bound to PE, which suggests that these aPE recognize factor XI or prekallikrein, which normally bind to HMWK. The aPE ELISA reactivity of two patient sera were inhibited by preincubation of the CM-papain column eluate in the ELISA plate. These data show that most aPE are not specific for PE but require the presence of certain PL-binding plasma proteins that are kininogens or proteins in complex with kininogens. Our studies indicate that aPE bind to different plasma proteins than those implicated in anionic PL, aPA ELISA reactivity."

CD010864,0,19725008,0,From dyspnea to pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is often evoked in patients with new-onset or worsening dyspnea, especially when it is associated with pleuritic chest pain. However, the prevalence of PE in patients with a clinical suspicion ranges from 20 % to as low as 5 %. Unfortunately, what exactly constitutes a clinical suspicion of PE in a patient with dyspnea can not be accurately standardized. The presence of risk factors for venous thromboembolism should prompt the search for PE. However, their absence does not rule out PE as the cause of the patient's symptoms, since around 30 % of patients with a first episode of PE have no risk or precipitating factors. Once PE is suspected, the diagnostic workup can be standardized and based on a large body of evidence, combining clinical assessment by a prediction rule, D-dimer measurement and CT angiography in patients with an elevated D-dimer level or a high clinical probability of PE. Patients with obvious alternative diagnoses such as acute left heart failure, pneumonia or acute coronary syndrome should not be investigated for PE."

We also investigated the association of pleural INF-gamma and sIL-2R levels with development of residual pleural thickening (RPT). The subjects in this study included patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis with or without PE (n = 46), those with nontuberculous PE (n = 32), and healthy tuberculin reactors (n = 20). Measurement of IFN-gamma and sIL-2R were made by ELISA. In pulmonary tuberculosis, IFN-gamma and sIL-2R concentrations in PBMC culture supernatants were lower than those of healthy tuberculin reactors (IFN-gamma; 258.4 +/-111.5 pg/mL versus 2792.5 +/-633.2 pg/mL, sIL-2R; 1465.0 +/-144.4 pg/mL versus 4777.1 +/-178.5 pg/mL, p < 0.05), whereas IFN-gamma and sIL-2R concentrations in PE were higher than those from nontuberculous pleural effusion (IFN-gamma; 1154.4 +/-252.4 pg/mL versus 292.0 +/-68.9 pg/mL, sIL-2R; 9805.2 +/-978.9 pg/mL versus 3426.7 +/-695.6 g/mL, p < 0.05). IFN-gamma and sIL-2R in PBMC culture supernatants were significantly lower in tuberculat patients with PE than those without PE, and the patients with a high value of IFN-gamma or sIL-2R in PE showed a low value of IFN-gamma or sIL-2R in PBMC culture supernatant, respectively. Patients with RPT had significantly higher IFN-gamma and sIL-2R values in their PE compared with those without RPT. These findings suggest that diminished systemic Th1 response in tuberculosis results from the accumulation of activated Th1 cell to the disease site, and that levels of IFN-gamma and sIL-2R in PE are useful posttreatment markers of RPT."

The fibrinolytic effect of UK was evaluated by a combination of clinical and laboratory findings (score), isotopic perfusion defect and A-a DO2. Prominent recovery was observed in 60% cases of the UK48 and UK60 groups but none in the UK24 group. Fibrin degradation products (FDP) D and D-D increased significantly when alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor (alpha 2PI) decreased to less than 3 mg/dl. These results suggest that fibrinolytic therapy of PTE can be evaluated objectively using noninvasive examinations and UK treatment is successful when 48 or 60 x 10(4) U. of UK is administered over 6 hrs and a 50% decrease of alpha 2PI is obtained."

As monoclonal antibodies (Mab) are widely used as cellular probes, and are likely to constitute the future basis for immunodifferentials, we explored the feasibility of implementing immunofluorescence on this routine haematology analyser. An extensive series of Mab (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD22, CD33, CD34, CD41, CD42b, CD45, CD56, CD61, CD64, CD235a and HLA-DR) were tested singly or in FITC/PE combinations. Analyser processing and data acquisition was achieved using CD-Sapphire automated CD61 immunoplatelet or CD3/4/8 assay procedures and, apart from mixing EDTA-blood and antibody, no further sample manipulation was required. Downloaded raw files were processed with cytometry software, and all evaluated reagents showed population discrimination analogous to flow cytometry. Practical procedures were straightforward and required minimal operator training. Extended information that can be obtained from monoclonal antibodies with a routine haematology analyser has the potential to extend haematology laboratory practices and positively impact laboratory and clinical efficiency."

CD010864,0,10907442,0,[Diagnostic strategies for pulmonary embolism and decision analysis].,"Decision analysis has greatly benefited to the field of pulmonary embolism diagnosis, by allowing the theoretical assessment of potential novel strategies, which could in turn be validated in clinical trials. The adjunction of clinical probability assessment, plasma D-dimer measurement, and lower limb venous compression ultrasonography, to pulmonary scintigraphy and angiography in the diagnostic workup, results in a considerable reduction in the requirement for angiography. Moreover, these strategies are highly cost-effective, yielding cost savings without increasing morbidity or mortality. Such diagnostic algorithms are safe, as demonstrated by clinical outcome studies. Finally, spiral CTscan combined with D-dimer and ultrasonography could also prove highly cost-effective, and replace either pulmonary angiography, or even both lung scan and angiography, if ongoing studies confirm the promising preliminary results obtained with CTscan. However, such a conclusion awaits the validation of algorithms including CTscan by clinical outcome trials, in which the therapeutic decision would rest on the result of the spiral CTscan."

Ventilation perfusion lung scan, the standard diagnostic test for PE, has poor overall sensitivity. The gold standard examination, pulmonary angiography, is invasive and has some risk, making clinicians reluctant to refer patients. In recent years, new diagnostic modalities have been investigated, including D-Dimer assays, spiral computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The authors reviewed the literature and noted that the D-Dimer assays by ELISA or rapid ELISA design are approximately 90% to 95% sensitive, but are not specific for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Spiral CT has been studied with conflicting results; however, in the largest studies the reported sensitivities are greater than approximately 85%. Electron beam CT is an alternative technique, which has not been as extensively studied. MRI is also useful for imaging the pulmonary arterial vasculature, but remains experimental. Although a more accurate assessment of the sensitivity of these new modalities will need to wait until a large angiographically controlled study, such as the planned PIOPED II, can be done, D-Dimer assay and spiral CT are often useful in the detection of pulmonary embolism. The authors make recommendations for their use in a diagnostic algorithm, as alternatives to the standard ventilation perfusion lung scan."
CD010864,0,20700914,0,High-throughput phospholipidic fingerprinting by online desorption of dried spots and quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometry: evaluation of atherosclerosis biomarkers in mouse plasma.,"This work presents a strategy for the evaluation of differences in plasma phospholipid content between atherosclerotic and healthy mice from micro volumes (2 microL) spotted on filter paper. Dried plasma spots (DPS) were directly desorbed into a triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer using a homemade prototype, ensuring high-throughput analysis of dried spots without any sample pretreatment. Multiple positive and negative neutral loss and precursor ion scans were simultaneously acquired in a single loop, allowing oriented fingerprinting until 2700 potential species including phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), and sphingomyelin (SM) classes. The phospholipidic variations between 15 healthy and 15 atherosclerotic mice were evaluated using t tests, matrix reduction and merging, and principal component analysis (PCA) as a chemometric statistical approach. The discriminating ions in PCA analysis were qualitatively identified in an information dependent acquisition (IDA) manner using enhanced resolution and enhanced product ion scans. PCA demonstrates a clear clustering between healthy and diseased mice. Regarding the most relevant variables identified, this procedure has confirmed the role of SM and PS classes in atherosclerosis and has established potential biomarkers shown to be significantly up- or down-regulated with the disease. The results presented in this work demonstrate the sample processing and analysis potential of the developed strategy to evaluate new biomarkers and the state of a disease."

Fifty-four patients (16 male and 38 female) with a history of chest pain requiring medical care were selected: 33 were in the cyanosis (+) group, and 21 were in the cyanosis (-) group. Medical records were reviewed. The causes of chest pain were (no. cyanosis [+], no. cyanosis [-], respectively) as follows: idiopathic (n = 19, n = 10), pulmonary hemorrhage (n = 6, n = 0), pulmonary tuberculosis (n = 2, n = 0), pulmonary thromboembolism (n = 4, n = 0), localized musculoskeletal (n = 1, n = 1), myocardial ischemia (n = 1, n = 1), and arrhythmia (n = 2, n = 9).

Using a monoclonal antibody (PE-10) against surfactant protein A (SP-A), a positive immunoperoxidase stain was observed over serous cells of submucosal glands in histologic sections of airway walls. Measurement of SP-A in culture medium samples using single-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed a significant secretion of SP-A by isolated submucosal glands (1.2 +/- 0.08 ng/ml/h, SEM, n = 40). In gene expression experiments by reverse transciption-polymerase chain reaction, the SP-A complementary DNA (cDNA) segment was amplified from isolated submucosal glands, indicating the presence of SP-A messenger RNA (mRNA) in airway submucosal glands. Bronchial superficial epithelial cells failed to show the presence of SP-A mRNA. No cDNA segment of SP-B, SP-C, or SP-D cDNA was amplified from isolated submucosal glands or superficial epithelial cells, whereas all were amplified from alveolar tissue. Furthermore, in contrast to the control alveolar tissue, which expressed both SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes, SP-A2 gene transcript alone was detected in isolated submucosal glands by Southern analysis that included the digestion of the amplified SP-A cDNA fragment with the restriction enzyme Apa I. These findings indicate that human airway submucosal gland cells can transcribe the SP-A2 gene and produce SP-A protein in a manner different from peripheral airways and alveoli, playing a role in the airway defense mechanism."

CD010864,0,17895896,0,High incidence of silent venous thromboembolism before treatment in ovarian cancer.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) often occurs after surgery and rarely occurs even before surgery in patients with ovarian cancer. It is well known that levels of plasma D-dimer (DD) before treatment in most ovarian cancer patients are increased. This study therefore examined whether increased levels of DD are associated with presence of VTE before treatment of ovarian cancer. Between November 2004 and March 2007, DD levels prior to initial treatment were measured in 72 consecutive patients with presumed epithelial ovarian cancer (final diagnosis: epithelial ovarian cancer, n=60; and epithelial ovarian borderline malignancy, n=12). Venous ultrasound imaging (VUI) of the lower extremity was conducted for all patients except for two patients in whom DVT was detected by pelvic computed tomography (CT). When DVT was found, pulmonary scintigraphy was subsequently performed to ascertain presence of PTE. D-dimer levels were above the cut-off value (0.5 microg ml(-1)) in 65 of 72 patients (90.2%). Venous ultrasound imaging or CT revealed DVT in 18 of 72 patients (25.0%) and pulmonary scintigraphy found PTE in 8 patients (11.1%). All patients with VTE were asymptomatic when VTE was found. D-dimer levels were associated with incidence of VTE (0-1.4 microg ml(-1); 0 of 26 (0%), 1.5-7.4 microg ml(-1); 9 of 30 (30%) and > or =7.5 microg ml(-1); 9 of 16 (56.3%), P for trend=0.0003). However, even if 1.5 microg ml(-1) was used as a cut-off value, this had low specificity and positive predictive value (47.2, 38.3%), though it had high sensitivity and negative predictive value (100, 100%). Therefore, ovarian cancer patients with DD level > or =1.5 microg ml(-1) should be examined using VUI to detect silent DVT. Patients with VTE underwent preventive managements including anticoagulant therapy before initial treatment, chemotherapy or surgery, and after surgery. There was no clinical onset of postoperative VTE in all 72 patients. Measurement of DD levels and subsequent ultrasonography revealed that silent or subclinical VTE frequently occurs before surgery in ovarian cancer. The usefulness of preoperative assessment of VTE needs further confirmation in randomised controlled trials."

CD010864,0,16855363,0,Acute pulmonary embolism: risk stratification.,"The death rate from acute pulmonary embolism (PE) exceeds the mortality rate for acute myocardial infarction. Risk stratification helps optimize the selection of those patients who will benefit from more aggressive therapy, such as thrombolysis or embolectomy, in addition to anticoagulation. The classic paradigm was to observe patients deteriorate and to attempt to maintain acceptable hemodynamics by starting vasopressors. If hemodynamics failed to improve or if cardiogenic shock persisted, thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy was considered. Sadly, this ""watch and wait"" approach often resulted in irreversible cardiogenic shock and multisystem organ failure. The new approach hinges upon rapid and accurate risk stratification. There are four features of this strategy: 1) clinical evaluation, 2) bedside nonimaging tests-electrocardiography and pulse oximetry, 3) imaging tests-echocardiography and chest computed tomography,and 4) cardiac biomarkers-such as the troponin level. When high-risk patients are identified,they can be triaged for urgent or emergent therapy, usually prior to developing overt hypotension and cardiogenic shock."
CD010864,0,17161451,1,Validation of a new D-dimer microparticle enzyme immunoassay (AxSYM D-Dimer) in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).,The aim of the study was to evaluate a new automated assay for D-dimer testing (AxSYM D-Dimer) based on microparticle enzyme-immunoassay technology by comparing it with three well established D-dimer assays.
CD010864,0,19274539,0,D-dimers as a screening test for venous thromboembolism in pregnancy: is it of any use?,"In non-pregnant women, D-dimers are used successfully to aid diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolus (PE), as they have high sensitivity, moderate specificity and high negative predictive value. However, D-dimer levels are physiologically raised in pregnancy and thus overlap the values normally associated with PE. The aim of this retrospective study therefore was to investigate the use of D-dimer levels as a screening test for suspected PE in pregnancy and to determine if a negative D-dimer level could exclude the diagnosis in pregnant women. A total of 37 women suspected of PE had both ventilation perfusion (VQ) scans and D-dimer levels performed. Thirteen were reported as having a low probability of PE following VQ scan, while 24 were thought to have a moderate or high probability of PE. Women who had a low probability of PE following VQ scanning were found to have D-dimer levels ranging from 0.25-2.2 mg/l, while women who had a high probability of PE following scanning had D-dimer levels ranging from 0.31-1.74 mg/l. The sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer as a test for suspected PE in pregnancy was calculated to be 0.73 and 0.15 respectively, while the negative likelihood ratio was 1.8. Current guidelines advocate the use of a negative D-dimer result to exclude the diagnosis of PE in pregnancy. However, this study suggests that D-dimer testing in pregnancy has a high negative likelihood ratio and should not be used. Larger prospective observational studies are required to collaborate the findings from this study."
CD010864,0,14577295,0,[Haemostatic molecular markers].,"Because a significant number of the deaths caused by acute (massive) pulmonary thromboembolism occur within the hours after the onset of symptoms, its early diagnosis is very important. The gold standard diagnostic tests for venous thromboembolism (VTE), contrast venography and pulmonary angiography, respectively, are invasive, expensive, not readily available, and labor intensive. A diagnostic tool for VTE is needed that is noninvasive and highly accurate, allowing immediate treatment decisions to be made in most cases. D-dimer, a one of haemostatic molecular markers, is specific cross linked fibrin derivatives. This is the most promising blood test for VTE screening. Although elevated concentrations of D-dimers are sensitive for the presence of VTE, they are not specific. They therefore cannot be used to make a positive diagnosis of VTE."
CD010864,0,15850580,0,AIDP and CIDP having specific antibodies to the carbohydrate epitope (-NeuAcalpha2-8NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-4Glc-) of gangliosides.,"Anti-ganglioside antibodies were investigated in plasma exchange solutions (PEs) from two patients with acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies (AIDP and CIDP). Both cases show markedly elevated antibody titers against the lacto-series gangliosides, GM3, GD3, and GT3. In the CIDP patient, the IgG antibody titer to GD3 was remarkably elevated (titer, 1:10,000), indicating maximal avidity to the tetrasaccharide epitope (-NeuAcalpha2-8NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-4Glc-). There were also activities toward GM4 and GM2 with the affinity higher to GM4 than to GM2, indicating that the antibody activity was not highly specific. In contrast, the antibody activities in the AIDP patient showed similar avidity to GM3, GD3, and GT3. These two patients are very rare cases that have not previously encountered in GBS. The effects on co-cultured cells of rat spinal cord and muscle differed according to which PE was used. PE from the AIDP patient produced an inhibitory effect (reduction to 26.8%) on the spontaneous muscle action potential of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), but the PE from the CIDP patient did not. Thus, in AIDP, the common epitope of GM3, GD3, or GT3 may be shared with certain antigens localized in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and may participate in a component of conduction-related molecules in the NMJ. High titers of anti-GD3 antibody and the distortion of antibody recognition found in CIDP seem to have no immediate effect on electrophysiologic function in the PNS."
CD010864,0,22343403,0,ACR Appropriateness CriteriaÂ® acute chest pain--suspected pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a common and important clinical condition that cannot be accurately diagnosed on the basis of signs, symptoms, and history alone. In the absence of high pretest probability and with a negative high-sensitivity D-dimer test, PE can be effectively excluded; in other situations, diagnostic imaging is necessary. The diagnosis of PE has been facilitated by technical advancements and multidetector computed tomography pulmonary angiography, which is the major diagnostic modality currently used. Ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) scans remain largely accurate and useful in certain settings. Lower-extremity ultrasound can substitute by demonstrating deep vein thrombosis; however, if negative, further studies to exclude PE are indicated. In all cases, correlation with the clinical status, particularly with risk factors, improves not only the accuracy of diagnostic imaging but also overall utilization. Other diagnostic tests have limited roles. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The development and review of the guidelines include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment."

CD010864,0,22962929,0,Causes and evaluation of chronic dyspnea.,"Chronic dyspnea is shortness of breath that lasts more than one month. The perception of dyspnea varies based on behavioral and physiologic responses. Dyspnea that is greater than expected with the degree of exertion is a symptom of disease. Most cases of dyspnea result from asthma, heart failure and myocardial ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, or psychogenic disorders. The etiology of dyspnea is multifactorial in about one-third of patients. The clinical presentation alone is adequate to make a diagnosis in 66 percent of patients with dyspnea. Patients' descriptions of the sensation of dyspnea may be helpful, but associated symptoms and risk factors, such as smoking, chemical exposures, and medication use, should also be considered. Examination findings (e.g., jugular venous distention, decreased breath sounds or wheezing, pleural rub, clubbing) may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Initial testing in patients with chronic dyspnea includes chest radiography, electrocardiography, spirometry, complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel. Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide levels may help exclude heart failure, and D-dimer testing may help rule out pulmonary emboli. Pulmonary function studies can be used to identify emphysema and interstitial lung diseases. Computed tomography of the chest is the most appropriate imaging study for diagnosing suspected pulmonary causes of chronic dyspnea. To diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension or certain interstitial lung diseases, right heart catheterization or bronchoscopy may be needed."

CD010864,0,2820988,0,Interactions of target-sensitive immunoliposomes with herpes simplex virus. The foundation of a sensitive immunoliposome assay for the virus.,"Interactions between target-sensitive (TS) immunoliposomes and herpes simplex virus (HSV) were investigated. Target sensitivity of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) immunoliposomes is a result of the ability of acylated monoclonal anti-HSV glycoprotein D (gD) to stabilize the bilayer phase of PE, whereas by itself, PE does not form stable liposomes (Ho, R. J. Y., Rouse, B. T., and Huang, L. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 5500-5506). Upon binding of these immunoliposomes to HSV antigen-containing gD, destabilization of PE immunoliposomes was observed. By encapsulating either a self-quenching fluorescent dye, calcein, or alkaline phosphatase inside the liposomal compartment, the HSV-induced destabilization of TS immunoliposomes was shown to be target-specific. Neither Sendai, Semliki Forest, nor Sindbis virus could significantly destabilize the TS immunoliposomes. Moreover, HSV-induced liposome destabilization could be inhibited by free anti-gD (the same antibody used in TS immunoliposomes) but not by monoclonal anti-HSV glycoprotein B, indicating that the interaction was antigen-specific. Destabilization could also be induced by binding to truncated gD (tgD), but only when in a multivalent form immobilized on latex beads. Truncated gD is a cloned, 312-amino acid fragment of HSV-gD that lacks the transmembrane segment. Preincubation of soluble tgD with the TS immunoliposomes failed to induce destabilization and, in addition, abolished the tgD-bead-induced destabilization. This finding strongly indicated that multivalent binding is essential for TS immunoliposome destabilization. Using alkaline phosphatase encapsulated in the liposomes, TS immunoliposomes could be used to detect HSV in fluid phase with 50% signal recorded at 5 microliters of 3.2 x 10(3) pfu/ml; at least 10-fold more sensitive than the standard double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The interactions described here may be useful in designing a homogeneous and sensitive immunoliposome assay."
CD010864,0,19806479,0,Serum heart type fatty acid binding protein levels in metabolic syndrome.,"Heart type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) is a major cytoplasmic low-molecular weight protein and released into the circulation when the myocardium is injured. Previous studies have demonstrated that H-FABP is closely associated with acute coronary syndrome, hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, stroke, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, pulmonary embolism. The aim of this study was to investigate serum H-FABP value in the patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). We measured serum H-FABP levels in 55 consecutive patients with MetS, and 73 age-matched control subjects by using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum H-FABP levels were significantly higher in patients with MetS than in control subjects 18.37Â Â±Â 13.0 and 7.9Â Â±Â 6.5Â ng/ml, respectively, (PÂ <Â 0.001). Serum H-FABP levels were significantly higher in patients with diabetic MetS than in without diabetic MetS, 24.0Â Â±Â 10.2 and 13.9Â Â±Â 12.6Â ng/ml, respectively, (P: 0,003). There were statistically significant differences between patients without diabetic MetS and control subjects, 13.8Â Â±Â 12.6 and 7.9Â Â±Â 6.5Â ng/ml, respectively, (PÂ =Â 0.023). Patients with MetS have an increased risk of death from cardiovascular diseases. H-FABP seems to be a marker that will enable the detection of cardiac injury in the early asymptomatic period in patients with MetS."
CD010864,0,23184564,0,Mesenchymal markers on human adipose stem/progenitor cells.,"The stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue is a rich source of multipotent stem cells. We and others have described three major populations of stem/progenitor cells in this fraction, all closely associated with small blood vessels: endothelial progenitor cells (EPC, CD45-/CD31+/CD34+), pericytes (CD45-/CD31-/CD146+), and supra-adventitial adipose stromal cells (SA-ASC, CD45-/CD31-/CD146-/CD34+). EPC are luminal, pericytes are adventitial, and SA-ASC surround the vessel like a sheath. The multipotency of the pericytes and SA-ASC compartments is strikingly similar to that of CD45-/CD34-/CD73+/CD105+/CD90+ bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC). Here, we determine the extent to which this mesenchymal pattern is expressed on the three adipose stem/progenitor populations. Eight independent adipose tissue samples were analyzed in a single tube (CD105-FITC/CD73-PE/CD146-PETXR/CD14-PECY5/CD33-PECY5/CD235A-PECY5/CD31-PECY7/CD90-APC/CD34-A700/CD45-APCCY7/DAPI). Adipose EPC were highly proliferative with (14.3 Â± 2.8)% (mean Â± SEM) having >2N DNA. About half (53.1 Â± 7.6)% coexpressed CD73 and CD105, and (71.9 Â± 7.4)% expressed CD90. Pericytes were less proliferative [(8.2 Â± 3.4)% >2N DNA)] with a smaller proportion [(29.6 Â± 6.9)% CD73+/CD105+, (60.5 Â± 10.2)% CD90+] expressing mesenchymal associated markers. However, the CD34+ subset of CD146+ pericytes were both highly proliferative [(15.1 Â± 3.6)% with >2N DNA] and of uniform mesenchymal phenotype [(93.3 Â± 3.7)% CD73+/CD105+, (97.8 Â± 0.7)% CD90+], suggesting transit amplifying progenitor cells. SA-ASC were the least proliferative [(3.7 Â± 0.8)%>2N DNA] but were also highly mesenchymal in phenotype [(94.4 Â± 3.2)% CD73+/CD105+, (95.5 Â± 1.2)% CD90+]. These data imply a progenitor/progeny relationship between pericytes and SA-ASC, the most mesenchymal of SVF cells. Despite phenotypic and functional similarities to BM-MSC, SA-ASC are distinguished by CD34 expression."

CD010864,0,3302621,0,Pulmonary fibrin deposition and increased microvascular permeability to protein following fibrin microembolism in dogs: a structure-function relationship.,"The effects of fibrin microembolism were examined using an infusion of a prothrombin activator (Echis carinatus venom, ECV; 30 min, 0.5 NIH thrombin equivalent units/kg) in acute mongrel dogs prepared with a pulmonary lymph cannula (n = 6, 12.3-21.5 kg). Lymph flow increased approximately 2.5-fold after 1-1.5 hr of elevated left atrial pressure (Pla = 20 cm H2O; 26 +/- 7 to 63 +/- 16 microliter/min, P less than 0.01) and the plasma to lymph protein concentration ratio (CP/CL) declined from 0.66 +/- .04 to 0.54 +/- .16 (P less than 0.01, x +/- SE). After Pla was reduced to control levels, the initiation of fibrin microembolism was associated with an approximate 2.7-fold elevation of lymph flow (62 +/- 8 microliters/min, P less than 0.01) and the CP/CL was not changed (0.56 +/- 0.04, P = ns). When Pla was increased following microembolism, lymph flow more than doubled to 117 +/- 24 microliter/min (P less than 0.01) and the CP/CL remained unaltered (0.56 +/- 0.03, P = ns). These changes were associated with afibrinogenemia and the appearance of fibrin degradation products (FDP) in plasma (150 +/- 50 micrograms/ml) and lymph (80 micrograms/ml) in three of the animals tested. No consistent pattern was seen in the CL/CP of separate endogenous plasma proteins after each intervention. These data support the view that pulmonary fibrin microembolism without inhibition of the fibrinolytic system was associated with an early increased pulmonary microvascular permeability to protein. In a separate group of similarly prepared animals (n = 8, 13-21.5 kg) without a lymph catheter, scanning electron microscopic observations showed branching fibrin microemboli to partially occlude some pulmonary arterioles. Mixed thrombus formations in larger precapillary blood vessels were also seen. Ultrastructural observations revealed the deposition of fibrin strands (periodicity = 220-230 A) within the pulmonary capillaries. Some of these deposits were overlaid by lamellar pseudopodia from endothelial cells and the fibrin appeared to be within these cells. Although plasmalemmal vesicles seemed to be more numerous in the endothelial cells with adjacent fibrin deposits, no gaps or breaks were seen in the densely stained interendothelial cell junctions and/or the endothelial cell membrane of the affected lung capillaries. Activated neutrophils and platelets were more numerous in the pulmonary capillaries following EVC. These data suggest that the presence of FDP and/or fibrin deposits within the pulmonary microvasculature may influence the early functional integrity of pulmonary endothelial cells at sites of fibrin accumulation."

CD010864,0,21987234,0,shRNA targeting Î²1-integrin suppressed proliferative aspects and migratory properties of airway smooth muscle cells.,"Dysfunction of airway smooth muscle (ASM) is an essential feature of airway remodeling in chronic asthma. However, the precise mechanisms of this pathological process have not been well studied. In previous study, we found that Î²1-integrin, which was dramatically upregulated in ASM cells in an asthmatic mouse model, was associated with the cell proliferation. In this study, we employed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Î²1-integrin to assess the effect of down-regulation of this receptor on the proliferative aspects and migratory properties of ASM cells in vitro. The cells were treated with shRNA expression vectors directed against Î²1-integrin, control vectors that included the blank control, empty vector without shRNA, and mismatched shRNA, respectively. The mRNA and protein expressions of Î²1-integrin were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Cell proliferation was measured by BrdU ELISA and cell cycle by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-PE/7-AAD staining. Cell migration assays were evaluated by transwell assay and expression of IL-6 and IL-8 by ELISA. The results revealed that shRNA targeting Î²1-integrin significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expressions of Î²1-integrin, enhanced the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase, decreased the proportion in S phase, promoted cell apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation, migration, IL-6 and IL-8 secretion in vitro. In conclusion, the overexpression of Î²1-integrin in ASM cells is essential for airway dysfunction development because it promotes proliferative aspects and migratory properties of ASM cells. Importantly, shRNA targeting Î²1-integrin may provide a new approach to preventing airway remodeling in chronic asthma."

Hypothalamic content of LHRH and plasma levels of LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P) were measured by RIA methods, and prolactin (PRL) was examined by ELISA in 1) normal four-day cycling rats, 2) saline-treated IC and PE rats, and 3) IC and PE rats treated with sprays of male urine (50 microliters every 10 min for 1 h on only one day, at a distance of 1 cm from the nostrils). Group 1 showed low levels of LHRH and high levels of LH, FSH, E2, P, and PRL in the afternoon of proestrus (PR). In group 2, the pattern was not cyclical and the levels of the hormones were higher than basal for the cyclic rats, except for P, which was lower. Group 3 showed a depletion of the hypothalamic LHRH and an increase in plasma LH, FSH, E2, Pm, and PRL. FSH, E2, and P showed the strongest rise, leading to an elevated ratio of FSH to LH. Four-day estrous cycles reappeared in urine-treated rats on the succeeding days. The cyclic behavior of the PRCA hormones was, qualitatively, the same as in the normally cycling rats. According to the results, the origin of the PRCA effect is an olfactory input to the hypophysiotropic area of the hypothalamus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010864,0,16475039,0,Advances in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.,"This review summarizes recent information about the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) using noninvasive imaging tests, clinical assessment, and D-dimer assays, and describes how these tests can be employed in diagnostic testing algorithms for the investigation of patients with suspected DVT and PE. The clinical diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis is unreliable, but clinical prediction rules based on signs and symptoms do facilitate the categorization of patients into high, low, or medium risk categories. High sensitivity D-dimer assays further help in excluding cases but do not help in ruling in venous thromboembolism. D-dimer assays and clinical prediction rules also help in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. These assessments, along with objective imaging studies such as compression ultrasonography for DVT or computerized tomographic pulmonary angiograms for PE can be used in a systematic way to reliably rule in or exclude venous thromboembolism."
CD010864,0,17003925,0,Prognostic value of D-dimer in patients with pulmonary embolism.,"D-dimer levels appear to be associated with the extent of the thromboembolic burden in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). We therefore hypothesized that D-dimer levels at admission would be associated with prospective risk of mortality in patients with PE. We used data from 366 patients diagnosed with PE at four hospital emergency departments. A highly sensitive D-dimer test was prospectively performed at admission. The outcome was overall mortality within three months. We divided patients into quartiles on the basis of their D-dimer levels and compared mortality rates by quartile. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for mortality in the first and fourth quartile. Overall mortality was 5.2%. Patients who died had higher median D-dimer levels than patients who survived (4578 versus 2946 microg/l; p = 0.005). Mortality increased with increasing D-dimer levels, rising from 1.1% in the first quartile (<1500 microg/l) to 9.1% in the fourth quartile (>5500 microg/l) (P = 0.049). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of D-dimer levels <1500 microg/l to predict mortality were 95%, 26%, 7%, and 99%, respectively. Patients with PE who have D-dimer levels below 1500 microg/l have a very low mortality. Further studies must assess whether D-dimer, alone or combined with other prognostic instruments for PE, can be used to identify low-risk patients with PE who are potential candidates for outpatient treatment or an abbreviated hospital stay."
CD010864,0,23103122,0,Calcitriol downregulates TNF-Î± and IL-6 expression in cultured placental cells from preeclamptic women.,"Placenta is an important source and target of hormones that contribute to immunological tolerance and maintenance of pregnancy. In preeclampsia (PE), placental calcitriol synthesis is low; whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines levels are increased, threatening pregnancy outcome. Previously, we showed that calcitriol inhibits Th-1 cytokines under experimental inflammatory conditions in normal trophoblasts. However, a study of the regulation of inflammatory cytokines by calcitriol in trophoblasts from a natural inflammatory condition, such as PE, is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate calcitriol effects upon TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, IL-6 and IL-1Î² in cultured placental cells from preeclamptic women by using qPCR and ELISA. Placentas were collected after cesarean section from preeclamptic women and enriched trophoblastic preparations were cultured in the absence or presence of different calcitriol concentrations during 24h. In these cell cultures, pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± and IL-6 secretion and mRNA expression were downregulated by calcitriol (P<0.05). No significant effects of calcitriol upon IFN-Î³ and IL-1Î² were observed. In addition, basal expression of TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-1Î² decreased as the cells formed syncytia. Our study supports an important autocrine/paracrine role of placental calcitriol in controlling adverse immunological responses at the feto-maternal interface, particularly in gestational pathologies associated with exacerbated inflammatory responses such as preeclampsia."
CD010864,0,12215387,0,Measurement of changes in mRNA for IL-5 in noninvasive scrapings of nasal epithelium taken from patients undergoing nasal allergen challenge.,"Nasal allergen challenge of patients with allergic rhinitis results in increased numbers of inflammatory cells and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 5 (IL-5). We report a sensitive, noninvasive method to measure changes in the amount of mRNA for IL-5 in nasal epithelium and have used this method to detect alterations of IL-5 mRNA from patients undergoing a nasal allergen challenge. Ten grass or ragweed allergic adults were challenged out of season with appropriate pollen extracts at sufficient dose to give a rhinitis total symptom score of 5 on a scale of 12. After allergen exposure, symptoms were recorded hourly. At 0, 3, and 6 h after allergen exposure, secreted proteins were collected on filter paper strips and two superficial scrapings of nasal epithelium were obtained. The scrapings of epithelium were immediately immersed in 100 microl of RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) and stored at 4 degrees C for up to 1 month without loss of RNA quality. Total RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was performed. cDNA for IL-5 was then measured by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR with Pre-Developed TaqMan Assay Reagents (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sufficient RNA was isolated from eight subjects to measure IL-5 mRNA. Data were normalized for content of ribosomal RNA. The relative amount of cDNA for IL-5 was calculated by comparison with internal standards prepared from phytohemagluttinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Messenger RNA for IL-5 was increased 8.7+/-2.7-fold at 3 h (p<0.01) and 39.5+/-20.9-fold at 6 h (p<0.01). Increased IL-5 mRNA levels at 6 h closely correlate with total symptom scores at 6 h (r=0.88; p=0.007). IL-5 protein was measured by ELISA in eluates from the filter papers. At 6 h, there was increased IL-5 protein (7.7+/-2.8 ng/ml) compared with time zero (1.8+/-0.5 ng/ml) (p=0.02). The levels of IL-5 protein did not correlate significantly with the symptoms score or with changes in the levels of IL-5 protein with IL-5 mRNA. These data show that changes in IL-5 mRNA in patients with allergic rhinitis undergoing an allergen challenge correlate with total symptom scores better than changes in IL-5 protein eluted from filter paper. Furthermore, these changes can be measured quantitatively in very small amounts of tissue."

Diagnosis of PE was based on clinical evaluation, radionuclide lung imaging, lower limb examination, and, when required, pulmonary angiography. D-Dimer performances, for both Liatest D-Dimer and standard D-Dimer ELISA (Asserachrom DDi), assays, were assessed at the end of the study. Among the 386 patients tested, 146 (37.8%) were classified as PE-positive. Liatest D-Dimer assay had a 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 97 to 100%) and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% confidence interval, 94 to 100%). A normal result, below the cutoff of 500 ng/ml, occurred in 83 of the 386 (21%) patients. There was a strong agreement between Liatest D-Dimer and Asserachrom DDi analyses. These findings suggest that this rapid, quantitative, and automated D-Dimer assay provides a useful diagnostic tool for the clinician with regard to exclusion of PE."

CD010864,0,12673923,0,[Diagnostic strategies of thrombo-embolic venous disease].,"The advent of non invasive tests (D-dimer and lower limb venous compression ultrasonography) and minimally invasive tests (helical CT scan) and the rehabilitation of clinical assessment have allowed the development of safe, rational and cost-effective diagnostic strategies for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Several algorithms have been validated in studies in which patients classified as not having venous thromboembolism are left untreated and followed up during 3 months. The safety of such strategies is established by comparing the 3-month thromboembolic risk in such patients with that of patients left untreated based on a normal venogram, pulmonary angiogram or lung scintigram. Venography or pulmonary angiography remains necessary in selected cases such as patients with a high clinical probability of venous thromboembolism and an inconclusive non invasive workup, representing only approximately 5 to 10% of all patients. Finally, suspected massive pulmonary embolism is a distinct clinical situation in which echocardiography plays a major role."
CD010864,0,22325599,0,Approaches to the study of Atg8-mediated membrane dynamics in vitro.,"Macro-autophagy is the intracellular stress-response pathway by which the cell packages portions of the cytosol for delivery into the lysosome. This ""packaging"" is carried out by the de novo formation of a new organelle called the autophagosome that grows and encapsulates cytosolic material for eventual lysosomal degradation. How autophagosomes form, including especially how the membrane expands and eventually closes upon itself is an area of intense study. One factor implicated in both membrane expansion and membrane fusion is the ubiquitin-like protein, Atg8. During autophagy, Atg8 becomes covalently bound to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the pre-autophagosomal membrane and remains bound through the maturation process of the autophagosome. In this chapter, we discuss two approaches to the in vitro reconstitution of this lipidation reaction. We then describe methods to study Atg8-PE mediated membrane tethering and fusion, two functions implicated in Atg8's role in autophagosome maturation."

CD010864,0,1669849,0,The 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome: antiphospholipid antibody pattern and clinical features of a series of 23 patients.,"Twenty-three patients with the 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome were studied over 2-6 years. Twenty-two (96%) had antiphospholipid antibodies detected by ELISA (87% had antibodies to thromboplastin and 70% to cardiolipin), and 18 out of the 21 tested patients (86%) had lupus anticoagulant activity by coagulative assays. Mean age of the cohort was 29.9 years and the sex ratio (female:male) 4.75:1. Eleven patients presented 18 venous and/or arterial thrombosis and 13 had 25 foetal losses (84% occurred during the second and third trimester). Other clinical features were migraine, livedo reticularis, and epilepsy. Three patients had relatives with systemic lupus erythematosus. Thrombocytopaenia was seen in 33%, antinuclear antibodies in low or moderate titre in 30%, and haemolytic anaemia in 13%. During the follow-up, two patients presented recurrent thrombosis despite anticoagulant therapy, one of them dying because of recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism. Four patients achieved successful term pregnancies after treatment with aspirin and a further patient after treatment with aspirin and low dose prednisolone. No patient developed systemic lupus erythematosus or any other definable connective tissue disease. The 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome may exist as a distinct clinical entity and all younger patients presenting with thrombotic events, foetal losses and/or thrombocytopaenia, without any evidence of a well defined disease, should be tested for antiphospholipid antibodies in order to rule out this syndrome."
CD010864,0,23299609,0,Submassive pulmonary embolism.,"The US Surgeon General estimates that 100,000 to 180,000 deaths occur annually from acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in the United States. The case of Ms A, a 60-year-old woman with acute PE and right ventricular dysfunction (submassive PE), illustrates the clinical challenge of identifying this high-risk patient population and determining when more aggressive immediate therapy should be pursued in addition to standard anticoagulation. The clinical examination, electrocardiogram, cardiac biomarkers, chest computed tomography, and echocardiography can be used to risk stratify patients with acute PE. Current options for more aggressive intervention in the treatment of patients with acute PE who are at increased risk of an adverse clinical course include systemic fibrinolysis, pharmacomechanical catheter-directed therapy, surgical pulmonary embolectomy, and inferior vena cava filter insertion. Determination of the optimal duration of anticoagulation and lifestyle modification to reduce overall cardiovascular risk are critical components of the long-term therapy of patients with acute PE."

CD010864,0,16680753,0,Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).,"Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) are associated with anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), a thrombotic disorder, but they are also frequently detected in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), a bleeding disorder. To investigate possible differences of APLA between these two disorders, we assayed IgG and IgM APLA by ELISA in 21 patients with ITP and 33 with APS. The APLA reacting against two protein target antigens, beta(2)-glycoprotein 1 (beta2GP1) and FVII/VIIa, and four phospholipids [cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)] as well as lupus anticoagulant (LA) were analyzed. We made the following observations: (i) IgG and IgM antibodies to beta2GP1 and IgM antibodies to FVII/VIIa were more common in APS than ITP, P < 0.05, while IgG antibodies against the phospholipids (aCL, aPC, aPS, aPE) were more common in ITP than APS, P < 0.05; (ii) multiple APLA > or =3 antigens) were more frequent in APS than ITP, P < 0.05; (iii) LA was frequently associated with APS but was absent in ITP; (iv) APLA is quite common in ITP: two-thirds were positive for at least one APLA. In summary, APLA are prevalent in ITP but their profile differs from APS. In APS, antibodies were predominantly against beta2GP1 and 80% had positive LA, while in ITP the APLA reacted most often with the phospholipids without LA. The difference in APLA may result in opposite clinical manifestations in two disorders."

This 29-year-old woman had been given a diagnosis of MCTD when she was 19 years old. She was admitted to our department two days after delivery of a child, because of dyspnea on exertion. Acute thromboembolism was suspected because of: (1) chest roentgenogram showing cardiomegaly and enlargement of the left main pulmonary artery, (2) a lung perfusion scan showing a segmental defect in the left S6 and S8 areas, (3) laboratory studies showing abnormally high WBC, LDH, FDP, and D-D dimer, and (4) arterial blood gas analyses showing mild hypoxemia and hypocapnia. Thrombolytic therapy with heparin and urokinase was begun, and was followed by a loop diurtic and anticoagulation with warfarin. One month after admission, cardiac enlargement and the A-aDO2 were found to have decreased. At that time, cardiac catheterization was done and revealed pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure: 45 mmHg) and low cardiac output with no detectable thrombosis in the left pulmonary artery. The patient was subsequently treated with a calcium antagonist and a prostacyclin derivative, and her condition was stable for 5 months. Then her exercise tolerance gradually decreased due to shortness of breath, and cardiomegaly gradually increased over the next 3 months. Eight months after delivery of the child, the patient died of right heart failure. In clinically stable patients with MCTD, delivery of a child may lead to pulmonary thromboembolism and pulmonary hypertension."

CD010864,0,22367958,0,Predicting the risk of venous thromboembolism recurrence.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a chronic disease with a 30% ten-year recurrence rate. The highest incidence of recurrence is in the first 6 months. Active cancer significantly increases the hazard of early recurrence, and the proportions of time on standard heparin with an APTT â¥ 0.2 anti-X(a) U/mL, and on warfarin with an INR â¥ 2.0, significantly reduce the hazard. The acute treatment duration does not affect recurrence risk after treatment is stopped. Independent predictors of late recurrence include increasing patient age and body mass index, leg paresis, active cancer and other persistent VTE risk factors, idiopathic VTE, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, antithrombin, protein C or protein S deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia and a persistently increased plasma fibrin D-dimer. A recommendation for secondary prophylaxis should be individualized based on the risk for recurrent VTE (especially fatal pulmonary embolism) and bleeding. The appropriateness of secondary prophylaxis should be continuously reevaluated, and the prophylaxis stopped if the benefit no longer exceeds the risk."

It is now clear that determination of clinical probability prior to diagnostic testing will improve patient management. D-dimer testing can be employed to decrease the need for imaging tests. Patients at low risk with a negative qualitative D-dimer can avoid imaging tests. Imaging test interpretation benefits from consideration of pretest probability also as this helps clinicians determine when a test may be falsely negative or falsely positive. Diagnostic strategies should include pretest clinical probability, D-dimer assays, and noninvasive imaging tests."
CD010864,0,16302156,0,Screening for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in outpatients with suspected DVT or PE by the sequential use of clinical score: a sensitive quantitative D-dimer test and noninvasive diagnostic tools.,"The requirement for a safe diagnostic strategy should be based on an overall posttest incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) of less than 1% during 3-month follow-up. The negative predictive value (NPV) during 3 months of follow-up is 98.1 to 99% after a normal venogram, 97 to 98% after a normal compression ultrasonography (CUS), and > 99% after serial CUS testing. Serial CUS testing is safe but 100 CUS must be repeated to find one or two CUS positive for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is not cost-effective and indicates the need to improve the diagnostic workup of DVT by the use of clinical score assessment and D-dimer testing. The NPV varies from 97.6 to 99.4% for low clinical score followed by a negative SimpiRED test, indicating the need for a first CUS. The NPV is 98.4 to 99.3% for a normal rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) VIDAS D-dimer test result (< 500 ng/mL) irrespective of clinical score. The NPV is more than 99% for a negative CUS followed by either a negative SimpiRED test or an ELISA VIDAS test result of < 1000 ng/mL without the need to repeat a second CUS within 1 week. The sequential use of a sensitive, rapid ELISA D-dimer and clinical score assessment will safely reduce the need for CUS testing by 40 to 60%. Large prospective outcome studies demonstrate that with one negative examination with complete duplex color ultrasonography (CCUS) of the proximal and distal veins of the affected leg with suspected DVT, it is safe to withhold anticoagulant treatment, with a negative predictive value of 99.5%. This may indicates that CCUS is equal to serial CUS or the combined use of clinical score, D-dimer testing, and CUS. Pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for segmental pulmonary embolism (PE) but not for subsegmental PE. A normal perfusion lung scan and a normal rapid ELISA VIDAS D-dimer test safely excludes PE. Helical spiral computed tomography (CT) detects all clinically relevant PE and a large number of alternative diagnoses in symptomatic patients with suspected PE and can replace both the ventilation perfusion scan and pulmonary angiography to safely rule in PE and to rule out PE with an NPV of > 99%. The combination of clinical assessment, a rapid ELISA VIDAS D-dimer, followed by CUS will reduce the need for helical spiral CT by 40 to 50%."
CD010864,0,19245123,0,Current issues in the diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis.,The diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is of high importance given that a DVT can progress to a life threatening pulmonary embolism (PE) if undetected. At the same time the treatment of DVT involves anticoagulation which can lead to fatal complications and hence accurate evaluation methods are needed to diagnose or rule out DVT. Diagnosis of DVT has evolved recently with the introduction of clinical prediction rules combined with d-dimer and compression ultrasonography (CUS). Multidetector CT venography and MR venography have been used for the conformation of the diagnosis. Therapy of DVT has also evolved with the introduction of new anticoagulant agents. However much research needs to be done in regard to factors affecting recurrence and the duration of anticoagulation.

In routine clinical practice, the present authors evaluated the performance of a commercially available Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and pleural effusion mononuclear cells (PEMCs) in patients with suspect plTB. The T-SPOT.TB test (Oxford Immunotec Ltd, Abingdon, UK) was performed on PBMCs and PEMCs in 20 patients with a clinical and radiological suspect of plTB and in 21 control subjects with a diagnosis of PE of nontuberculous origin at four centres participating in the European Tuberculosis Network. In total, 18 (90%) out of 20 patients with plTB tested T-SPOT.TB-positive on PBMCs and 19 (95%) out of 20 on PEMCs. Among controls, T-SPOT.TB was positive in seven out of 21 (33%) patients when performed on PBMCs (these patients were assumed to be latently infected with MTB) and five (23%) out of 21 when performed on PEMCs. Sensitivity and specificity of T-SPOT.TB for the diagnosis of active plTB when performed on PEMCs were 95 and 76%, respectively. Enumerating Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific T-cells in pleural effusion mononuclear cells by ELISPOT is feasible in routine clinical practice and may be useful for a rapid and accurate diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis."

In a previous study of patients submitted to ventilation--perfusion (V-P) scintigraphy we suggested that measurement of D-dimer might be of value for ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism if the plasma level was less than 500 micrograms/l (ELISA). In the present paper, this cut-off was validated in a consecutive series of 21 patients who were submitted to pulmonary angiography. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 36%, respectively. When these data were pooled with the results obtained following V-P scintigraphy (total number of patients = 67), sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 100%, 70%, 59% and 100%, respectively. It is therefore worthwhile to further evaluate the value of the plasma measurement of D-dimers, especially in patients with inconclusive lung scintigraphy."

The aim of the study was to investigate the usefulness of serial fibrin monomer determinations to predict or rule out DVT after total knee arthroplasty in asymptomatic patients. One hundred and thirty consecutive patients underwent total knee replacement. Blood samples were obtained in 104 of them the day before, at days 1, 3, 6 after surgery and at the day of phlebography. Phlebography was performed in all these patients between days 8 and 12 after surgery. There were 44 DVT (44/104, 42%). As compared with the patients without DVT, FM mean levels were 2 and 1.5 times higher in the DVT group at day 3 (P < 0.001) and day 6 (P < 0.01), respectively. However, no useful cut-off values for DVT prediction or exclusion could be determined due to the scattering of the values. Therefore, despite differences between patients with or without DVT, serial FM determinations are of no value for predicting or ruling out DVT in individual patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty."

CD010864,0,10063995,0,Performances of the fibrin monomer test for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in symptomatic outpatients.,"Many studies have shown that D-dimer determinations can be used for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism in symptomatic outpatients, depending however on the method of D-dimer measurement. Another related assay, the Fibrin Monomer test which measures soluble fibrin levels in plasma by ELISA, is now available. We have evaluated the performances of this assay for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) in 426 consecutive outpatients presenting at the emergency ward of our institution. Diagnosis of PE was made by D-dimer measurement, compression ultrasonography, lung scintigraphy, venography and pulmonary angiography. With a cut-off of 3 microg/ml. the sensitivity and the negative predictive value were both 100% (95% CI: 97.1-100 and 96.3-100 respectively) and the specificity 33% (95 % CI: 25.7-38.1). With 4 microg/ml, the corresponding figures were 98.4 (95% CI: 94.4-99.8), 98.3 (95% CI: 94.1-99.8) and 39% (95% CI: 33.6-44.7) respectively. The prevalence of PE was 30%, the exclusion rates were 23 and 27% for either cut-off. When compared with a reference D-dimer assay (Asserachrom D-Di), a good correlation was observed. In conclusion, this is the first study suggesting the interest of this Fibrin Monomer test to rule out PE; these results, however, need to be confirmed by other studies."

Sixteen patients (ages 24 to 74 years) with diagnosis of PE, documented by ventilation perfusion scan or pulmonary angiogram, were the subjects of this study. Ten cc of urine was obtained from each patient and subjected to a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay thus determining the soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor I (R I) and TNF alpha levels in these samples. In this pilot study of PE cases, a statistically significant elevation in urinary levels of TNF alpha and soluble TNF R I was demonstrated in PE patients. The average urinary soluble TNF R I in normal subjects was 1,029 pg/mL and in PE patients the average TNF R I was 3,734.4 pg/mL. The clinical diagnosis of PE is a challenging problem for the physician. Late diagnosis and delayed management of this condition could be associated with massive PE. Although pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis of PE, it requires expensive equipment, trained radiologists, and the patient could be at risk of sensitivity to contrast agents."
CD010864,0,12476362,0,"Glutaraldehyde inhalation exposure of rats: effects on lung morphology, Clara-cell protein, and hyaluronic acid levels in BAL.","Glutaraldehyde (GA) is a biocide widely used in hospital and laboratory practice. GA is a volatile substance and, under certain circumstances, significant airborne concentrations may be generated at room temperature. Occupational exposure to GA by inhalation is suspected of causing delayed irritating effects. In recent years, GA has emerged as the main cause of occupational asthma among health-care workers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate effects of GA inhalatory exposure (0.025 ppm or 0.1 ppm, for 28 days) in rats exposed corresponding to the occupational shift cycle, at time point 24 h, 48 h, and 7 days postexposure (PE). Numerous vacuoles and dilated spaces in epithelial cells in bronchioles showing a destructive effect of GA on the cellular membrane were observed at 24 h PE in 0.1 ppm exposed rats. Lipid vacuoles observed after 48 h PE in higher GA exposure, in the Clara cells of the bronchial epithelium, and in endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries are probably attributable to disturbed lipid metabolism. Many foci of collagen fibers were observed already after 7 days postexposure. Monitoring of inflammatory response and repair was made possible by using two biomarkers: Clara-cell protein (CC16) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Our results show that the inflammatory repair response contributed to progenitor Clara cells and HA plays a role in the development of fibrotic changes in the lung of rats. Glutaraldehyde in rats causes fibrotic effects at the actual threshold limit value-time weighted average (TLV-TWA) level for GA as specified by current Polish and other national regulations."

This test relies on a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a fluorogenic substrate in a radial partition immunoassay system in a dedicated device. It does not require laboratory staff and the results are available within 18 min. Two hundred and ninety-one frozen samples from patients suspected of either deep venous thrombosis (n = 137) or pulmonary embolism (n = 154) were measured and the results compared with the VIDAS D-dimer New assay. There were 37 deep venous thrombosis (27%) and 49 pulmonary embolism (32%) samples. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the cut-off value could be set at either 300 or 400 ng/ml Fibrinogen Equivalent Units (FEU). The coefficient of variation determined with a lyophilized low-level control plasma (305 ng/ml FEU) was 6%. With a cut-off at 300 ng/ml FEU, the sensitivity, the specificity and the negative predictive value were 100% [95% confidence interval (CI), 95.8-100], 33.1% (95% CI, 26.8-40) and 100% (95% CI, 94.7-100), respectively. Raising the cut-off to 400 ng/ml FEU, the corresponding figures were 96.5% (95% CI, 90.1-99.3), 46.3% (95% CI, 39.4-53.2) and 96.9% (95% CI, 91.3-99.4), respectively. At 400 ng/ml, three results were false-negative, one with both devices and two with the Stratus D-dimer only.

We have identified risk factors for serious adverse events (SAE) within the first 10 days of acute PE. We have retrospectively analysed data of 440 consecutive patients with acute PE. Collected data included age, gender, medical history, blood pressure, pulse rate and D-dimer concentration. The variables associated with SAE in the first 10 days in univariate analysis (p<0.15) have been included in a multivariate logistic regression model (backward conditional, p out >0.10). In 440 patients with acute PE, 20 SAEs occurred in a 10-day follow-up period. Pulse rate > or = 100 beats per minute (bpm) (OR, 6.85; 95%CI 1.43-32.81) and D-dimer concentration > or = 3,000 microg/ml (OR, 5.51; 95%CI 0.68-44.64) were significantly related to the SAEs. All SAEs were predicted by a pulse rate > or = 100 bpm and/or a D-dimer concentration > or = 3,000 microg/ml. Older age, gender, history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer or a systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg had no significant influence on short term SAEs. Pulse rate and D-dimer concentration can be used to identify patients with acute PE, who are at risk for adverse clinical outcome during the first 10 days of hospitalisation. Outpatient treatment of PE-patients with a pulse rate > or = 100 bpm and/or a D-dimer concentration > or = 3,000 microg/ml has to be discouraged."

CD010864,0,23294863,0,Diagnostic management of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.,"Acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) represent two expressions of a similar clinical pathological process, often referred to as venous thromboembolism (VTE). It has long been recognized that, as clinical signs and symptoms of PE and DVT are not specific for the diagnosis, objective diagnosis in both patients presenting with leg symptoms and those with chest symptoms is mandatory. Since the last review on this subject in this journal in 2009, several large trials have been performed that shed new light on all aspects of the diagnostic management of suspected VTE, especially in the field of simplified clinical decision rules, age-dependent D-dimer cut-offs and magnetic resonance imaging. A literature search covering the period 2007-2012 was performed using the Medline/PubMed database to identify all relevant papers regarding the diagnostic management of acute PE and DVT. Established concepts and the latest evidence on this subject will be the main focus of this review."

The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with LOS and to investigate whether LOS is suitable to assess effectiveness of thrombolysis in patients with intermediate-risk PE.
CD010864,0,10429538,0,[Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism].,"A good knowledge of clinical presentation and of risk factors for pulmonary embolism is mandatory to improve adequate clinical suspicion. Some recent improvements in diagnostic strategy have to be emphasized. A low D-dimer level has a good negative predictive value to rule out pulmonary embolism. Ventilation-perfusion lung scan is the most often used imaging technique. In case of non diagnostic scan, serial non invasive search for deep vein thrombosis in the limbs is recommended by some experts at least in patients with good cardio-respiratory reserve, pulmonary angiography being recommended otherwise. Spiral CT allows direct demonstration of clots, being hardly less sensitive than pulmonary angiography except for subsegmental emboli. Future perspectives include the use of spiral CT as first choice procedure, as well as magnetic resonance imaging."

CD010864,0,21258266,0,Rapid assessment of cerebral autoregulation by near-infrared spectroscopy and a single dose of phenylephrine.,"Rapid bedside determination of cerebral blood pressure autoregulation (AR) may improve clinical utility. We tested the hypothesis that cerebral Hb oxygenation (HbDiff) and cerebral Hb volume (HbTotal) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) would correlate with cerebral blood flow (CBF) after single dose phenylephrine (PE). Critically ill patients requiring artificial ventilation and arterial lines were eligible. During rapid blood pressure rise induced by i.v. PE bolus, ÎHbDiff and ÎHbTotal were calculated by subtracting values at baseline (normotension) from values at peak blood pressure elevation (hypertension). With the aid of NIRS and bolus injection of indocyanine green, relative measures of CBF, called blood flow index (BFI), were determined during normotension and during hypertension. BFI during hypertension was expressed as percentage from BFI during normotension (BFI%). Autoregulation indices (ARIs) were calculated by dividing BFI%, ÎHbDiff, and ÎHbTotal by the concomitant change in blood pressure. In 24 patients (11 newborns and 13 children), significant correlations between BFI% and ÎHbDiff (or ÎHbTotal) were found. In addition, the associations between Hb-based ARI and BFI%-based ARI were significant with correlation coefficients of 0.73 (or 0.72). Rapid determination of dynamic AR with the aid of cerebral Hb signals and PE bolus seems to be reliable."
CD010864,0,10898275,0,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a critical risk/benefit analysis of patients in intensive care treated with R-hirudin.,"Patients in intensive care may be at high risk of in vivo platelet activation because comorbid conditions, such as infections, septicemia, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cancer represent procoagulant states. Hyperreactivity of platelets with or without a decline of cell count may result in thromboembolic complications potentially associated with the phenomenon of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. We analyzed the data of 10 patients highly suspected of having heparin-induced thrombocytopenia during their intensive care treatment of 29 plus or minus 22 days. In seven patients, thrombocytopenia coincided with thromboembolic complications. Six patients had additionally undergone fibrinolytic therapy before starting activated partial thromboplastin time-adapted alternative anticoagulation with r-hirudin. In three patients, the platelet count decreased without a clinical manifestation, of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. R-Hirudin treatment monitored by activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time (PT) was effective and safe. The target value for activated partial thromboplastin time was a twofold prolongation. In four of five patients with deep venous thrombosis, a partial recanalization of the lower extremity could be achieved. Three patients with pulmonary embolism associated with deep venous thrombosis in two cases and in one additional case with an acute myocardial infarction did clinically profit from fibrinolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and r-hirudin treatment. Two lethal events probably caused by the underlying multimorbidity could not be prevented. No recurrence of thrombosis occurred, and there were no severe bleeding complications attributed to r-hirudin treatment. Platelet counts were significantly reduced on day 9.4 plus or minus 6.4 of heparin administration in all cases (>50% decrease related to the initial values) from 224,000 plus or minus 126,000/microL to 96,000 plus or minus 61,000/microL, and increased during rhirudin treatment to mean values of 224,000 plus or minus 126,000/microL. The heparin-induced platelet activation assay (HIPAA) assay was positive in 8/10 cases, whereas the PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed a positive result in four of eight analyzed cases. In four cases, the assays were concordantly positive. The PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was not performed in two cases."

CD010864,0,23414824,0,Pulmonary embolism: role of ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy.,"The evaluation for pulmonary embolism in the emergency setting has many challenges. Patients often present with symptoms that are nonspecific. Emergency Department physicians utilize their own subjective judgment or objective clinical algorithms, such as the Wells Score to assess the likelihood of the patient having PE. Other techniques, such as D-dimer assays and Doppler ultrasound leg studies for deep venous thrombosis are very useful, as well. Ventilation-perfusion lung scans and computed tomography pulmonary angiography are both available in most institutions. However, factors such as sensitivity or specificity, overnight availability, radiation exposure, and comfort with interpretation criteria play a role in deciding which procedure should be used. Relative merits of both the procedures will be discussed."

At the onset of AMI, plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), PA inhibitor-I (PAI-I), fibrin-D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), and plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex (PPIC) were significantly increased. Both the plasma total TFPI and free-TFPI levels in the AMI patients were significantly higher than those in the healthy volunteers, PE patients, and DVT patients. There was no significant difference in total TFPI or free-TFPI among patients with PE, those with DVT, and healthy volunteers. One hour after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in the AMI group, the total TFPI level was further increased, and it was significantly reduced 24 hr after PTCA, to a level similar to that in healthy volunteers. Free-TFPI showed a pattern similar to that of total TFPI. The ratio of free-TFPI/total TFPI was highest 1 hr after PTCA. Increased TFPI in AMI patients might be released from ischemic tissues."
CD010864,0,12074276,0,Serum uric acid level increases in proportion to the severity of pulmonary thromboembolism.,"Serum uric acid (UA) has been proposed as a marker for impaired oxidative metabolism and the present study investigated whether serum UA level increases in proportion to the severity of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in 193 patients. Serum UA was repeatedly measured after treatment of PTE in 76 patients. Right heart catheterization was performed in a subgroup of patients (n=104). Serum UA on admission was significantly elevated in patients with acute PTE (6.2+/-2.3 mg/dl) and those with chronic PTE (7.0+/-2.1 mg/dl) compared with age-matched controls (4.5+/-0.9 mg/ml). In particular, serum UA was markedly higher in the 27 patients who died during hospitalization than in the remaining survivors (8.3+/-2.2 vs 6.5+/-2.2 mg/dl, p<0.001). In acute PTE, serum UA negatively correlated with cardiac output, but not significantly with mean pulmonary arterial pressure. In chronic PTE, serum UA negatively correlated with cardiac output and positively correlated with mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Serum UA significantly decreased from 6.7+/-2.0 to 5.8+/-1.9 mg/dl with treatment, associated with an increase in cardiac output and in PaO2. Serum UA increases in proportion to the severity of PTE, and thereby may serve as a potential indicator of the efficacy of treatment of PTE."

Serology, bacteriology, pathogenesis, and transmission to cattle.","Two groups of six, non-brucellosis vaccinated, brucellosis seronegative pregnant American bison (Bison bison) were individually challenged with 1 x 10(7) colony forming units (CFU) of Brucella abortus strain 2308. Three days after challenge, each bison group was placed in a common paddock with six non-vaccinated, brucellosis susceptible, pregnant domestic heifers. In a parallel study, two groups of six susceptible, pregnant cattle were simultaneously challenged with the identical dose as the bison and each group was placed with six susceptible cattle in order to compare bison to cattle transmission to that observed in cattle to cattle transmission. Blood samples were collected from bison and cattle weekly for at least 1 mo prior to exposure to B. abortus and for 180 days post-exposure (PE). Sera from the bison and cattle were evaluated by the Card, rivanol precipitation, standard plate agglutination, standard tube agglutination, cold complement fixation tube, warm complement fixation tube, buffered acidified plate antigen, rapid screening, bovine conjugated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, bison or bovine conjugated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and the hemolysis-in-gel techniques for the presence of antibodies to Brucella spp. At the termination of pregnancy by abortion or birth of a live-calf, quarter milk samples, vaginal swabs, and placenta were collected from the dam. Rectal swabs were collected from live calves, and mediastinal lymph nodes, abomasal contents and lung were taken at necropsy from aborted fetuses for culture of Brucella spp. These tissues and swabs were cultured on restrictive media for the isolation and identification of Brucella spp. Pathogenesis of brucellosis in bison was studied in an additional group of six pregnant bison which were challenged with 1 x 10(7) CFU of B. abortus strain 2308. One animal was euthanatized each week PE. Tissues were collected at necropsy and later examined bacteriologically and histologically. Lesions of brucellosis in bison did not significantly differ grossly or histologically from those in cattle. There were six abortions and two nonviable calves in the bison group, as compared to nine abortions in the 12 similarly inoculated cattle. As determined by bacterial isolations, transmission of B. abortus from bison to cattle (five of 12 susceptible cattle became infected) did not differ statistically from cattle to cattle transmission (six of 12 susceptible cattle became infected) under identical conditions. No single serologic test was constantly reliable to diagnosing B. abortus infected bison for 8 wk PE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD010864,0,22940402,0,Deep vein thrombosis: current status and nanotechnology advances.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) affects up to 2 million people in the United States, and worldwide incidence is 70 to 113 cases per 100,000 per year. Mortality from DVT is often due to subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE). Precise diagnosis and treatment is thereby essential for the management of DVT. DVT is diagnosed by a thorough history and physical examination followed by laboratory and diagnostic tests. The choice of laboratory and diagnostic test is dependent on clinical pretest probability. Available laboratory and diagnostic techniques mainly involve D-dimer test, ultrasound, venography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The latter two diagnostic tools require high doses of contrast agents including either radioactive or toxic materials. The available treatment options include lifestyle modifications, mechanical compression, anticoagulant therapy, inferior vena cava filter, and thrombolysis/thrombolectomy. All of these medical and surgical treatments have serious side effects including improper clot clearance and increased risk of hemorrhage occurrence. Therefore, research in this field has recently focused on the development of non-invasive and accurate diagnostics, such as ultrasound enhanced techniques and molecular imaging methods, to assess thrombus location and its treatment course. The frontier of nanomedicine also shows high prospects in tackling DVT with efficient targeted drug delivery. This review describes the pathology of DVT along with successive medical problems such as PE and features a detailed listing of various diagnostic and therapeutic modalities that have been in use and are under development."
CD010864,0,21847593,0,Predictive value of D-dimer test for recurrent venous thromboembolism at hospital discharge in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.,"D-dimer can be used to exclude acute pulmonary embolism (PE) for its high negative predictive value (NPV). Also, it is a predictor of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) after anticoagulation withdrawal. The aim of the present study was to assess the predictive value of D-dimer for recurrent VTE when tested at hospital discharge. Plasma D-dimer levels were repeatedly measured at hospital discharge in 204 consecutive patients with the first episode of acute pulmonary embolism. Patients were categorized to two groups by D-dimer levels at hospital discharge and followed up at 3, 6, and 12Â months and yearly thereafter. The primary end point was symptomatic, recurrent fatal or nonfatal VTE. D-dimer levels were persistently abnormal in 66 patients (32%). After 31Â±19Â months follow-up, patients with persistently abnormal D-dimer level levels showed a higher rate of of recurrent VTE (14 patients, 21%) compared to those with D-dimer regression (8 patients, 6%) (PÂ =Â 0.001). At the multivariate analysis, after adjustment for other relevant factors, persistently abnormal D-dimer level levels were an independent predictor of recurrent VTE in all subjects investigated, (hazard ratio, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.61-10.39; PÂ =Â 0.003), especially in those with unprovoked PE (hazard ratio, 4.61; 95% CI, 1.85-11.49; PÂ =Â 0.001). The negative predictive value of D-dimer was 94.2 and 92.9% in all subjects or those with unprovoked PE, respectively. Persistently abnormal D-dimer level levels at hospital discharge have a high negative predictive value for recurrence in patients with acute pulmonary embolism, especially in subjects with an unprovoked previous event."

CD010864,0,7822246,0,A novel peptide probe for studying the transbilayer movement of phosphatidylethanolamine.,"Ro09-0198 is a cyclic peptide isolated from Streptoverticillium griseoverticillatum which recognizes strictly the structure of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and forms an equimolar complex with the phospholipid on biological membranes. To use the peptide as a probe for analyzing the transbilayer movement of PE, we labeled the amino-terminal amino acid of the peptide with biotin without changing either the reactivity or specificity of the peptide. The amount of the peptide bound to the membrane was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after extraction of the peptide from the membrane. The peptide showed a strict temperature-dependent binding to human erythrocytes and the binding increased with increasing temperature. Since the peptide bound to PE in a temperature-independent manner and the binding to membrane PE is not affected by membrane proteins, the present temperature-dependent binding of the peptide to the cell membranes was likely to reflect temperature-dependent translocation of PE. The binding of the peptide to erythrocytes differed greatly among animal species. The peptide also showed temperature-dependent binding to a human histocytic lymphoma cell line, U937, suggesting that the peptide will provide a novel and convenient probe for analyzing the transbilayer movement of PE in eukaryotic cells."
CD010864,0,17868025,0,Antitumour activity of cationic-liposome-conjugated adenovirus containing the CCL19 [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19] gene.,"CCL19 [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19; also known as MIP-3beta (macrophage inflammatory protein-3beta) or ELC (Epstein-Barr-virus-induced molecule 1 ligand chemokine)], one of the immunostimulatory cytokines, chemoattracts both DCs (dendritic cells) and T-lymphocytes. Adenoviral vector is one of the most used gene delivery vectors for cancer therapy because of its high gene-transfection efficiency. However, its wider application is limited, owing to immune responses that reduce transgene expression and decrease the efficacy of repeated administration. We constructed the recombinant replication deficient adenoviral vectors containing the CCL19 gene (Ad-CCL19) and combined them with PEG-PE [poly(ethylene glycol)-phosphatidylethanolamine]-modified cationic liposomes (Ad-CCL19/PEG-PE) for immunotherapy against murine fibrosarcoma. Although there were hardly any therapeutic differences between Ad-CCL19- and Ad-CCL19/PEG-PE-treated mice that were observed at the second administration, the final results demonstrated that Ad-CCL19/PEG-PE-treated mice survived much longer. The antitumour efficacy may be related to the high level of CCL19 after the final administration and lasting expression of IFN-gamma (interferon-gamma) and IL-12 (interleukin-12) in the Ad-CCL19/PEG-PE-treated group, which were measured by reverse-transcription PCR and ELISA. The results demonstrated that PEG-PE-cationic-liposome-conjugated adenovirus could prolong the expression of the therapeutic gene in vivo and may enhance the antitumour efficacy."

CD010864,0,23767418,0,Common lung conditions: acute dyspnea.,"Dyspnea is a subjective experience of breathing discomfort; patients experience qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity. Acute dyspnea might be secondary to an acute problem, or it might be an exacerbation of an existing disease (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure). It also accompanies a variety of illnesses at the end of life. New information has changed differentiation between respiratory and cardiovascular etiologies of acute dyspnea, as well as rapid diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Management of acute dyspnea from hypercapnic failure also has changed. Patients presenting with dyspnea most commonly have underlying cardiovascular and/or respiratory etiologies, and differentiating between the two can be challenging. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are elevated when ventricular wall tension increases (eg, during a heart failure exacerbation). BNP and NT-proBNP are most useful for identifying patients with dyspnea who do not have heart failure. A BNP level less than 50 pg/mL has a negative predictive value of 96%, effectively ruling out heart failure; a serum BNP level less than 100 pg/mL has a negative likelihood ratio of 0.11. Patients with pulmonary embolism often present with dyspnea, and this condition needs to be diagnosed and managed expeditiously. When pulmonary embolism is suspected, use a clinical decision rule (eg, the Wells rule, the Geneva rule) to establish the probability of this condition. For patients with a low probability, obtain a D-dimer test; if the D-dimer result is negative, monitor the patient. A positive D-dimer result requires further investigation. For patients with intermediate or high probability, obtain computed tomography pulmonary angiography for a definitive diagnosis. Patients who have dyspnea from a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation can experience hypercapnic failure. As an adjunct to usual medical treatment, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation decreases the need for mechanical ventilation and is particularly useful in patients who have chosen not to be resuscitated with intubation."

CD010864,0,8059232,0,Antiphospholipid and thrombosis syndromes.,"ACAs and the lupus anticoagulant are strongly associated with thrombosis and appear to be the most common of the acquired blood protein defects causing thrombosis. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms whereby antiphospholipid antibodies alter hemostasis to induce a hypercoagulable state remain unclear, several theories, as previously discussed, have been advanced. The most common thrombotic events associated with ACAs are DVT and PE (type I syndrome), coronary or peripheral artery thrombosis (type II syndrome), cerebrovascular or retinal vessel thrombosis (type III syndrome), and occasionally patients present with mixtures (type IV syndrome). The relative frequency of ACAs in association with arterial and venous thrombosis strongly suggests that these should be looked for in any patient with unexplained thrombosis; all three idiotypes (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be assessed. Also, the type of syndrome (I through IV) should be defined, if possible, because this may dictate both type and duration of both immediate and long-term anticoagulant therapy. Unlike those with ACAs, patients with primary lupus anticoagulant thrombosis syndrome usually have venous thrombosis. Since the aPTT is unreliable in patients with lupus anticoagulant and is not usually prolonged in patients with ACAs, definitive tests (ELISA for ACA and the dRVVT for lupus anticoagulant) should be immediately ordered when suspecting antiphospholipid syndrome or in patients with otherwise unexplained thrombotic or thromboembolic events."

It was the aim of our study to investigate the association of IL-6 and its promoter polymorphism (-174) G > C with the risk of spontaneousVTE. IL-6 was measured in 128 patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT,70 w/58 m),105 with pulmonary embolism (PE, 58 w/47 m) and 122 healthy controls (60 w/62 m) with a highly sensitive ELISA (Quantikine HS Human IL-6 Immunoassay, RnDSystems). The promoter polymorphism was determined by genotyping, allele specific PCR was followed by high resolution gel-electrophoresis. Median concentrations [interquartile ranges] were 2.37 [1.51-3.89] (pg/ml) in patients with DVT, 2.83 [1.83-4.87] in those with PE and 2.51 [1.71-4.78] in controls (p = 0.6, p = 0.4). Hetero- or homozygous carriers of the C allele (71% in DVT, 67% in PE and 59% among controls) did not have higher IL-6 levels than homozygous carriers of the G allele (median 2.60 vs. 2.59 pg/ml, p = 0.7). In conclusion, we found no association of IL-6 and its promoter polymorphism (-174) G > C with the risk of spontaneous VTE."
CD010864,0,8165626,0,Plasma measurement of D-dimer as diagnostic aid in suspected venous thromboembolism: an overview.,"This paper reviews the published experience with plasma measurement of D-dimer (DD), a specific degradation product of crosslinked fibrin, in the diagnostic approach of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Pooling 11 studies (with weighting of the figures according to sample size) with a total of 1337 patients clinically suspected of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (prevalence of DVT 35%) disclosed an average weighted sensitivity of 96.8% (95% CI: 95.2-98.4) and specificity of 35.2% (95% CI: 32.0-38.4) for the presence of DVT when the ELISA technique was used. In 908 patients suspected of pulmonary embolism (PE) from 9 trials (prevalence of PE 38%), the ELISA technique was associated with a weighted sensitivity of 96.8% (95% CI: 95.0-98.6) and specificity of 45.1% (95% CI: 40.8-49.4) for the disease. Figures obtained with latex assays were definitely lower, precluding their use in the diagnostic approach of VTE. These results show that a low concentration of plasma DD measured by the ELISA technique (usually less than 500 micrograms/l) might be used to rule out VTE in clinically suspected patients. Increased plasma concentrations are of no utility because of the low specificity of this test result. The clinical usefulness of the DD ELISA test should now be assessed in management trials under routine conditions, in the frame of clinical decision-making diagnostic processes. Lastly, the promising data obtained in a small number of asymptomatic, postoperative patients at risk of VTE deserve confirmation before the test can be recommended for initial screening in thrombo-prophylactic trials."

CD010864,0,15668186,0,Pilot study on the use of tourniquet: a risk factor for pulmonary thromboembolism after total knee arthroplasty?,"The risk of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with tourniquet is still controversial. In this study, we determined whether plasma D-dimer could be used as a marker of PTE, and whether intraoperative use of tourniquet is a risk factor for symptomatic PTE after TKA. We divided 86 patients (12 males and 74 females) who underwent primary TKA into four groups based on (i) operation method (unilateral/bilateral) and (ii) use of pneumatic tourniquet during surgery (with/without). Plasma D-dimer values were measured preoperatively and on Day 1 postoperatively. ""D1-value"" was defined as the difference between postoperative and preoperative plasma D-dimer levels. We determined the cutoff level of ""D1-value"" for symptomatic PTE, monitored by O(2) saturation (SAT) and lung scintigraphy. ""D1-values"" for patients with PTE symptoms were higher than those without symptoms (p<0.001). Furthermore, ""D1-values"" for TKA without tourniquet procedures were significantly lower than those with tourniquet both in unilateral (p=0.003) and bilateral groups (p=0.004). At a cutoff level of >or=8.6 mug/mL, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 100%, 82.5%, 30.0% and 100% for symptomatic PTE, respectively. The results of our pilot study showed that elevated plasma ""D1 value"" is a sensitive marker for detection of PTE. Further studies will be needed, in order to evaluate the risk of tourniquet, and to reduce PTE after TKA."

PBMC were treated to determine cell proliferation and cytokine production with different sterols: ergosterol (E), a mixture of eleven Algae sterols extracted and purified from D. tertiolecta (Algae Extract, AE), a mixture of ergosterol and 7-dehydroporiferasterol extracted and purified from D. tertiolecta (Purified Extract, PE). Cytokine production (TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î², and IL-10) was evaluated after cell treatment with Concanavalin A (Con A) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The mixture of ergosterol and 7-dehydroporiferasterol extracted and purified from D. tertiolecta showed a suppressive effect on cell proliferation, and a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines production. Furthermore, a stimulatory effect on the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 was found. The immunosuppressive effect exerted by the mixture of ergosterol and 7-dehydroporiferasterol from D. tertiolecta was dose-dependent both in suppressing cell proliferation and in stimulating IL-10 production. Present results showed that the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities were more apparent in the purified extract characterized by the mixture of ergosterol and 7-dehydroporiferasterol, and might depend on the existence of a synergic effect of the structures of the two phytosterols. Furthermore, findings from our study suggest that the purified extract characterized by the mixture of ergosterol and 7-dehydroporiferasterol from D. tertiolecta could be used to reduce immune reactions resulting from inflammatory diseases in sheep production systems, and could have innovative implications on the modulation of sheep immune system when used as feed supplements."
CD010864,0,23225668,0,Local effect of IL-4 delivery on polyethylene particle induced osteolysis in the murine calvarium.,"Wear particles generated with use of total joint replacements incite a chronic macrophage-mediated inflammatory reaction, which leads to implant failure. Macrophage activation may be polarized into two states, with an M1 proinflammatory state dominating an alternatively activated M2 anti-inflammatory state. We hypothesized that IL-4, an activator of M2 macrophages, could modulate polyethylene (PE) particle-induced osteolysis in an experimental murine model. Four animal groups included (a) calvarial saline injection with harvest at 14 days (b) single calvarial injection of PE particles subcutaneously (SC) without IL-4 (c) PE particles placed as in (b), then IL-4 given SC for 14 consecutive days and (d) PE particles as in (b) then IL-4 beginning 7 days after particle injection for 7 days. The calvarial bone volume to total tissue volume was measured using microCT and histomorphometry. Calvaria were cultured for 24 h to assess release of RANKL, OPG, TNF-Î±, and IL-1ra and isolation and identification of M1 and M2 specific proteins. MicroCT and histomorphometric analysis showed that bone loss was significantly decreased following IL-4 administration to PE treated calvaria for both 7 and 14 days. Western blot analysis showed an increased M1/M2 ratio in the PE treated calvaria, which decreased with addition of IL-4. Cytokine analysis showed that the RANKL/OPG ratio and TNF-Î±/IL-1ra ratio decreased in PE-treated calvaria following IL-4 addition for 14 days. IL-4 delivery mitigated PE particle-induced osteolysis through macrophage polarization. Modulation of macrophage polarization is a potential treatment strategy for wear particle induced periprosthetic osteolysis."

New, noninvasive tools such as D-dimer measurement and lower limb venous compression ultrasonography have been introduced as diagnostic strategies. Clinical evaluation of the likelihood of PE has been rehabilitated and has proven to be accurate and useful. The interpretation of lung scan results has become more standardized and clear to clinicians. Finally, two diagnostic strategies have been validated in large scale outcome studies. Both rely on a sequential combination of the aforementioned instruments and have safely treated more than 90% of patients without use of pulmonary angiography. The 3-month venous thromboembolic risk in patients in whom PE was ruled out and, hence, who did not undergo anticoagulation was less than 1% in both studies. In the absence of a formal comparison of their respective cost-effectiveness, choosing between these strategies rests on local preferences or logistics. Finally, spiral computed tomography (CT) seems promising and might modify the diagnostic work-up of PE in the near future. However, it is insufficiently validated, and its place in a rational diagnostic algorithm is not defined."

Stable liposomes with entrapped glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) were prepared with unsaturated PE stabilized with 5 mol percent of ganglioside GM1. Addition of beta-galactosidase caused rapid (3-5 min) lysis of liposomes, revealing the latent G6PDH activity, owing to the enzymatic degalactosylation of GM1. We have used Microgenic's CEDIA assay for digoxin as an example. The magnitude of signal was 25 mA/min per microgram of digoxin per liter for the unamplified assay and 1000 mA/min per microgram of digoxin per liter for the liposome-enhanced assay--i.e., a 40-fold amplification. This simple, rapid, and homogeneous signal-amplification mechanism is likely to be useful in many enzyme-dependent assays, such as ELISA, CEDIA, gene-probe assays, and immunoliposome assays."

The Coagulation Project Investigators of the Bolus Alteplase Pulmonary Embolism Group.,"The aim of this study was to compare the effects on fibrinogenolysis and thrombin generation of two recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) regimens in patients with pulmonary embolism entering a randomised, controlled study with a 1:2 allocation ratio to rt-PA, 100 mg over 2 h (Group A) or rt-PA, 0.6 mg/kg, maximum dose 50 mg, over 15 min (Group B). In both groups the heparin infusion was stopped 2-4 h before starting thrombolytic treatment and resumed accordingly to the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or thrombin clotting time (TcT). Seventeen patients in Group A and 30 patients in Group B were evaluated before starting thrombolytic treatment and 2, 6 and 24 h after its end for the following parameters: aPTT, TcT, fibrinogen, fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), plasmin-alpha 2 antiplasmin (PAP) and thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) complexes. The two groups had similar coagulation parameters at baseline. Two h after starting rt-PA, the aPTT was more prolonged in Group A than in Group B patients (P = 0.01). Patients in Group B showed less reduction in plasma fibrinogen levels at all study times after rt-PA treatment (P = 0.008). The increase in plasma FDP (P = 0.037) and PAP (P = 0.001) levels was lower at 2 and 6 h samples in Group B compared with Group A. TcT was prolonged (P = 0.003) and TAT increased (P = 0.001) during treatment without differences between the two groups. AUC0-24 of fibrinogen, FDP and PAP levels confirmed the statistically significant differences (P = 0.04) between the two groups over the entire 24 h period of the study. Three patients in Group A (17.6%) and three (10.0%) in Group B suffered major or other important bleeding.

We aimed to define the optimal P(ET,CO(2)) level to exclude PE in patients evaluated for possible thromboembolism. 298 patients were enrolled over 6 months at a single academic centre. P(ET,CO(2)) was measured within 24 h of contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography, lower extremity duplex or ventilation/perfusion scan. Performance characteristics were measured by comparing test results with clinical diagnosis of PE. PE was diagnosed in 39 (13%) patients. Mean P( ET,CO(2)) in healthy volunteers did not differ from P( ET,CO(2)) in patients without PE (36.3+/-2.8 versus 35.5+/-6.8 mmHg). P(ET,CO(2 )) in patients with PE was 30.5+/-5.5 mmHg (p<0.001 versus patients without PE). A P(ET,CO(2)) of >or=36 mmHg had optimal sensitivity and specificity (87.2 and 53.0%, respectively) with a negative predictive value of 96.6% (95% CI 92.3-98.5).

Unfortunately the diagnosis is most often missed than it is made. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can dramatically reduce the mortality and morbidity. This study was done to evaluate the patients with acute PE, assess the utility of laboratory tests and potential of high resolution spiral computed tomogram angiography of pulmonary arteries (sCTPA) as the confirmatory diagnostic tool. Twenty six consecutive patients with acute PE admitted to CCU of Narayana Hrudayalaya of Banglore were followed prospectively. There were 15 male and 11 female (M:F=1:3:1); age range was 32-58 yrs.

D-dimer and cardiac troponin I (TnI) estimation and sCPTA done by contrast enhanced 64-slice spiral CT scanner in all patients. In addition to the typical findings of PE, sCTPA included and revealed features of cardiac and venous CT imaging. Doppler study of leg veins were done to exclude deep vein thrombosis. Trans-thoracic echocardiography assessed right ventricular dilatation and presence of pulmonary hypertension. Nineteen patients (73.0%) had sub-massive PE, 5 patients (19.2%) had non-massive and 2 patients (7.6%) presented with massive PE. A raised D-dimer (0.5mugm/ml) was found in all the cases (100.0%).

CD010864,0,7654693,0,Vesicle aggregation by annexin I: role of a secondary membrane binding site.,"Proteins of the annexin family bind to and aggregate secretion granules or liposomes in the presence of Ca2+. We investigated the mechanism of vesicle aggregation performing experiments in which annexin I bound to PS liposomes was allowed to aggregate additional liposomes. The protein was initially bound to PS liposomes in 50-100 microM Ca2+ under nonaggregating conditions; then further liposomes were added, and aggregation was started by increasing Ca2+ to 0.5-1 mM. Coaggregation between both liposome populations was followed using resonance energy transfer (RET) and turbidimetric techniques. In RET experiments, annexin I was bound to liposomes containing N-(7-nitro-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE), and the second liposome population contained lissamine-Rhodamine-PS. Coaggregation was estimated from NBD fluorescence quenching. Rapid fluorescence and turbidimetric changes were observed, demonstrating coaggregation between both populations of liposomes. Therefore, annexin I molecules may bind two membranes in a bivalent fashion. Rates of coaggregation were similar to the rates of aggregation observed when all vesicles contained protein, indicating that aggregation is mediated only by bivalent annexin I molecules. Thus, membrane aggregation is due to a secondary membrane binding site in annexin I. PS liposomes containing annexin I coaggregated with phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes, demonstrating that membrane-bound annexin I binds PC, in contrast with soluble annexin I. Secondary binding to PC was significantly slower than secondary binding to PS, pointing to the importance of negative charge in the secondary membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We used data collected in 3,306 consecutive patients with clinically suspected PE to recalculate the odds ratios for the variables in the rule, to calculate the proportion of patients with PE in the probability categories, the area under the ROC curve and the incidence of venous thromboembolism during follow-up. We compared these measures with those for a modified and a simplified version of the decision rule. In the replication, the odds ratios in the logistic regression model were found to be lower for each of the seven individual variables (p = 0.02) but the proportion of patients with PE in the probability categories in our study group were comparable to those in the original derivation and validation groups. The area under the ROC of the original, modified and simplified decision rule was similar: 0.74 (p = 0.99; p = 0.07). The venous thromboembolism incidence at three months in the group of patients with a Wells score < or = 4 and a normal D-dimer was 0.5%, versus 0.3% with a modified rule and 0.5% with a simplified rule. The proportion of patients safely excluded for PE was 32%, versus 31% and 30%, respectively. This study further validates the diagnostic utility of the Wells rule and indicates that the scoring system can be simplified to one point for each variable."

DNA methylation profiling of human placentas reveals promoter hypomethylation of multiple genes in early-onset preeclampsia. Eur J Hum Genet 2010;18:1006-1012 based on a Canadian population found the tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) gene to be hypomethylated in pre-eclampsia (PE) placentas and to be a potential prenatal marker for early onset PE. To further explore the role of TIMP3 in PE and to investigate whether the TIMP3 promoter shows the same methylation pattern in the Han Chinese population, we analyzed a complete methylation assay of TIMP3 including the promoter region studied in the Canadian report and the neighboring CpG island in placentas (cases n = 41, controls n = 22) maternal peripheral blood (cases n = 3; controls n = 6) and umbilical cord blood (cases n = 7; controls n = 8) using MassArray EpiTyper (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). Our results confirmed the finding of aberrant TIMP3 promoter methylation in PE placentas (mean = 0.405) compared with those in controls (mean = 0.534, P = 9.40 Ã 10(-7)). A tissue-specific methylation pattern between placentas (mean = 0.459) and bloods (mean = 0.961, P = 6.91 Ã 10(-13)) was also demonstrated in our clinical samples. Furthermore, a nearly 2-fold increase in TIMP3 expression for the hypomethylated promoter was found in PE placentas (P = 0.007), pointing to a negative relationship between TIMP3 methylation and the expression (R = -0.758, P = 0.029). In conclusion, we replicated the findings of Yuen et al. in our Han Chinese-based study, confirming that TIMP3 is likely to be involved in the etiology of PE and that hypomethylated and placenta-specific TIMP3 may be a potential marker for early diagnosis of PE in maternal plasma."

CD010864,0,20699253,0,The value of serum procalcitonin in differential diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and community-acquired pneumonia.,"Presence of high fever may cause confusion in differential diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) versus pneumonia. The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic value of serum procalcitonin (PCT) in differential diagnosis of PE and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A total of 24 patients with proven PE and 22 patients with CAP were included in the study. The study population was subdivided as PE patients with fever (group 1, n = 8) and without fever (group 2, n = 16); and CAP (group 3, n = 22). Serum PCT and systemic inflammatory markers were measured at the initial diagnosis and the third day of the treatment. The relation of PCT level with the other systemic inflammatory markers was investigated in each measurement point. The initial mean serum PCT level in group 3 (2.24 Â± 0.99 ng/mL) was statistically higher than group 1 (0.48 Â± 0.77 ng/mL) and group 2 (0.14 Â± 0.17 ng/mL; P = .000, .000, respectively). Procalcitonin level at the initial (2.24 Â± 0.99 ng/mL) and the third day of treatment (0.92 Â± 0.62 ng/mL) in group 3 showed a statistically significant reduction (P = .000). There were no statistically significant reduction in PCT levels by anticoagulation in groups 1 and 2 (P = .262, .119, respectively). Other systemic inflammatory markers including interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±) levels statistically significantly decreased with anticoagulant and antimicrobial therapy. This study suggested that serum PCT level may be valuable for differentiating PE patients with or without fever from patients with CAP."
CD010864,0,23291150,0,Hyponatremia and mortality: moving beyond associations.,"Acute hyponatremia can cause death if cerebral edema is not treated promptly. Conversely, if chronic hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly, osmotic demyelination may ensue, which also potentially is lethal. However, these severe complications of hyponatremia are relatively uncommon and often preventable. More commonly, hyponatremia predicts mortality in patients with advanced heart failure or liver cirrhosis. In these conditions, it generally is assumed that hyponatremia reflects the severity of the underlying disease rather than contributing directly to mortality. The same assumption holds for the recently reported associations between hyponatremia and mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, and myocardial infarction. However, recent data suggest that chronic and mild hyponatremia in the general population also are associated with mortality. In addition, hyponatremia has been associated with mortality in long-term hemodialysis patients without residual function in whom the underlying disease cannot be responsible for hyponatremia. These new data raise the question of whether hyponatremia by itself can contribute to mortality or it remains a surrogate marker for other unknown risk factors. We review hyponatremia and mortality and explore the possibility that hyponatremia perturbs normal physiology in the absence of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination."
CD010864,0,20664894,0,Clinical decision rule and D-dimer have lower clinical utility to exclude pulmonary embolism in cancer patients. Explanations and potential ameliorations.,"Patients with malignancy frequently present with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the safe and efficient combination of a clinical decision rule (CDR) and D-dimer test to rule out PE performs less well in patients with malignancy. We examined potential explanations and analysed whether elevating the D-dimer cut-off could improve the clinical utility. We used data on consecutive patients with suspected PE included in a multicenter management study. The performance of the Wells CDR and the D-dimer test was compared between patients with and without malignancy and multivariable analysis was used to compare the weights of the CDR variables. Furthermore, we combined the CDR (cut-off â¤4) with different D-dimer cut-off levels for the exclusion of PE. Of 3,306 patients with suspected PE, 475 (14%) had cancer. The Wells rule variables were less diagnostic in cancer patients. Increasing the D-dimer cut-off level to 700 Î¼g/l for all ages or using an age-dependent cut-off resulted in an increase in the proportion of patients in whom PE could be excluded from 8.4% to 13% and 12%, respectively. The corresponding false-negative rates were 1.6% (95% confidence interval 0.3-8.7%) and 0.0% (0.0-6.3%). The Wells CDR and D-dimer perform less well in patients with suspected PE if they have cancer. Individual variables in the Wells rule are less diagnostic in cancer patients than in non-cancer patients with suspected PE. A CDR combined with an age-dependent D-dimer cut-off shows a modest improvement of the strategy in cancer patients."

CD010864,0,15192162,0,Diagnosing pulmonary embolism.,"Objective testing for pulmonary embolism is necessary, because clinical assessment alone is unreliable and the consequences of misdiagnosis are serious. No single test has ideal properties (100% sensitivity and specificity, no risk, low cost). Pulmonary angiography is regarded as the final arbiter but is ill suited for diagnosing a disease present in only a third of patients in whom it is suspected. Some tests are good for confirmation and some for exclusion of embolism; others are able to do both but are often non-diagnostic. For optimal efficiency, choice of the initial test should be guided by clinical assessment of the likelihood of embolism and by patient characteristics that may influence test accuracy. Standardised clinical estimates can be used to give a pre-test probability to assess, after appropriate objective testing, the post-test probability of embolism. Multidetector computed tomography can replace both scintigraphy and angiography for the exclusion and diagnosis of this disease and should now be considered the central imaging investigation in suspected pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,11443990,0,Flotation with polyelectrolytes as a first step of a more sustainable wastewater treatment system.,"Within the framework of a research programme into more sustainable wastewater treatment systems based on physical-chemical pretreatment the application of dissolved air flotation (DAF) with polyelectrolytes as a primary treatment was investigated. Experiments with municipal wastewater were carried out in 2.5 I flotation batches and in a 100 I DAF pilot reactor. Two cationic polyelectrolytes (PEs) with molecular weights of 4 x 10(6) g/mol and 8 x 10(6) g/mol, were tested. The higher weight PE was more effective in removing turbidity and was used in the pilot experiments for coagulation/flocculation. Within the pilot system experiments the dry solids concentration of the float layer as well as the removal efficiencies of turbidity, CODparticulate, CODdissolved and nutrients, were studied. Typical results were that the obtained dry solids concentration of the floated sludge was 10%, when the float layer was removed after several hours. By using polyelectrolytes it was possible to remove more than 80% of CODparticulate and turbidity at dosages of 7-8 mg/g influent COD (i.e. 5 mg PE/100 NTU). The removal efficiency of CODdissolved was low. There was a proportional relationship between CODparticulate and turbidity. This led to the conclusions that by introducing a dosing control strategy based on continuous turbidity measurements a constant CODparticulate removal efficiency can be obtained."

Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a free-floating large thrombus traversing the right atrial cavity. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the presence of an unattached thrombus that originated from the most proximal part of the inferior vena cava. Multi-slice computed tomography of the chest and abdomen revealed the thrombus to start from the intra-hepatic part of the inferior vena cava and extend through the right atrium. It also demonstrated multiple thrombi in the pulmonary vasculature, the largest being in the right main pulmonary artery and its lower lobe branch. The patient was triaged for surgical embolectomy under cardio-pulmonary bypass. Follow-up trans-thoracic and transesophageal echocardiography confirmed adequate removal of the thrombus.

Blood samples were obtained prospectively at the time of angiography for suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism. Plasma was assayed for D-dimer by five different latex agglutination assays. Angiographic evidence of pulmonary emboli was found in 34% (35/ 103) of patients. The latex agglutination assays had sensitivities of 97 to 100% and specificities of 19 to 29%. The negative predictive value was 94 to 100%. However, a negative D-dimer was rare in patients with recent surgery, malignancy, or total bilirubin > 34 micromol/L (> 2 mg/dl). In 31 patients suspected of pulmonary emboli but without these confounding factors, the five D-dimer assays were negative in 46 to 55% of patients with normal pulmonary angiograms. The negative predictive value in these patients was 100% by all five latex agglutination assays tested. The latex agglutination assays for D-dimer, when the pulmonary angiogram is used as the diagnostic endpoint and in the absence of recent surgery, malignancy, or liver disease, appears to be a clinically useful test in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism."

In patients with recurrence, results of both tests were significantly higher on admission, and FDP/fdp values were significantly higher throughout ten days of therapy, than in patients without recurrence. The SFC values were not different between the two groups during the first six days of treatment, but again became significantly higher on the seventh day in patients with recurrence. There were no differences in clotting times, heparin dosage, or any other clinical features between patients with and without recurrence. Measurement of FDP/fdp and SFC can help identify patients at risk of recurrent thromboembolism if performed serially during treatment."
CD010864,0,17917731,0,When to perform CTA in patients suspected of PE?,"Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) is a common disorder which may be associated with high morbidity or mortality when left untreated. Specific VTE diagnosis is mandatory, as treatment is associated with significant side effects. Therefore, timely diagnostic tests are necessary to establish the presence or absence of VTE. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has reached a high accuracy in the evaluation of pulmonary embolism (PE). Unfortunately, the continuous decrease of the prevalence of PE in the most recent studies can lead to cost-efficacy imbalance and overuse of ionizing radiation when CTPA is used as a single test. Therefore, no single non-invasive test is suitable for all patients and diagnostic strategies based on sequential non-invasive tests are likely to identify patients in whom anticoagulation can be withheld safely and limit the number of patients requiring more invasive or more expensive tests. The cost effectiveness of clinical stratification and D-dimer test has been demonstrated as it reduces the requirement for invasive tests. In this paper, the current role of CTPA in the diagnosis of PE will be reviewed."

CD010864,0,12738357,0,Estimation of the relative affinity of B cell receptor by flow cytometry.,"We have developed a simple method using flow cytometry to estimate the relative affinity of B cell receptor (BCR) possessing the hapten-binding activity. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was conjugated with a hapten, (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl (NP) and biotin (NP-BSA-bio). The interaction between NP-BSA-bio and anti-NP monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was studied as a model of the BCR reaction by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using a biosensor chip immobilized with mAbs through anti-Fc antibody (Ab). The relative affinity of these mAbs was estimated on the basis of resonance units for the binding of NP(0.5)-BSA-bio(21) relative to that of NP(7.4)-BSA-bio(21) expressed as a ratio (NP(0.5)-BSA-bio(21)/NP(7.4)-BSA-bio(21)). In combination with streptavidin (SA)-R-phycoerythrin (PE), we measured the binding of NP-BSA-bio to BCR by flow cytometry and found that a high number of biotin molecules was necessary to improve the sensitivity of detection of the bound NP-BSA-bio without steric hindrance in the NP-BCR interaction. We demonstrated that the ratio of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of NP(0.5)-BSA-bio(21)/NP(7.4)-BSA-bio(21) at a concentration of 10(-8) M could be used as a practical measure of the affinity.

Seven months before this inhibitor was diagnosed, surgery was complicated by prolonged bleeding resistant to FFP, requiring epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) and surgical packing. The inhibitor was measured at 2.2 Bethesda units, 7 months since the last FFP. The inhibitor was confirmed as specific anti-XI and anti-XIa binding by patient's IgG to immobilized factor XI and factor XIa from whole plasma and purified IgG. For repair of a painful anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) defect she was given recombinant factor VIIa (rVIIa) at 90 mug kg(-1), starting one-half hour preoperatively and continued every 2 h for 8 h when haemostasis was complete. Thereafter the rVIIa was given every 3 h for two doses, and then every 4 h for four doses at which time she was discharged on EACA which was continued for 6 days. There was excellent haemostasis during and following the surgery. There was no evidence of consumptive coagulopathy, with no change in the fibrinogen, platelet count, or D-D dimer; and no increase of platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, or prothrombin fragment F 1.2. The thrombin-antithrombin complex increased over baseline after 24 h. There was no postoperative deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. In this patient with a factor XI inhibitor, the recombinant factor VIIa was effective and safe, ensuring adequate haemostasis with no thrombotic complications.

Up to 25 percent of pleural effusions can remain undiagnosed with an unclear pathogenesis. Therefore new biological markers may increase diagnostic yield and provide better understanding of pathogenesis of pleural effusion. We hypothesized that new ischemia biomarker, ""ischemia modified albumin (IMA)"" would help in both the differentiation of the underlying etiologies and provide a better understanding of pathogenesis of pleural effusions. This study was done between December 2009 and September 2010 in the Department of Pulmonary Diseases of Gaziantep University Hospital. One hundred and sixteen subjects with pleural effusion were included. Pleural and blood IMA levels were measured by ELISA. The underlying etiologies of pleural effusions were as follows: transudates (n = 50), malignancy (n = 32), tuberculosis (n = 12), pulmonary thromboembolism (n = 6), pneumonia (n = 16). The median pleural IMA levels were significantly different between the groups (p < 0.000). There were no such differences in the blood levels of IMA. The most striking difference in the median pleural IMA levels was between transudates and exudates (7986 (25-75%, 5145-56.505) ng/mL; 3376 (25-75%, 1935-4660) ng/mL; respectively, p = 0.000). The area under the ROC curve was 0.837 Â± 0.038 for the cut-off level higher than 4711 ng l/mL for the differentiation of transudates from exudates (sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 78%; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.91; p = 0.0000). In conclusion, the pleural IMA levels are higher in transudates compared to exudates. No such differences were observed in blood levels of IMA suggesting that there are reasons other than ischemia that cause an increase in pleural fluid IMA levels."

The objective of this study was to develop proof-of-principle data for a thrombogenic PS liposome targeted to vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) via the attachment of an anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody (Ab). We have evaluated binding of the anti-VCAM-1 Ab-conjugated PS liposomes to VCAM-1 using two in vitro models, as well as assessing the ability of these liposomes to catalyze blood coagulation reactions. Binding of the Ab-conjugated PS liposomes containing 2 or 14 mol% 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[poly(ethylene glycol) 2000] (DSPE-PEG(2000)) to interleukin 1alpha stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells was 8- and 16-fold higher than those without conjugated Ab, respectively, based on the percentage relative increase in cell associated lipid for these liposomes. Binding to VCAM-1-coated ELISA plates produced similar results. The VCAM-1-bound Ab-conjugated PS liposomes were capable of catalyzing blood coagulation reactions upon the exposure of the thrombogenic PS membrane surface. This control of PS surface exposure was achieved using exchangeable PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamines (PE-PEG), with 97% of clotting activity recovered after PE-PEG exchanged out.

After initiating cytostatic chemotherapy with adriamycin, the highly molecular split products X and Y increasingly appeared at the initial stage. They disappeared with progressing therapy. 4. Under streptokinase therapy a characteristic redistribution of the FSP-pool from predominantly highly molecular fragments at the initial stage to lower molecular ones could be observed with falling SCT values and constant RPZ after approximately 48 hours."

CD010864,0,8034985,0,Detection of antiphospholipid antibodies by immunostaining on thin layer chromatography plates.,"There is increasing interest in the role of antiphospholipid antibodies in the so-called 'antiphospholipid antibody syndrome' (APS). The two major methods currently employed for detecting the autoantibodies are the solid phase ELISA and the LAI test (inhibition of phospholipid dependent coagulation assay). In our study we have tested the possibility of detecting antiphospholipid antibodies by immunostaining on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates, since this technique permits the use of pure phospholipid molecules as antigen. Sera were collected from 20 patients with SLE without APS, 20 patients with APS, 20 anti-HIV positive subjects, ten patients with signs of APS but antiphospholipid negative (ELISA), 20 patients with syphilis and 40 matched blood donors. Results showed that only 72.3% of sera containing detectable levels of aCL antibodies in solid phase ELISA were also positive for aCL in TLC immunostaining; these discrepancies may be due to the presence of antibodies reacting with a protein complexed with phospholipid (beta 2-glycoprotein-I) or, alternatively, to the different antigenic presentation of phospholipids on chromatograms compared to the surface of microtitre wells. Furthermore, aCL monoclonal antibody CAL-3, as well as nine sera positive for aCL, also reacted with PS and PE. Previous absorption of these sera with CL micelles completely abolished the reactivity with PS and PE, demonstrating cross-reactivity among these three phospholipids. In conclusion, our findings reveal that TLC immunostaining is more specific, but less sensitive, than ELISA for the detection of antiphospholipid antibodies in human sera."

The present study investigated the cardiac pathophysiology employing quantitative mRNA measurement of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) in the myocardium as markers of cardiac strain, using autopsy materials consisting of acute ischemic heart disease (AIHD, n=40) with/without the pathology of apparent myocardial necrosis (n=19/21), recurrent myocardial infarction (RMI, n=19), chronic congestive heart disease (CHD, n=11) and right ventricular cardiomyopathy (RVC, n=5), as well as hemopericardium (HP, n=11) due to myocardial infarction (n=5) and aortic rupture (n=6), and acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE, n=5). Cardiac death groups showed higher ANP and/or BNP mRNA expressions in the left ventricle than acute fatal bleeding (sharp instrumental injury; n=15) and/or mechanical asphyxiation (strangulation; n=10). AIHD and RMI cases had similar ANP and BNP mRNA expressions in bilateral ventricular walls, but their bilateral atrial levels were lower in RMI. RVC showed higher mRNA expressions of posterior left ventricular BNP, and right ventricular and bilateral atrial ANP and BNP. HP cases had lower BNP mRNA expression in the right ventricular wall, but PTE showed lower ANP and BNP mRNA expressions in the left ventricular wall; however, these mRNA expressions at other sites were similar to those of AIHD. CHD presented findings similar to those of AIHD, but the pericardial BNP level was significantly increased. These observations indicate characteristic molecular biological responses of myocardial natriuretic peptides in individual heart diseases and suggest the possible application of molecular pathology to demonstrate cardiac dysfunction even after death."

Cell death can also be induced by chemotherapeutic agents. We investigated PNLs in 99 patients with primary breast cancer, 26 with recurrent disease, 11 with benign breast disease, and 27 with other histological types of cancer. In 18 patients with recurrent breast cancer who received docetaxel (D, 60 mg/m2) every 3 weeks as second line therapy after an anthracycline-based regimen, PNLs were investigated before and during the administration of D. One hundred and seventy-four healthy controls (111 females, 63 males) without any evidence of disease were also investigated. PNLs were detected using the cell death detection ELISAplus kit. PNLs were significantly higher in patients with primary breast cancer (mean +/- SD: 0.135 +/- 0.213) and in recurrent breast cancer (0.182 +/- 0.196) as compared with healthy female controls (0.010 +/- 0.012) (p < 0.01). In patients with primary breast cancer, no correlation was found between PNLs and clinicopathological characteristics. On the other hand, PNLs were decreased after mastectomy (p < 0.05). Patients with other histological types of cancer (0.244+/-0.383) also showed significantly higher PNLs as compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01), and PNLs were elevated independently of the histological type of cancer. In patients with recurrent breast cancer, PNLs showed a transient increase 24 h after the administration of D, and these increases correlated with the degree of subsequent leukopenia. In a follow-up study, pretreatment baseline PNLs decreased markedly when a response was obtained, whereas there was no decrease in either stable disease or progressive disease. Thus, increased PNLs were found in cancer patients, and PNLs seem to be a sensitive marker of cell death that could be predictive of both leukopenia and response to chemotherapy."

Patients with pulmonary embolism also underwent echocardiography and NT-pro-BNP/troponin I serum level measurements. Three different CT measurements were obtained (right ventricular (RV)/left ventricular (LV)(axial), RV/LV(4-CH) and RV/LV(volume)). CT measurements and NT-pro-BNP/troponin I serum levels were correlated with RVD at echocardiography. 77 patients with RVD showed significantly higher RV/LV ratios and NT-pro-BNP/troponin I levels compared to those without RVD (RV/LV(axial) 1.68 Â± 0.84 versus 1.00 Â± 0.21; RV/LV(4-CH) 1.52 Â± 0.45 versus 1.01 Â± 0.21; RV/LV(volume) 1.97 Â± 0.53 versus 1.07 Â± 0.52; serum NT-pro-BNP 6,372 Â± 2,319 versus 1,032 Â± 1,559 ng Â· L(-1); troponin I 0.18 Â± 0.41 versus 0.06 Â± 0.18 g Â· L(-1)). The area under the curve for the detection of RVD of RV/LV(axial), RV/LV(4-CH), RV/LV(volume), NT-pro-BNP and troponin I were 0.84, 0.87, 0.93, 0.83 and 0.70 respectively. The combination of biomarkers and RV/LV(volume) increased the AUC to 0.95 (RV/LV(volume) with NT-pro-BNP) and 0.93 (RV/LV(volume) with troponin I). RV/LV(volume) is the most accurate CT parameter for identifying patients with RVD.

CD010864,0,468663,0,Effect of heparin or fibrinogen depletion on lung fluid balance in sheep after emboli.,"Investigators have proposed that fibrinogen, fibrin, or their degradation products are essential for the increased lung vascular permeability to fluid and protein that may occur after microemboli. To test this hypothesis, we used 20 anesthetized ventilated sheep in which we measured lung lymph flow, pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures, thermodilution cardiac output, and lymph/plasma protein concentrations. We injected glass bead microemboli (200 micrometers diam) sufficient to raise pulmonary vascular resistance to three times base-line values and cause increased lung lymph flow with a parallel increase in protein clearance, which is characteristic of increased lung vascular permeability. Neither large doses of heparin (3,000 U/kg) nor fibrinogen depletion with viper venom (ancrod, 2 U/kg), by themselves, affected steady-state pulmonary hemodynamics or lung fluid balance. These treatments prior to giving sufficient amounts of emboli to triple the pulmonary vascular resistance did not prevent the increased lung vascular permeability. We conclude that neither fibrin deposition nor degradation are essential to microembolic lung vascular injury in sheep."

CD010864,0,15063569,0,In vivo electroporation of skeletal muscles increases the efficacy of Japanese encephalitis virus DNA vaccine.,"DNA vaccines can induce protective immunity against subsequent viral challenge. However, for some DNA vaccines to be effective when administered intramuscularly, cardiotoxin pretreatment is necessary. In this study, we used the technique of in vivo electroporation to facilitate DNA delivery and elicit an immune response without the use of cardiotoxin. Intramuscular delivery of DNA (pE) encoding the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) envelope protein-induced anti-E antibodies only when the injected muscles were pretreated with cardiotoxin. In vivo electrotransfer of pE eliminated the need for cardiotoxin pretreatment and produced higher antibody titer than that induced by conventional intramuscular injection. Moreover, the induced immunity also conferred protection against lethal viral challenge. Interestingly, like intramuscular immunization, in vivo electroporation immunization with plasmid pE generated anti-envelope antibodies that were predominantly of the immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) isotype. These results suggest that in vivo electroporation can be used as an efficient gene delivery system for DNA vaccines to provide efficient protection against viral infection."
CD010864,0,21386068,0,Long-term management of venous thromboembolism: a 61-year-old woman with unprovoked venous thromboembolism.,"Numerous randomized clinical trials have compared various durations of anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist (ie, warfarin) for an initial episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Despite major advances in understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and its genetic basis, clinical risk factors at presentation have emerged as the primary determinant of recurrence risk. Following a minimum of 3 months of anticoagulant therapy, patients with VTE in association with transient risk factors (eg, major surgery, trauma, pregnancy) have a low annual recurrence risk, while patients without identifiable provocative risk factors have a recurrence risk of approximately 25% at 4 years with the highest annual rates occurring in the first 2 years. Extending warfarin therapy is highly effective in preventing recurrences but is associated with increased rates of major and minor bleeding. Clinical decision making therefore requires individualized assessment of recurrence and bleeding risk, coupled with patient preference. After 3 months of anticoagulant therapy for a first episode of unprovoked VTE, male sex, age older than 65 years, and an elevated D-dimer level 1 month after discontinuing anticoagulant therapy are useful parameters in identifying patients with an increased recurrence risk. The case of Ms W, a woman with unprovoked venous thromboembolism and hemorrhagic event while receiving anticoagulation, is used to illustrate clinical decision making to determine ongoing treatment."

CD010864,0,18211260,0,Circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin at 23-25 weeks of pregnancy in women with impaired placentation and in those with established fetal growth restriction.,"Adiponectin and leptin, two adipose-tissue-derived proteins, have been reported to be elevated in women with established PE (pre-eclampsia). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether alterations in adiponectin and leptin levels predate the development of PE and FGR (fetal growth restriction) in women at increased risk of these complications, as assessed by Doppler examination of the uterine arteries during the second trimester of pregnancy. We also sought to investigate the circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin in women with established severe early-onset FGR. The study included three groups of pregnant women at 23-25 weeks: Group A (n=44) with normal uterine artery Doppler waveforms, Group B (n=49) with abnormal Doppler waveforms and normal fetal growth at the time of the examination, and Group C (n=15) with established severe FGR and abnormal Doppler waveforms. All women had plasma adiponectin and leptin measured by sensitive immunoassays. In Group B, 19 women had a normal outcome, 17 delivered infants with FGR and 13 developed PE. The women who developed PE delivered smaller babies earlier than women with a normal outcome (P<0.001). There were no significant differences in adiponectin levels between any of the groups (overall P=0.3). Leptin concentrations, expressed as MoM (multiples of the median) of Group A, were higher in women in Group C, i.e. established severe FGR at 2.5 (1.2-2.7) MoMs (overall P<0.001), compared with all of the other groups and subgroups. In conclusion, we found that, in pregnancies complicated by severe early-onset FGR, the maternal plasma concentration of leptin is twice as high as in normal pregnancies. However, the second trimester levels of maternal plasma adiponectin and leptin in pregnancies that subsequently develop PE and/or FGR are not significantly different from normal and, consequently, it is unlikely that these markers will be useful as predictors of these pregnancy complications."

The value of the TT was compared to that of fibrin(ogen), degradation products (FDP), and ethanol gelatin test (EGT) in various diseases (group I), in confirmed deep venous thrombosis (group II), and in confirmed pulmonary embolism (group III). In 211 consecutive patients admitted for various diseases the results of the TT, FDP, and EGT were abnormal in 12.3, 11.3, and 66.6%, respectively, of the cases. In 59 consecutive patients with deep venous thrombosis confirmed by radiological phlebography the results of TT, FDP, and EGT were abnormal at admission time in 96.6, 89.8, and 44%, respectively, of the cases. In 45 consecutive patients with pulmonary embolism confirmed by lung scintigraphy the results of TT, FDP, and EGT were abnormal at admission time in 97.7, 97.6, and 88%, respectively, of the cases. Among the three parameters which were evaluated, the TT seems to be the most sensitive screening procedure for thrombotic diseases.

CD010864,0,15935031,0,The challenge of diagnosing pulmonary embolism in elderly patients: influence of age on commonly used diagnostic tests and strategies.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal disease if left untreated. The prevalence of PE increases markedly with age, and its diagnosis in elderly people is difficult because many cardiopulmonary conditions may mimic clinical presentation of PE, and age may unfavorably influence the characteristics of diagnostic tests for PE. The modern approach to PE is based on sequential diagnostic strategies based on clinical probability, D-dimer measurement, lower limb compression ultrasonography, ventilation-perfusion lung scan, and helical computed tomography (hCT). Pulmonary angiogram is rarely necessary because the noninvasive diagnostic evaluation is usually conclusive. Age reduces the clinical usefulness of D-dimer and ventilation-perfusion lung scan. D-dimer allows excluding PE in only 5% of patients aged 80 and older, compared with 60% younger than 40. Similarly, the rate of inconclusive ventilation-perfusion lung scans is almost twice as high (58%) in patients older than 70 and in patients younger than 40 (32%). In contrast, aging does not change the diagnostic accuracy of clinical probability assessment, whether empirical or as determined by prediction rules, nor appear to influence the diagnostic characteristics of lower limb compression ultrasonography and hCT. Therefore, a rational diagnostic approach to PE in older people should rest mainly on the sequential use of those tests that have demonstrated strong diagnostic yield, accuracy, and safety in this population."
CD010864,0,19538465,0,Reduction of circulating soluble Flt-1 alleviates preeclampsia-like symptoms in a mouse model.,"Preeclampsia (PE) is characterized by widespread endothelial damage with hypertension, proteinuria, glomeruloendotheliosis and elevated soluble Flt-1 (sFlt-1), a natural occurring antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Cancer patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy exhibit similar symptoms. We suggested that a decrease in circulating sFlt-1 would alleviate the symptoms associated with PE. Adenoviral (Adv) overexpression of sFlt-1 induced proteinuria, caused glomerular damage and increase in blood pressure in female Balb/c mice. Circulating level of sFlt-1 above 50 ng/ml plasma induced severe vascular damage and glomerular endotheliosis. Albumin concentration in urine was elevated up to 30-fold, compared to control AdvGFP-treated animals. The threshold of kidney damage was in the range of 20-30 ng/ml sFlt-1 in plasma (8-15 ng/ml in urine). Co-administration of AdvsFlt-1 with AdvVEGF to neutralize circulating sFlt-1 resulted in more than a 70% reduction in free sFlt-1 in plasma, more than 80% reduction in urine and rescued the damaging effect of sFlt-1 on the kidneys. This demonstrates that below a critical threshold sFlt-1 fails to elicit damage to the fenestrated endothelium and that co-expression of VEGF is able to rescue effects mediated by sFlt-1 overexpression."

CD010864,0,15226698,0,"[Diagnostic and therapeutic progress.

REGARDING TREATMENT: Indications for thrombolysis are currently limited to massive pulmonary oedema with shock. Alteplase added to heparin improves the progression of severe embolism; it spares the patients from heavy interventions of resuscitation but the mortality remains the same. Concerning anticoagulant treatments, prolonged antivitamin K at classical doses is more effective than low doses and for limited duration if phlebitis is an idiopathic one. FOR HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION: Treatment of these heart failures, formerly know as 'diastolic' is similar to that of the acute phase of systolic heart failure. However, care should be taken with vasodilatators. CONCERNING HEART FAILURE IN GENERAL: The brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) represents a remarkable progress for the aetiological diagnosis of dyspnoea (inferior to 80 pg/ml in the case of pulmonary origin, superior to 300 pg/ml in the case of cardiac origin or severe pulmonary embolism). Regarding treatment, for acute heart failure, it is still the association of nitrates and diuretics, with oxygen therapy and eventually inotropics. Beta-blockers, which have revolutionized the treatment of chronic heart failure, must be maintained whenever possible in the case of the onset of acute pulmonary oedema. Multisite pacing is increasingly used in refractory chronic heart failure. Implantable defibrillation has become common practice. Non-invasive ventilation (Bi or C-PAP) is interesting in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. THE PREVENTIVE ROLE OF N ACETYL-CYSTEINE: N acetyl cysteine reduces the incidence of nephropathies induced by the radio contrast products in patients with chronic kidney failure. Combined with hydratation, it must be proposed the day before and on the day of the procedure in any patient with diabetes or kidney failure."

Only patients with a high clinical probability and both tests negative, or positive D-dimer and negative US assessments, underwent CT. This was deemed necessary in 114 patients (42%). At baseline, venous thromboembolism (VTE) was detected in 110 patients (40%), either by US showing proximal (n=65) or distal (n=36) thrombosis, or by CT (n=9). Anticoagulant was withheld in the remaining patients with negative results in both D-dimer and US but a non-high clinical probability (n=59), or in both US and CT (n=90), or with negative US (n=6) and inadequate CT (n=9). All patients underwent a three-month clinical follow-up. VTE occurred in one patient with inadequate CT, yielding an incidence of 0.6% [95% confidence interval: 0.1-3.4]. No patient died from VTE or had major bleeding. Using clinical probability, ELISA D-dimer and complete US before helical CT is a safe strategy resulting in a substantial reduction in CT scans."

In some instances, aPE is the sole antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) observed. Lupus anticoagulant antibodies (LA) appear to represent a subset of aPE as hexagonal phase PE can specifically inhibit the LA ability to prolong clotting times. As documented for aPL to the negatively charged phospholipids (PL), plasma proteins have been implicated for a positive aPE signal in the ELISA. Other aPE appear independent of known PE-binding plasma proteins. Among the described PE-binding proteins are high and low molecular weight kininogens (HMWK and LMWK) and the HMWK-binding proteins, factor XI and prekallikrein. Recently prothrombin has been added to this list. The reports of aPE published since 1986 are reviewed and discussed in this presentation."

In France, imaging diagnosis is essentially based on complete Doppler sonographic evaluation of both lower limbs. In patients with no co-morbid condition, the D-dimer assay is useful to exclude the possibility of DVT. A positive diagnosis of DVT is based on the lack of venous compressibility and abnormal Doppler signal. The diagnostic accuracy relies on adequate knowledge of vascular anatomy and sufficient training, especially at the calf level. For experienced sonographers, the accuracy is similar at the thigh and calf level. In patients with suspected pulmonary embolus, evaluation of the lower extremity veins is mandatory and frequently performed with CT immediately following CT pulmonary angiography. However, this examination has not been validated yet."

Donor animals were sacrificed with an intravenous injection of potassium chloride without heparinization and were divided into three groups. In group 1 (n = 6), cadavers were left at room temperature for 1 hour, and lung retrieval was then performed after flushing the lung block with low potassium-dextran-glucose solution. Donor lungs were stored for 3 hours at 8 degrees C. In group 2 (n = 6), donor lungs were treated as in group 1 except that the cadavers were left at room temperature for 2 hours instead of 1 hour before lung retrieval. In group 3 (n = 6), donor lungs were treated as in group 2 except that high-dose urokinase (120,000 IU) was injected into the main pulmonary artery after flushing with low-potassium-dextrose-glucose solution. In all groups after left lung transplantation, the right pulmonary artery was ligated, and recipient animals were followed up for 6 hours after reperfusion. The fibrin degradation product level in the donor lung tissue was also measured. All recipient animals in group 1 survived the 6-hour observation period with excellent gas exchange and stable hemodynamics. Group 3 had significantly better gas exchange than group 2 and similar cardiopulmonary function as group 1. The fibrin degradation product level in the donor lungs before transplantation was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010864,0,11001401,0,Generation of monoclonal antibodies directed against the immunogenic glycoprotein K8.1 of human herpesvirus 8.,"Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is clearly associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), body cavity-based lymphomas (BCBL), and certain forms of multifocal Castleman's disease (MCD). It appears to be the sexually transmissible agent involved in the development of AIDS-associated KS. HHV-8 genomes are invariably present in BCBL-derived cell lines where lytic replication of the virus can be induced by phorbol esters (PE). First-generation HHV-8 serological assays were based on these cell lines. More recently, several genes encoding HHV-8 antigens have been identified. One of the most reactive antigens is encoded by HHV-8 open reading frame K8.1. Although K8.1 does not exhibit overt sequence homology to any other known gene, it is likely to be analogous to gp220/350 of Epstein-Barr or gp150 of murine herpesvirus-68, virion-envelope glycoproteins involved in target cell recognition. Mice were immunized with purified GST-K8.1 fusion protein expressed in E. coli. After fusion of murine plasma cells with the myeloma cell line P3-X63-Ag8. monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were generated, which are specifically directed against K8.1 protein. The binding site for each MAb was identified by deletion mutant analysis using recombinant GST-K8.1 mutants and K8.1-specific peptides. Without exception, the epitopes recognized by these MAbs were located within the N-terminal part of the protein [amino acids (aa) 29 to 80], thus identifying a highly immunogenic region. These antibodies will not only be useful tools for HHV-8 diagnostics, but will also facilitate the analysis of K8.1 function."

Currently, both imaging modalities and serology are utilized. These plasma molecules are regarded as the biomarkers of DVT including D-dimer, P-selectin, Factor VIII, thrombin generation, inflammatory cytokines, microparticles, fibrin monomer, leukocyte count and so on.

To overcome this major limitation for vaccine development, we immunized mice with three cysteine-rich interdomain 1 (CIDR1) domains of PfEMP1 that have the critical function of binding the PE to CD36 on endothelium and thus preventing spleen-dependent killing of the parasite. The immunizations consisted of different combinations of three CIDR1 encoded by DNA followed by recombinant protein boost. Immunizations with a single variant in a prime-boost regimen induced no or low cross-reactivity toward heterologous CIDR1; however, a broad range of crossreactivity was detected in mice that were immunized with all three variants simultaneously. The induced crossreactivity suggests that an anti-PfEMP1 vaccine may be possible."

We selected 177 necropsies of pediatric patients who died as a result of serious respiratory infections. The histopathological findings and epidemiological data were reviewed, and lung tissue samples were separated for immunohistochemistry testing. Conventional immunohistochemistry techniques were used to detect viral antigens in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FF-PE) lung tissue samples using a pool of monoclonal antibodies against respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, adenovirus, and parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3 viruses) as primary antibodies. The histopathological findings were classified into bronchopneumonia (BCP) and interstitial pneumonitis (IP) patterns. The immunohistochemistry results were compared with histopathological patterns and epidemiological data. Positive results for viruses were found in 34% and 62.5% of the BCP and IP cases, respectively. Males and infants below 1 year of age were more frequent in the group that had positive results for viruses. Acute enteritis was the main cause of hospitalization and sepsis the most frequent cause of death in this group. A clear seasonal distribution was observed, with the majority of cases occurring in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters (autumn and winter) of each year in the period studied. Immunohistochemistry is an affordable and easy-to-perform method for viral-antigen detection in FF-PE tissue samples. Although BCP is a classic histopathological pattern found in bacterial infections, it is possible that children with serious respiratory infections had concomitant viral and bacterial infections, regardless of their previous immunologic state."

Preclinical PE cohort included 149 women whose serum samples were collected at 8-14 gestational weeks and in whom 30 women later developed mild and 40 severe PE. Serum proteome was analyzed and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used for protein quantification. In Clinical PE, fibronectin, pappalysin-2, choriogonadotropin-beta, apolipoprotein C-III, cystatin-C, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, and endoglin were more abundant compared to normotensive women. In preclinical PE, differently expressed proteins included placental, vascular, transport, matrix, and acute phase proteins. Angiogenic and antiangiogenic proteins were not significant. We conclude that placental and antiangiogenic proteins are abundant in clinical PE. In preclinical PE, proteomic profile is distinct and different from that in clinical PE."
CD010864,0,2289288,0,Interaction of dextran sulfate with phospholipid surfaces and liposome aggregation and fusion.,"The binding of dextran sulfate to phospholipid liposomes was investigated by microelectrophoresis experiments.

If positively charged stearylamine is incorporated in the vesicles dextran sulfate is bound without Ca2+. Negatively charged phospholipids as PS do not bind dextran sulfate, even in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Ca2+. The adsorption of dextran sulfate results in an aggregation of vesicles due to a bridging mechanism. In all cases the aggregation is followed by a disaggregation toward higher dextran sulfate concentrations. The disaggregation process starts at polymer concentrations smaller than the concentration of the onset of saturation of the adsorption. By use of the probe dilution method a fusion of small DMPC and DMPC/PE vesicles in the presence of Ca2+ and dextran sulfate was found."

Alternatives to these methods are needed for those patients whose sputum tests are smear or culture negative. Here, we examine anti-phospholipid IgM antibody level changes as a biomarker for treatment response in smear positive TB patients. Serum samples were obtained from 40 pulmonary TB patients at the start and end of the intensive phase treatment (IPT) from the CDC-TB Trials Consortium randomized clinical trial in Kampala, Uganda. Samples were screened by ELISA for IgM levels against five phospholipids found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and host cells. Lipid antigens included cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidyl inositol (PI), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), phosphatidyl choline (PTC), and sphingolipid (SL). Levels of IgM against all phospholipids significantly decreased (pÂ =Â 0.034, 0.001, 0.008 0.008, 0.040, respectively) following anti-TB drug treatment in patients without lung cavitary disease at baseline. The mean sensitivity of this test in these patients was 83% when the IgM response to a single lipid antigen was used; it was >90% when responses to 2 or more lipids were assessed. In contrast, cavitary TB patients showed an overall IgM increase, with a significant rise against PE (pÂ =Â 0.025). There was no significant difference in the change in antibody levels between patients who remained culture-positive and those who culture-converted after 40 doses of drug therapy. The measurement of IgM anti-phospholipid antibodies may be a useful biomarker to monitor treatment response in non-cavitary TB patients."

Because of the effects of IFN-gamma on macrophage activation and immunoglobulin isotype selection, offspring were now studied to ascertain whether this intervention modifies the in vitro replication of T. cruzi and nitric oxide (NO) production by peritoneal macrophages (PE), together with the anti-T. cruzi IgG isotypes. To evaluate the possibility of a detrimental effect of IFN-gamma, serum levels of anti-sulphatide autoantibodies were also investigated. Offspring were born to mothers undergoing one of the following procedures during gestation: treatment with recombinant rat IFN-gamma, 50,000 IU/rat, five times/week for 3 weeks, which was started on the day of mating; infection with 10(6) trypomastigotes of T. cruzi at 7, 14, and 21 days after mating plus IFN-gamma treatment as given to the former group; the same protocol except that physiological saline was injected instead of IFN-gamma; injection of physiological saline only. Offspring were challenged at weaning with a similar dose of T. cruzi, to constitute four groups of infected young, plus an additional group of age-matched uninfected rats born to control mothers. PE were harvested at day 7 postinfection (pi), exposed to parasites and further investigated for the replication of T. cruzi and NO production, whereas ELISA studies for measuring serum anti-T. cruzi IgG subclasses and anti-sulphatide autoantibodies were performed at day 30 pi. The number of intracellular parasites in PE was markedly decreased in young born to IFN-gamma-treated mothers, this not being accompanied by higher nitrite levels in culture supernatants. Offspring delivered by IFN-gamma-treated mothers showed no higher serum concentrations of anti-sulphatide autoantibodies, but exhibited a preferential synthesis of anti-T. cruzi IgG2b antibodies. This rat isotype is known to fix complement and constitutes the rat counterpart of IgG2a mouse immunoglobulins whose synthesis is favoured by IFN-gamma."

Flow cytometry was used for studies on binding of soluble fibrinogen and coaggregation, whereas ELISA wells were used to study binding of microvesicles to immobilized fibrinogen. Biotinylated microvesicles produced by stimulation with A23187, thrombin or SFLLRN of platelets which had been surface-labelled with biotin, were used both for the coaggregation experiments and for the binding studies with immobilized fibrinogen. Unlabelled microvesicles and biotinylated fibrinogen were employed when studying binding of soluble fibrinogen to the microvesicles. For the flow cytometry, the biotinylated proteins were reacted with avidin or streptavidin which was PE-conjugated, whereas the same substances were conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for the ELISA studies. The microvesicles formed after stimulation of platelets by SFLLRN or A23187 clearly bound the soluble, biotinylated fibrinogen. Moreover, isolated biotinylated microvesicles added to washed platelets prior to activation, were associated to the microaggregates that formed after stimulation. A significant binding of biotinylated microvesicles to immobilized fibrinogen could also be detected. The binding of microvesicles to soluble and immobilized fibrinogen and association to platelets was clearly specific and at least partly dependent on the GPIIb-IIIa complex, as all of these phenomena could be prevented or reduced by addition of the c7E3 Fab which blocks the activated form of this receptor complex. From these in vitro results it is clear that microvesicles can bind to immobilized fibrinogen, bind soluble fibrinogen and are able to coaggregate with platelets. It may be speculated that these results also reflect a haemostatic role of microvesicles in vivo."
CD010864,0,8457646,0,Automated determination of cross-linked fibrin derivatives in plasma.,"Automated assays for the measurement of cross-linked fibrin derivatives in plasma (XL-FbDP) have been developed utilizing latex beads coated with anti-D dimer monoclonal antibody (DD-3B6/22) for both the Cobas Fara Chemistry Centrifugal and the Cobas Mira analysers (Roche, Basle, Switzerland). The analysers were programmed to mix plasma and latex reagent simultaneously and analyse absorbance changes over a 10-15 min period. Results were interpolated by the analyser from a standard curve derived from a polymer of D-dimer. Both assays had high precision (< 5% CV) for values between 100 and 1000 ng/ml and provided clear discrimination between normal samples and samples from patients suffering from the thrombotic diseases, DVT/PE and DIC. The results obtained for XL-FbDP determination with both methods compared well with established methods: a high correlation was obtained with a semi-quantitative manual latex method for both the Fara (r = 0.92) and Mira (r = 0.83) and correlations (r) of 0.81 (Fara) and 0.84 (Mira) were obtained with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA).

CD010864,0,1861105,0,[Value of the plasma measurement of D-dimers in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism].,"Plasma measurement of D-dimers (DD), which are fibrin-specific degradation products, progressively replaces the cumbersome dosage of fibrinogen degradation products (FDP's) in serum for diagnosis and follow-up of consumption coagulopathies, for diagnosis of prethrombotic states and, potentially, for the control of the efficacy of antithrombotic therapies. Moreover, when the ELISA technique is used, this measurement may be very useful in the diagnosis approach of venous thromboembolic disease. In the present review, data are presented which strongly support the view that a low level of plasma D-dimers (less than 500 micrograms/L when using the ELISA from Stago) allows to exclude the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism with predictive values of 94 % and 100 % respectively. It is suggested that such a diagnostic potential might be very useful in the group of patients with inconclusive perfusion-ventilation scintigraphy (low or indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism) which represent about 50 % of the patients with suspected pulmonary embolism."

Few studies have evaluated the utility of measuring PE-1 in duodenal fluid for the diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency. Our purpose was (1) to determine the feasibility of measuring PE-1 concentrations in duodenal aspirates obtained through our endoscopic pancreatic function test (ePFT) in healthy subjects and patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and (2) to determine correlations between duodenal PE-1 concentrations and bicarbonate and lipase concentrations in duodenal fluid. Healthy subjects (HS) and CP patients underwent an ePFT with CCK or secretin. CP was defined as endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) Cambridge class III-IV, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) score >5, or presence of pancreatic calcifications on CT scan. Duodenal fluid PE-1, lipase, and bicarbonate concentrations were measured in each study group. Duodenal lipase and bicarbonate concentrations were measured using an autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). PE-1 was measured using an ELISA (Genova Diagnostics, Asheville, NC). Ten HS and 10 CP patients were studied. In the CCK test the median peak lipase for HS and CP was 1605 and 113 IU/L, respectively (P < 0.008). In the secretin test the median peak bicarbonate for HS and CP was 102 and 40 mEq/L, respectively (p < 0.008). Median PE-1 concentrations for HS and CP were 317 and 63 microg/ml, respectively, after CCK stimulation (p = 0.046) and 87 and 17 microg/ml, respectively, after secretin stimulation (p = 0.033). Statistically significant correlations were found between [PE-1] and peak [lipase] (r = 0.83, P < 0.001), as well as [PE-1] and peak [HCO3(3)-] (r = 0.65, P = 0.037). Conclusions are as follows: (1) PE-1 concentrations can be measured from duodenal fluid obtained by endoscopic aspiration. (2) Duodenal fluid PE-1 concentrations are decreased in CP compared to HS. (3) Duodenal fluid [PE-1] has an excellent correlation with [lipase] and therefore is a marker of acinar cell function. (4) Secretin-stimulated endoscopic function testing with measurement of bicarbonate and PE-1 may provide a simultaneous assessment of both ductal cell and acinar cell function."
CD010864,0,12871550,0,Kininogen domain 3 contains regions recognized by antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies.,"Antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies (APE) have been described in patients with thrombotic diseases and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). It has been reported that certain APE are not specific for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) per se, but are directed to PE-binding plasma proteins, called kininogens. Our recent in vitro data suggest that APE may recognize the domain 3 (D3) region of kininogens. In this study, we have used synthetic peptides that span the D3 of kininogens in inhibition and direct binding studies to identify epitopes that are sites for binding APE. Our present data demonstrate that among 24 RPL patients who were positive for kininogen-dependent immunoglobulin (IgG) APE, 17 patients (70.8%) recognized the LDC27 peptide. We mapped the APE-binding region on D3 using plasma from a RPL patient (X) who had a high titer of IgG APE that recognized LDC27. APE of patient X recognized a 13-residue segment in LDC27, named CNA13. Leu331-Met357 (LDC27) and Cys333-Lys345 (CNA13) are located on the carboxyl-terminal portion of kininogen D3, which is known as the major kininogen heavy chain cell attachment site where it overlaps its cysteine protease inhibitory region. Because APE interferes with the balance of hemostasis in vitro, APE may therefore induce a similar condition in patients thereby causing thrombosis and RPL."

CD010864,0,22428059,0,Differential expression of Vegfr-2 and its soluble form in preeclampsia.,"Several studies have suggested that the main features of preeclampsia (PE) are consequences of endothelial dysfunction related to excess circulating anti-angiogenic factors, most notably, soluble sVEGFR-1 (also known as sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng), as well as to decreased PlGF. Recently, soluble VEGF type 2 receptor (sVEGFR-2) has emerged as a crucial regulator of lymphangiogenesis. To date, however, there is a paucity of information on the changes of VEGFR-2 that occur during the clinical onset of PE. Therefore, the aim of our study was to characterize the plasma levels of VEGFR-2 in PE patients and to perform VEGFR-2 immunolocalization in placenta."

The newest methods available claim to be able to ascertain the absence of thrombosis, but they have yet to prove their efficiency. We compared the performances of 3 reference ELISA methods (D-DI Asserachrom Stago, D-dimer Enzygnost Behring and Dimertest GOLD EIA Agen), 5 recent rapid methods (VIDAS D-Dimer bioMÃ©rieux, Instant IA Stago, Simplired Agen, Nycocard D-dimer Nycomed and Accuclot D-Dimer Sigma Diagnostics) and two routine latex methods (Dimertest American Diagnostica and FDP-Slidex bioMÃ©rieux) in 100 patients. One of the rapid quantitative methods was demonstrated to have a level of efficiency comparable to that of ELISA methods. Finally, the cost and efficiency of different strategies were evaluated, the association of a routine latex method with the VIDAS D-Dimer bioMÃ©rieux being proven to be the most efficient."

The mean levels of the three markers remained significantly increased throughout the period of observation, except for F 1 + 2 on day 9, when compared to normal values established in a population of normal healthy blood donors. However, whereas heparin significantly decreased the plasma levels of F 1 + 2 and of TAT complexes in less than 3 d. D-dimer levels were not significantly altered. Significant correlations were observed between the plasma levels of the three markers but they were not correlated to the actual intensity of heparin treatment evaluated as the activated partial thromboplastin time prolongation. These results indicate that heparin improves the hypercoagulable state associated with a deep vein thrombosis within the first days of treatment as indicated by TAT and F 1 + 2. They also account for the performances of D-dimer assay for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in patients already receiving heparin, a common situation in routine hospital practice."
CD010864,0,23159397,0,Systemic effects induced by the venom of the snake Bothrops caribbaeus in a murine model.,"Snakebite envenoming by Bothrops caribbaeus, an endemic viperid from the Lesser Antillean island of Saint Lucia, is clinically characterized by local tissue damage and systemic thrombosis that can lead to cerebral, myocardial or pulmonary infarctions and venous thromboses. Systemic effects (lethality, pulmonary hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy) induced by intravenous (i.v.) administration of B. caribbaeus venom were studied in mice. The role of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) in these systemic alterations was assessed by inhibition with the chelating agent calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaNa(2)EDTA). A snake C-type lectin-like (snaclec) and a type P-III hemorrhagic SVMP were isolated and characterized from this venom, and the effect of venom and the isolated snaclec on human platelet aggregation was studied inÂ vitro. Results indicate that SVMPs play an important role in the overall toxicity of B.Â caribbaeus venom, being responsible for systemic hemorrhage and lethality, but not thrombocytopenia, whereas the isolated snaclec is involved in the thrombocytopenic effect. Both venom and snaclec induce platelet aggregation/agglutination. Moreover, the snaclec binds directly to glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) and induces agglutination in washed fixed platelets. On the other hand, B. caribbaeus venom hydrolyzed fibrinogen inÂ vitro and induced a partial drop of fibrinogen levels with an increase in fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) levels inÂ vivo. The negative result for D-dimer (DD) in plasma is consistent with the lack of microscopic evidence of pulmonary thrombosis and endothelial cell damage. Likewise, no increments in plasma sE-selectin levels were detected. The absence of thrombosis in this murine model suggests that this effect may be species-specific."

CD010864,0,15771357,0,[Diagnosis of suspected deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism during pregnancy].,"Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) is a frequent clinical problem during pregnancy and post-partum. Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains the most common cause of mortality during pregnancy and post-partum in western countries. In the majority of cases, DVT may be diagnosed by non-invasive tests such as clinical probability, D-dimer measurement and venous compression ultrasonography. In contrast, at least one irradiating invasive exam is necessary in suspected PE. The lung scan, the most validated diagnostic test for PE during pregnancy and fetal irradiation is quite low, in particular if only perfusion lung scan is used. Helical computed tomography (hCT) has widely replaced lung scan in the diagnostic approach of suspected pulmonary embolism. However, it has never been validated in pregnant women."
CD010864,0,1959391,0,Pulmonary embolism. Efficacy of D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin III complex determinations as screening tests before lung scanning.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate if D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin III complex determinations in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism create a discrimination between patients to be further investigated with lung scanning and those who should be investigated for other diseases mimicking pulmonary embolism. The Data-Fi Dimertest Latex Assay, MAbCO Dimertest EIA, and TAT EIA were performed in 100 consecutive patients (26 percent outpatients) who were sent to our institution for lung scanning by their attending physicians because of clinically suspected pulmonary embolism. The D-dimer Latex Assay was positive (greater than 500 ng/ml) in 12 (48.0 percent) of 25 patients with high probability of pulmonary embolism and in one (11.1 percent) of nine with intermediate probability, respectively. Only one patient (1.5 percent) with a normal scan had a positive latex assay, presumably due to inapparent bleeding after a computed tomographic (CT)-guided liver biopsy. Referring to 120 ng/ml as upper limit of normal (mean +/- 2 SD of healthy controls), the D-dimer enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was positive in 21 (84.0 percent) of 25 patients with high probability, in six (66.7 percent) of nine patients with intermediate probability, and in 40 (60.6 percent) of 66 patients with normal/low probability of pulmonary embolism, respectively. The TAT EIA was positive (greater than mean +/- 2 SD of healthy controls = 3.53 ng/ml) in 18 (72.0 percent) of 25 patients with high probability, in five (55.6 percent) of nine patients with intermediate probability and in 16 (24.2 percent) of 66 patients with normal/low probability of pulmonary embolism. A normal result in one of these hemostaseologic tests did not predict a low probability of pulmonary embolism after lung scanning. Thus, it is not justified to exclude patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism from further investigation by lung scanning because of a normal result in one of these tests."

CD010864,0,9545339,0,Characterization of V3 loop-Pseudomonas exotoxin chimeras. Candidate vaccines for human immunodeficiency virus-1.,"To develop a candidate vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), chimeric proteins were constructed by inserting sequences derived from the V3 loop of gp120 into a nontoxic form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). Inserts of 14 or 26 amino acids, constrained by a disulfide bond, were introduced between domains II and III of PE. V3 loop-toxin proteins expressed in Escherichia coli and corresponding to either MN (subtype B) or Thai (subtype E) strains, were recognized by strain-specific monoclonal anti-gp120 antibodies. When loop sequences were introduced into an enzymatically active form of the toxin, there was no loss of toxin-mediated cell killing, suggesting that these sequences were co-transported to the cytosol. Sera from rabbits injected with nontoxic PE-V3 loop chimeras were reactive for strain-specific gp120s in Western blots, immunocapture assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and neutralized HIV-1 infectivity. Since toxin vectors were designed to receive oligonucleotide duplexes encoding any V3 loop sequence, this approach should allow for the production of V3 loop-toxin chimeras corresponding to multiple HIV isolates."

The assay results were compared with those of the Stratus II and the Dimension RxL-HM. A between-run imprecision CV < 20% was found at a cTnI concentration of 0.23 microg/L (functional limit of detection). On the basis of a reference study including 215 patients without ischemic heart disease (97.5th percentile: 0.294 microg/L) and 36 patients clinically classified as having stable angina pectoris (<0.22 microg/L) a preliminary cutoff level of 0.3 microg/L was defined. Assay linearity, sample stability, influence of sample material and method comparison studies were performed. In patients with Duchenne's disease, chronic hemodialysis treatment, pulmonary embolism, coronary artery bypass surgery and minimally cardiac surgery the cTnI results of the IMMULITE agreed better with the Dimension RxL-HM than with the Stratus II data. Of 142 samples from patients with unstable angina 67 samples were classified as cTnI positive with the IMMULITE, 76 with the Dimension RxL-HM, and 62 with the Stratus II. In conclusion, the new assay is sensitive for the determination of cTnI and easy to perform within 45 min."
CD010864,0,8030366,0,Intracellular immunization of mosquito cells to LaCrosse virus using a recombinant Sindbis virus vector.,"A cDNA of the small RNA genome segment of La Crosse (LAC) virus was inserted, in an antisense orientation, into a double subgenomic Sindbis (dsSIN) virus expression vector generating pTE/3'2J/ANTI-S (15,000bp). In vitro transcription of the pTE/3'2J/ANTI-S template generated genomic RNA that was electrotransfected into BHK-21 cells to produce virus. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from infected Aedes albopictus (C6/36) cells showed that the TE/3'2J/ANTI-S virus produced a subgenomic mRNA of the appropriate size, indicating transcription of the LAC cDNA segment. C6/36 cells were infected with either TE/3'2J/ANTI-S, TE/3'2J (a dsSIN virus with no LAC insert), or wild type Sindbis (SIN, strain AR339) viruses and subsequently challenged with LAC virus. LAC virus titers were determined using a capture antibody ELISA. Mosquito cells infected with TE/3'2J/ANTI-S virus yielded at least 4 log10 TCID50/ml less LAC virus than cells infected with either TE/3'2J or AR339 SIN viruses. The use of the infectious SIN virus expression vectors provides a novel approach for high level cytoplasmic expression of genes or sequences of interest in arthropod cells, and for evaluating strategies for intracellular immunization against arboviruses."

All of them were admitted with signs of severe heart and/or respiratory insufficiency, and 12 (30%) of the patients required mechanical ventilation. The concentration of FDP/fdp was significantly higher in 28 of 29 patients with positive arteriography (mean 145 microgram/ml), that in those whose arteriography was negative (in every cases the FDP/fdp level was lower than 10 microgram/ml). To help differentiate pulmonary embolism from other acute heart or pulmonary diseases, the authors measured the FDP/fdp in 10 patients with bacterial pneumonia, 24 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 4 patients with extrinsic asthma, and 18 normal control subjects. The authors found high levels of FDP/fdp (more than 10 microgram/ml) in only 2 patients with pneumonia and in 6 with myocardial infarction. In no case was the level of FDP/fdp higher than 40 microgram/ml. On the other hand, in patients with pulmonary embolism, 23 (79%) had levels higher than 40 microgram/ml. The study indicates that this test is a helpful screening method for pulmonary embolism, especially in situations where other emergency diagnosis tests are inconclusive or impractical; it also provides justification for beginning anticoagulant therapy and for recommending pulmonary arteriography."

CD010864,0,20426764,0,Quantification of intracellular proteins and monitoring therapy using flow cytometry.,"Here we review phospho-specific, quantitative flow cytometry approach as a rapid and reliable tool for measuring intracellular signaling proteins with potential applications in monitoring efficacy of targeted therapy. The single cell, multiparameter nature of flow cytometry allows simultaneous investigation of specific cell type and the corresponding intracellular markers. Peripheral blood can be directly stained with surface markers to delineate cell populations of interest, followed by fixation, permeabilization, and immunostaining with specific antibodies to the cellular targets. By using calibrated standardized phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated beads for signal quantification, an informative Index value can be generated for each sample by multiplication of percentages of positive cells with fluorescence intensity per cell. This technique can yield both qualitative and quantitative information on effects of cellular markers upon targeted therapy, thereby providing another layer of advantages over the conventional flow cytometry analysis.

One model proposes that specialist academic centers should primarily construct valid guidelines for various topics in medicine (top-down model). An alternative model integrates ""the best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values"" (bottom-up model). Whereas the former model inherently implies a central specialized process, the latter implies that practitioners working in nonspecialist centers can learn and implement a standardized set of tools with which to ask a question, search and appraise the literature, and then apply best current evidence in a local setting. This article focuses on appraising the literature and applying retrieved results and is part of a series on EBP in radiology. This article describes a clinical scenario in which a new respirologist at a hospital requests indirect computed tomographic (CT) venography as part of a work-up of a patient with a high pretest probability for pulmonary embolism and a positive d-dimer test result. Many controversies surround the technique of indirect CT venography, and difficult topics such as this are ideally suited to the tools of EBP. This article will describe how to approach such a scenario."
CD010864,0,12595883,0,Nondietary ingestion of pesticides by children in an agricultural community on the US/Mexico border: preliminary results.,"An environmental measurement and correlation study of nondietary ingestion of pesticides was carried out in a colonia in south Texas. The purpose of the study was to evaluate young children's exposure to environmental levels of organophosphate (OP) pesticides in the household. Samples were collected to measure levels of OP pesticides in housedust and on children's hands. These, in turn, were compared to levels of OP pesticide metabolites in urine. A total of 52 children, 25 boys and 27 girls, participated in the spring and summer of 2000. The children were 7-53 months of age at the time of recruitment. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were carried out using SAS statistical software. Seventy-six percent of housedust samples and 50% of hand rinse samples contained OP pesticides. All urine samples had at least one metabolite and over 95% had at least two metabolites above the limit of detection (LOD). Total OP loadings in the housedust ranged from nondetectable (nd) to 78.03 nmol/100 cm(2) (mean=0.15 nmol/100 cm(2); median=0.07 nmol/100 cm(2)); total OP loadings on the children's hands ranged from nd to 13.40 nmol/100 cm(2) (mean=1.21 nmol/100 cm(2); median=1.41 nmol/100 cm(2)), and creatinine corrected urinary levels (nmol/mol creatinine) of total OP metabolites ranged from 3.2 to 257 nmol/mol creatinine (mean=42.6; median 27.4 nmol/mol creatinine). Urinary metabolites were inversely associated with the age of the child (in months) with the parameter estimate (pe)=-2.11, P=0.0070, and 95% confidence interval -3.60 to -0.61. The multivariate analysis observed a weak association between concentrations of OP pesticides in housedust, loadings in housedust, and concentration on hands, hand surface area, and urinary levels of OP metabolites. However, hand loadings of OP pesticides were more strongly associated (r(2)=0.28; P=0.0156) with urinary levels of OP metabolites (pe=6.39; 95% CI 0.98-11.80). This study's preliminary findings suggest that surface loadings of pesticides, on hands, are more highly correlated with urinary bioassays and, therefore, may be more useful for estimation of exposure in epidemiologic studies than levels of pesticides in housedust."

Forty sera from patients with either autoimmune disorders including antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) or the clinical features of APS only were assayed by ELISA performed under different conditions. Variables were sources of PE (egg yolk, soybean, bovine brain or Escherichiacoli), microtiter plates (plain or gamma irradiated) and buffer components-fetal calf serum (FCS), adult bovine plasma (ABP), adult bovine serum (ABS) or bovine serum albumin (BSA). aPE binding was decreased with PE from E. coli while the other tested PE gave comparable results. The influence of the type of plates was restricted to IgM isotype with slightly, but significantly higher optical densities with plain than with irradiated plates. Most importantly, the component buffer had the highest impact on the results as shown by a strong decrease of the signal by ABP or ABS. This inhibitory effect was confirmed by using mixtures of FCS or BSA with increasing concentrations of ABS. Partial delipidation of ABS resulted in a recovery of OD levels close to those obtained with FCS. This study is the first to demonstrate that aPE reactivity is dependent on the lipid concentration of the buffer component. These results highlight the need for standardization of aPE-ELISA for a better understanding of their clinical significance."
CD010864,0,3971042,0,"Specific identification of fibrin polymers, fibrinogen degradation products, and crosslinked fibrin degradation products in plasma and serum with a new sensitive technique.","A new method is described for identifying low concentrations of circulating derivatives of fibrinogen and fibrin, even when present in heterogeneous mixtures. This technique is applicable to plasma and serum and uses electrophoresis in 2% agarose in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) followed by immunological identification of separated derivatives, using radiolabeled antifibrinogen antiserum and autoradiography. Unique electrophoretic patterns distinguish plasmic derivatives of crosslinked fibrin from those of fibrinogen and also identify crosslinked fibrin polymers produced by the combined action of thrombin and factor XIII on fibrinogen. The assay is sensitive to a concentration of 0.1 micrograms/mL of fibrinogen in serum or plasma. Fibrin polymers, plasmic degradation products of fibrinogen, and plasmic degradation products of crosslinked fibrin were detected in the plasma or serum of a patient with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Plasmic derivatives of both fibrinogen and crosslinked fibrin appeared in serum in the course of fibrinolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism, whereas during acute myocardial infarction a marked increase in the proportion of fibrin polymers in plasma was found in comparison with normal controls. Thus, the procedure can distinguish between the simultaneous processes of fibrin polymer formation, fibrinogenolysis, and fibrinolysis, and is sufficiently sensitive to detect relevant quantities of derivatives in pathologic conditions."

Points to look for are: (1) Ninety percent or more of patients with pulmonary embolism have known predisposing factors. (2) Eighty percent or more complain of dyspnea and exhibit hyperpnea (eg, respiratory rate > 20 breaths per minute). (3) Chest roentgenogram abnormalities occur in more than 80% of patients. (4) Seventy percent to 90% of patients complain of chest pain. (5) Either the pCO2 is low or the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient is high in more than 95% of cases. (6) Twenty percent of patients have normal pO2. (7) Anxiety is present more often than not, and, if present, is no reason to dismiss the cause as ""hyperventilation syndrome."" Pulmonary arteriography is the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis, although the combination of ventilation/perfusion scan and noninvasive leg vein studies may decrease its use. An experimental test, the immunosorbent plasma D-dimer assay, seems a promising future screening tool if its reportedly high sensitivity is confirmed. Transthoracic or esophageal echocardiology, if immediately available, may have a place in assessing patients who present with cardiovascular collapse. Early and adequate heparinization coupled with the use of intravenous heparin protocols should lower future mortality rates. Food and Drug Administration approval of low-molecular-weight heparin and heparinoids may revolutionize the management of routine thromboembolism, as these substances are easier to use and less hazardous. A recent British study showed no advantage to anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks for patients with perioperative thrombophlebitis and no other risk factors. In selected cases, thrombolytic therapy, vena caval filters, and invasive embolectomy have been shown to decrease both short- and long-term mortality."

CD010864,0,17175010,0,Performance evaluation of a new rapid quantitative assay system for measurement of D-dimer in plasma and whole blood: PATHFAST D-dimer.,"D-dimer is an indicator for in vivo fibrin formation, reflecting the formation of fibrin crosslinked by factor XIIIa. D-dimer assays are frequently used in emergency situations, such as diagnosis of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, or disseminated intravascular coagulation. In these conditions, short sample turnaround times are essential. The PATHFAST D-dimer assay allows rapid quantitative measurement of D-dimer in plasma and whole blood. The study shows an excellent correlation between whole blood and plasma measurement of D-dimer both in the high range, as well as in the normal range. Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were below 10%. The upper limit of normal (ULN = mean value measured in 100 samples from healthy blood donors + 2 x S.D.) was approximately 1 microg/ml FEU, using the assay-specific calibration. The maximal value measured in 20 replicates of calibrator 1 containing no D-dimer antigen was 0.00052 microg/ml FEU, and this 10-fold lower than the declared detection limit of 0.005 microg/ml FEU. In conclusion, the PATHFAST D-dimer assay is the first automated fully quantitative D-dimer assay, which can use plasma and whole blood as sample materials in parallel."
CD010864,0,2328157,0,Selective killing of HIV-infected cells by anti-gp120 immunotoxins.,"Either ricin A chain (RAC) or Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) was conjugated with a murine monoclonal antibody (0.5 beta) directed against an external envelope glycoprotein (gp120) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Effects of the immunotoxins produced against infected cells were evaluated. Selective inhibition of the proliferation and killing of chronically HIV infected cells were observed in the presence of the immunotoxins. To determine the feasibility of the immunotoxins against the infected cells in seropositive subjects, we attempted to detect gp120-bearing cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) by cytofluorography. Cells in the monocyte/macrophage region of 2 of 10 PBM samples from HIV-infected individuals were found to react with 0.5 beta (18.1% and 12.8%). Furthermore, the cell population which was reactive with 0.5 beta was also susceptible to RAC conjugated with 0.5 beta. These results suggest that the strategy of using anti-gp120 immunotoxin to eliminate HIV-infected cells may be feasible in infected individuals."

CD010864,0,12171400,0,Regrowth and survival of indicator microorganisms on the surfaces of household containers used for the storage of drinking water in rural communities of South Africa.,"The present study covered two rural communities of South Africa: Ncera and Ntselamanzi villages. Raw water from Ncera river is used by the community of Ncera village for drinking, while the community of Ntselamanzi receives their drinking water from Alice purification system. Treated water is supplied to the community by a public standpipe system. In rural communities of South Africa, many households use polyethylene (PE) and galvanized steel (GS) containers for the storage of their drinking water. To investigate the regrowth and survival of indicator microorganisms on the surface of household containers during the storage of drinking water, PE and GS slides were suspended in the appropriate household containers for a period of 48 h. This period of 48 h was chosen as the study period because results from the questionnaire indicated that the largest percentage (62%) of households store their water for that length of time. The experiment was performed to test drinking water as it is collected and stored by rural communities. No disinfection of household containers or slides was done during the study period. Attached coliphages (F-RNA (FP) and somatic phage (SP), coliform bacteria (total coliform (TC), presumptive Escherichia coli (EC), Salmonella (Sal) and Clostridium perfringens (CP) were measured during the study period. With the exception of CP, attached indicator microorganisms consisted of TC, presumptive E. coli and Salmonella, somatic and F-RNA coliphages, although the yield (average count) for the last four groups (EC: < 1-3 cfu cm(-2), Sal: < 1-15 cfu cm(-2), FP: < 1-7 pfu cm(-2), SP: < 1-7pfu cm(-2)) was lower than that of TC (3-183 cfu cm(-2)). However, the lowest yield of indicator microorganisms was noted for presumptive E. coli. Whereas the occurrence and survival of TC was noted on the surface of household containers during the entire period of the experimental study, other indicator microorganisms occurred from time to time. The regrowth of indicator microorganisms occurred 48 h after the exposure of slides to both types of test waters. This length of time mostly resulted in the regrowth of TC (with an increase in bacterial counts) while the persistence of other indicator organism groups on the surface of the slides was apparent. A comparison between PE and GS containers showed that more TC (average count) regrew on PE than on GS containers (for river water, PE: from 36 to 55 cfu cm(-2), GS: from 25 to 26 cfu cm(-2); for standpipe water, PE: from 147 to 183 cfu cm(-2), GS from 3 to 4 cfu cm(-2)). This study revealed that both types of household containers supported the growth and survival of indicator microorganisms due to the bad quality of the intake water before storage. The storage of drinking water for 48 h mainly resulted in the regrowth of TC. Nevertheless, the persistence of other indicator microorganisms was observed on the surface of household containers."
CD010864,0,11029354,0,A noninvasive diagnostic strategy including spiral computed tomography in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.,"We conducted a study to evaluate a noninvasive strategy including spiral computed tomography (CT) in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). We systematically performed spiral CT, ventilation/perfusion lung scanning, and D-dimer (DD) measurement (VIDAS test), and in some cases (with a normal CT with nondiagnostic lung scan and increased DD) performed venous ultrasonography (US) on 247 consecutive patients with clinically suspected PE in our hospital. Patients in whom PE was deemed absent were not given anticoagulants. All patients were followed for 3 mo. The prevalence of PE in the 228 patients who could be evaluated was 42% (96 of 228). PE was confirmed by spiral CT in 73% of the patients, by a high-probability lung scan in 4%, and by findings on US in 23%. PE was ruled out by a normal lung scan in 14% of the patients, by a normal DD concentration (< 500 ng/ml) in 31%, by an obvious differential diagnosis on spiral CT in 18%, by a similar prior lung scan in 11%, and by the combination of normal spiral CT findings, a nondiagnostic lung scan, a DD concentration > 500 ng/ml, and normal US in 26%. Pulmonary angiography was performed in only two patients, both of whom had a normal spiral CT scan and a high-probability lung scan, and was normal. The 3-mo risk of thromboembolism in patients not given anticoagulants, based on the results of the diagnostic protocol, was 1.7% (95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 2.3%). There were no deaths. The noninvasive strategy of combining spiral CT, lung scanning, DD measurement, and in some cases US, in patients with suspected PE yielded a definite diagnosis in 99% of patients, and appeared to be safe."

CD010864,0,12431472,0,Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnancy.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Because unrecognized and untreated pulmonary embolism (PE) can result in maternal mortality, physician vigilance for this disease should remain high. The diagnosis of both PE and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the pregnant patient, as in the nonpregnant patient, requires the use of accurate objective imaging. However, unlike the nonpregnant population, there is a paucity of trials evaluating the safety and accuracy of objective testing for PE or DVT diagnosis in pregnant patients--likely because of concerns surrounding the use of ionizing radiation associated with diagnostic tests during pregnancy. Regardless of extrapolating results from studies in the nonpregnant population, the use of compression leg ultrasound and ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scanning during pregnancy is central to the diagnosis of DVT and PE, respectively. Data on the utility of structured clinical models or D-dimer testing for the diagnosis of DVT or PE during pregnancy is currently unavailable. Future research is urgently needed to validate the use of current approaches and perhaps define safer and more accurate strategies to reduce maternal morbidity from this disease."

CD010864,0,10605769,0,D-dimer testing in the diagnosis of acute venous thromboembolism.,"Patients with acute VTE require clinical assessment and objective testing to be accurately diagnosed. Almost all patients with acute VTE have an elevated D-dimer level. An elevated D-dimer is associated with many illnesses, and therefore, is not specific for VTE. D-dimer tests can have a high sensitivity, however, which is useful because a normal test excludes the diagnosis of VTE. D-dimer testing is most appropriate in the assessment of outpatients because the prevalence of disease and the likelihood of comorbid conditions are lower than in inpatient populations, making a test of exclusion particularly valuable. Accuracy studies using conventional ELISA assays have confirmed that a test with a high sensitivity can be used to exclude a diagnosis of VTE, but conventional ELISA testing is not practical. Studies of more practical D-dimer testing indicate that, for patients with suspected DVT or PE, the need for serial testing or further investigation can be reduced if normal results are obtained using assays with a high sensitivity. There are, however, many sources of variation in the test characteristics of D-dimer assays. Therefore there is no reassurance that results from one manufacturer's test are applicable to other tests and different investigators may obtain varied results when using the same manufacturer's product. In addition, the results of D-dimer accuracy studies lack generalizability. This lack of generalizability has led to the recommendation that clinicians await the results of management studies before adopting the routine use of D-dimer assays in the diagnosis of VTE. Further, it may be reasonable to perform an accuracy study when planning to adopt a specific D-dimer assay from a published management trial, to be confident of its characteristics can be reproduced. In the management of patients with suspected DVT, rapid ELISA tests show promise as a practical D-dimer test, in that they have a sensitivity similar to that of the conventional ELISA assay. Two management studies have recently confirmed that a normal D-dimer result (using the SimpliRED whole-blood assay or the Instant IA rapid ELISA) in combination with a noninvasive test or a clinical model can reliably exclude DVT in outpatients. Use of a clinical model can reduce the need for VU, and the combination of a clinical model and D-dimer testing could further reduce the number of VU procedures required. As noted by Wells et al, who recently published a clinical model, however, a normal D-dimer result was most accurate in the patients with a low pretest likelihood (NPV = 99.5%) and least accurate in patients with a high pretest likelihood (NPV = 85.7%) Patients with a low pretest likelihood and a normal D-dimer are the largest proportion of outpatients referred for testing, and considerable resources may be saved if additional management studies confirm the usefulness of D-dimer testing in such patients. In patients with suspected PE, there is a lack of published management trials despite a number of accuracy studies indicating that D-dimer testing may be useful as a method of PE diagnosis exclusion. Recent results, however, from an accuracy study of patients with suspected PE who had D-dimer testing complement the findings of Wells et al in patients with suspected DVT. Using a standardized clinical model of PE in combination with a SimpliRED D-dimer assay, Ginsberg and colleagues found that the combination of a low pretest likelihood and a normal D-dimer had a negative predictive value of 99%, whereas the negative predictive value was only 78% in patients with a high pretest likelihood and a normal D-dimer. Similar to the findings in DVT, these results indicate that D-dimer testing is most useful in patients with a low pretest likelihood for PE and raise the possibility that such patients may not require lung scans. This finding is currently being evaluated in a prospective management trial."

ANTELOPE Study Group. Advances in New Technologies Evaluating the Localization of Pulmonary Embolism.","In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), differentiating a pulmonary embolism (PE) from an exacerbation of COPD can be difficult, since clinical signs and symptoms of the two conditions overlap. Development of reliable noninvasive or minimally invasive techniques for the diagnosis of PE is, especially in these patients, necessary. In this study we assessed the effect of COPD on the accuracy of the clinical probability estimate (CPE), spiral computed tomographic angiography (SCTA), D-dimer analysis, ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy, and pulmonary angiography for the diagnosis of PE. From May 1997 through March 1998, 627 consecutive patients with suspected PE were investigated in six teaching hospitals. In these patients, D-dimer testing, CPE, V/Q scintigraphy, and SCTA and/or pulmonary angiography were performed according to a strict diagnostic protocol. The patients were also independently categorized as having COPD or not. A diagnosis of COPD was established in 91 patients (15%). The prevalence of PE was similar in patients with and without COPD (29% and 31%, respectively), notwithstanding the larger proportion of nondiagnostic V/Q scan results in patients with COPD (46% versus 21%, p < 0.001). The distribution of CPEs, diagnostic value of the D-dimer assay and SCTA, and reproducibility of pulmonary angiography were comparable among patients with and without COPD. The presence of COPD does not affect the diagnostic performance of CPE, D-dimer testing, SCTA, or pulmonary angiography. Furthermore, although more nondiagnostic V/Q scan results can be expected in the presence of COPD, V/Q scintigraphy remains a valuable screening test in patients with COPD."

Clinicians await a single diagnostic modality that accurately rules in or out pulmonary embolism and also provides additional diagnostic and prognostic information. Multislice computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (msCTPA) might be that test. msCTPA has good outcomes using current reference standards and can be used as a stand alone test in low risk patients. Additional leg vein imaging should still be performed for higher-risk patients. CT venography performed immediately after msCTPA has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for proximal deep venous thrombosis to allow a single scan to rule out venous thromboembolism in most patients. Up to 40% of patients have important alternative diagnoses seen on msCTPA. Right ventricular measurements may be calculated from msCTPA data and provide prognostic information for patients with severe PE. This may replace the need for echocardiography in the future. msCTPA provides a safe single radiological investigation for diagnosing PE for most patients, after risk stratification and D-dimer testing. A pathway is provided for msCTPA use in the management of PE in the ED."

CD010864,0,1304624,0,Use of dengue blot in dengue diagnosis: the Malaysian experience.,"Dengue fever/Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) has been a public health problem in Malaysia with an endemic level of about 7 per 100,000 population per year. In 1990, Malaysia experienced its most severe outbreak of DF/DHF with a record total of 5,590 cases referred to the Division of Virology, Institute for Medical Research (IMR). Of these, 1,880 were confirmed serologically to be DF/DHF. The conventional serological procedure, the Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) test, for the diagnosis of DF/DHF is cumbersome and causes delay in diagnosis. Another problem associated with the HI test has been that it has often been difficult to obtain a second convalescent serum sample for an accurate diagnosis. This has raised an urgent need to establish a ""rapid"" test for diagnosis of DF/DHF. As such the authors recently carried out an evaluation of a newly available commercial rapid test, namely, the Dengue Blot Assay (Diagnostic Biotechnology Singapore Pte Ltd). The test is intended for use in laboratory confirmation of dengue virus infection. The evaluation was to determine if the test could be utilised as a routine laboratory test and to establish its sensitivity and specificity. Over 400 samples were tested against the Dengue Blot Assay. Results were checked against an in-house Dengue IgM ELISA and HI assay. Preliminary results indicate that the sensitivity and specificity of the Dengue Blot is satisfactory. Our results also indicate that the Dengue Blot has a useful role to play in a routine laboratory especially since it provides rapid results on single serum samples thereby reducing the workload in a busy diagnostic laboratory."

Tests were positive significantly less often in high-risk patients, and mean values were significantly lower, when compared with patients with established pulmonary embolism (P less than .001). However, no significant differences existed between high-risk patients and patients with deep venous thrombosis of the legs. Positivity rates and mean values were significantly higher in the presence of pulmonary embolism than in patients with deep venous thrombosis alone (P less than .05). Elevated FDP/fdp and SFC values are useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in high-risk patients; moreover, positive results in a patient with deep venous thrombosis suggests that pulmonary embolism has occurred."

Whether creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) would add to the prognostic assessment is uncertain. We retrospectively assessed in-hospital mortality from PE in 392 stable patients to test the hypothesis that CK-MB would be of greater prognostic value than cTnI or RV size and we assessed whether combinations would increase prognostic value. CK-MB was high in 29 patients (7.4%); cTnI was high in 76 patients (19%) and intermediate in 78 patients (20%). The right ventricle was dilated in 128 patients (33%). Trends showed highest in-hospital mortality from PE in 4 of 29 (14%) with high CK-MB compared to 6 of 76 (7.9%) with high cTnI and 8 of 128 (6.3%) with RV dilatation (differences NS). High CK-MB and high cTnI provided added prognostic information only in patients with RV dilatation. Mortality with high CK-MB plus RV dilatation (4 of 19, 21%) tended to exceed mortality with high cTnI plus RV dilatation (5 of 39, 13%, NS). When CK-MB and cTnI were high and the right ventricle was dilated, PE mortality tended to be highest (4 of 14, 29%, NS). In conclusion, cardiac biomarkers contributed to prognosis only in patients with RV dilatation. CK-MB was the strongest predictor of death from PE but its prevalence was low, thus limiting its value as a single prognostic indicator. The combination of high CK-MB, high cTnI, and RV dilatation tended to indicate the highest mortality."

The study accrued 82 patients. There were 57 (70%) men and 25 (30%) women aged 16 to 86 years. Fifty-three patients were suspected of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and 29 of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). In 49 of the 82 patients, the use of USD, isotope phlebography, x-ray and ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy of the lungs made it possible to verify the diagnosis of VT. In one case, it was verified on autopsy. In 33 patients, the suspicions were rejected. The blood assay for D-dimer was performed using the kit Roche/Diagnostika Stago. The method is based on agglutination of latex particles covered by monoclonal antibodies to D-dimer. Among the 49 patients with a verified diagnosis of VT, D-dimer was positive in 44 (89.8%) and negative in 5 (11.4%) patients. In the group of the 33 patients, in whom the diagnosis of VT was rejected, D-dimer was negative in 26 (78.8%) and positive in 7 (21.8%) patients. Thus, the sensitivity of the assay for D-dimer constituted 89.8% and the specificity 78,8%. The high sensitivity of the assay provides an opportunity of using D-dimer measurement as a screening method in patients suspected of VT. Negative D-dimer is helpful in excluding VT.

Patients with AAD had significantly higher elevated D-dimer, compared to chronic aneurysms and normal controls (p<0.0001). D-dimer level higher than 700 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 59% for diagnosis of AAD. The WBC count was also significantly increased compared to the other groups (p<0.01). CRP and BNP values were significantly higher compared to normal controls but these parameters did not distinguish between AAD and chronic aneurysms.

The questionnaire contained questions regarding the available equipment suitable for the imaging diagnosis of PE, the first-line and second-line imaging tests for patients with suspected PE, and additional lower extremity venous imaging and laboratory tests that complement the diagnostic armamentarium. The return rate for questionnaires was 81% (127 of 157 hospitals). There were 97% of hospitals that had the equipment to perform sonography, 59% could perform pulmonary angiography, 54% spiral CT, 19% ventilation/perfusion (V/P) scintigraphy, and 4% perfusion scintigraphy alone. Spiral-CT angiography (SCTA) was the first-line imaging study for suspected PE in 56% of hospitals, followed by echocardiography and V/P scintigraphy. Lower extremity venous imaging (47%) and, interestingly, V/P scintigraphy (43%), served as second-line imaging tests. D-dimer tests were included in the diagnostic strategy in 74% of hospitals. Spiral-CT angiography is the most commonly used primary method for suspected PE in Austrian hospitals.

CD010864,0,15011226,0,A rapid quantitative turbimetric d-dimer assay has high sensitivity for detection of pulmonary embolism in the ED.,"Many rapid d-dimer assays are commercially available with wide ranges of reported sensitivities, often based on small sample sizes. This has limited their intended use as rapid and inexpensive tests to evaluate pulmonary embolism in the low-risk patient. We sought to determine the sensitivity of the STA-Liatest D-Di d-dimer assay in our ED. We performed a retrospective analysis of 103 patients seen in our ED with the admitting diagnosis of known or suspected pulmonary embolism. These charts were assessed to establish if a d-dimer assay was performed within 24 hours. These charts were then reviewed to determine what diagnostic studies were performed and what final diagnosis was reached. Of the 103 charts identified, 55 had d-dimer assays performed within 24 hours. Of those, 38 were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism; none had negative d-dimer assays (<400 ng/mL). Using the exact method, the sensitivity of this assay was calculated to be 100% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 91.4% to 100%. Our results suggest that the STA-Liatest D-Di d-dimer assay could have an adequate sensitivity to be used to rule out pulmonary embolism in low-risk patients. Further prospective studies with larger sample sizes are required to validate this observation."

CD010864,0,8841426,0,"Expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1), -beta 2, and- beta 3 by cultured human prostate cells.","Transforming growth factor beta s (TGF beta s) are members of a superfamily of polypeptides that control cell cycle progression and a variety of other cellular activities. TGF beta family members, -beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3, have been identified in prostate. The levels of expression of these TGF beta isotypes have been reported to vary with the pathologic state of the prostate. While the significance of these observations remains to be elucidated there is little doubt that TGF beta s play an important role in controlling growth of the prostate. The prostatic cells expressing TGF beta s have not been identified. This information would provide insight into the physiologic role of TGF beta s and suggest ways that growth control may be altered in prostate disease. We used stromal (PS) and epithelial (PE) cells, cultured from normal human prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), to study the effect of TGF beta s on cell proliferation and TGF beta transcript and protein expression. The proliferation of PS and PE was inhibited by pM quantities of TGF beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3. Both cell types expressed transcripts for all three TGF beta isotypes, but PS primarily secreted TGF beta 1, whereas PE secreted more TGF beta 2 than TGF beta 1. These observations suggest that TGF beta s are antiproliferative agents in vivo, and that the stroma is the source of TGF beta 1 while the epithelium is the major source of TGF beta 2 in prostate. There were no significant differences in the growth response to TGF beta s, the TGF beta-isotype expressed, or the amount of TGF beta secreted by cells cultured from normal prostate or BPH."

NIAID AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group.","We investigated the safety and immunogenicity of a candidate HIV-1 vaccine, Env 2-3 (Chiron Biocine Co.), in combination with an adjuvant emulsion, MF59, with or without an additional immune modulator, MTP-PE 78 healthy HIV-1-seronegative adults. Sixteen subjects participated in a dose escalation study of MTP-PE in MF59 without Env 2-3, given at 0 and 1 months; 48 subjects participated in a study of a fixed dose of 30 micrograms of Env 2-3 in MF59 with increasing doses of MTP-PE (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 micrograms), and 14 subjects participated in a study of 100 micrograms of Env 2-3 in MF59 without MTP-PE. Subjects were assigned to study groups under a randomized, double-blind allocation. Subjects received immunization at 0, 1, and 6 months, and had the option of receiving a fourth dose at 12-18 months. Env 2-3 in MTP-PE/MF59 was associated with significant reactogenicity, in that severe, although self-limited systemic and/or local reactions occurred in 15 of 30 vaccinees. In contrast, Env 2-3 in MF59 without MTP-PE was relatively well tolerated, and severe local and/or systemic reactions occurred in only 2 of 18 subjects. Env 2-3 stimulated serum antibodies to HIV-1 envelope protein (gp120) as detected by Western blot in 39 of 43 subjects and to HIV-1 virus lysate by EIA in 28 of 43 subjects after three injections. The majority of subjects also developed EIA antibodies to recombinant gp120 (SF-2), gp120 (LAI), and V3 peptide (SF-2). Neutralizing antibodies to the homologous SF-2 strain developed in 30 of 43 and 27 of 34 subjects, and fusion inhibition antibodies in 25 of 43 and 15 of 36 subjects after three and four injections, respectively. Lymphoproliferative responses to the immunogen, Env 2-3 were observed in over 80% of the vaccinees examined, and CD4+ cytotoxic T cell activity directed against HIV-1 was noted transiently in 2 of 20 vaccinees. Addition of MTP-PE to Env 2-3 or increasing the dose of Env 2-3 from 30 to 100 micrograms did not augment immunogenicity. Env 2-3 in MF59 was well tolerated and immunogenic in HIV-1-seronegative individuals. The addition of MTP-PE significantly increased reactogenicity, but had little, if any, effect on immunogenicity."
CD010864,0,3345298,0,Monoclonal antibodies to crosslinked fibrin degradation products (XL-FDP). II. Evaluation in a variety of clinical conditions.,"Plasmas from patients with a wide variety of thrombotic and presumed prethrombotic conditions were examined for high molecular weight crosslinked fibrin degradation products (known as X-oligomers) using a two-site enzyme-linked immunospecific assay (ELISA). This assay employed a catcher-tag principle using two monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed towards different epitopes on the complex X-oligomer fraction. In general, thrombotic events (pulmonary embolism, PE, myocardial infarction, MI, peripheral vascular disease, PVD, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, DIC) were accompanied by elevated levels of X-oligomers in the plasma. During pregnancy the value of X-oligomer assays was demonstrated to be a clear-cut marker for pre-eclampsia. Patients following a variety of forms of surgery present with heterogeneous plasma levels of X-oligomers and this may merely reflect the formation and lysis of the fibrin formed during and after surgery. The possible value of this ELISA procedure in monitoring thrombolytic therapy is discussed with a critical analysis of the data presented herein. While the assay of X-oligomer was demonstrated to be a valuable marker of fibrinolysis in plasma, more extensive data are required in order to assess whether such an assay is of diagnostic value in thrombosis-related conditions."
CD010864,0,20499069,0,Circulating endothelial microparticles in children with Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura; preliminary results.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of circulating endothelial microparticles (EMPs) in children with HSP and to determine whether there was a difference between patients with nephritis and those without nephritis. Twenty patients with HSP aged between 2.5 and 15 and 10 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The HSP group was divided into two groups, including patients with nephritis (n = 9) and those without nephritis (n = 11). In all groups, circulating EMPs were enumerated by flow cytometry, after staining platelet-free plasma with PE-conjugated anti-CD144. At the same time, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were incubated with the platelet-free plasma of patients with HSP and that of the control group. Then, circulating EMPs were counted in HUVEC supernatant incubated with the platelet-free plasma of patients and control groups, after staining the supernatant with PE-conjugated anti-CD146. Circulating EMPs were significantly higher in both the active and the remission period of the patient groups compared with the control subjects. In the patient group, there were no statistically significant differences in the level of circulating EMPs between patients with nephritis and those without nephritis. Both CD144 and 146+EMP in patients with HSP nephritis in the active period were substantially higher than in those remissions. CD144+EMP in the active period were substantially higher than in the remission period in patients without nephritis. We detected that circulating EMPs increased in patients with HSP in both active and remission periods. Although clinical and laboratory findings return to normal in the remission period, the increased circulating EMPs may show that the subclinical inflammatory process is continuous. We think that circulating EMPs could be used as a surrogate marker for subclinical inflammation in HSP."
CD010864,0,15692234,0,Controversial issues in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.,"Although considerable progress has been made in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism, several issues remain that are awaiting a proper solution. Among them are: the respective role of compression ultrasound of the proximal veins and ultrasonography of the entire leg vein system in the diagnostic approach of patients with the clinical suspicion of the first episode of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities; the safety of managing subgroups of patients with suspected DVT without objective tests, i.e., with the use of pre-test probability scores and D-dimer assays; the role of ultrasonography in the diagnostic approach of patients with suspected ipsilateral recurrent thrombosis; and the role of spiral CT in the diagnostic approach of patients with clinically symptomatic pulmonary embolism."
CD010864,0,10326764,0,Contrasting post-traumatic serial changes for D-dimer and PAI-1 in critically injured patients.,"We measured D-dimer and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity in 45 trauma patients to assess their efficacy in predicting the post-traumatic hemostatic perturbations. We found the correlation between D-dimer measured by Simpli Red test and ELISA to be highly significant (p=0.0001). The D-dimer ELISA indicated that the serial changes of D-dimer after trauma were variable. However, the increases of D-dimer were associated with clinical conditions of the patient, such as trauma surgery, infections, or thrombotic complications. A significant correlation was found for D-dimer levels measured by ELISA versus the injury severity score (ISS) in all the trauma patients on day 1 (p=0.0153) and on day 2 (p=0.0495). The PAI-1 activity was increased at admission and showed a progessive decline from day 2 onward, and the correlation for the daily decline of PAI-1 was highly significant (p=0.0001). The PAI-1 activity and plasminogen activator activity showed a significant negative correlation on days 1, 2, and 3. PAI-1 activity correlated moderately with D-dimer level only on day 1 (p=0.0569). Three out of forty-five patients developed thrombotic complications: one patient who died from pulmonary embolism and two patients who developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In summary: 1) PAI-1 activity and D-dimer exhibited contrasting serial changes after trauma. 2) There was also a negative correlation between PAI-1 activity and PA activity. 3) A significant correlation of D-dimer with ISS confirms, as might be anticipated, that there is increased activation of the coagulation mechanism in severe injury, and suggests that D-dimer levels may prove useful to screen for patients at strong risks of thrombotic complications."

CD010864,0,21854430,0,Hypereosinophilic syndrome presenting with large left ventricular apical thrombus and pulmonary embolism.,"A 45-year-old man presented with dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and cough. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large apical thrombus in the left ventricle. The laboratory results showed prominent eosinophilia on blood smear, elevated acute phase reactants and D-dimer serum levels. Bone marrow examination showed a Fip1-like platelet-derived growth factor receptor alfa fusion gene mutation. The case was diagnosed as myeloproliferative variant hypereosinophilic syndrome. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated thrombi not only in left ventricle but also in multiple segmental pulmonary arteries. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed left ventricular apical thrombus without subendocardial fibrosis. Cardiopulmonary manifestations of hypereosinophilic syndrome completely resolved after treatment."
CD010864,0,12032398,0,"Evaluation of a new automated quantitative d-dimer, Advanced D-Dimer, in patients suspected of venous thromboembolism.","The objective of our study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of a new automated d-dimer, the Advanced D-Dimer (Dade Behring Inc., Deerfield, IL) for use in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). To do this we compared the Advanced D-Dimer to existing d-dimer methods using established target cut-off values in patients suspected of VTE who were to undergo definitive radiographic studies for VTE. We studied hospitalized patients and outpatients who were suspected of having VTE and who had whole blood d-dimer performed. The patients who underwent a diagnostic study for VTE had their D-dimer results used to determine sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive values. There was relatively poor correlation between the Advanced D-Dimer and D-Dimer Gold (r = 0.63; t-test: P < 0.005) and Asserachrome D-Di (r = 0.58; t-test: P < 0.005). The Advanced D-Dimer target cutoff values for excluding VTE in hospitalized and outpatients were < or = 1800 microg/L and < or = 1500 microg/l respectively. There were 139 patients suspected with pulmonary embolism (PE) and 328 evaluated for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There were 24 patients with PE, and 43 with DVT. The Advanced D-Dimer had comparable sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive values (96, 43, 98% for PE and 96, 48, 99% for DVT respectively) to other d-dimer methods used for that purpose. We conclude that the Advanced D-Dimer correlates relatively poorly with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. This poor correlation is likely due to incorrect reporting units and concentration. When these factors are corrected correlations improved. Compared to existing d-dimer methods used for VTE exclusion, the high sensitivity and negative predictive value would suggest that this method can be used as part of a diagnostic algorithm for the exclusion of PE and DVT."

CD010864,0,12417857,0,[Pulmonary embolism and sibilant types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease decompensations].,"Pulmonary Embolism (PE) poses an important diagnostic problem in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Indeed PE may aggravate the already precarious respiratory state of these fragile patients. Moreover, these two conditions share common symptoms: dyspnoea, wheezing, pleural pain, haemoptysis, palpitations and signs of right cardiac insufficiency. In two studies, one retrospective and the other prospective, we investigated the incidence of PE in patients with non-infective exacerbations of their COPD. The retrospective study was carried out over two years and involved 50 COPD patients with non-infective respiratory exacerbations. In this population, 10 patients out of 50 (20%) had a documented PE. No predictive factor was identified. The prospective study was conducted over one year and COPD patients admitted to hospital with exacerbations were included in the study if they had a positive D-dimer blood test and no evidence of acute respiratory infection. 31 patients were studied with Doppler ultra-sound examination of the legs and a lung perfusion scan. The presence or absence of PE was determined and the two groups were compared. 9 patients out of 31 (29%) had a documented PE. Six of these nine patients had a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Two predictive factors of PE were identified: existence of a DVT and a significant fall in PaO(2) from baseline state (DeltaPaO(2) > 22 mmHg). We conclude that PE is a frequent (20 to 30%) of non-infective respiratory decompensation in COPD patients. Faced with an unexplained respiratory exacerbation in these patients, a lung perfusion scan should be routinely undertaken to rule out a PE when the D-dimers are positive."

CD010864,0,18203533,0,[Deep vein thrombosis in the psychiatric patients under physical restraint].,"Pulmonary thromboembolism induced by deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is known as economy-class syndrome, is one of sudden death in psychiatric patients under physical restraint. (1) A decrease in venous blood flow, (2) damage to vessel walls, and (3) the enhancement of blood clotting are the major risk factors for DVT (Virchow triad). It has been speculated that physical restraint inhibits venous blood flow, and that antipsychotic drugs facilitate blood clotting. In order to prevent sudden death due to DVT, prophylactic measures and early diagnosis are crucial. Whereas Doppler ultrasonography and contrast venography are the gold standards for the diagnosis of DVT, more simplified methods are now under development. Of those, D-dimer measurement, which can be conducted with a small blood sample, is the most potent candidate for the biochemical diagnosis of DVT. Although there are many prophylactic measures, including anticoagulant medications and physical therapies, it is not clear which is the most effective and suitable in psychiatric practice. Psychiatric professionals should pay closer attention to DVT in psychiatric patients under physical restraint."

CD010864,0,14653440,0,P-selectin and platelet-derived microparticles associated with monocyte activation markers in patients with pulmonary embolism.,"Platelet activation markers (platelet-derived microparticles and P-selectin on activated platelets), chemokines (monocyte chemotactic peptide and regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted), and soluble markers (sP-selectin, sE-selectin, sVCAM-1, and sCD14) were measured and compared in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). These substances are thought to participate in the pathogenesis of PE. Levels of all of the platelet activation markers, chemokines, and soluble markers were higher in the patients with PE than in normal controls. Levels of platelet activation markers were also significantly increased postoperatively after total knee arthroplasty. Anti-platelet therapy significantly inhibited the elevation of platelet activation markers after total knee arthroplasty. These findings suggest that antiplatelet therapy may be useful for PE-related interaction of platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells."
