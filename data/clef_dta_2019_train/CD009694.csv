CD009694,0,16179046,0,"Experiences of families when a relative is diagnosed brain stem dead: understanding of death, observation of brain stem death testing and attitudes to organ donation.","Brain stem death may be a difficult concept for relatives to understand. Our ITU practice follows published recommendations that the use of explanatory leaflets showing CT scans and observing brain stem death testing in some cases may help relatives to understand that death has occurred. Using this strategy, we interviewed 27 relatives 12 months after bereavement following certification by brain stem testing, investigating their understanding of brain stem death, subsequent attitudes to organ donation, grief reactions and attitudes of those who had observed the tests. Most relatives understood that the brain stem death tests indicated that survival was not possible, although three relatives had not fully understood this and valued the opportunity to discuss it again. Only five relatives observed the tests, all were pleased that they had done so as this had confirmed their understanding that death had occurred; however, these relatives had more evidence of psychological distress. No relatives who agreed to organ donation regretted this but three who did not allow donation subsequently expressed regret. Several relatives thought that observing the tests would have helped them to understand that death had occurred, making easier the decision to allow organ donation."
CD009694,0,19406767,1,CT angiography for brain death diagnosis.,"Lack of cerebral circulation is an important confirmatory test for brain death (BD). Conventional angiography remains the standard imaging method, but CT angiography (CTA) is emerging as an alternative. France accepts BD diagnoses relying on a score based on lack of opacification of 7 intracerebral vessels in CTA images. The purpose of this study was to validate the efficiency of this score and to evaluate the sensitivity of a novel 4-point CTA score in confirming BD."
CD009694,0,21971739,1,Computed tomography angiography (CTA) to prove circulatory arrest for the diagnosis of brain death in the context of organ transplantation.,"For the determination of brain death (BD) in potential organ donors, confirmatory tests that show cessation of cerebral circulation are used in many countries. Conventional angiography is considered the golden standard among these ancillary examinations. In recent years other angiographic techniques such as CT angiography (CTA) have been increasingly employed to establish the diagnosis of BD. We report our experience with CTA in this setting."
CD009694,0,8169618,0,Hemorrhagic dilation of the fourth ventricle: an ominous predictor.,"Very little is known about the effect of computerized tomography (CT)-documented fourth intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). An analysis of 50 patients with CT-documented fourth IVH treated between 1987 and 1992 is presented. The various etiologies included intraparenchymal hemorrhage with secondary fourth IVH (19 cases), spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (18 cases), spontaneous IVH (seven cases), and trauma (six cases). Overall, 28 patients (56%) had hemorrhagic dilation of the fourth ventricle and all 28 suffered brain death, despite aggressive therapy in 79% of cases. Twenty-two patients (44%) had fourth IVH without dilation; of these, nine (41%) died and 13 (59%) experienced functional survival, despite aggressive care in 90% of cases. The survival rate was significantly worse for patients with dilation of the fourth ventricle (p < 0.01, chi-squared test). Of the 28 patients with fourth IVH associated with dilation, 25 (89%) had diffuse clot, involving the lateral and third ventricles as well, and three (11%) had isolated fourth IVH. Of the 22 patients with fourth IVH and no dilation, 13 (59%) had diffuse IVH (eight of these died and five had functional recovery) and nine (41%) had isolated fourth IVH (one died and eight had functional recovery). Diffuse ventricular clot was associated with an increased mortality rate for patients with fourth IVH and no dilation (p < 0.05). Of the 28 patients with fourth IVH associated with dilation, 24 (86%) presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 or 4, one with a GCS score of 6, and three with a GCS score of 13 to 15; all 28 died. For the 22 patients with fourth IVH and no dilation, nine presented with a GCS score of 3 to 5 (eight died and one had functional recovery), three had a GCS score of 6 to 8 (all three had functional survival), two had a GCS score of 9 to 12 (both had functional survival), and eight had a GCS score of 13 to 15 (one died and seven had functional survival). There was a greater chance of higher GCS scores in patients with fourth IVH and no hemorrhagic dilation (p < 0.01). Logistic regression multivariate analysis showed hemorrhagic fourth ventricular dilation to be the most significant outcome predictor (p = 0.0001), followed by GCS score (p = 0.007) and the presence of diffuse IVH (p = 0.0279)."
CD009694,0,22327714,1,CT angiography as a confirmatory test in brain death.,"From recent studies, it remains unclear whether CT angiography could be an alternative to other established ancillary tests for the diagnosis of brain death. We examined intracranial contrast enhancement in CT angiography after clinically established brain death and compared the results with EEG and TCD findings."
CD009694,0,8561037,0,Head-injured adult patients with GCS of 3 on admission--who have a chance to survive?,"The authors analysed a series of 111 adult patients admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University of Lódź directly after trauma with initial GCS of 3 points. 74% of them had intracranial haematoma, mainly subdural, and were treated surgically within the first 3 hours after trauma. 8 patients had no abnormalities on CT scans. 99 (89%) patients died 2 to 30 days after injury, 8 (7%) survived in a vegetative state, and only in 4 (4%) was a satisfactory result noted, but 2 of them had a stable neurological deficit. 3 of these 4 patients had epidural haematomas and 1 had not abnormalities on repeated CT examinations. We conclude, that among patients with GCS of 3 on admission, only those without major CT abnormalities or with epidural haematoma have a chance of survival. Cases with cerebral lesions on the initial CT examination have an invariably bad prognosis. They could be taken into account as a potential organ donor from the very moment of admission, but only after cerebral circulatory arrest occurred and brain death has been proved according to internationally accepted standards."
CD009694,0,15621089,0,Identification by CT scan of ischemic stroke patients with high risk of brain death.,"The identification of patients with high risk of evolution to brain death is one of the more important tasks of transplant coordination teams. Although most of pool of potential donors come from the group of patients who suffer a head injury or hemorrhagic stroke, the procurement of organs from brain-dead patients suffering an ischemic stroke as the cause of brain damage must also be considered. The main objective of this study was to investigate the radiological signs that in the CT scan of admission to a neurological ICU are more frequently associated with progression to brain death. We studied the CT scans of 15 brain-dead patients after an ischemic stroke versus the scans of 15 recovered patients admitted to ICU with the same diagnosis. The radiological signs included: insular ribbon sign, hyperintensities inside the big arteries of the base of the skull, hemispheric hypodensities, midline shift, and compression of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces. There were two signs significantly associated with brain death: midline shifts and the compression of the ambiens cistern. It may be concluded that analysis of the CT scan at admission of patients with an ischemic stroke in the ICU can predict the risk of evolution to brain death."
CD009694,0,19682299,0,Absence of residual Hodgkin's disease demonstrated by PET/CT in a deceased organ donor.,"With the current limited availability of organs for transplantation, it is important to consider marginal donor candidates, including survivors of potentially curable malignancies such as lymphoma. The absence of refractory/recurrent residual disease at the time of brain death can be difficult to establish. Therefore, it is critical to have objective data to decide whether to proceed or not with organ procurement and transplantation. We report a unique situation in which (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) was used to rule out Hodgkin's lymphoma recurrence in a 33-year-old, heart-beating, brain-dead, potential donor with a past history of Hodgkin's disease and a persistent mediastinal mass. PET showed no significant uptake in the mass, allowing organ donation and transplantation to occur. We present a new means of evaluating potential brain-dead donors with a past history of some lymphoma, whereby PET may help transplant physicians by optimizing donation safety while rationalizing the inclusion of marginal donors."
CD009694,0,12049541,0,Prospective evaluation of the safety of enoxaparin prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in patients with intracranial hemorrhagic injuries.,Patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhagic injuries (IHIs) are at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The safety of early anticoagulation for IHI has not been established.
CD009694,0,15459624,0,Status epilepticus after a massive intravenous N-acetylcysteine overdose leading to intracranial hypertension and death.,"Cases of N-acetylcysteine overdose have been reported before. In some cases, these overdoses have led to death if an anaphylactoid reaction was present. A healthy 30-month-old girl allegedly ingested acetaminophen at 418 mg/kg. Because the emergency physician feared the time of ingestion might not be accurate, he decided to start the 20.5-hour intravenous N-acetylcysteine protocol 8 hours after ingestion. He mistakenly prescribed the maximum milliliter-per-kilogram volume of the dextrose 5% diluent for the milliliter-per-kilogram volume of N-acetylcysteine 20% to be administered. Five hours after the error was detected (19.5 hours postingestion), the patient started developing myoclonus on the left side of her body, with left eye deviation. This condition persisted intermittently for 3 hours despite treatment with diazepam, lorazepam, and phenytoin. A first computed tomographic scan result was normal. A few hours later, she sustained shorter recurrences of the myoclonus. At 30 hours after ingestion, she started to have irregular breathing and became unresponsive to pain. A repeated computed tomographic scan showed diffuse cerebral edema. A postmortem examination showed the presence of acute anoxic encephalopathy with marked cerebral edema and the beginning of uncal herniation that confirmed the clinical diagnosis of intracranial hypertension and brain death. A cumulative intravenous dose of 2,450 mg/kg of N -acetylcysteine was associated with status epilepticus, intracranial hypertension, and death in a child."
CD009694,0,17415206,0,Early hypodensity on computed tomographic scan of the brain in an accidental pediatric head injury.,"Hypodensities on computed tomographic (CT) brain scans are thought to take at least 6 hours to become apparent after blunt head trauma. This finding, in conjunction with the later evolution of the hypodensities, is used in timing the injury in children with suspected non-accidental brain injury, in whom the history may be inaccurate. The purpose of this study is to report the occurrence of diffuse cerebral parenchymal hypodensities on CT scans performed within 5 hours of a well-defined accidental head injury."
CD009694,0,16564244,0,Ex vivo evaluation of human lungs for transplant suitability.,"If lungs could be retrieved from non-heart-beating donors, the critical shortage of lungs for transplant could be alleviated. An obstacle to this approach is the inability to predict these lungs' suitability for transplant. We used human lungs deemed unsuitable for transplant to develop a method to perfuse and ventilate human lungs ex vivo to assess gas exchange and vascular resistance, and to perform bronchoscopic inspection and radiographic evaluation."
CD009694,0,7936259,0,Brain single-photon emission computed tomography.,"Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides cost-effective information on regional cerebral perfusion and, indirectly, on regional cerebral metabolism. Its ease of use facilitates the application of SPECT in clinical neurology. SPECT is emerging as a useful tool for the management of patients with stroke, epilepsy, recurrent brain neoplasms, and some forms of dementia. The applications being investigated, such as in vivo receptor labeling for benzodiazepines, serotonin, dopamine, and muscarinic receptors, may expand the clinical usefulness of this technique in the future."
CD009694,0,19263358,0,Gunshot injuries due to celebratory gun shootings.,Traditional shooting with guns often occurs and leads to unwanted gunshot injuries in areas where celebrations are held. Such injuries have been classified as celebratory gun shooting injury in the international disease classification system.
CD009694,0,8239201,0,Fatal cerebral gunshot wounds: factors influencing organ donation.,"Patients with clinical brain death following head injury are important potential cadaveric organ donors. We analyzed our series of cranial gunshot wounds with particular attention to the frequency and patterns of organ donation after fatal injuries. Sixty-six patients with gunshot wounds to the head, including 59 with intracranial involvement (43 male, average age 26 years) were seen during a 4-year period. Injuries were limited to the head in 50 of 59 patients. Overall mortality was 66 per cent. Predictors of mortality included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of six or less (93%), self-inflicted gunshot wounds (75%), and computed tomography (CT) findings of bihemispheric injury (87%) or ventricular injury (82%). Of the 39 patients who died, 28 met standard criteria for brain death, and nine of these went on to organ procurement. Thirteen families refused donation, and six patients were not harvested for reasons including old age, pregnancy, suspicion of AIDS, coroner refusal, and failure to pursue consent. Principles essential to maximal organ retrieval include: 1) Recognition that patients suffering cerebral gunshot wounds represent potential organ donors and that certain factors are predictive of mortality; 2) Critical care/trauma team approach with standardized management and timely declaration of brain death; 3) Early search for family members and prompt notification of organ procurement agencies; 4) Sensitivity to cultural issues influencing donation; and 5) Programs to increase public awareness of organ donation."
CD009694,0,19931796,0,Valproic acid intoxication imitating brain death.,"The declaration of brain death requires a standardized clinical neurologic examination and, importantly, the resolution of the underlying cause. Because sedative and anesthetic agents can closely mimic brain death, intoxications must be ruled out. Aspects of brain stem function, particularly the pupillary responses to light, remain intact in most cases of poisonings. Intoxications that cause a condition that fully mimics brain death have only been described in cases of intoxications with tricyclic antidepressants and barbiturates so far. We report the case of a 19-year-old man who presented with severe confusion and developed a deep coma over the next hours. Clinical examination revealed absence of all brain stem reflexes including missing pupillary responses to light. Blood analysis revealed a valproic acid intoxication with levels of 12,430 micromol/L (normal, 350-700 micromol/L) with concomitant severe hyperammonemia of 500 micromol/L (normal, <30 micromol/L), and treatment was initiated including the administration of L-carnitine and a continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Brain edema as the cause of absent brain stem reflexes was ruled out twice by computed tomography. After normalization of the serum levels, the patient had a full clinical recovery."
CD009694,0,12148230,0,[Reconstructive surgery using composite tissue allografts: perspectives from the first clinical cases].,"Tissue allotransplantation is defined by the transfer of tissues harvested from a cadaveric donor (in a brain dead condition) and revascularized to a recipient subject. This is based on the mastery of microsurgical techniques and on the induction of a therapeutic immunosuppression for the recipient. The first allografts (flexor tendon systems, knees and femoral diaphysis, hands, nerves, larynx) opened the field of composite tissue allotransplantation (C.T.A.) in reconstructive surgery. Immunosuppressive agents are now efficient enough to prevent the rejection of the allografts. The first patients operated on did not suffer from major or irreversible complications, but some potential side-effects of the immunosuppression remain an obstacle to the development of allografts in reconstructive surgery. The early functional results of the allografts are encouraging but their long term evolution remains uncertain. Some immunological (the chronic rejection) or psychological (the refusal of the graft and of its constraints) phenomenon might curtail the functional, aesthetic and psychological result. Currently considered as an extreme solution to exceptional indications, C.T.A. represents a tremendous hope for the future of reconstructive surgery."

CD009694,0,17175372,0,Transorbital sonographic monitoring of optic nerve diameter in patients with severe brain injury.,We investigated whether alterations in the optic nerve diameter (OND) correlated with brain computed tomography (CT) imaging results among patients with brain injury and whether monitoring of OND could predict brain death.
CD009694,0,8757010,0,The value of intracranial pressure monitoring in acute hemispheric stroke.,"Persistently elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) has been associated with poor clinical outcome after severe brain injury, such as neurotrauma, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoidal hemorrhage. Although ICP monitoring is increasingly being used in intensive care treatment of patients with ischemic stroke, its value has not been established."
CD009694,0,17066356,0,[Prevention of organ failure in an organ donor. Early identification and maximum protective therapy after multiple trauma].,A 18-year-old woman suffered from severe multi-trauma in combination with acute brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale Score = 4) after road accident. After prolonged rescue measures and emergency stabilisation the patient was transferred by helicopter to the emergency department of our clinic.
CD009694,0,8306731,0,Diagnosis of traumatic mediastinal hematoma with transesophageal echocardiography.,"In patients with blunt chest trauma, early diagnosis of mediastinal hematoma is important, because it could be associated with thoracic vessel injury. Mediastinal hematoma is generally evoked because of a widened mediastinum on chest radiograph, but radiologic diagnosis may lead to excessive angiography being performed. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) provides accurate views of the mediastinum and can be rapidly performed at the bedside. Thus, we conducted a prospective study to define TEE signs of mediastinal hematoma. TEE was performed in 22 thoracic trauma patients (trauma group) and in 20 brain-dead patients without thoracic trauma (control group). The positive diagnosis of mediastinal hematoma was made using thoracic surgery or computed tomographic scan. The specificity of TEE was 75 percent and sensitivity was 100 percent. In the trauma group, there was only one false positive but angiography discovered a traumatic aneurysm of the proximal right subclavian artery. No false negative was noted. We described three different TEE signs of mediastinal hematoma: (1) an increased distance between the probe and the aortic wall; (2) a double contour of the aortic wall; and (3) visualization of the ultrasound signal between the aortic wall and the visceral pleura. The distance between the esophageal probe and the aortic wall was the most accurate sign because it could be easily obtained; the threshold value for this distance was 3 mm. TEE appears to be an accurate method to diagnose traumatic mediastinal hematoma."
CD009694,0,8128257,0,[Epidural hematoma with atypical clinical course].,"The prognosis of epidural haematomas (EDH) is generally favourable if an operation is carried out in good time. Suspected EDH is mostly diagnosed as a result of a ""typical"" neurological manifestation (initial unconsciousness/asymptomatic interval/loss of consciousness), which then leads to an in-depth diagnosis (X-ray of the skull, CT, MRI). However, atypical clinical manifestations are frequent and can result in dangerous delays in diagnosis and treatment. A decisive factor in the early detection of EDH is close clinical-neurological monitoring by specially trained staff and their prompt reaction when changes occur, no matter how minor. Qualitative changes in the patient's state of consciousness and behaviour are just as important in this respect as quantitative ones."
CD009694,0,9484351,0,Large infarcts in the middle cerebral artery territory. Etiology and outcome patterns.,"Large supratentorial infarctions play an important role in early mortality and severe disability from stroke. However, data concerning these types of infarction are scarce. Using data from the Lausanne Stroke Registry, we studied patients with a CT-proven infarction of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory that covered at least two of three MCA subterritories (deep, superficial anterior [superior] and posterior [inferior] territory). We compared these patients with patients presenting more limited infarction in the MCA territory. Our study group of large MCA (laMCA) infarction contained 208 patients, corresponding to 7.6% of all ischemic infarctions in the Lausanne Stroke Registry. Seventy-two patients had complete infarction in the whole MCA territory (coMCA). Internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion (41%) and ICA dissection (12%) were more common than in limited superficial MCA (lsMCA) infarct and anterior circulation infarct (p < 0.001). Among the patients without ICA occlusion, atrial fibrillation (33%; p < 0.002) and cardiogenic embolism in general (54%; p < 0.001) were more frequent in laMCA than in lsMCA infarct. Severe neurologic deficit (hemiplegia and hemisensory loss in the face, arm and leg, hemianopia, global aphasia, reduced consciousness) was more common than in other types of infarct. A combination of these symptoms had a positive predictive value for laMCA infarction of 0.73 (sensitivity for left side laMCA infarcts, 0.56). Mortality (17%) and severe disability (50%) were higher with laMCA than for other infarcts (p < 0.001). Sixteen of the 35 deaths could be attributed to brain edema. Reduced consciousness, hemianopia, and coMCA infarction were independent predictors of death or severe disability; for death only, coma was an independent predictor. Patients who died because of brain edema were younger than patients whose death was due to other causes (mean age, 57 versus 73 years; p < 0.001); they also died sooner (mean time of death after stroke, 5 versus 37 days; p < 0.001). Furthermore, patients who developed coma on the day of admission were more likely to die because of brain death (p < 0.001). Large middle cerebral artery infarction is associated with cardiogenic embolism, ICA occlusion, and ICA dissection. It is a major predictor of death and severe disability, although a lower frequency of malignant brain infarction was found than previously reported."
CD009694,0,17666719,0,[The electroencephalogram is not an adequate test to confirm the diagnosis of brain death].,"In France, legislation mandates that the clinical diagnosis of brain death be confirmed by one paraclinical test before organ donation is allowed. That test may be either the electroencephalogram (EEG) or cerebral angiography. We report a case in which the clinical diagnosis of brain death was first confirmed by two EEGs performed according to the French guidelines, but ruled out by cerebral angiography. Considering that the EEG is no longer recommended to establish the diagnosis of brain death, we discuss the relevance of maintaining the EEG for brain death diagnosis in France."

CD009694,0,11761916,0,[Acute edematous encephalopathy presenting with refractory generalized status epilepticus: an autopsy case].,"A previously healthy, 29-year-old man developed generalized convulsion with disturbed consciousness 3 days after the flu-like symptoms. On the next day, his convulsion evolved into generalized status epilepticus (GSE) that was unresponsive to administration of various anticonvulsants. Then, intravenous anesthetic agents, including midazolam, propofol and vecuronium sodium, were continuously infused. During the following 9 days, despite of high-dose infusion of these anesthetic agents, his GSE could not be suppressed, and complex partial seizure with secondary generalization frequently occurred. The patient was comatose and mechanically ventilated, whereas the brainstem reflexes were preserved. Electroencephalogram revealed a diffuse slowing of the background activity and occasional focal spike and wave complexes with secondary generalization. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed pleocytosis and elevated protein concentration. Cranial CT scans obtained on day 8 demonstrated brain edema. On day 10, his GSE ceased with abolition of the brainstem reflexes, and he lapsed into brain death resulting from the progressive brain edema. Over the following six days, his systemic circulation gradually worsened, and he died on day 16. On postmortem examination, the brain was markedly edematous and showed the findings consistent with acute anoxic encephalopathy with extensive circulatory stasis. Mild gliosis was observed in the insular cortex, yet no evidence of inflammatory disease was found throughout the brain. This patient was characterized by acutely progressive severe brain edema without inflammatory changes, suggesting that his primary disease was acute toxic encephalopathy presumably induced by viral infection. His GSE was refractory and unresponsive to the intensive treatment with the intravenous anesthetic agents. This case epitomizes the difficulties in controlling refractory seizures in some patients with encephalopathy or encephalitis."
CD009694,0,16719407,0,Fatal Epstein-Barr virus meningitis: an autopsy report.,"A 3-year-old Asian female presented with fever for 1 week and neck swelling for 1 day. Serology revealed a recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Late on the evening of admission, she developed confusion and would not follow commands. A CT scan showed diffuse cerebral edema and a cerebral flow scan demonstrated no blood flow to the brain. She was declared brain dead and expired on the following day. At autopsy, the brain weighted 1175 grams and grossly showed significant edema. Microscopically, the entire neuraxis revealed extensive leptomeningeal infiltrate of mainly CD8+ T lymphocytes, the majority of which expressed activated markers, HLA-DR and/or CD45RO, and monocytes/macrophages with intermixed numerous apoptotic/karyorrhectic nuclear fragments. These nuclear fragments were considered to be due to apoptosis of the expanded population of CD8+ T lymphocytes. Focal venulitis was noted. EBV-encoded small nuclear RNA in situ hybridization revealed positivity in the occasional lymphocytes. Interestingly, most intraparenchymal as well as leptomeningeal vascular endothelium showed HLA-DR immunoreactivity. This finding has been reported primarily in the acute inflammatory/demyelinating conditions, not in the viral meningitis/meningoencephalitis, and was thought to be related to cytokines due to widespread inflammation in our case. Massive edema secondary to severe EBV-meningitis can be fatal."

CD009694,0,21795016,0,Diffuse ischemia in noncontrast computed tomography predicts outcome in patients in intensive care unit.,"In the intensive care unit (ICU), prognosticating patients who are comatose or defining brain death can be challenging. Currently, the criteria for brain death are clinical supported by paraclinical tests. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) shows diffuse loss of grey-white differentiation consistent with infarction. We hypothesize that the extent of hypodensity is predictive of poor neurologic outcome or brain death."
CD009694,0,19427446,0,Effect of adenosine monophosphate deaminase-1 C34T allele on the requirement for donor inotropic support and on the incidence of early graft dysfunction after cardiac transplantation.,"The C34T T allele of the adenosine monophosphate deaminase-1 (AMPD1) gene has been associated with improved outcome in patients with cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesized that possession of this allele by donor hearts plays a role in the outcome of cardiac transplantation; 262 cardiac donors and 190 of their recipients were studied. AMPD1 C34T genotype was determined using 5' exonuclease chemistry. Requirement for inotropic agents before organ donation, 1-year post-transplantation survival, cause of death, and factors known to affect survival after transplantation were also studied. Multiple regression models for factors affecting survival were constructed. A significant yearly increase in frequency of the T allele in donors was noted (0.06 to 0.18 from 1994 to 1999). Donors with the CT or TT genotype required less inotropic support than those with the CC genotype (mean number of inotropes per donor with CT or TT genotype 0.27 compared with 0.47 per donor with CC genotype, n = 206, p = 0.03). Recipients of T-allele-carrying organs showed worse 1-year survival after transplantation (59% vs 79%, p <0.001). Excess deaths in these patients was due to early graft dysfunction (odds ratio for early graft dysfunction 6.6, 95% confidence interval 2 to 21.6, p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed donor AMPD1 genotype, recipient age, and pretransplantation anemia to independently affect 1-year post-transplantation survival (adjusted hazard ratios 3.7, 1.06, and 2.6, respectively). In conclusion, possession of the AMPD1 T allele is associated with decreased inotropic requirements before heart donation. The incidence of early graft dysfunction, however, was significantly higher in recipients who received AMPD1 T-allele-possessing organs resulting in worse 1-year survival."

CD009694,0,11029881,0,A 35-year-old man with cerebral hemorrhage and pheochromocytoma: the second brain-dead organ donor in Japan.,"A 35-year-old man was brought into the emergency room of Keio University Hospital by ambulance because of a sudden onset of coma. His Glasgow Coma Scale was 3 and his blood pressure 150/100 mmHg. CT scanning revealed a subcortical hemorrhage 8 cm in diameter. His respiration deteriorated rapidly, and an emergency craniotomy was performed for hematoma removal and cerebral decompression. Postoperatively the patient remained in a deep coma (GCS = 3) requiring respiratory support. The family presented an organ donor card previously signed by the patient, and brain death was confirmed in accordance with Japan's transplant law. As a result of two tests conducted six hours apart brain death was confirmed on the 5th postoperative day. With the family's consent, the donor's heart, kidneys and skin were removed for organ transplantation to be performed in other institutions. An autopsy was performed after the removal of the organs and skin. An extensive subgaleal hemorrhage was found in the left cerebral hemisphere, and microscopic examination revealed extensive necrosis with karyolysis of neuronal cells, but no viable neuronal cells were found in the cerebrum. The brain stem was marked by edema, hemorrhage, infarction necrosis and neuronal cell loss. The cerebellum was swollen and congested and showed autolysis of the granular layer. These findings suggested brain death syndrome with respirator brain. Other autopsy findings included a huge pheochromocytoma in the right adrenal gland, bilateral bronchopneumonia, liver congestion and fatty metamorphosis with four cavernous hemangiomas, and mild chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. This patient was the second brain-dead organ donor and the first brain-dead patient to undergo postmortem examination in Japan."
CD009694,0,12357087,0,Interhemispheric intracranial pressure gradients in massive cerebral infarction.,"We report continuous bilateral intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring immediately after transtentorial herniation in a patient with massive cerebral infarction to: 1) determine presence and time course of compartmental ICP differences, and 2) to study effects of therapy on both hemispheres. A 55-year-old man admitted with watershed infarctions in the left anterior-middle-posterior cerebral arteries distribution. Initial investigations demonstrated highly narrowed left extracranial internal carotid artery. Eight days later he developed unexplained lethargy and anisocoria. Head computerized tomography (CT) showed massive left hemispheric infarction, edema, and midline shift. Bilateral subarachnoid bolts demonstrated equally elevated ICP in both hemispheres. Hyperventilation and osmotic therapy produced near-identical ICP reduction bilaterally with resolution of anisocoria. Later, plateau waves and autonomic instability developed. Shortly before loss of brainstem function, interhemispheric ICP gradients (left greater than right) of 30-40 mm Hg developed. Intracranial pressure did not equalize prior to brain death determination. Bilateral ICP monitoring did not reveal an interhemispheric ICP gradient soon after transtentorial herniation in massive MCA infarction. The presence of interhemispheric ICP gradients in massive stroke remains unproven and further clinical study is necessary."

Recurrence of the tumor 8 months later was treated with 6,618 joules and patency of the left main bronchus was restored. Four months later, he developed complete atelectasis of the left lung requiring repeat laser. During the procedure he became hypotensive, bradycardic, and hypoxic due to a tension pneumothorax. Although treated promptly with thoracostomy tube drainage, the patient never awakened. CT scan of the brain demonstrated anoxic encephalopathy with air present in the right frontal lobe. Brain death was confirmed by an EEG and cerebral angiogram. Air embolism has been reported in conjunction with diagnostic procedures including therapeutic pneumothorax for tuberculosis, transthoracic needle biopsy of the lung, and positive pressure ventilation with or without pneumothorax. The only reported case of air embolism associated with laser was a small middle cerebral artery cerebro-vascular accident which was self limited. Its mechanism is unclear, but it is suspected to be due to a communication between a pulmonary vein and the atmosphere. A greater volume of air will enter the damaged vessel in the setting of positive pressure ventilation and/or a tension pneumothorax. When neurologic manifestations are present, hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the treatment of choice. Prompt institution in hemodynamically stable patients can minimize neurologic sequelae."
CD009694,0,21457328,0,Cardiac allograft vasculopathy: current knowledge and future direction.,"Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a unique form of coronary artery disease affecting heart transplant recipients. Although prognosis of heart transplant recipients has improved over time, CAV remains a significant cause of mortality beyond the first year of cardiac transplantation. Many traditional and non-traditional risk factors for the development of CAV have been described. Traditional risk factors include dyslipidemia, diabetes and hypertension. Non-traditional risk factors include cytomegalovirus infection, HLA mismatch, antibody-mediated rejection, and mode of donor brain death. There is a complex interplay between immunological and non-immunological factors ultimately leading to endothelial injury and exaggerated repair response. Pathologically, CAV manifests as fibroelastic proliferation of intima and luminal stenosis. Early diagnosis is paramount as heart transplant recipients are frequently asymptomatic owing to cardiac denervation related to the transplant surgery. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) offers many advantages over conventional angiography and is an excellent predictor of prognosis in heart transplant recipients. Many non-invasive diagnostic tests including dobutamine stress echocardiography, CT angiography, and MRI are available; though, none has replaced angiography. This review discusses the risk factors, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of CAV and highlights some current concepts and recent developments in this field."

The patient was a 32-yr-old male with advanced end-stage liver disease manifested by tense ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, deepening jaundice and anuria requiring hemodialysis. The 3rd day after successful liver transplantation the patient developed acute respiratory failure, then focal motor signs. Computed tomography showed fluid in the left maxillary sinus, partial opacification of the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and diffuse low density lesions in both cerebral hemispheres. Despite treatment for cerebritis and cerebral edema, the patient's pupils became fixed and dilated, and brain death was declared. Autopsy revealed mucor sinusitis and cerebritis. Mucormycosis is an opportunistic fungal infection occurring in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, malignancy, or immunodeficiency, and in those receiving wide-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, or cytotoxic therapy. Mucor most frequently involves the face, rhinocerebral disease predominating. These infections are difficult to treat, but are curable with aggressive and frequent surgical debridement, discontinuation or reduction of immunosuppressive therapy and amphotericin. The diagnosis of mucormycosis is very difficult to make in cases such as the present one, in which the typical presentation and classical signs are not present. A high index of suspicion based on identified risk factors may assist in more rapid diagnosis of this life-threatening mycosis."

Five hours after the operation, brain death due to a cerebral herniation occurred, and he died six days later. Autopsy revealed a linear fracture of the parietal bones, which crossed obliquely the sagittal sutura. A slightly lacerated wound of the dura mater was seen on the sagittal sutura, from where the latter half of that point to the left and right transverse sinuses were occluded completely with thrombosis. The brain was markedly swollen. From these findings, the victim was considered to have died from acute cerebral swelling due to traumatic thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus."

CD009694,0,19765476,0,Fat and bone marrow embolization in a donor as the cause of death in a lung recipient.,"The cause of death in organ donors may have a great impact on organ recipient outcomes. Trauma is the prevailing cause of death among brain-dead patients in Iran and many other countries. Such patients may have many complications, among them vascular embolization with fat and other tissues. We have described herein a case of vascular embolization in a donor and its consequence on the recipient's outcome. The recipient was a 36-year-old woman with pulmonary fibrosis, who received a single lung transplant from a patient brain dead due to trauma. Donor had no obvious fractures; the oxygen challenge test was ideal. The harvested lung was normal upon bronchoscopy and it was clear on plain chest radiography. The day after lung transplantation, the recipient was extubated successfully with normal O(2) saturation. On computed tomography scan, there was a fixed infiltration at the base of the transplanted lung. On day 5 posttransplantation, the infiltrate expanded and the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly and she expired on day 10 posttransplantation due to ARDS. The pathologic examination of the brain-dead patient, which was obtained from another patient's lung, was available after our recipient's death, showed massive vascular fat and bone marrow embolization. In the mentioned case, all criteria for lung harvest from the brain-dead patient were met. Looking for embolization is not among the criteria for lung transplantation if chest radiography is clear and O(2) challenge test is acceptable, but we observed a poor recipient outcome due to bone and fat embolization in the donor's lung. When transplanting from a traumatic patients, such complications should be kept in mind."
CD009694,0,8341242,0,[The surgical management of blunt liver trauma].,"One hundred and sixty-six consecutive patients with closed hepatic injury admitted to Osaka University Hospital from 1966 to 1990 were reviewed to evaluate the surgical procedures for injured liver. Of the 166 patients, 37 died within 24 hours of initial management. Thirteen (35%) of the 37 died related to exsanguinating hemorrhage of liver injury. Emergency laparotomy required hepatic resection in all and revealed hepatic vein or retrohepatic caval injuries in 9. Eighty-nine of 129 patients who survived over 24 hours of initial management underwent emergency laparotomy. Twenty-two of the 129 died thereafter. Five (3 underwent lobectomy and 2 simple suture) died of liver injury-related complications. Perihepatic packing was performed in 5 and all except for 2 of brain death were alive. Most complications except for hemobilia were well resolved. CT scan study revealed profoundly radiating injuries closed to spine in 63% and suggested existence of hepatic vein or caval injury. Especially, 20 of 31 CT studies (65%) in conservative management of liver injury showed the same findings with intact capsule. These results support that exsanguinating hemorrhage from deep injury including hepatic vein or vena cava is the most lethal but can be controlled with liver packing in a similar mechanism to liver trauma in conservative management."
CD009694,0,1836720,0,Perioperative spinal canal narrowing in patients with Down's syndrome.,"Two patients with Down's syndrome undergoing intracardiac operations had segmental and generalized myoclonic movements postoperatively and eventual brain death. Electroencephalography in 1 patient showed no seizure despite the presence of the myoclonic movements. Computed tomographic scan showed possible cerebellar hemorrhage. Ultrasound showed cerebral edema when the pupils became fixed and dilated. Because known postoperative neurologic complications could not fully explain the clinical course, and the myoclonic movements suggested spinal origin, we considered the possibility of atlantoaxial instability causing spinal cord damage related to perioperative head and neck positioning. Postmortem study on the second patient revealed 50% reduction of the spinal canal with hyperextension and 90-degree external rotation of the head and neck. In contrast, similar maneuvers in 3 infants without Down's syndrome resulted in only mild spinal canal narrowing. Although the myoclonic movements could be explained by spinal cord compression at the atlantoaxial level, the explanation for the eventual brain death is unclear. However, kinking of the vertebral arteries related to the positioning could have caused cerebellar ischemia, hemorrhage, and increased intracranial pressure. We believe that attention to the problem might bring further answers in the future."

CD009694,0,8074104,0,Traumatic tear of tela choroidea resulting in fatal intraventricular hemorrhage.,"A 39-year-old man was rendered comatose after being struck repeatedly on the head in an altercation. After admission to the hospital, he had computed tomographic scan evidence of diffuse intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as cerebral edema. He shortly thereafter became ""brain dead"" and life-support systems were discontinued the following day. At autopsy, he had a swollen brain as well as evidence of intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage. No aneurysm or other grossly obvious cause for the hemorrhage was detected. There was, however, a small laceration of the lateral wall of the right lateral ventricle in the region of the caudate nucleus and thalamus, the choroid plexus was detached bilaterally, and the fornices were separated from the corpus callosum. Microscopically, there was further evidence of disruption of the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles, with fragments of ependymal lining mixed in with choroid plexus as well as blood between the fronds of the choroid plexus, and blood dissecting along the wall of the lateral ventricle deep to the ependyma. These findings were felt to be consistent with the recently proposed thesis that tears of the tela choroidea, as part of a so-called inner cerebral trauma, might produce intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage, which, in this case, proved to be fatal."
CD009694,0,1416275,0,[Monitoring of intracranial pressure with intraparenchymal fiberoptic transducer. Technical aspects and clinical reliability].,"A fiberoptic intracranial pressure transducer (Camino) was assessed prospectively in 100 patients. In all, 122 sensors were inserted intraparenchymally at the bedside, without the help of a neurosurgeon. Before the procedure, patients were given 2 to 4 mg of phenoperidine. The scalp was opened over a few millimeters in the frontal paramedian area. A burr holc was made with a 2 mm bit. The dura mater was opened and a hollow screw inserted in the diploë. When the zero of the transducer had been obtained, a 5 cm length was inserted within the screw. The transducer was then about 5 mm deep within cerebral parenchyma. The procedure took an average of about 15 min. An intracerebral haematoma around the transducer occurred five times. One had to be drained surgically. There were no infectious complications. The daily baseline drift was about 0.3 mmHg. The system seemed to be reliable: there was close agreement between the intracranial pressure (ICP), neurological status and CT scan findings. In trauma cases, there was also good correlation between mean ICP and the basal cistern obliteration score, finally, ICP became equivalent to mean arterial blood pressure in all brain dead patients. It is concluded that this system may be used in all cases where ICP requires to be monitored, even when the lateral ventricles are no longer visible, or when craniotomy has been performed. This will most probably result in a more extended use of ICP monitoring in neurosurgical intensive care."
CD009694,0,9191775,0,Barbiturate coma in severe hemispheric stroke: useful or obsolete?,"Barbiturates are administered in a variety of clinical conditions to control elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). However, their routine use to treat elevated ICP has been questioned because it may cause severe side effects. We therefore investigated the effect of high-dose barbiturate therapy on ICP and outcome in patients with severe brain edema after severe middle cerebral artery (MCA) or hemispheric infarction. Barbiturate coma was induced with thiopental infusion in 60 patients with critically increased ICP due to large hemispheric or MCA territory infarction, defined by CT. ICP was monitored in all patients during barbiturate therapy. Barbiturate coma was induced after a standardized treatment protocol for increased ICP after failure of osmotherapy and mild hyperventilation. During barbiturate administration, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and mean arterial pressure were recorded. Clinical outcome of these patients and the individual effect on ICP were analyzed. Only five of 60 patients who were treated with barbiturate coma survived (8%). All other patients died after transtentorial herniation with subsequent brain death. Barbiturate infusion was followed by a drop in ICP in 50 patients and showed no effect on ICP values in 10 patients. CPP decreased with a mean of 9 mm Hg (range, 5 to 20 mm Hg). Although barbiturates were initially effective, only in some patients was ICP control sustained. Severe side effects of barbiturate therapy, besides arterial hypotension, were seen in 15 patients (25%). Barbiturate coma in the therapy of increased ICP after severe ischemic hemispheric stroke can lower critically elevated ICP levels. However, it seems to have no positive effect on neurologic outcome."

The superiority of LDtx include better graft survival, independent of the donor/recipient relationship, less need for dialytic treatment with preemptive transplants and reduced immunogenicity of the graft due to the brain death-related ""cytokine storm."" Moreover, some emerging procedures namely laparoscopic nephrectomy instead of open surgery and spiral CT instead of renal angiography namely, reduce the physical and socioeconomic burden of the donor. In the light of these considerations, LDtx should be reconsidered in the Italian scenario of kidney transplantation."

The only exclusion criteria were brain death on admission, and severe hypotension due to extracranial injuries. All CTs were reviewed by one of us and the ""worst"" CT examination was determined. We defined the worst CT examination as that showing the most extensive degree of parenchymal-associated damage. Intracranial pressure was monitored in 25 severely head injured patients. Seventy-four patients (66%) showed an evolution from the initial CT scan (worst CT not corresponding to the admission CT). The outcome was favorable in 53 cases (73%) of patients with evolving lesions and in 32 cases (89%) with non evolving lesion. In the 25 severely head injured patients, Intra-cranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring (in combination with scheduled repeat CT scan) was helpful to identify the timing of the worst parenchymal damage and of surgery in those patients with an initial normal intracranial pressure in spite of an evolving lesion."

Brain death is present when all functions of the brain stem have irreversibly ceased. Clinical and electrophysiological criteria may be misinterpreted due to drug intoxication, hypothermia or technical artefacts. Thus, if clinical assessment is suboptimal, reliable early confirmatory tests may be required for demonstrating absence of intracranial blood flow. We have easily carried out and interpreted 99mTc HM-PAO SPECT in a consecutive series of 40 comatose patients with brain damage, without discontinuing therapy. Brain death was diagnosed in 7 patients, by recognising absence of brain perfusion, as shown by no intracranial radionuclide uptake.

However, sensitivity and specificity of these markers remain unknown. We retrospectively analyzed records of a series of 43 comatose patients at risk for cerebral ischemia, mainly after head injuries or subarachnoidal hemorrhage. Their SjvO2, jugulo-arterial lactate difference (VADLactate), and lactate-oxygen index (LOI) were determined every 8 hours. An increase in VADLactate and LOI was found, indicative of ischemia on CT scan, with threshold values of 0.30 mmol/L and 0.15, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 64%, respectively, for the VADLactate threshold, and 90% and 55%, respectively, for the LOI threshold. Regarding prediction of a poor outcome, only an increase in VADLactate had a predictive value with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 67%. No threshold value with sufficient sensitivity and specificity was found for SjvO2, as indicator of either ischemia or outcome. During progression to brain death, VADLactate and LOI reached abnormal levels earlier than cerebral perfusion pressure or SjvO2. They reacted markedly to focal ischemia due to vasospasm. Hyperlactacidemia rendered VADLactate and LOI uninterpretable by causing a brain lactate influx.

CD009694,0,9725517,0,Experience with cryopreserved arterial allografts in the treatment of prosthetic graft infections.,"The authors present a retrospective study on 30 patients with prosthetic graft infection. Included are 25 patients with aortic graft infection, three with infection of a femorodistal bypass and two with infected axillofemoral grafts. There were 23 isolated primary prosthetic graft infections and seven aorto-enteric fistulas. Treatment consisted of graft excision and replacement with cryopreserved arterial homografts, harvested from brain-death multi-organ donors. The in situ technique was used in 27 cases. Eight patients died postoperatively and two deaths were from allograft related complications. The operative mortality rate was 11% for isolated aortic graft sepsis and the early limb salvage rate was 100%. Persistent or recurrent infection was noted in two cases. The mean follow-up of the series was 24.5 months and occlusive complications occurred in five patients (23%), which resulted in two major amputations. Serial CT scans showed abnormalities in six of the 22 survivors, all of them related to the aortic segment of the allograft. It is concluded that in situ reconstruction with cryopreserved arterial allografts represents an acceptable alternative, especially in the treatment of isolated aortic graft sepsis. Continued follow-up towards late deterioration and/or occlusive complications remains mandatory."

A 64-year-old woman presented with severe back pain and syncope with a sudden left hemiplegia. CT scan demonstrated an aortic dissection of the entire aorta, obstruction of the right common carotid artery by extended aortic dissection, cerebral infarction of the right middle cerebral artery territory, brain edema and pericardial effusion. Though she was unable to communicate with us, she underwent an emergent aortic arch replacement and ligature of the right common carotid artery nine hours after the onset of stroke, when massive cerebral infarction was established. She survived the operation and regained full consciousness. When brain infarction was established by extended aortic dissection in emergent aortic surgery, concomitant ligature of the responsible artery to the brain infarction may be allowed for avoiding cerebral damage leading to brain death."

Retinal hemorrhage is commonly observed clinically in the optic fundi of patients with SAH, however, subhyaloid hemorrhage of the globe in the setting of SAH has been rarely on CT of the brain. Several mechanisms of subhyaloid hemorrhage have been proposed: a. A sudden increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) forces blood from the subarachnoid space directly into the preretinal space. b. A sudden rise in ICP is thought to decrease venous return to the cavernous sinus from the veins draining the globe. The increased retinal venous pressure results in stasis followed by vessel rupture. c. A sudden rise in ICP obstructs both the retinochoroidal anastomoses and the central retinal vein due to a rapid effusion of CSF through the communication of the subarachnoid space with the optic nerve sheat. This produces an acute decrease in venous drainage from the retina and results in stasis and hemorrhage."

In clinical practice, isoelectric electroencephalogram in not-brain-dead patients is rarely seen. We report on a 53-year-old patient who suffered ischaemic encephalopathy after cardiopulmonary arrest. He had residual brainstem function with sufficient spontaneous breathing and evidence of cerebral blood flow on single photon emission computed tomography scan, but his electroencephalogram was isoelectric. He survived this condition for more than 7 weeks. This case demonstrates that isoelectric electroencephalogram can not be equated with brain death, and that in prognostic assessment both clinical findings and supportive technical methods are mandatory."

CD009694,0,22117810,0,Scintigraphic confirmation of brain death.,"The concept of brain death has gained importance in the past few decades to prevent futile attempts to sustain ventilation and blood circulation when the brain has lost all function and to procure beneficial tissues or life-saving organs for transplantation. However, differences remain among professional societies and various study group recommendations, as well as among individual legal statutes, in how brain death is defined and the methodology for which the diagnosis is attained. Furthermore, reports have appeared both in the medical literature and the lay press concerning quality assurance measures in brain death documentation. Scintigraphy is a commonly used technique in the evaluation of brain death and can be performed with the use of either nonspecific tracers, such as Tc99m diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid, or brain-specific tracers, such as Tc99m hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (HMPAO). Planar imaging, with or without radionuclide angiography, continues to be the mainstay for the scintigraphic confirmation of brain death. Flow with multiprojection static planar imaging with the use of Tc99m HMPAO can be used to evaluate the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can provide cross-sectional information but can be difficult to perform in the context of brain death. The current use of SPECT primarily is supplemental to help differentiate overlying scalp from intracerebral activity. The reliability of SPECT to exclude flow and metabolism in the brainstem remains to be scientifically validated."

CD009694,0,17903676,0,Some questions about brain death: a case report.,"A 13-year-old girl had an anaphylactic cardiac arrest with 45 minutes of resuscitation. After rewarming on day 3, a first examination was compatible with brain death, including an apnea test. Shortly thereafter, a stimulus to the trapezius muscle above the clavicles resulted in bilateral lower-limb withdrawal. A subsequent examination by another intensivist found, during vestibulo-ocular testing, bilateral lower-limb withdrawal. A radionuclide cerebral blood-flow test indicated no intracranial flow, and a computed tomography scan indicated diffuse severe cerebral edema. After these tests, stimulus to the trapezius muscle resulted in bilateral lower-limb extensor posturing. The next day, on repeated examination, the patient no longer had any response to stimulus, and was declared brain dead. This case raised two questions. Why should an intermittent lower-limb withdrawal response to supraclavicular stimulus be a more critical brain function, precluding a diagnosis of brain death (indicating that the patient has not lost integrative unity of the organism), than all other clinical and radiological findings? Was the withdrawal response of spinal origin or brainstem origin? How one chooses to interpret the withdrawal of lower limbs elicited by supraclavicular stimulus directly determines whether the patient in this case was dead."

CD009694,0,7566383,0,Associated injuries and mechanism of atlanto-occipital dislocation caused by trauma.,"Injuries associated with traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) leading to death were analyzed in 11 patients, nine injured by traffic accidents, of which five were victims of car-pedestrian accidents. On admission, unconsciousness and respiratory arrest were noted in all patients, and cardiac arrest in nine. Skull and cervical roentgenograms revealed enlargement of the retropharyngeal space due to injury of the vertebral artery or its branches in nine patients, atlanto-axial dislocation (C-1-C-2 separation) in four, and skull fracture in four. Computed tomography demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the upper cervical and posterior fossa in nine patients, fourth ventricular hematoma in seven, and atlas fracture in three. SAH and ventricular hematoma were due to craniocervical injury. Other common injuries were injury of face and head excluding the mandibular region in 10 patients, mandibular fracture in three, severe chest injuries in eight, and intraperitoneal bleeding in two. The overall outcome was poor. Nine patients died within 13 hours of admission, one was diagnosed as brain dead 8 days after the accident, and the other one survived in a persistent vegetative state. Early death is probably caused by associated severe injuries, i.e. chest injuries and intraperitoneal bleeding rather than AOD. Although injury of the mandibular region is known to be associated with AOD, head, breast, and abdominal trauma may also lead to neck hyperextension-flexion in various directions. Whatever the direct cause, a distractive force to the craniocervical joint by hyperextension-flexion appears to be important in the mechanism of AOD."
CD009694,0,15621136,0,A case report of split liver transplantation for two adult recipients in Korea.,"We report a case of split liver transplantation (SLT) for two adult recipients, which was the first successful case in Korea. The brain-dead donor was a 22-year-old man weighing 65 kg, but his liver volume was estimated as 2120 mL on computed tomographic volumetry. As it seemed to be too large for a 60-kg recipient candidate, SLT was planned after assessment of lobar liver volume and middle hepatic vein anatomy. The right lobe was mobilized first and the liver parenchyma transected along the right border of the middle hepatic vein. The 1240-g right lobe (segments 5 to 8) graft was implanted into a 57-year-old male patient with acute-on-chronic liver failure in the same manner as a living-donor graft. After that, routine procedures of cadaveric multiorgan procurement were performed. The 670-g left lobe (segments 1 to 4) with a retrohepatic vena cava, common bile duct, and aortic patch was implanted into another 37-year-old male recipient. These two recipients recovered uneventfully surviving 12 months to date.

CD009694,0,7933514,0,[Hypoxic brain damage after prolonged cardiac arrest during anesthesia--changes in CT and serum NSE concentration].,"A 48-year-old woman was scheduled for total hysterectomy under spinal anesthesia in a local hospital. Large doses of diazepam (20 mg) and pentazocine (30 mg) were administered for sedation five minutes after starting the operation. Four minutes later, cardiac arrest occurred. The patient did not respond to closed chest massage and was transferred to our institution. As closed chest massage was not effective because the patient was moderately obese and her abdomen was open, open chest massage was initiated with administration of a large dose of epinephrine. Five minutes later, cardiac rhythm was restored, but it had taken a total of 75 minutes to restore cardiac rhythm and the patient suffered brain death. The cause of cardiac arrest was suspected to be a lethal dose of sedatives under spinal anesthesia. CT revealed massive cerebral edema soon after resuscitation. Serum NSE (neuron specific enolase) was within normal limits (< 10 ng.ml-1) at that time, but on the following day the CT demonstrated low attenuation area of white matter and gray matter in the cerebrum and brainstem, and serum NSE increased to 357 ng.ml-1, indicating massive necrosis of neuronal cells. The high concentration of serum NSE persisted for four days, and subsequently decreased to 112 ng.ml-1. This may have been a sign of completion of washout after brain death with no cerebral perfusion. It was concluded that if a case of cardiac arrest does not respond to closed chest massage, immediate open chest massage should be considered and that serum NSE may be an indicator of prognosis of hypoxic cerebral injury."

In Canada we accept the clinical criteria for brain death (essentially brain stem death) when they can be legitimately applied. Ancillary tests are needed when these clinical criteria cannot be applied or when there are confounders. Ancillary tests include tests of intracranial blood circulation, electrophysiological tests, metabolic studies and tests for residual vagus nerve function. The ideal confirmatory test is one which, when positive, would be incompatible with recoverable brain function (i.e., has no false positives), is not influenced by drugs or metabolic disturbances and which can be readily applied.

A severe syndrome of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and non-oliguric renal insufficiency developed. Following clinical and neurophysiological examination the patient was declared brain-dead, and the family gave permission for organ donation. The left kidney was transplanted and functioned well immediately. However, in view of the DIC and renal function disorders the right kidney was not considered usable for transplantation elsewhere.

Due to the possible presence of residual postoperative neuromuscular blockade after surgery, a processed electroencephalograph (EEG) was applied prior to starting sedation. This was markedly abnormal in all three cases, and not in keeping with the residual anesthesia. The patients were immediately transported for a CT scan. In all three cases there was severe neurological injury incompatible with survival and end of life decisions were made. Although the utility of quantitative EEG technology, like the Bispectral index (BIS) or Patient State Analyzer (PSA), is becoming better defined in the operating room, the role in the ICU is less clear. We propose that the ICU use of the PSA 4000 may have affected our decision weighing the risk versus benefit of transporting a fresh postoperative case to the radiology suite, expedited the neurological diagnosis, and may have reduced overall ICU resource utilization."

This was followed by supra-aortic trunk and brain artery angiography with acquisition of images using 0.5 mm slices, from the origin of the aortic root to the vertex. In all the patients, BD diagnosis was verified by clinical examination, EEG and TCD. Brain perfusion never detected brain blood flow. The angioCT through internal carotid arteries and vertebral arteries demonstrated complete absence of intracranial circulation, observing circulation of the external carotid artery branches. Sensitivity and specificity of the method compared with clinical examination was 100%. These findings demonstrate that the study of brain perfusion and brain angiography by multislice CT scan is a rapid and minimally invasive technique, that is easily available and that shows the absence of brain blood flow through the four vascular trunks.

CD009694,0,20095080,0,Specificity of radionuclide brain blood flow testing in brain death: case report and review.,"Brain blood flow tests with diffusible radiopharmaceuticals are often done as an ancillary test in brain death (BD). We report a case of an infant with absent brain blood flow on an anterior planar image despite persistent breathing and extensor posturing. We reviewed the literature from 1980 to 2008 using MEDLINE and PubMed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of these tests in the diagnosis of BD. Search terms were any combination of: brain death; and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), radiopharmaceuticals, technetium Tc 99m exametazime, or organotechnetium compounds. The sensitivity of absent brain blood flow on planar imaging for clinically confirmed BD is 119/153 = 77.8% [95% CI 70.5%-83.7%]; and the specificity is 41/41 (100%) [95% CI 92.6%-100%]. For clinically confirmed BD, the sensitivity of SPECT is 107/121 (88.4%) [95% CI 81.4%-93.1%], and specificity is 12/12 (100%) [95% CI 78.4%-100%]. For contrast angiography confirmed BD, the sensitivity of SPECT is 34/34 (100%) [95% CI 91.2%-100%]; the specificity could not be estimated as there were no patients without clinical BD having both tests. Case reports emphasized the possibility of isolated posterior-fossa blood flow, which would not be detectable using non-diffusible radiopharmaceuticals, or without a lateral view using diffusible agents. We conclude that patients having an ancillary radiopharmaceutical brain blood flow test for BD should have anterior and lateral views without exception. Larger numbers of patients both with and without BD (but with severe brain injury) must be studied to determine the sensitivity and specificity of these tests"

A previously healthy 4-year-old girl was admitted to the emergency room with sensory failure and trembling. The previous week she had suffered from a transitory ischemic attack that resolved spontaneously. On admission to the emergency department, the Glasgow Coma Scale score was 10/15 and she presented irregular polypneic breathing, anisocoric reactive pupils, enhanced reflexes, lower limb clonus and bilateral pyramidal signs. Cranial computed tomography revealed marked hypodensity in both cerebellar hemispheres and white supratentorial substance with obliteration of the quadrigeminus cisterns. Cerebral angiography showed left vertebral artery dissection with distal pseudoaneurysm and marked basilar occlusion. Despite aggressive antiedemic treatment and early instauration of intravenous continuous sodium heparin infusion, the patient developed a bilateral cerebellar infarction and supratentorial hydrocephalus. Brain death was diagnosed after 48 hours. Postmortem pathologic examination revealed previous thrombus the in superior left cerebellar artery and basilar artery occlusion.

Disseminated Nocardiosis affecting the central nervous system (CNS), abdomen, skin, and lungs has been described in bone marrow, lung, and kidney transplant recipients. However, to our knowledge, no cases involving all of these structures have been reported in liver transplant recipients. Herein, we have reported a case of CNS, pulmonary, and cutaneous nocardiosis in a liver transplant recipient who experienced hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and received the organ from a non-heart-beating donor. At posttransplantation month 7 the patient was admitted to the emergency department with poor general health status, fever, edema, and subcutaneous nodules in the legs. A computed tomography scan revealed multiple nodules disseminated through both lungs, abdomen, brain, and subcutaneous tissue. A needle biopsy was performed into one of the subcutaneous nodules. Cultures of the material tested positive for Nocardia farcinica. Thus, we started treatment with intravenous sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMZ-TMP), shifting after 1 month to oral therapy. Radiological examination performed after 2 weeks of treatment showed a 70% reduction in subcutaneous, pulmonary, and cerebral lesions. After 6 months of SMZ-TMP treatment, the patient remained free of the symptoms with involution of the subcutaneous nodules and significant radiological improvement. Among opportunistic infections appearing in liver transplant recipients, Nocardia species should have special consideration according to the success of early treatment and the bad prognosis in cases of delayed diagnosis."
CD009694,0,11002483,0,[Neuromonitoring of acute internal carotid artery occlusion].,"We experienced a patient with acute thrombosis of the unilateral internal carotid artery. We monitored the brain tissue temperature and intracranial pressure not only in both hemispheres simultaneously but also continuously throughout the process of brain death. The patient was a 73-year-old male who presented to our emergency room with right hemiparesis and aphasia. On admission to our department, no specific pathological findings were identified by brain CT. However a following investigation with left carotid arteriogram demonstrated a complete occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. Probes to monitor intraparenchymal temperature (Tip) and intracranial pressure(ICP) were inserted surgically into the bilateral hemispheres, and these two parameters were monitored continuously until the patient's death. Initially, Tip in the infarcted hemisphere was lower than that in the intact hemisphere, and the left hemisphere's ICP was significantly higher than that of the right one. When the ICP in the left hemisphere exceeded 40 mmHg, bilateral ICPs became equal. Brain herniation was confirmed when the ICP became progressively elevated thereafter. Subsequently the bilateral Tips became equal and lower than the bladder temperature following the brain herniation. In this case, we successfully monitored two parameters while the patient was in the process of brain death; i.e., brain ischemia, complete loss of brain circulation and subsequent decrease in the brain tissue temperature."

CD009694,0,2980592,0,Comparison of cerebral blood flow measurements by xenon computed tomography and dynamic brain scintigraphy in clinically brain dead children.,"Because of the controversy over applying adult clinical and laboratory criteria to children suspected of brain death, xenon computed tomographic cerebral blood flow (XeCTCBF) and near simultaneous scintigraphy were studied in 10 children. Six met the clinical criteria, one of whom had three indeterminate scintigrams with only central flow on XeCTCBF. Another had considerable flow with scintigraphy and XeCTCBF. One with clinical and autopsy brainstem death but preserved cortical function also had flow on both. This preliminary study establishes that brain scintigraphy is occasionally hypersensitive to insufficient cerebral flow and promises more accurate early assessment with XeCTCBF. The expectation is that XeCTCBF can refine the criteria for the earlier establishment of brain death."
CD009694,0,16562795,0,Fatal giant pediatric intracranial cavernous angioma.,"Cavernous angioma is a benign vascular lesion that may occur in the central nervous system. The symptoms of raised intracranial pressure or consciousness alteration are usually related to acute hemorrhage. A previously healthy four-year-old girl was admitted with sudden loss of consciousness, vomiting and clonic seizures. Her Glasgow coma score (GCS) was 7 at presentation (5 m 1v 1e). Anisocoria and mydriasis were present on the right. Computerized tomography revealed a giant spherical, hyperdense intraaxial left frontoparietal lesion. The findings of surrounding vasogenic edema and compression of the adjacent lateral ventricle were seen on computerized tomography (CT). She was taken to operation and the mass was grossly excised. The GCS remained unchanged. A diagnosis of brain death was made. A cavernous hemangioma was diagnosed with pathologic examination. In conclusion, a cavernous angioma may occasionally follow a rapid and fatal course by causing gross hemorrhage in the pediatric age group. Early recognition by CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prompt surgical evacuation are necessary."

CD009694,0,20232671,0,[Usefulness of transcranial Doppler in brain death confirmation].,"Brain death is a clinical diagnosis and must be confirmed by one paraclinical test. This report presents the usefulness of paraclinical tests applied during a 4-year period. Forty-four patients with severe brain lesions leading to brain death were treated during the 2004-2007 period. The appropriate test was chosen according to test availability and patient condition, appreciating restrictions according to the test protocol. Since the results of some tests were inconclusive, some patients underwent repeat testing with the same or different methods. Among 44 patients, 19 had neurotrauma, 11 massive aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, 1 massive arteriovenous subarachnoid and parenchymal hemorrhage, 12 hypertensive parenchymal hemorrhage, and 1 ischemic stroke. As a primary test, transcranial Doppler (TCD) was used in 30, brain scintigraphy in 2, multislice computed tomography angiography (MSCTA) in 10, and cerebral angiography in 2 patients; the diagnosis was confirmed in 26, 3, 9 and 2 patients, respectively. Due to inconclusive test results, MSCTA had to be repeated in 4 patients twice, and in one patient three times. Four patients where TCD was used died during the observation period, and in one patient the hemodynamic spectrum was inconclusive. In most patients (65%), TCD confirmed the clinical diagnosis of brain death, and in 61% the diagnosis was confirmed within a 2-hour period. TCD was the most useful confirmatory test for cerebral circulatory arrest in brain death diagnosis."

CD009694,0,12867872,0,Intracranial hemorrhage resulting from skull base fracture as a complication of Le Fort III osteotomy.,"Various complications of Le Fort osteotomies have been reported. We describe a lethal complication of Le Fort III osteotomy we encountered in a 9-year-old boy with Crouzon syndrome. A standard Le Fort III osteotomy, including pterygomaxillary dysjunction with a curved osteotome and down-fracture manipulation, was performed uneventfully. When the intraoral buccal wound was closed after fixation of the external midface distraction devices, we discovered hemorrhage originating from the right posterior maxillary region. Although it was stopped with pressure on the osteotomized maxilla, the volume of intraoperative blood loss was nearly 2,000 ml. During the observation period in the intensive care unit, the patient suffered brain death, and he died 3 months later. A computed tomography scan obtained the day after surgery revealed vigorous subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage and transverse fracture of the middle cranial fossa. This skull base fracture was believed to result from intraoperative maneuvers, including the pterygomaxillary dysjunction and down-fracture manipulation. We emphasize the risk of intracranial hemorrhage with Le Fort osteotomy and advise discussing this risk with patients and family members during preoperative consultations."

The virtual immediate localization of Tc-99m HMPAO to cerebral and cerebellar tissue provides an index of blood perfusion, and its absence denotes brain death. Other methods for assessing brain death include cerebral angiography, MRI, CT imaging after inhalation of stable xenon, electroencephalography, and clinical examination.

CD009694,0,8092571,0,[Shaken baby syndrome].,"The shaken baby syndrome is a relatively recent concept concerning mishandled children and characterized by cerebral lesions (subarachnoid haemorrhage, oedema, axonal injuries). A case is reported of a 11-month-old female infant, who was admitted in a paediatric intensive care unit with clinical signs of brain death after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The CT scan showed subdural haemorrhage. Pathological examination confirmed the major blunt head trauma. The father admitted that he had shaken his daughter as ""she cried too often"". The mechanism of the lesions is a combination of several factors, especially the large size of infant's head and the weakness of the neck muscles. It is possible to recognize still in the perinatal period children at risk of mishandling, allowing an efficient prevention of the shaken baby syndrome."
CD009694,0,9370017,0,Serious brain injury from traffic-related causes: priorities for primary prevention.,"This study evaluated the incidence and outcome of serious brain injury from traffic-related causes in 695 patients admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery at Karolinska Hospital during 1981-1992. A total of 37.3% of patients were car occupants, 28.1% pedestrians, 12.9% bicyclists, 12.2% car-bicycle/car-moped and 9.5% motorcycle riders. The dominating injury was brain contusion (61.6%) verified with computerized tomography. The level of consciousness was evaluated by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and outcome by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge and 6-36 months thereafter. The final outcome was 67.5% good recovery (GOS 4-5), 11.5% severely disabled (GOS 2-3) and 21.0% GOS 1 or brain dead. Patients with GOS < 4 (32.5%) were severely disabled and motivate priorities for injury prevention. Car occupants represent 40.7% of the total, followed by pedestrians at 33.6% and bicyclists at 18.2%. Much remains to be done in the primary prevention of disabling brain injury to car occupants and pedestrians. In order to achieve a more-effective primary prevention, future research should be directed toward biomechanical aspects of brain contusion as a dominating brain injury."
CD009694,0,18973057,1,A review of ancillary tests in evaluating brain death.,"The neurological determination of death (NDD) is primarily considered to be clinical. However, situations may arise where confounding factors make this clinical assessment difficult or impossible. As a result, ancillary tests have been developed in order to aid in the confirmation of brain death. As assessment of neuronal electrical activity; electroencephalography (EEG) is no longer recommended in this determination, tools assessing cerebral perfusion, as reflected by the presence or absence of cerebral blood flow (CBF), are the mainstay of NDD. The preferred ancillary test currently is Hexamethylpropylene amine oxime-single photon emission computed tomography (HMPAO SPECT) radionuclide angiography. When this is not available, or is equivocal, 4-vessel cerebral angiography can be used to determine the presence or absence of intracranial blood flow. However, as cerebral angiography has its own limitations, other techniques are sought by physicians in the Intensive Care and Neuro-intensive Care settings to replace cerebral angiography. In this article, we briefly review the history of diagnosis of brain death, pathophysiologic issues in making this determination, and currently available CBF imaging techniques, discussing each in turn with respect to their utility in the diagnosis of brain death."
CD009694,0,16397761,0,[Fatal course after osteosynthesis in a 18-year-old male].,"A previously healthy patient became comatose 8 h after osteosynthesis of a fractured femur and humerus. After an initially normal cranial computed tomography, extended lesions were found 10 h later in the control scan as an indication of an embolization in the basilar artery. After neurosurgeons assessed the situation to be unfavorable, no other interventions were conducted and 6 days later brain death was confirmed. During the subsequent heart transplantation the suspicion of a patent foramen ovale as the reason for the paradoxical cerebral embolization was confirmed. This tragic course raises the question whether a patent foramen ovale should be excluded or closed by interventional measures in similar situations."
CD009694,0,1346954,0,Fatal rodenticide poisoning with brodifacoum.,"The increased prevalence of rodents resistant to warfarin led to the development of the hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant brodifacoum. A 25-year-old man attempted suicide by consuming four boxes of d-CON Mouse-Prufe II; each box contains 42 g of bait that is 0.005% brodifacoum. He presented to a hospital nine days later with syncope, hematochezia, gross hematuria, epistaxis, anemia, and a severe coagulopathy. Radiographic studies were consistent with pleural, pericardial, and mediastinal hemorrhages. Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma were given, and he was later discharged on oral phytonadione (vitamin K1). The patient's coagulopathy recurred, necessitating multiple plasma transfusions and prolonged treatment with oral phytonadione. Fifteen weeks after hospital discharge, he presented again with a history of additional brodifacoum ingestion. Neurologic status was initially normal, but in the emergency department he suddenly became comatose soon after emesis was induced with syrup of ipecac. Computed tomography of the brain revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage that led to brain death less than 24 hours later. This case demonstrates the severe and prolonged coagulopathy that can result from ingestion of brodifacoum, a compound that has a toxic potency about 200-fold that of warfarin and a half-life as much as 60 times longer."

CD009694,0,15525292,0,Undulating toe movements in brain death.,"For many years, death implied immobility. Nevertheless, there are anecdotal reports of spontaneous or reflex movements (SRMs) in patients with Brain death (BD). The presence of some movements can preclude the diagnosis of BD, and consequently, the possibility of organ donation for transplantation. McNair and Meador [(1992), Mov Dord7: 345-347] described the presence of undulating toe flexion movements (UTF) in BD patients. UTF consists in a sequential brief plantar flexion of the toes. Our aim was to determine the frequency, characteristics and predisposing factors of UTF movements in a prospective multicenter cohort study of patients with BD. Patients with confirmed diagnosis of BD were assessed to evaluate the presence of UTF using a standardized protocol. All patients had a routine laboratory evaluation, CT scan of the head, and EEG. Demographic, clinical, hemodynamic and blood gas concentration factors were analyzed. amongst 107 BD patients who fulfilled the AAN requirements, 47 patients (44%) had abnormal movements. UTF was observed in 25 (23%) being the most common movement (53%). Early evaluation (OR 4.3, CI95% 1.5-11.9) was a predictor of UTF in a multivariate regression model. The somato-sensory evoked potential (SSEPs) as well as brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) did not elicit a cortical response in studied patients with UTF. This spinal reflex is probably integrated in the L5 and S1 segments of the spinal cord. Abnormal movements are common in BD, being present in more than 40% of individuals. UTF was the most common spinal reflex. In our sample, early evaluation was a predictor of UTF. Health care professionals, especially those involved in organ procurement for transplantation, must be aware of this sign. The presence of this motor phenomenon does not preclude the diagnosis of BD."
CD009694,0,22385083,0,Basilar artery thrombosis after reduction of cervical spondyloptosis: a cautionary report.,"Traumatic cervical spondyloptosis is a rare clinical entity typically associated with complete neurological deficit. The inherent mechanics of this fracture-dislocation pattern contorts the vertebral arteries in such a way that it may result in dissection or compromised flow through those vessels. Thus, intimal injury or thrombus from stasis of flow may result. Reduction of the spondyloptosis restores flow to the vertebral arteries, but it also may mobilize thrombus or propagate an intimal dissection within the previously contorted vessel. The authors review their experience in the care of a 43-year-old man who sustained C4-5 spondyloptosis while riding an all-terrain vehicle. On arrival, the patient demonstrated no motor function below C-4 but had sensation to the nipple line (American Spinal Injury Association Spinal Cord Injury Classification B). The patient's cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. Computed tomography of the cervical spine demonstrated complete spondyloptosis at C4-5. The patient was immediately placed in cervical traction and taken to the operating room for open reduction of the fracture dislocation, decompression of the spinal cord, and stabilization with an interbody graft and cervical plate. Preoperative cervical traction was successful in only partial reduction of the fracture dislocation. Open reduction was achieved with exposure of the C-4 and C-5 bodies and sequential distraction. After anatomical alignment was achieved, an interbody graft was placed and a cervical plate secured. A subsequent decline in the patient's level of consciousness prompted CT of the head, which showed evidence of a basilar artery thrombosis. A CT angiographic study demonstrated patency of the vertebral arteries, but a mid-basilar artery thrombosis. The patient progressed to brain death 24 hours after reduction of the fracture dislocation. The degree of contortion of the vertebral arteries in cervical spondyloptosis in the upper cervical spine may result in stasis of flow with subsequent formation of thrombus or intimal injury. After anatomical reduction, restoration of flow within the vertebral arteries may mobilize the thrombus or propagate an intimal dissection and result in subsequent embolic events. Endovascular evaluation may be warranted immediately after anatomical reduction of a high cervical spondyloptosis for evaluation of the vertebral arteries and possible thrombus dissolution or retrieval."

CT perfusion applications have focused on ischemic stroke with only a short series of applications to brain death diagnosis. Instead, CT angiography is frequently performed as a confirmatory test of brain death, but it has not been completely validated yet. Hence CT perfusion may help in supporting the diagnosis of brain death. We present the case of a 12-year-old child with clinical criteria for brain death who required a confirmatory test. CT angiography and CT perfusion were performed. Both revealed the absence of any intracranial blood flow which supported the clinical diagnosis of brain death."

We performed an orthotopic liver transplantation that required a complex vascular reconstruction using donor vascular grafts. A patient with hepatitis B virus cirrhosis received a liver from a brain-dead donor. Dynamic computed tomography revealed complete obstruction of the portal vein due to thrombosis as well as narrowing of the hepatic arteries. We employed orthotopic liver transplantation using the piggy-back technique with complex reconstruction of the portal vein and the hepatic arteries. For portal vein reconstruction, we used the donor's iliac vein as an interpositional conduit from the recipient's gastric coronary vein to graft the portal vein. The hepatic arteries of the graft were reconstructed at the back-table before anastomosis to the side of superior mesenteric artery using an interpositional conduit of the donor's external iliac artery. All postoperative studies revealed good graft function with an excellent blood flow through all vascular anastomoses during the first year postoperatively."

We treated two patients with meningeal hemangiopericytoma manifesting as life-threatening massive intracerebral hemorrhage. Case 1: A 66-year-old woman presented with consciousness disturbance and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography showed a mass lesion in the right frontal parasagittal region and massive hematoma in the brain tissue at the medial border of the lesion. Immediate evacuation of the hematoma was performed. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-enhanced mass lesion with small intratumoral hemorrhage. The tumor was removed totally through a bilateral frontal craniotomy. The postoperative course was uneventful. The histological diagnosis was meningeal hemangiopericytoma. Radiotherapy was not performed. Case 2: A 59-year-old man presented with consciousness disturbance. Computed tomography showed a mass lesion in the right frontotemporal convexity region and massive hematoma in the brain tissue at the medial border of the lesion. His neurological condition was refractory to any treatment and the clinical diagnosis of brain death was confirmed. Autopsy was performed and the histological diagnosis was meningeal hemangiopericytoma. Meningeal hemangiopericytoma manifesting as intracranial hemorrhage is quite rare, but carries the risk of life-threatening massive bleeding from the tumor."
CD009694,0,15964320,0,Brain death after severe traumatic brain injury: the role of systemic secondary brain insults.,"Secondary brain insults predominantly due to hypotension are frequent among patients with fatal traumatic brain injury. We assessed the correlation between different systemic secondary brain insults and brain death in 404 patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) after severe traumatic brain injury. We collated data on hypoxemia and hypotension prior to as well as the occurrence of hypoxemia, hypotension, shock, anemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperthermia within the first 24 hours after ICU admission. We also considered both the presence of extracranial injuries and the category of traumatic brain injury using computerized tomography. The 59 patients (14.6%) who developed brain death, were significantly older than patients without a fatal neurological outcome (46.1 +/- 22 vs 29.5 +/- 14.9 years; P < .0001). Intracranial mass lesions, whether surgically evacuated were more frequent among brain-dead patients. The systemic secondary brain insults significantly associated with brain death were hypoxemia, hypotension, shock, anemia, and hyperglycemia within the first 24 hours after ICU admission. After multivariate analysis, the factors that independently predicted brain death were the occurrence of shock (odds ratio [OR], 6.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.85-15.84; P = .001) and older age (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07; P = .003). In conclusion, early shock seems to be the major systemic secondary brain insult associated with brain death in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Prevention of or correction of shock might help to either decrease the occurrence of a fatal neurological outcome or in brain-dead patients to preserve organs in better condition for procurement."

A short time later he is found unconscious by the roadside, with severe head injuries. En route to hospital by ambulance, he suffers a cardiac arrest and is successfully resuscitated. On arrival at the Emergency Department he has obvious head injuries and is deeply unconscious, but shows spontaneous ventilatory movements. Available history is that he is a 20-year-old student with well-controlled epilepsy for which he takes phenytoin. It is not known how he sustained his injuries. Pupils are equal, small and react sluggishly to light. There is generalised flaccidity and an extensor-plantar response to painful stimuli. Skull x-rays show no fractures and computed tomography shows early cerebral oedema and scattered cerebral contusions with evidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage. He is transferred to the intensive care unit and measures to inhibit cerebral oedema, including mannitol, are commenced. An N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) inhibitor is administered for neuroprotection and ventilatory support is commenced. Over the next 24 hours haemodynamic support is needed with fluid loading and vasopressors. A urine drug screen by Toxilab (Toxilab Incorporated, Irvine, Calif.) shortly after arrival shows the presence of phenytoin and morphine. The report states that the presence of benzodiazepines is suspected. Plasma phenytoin concentration at the time of arrival was 78 mumol/L (optimal range, 40-80 mumol/L). Forty hours after admission his condition has deteriorated. His pupils are at midposition, no longer reactive to light and his lower limbs exhibit only spinal reflexes. His relatives begin to prepare themselves for the fact he may not survive and raise the issue that he would have been keen to donate organs under such circumstances.

Electrophysiological tests are often unavailable. Therefore, cerebral perfusion testing is the method of choice with four-vessel digital subtraction angiography (DSA), the gold standard. Unfortunately, DSA is an expensive and invasive examination that requires an experienced neuroradiologist and the availability of an angiography suite. Recently, multirow computed tomographic devices became available, even in smaller hospitals in Poland.

The BAEPs were recorded in the first 72 h after hospital admission and the findings of 29 patients related to the level of neurological recovery at 6 months after head injury. On the basis of the results, children were divided into three groups: the first consisted of children with bilateral and normal BAEPs (n = 19); the second of those with asymmetrical BAEPs (n = 6); and the third of those in whom BAEPs has disappeared or in whom only responses of the seventh cranial nerve and cochlear nucleus were recorded (n = 4). All the patients in the first group presented a good clinical outcome, with excellent recovery in 80%. In the second group three children (42.8%) had a good recovery, two (28.6%) were moderately disabled and one (14.3%) died of extraneurological causes. All the patients in the third group died. Abnormal BAEPs showed a significant correlation with absence of pupillary and/or corneal reflex, but not with the Glasgow Coma Score and anisocoria. Good statistical correlation was observed between normal BAEPs and visualization of basal cisterns on computed tomographic scan. The incidence of increased intracranial pressure was higher in patients with abnormal BAEPs, but the differences were not significant (P = 0.06). Our study confirms the predictive value of BAEPs in children's post-traumatic coma due to diffuse brain injury."
CD009694,0,17067923,0,A dangerous dilemma: management of infectious intracranial aneurysms complicating endocarditis.,"A 41-year-old right-handed man with bicuspid aortic valve and a 3-month history of chronic fever and weight loss presented with sudden onset of severe headache. Computerised tomography of the head revealed a right basal ganglia haemorrhage. Further investigation documented Streptococcus mitis bacteraemia, a fusiform right middle cerebral artery aneurysm, and an abscess at the base of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The patient subsequently died when repeat aneurysmal haemorrhage resulted in cerebral herniation and brain death while on antibiotic therapy. Infectious intracranial aneurysms (IIAs) are uncommon but severe complications of bacterial endocarditis. Several case series have been published evaluating the management of IIAs, but no randomised controlled trials exist to guide treatment decisions. Improved diagnostic techniques, microvascular neurosurgical approaches, and endovascular therapies hold the promise of improved outcomes in the future. This difficult case is used to show an approach towards the management of IIAs complicating bacterial endocarditis based on a review of the published work."
