This paper reviews imaging and endoscopy of gastric tumors in dogs and cats and the techniques used. The appearance of the normal as well as the various aspects of gastric tumors are described for these different modalities. Plain radiography is widely available but has limited diagnostic value. Contrast radiography has higher sensitivity but is laborious and time-consuming. Ultrasonography (if an adequate acoustic window is available), endosonography and endoscopy are the most appropriate modalities for diagnosing gastric tumors. They are especially useful when obtaining samples for cytologic or histopathologic examination, because the imaging modalities do not always differentiate between inflammatory or infectious conditions and neoplastic disorders. Hydro-helical CT was found helpful for evaluating the location and local invasiveness of the lesion. Ultrasonography and endoscopy are useful modalities for taking adequate biopsies."

In contrast to pancreatic cancer, ampullary cancer is often curable if detected at an early stage. The evaluation and management of ampullary cancer is similar to, but distinct from, that of other pancreaticobiliary tumors. This manuscript will review the current evaluation, diagnosis, and therapy of patients with ampullary cancer. The diagnosis of ampullary cancer is complicated by its similar clinical presentation to pancreatic cancer as well as its nonspecific laboratory findings. Diagnostic modalities such as ERCP, EUS, and biopsy are necessary for differentiating the 2 cancers, and noninvasive imaging techniques such as MRI and CT may be used for tumor staging. Although pancreaticoduodenectomy is considered the primary curative surgical option, consensus guidelines regarding adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapies are lacking."

CD009944,0,25400441,0,"Utility of PET/CT in diagnosis, staging, assessment of resectability and metabolic response of pancreatic cancer.","Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common gastrointestinal tumors, with its incidence staying at a high level in both the United States and China. However, the overall 5-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer is still extremely low. Surgery remains the only potential chance for long-term survival. Early diagnosis and precise staging are crucial to make proper clinical decision for surgery candidates. Despite advances in diagnostic technology such as computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound, diagnosis, staging and monitoring of the metabolic response remain a challenge for this devastating disease. Positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT), a relatively novel modality, combines metabolic detection with anatomic information. It has been widely used in oncology and achieves good results in breast cancer, lung cancer and lymphoma. Its utilization in pancreatic cancer has also been widely accepted. However, the value of PET/CT in pancreatic disease is still controversial. Will PET/CT change the treatment strategy for potential surgery candidates? What kind of patients benefits most from this exam? In this review, we focus on the utility of PET/CT in diagnosis, staging, and assessment of resectability of pancreatic cancer. In addition, its ability to monitor metabolic response and recurrence after treatment will be emphasis of discussion. We hope to provide answers to the questions above, which clinicians care most about."

CD009944,0,25347506,0,Can we predict complete or major response after chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer by noninvasive methods? Results of a prospective study on 61 patients.,"Rectal preservation has been proposed as an alternative to radical resection in patients with presumed complete or major response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the accuracy of digital rectal examination (DRE) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict major or complete rectal cancer response to CRT. Over 2 years, 61 patients underwent radical resection after CRT for rectal cancer. DRE and MRI were carried out before and 6 to 8 weeks after the end of CRT. Data from DRE and MRI post-CRT were compared with pathological examinations. At pathological examination, major/complete responses were recorded for tumors classified ypT1N0 and ypT0N0, respectively. DRE post-CRT showed major/complete response in 26 cases, of which 14 (54%) were confirmed by pathology. The positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values of DRE to predict major/complete response were 54 and 88 per cent, respectively. MRI post-CRT showed major/complete response in 12 cases, of which nine (75%) were confirmed by pathology. The PPV and NPV of MRI to predict major/complete response were 75 and 82 per cent, respectively. Data from DRE and RMI post-CRT were concordant in 45 patients. The PPV and NPV of concordant DRE and MRI to predict major/complete response were 82 and 91 per cent, respectively. DRE and MRI do not appear to be sufficiently accurate for safe selection of patients appropriate for a rectum-sparing strategy because the risk of leaving an invasive tumor untreated is 18 per cent."
CD009944,0,25333398,0,American Pancreatic Association Practice Guidelines in Chronic Pancreatitis: evidence-based report on diagnostic guidelines.,"The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis remains challenging in early stages of the disease. This report defines the diagnostic criteria useful in the assessment of patients with suspected and established chronic pancreatitis. All current diagnostic procedures are reviewed, and evidence-based statements are provided about their utility and limitations. Diagnostic criteria for chronic pancreatitis are classified as definitive, probable, or insufficient evidence. A diagnostic (STEP-wise; survey, tomography, endoscopy, and pancreas function testing) algorithm is proposed that proceeds from a noninvasive to a more invasive approach. This algorithm maximizes specificity (low false-positive rate) in subjects with chronic abdominal pain and equivocal imaging changes. Furthermore, a nomenclature is suggested to further characterize patients with established chronic pancreatitis based on TIGAR-O (toxic, idiopathic, genetic, autoimmune, recurrent, and obstructive) etiology, gland morphology (Cambridge criteria), and physiologic state (exocrine, endocrine function) for uniformity across future multicenter research collaborations. This guideline will serve as a baseline manuscript that will be modified as new evidence becomes available and our knowledge of chronic pancreatitis improves."
CD009944,0,25320516,0,"New approaches to gastric cancer staging: beyond endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography and positron emission tomography.","Currently, there is no single gold standard modality for staging of gastric cancer and several methods have been used complementarily in the each clinical situation. To make up for the shortcomings of conventional modalities such as endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography and (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, numerous attempts with new approaches have been made for gastric cancer staging. For T staging, magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band was evaluated to differentiate mucosal cancer from submucosal cancer. Single/double contrast-enhanced ultrasound and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were also tried to improve diagnostic accuracy of gastric cancer. For intraoperative staging with sentinel node mapping, indocyanine green infrared and fluorescence imaging was introduced. In addition, to detect micrometastasis, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction system with multiple markers was studied. Staging laparoscopy using 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic diagnosis and percutaneous diagnostic peritoneal lavage were also evaluated. However, most studies reporting new staging methods is preliminary and further studies for validation in clinical practice are needed. In this mini-review, we discuss new progress in gastric cancer staging. Especially, we focus on new diagnostic approach to gastric cancer staging beyond the conventional modalities and briefly review the remarkable clinical results of the studies published over the past three years."
CD009944,0,25320515,0,Is endoscopic ultrasonography still the modality of choice in preoperative staging of gastric cancer?,"The treatment option for gastric cancer is usually based on preoperative staging by imaging modalities. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and computed tomography (CT) have been used as the diagnostic modality of choice in preoperative staging of gastric cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been employed in several studies, and ((18)F) 2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has emerged as a new promising imaging modality. The purpose of this article is to provide summarized information on preoperative staging using EUS, multi-detector row CT (MDCT), MRI and PET for gastric cancer. In T staging, both EUS and MDCT show high accuracy. MRI seemed to have better performance, but the number of MRI studies is limited. FDG-PET is not able to properly evaluate the depth of invasion. In N staging, the diagnostic accuracy of EUS, MDCT and MRI is not sufficient. In preoperative M staging, MDCT and FDG-PET showed similar diagnostic accuracies. FDG-PET/CT fusion could be expected to show better performance in the future. Physicians should keep in mind that each diagnostic modality has advantages and limitations and choose an appropriate diagnostic strategy tailored for each patient."
CD009944,0,25310426,0,New TNM staging system for esophageal cancer: what chest radiologists need to know.,"Esophageal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and the 5-year relative survival rate remains less than 20% in the United States. The treatment of esophageal cancer should be stage specific for better clinical outcomes. Recent treatment paradigms tend to involve a multimodality approach to management, which includes surgical resection and preoperative or definitive chemoradiation therapy. Accurate pretreatment staging of esophageal cancer is integral for assessing operability and determining a suitable treatment plan. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) have published the seventh edition of the staging manual for cancer in the esophagus and esophagogastric junction. Unlike the sixth edition, the revised staging manual is data driven and harmonized with the staging of stomach cancer. Improvements include new definitions for the anatomic classifications Tis, T4, regional lymph node, N, and M and the addition of nonanatomic cancer characteristics (histopathologic cell type, histologic grade, and cancer location). Given the recent increase in the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and gastric cardia, the staging of tumors in the esophagogastric junction has been addressed. Radiologists must understand the details of the seventh edition of the AJCC-UICC staging system for esophageal cancer and use appropriate imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography/CT, for initial staging."

CD009944,0,25278693,0,Endoscopic features of gastro-intestinal lymphomas: from diagnosis to follow-up.,"Many progresses have been done in the management of gastrointestinal (GI) lymphomas during last decades, especially after the discovery of Helicobacter pylori-dependent lymphoma development. The stepwise implementation of new endoscopic techniques, by means of echoendoscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy, enabled us to more precisely describe the endoscopic features of GI lymphomas with substantial contribution in patient management and in tailoring the treatment strategy with organ preserving approaches. In this review, we describe the recent progresses in GI lymphoma management from disease diagnosis to follow-up with a specific focus on the endoscopic presentation according to the involved site and the lymphoma subtype. Additionally, new or emerging endoscopic technologies that have an impact on the management of gastrointestinal lymphomas are reported. We here discuss the two most common subtypes of GI lymphomas: the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and the diffuse large B cell lymphoma. A general outline on the state-of-the-art of the disease and on the role of endoscopy in both diagnosis and follow-up will be performed."

CD009944,0,25162448,0,Assessing transgastric Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery prior to clinical implementation.,"The objective was to investigate whether transgastric Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) could be implemented safely in clinical practice. The experimental studies proved ultrasonography guided access through the stomach to be feasible and safe without iatrogenic complications. Although the technique was safe, further development is needed to increase reproducibility and reduce the procedural time used for gaining access. Closing the gastrotomy after the procedure can be performed easily by application of an endoscopic clip (Over-The-Scope-Clip). Microscopic evaluation of excised gastrorrhaphies revealed that sufficient healing had been achieved after long-term follow-up. A fundamental problem with TG peritoneoscopy is the lack of NOTES specific endoscopes. With the combination of intraluminal EUS and peritoneoscopy with extraluminal EUS, it was possible to achieve sufficient visualisation of anatomical structures of interest in the diagnostics and staging of upper gastrointestinal cancers. Another problem with TG NOTES is the risk of intra-abdominal infections. Using a multimodal decontamination regimen reduced the rate of intra-abdominal pathology, but the risk of intra-abdominal abscess formation as a result of contamination from the access route was still present. To reduce this contamination, mouthwash with chlorhexidine was effective in a human randomised study. The same study also found significant higher bacterial load in the stomach of patients using proton pump inhibitor, emphasising the need to pause PPI prior to future TG interventions. Whether the risk of infectious complications after TG NOTES is comparable between animals and humans is debatable. Despite this, the subject of infectious complications and the safety profile of the TG technique require further research. Based on the evidence available in the literature and current experience, clinical implementation to the benefit of patients does not seem justifiable at present time."

Here, we present a histologically conﬁrmed case of primary GP examined with biphasic computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endosonography. A well-circumscribed extraluminal mass appearing as homogeneous attenuation/intensity with gradual enhancement was identified on biphasic enhancement CT and MRI. This mass was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map, implying that water diffusion in the mass was restricted. In addition, endosonography indicated a low echogenic mass in the gastric wall. These imaging findings increase the available knowledge about imaging of this disease and provide valuable information for differentiating primary GP from common gastric tumors."

This report presents two cases of ulcerative EGC in two males, 73- and 80-year-old, with severe fibrosis. As endoscopic ultrasonography suggested that the EGCs had invaded the submucosal layer, the endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection salvage technique was utilized for complete resection of the lesions. Although surgical gastrectomy was originally scheduled, the two patients had severe coronary heart disease, and surgeries were refused because of the risks associated with their heart conditions. The endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection salvage technique procedures described in these cases were performed under conscious sedation, and were completed within 30 min. The complete en bloc resection of EGC using endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection salvage technique was possible with a free resection margin, and no other complications were noted during the procedure. This is the first known report concerning the use of the endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection salvage technique salvage technique for treatment of ulcerative EGC. We demonstrate that endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection salvage technique it is a feasible method showing several advantages over endoscopic submucosal dissection for cases of EGC with fibrosis."

It is difficult to diagnose the tumor before surgery by only endoscopic biopsy and radiography, and there is no established method of diagnosis before surgical treatment. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on a 50-year-old Japanese woman revealed a 10 mm submucosal tumor in the anterior wall of the gastric angle. Follow-up EGD revealed an increase in the size of the tumor to 15mm. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) demonstrated a 15mm subepithelial hypoechoic solid tumor with continuity to the proper muscle layer. Histologic diagnosis by endoscopic ultrasonography guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was glomus tumor. The tumor was treated by laparoscopic local resection. The histologic diagnosis of the resected tumor was similar to the preoperative EUS-FNA results. EUS-FNA would appear to be an effective histologic test for early diagnosis of gastric glomus tumor."

Unfortunately, the results of endoscopic biopsy are not always the same as what is expected based on gross endoscopic findings. The results of endoscopic biopsy can be negative for malignancy in Borrmann type IV advanced gastric cancer (AGCa) or gastric lymphoma. However, in the case of type II AGCa, repeated biopsies negative for malignancy have not been reported. A 49-year-old male patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy three times due to large gastric ulcer suspected to be Borrmann type II cancer. However, three repeat endoscopic biopsies with multiple specimens showed necrosis and superficial regenerative epithelium without malignant findings. The patient underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection. The surgical specimen revealed that the mucosal layer was completely replaced with regenerative epithelium without cancer cells."

Here, we report on the development of a transcardiac endoscopic tunneling technique (TCTT) for the resection of tumors in this area. A total of 18 patients with gastric fundus SMTs arising from the muscularis propria on endoscopic ultrasound underwent TCTT. The procedure involved the excavation of a submucosal tunnel from the esophagus, through the cardia, to the gastric SMT for resection. The tunnel was closed by clips after retrieval of the tumor. The mean tumor size was 2.1 cm (range 0.8 - 5.0 cm). The mean procedure time was 75.1 minutes (range 40 - 100 minutes). Complete resection was achieved in all cases. Iatrogenic perforation occurred in one case. This and one other patient developed mild pneumoperitoneum on the day after the procedure; symptoms resolved under conservative management. No patient developed gastrointestinal leakage, delayed bleeding, or secondary infection. Therefore, in this pilot study, TCTT provided a definitive histological diagnosis as well as a feasible, safe, and easy therapeutic approach for gastric fundus SMTs arising from muscularis propria in the circular area within 8 cm below the cardia."

CD009944,0,25000218,0,Staging of esophageal and gastric cancer in 2014.,"Cancers of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract; esophageal and gastric carcinomas are highly lethal malignancies that have been ranked among the top 10 most frequent cancers and leading causes of cancer-related mortality. Universally, the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging systems provided by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) are used for esophageal and gastric cancers. Accurate locoregional staging has become critical for the application of appropriate stage-specific treatment options in the multimodality treatment era in order to achieve better patient outcomes. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) represents a valuable minimally invasive real-time imaging modality for the assessment of upper GI tract tumors providing evidence for tumor invasion depth and regional nodal involvement corresponding to the T and N status of the TNM staging system, but a clear understanding of its diagnostic performance, limits and complementary role to other imaging modalities is required. This review will focus on the literature about the role and value of EUS in the TNM staging of esophageal and gastric carcinoma. In addition, an overview of the description of the current 7th editions of TNM staging and the revisions of the last editions compared to previous editions are presented."

We report a 51-year-old man with a 25-year history of dysphagia with solids and liquids who failed a trial of proton pump inhibitors and fluticasone. His initial endoscopy revealed a viliform mass with dense eosinophilic infiltrate without neoplasia. Endoscopic ultrasound examination revealed a 4×1.6×0.7 cm mucosal hemicircumferential lesion without regional adenopathy. Pathological findings from the oesophagectomy specimen confirmed oesophageal papillomatosis with no malignancy. Surveillance endoscopy 4 months later revealed the lesion had increased in size. Additional ablative therapies failed, and the patient underwent oesophagectomy. Surveillance CT of the chest and abdomen at 3 months and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy at 6 months were negative. This case illustrates that oesophageal squamous papillomatosis not amenable to medical therapy requires surgical treatment."
CD009944,0,24784121,0,Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer remains the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Risk factors include family history, smoking, chronic pancreatitis, obesity, diabetes mellitus, heavy alcohol use, and possible dietary factors. Because more than two-thirds of adenocarcinomas occur in the head of the pancreas, abdominal pain, jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, and acholic stools may be presenting symptoms. In symptomatic patients, the serum tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 can be used to confirm the diagnosis and to predict prognosis and recurrence after resection. Pancreas protocol computed tomography is considered standard for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. Although surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, less than 20% of surgical candidates survive five years. The decision on resectability requires multidisciplinary consultation. Pancreatic resections should be performed at institutions that complete at least 15 of the surgeries annually. Postoperatively, use of gemcitabine or fluorouracil/leucovorin as adjuvant chemotherapy improves overall survival by several months. However, more than 80% of patients present with disease that is not surgically resectable. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine or irinotecan provides clinical benefit and modest survival improvement. Palliation should address pain control, biliary and gastric outlet obstruction, malnutrition, thromboembolic disease, and depression."

Effective technologies for accurate staging and quantitative evaluation are still in demand to merit reasonable treatment and better prognosis for the patients presented with advanced disease. Preoperative staging using conventional imaging tools, such as computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasonography, is inadequate. Positron emission tomography (PET), using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer and integrating CT for anatomic localization, holds a promise to detect unsuspected metastasis and has been extensively used in a variety of malignancies.

CD009944,0,24659867,0,Helicobacter pylori infection in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.,"Gastrointestinal lymphoma is the most common type of extranodal lymphoma, and most commonly affects the stomach. Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are the most common histologic types of gastric lymphoma. Despite its increasing incidence, diagnosis of gastric lymphoma is difficult at an earlier stage due to its nonspecific symptoms and endoscopic findings, and, thus, a high index of suspicion, and multiple, deep, repeated biopsies at abnormally and normally appearing sites in the stomach are needed. In addition, testing for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and endoscopic ultrasonography to determine the depth of tumor invasion and involvement of regional lymph nodes is essential for predicting response to H. pylori eradication and for assessment of disease progression. In addition, H. pylori infection and MALT lymphoma development are associated, and complete regression of low-grade MALT lymphomas after H. pylori eradication has been demonstrated. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy can be used in cases that show poor response to H. pylori eradication, negativity for H. pylori infection, or high-grade lymphoma."

The patient's hematological, radiographic, ultrasonographic, endoscopic and histological examinations were evaluated for diagnosis. Hematologic analysis indicated moderate anemia and azotemia. Based on the imaging studies, an oval-shaped mass was identified in the gastric pylorus area. A proliferative mass was found on endoscopic examination, and we performed biopsy using grasping forceps. The histopathological findings of the biopsy specimens indicated hypertrophic gastritis, and Y-U pyloroplasty was performed. However, histopathological examination of the surgically resected mass revealed tubular adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Then, carboplatin chemotherapy was performed 4 times for 13 weeks. Clinical signs, such as vomiting, were resolved gradually after surgery and chemotherapy, and the patient's condition was managed favorably until recently (30 months after surgery). This case report describes clinical features, imaging studies, endoscopic characteristics and histopathological and immunohistochemical features of gastric tubular adenocarcinoma as early gastric cancer in a dog."

In this study, we report a new case of this rare gastric tumor with a subset of tumor cells derived from smooth muscle differentiation. A 32-year-old Chinese man was admitted with a gastric mass. He did not experience any discomfort, and gastroscopy showed an elevated mass in the anterior wall of the gastric antrum. Endoscopic ultrasound examination revealed a focal hypoechoic lesion protruding into the lumen. A partial gastrectomy was performed, and the patient made an uneventful recovery and remains well 3 years later. The tumor in this case depicted all the typical histopathologic and immunochemical features of gastric PAMT, except that a small subset of tumor cells was partially immunoreactive for desmin and H-caldesmon. Based on the findings of this case, we think that PAMT may contain tumor cells derived from smooth muscle differentiation, and therefore this tumor may be more than just purely myofibroblastic in nature."

CD009944,0,24369919,0,Prognostic assessment and treatment of primary gastric lymphomas: how endoscopic ultrasonography can help in tailoring patient management.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has recently gained a pivotal role in the management of gastric lymphomas, especially in the diagnostic workup. Its accuracy and reliability have overcome those of other imaging techniques, such that it represents an invaluable tool for the management of gastric lymphomas. Although this technique is operator dependent, its application in large series has proved its reliability. Thus, it has generally been considered a useful tool for providing information crucial in deciding the treatment program, especially for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, for which EUS can provide an accurate evaluation of disease extension and treatment response probability. Limited-stage disease, confined to the submucosa, has a greater probability to respond to sole Helicobacter pylori eradication. In contrast, the value of EUS in response assessment and follow-up monitoring is still debated, with discordant opinions about its reliability and clinical advantages, because normalization of the EUS findings occurs with a considerable delay compared to the histologic evaluation. In the follow-up setting, preliminary data have indicated that persistently positive EUS findings in low-grade gastric lymphoma could represent a warning for a possible relapse. However, in high-grade gastric lymphoma, such findings do not have any clinical implications."

CD009944,0,24154498,0,[Treatment of gastric cancer].,"From a global perspective, gastric cancer including adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction is the fourth most common malignant tumor and the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Due to the lack of specific symptoms of early cancer, most gastric cancers are diagnosed in advanced stages. Staging should include high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis and documented video-endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound. In mucosal gastric cancer, endoscopic resection can replace surgical resection. In more advanced stages, perioperative chemotherapy has been established as a standard of care. In the metastatic setting, treatment goals are palliative. Chemotherapy can prolong survival, improve symptoms, and enhance the quality of life. Combination chemotherapy including a platinum salt plus fluoropyrimidine is the standard of care. About 16 % of gastric cancers exhibit overexpression of the growth factor receptor HER2.

Looking at the literature and analyzing recent personal data, neither pit-pattern classification, nor EUS, nor biopsy histology, nor lifting sign verification, nor digital examination allow a specificity of more than three fourth of such cases. The authors disquisition about which optimal treatment excludes a role for EMR for the impossibility to obtain a single en-bloc specimen, minimum requirement for a correct lateral and vertical margin assessment. For the same reason ESD should be preferred, although a recent meta-analysis of the literature defined that one fourth of patients undergoing ESD for a preoperatively assessed non-invasive large rectal lesion fail to receive an R0 en-bloc resection. This forces about 10% of patients treated by flexible endoscopy to undergo abdominal surgery, which is about fourfold higher than TEM. While awaiting further implementation of modern technologies both to improve staging and to reduce invasiveness, a full-thickness excision of the rectal wall by TEM still represents the standard treatment even for suspected benign diseases."

We present a case of 44-years-old male admitted to 2nd Department of General Surgery and Oncological Surgery Medical University for treatment of a submucosal gastric tumor detected in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT). Patient presented with no gastrointestinal disorders and the random endoscopy revealed a gastric tumor, but the biopsy of the lesion showed no carcinomas' cells and the suspicion of GIST. CT confirms the presence of the 5 cm large gastric tumor and intraabdominal lymphadenopathy. The patient was directed to surgery because of the malignant risk. The subtotal gastrectomy with BII anastomosis was performed and no perioperative complications were observed. The postoperative histopathological examination revealed a typical morphology and immunophenotype of tumor. The neoplastic cells were immunoreactive with S-100 protein, but lacked immunoreactivity with CD 117, CD 34 and smooth-muscle actin (SMA). The histopathologic features and immunohistochemical staining pattern were consistent with a gastric schwannoma. The lymph nodes resected, during the operation revealed reactive inflammatory changes without evidence of neoplastic cells and any malignancy. 10-month after the surgery patient has no complains but the follow up will be continued.

CD009944,0,24379641,0,DOG1 is useful for diagnosis of KIT-negative gastrointestinal stromal tumor of stomach.,"Approximately 80%-95% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) show positive staining for KIT, while the other 5%-20% show negative staining. If the tumor is negative for KIT, but is positive for CD34, a histological diagnosis is possible. However, if the tumor is negative for KIT, CD34, S-100, and SMA, a definitive diagnosis is often challenging. Recently, Discovered on GIST-1 (DOG1) has received considerable attention as a useful molecule for the diagnosis of GIST. DOG1, a membrane channel protein, is known to be overexpressed in GIST. Because the sensitivity and specificity of DOG1 are higher than those of KIT, positive staining for DOG1 has been reported, even in KIT-negative GISTs. KIT-negative GISTs most commonly arise in the stomach and are mainly characterized by epithelioid features histologically. We describe our experience with a rare case of a KIT-negative GIST of the stomach that was diagnosed by positive immunohistochemical staining for DOG1 in a patient who presented with severe anemia. Our findings suggest that immunohistochemical staining for DOG1, in addition to gene analysis, is useful for the diagnosis of KIT-negative tumors that are suspected to be GISTs."

Subepithelial tumors (SETs) in the stomach are usually considered benign. However, some do have potential for malignant transformation, especially when originating in the muscularis propria (MP). Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric SETs originating in MP. MATERIAL AND METHODS. A total of 145 gastric MP SETs in 144 patients were treated by ESD between September 2008 and December 2012. Characteristics of patients and SETs, therapeutic outcomes, pathologic characteristics, complications and follow-up outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS. Among the 144 patients, 104 were female (72.22%) and 40 were male (27.78%), and the mean age was 55.75 ± 11.29 years (range 18-78 years). The mean size of the tumors determined by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was 15.14 ± 9.70 mm (range 3-50 mm). En bloc complete resection was achieved in 134 of 145 tumors, giving a complete resection rate of 92.41%. The final histopathologic diagnoses included 52 leiomyomas, 89 gastrointestinal stromal tumors, 3 neurogenic tumors and 1 lipoma. Perforations occurred in 21 patients (14.48%) and were endoscopically repaired with clips or nylon bands. Intraoperative bleeding occurred in seven patients (4.83%) and was corrected with argon plasma coagulation (APC) or hot biopsy forceps. No local recurrence or distant metastasis was detected during a mean follow-up of 19.14 ± 10.29 months (range 3-51 months). CONCLUSIONS.

CD009944,0,24108557,0,Beyond the GIST: mesenchymal tumors of the stomach.,"Intramural gastric masses arise in the wall of the stomach (generally within the submucosa or muscularis propria), often with intact overlying mucosa. These tumors are typically mesenchymal in origin and have overlapping radiologic appearances. A combination of features such as location, attenuation, enhancement, and growth pattern may suggest one diagnosis over another. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) account for the majority of intramural tumors and can vary widely in appearance, from small intraluminal lesions to exophytic masses that protrude into the peritoneal cavity, commonly with areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. A well-circumscribed mass measuring -70 to -120 HU is a lipoma. Leiomyomas usually manifest as low-attenuation masses at the gastric cardia. Homogeneous attenuation is a noteworthy characteristic of schwannomas, particularly for larger lesions that might otherwise be mistaken for GISTs. A hypervascular mass in the antrum is a common manifestation of glomus tumors. Hemangiomas are also hypervascular but often manifest in childhood. Inflammatory fibroid polyps usually arise as a polypoid mass in the antrum. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors are infiltrative neoplasms with a propensity for local recurrence. Plexiform fibromyxomas are rare, usually antral tumors. Carcinoid tumors are epithelial in origin, but often submucosal in location, and therefore should be distinguished from other intramural lesions. Multiple carcinoid tumors are associated with hypergastrinemia, either in the setting of chronic atrophic gastritis or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Sporadic solitary carcinoid tumors not associated with hypergastrinemia have a higher rate of metastasis. Histopathologic analysis, including immunohistochemistry, is usually required for diagnosis of intramural masses."
CD009944,0,24078995,0,Gastric heterotopic pancreas can be identified by endoscopic direct imaging with submucosal endoscopy.,"Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is pancreatic tissue found outside the usual anatomical location of the pancreas, typically in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Asymptomatic HP is considered a benign submucosal tumor (SMT) that can be followed without intervention. However, invasive surgery or endoscopic resection is often inappropriately applied in cases of HP due to the difficulty of preoperative diagnosis by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and tissue sampling error. Therefore, it is very important to distinguish HP from neoplastic SMTs, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), preoperatively. Herein, we describe two asymptomatic gastric HP cases that were distinguished by endoscopic direct imaging (EDI) on submucosal endoscopy with a mucosal flap method (SEMF). In the two patients, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy failed to accurately diagnose two SMTs, consistent with the suspicion of a GIST on EUS. Accordingly, we attempted to perform bloc biopsy using SEMF as a novel method for obtaining tissue samples for two indefinite SMTs. Direct endoscopic imaging via a dissected submucosal tunnel revealed a yellowish, multi-nodular mass identified as pancreatic tissue. Histopathology of the bloc biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of HP. Our findings indicate that the characteristic EDI findings of gastric HP may distinguish these lesions from neoplastic SMTs. Additional evaluations of this approach are warranted."

Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is the non-invasive precursor of pancreatic cancer and gastritis cystica profunda (GCP) is considered a precursor of gastric cancer. As with most putative cancer precursor lesions, the diagnosis and treatment of these lesions has been controversial. A patient with no history of gastric surgery visited our institution for a regular evaluation. Endoscopy showed a 2 x 2 cm sized, protruding mass lesion with overlying normal mucosa on the fundus of stomach. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and computed tomography (CT) led to the possible diagnosis of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor with cystic change. Laparoscopic gastric wedge resection was performed with intra-operative endoscopic guidance. Microscopic examination identified the mass as pancreatic tissue. Furthermore, it demonstrated PanIN, grade 3 (PanIN-3) mixed pancreatobiliary and intestinal type, arising in the heterotopic pancreas and associated with GCP.

However, this tool is underused in evaluating rectal and perirectal lesions, possibly due to insufficient experience and underrecognized value of this procedure. In this study, we report our institutional experience with EUS-FNA as a diagnostic and staging tool for rectal and perirectal lesions. A retrospective chart review was performed and a cohort of 38 patients who underwent rectal EUS-FNA (41 specimens) at our institution between January 2002 and July 2012 was retrieved. The cytology diagnoses were compared with the concurrent or follow-up histologic and clinical diagnoses. Among the total 41 cases, rectal EUS-FNA was performed as a diagnostic procedure in 22 (54%) and a staging procedure in 19 (46%) cases. On cytology examination, 18 cases (44%) were diagnosed as malignant; 1 (2%), as atypical/suspicious for malignancy; 3 (7%), as benign neoplastic; 13 (32%), as nonneoplastic; and 6 (15%), as nondiagnostic cases. Concurrent or follow-up histologic diagnoses were available in 20 cases (48%), 19 of them had concordant cytological/histologic findings (10 benign, 9 malignant). One perirectal lymph node with negative cytology diagnosis was found to be positive on histologic examination, probably due to sampling error on cytology. The sensitivity and specificity of EUS-FNA for detecting malignant rectal/perirectal lesions in this study were 91% and 100%, respectively. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration is a useful diagnostic tool for rectal/perirectal lesions; it confirms or excludes malignancy for lesions with high or low clinical suspicions. It serves as a reliable staging method to identify patients for proper clinical management."

CD009944,0,24009205,0,Endoscopic ultrasonographic features of gastric linitis plastica in fifty-five Chinese patients.,"The objective of this study was to investigate the endosonographic appearance of gastric linitis plastica (GLP) and to study the usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for the T and N staging of GLP. EUS examinations of 55 patients with histologically proven GLP were retrospectively studied. In all patients, EUS showed that lesions involved at least one-third of the circumference of the stomach. Based on the findings of the EUS, the 55 patients were divided into two groups. There were 32 (58.2%) patients in the first group. EUS of this group showed that the five sonographic layers had disappeared and had been replaced by a hypoechogenic thickening of the gastric wall. There were 23 (41.8%) patients in the second group. EUS of this group showed that the first three sonographic layers were blurred and thickened, and the fourth layer was significantly thickened. The full thickness of the gastric wall was significantly thicker in first than in the second group of patients (P<0.01). The incidence of perigastric lesions was significantly higher in the first than in the second group of patients (P<0.01). Results for the 15 patients following preoperative EUS were compared postoperatively with histopathologic findings for T and N staging. The overall diagnostic accuracy of the T stage was 73.3% and of the N stage was 60.0%. In eight patients, we used EUS to assess a therapeutic response. No response was observed in five patients and a partial response in three. EUS images of GLP are characteristic. EUS is helpful in diagnosing GLP and for assessing the T and N stages."
CD009944,0,23998446,0,"Gastroesophageal cancer: focus on epidemiology, classification, and staging.","Gastroesophageal cancer (GEC), comprising proximal esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and distal gastric cancer (GC), is a significant public health concern. The epidemiology of these tumors has significantly changed over the past several decades especially in developed countries. There is a recognized decrease in incidence and mortality of distal GC and an increase in incidence and mortality of proximal EGJ cancer. The changing epidemiology is thought to be mainly due to changing trends of risk factors such as lower incidence of Helicobacter pylori infection and increasing incidence of obesity and gastroesophageal reflux. Histologically, EGJ cancers are adenocarcinoma (AC), while distal esophagus may be squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or AC. Distal GC is predominantly AC. Following anatomical and histological distinction, tumors are staged with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), computerized tomography (CT), and often positron emission tomography (PET) with or without diagnostic laparoscopic and peritoneal washing. Accurate staging of tumors, with emphasis on excluding occult metastasis, is imperative to avoid unnecessary surgical resection. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how these tumors are classified, the associated epidemiology, and the current standards of staging prior to selecting the appropriate course of therapy. In this review we will discuss the epidemiology, classification, and staging of locally advanced GEC."

CD009944,0,23910174,0,Primary synovial sarcoma of the stomach--a case report and review of the literature.,"Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a mesenchymal spindle cell tumor which displays variable epithelial differentiation. It commonly arises around the major joints or tendon sheaths in young adults, but is not commonly seen in the stomach. We experienced a case of primary gastric SS. The patient is a 22-year-old male, who presented with epigastric pain. Upper endoscopy showed an ulcer of 25 mm in diameter with marginal elevation on the posterior mid-gastric body. Biopsy of the ulcer base showed monotonous proliferation of small spindle-shaped cells on HE-stain. On immunohistochemical staining, these cells were positively stained with vimentin, cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and CD99, but were negative for KIT, CD34, desmin, and S-100 protein. These findings were compatible with SS of monophasic type. Diagnosis of primary gastric SS was made because there were no other primary lesions, nor metastatic lesions. The wedge resection was performed. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using the RNA from frozen neoplastic tissue of the resected specimen, detected a fusion gene called SYT-SSX1, specific for SS. Though SS arising in the stomach is rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of KIT-negative gastric spindle cell tumor."
CD009944,0,23902569,0,Submucosal tumors: comprehensive guide for the diagnosis and therapy of gastrointestinal submucosal tumors.,"Small submucosal tumors (SMT) without symptoms are frequently found by endoscopic and radiological examinations. To find proper diagnostic measures and therapeutic indications for histologically undiagnosed SMT, we reviewed published articles in PubMed between 1990 and March 2013 using the key words 'submucosal tumor' and the name of a specific disease. SMT is observed in a wide range of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and conditions, including compression by extra-GI organs and lesions, congenital tumors, inflammation, and benign as well as malignant neoplastic lesions. In the diagnosis of diseases and decision-making for therapy, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) may play a key role. Symptomatic SMT and SMT histologically diagnosed as malignant or potentially malignant tumors such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) should be treated by surgery. SMT >5 cm, SMT increasing in size and those with'high-risk features' including irregular border, heterogeneous internal echo such as anechoic area, and heterogeneous enhancement by contrast media may also be removed by surgery. Laparoscopic approach is feasible for gastric GIST <5 cm and this is considered less invasive than the open approach. Emerging techniques using flexible endoscopes appear less invasive, but require further evidence and are still under clinical study. Correct diagnosis of SMT is challenging; however, EUS and EUS-FNA are useful in the histological diagnosis and clinical decision-making. In the future, minimally invasive approaches may be a mainstream of surgical treatment for small SMT."

Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to these patients may be complicated, with endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), classically performed by gastroenterologists, playing a very important role. As this disease is not closely related to the ""digestive tract"", gastroenterologists have been forced to update their knowledge on this field o adequately diagnose this significant group of patients. The recent advent of modern and promising techniques like endobronchial ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EBUS-FNA) have prompted new approaches for diagnosis and staging of this type of patients.

Retrospective clinical study was conducted at the Clinic for Hematology and Clinic for Gastroenterology of the University Clinical Center of Sarajevo in the period of years 2002 to 2009. Patients (N = 40) with diagnosis of gastric lymphoma confirmed by pathohistological diagnosis were included in the study. Stage of the disease was determined based on EUS, proximal endoscopy, CT and ultrasound of abdomen, and classified according to the Ann Arbor classification. 39 patients had various types of non Hodgkin lymphoma and one patient had Hodgkin lymphoma. Based on morphological characteristics of gastric tumor visualized with EUS in 16 patients a gastric cancer was suspected. In 40% patients EUS finding was not confirmed by pathohistological finding. Compared both to CT and ultrasound of abdomen, EUS showed statistically significant higher frequency of establishing existence of infiltration (p < 0.001). In patients with primary gastric lymphoma EUS has more significant role in determination of stage of disease spread than for the diagnosis itself. Therefore EUS should be included into algorithm of patient diagnostic protocol when suspected to the malignant gastric disease."

A biopsy of the esophageal mass was performed and the pathologic findings with immunohistochemical stain for Mucin-5AC are proved to be identical to that of gastric adenocarcinoma, suggesting metastasis from main lesion of the gastric cancer. The lesion could not be explained by lymphatic or hematogenous spread, and its metastasis mechanism is considered to be different from previous studies. We suggest that the gastroesophageal reflux of cancer cells could be one of the possible metastatic pathways for metastasis of esophagus from an adenocarcinoma of the stomach."

CD009944,0,23722535,0,"Gastric carcinoma: imaging diagnosis, staging and assessment of treatment response.","Gastric carcinoma (GC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Surgical resection is the only cure available and is dependent on the GC stage at presentation, which incorporates depth of tumor invasion, extent of lymph node and distant metastases. Accurate preoperative staging is therefore essential for optimal surgical management with consideration of preoperative and/or postoperative chemotherapy. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) with its ability to assess tumor depth, nodal disease and metastases is the preferred technique for staging GC. Endoscopic ultrasonography is more accurate for assessing the depth of wall invasion in early cancer, but is limited in the assessment of advanced local or stenotic cancer and detection of distant metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although useful for staging, is not proven to be effective. Positron emission tomography (PET) is most useful for detecting and characterizing distant metastases. Both MDCT and PET are useful for assessment of treatment response following preoperative chemotherapy and for detection of recurrence after surgical resection. This review article discusses the usefulness of imaging modalities for detecting, staging and assessing treatment response for GC and the potential role of newer applications including CT volumetry, virtual gastroscopy and perfusion CT in the management of GC."

CD009944,0,23617646,0,Lessons from imperfect endoscopic submucosal dissection of rectal tumor.,"Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a standard endoscopic treatment for gastrointestinal tumors, but resections done in a piecemeal fashion are difficult to diagnose pathologically as curative resections, and the local recurrence rate is relatively high. Recently, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for colorectal tumors, which provides a higher complete resection rate than conventional EMR, has rapidly come into widespread use in Japan. However, colorectal ESD is still technically difficult and has complications such as perforation, and the procedure time is longer than that of conventional EMR. We report herein a case in which a rectal tumor was resected with an inappropriate specimen due to imperfect ESD. This lesion had severe fibrosis in the submucosal layer because the lesion had been injected with a solution for EMR in another hospital, which resulted in non-lifting signs, and had been subjected to many biopsies. During the ESD in our hospital, the submucosal layer was not clearly identified, and a small injury was caused in the specimen. A precise diagnosis based on histopathological findings could not be made because of the inappropriate specimen. Thus, expertise in both the diagnostic and the therapeutic aspects is required before treating large colorectal tumors."
CD009944,0,23613938,0,Noninvasive visualization of microRNA-16 in the chemoresistance of gastric cancer using a dual reporter gene imaging system.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated to play a central role in the development of drug resistance in a variety of malignancies. However, many studies were conducted at the in vitro level and could not provide the in vivo information on the functions of miRNAs in the anticancer drug resistance. Here, we introduced a dual reporter gene imaging system for noninvasively monitoring the kinetic expression of miRNA-16 during chemoresistance in gastric cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) and firefly luciferase (Fluc) genes were linked to form hNIS/Fluc double fusion reporter gene and then generate human gastric cancer cell line NF-3xmir16 and its multidrug resistance cell line NF-3xmir16/VCR. Radioiodide uptake and Fluc luminescence signals in vitro correlated well with viable cell numbers. The luciferase activities and radioiodide uptake in NF-3xmir16 cells were remarkably repressed by exogenous or endogenous miRNA-16. The NF-3xmir16/VCR cells showed a significant increase of (131)I uptake and luminescence intensity compared to NF-3xmir16 cells. The radioactivity from in vivo (99m)Tc-pertechnetate imaging and the intensity from bioluminescence imaging were also increased in NF-3xmir16/VCR compared with that in NF-3xmir16 tumor xenografts. Furthermore, using this reporter gene system, we found that etoposide (VP-16) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) activated miRNA-16 expression in vitro and in vivo, and the upregulation of miRNA-16 is p38MAPK dependent but NF-κB independent. This dual imaging reporter gene may be served as a novel tool for in vivo imaging of microRNAs in the chemoresistance of cancers, as well as for early detection and diagnosis in clinic."

With the development of endoscopic resection and multimodal treatment concepts, pretherapeutic tumor staging has gained in importance. However, the accuracy of present imaging modalities is still limited with a tendency towards overstaging of locally advanced tumors. Extended lymph node dissection cannot be recommended in cases with advanced lymph node involvement. In cardiac cancer retroperitoneal lymphatic spread to the left renal vein is an early event and should thus not be classified as stage IV disease. In cases of intra-abdominal gastrectomy a pouch reconstruction should be considered in cases with a good overall prognosis. Subgroup analyses indicate a differential therapeutic effect of the established perioperative chemotherapy depending on the location of the primary tumor. There is also good evidence for an additional beneficial effect of radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy."

The term inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor more commonly referred to as ""pseudostumor "", denotes a pseudosarcomatous inflammatory lesion that contains spindle cells, myofibroblasts, plasma cells, lymphocytes and histiocytes. It exhibits a variable biological behavior that ranges from frequently benign lesions to more aggressive variants. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor mostly occurs in the soft tissue of children and young adults, and the lungs are the most commonly affected site, but it has been recognized that any anatomic localization can be involved.

We herein reported a case of primary HS of the stomach which was confirmed through histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical staining. A 52-year-old woman presented with progressive difficulty in feeding and dull pain in the epigastric region. Gastroscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, double contrast examination, and computed tomography revealed a mass located on the posterior wall of fundus and lesser curvature of the stomach. Microscopically, the cytoplasm of the tumor cells was abundant and eosinophilic. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the tumor cells were positive for CD45RO and CD68. It is difficult to differentiate HS of stomach from other gastric malignancies by radiological evaluation alone. However, HS may be considered when a protruding and ulcerated mass in stomach shows heterogeneous hypervascular features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in English language literature that emphasizes the imaging findings of human gastric HS."

Our aim is to present two cases of large anorectal GIST treated with local excision through a new anterolateral trans-sphincteric approach followed by adjuvant therapy with imatinib. Two patients (both males, 68 and 63 years old) presented at our institution with anorectal GIST in the period October-November 2010. Their medical records, pathology results, and imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed. Both patients presented with an anterior perianal mass. Imaging studies were characteristic of GIST originating in the lower rectum, circumscribed by a pseudocapsule, and protruding into the ischiorectal fossa. Both patients underwent local excision via an anterolateral trans-sphincteric approach. Both tumors were removed intact, with microscopically negative margins. The maximum tumor diameter was 8 and 9 cm, and the diagnosis of GIST was confirmed by positive CD117 and CD34 staining in both cases. Both tumors had a high (>5/50HPF) mitotic index. The patients had an uneventful postoperative course and were discharged on days 5 and 6. Both patients were started on imatinib 400 mg bid postoperatively. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography computed tomography were carried out at 12 months and did not reveal any signs of recurrence. The patients are currently disease-free at 24 and 23 months of follow-up. In selected cases, complete excision of rectal GIST with negative margins is feasible via a trans-sphincteric approach. With the use of adjuvant therapy, which is currently advocated in all high-risk cases, it is possible that local excision with its reduced morbidity may become a viable alternative, especially in patients who would otherwise require abdominoperineal excision such as the two presented here. Prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm adequate oncologic results."

The holmium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser has precise tissue cutting ability and good hemostatic properties and has been widely applicated to soft tissue, but the use of endoscopic Ho:YAG laser ablation for early gastrointestinal cancer has not been reported. Twenty patients with biopsy-proven early GI cancer who had a high surgical risk or refused surgery were treated by endoscopic Ho:YAG laser ablation. The tumors of all patients were confined to the mucosal layer without ulceration and without lymph node metastasis. The tumor diameter was not more than 2.5 cm. Endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and computed tomography scan were performed 1-3 months after the treatment, and a biopsy was performed to evaluate the effects of the therapy. Long-term endoscopic follow-up was maintained. Complete eradication was achieved in all the 20 patients, including four patients with high-grade dysplasia associated with focal canceration, seven patients with well-differentiated squamous cell cancer, and nine patients with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, resulting in a complete response rate of 100% at 1-3 months after treatment. No recurrence was found during 36-73 months of follow-up in all 20 patients. No operative or delayed complications were observed in any of the 20 patients. Preliminary study shows that endoscopic Ho:YAG laser ablation may be an effective, safe, and minimally invasive method for selected patients with early GI intramucosal cancer. Further research is required to confirm the safety and efficacy of this technique compared to its alternative techniques in a multicenter randomized controlled trial."

This study aims to assess the capability of Raman spectroscopy for multi-class elucidation of intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis sequence in vivo for improving precancer detection at endoscopy. We employ a novel image-guided Raman endoscopy technique developed for in vivo gastric tissue Raman measurement within 0.5 s during clinical endoscopic examination. We have acquired a total of 1277 in vivo Raman spectra from 83 gastric patients associated with intestinal-type carcinogenesis. In vivo Raman spectroscopy integrated with semi-quantitative spectral modelling (e.g. DNA, lipids, glycoprotein, proteins and blood) reveals the progressive changes of biochemical constituents in gastric tissue associated with preneoplastic and neoplastic transformation (i.e., IM, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma). Multi-class probabilistic partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) diagnostic algorithms based on in vivo Raman spectra are able to identify normal mucosa with sensitivity of 75.88% and specificity of 87.21%; IM with sensitivity of 46.67% and specificity of 87.55%; dysplasia with sensitivity of 83.33%; specificity of 95.80%, and adenocarcinoma with sensitivity of 84.91% and specificity 95.57%, respectively. This work demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive biomolecular probe for monitoring intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis to realize early diagnosis and detection of precancer and early gastric cancer in vivo during clinical endoscopic examination."

In this case series, we aimed to analyze the EUS and CT characteristics of gastric glomus tumors. Seven patients with gastric glomus tumors were retrospectively enrolled in this study. EUS showed that all the tumors were located in the fourth EUS layer (muscularis propria) and had distinct borders. The tumors had a heterogeneous appearance with either hypo- or hyperechogenicity, and all the tumors except one had the characteristic peripheral halo around them. On CT scans,all the tumors appeared as well-defined SMT with a clear margin and showed the same characteristics in the different phases of CT. During dynamic contrast-enhanced CT, the tumors showed strong enhancement in the arterial phase and prolonged enhancement in the delayed phase. This case series shows the characteristic EUS findings and the distinguishing features of CT scans for gastric glomus tumors; these findings will help in differentiating gastric glomus tumors from other SMT."

Between 1996 and 2009, 1390 patients underwent surgery for esophageal cancer in our institution, and 209 were found to have clinical T1N0 disease. Exclusion criteria were nonsquamous carcinoma, double primary cancer, definite distant metastasis, administration of neoadjuvant treatment, and incomplete abdominal lymph node dissection. We retrospectively analyzed medical records, operative and pathologic data, and follow-up information. Forty-two patients were excluded from the study. Among the 167 enrolled patients, preoperative endoscopic ultrasound evaluation was performed in 160 patients. Fifty-two patients had distal esophageal or esophagogastric junction tumor. Surgery included 2 cases of tri-incisional esophagectomy, 17 cases of transhiatal esophagectomy, and 148 cases of two-field esophagectomy (Ivor Lewis operation). Common hepatic artery lymph node dissection was performed in all cases, and none of the patients had metastasis. Mean follow-up period was 35.4 ± 28.7 months. In-hospital mortality was one, and 5-year survival rate was 80.6%. Among the 15 patients with recurrence, there were two distant metastases and five distant and local recurrences but no intra-abdominal recurrence with common hepatic artery lymph node. Common hepatic artery lymph node dissection may be safely omitted in surgery for clinical T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma when preoperative evaluations including chest computed tomography, positron emission tomography and computed tomography, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy or endoscopic ultrasound are performed."

Diagnosis of the anatomical extent of gallbladder carcinoma was compared with histologic analysis, and staging accuracy was evaluated according to the TNM classification. Carcinoma considered to be at an early stage with no lymph node metastasis was correctly diagnosed in 87.5%. Differential diagnosis between early and advanced staged tumors was possible in 79.5%. Overall accuracy for depth of tumor invasion (T) was 76.9%. Limitations were due to many stones in the gallbladder and microinfiltration of carcinoma. Assessment of regional lymph node metastasis (N) was at a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 92.9%, for an overall accuracy of 89.7%. We believe endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in the clinical staging of gallbladder carcinoma."
CD009944,0,11979247,0,Interobserver agreement in staging gastric malt lymphoma by EUS.,"EUS is highly accurate for staging gastric lymphoma.

CD009944,0,8365597,0,Delineation of the gastric muscularis mucosae and assessment of depth of invasion of early gastric cancer using a 20-megahertz endoscopic ultrasound probe.,"Using a 20 MHz endoscopic ultrasound system, delineation of the gastric muscularis mucosae and estimation of the depth of malignant invasion was attempted by in vivo scanning during the process of routine endoscopic observation or in vitro scanning of excised sections of 34 early gastric cancers in 32 patients. The muscularis mucosae was visualized as a single hypoechoic layer in 16 of 32 lesions (50%) scanned in vitro. Comparison of lesions in which delineation of the muscularis mucosae was or was not possible revealed no significant differences with respect to either the thickness of the lamina propria and muscularis mucosae or with respect to the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration of the lamina propria or the conditions of the boundary between the lamina propria and the muscularis mucosae. This indicates that improvement of the operability characteristics of the ultrasonic apparatus will be needed to achieve improved delineation of the muscularis mucosae. The accuracy of invasion depth estimation of early gastric cancer was 67% (16 of 24 lesions scanned in vivo) and 73% (8 of 11 lesions) in cases in vivo where the muscularis mucosae and the tumor were delineated on the same screen. The principal factors causing erroneous staging were the presence of dilated benign glandular ducts, ulcer scars, and attenuation of the ultrasound waves."

CD009944,0,8514069,0,Carcinoid tumors of the gastrointestinal tract: evaluation with endoscopic ultrasonography.,"To evaluate the usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonography for carcinoid tumors, we examined 29 patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors (5 gastric, 7 duodenal, and 17 rectal). The smallest size detectable by endoscopic ultrasonography was 2 mm in diameter histologically. The cross-sectional image of the tumors was primarily oval to round. The internal echo was generally hypoechoic and homogeneous. The margins were clearly visualized, and the contour was somewhat smooth. The tumors were mainly located in the third layer. The second layer covered the tumor with the third layer at its base, and it abutted the tumor and became indistinct near its upper interface. These findings were especially recognized in lesions with submucosal invasion and were similar at all sites. The overall accuracy of determining the depth of invasion using endoscopic ultrasonography was 75% (27 of 36 lesions). Limited to the lesions detectable by endoscopic ultrasonography, the accuracy was 90%. Endoscopic ultrasonography was useful in determining the presence of local metastases. Moreover, endoscopic ultrasonography allowed direct detection of perigastrointestinal lymph node metastases (75%, three of four patients). In conclusion, endoscopic ultrasonography was found to be useful for the staging of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors by determining depth of involvement and presence of perigastrointestinal lymph node metastases."

CD009944,0,8929802,0,The TNM staging system.,"The new TNM staging system for cancer has great importance because of its applicability for imaging techniques, particularly clinical staging by EUS. The close correlation between clinical (EUS) and pathologic staging permits clinicians to define the strategy for treatment based on the stage of the cancer. In cases where lymph node metastasis is suspected, EUS-guided FNA can be performed for confirmation of this diagnosis by cytology. In the era of minimally invasive surgery, EUS will become the most important diagnostic modality for defining early stage malignant disease. In such cases endoscopic or surgical resection can be performed. When a tumor is shown by EUS to be nonresectable, it will become important to avoid explorative surgery. Despite some limitations, both the TNM classification and EUS clinical staging will be used with increasing frequency in the clinical management of patients with cancer. Furthermore, refinements in the TNM staging system, such as adoption of subclassifications of early cancers and clarification of the definition of regional lymph node involvement, will be necessary to optimize clinical staging. Technologic improvement of EUS instruments, particularly in miniaturization of the echoprobe, will improve the integration of EUS as a routine procedure for cancer staging."
CD009944,0,7859967,0,Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration.,"Thirty-eight consecutive patients underwent endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Of 46 lesions, 34 were extraluminal (12 pancreatic masses, 8 periesophageal nodes, 6 celiac nodes, 2 pericolonic masses, 1 mediastinal mass, 1 perigastric mass, 1 liver, 1 periduodenal node, 1 perirectal mass, 1 perirectal node) and 12 were submucosal (8 gastric, 3 duodenal, 1 esophageal). One hundred sixty-three passes were made, with an average of 3.5 passes per lesion and 4.3 passes per patient (range, 1 to 8). Adequate specimens were obtained from 91% of targeted lesions. The overall diagnostic accuracy was 87%. In patients with malignant lesions, sensitivity was 91% and specificity 100%. Celiac nodes were successfully sampled and diagnostic in 5 of 6 (83%) patients. No complications occurred. Using this technique, an initial tissue diagnosis of malignancy was made in 66% of cancer patients without a previous diagnosis and the preoperative stage was changed in 44% of cancer patients. The additional information gained by this modality directly influenced the decision not to perform surgery in 26% of patients with a primary malignancy. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is feasible and can be safely used to evaluate submucosal and extraluminal lesions in both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract with a high degree of diagnostic accuracy."

CD009944,0,1473669,0,Evaluation of endoscopic ultrasonography in the pre-operative staging of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater and common bile duct.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed in 23 patients with carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (ampulla) and in 16 patients with common bile duct (CBD) carcinoma. These patients all underwent surgery. The layered structures of the duodenum, ampulla, and CBD, and the pancreas, portal vein, and regional lymph nodes were clearly identified by EUS using a transduodenal approach. With this technique, ampullary carcinoma appeared as a hypoechoic mass in 22 of 23 patients, and the 1 remaining cancer was not detected because of its small size. Carcinoma of the CBD also appeared as a hypoechoic mass in 12 of 16 patients. However, the remaining four appeared as hyperechoic masses. For these tumors, EUS had a high tumor detection rate (96 to 100%). In this regard, EUS was comparable to ERCP and was better than ultrasonography (US), CT, and angiography. Using EUS, we were also able to stage the extent of these tumors according to the involvement of the duodenal or CBD walls, invasion of the pancreas and portal vein, and spread to regional lymph nodes. The accuracy rates of cancer extent by EUS were 78% for ampullary carcinoma and 81% for CBD carcinoma when compared with surgical findings. We conclude that EUS is a valuable method for the detection and staging of tumors of the ampulla and CBD."

CD009944,0,1511822,1,"Local staging and assessment of resectability in carcinoma of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum by endoscopic ultrasonography.","Eighty-eight patients with carcinoma of the esophagus (N = 44), stomach (N = 41), and duodenum (N = 3) who underwent surgery were pre-operatively examined by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). The ability of EUS to accurately predict the T stage and the N stage was 82% and 70% for esophageal carcinoma, 71% and 75% for gastric cancer, and 100% and 66% for duodenal malignancy. In esophageal carcinoma, the accuracy of T staging was only slightly lower in cases with non-traversable tumor stenoses (77%) compared with traversable carcinomas (84%). This was probably due to the fact that all non-traversable tumors were either in stage T3 or T4. The accuracy of EUS in predicting the stages T1 to T3, which correspond to R0 resectability (no macroscopic or microscopic tumor remains), was 92% for adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and 85% for gastric cancer. However, in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, R0 resection was possible in only 66% of all cases, whereas EUS predicted an 84% R0 resection rate. In adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and stomach, EUS prediction of stages T1 to T3 correlated well with the actual rate of R0 resection. These results show that EUS is a reliable diagnostic method for the local staging of upper gastrointestinal cancer. Its impact on treatment and hence on prognosis of patients with these malignancies has yet to be determined."
CD009944,0,8365600,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer invasion.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography was pre-operatively performed in 164 patients with colorectal cancer, and the resected specimens confirmed to be cancerous histologically. Normal colorectal wall was visualized by endoscopic ultrasonography as a five-layered structure. The first, third, and fifth layers were hyperechoic, and the second and fourth layers were hypoechoic. The first and second layers comprised the mucosa, the third layer the submucosa, the fourth layer the muscularis propria, and the fifth layer the subserosa and serosa (adventitia). By this technique, cancer of the colon appeared as a hypoechoic mass with an intermediate echo level between the third hyperechoic and fourth hypoechoic layers. Endoscopic ultrasonographic determination of the depth of tumor invasion was based on abnormal changes of these layered structures and adjacent organs. Overall, the accuracy rate of endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of the depth of colorectal cancer was 83%. A hypoechoic round mass adjacent to the cancer was interpreted as a metastatic lymph node. The sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis were 68% and 70%, respectively. The overall accuracy rate of tumor staging by endoscopic ultrasonography according to Dukes' classification was 62%. Endoscopic ultrasonography is a valuable tool in the management of colorectal cancer. It has a high accuracy rate in determining the depth of tumor invasion. The pre-operative information obtained with this tool may influence the choice of therapy."

Differentiation of early gastric cancers from advanced cancers has been emphasized, with the concordance rate of the ultrasonographic interpretation and the pathology exceeding 90%. When pre-operative staging by the TNM system was attempted, results were similar to the reports from the West, with overall concordance rate for tumor depth of greater than 80%.

CD009944,0,7672544,0,Malignant esophageal strictures: staging accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography.,"The prognosis for patients with carcinoma of the esophagus remains poor despite aggressive combination therapies and radical surgical resections. Accuracy of staging esophageal carcinoma by endoscopic ultrasonography is unmatched by that of any other modality. Of patients with esophageal carcinoma, 20% to 36% present with high-grade malignant strictures that preclude passage of the echoendoscope. Aggressive wire-guided dilation followed by complete endoscopic ultrasonographic assessment or endosonography limited to the proximal aspect of the stricture has been used in staging these patients. Of 204 patients with esophageal carcinoma, 51 (25%) presented with high-grade malignant strictures, defined as stenosis precluding passage of the echoendoscope without prior dilation. Thirty-nine of the 51 patients were treated by esophageal resection. Twenty-one of these patients underwent preoperative staging using wire-guided dilation followed by endoscopic ultrasonography, whereas 18 underwent limited endosonographic staging. Correct preoperative assessment of depth of tumor invasion (T stage) was obtained in 33% (7 of 21) of the former group and 28% (5 of 18) of the latter group. Advanced tumor stage (stage III or IV) was present in 90% (35 of 39) of patients presenting with high-grade strictures, indicating a poor prognosis for those patients. The current study demonstrates that (1) approximately 25% of all patients with esophageal carcinoma present with high-grade stricutres that preclude passage of the echoendoscope without prior dilation, (2) the majority of patients with high-grade malignant strictures present with advanced disease (stage III or IV), and (3) because of the low accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography in staging high-grade strictures, the need to subject such patients to invasive staging studies is questionable."

Curative surgery should only be attempted in patients with limited extent of their disease, patients with locally advanced disease should be allocated for neo-adjuvant therapy, while the remaining patients should be referred for palliative measures following a quick, lenient and correct pretherapeutic evaluation. This thorough evaluation and subsequent treatment assignment is also valuable in the identification of uniform patient cohorts for new treatment protocols as well as for the continuing comparison of research data. But despite the importance of accurate pretherapeutic assessment being repeatedly emphasized insufficient staging has been - and is still accepted as - leading to high rates of explorative surgery as well as heterogeneous selection of patients for new treatment trials. Based on the results from the authors PhD thesis he concluded that endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) as a single imaging modality provided detailed information that hitherto had been inaccessible. EUS was considered a significant progress regarding the loco-regional assessment of stage and resectability, but it was also evident that EUS alone was incapable of providing all the necessary information. In addition, there were no evidence regarding the EUS safety profile, patient tolerance of the procedure and no data on the clinical impact of both EUS and EUS guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) in UGIC patients. Therefore, the author chose to conduct additional EUS trials and to test the use of EUS-FNA, laparoscopy (LAP), laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) and LUS guided biopsy in order to improve the overall pretherapeutic evaluation and thus the patient selection. The aim of this thesis was to describe the sequential development, testing and clinical results of a new pretherapeutic evaluation strategy based on EUS and LUS."

Stomach layer has a 5-layer structure. Gastric cancer is visualized as low echoic tumor image by EUS. Massive invasion of gastric cancer is viewed as low echoic and clear boundary image. Diffuse invasion is imaged unclear boundary echo and visualized thick layer with remaining layer structure. Invasion depth of gastric cancer by EUS is diagnosed according to level of wall destruction. When depressed type cancer has ulceration in cancer nest, echoic image is modified with fibrous tissue. The diagnostic criteria of depressed type cancer classified into EUS imaging of cancer in consideration for image modified by fibrous tissue accompanied ulceration."

After histologic diagnosis by endosonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy, he underwent a total gastrectomy. Histologic examination of the resected specimen revealed a tumor 20mm in diameter consisting of well-to-moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the thickened wall of the gastric greater curvature, which contained small cystic lesions in the lamina propria. Immunohistochemical staining showed thick gastric wall consisting of not only multiple cysts but also smooth muscle, elastic and collagen fibers. The histologic diagnosis was advanced gastric cancer accompanied by diffuse cystic malformation (DCM). Although it is a rare condition, DCM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of giant gastric folds and as a pre-cancerous lesion."

CD009944,0,23065169,0,Ovarian carcinomatosis: how the radiologist can help plan the surgical approach.,"Ovarian carcinoma is the most common cause of death due to gynecologic malignancy. Peritoneal involvement is present in approximately 70% of patients at the time of initial diagnosis. The disease spreads abdominally by direct extension, exfoliation of tumor cells into the peritoneal space, and dissemination of tumor cells along lymphatic pathways. Carcinomatosis characterizes an advanced stage of disease in which peritoneal disease has spread throughout the upper abdomen (stage IIIC) or in which diffuse peritoneal disease is accompanied by malignant pleural infiltration or visceral metastases (stage IV). Common sites of intraperitoneal seeding of ovarian carcinoma include the pelvis, omentum, paracolic gutters, liver capsule, and diaphragm. Soft-tissue thickening, nodularity, and enhancement are all signs of peritoneal involvement. Advanced-stage disease is treated either with initial cytoreductive surgery (debulking) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, or with initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by debulking. Radiologic imaging plays an important role in the selection of patients who may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy before debulking. However, accurate interpretation of the imaging findings is challenging and requires a detailed knowledge of the complex peritoneal anatomy, directionality of flow of peritoneal fluid, and specific disease sites that are likely to present particular difficulties with regard to surgical access and technique. Although there is as yet no clear consensus on the criteria for resectability of peritoneal lesions, extensive involvement of the small bowel or mesenteric root, involved lymph nodes superior to the celiac axis, pleural infiltration, pelvic sidewall invasion, bladder trigone involvement, and hepatic parenchymal metastases or implants near the right hepatic vein are considered indicative of potential nonresectability. Implants larger than 2 cm in diameter in the diaphragm, lesser sac, porta hepatis, intersegmental fissure, gallbladder fossa, or gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic ligament also may represent nonresectable disease."

CD009944,0,23001857,0,Endoscopic ultrasonographic assessment of gastric polyps and endoscopic mucosal resection.,"Gastric polyps refer to a heterogeneous group of epithelial- and subepithelial-based lesions that vary in histology and malignant potential. Although many gastric polyps have characteristic endoscopic appearances, their diagnosis, classification, and potential for malignant transformation are based on histologic evaluation. Therefore, all types of gastric polyps should be biopsied during the incident endoscopy. Mucosal-based polyps include fundic gland polyps, hyperplastic polyps, adenomatous polyps, and hamartomatous polyps. Inflammatory fibroid polyps may endoscopically appear similar to mucosal-based polyps but actually arise from the submucosa. Certain types of polyps are associated with genetic syndromes or potential precancerous conditions (gastric intestinal metaplasia and chronic atrophic gastritis). If dysplasia is present and the polyp is ≥2 cm or symptomatic, the polyp should be endoscopically resected with the aim of en bloc resection. There are limited data on the use of adjunctive endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the evaluation of mucosal-based gastric polyps, and therefore, is not routinely employed in the management of these lesions. EUS is recommended for the evaluation of gastric subepithelial lesions."

Although most of these tumors are considered benign, some have a potential for malignant transformation, particularly those originating from the muscularis propria layer. For this type of tumor, surgical resection is the standard treatment of choice. With recent advent of endoscopic resection techniques and devices, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been considered as an alternative way of treatment.

CD009944,0,22878576,0,[Modern diagnostics and stage-oriented surgery: therapy of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction].,"The basis for decision-making about an individualized surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction is tumor staging and exact evaluation of the topography of the tumor in the small junctional area. The diagnostics mainly comprise endoscopy, biopsy, endosonography, computed tomography and partially diagnostic laparoscopy. This results in a clinical TNM staging and an evaluation according to the AEG classification from oral to aboral in type I (esophagus), type II (cardia) and type III (subcardia). Endoscopic resection is only appropriate for the infrequent mucosal carcinomas whereas the majority of the junctional carcinomas are treated by surgical resection. This is combined with neoadjuvant treatment in case of T3 or resectable T4 carcinomas. A type I carcinoma is removed by radical transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy with high intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy after gastric pull-up. In case of type II or III carcinomas, a transhiatal extended gastrectomy including distal esophageal resection is performed with reconstruction by Roux en Y esophagojejunostomy in the lower mediastinum. However, some advanced type II carcinomas which cannot be resected R0 at the esophagus need esophagectomy and gastric pull-up. This surgical strategy is justified by the topography of the lesion and the corresponding lymphatic drainage. Very rare indications are seen for a limited resection with interposition of small bowel in some mucosal carcinomas or total esophagogastrectomy with colon interposition in very advanced tumors. The neoadjuvant treatment comprises especially chemoradiation for type I and chemotherapy for type II and III carcinomas and leads to a significant survival benefit compared to surgery alone."

Objective is to evaluate the usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonograph (EUS) combined with position emission tomography and computed tomograph (PET-CT) in gastric cancer staging. A total of 124 patients confirmed with gastric cancer were subjected to staging with EUS and PET-CT scanning. The detection rate of primary tumor was 99.2% by combination use of two modalities and 97.6% by EUS alone (p = 0.6219), but the detection rate was 90.3% (112 of 124) by PET-CT alone (compared with the combination, p = 0.0027; compared with EUS alone, p = 0.0299). The locoregional lymph node invasion was identified in 84/124 (67.7%) by combined PET-CT and EUS, which was obviously higher than that with EUS (52.4%) or PET-CT (43.5%) alone (p = 0.0194 and p = 0.0002, respectively). There was no statistical difference in identification of celiac axis lymph node metastasis among three methods, but the combined examination or PET-CT alone was more effective than EUS alone in the detection of distant metastases (all p < 0.01). Furthermore, the combined EUS and PET-CT was more optimal than using EUS or PET-CT alone in the accurate T and N staging and the effect on change of treatment. The present study indicates that the combination of EUS and PET-CT is an ideal modality in the preoperative staging of gastric cancer and it provides beneficial guidance for the treatment of gastric cancer."

We here report a case of a 71-year-old woman with a solitary Peutz-Jeghers type polyp of the stomach who presented with intolerable epigastric pain and weight loss of 5 kg over the prior two months. During the hospital treatment course for this patient, endoscopic examination revealed a bulging lesion with a central hole, mucosal ulceration, an asymmetrical wall thickness and a narrowing of the gastric lumen. A gastric biopsy further revealed ulceration with moderate dysplasia. The patient received endoscopic ultrasonography which showed a second subepithelial lesion that measured 4 cm × 3 cm. Computed tomography of the abdomen subsequently showed a thickened gastric wall with three visibly enlarged lymph nodes, all greater than 1 cm. The suspected diagnosis was malignant gastric cancer with lymph node metastases. The other lesion, which measured 2 cm × 2 cm × 1 cm was noted in the submucosa of the jejunum during surgery.

Between 1991 and 2009, 61 patients with tumors in the GEJ (Siewert type II and III) underwent primary surgical resection. Thirty of 61 patients had type II tumors (49.2%) and 31 had type III tumors (50.8%). The tumor size was larger in type III tumors than type II tumors (P = 0.0026). The overall 5-year survival rates in patients with type II tumors and type III tumors were 44.2 per cent and 41.4 per cent, respectively, with no significant differences (P = 0.1888). The independent survival factors were lower mediastinal lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0323) and a noncurative resection (P = 0.0442). The independent survival factors for patients who underwent curative resections were the tumor size (P = 0.0422), M category (P = 0.0489), and lower mediastinal lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0482). This study showed lower mediastinal lymph node metastasis to be an independent survival factor, and also suggested that lower mediastinal lymph node metastasis was associated with distant metastasis in patients with adenocarcinoma in the GEJ (Siewert type II and III).

In this study, human resected stomach and gastric cancer were investigated using in-line holography and diffraction enhanced imaging at beamline 4W1A of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. It was possible to depict gastric pits, measuring 50-70 µm, gastric grooves and tiny blood vessels in the submucosa layer by SR-PCI. The fine structure of a cancerous ulcer was displayed clearly on imaging the mucosa. The delamination of the gastric wall and infiltration of cancer in the submucosa layer were also demonstrated on cross-sectional imaging. In conclusion, SR-PCI can demonstrate the subtle structures of stomach and gastric cancer that cannot be detected by conventional X-ray absorption imaging, which prompt the X-ray diagnosis of gastric disease to the level of the gastric pit, and has the potential to provide new methods for the imageology of gastric cancer."

Gastric carcinoid type 1 is associated with chronic atrophic gastritis, and because of a low metastatic potential, is the most benign type. Death from metastatic disease has been reported in only three patients in a review including 724 cases. The present report refers to a 60-year-old man who was affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus and pernicious anemia and died from metastatic gastric carcinoid type 1. In 1998, a well-differentiated 1.2 cm gastric neuroendocrine tumor, immunoreactive for chromogranin A, with a Ki-67 index less than 2% and with infiltration to the submucosal layer was diagnosed and enucleated. In 2002, a new well-differentiated gastric endocrine tumor 6 mm in size with a Ki-67 of approximately 2% was detected, and endoscopic ultrasound confirmed it to be limited to the submucosal layer. The patient refused antrectomy and started long-acting somatostatin analog (lanreotide) in 2005 when the Ki-67 index was 7%, but he stopped the treatment after 4 months. In 2007, despite previous endoscopic stability, endoscopic ultrasound showed an infiltrating gastric lesion of 7 cm. At surgery, the disease appeared to be extended to the liver and to the peritoneum (well-differentiated endocrine carcinoma, Ki-67 40%) with both hepatic and massive peritoneal metastases. A regimen of somatostatin analog was soon restarted; however, the disease continued to spread, and the patient died 6 months later. Overall, despite their generally benign course, type 1 gastric carcinoids may have malignant potential, a finding that should be considered when planning the medical workup of these patients."

A 49-year-old man using PPI for the last 15 years due to gastroesophageal reflux disease developed progressive dysphagia, dyspepsia and weight loss. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography and abdominal CT diagnosed a malignant tumor localized to a hiatal hernia. Fasting serum chromogranin A and gastrin concentrations were elevated (32 nmol/l and 159 pmol/l, respectively). Helicobacter pylori PCR analysis of antral biopsies was negative. Biopsies from endoscopically normal oxyntic mucosa showed enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia. Tumor biopsies revealed a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma. Sevier-Munger staining, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy indicated ECL cell as origin of the tumor cells. Concerns have previously been raised about the safety of long-term PPI use due to a possible increased risk of cancer. This case illustrates a patient with a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma with ECL cell characteristics probably induced by hypergastrinemia secondary to long-term PPI use."

This is based on a retrospective examination of surgical resection cases in which patients suitable for such expanded criteria were determined to have a negligible risk of lymph node metastasis. We performed endoscopic submucosal dissection on a 65-year-old male with early gastric cancer in April 2005, and pathology revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, 21 × 10 mm in size, SM1 invasion depth and negative lymphovascular invasion as well as tumor-free margins, so the case was diagnosed as a curative resection.

On pathological examination, GP is characterized by the association of the histological features of paragangliomas, ganglioneuromas, and carcinoid tumors. Classical clinical presentations are upper gastrointestinal bleeding and abdominal pain. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult because of the submucosal site of the tumor, with usually negative mucosal biopsies. Endoscopic ultrasound helps establish the diagnosis and allows lymph node staging, which will guide the choice of the treatment. If GPs usually follow a benign course, metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes treated by surgical resection alone has been reported. We report a case of GP with lymph node metastases treated by duodenopancreatectomy with long-term disease-free survival, suggesting that surgical resection is a reasonable approach for metastatic GPs."

CD009944,0,21842399,0,Esophageal cancer characterization with pneumo-64-MDCT.,"Early diagnosis and accurate staging of esophageal cancer are both essential for therapeutic strategy planning. Endoscopic ultrasound, CT, and positron emission tomography have all been used in the preoperative staging of esophageal cancer separately or in various combinations. Each imaging method has its strengths and weaknesses. Depiction of the tumor's anatomic location conditions the surgical strategy. Endoscopic ultrasound and PET have important advantages but neither provides information for surgical planning. CT scans have some limitations for hollow organ assessment in the absence of lumen distension, since the organ wall may be collapsed. Therefore, optimal esophageal distension could be very useful to overcome these limitations. This potential drawback is crucial at the level of the GE junction, a typically difficult region to evaluate. In order to optimize tumor visualization in the esophageal wall and in the GE junction, we developed a technique named pneumo-64-MDCT. We achieve maximum lumen distension, which better highlights the thickened areas in relation to the normal esophageal wall. At the present time, we have performed 200 studies with this technique and it proved useful, safe and accurate to identify esophageal wall thickening and to stage esophageal cancer. The additional stomach distension led to an adequate definition of both the upper and lower borders of the lesion in tumors located in the GE junction, which in turn was helpful to design the surgical approach."

We herein report on a case of ectopic pancreatic cancer developed in the stomach. A neoplastic lesion was detected in the pyloric part in an upper GIS of a 76-year-old female, requiring biopsy, but because it was classified as Group I, it was observed temporarily. Following blood collection after approximately 2 years, the CA19-9 increased from 177.5 to 279.5, so a GIS was again performed. Although the pyloric part of the stomach became more stenosed than before, it was still considered Group I disease based on biopsy findings. When EUS was performed, the tumor appeared as a submucosal tumor, and was thus suspected as GIST. In an abdominal CT, a neoplastic lesion with a clear boundary was observed in the pylorus, as was an enlarged lymph node in the hepatoduodenal ligament. Therefore malignancy could not be ruled out, and a gastrectomy on the pylorus side, lymph node dissection (D2), and cholecystectomy were performed. The tumor was a submucosal tumor covered by a coherent mucosa. According to histopathological findings, it was diagnosed as ectopic pancreatic cancer developed in the ectopic pancreas (Heinrich type II), consisting of acinar tissue and capillary tubes. Thus ectopic pancreas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of gastric submucosal tumors.

About 1 - 2 % of pancreatic neoplasias are neuroendocrine tumours. About one third of these tumours secrete biologically active substances that lead to development of specific clinical syndromes. PNET may occur sporadically or in association with hereditary syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). Among the functional PNET, insulinomas and gastrinomas are the most common entities. In contrast, vasoactive intetinale peptide (VIP)-secreting tumours, glucagonomas, serotonin-secreting carcinoid tumors, and tumours with secretion of ectopic hormones, such as calcitonin, are extremely rare. Once diagnosis has been established on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings, localization of the source of pathologic hormone secretion is warranted. Imaging methods frequently used for localization of PNET comprise anatomical imaging modalities, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasound, selective arterial catheterization with hepatic venous sampling, DTPA-octreotid scintigraphy and DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotid positron emission tomography.

CD009944,0,21656305,0,[Neuroendocrine tumors of the duodenum and pancreas.

This is mainly based on the broad use of imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic approaches. As a consequence many duodenal and pancreatic tumors are detected in an early stage resulting in an improved prognosis of these patients. Besides the measurement of serum chromogranin A and 5-hydroxy indolic acid measured in 24 h urine collection, CT, endosonographic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopy are important diagnostic tools. About 20% of all patients with pancreatic and duodenal NETs are diagnosed because of specific symptoms. More than 95% of diagnosed NETs are sporadic tumors. Whenever possible these patients should be treated by resection. Benign neuroendocrine duodenal tumors up to 1 cm in size can be removed endoscopically. The endoscopic resection of larger tumors should be performed surgically. The therapy of hereditary NETs of the duodenum and the pancreas should be decided after interdisciplinary discussion. However, even these patients seem to benefit from resection. In case of metastatic disease debulking surgery should be considered if more than 90% of the tumor mass can be resected. In patients with extensive liver metastases but resectable primary NET, liver transplantation is a reasonable option. There is no consensus about adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment of duodenal or pancreatic NETs. The therapy with everolimus or sunitinib in advanced tumor stages has shown promising results. The administration of somatostatin analogues or antacids is appropriate for symptom reduction."

The results show that imunostaining ability of NIR QDs probes is stronger than that of visible QDs when the two kinds of QDs are simultaneously used to probe the cancer biomarkers such as cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in gastric cancer tissues. Moreover, when the two QDs probes are used for immunostaining successively for the same target molecules, staining order has great influences on the final results due to their different conjugating ability to the marker proteins. The results imply that NIR QDs hold more promise for real-time imaging of tumor tissues due to its higher sensitivity and contrast.

Intramucosal and submucosal carcinomas were differentiated on the basis of the different types, height of intraluminal growth and bilateral growth, and depth of intramural growth type. The accuracy of differentiate diagnosis was 87.2%. Our results indicate that this new endoscopic classification system can accurately differentiate intramucosal and submucosal infiltration of early-stage esophageal carcinomas."

The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess toxicity and outcome of patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy for early esophageal cancer at one institution. A retrospective analysis of all patients treated with chemoradiotherapy between February 2000 and December 2008 at a single tertiary center was performed with documentation of treatment given, toxicities recorded, and follow-up and outcome data. Sixty-two patients received chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer. There were 20 males and 42 female patients with an average age of 68 years. Histology revealed adenocarcinoma in 28 patients and squamous cell carcinoma in 34 patients. All patients were staged with a computerized tomography scan, endoscopic ultrasound and positron emission tomography scan. Selection criteria for chemoradiotherapy were unfit for surgery, upper esophageal squamous carcinoma, unresectable primary tumor, or patient choice. The majority of the patients received a combination of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy with 55 Gy in 25 fractions of radiotherapy. Grade 3 toxicities were recorded in 11% of the patients. Eleven patients suffered from local recurrence and a stent was required in nine patients. Radiation strictures occurred in 10 patients requiring dilation in four. Five patients required a radiologically inserted feeding gastrostomy. The median overall survival was 21 months. Patients with adenocarcinomas and those with squamous cell carcinoma had a similar median survival. Overall survival was 70% at 1 year, 48% at 2 years, and 26% at 3 years. This case series of patients treated with chemoradiation for localized esophageal cancer suggest a generally well-tolerated treatment with survival rates after chemoradiotherapy comparable with those seen with surgery."

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of EUS in determining the depth of penetration (T stage) and nodal status (N stage) in patients with esophageal cancer who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). A retrospective analysis of all patients at a university hospital who underwent preoperative EUS followed by MIE for cancer was performed. We compared the results of preoperative EUS to final pathologic analyses of the esophageal specimen, examining the accuracy of EUS staging. Ninety-five patients with esophageal cancer who underwent MIE had preoperative EUS. Twenty-four of the 95 patients were excluded for lack of a repeat EUS after neoadjuvant therapy before resection. Hence, 71 patients were evaluated for the accuracy of EUS staging. The accuracy of EUS for T0 disease was 80 per cent; T1 disease was 75 per cent; T2 disease was 39 per cent; and T3 disease was 88 per cent. The overall EUS accuracy for T stage was 72 per cent with overstaging occurring mostly for pathologic T1 tumors in 18 per cent and understaging occurring mostly for pathologic T3 tumors in 11 per cent. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of nodal involvement were 79 per cent and 74 per cent, respectively. However the accuracy for T and N staging by EUS after neoadjuvant therapy decreased to 63 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively. Endoscopic ultrasound in the absence of neoadjuvant therapy is a relatively accurate and sensitive modality for determining the depth of tumor penetration and the presence of nodal disease in patients with esophageal carcinoma.

The rapid-acquisition fiber-optic Raman endoscopy system developed was employed for in vivo gastric tissue Raman measurements at 785 nm laser excitation. A total of 1063 in vivo Raman spectra were acquired from 238 tissue sites of 67 gastric patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasound staging procedure, in which 934 Raman spectra were from 121 normal tissue sites whereas 129 Raman spectra were from 117 neoplastic gastric tissue sites. Gastric Raman spectra were fitted and reconstructed by using a linear combination of the eight basis reference spectra from the biochemicals (i.e., actin, albumin, collagen, DNA, histones, pepsinogen, phospholipids and triolein) in gastric tissue and also compared with the in vivo gastric Raman spectra measured. The resulting fit coefficients were further utilized through recursive partitioning techniques to develop diagnostic algorithms for gastric cancer diagnosis. High-quality in vivo Raman spectra in the range of 800-1800 cm(-1) can be acquired from gastric mucosa within 0.5s. The fit coefficients from albumin, nucleic acid, phospholipids and histones were found to be the most significant features for construction of the diagnostic model, giving rise to an overall accuracy of 93.7% (i.e., sensitivity of 94.0% (110/117) and specificity of 93.4% (113/121)) for in vivo discrimination of cancerous tissue from normal gastric tissue after the leave-one tissue site-out, cross-validation technique.

CD009944,0,20676872,0,Clinical staging of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction.,"Tumors of the esophagogastric junction are among the most frequent and cause lethal cancers. Patients often do not present until late in the disease when the tumor is sufficiently large to cause obstruction or invasion of the adjacent structures, and thus becomes symptomatic. Preoperative staging is critical to select those patients whose disease is still locally confined for curative surgery. Ideally, clinical staging should accurately predict tumor invasion, lymph node involvement, and distant metastases. Upper endoscopy establishes the tumor diagnosis by multiple biopsies and defines the tumor type (Siewert I-III), based on tumor localization in relation to the endoscopic cardia. Preoperative TNM staging has a strong impact on treatment strategy. Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) determines the T category, and to a lesser extent, the presence of lymph node metastases. Multislice Computed Tomography (CT) and 18Fluorode-ocx-glucose Positron Emission Computed Tomography (18FDG-PET-CT) provide further information, especially about systemic metastases. Diagnostic laparascopy is suggested in advanced (CT3/4) Siewert type II-III tumors to exclude peritoneal carcinomatosis.

Nowadays most carcinoids of the stomach are diagnosed at an early stage. Four types of gastric NETs have been proposed and recognition of the type is important for defining the diagnostic approach and treatment. Often gastric NETs (especially type 1) are found incidentally during a gastroscopy performed for other reasons; most of these NETs are smaller than 20 mm in size. Conservative management and endoscopic surveillance is adequate for well differentiated, multifocal gastric carcinoids (type 1 or type 2 gastric NETs) that are less than 10 - 20 mm in diameter, unless they show angioinvasion, infiltrate the muscular wall, or have a proliferation rate above 2 %. Endoscopic ultrasound is the method of choice to determine tumor size and depth of infiltration. It is essential to distinguish between multifocal (types 1 and 2) and unifocal type 3 or type 4 gastric NETs, since surgery is indicated for type 3 gastric NETs larger than 10 mm in diameter and for poorly differentiated (localized) neuroendocrine gastric carcinomas (type 4 gastric NET).

CD009944,0,20547601,0,Endoscopic ultrasound: a review of current diagnostic and therapeutic applications.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become important in a variety of clinical settings. Echoendoscopes may be categorised into radial and linear configurations. Radial devices are used for diagnostic imaging, whereas linear echoendoscopes also facilitate image guided tissue sampling and intervention. EUS is an established primary diagnostic tool for a number of conditions including choledocholithiasis and biliary microlithiasis. It is therefore well suited to the investigation of the aetiology of pancreatitis where simpler measures fail to identify the aetiology. It can also be used to identify chronic non-calcific pancreatitis. EUS is important in the secondary evaluation of abnormalities detected by other imaging modalities-for example, cystic pancreatic lesions. The high resolution of EUS allows more detailed image based analysis than other imaging modalities. The ability to sample cyst fluid significantly increases the accuracy of lesion characterisation. Most importantly, EUS has become indispensable in the staging of a variety of upper gastrointestinal tract tumours. If resection is being considered, the high resolution images obtained via EUS are invaluable for local tumour staging. EUS guided tissue sampling permits accurate nodal staging without relying on lymph node size as proxy for malignant infiltration. In patients with contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging, EUS is an alternative for the staging of rectal carcinoma. It is used in the staging of lung cancer, often in combination with endobronchial ultrasound. Finally, EUS is used therapeutically in image guided drainage (such as gastrocystostomy in pancreatic pseudocyst) and coeliac plexus neurolysis in patients with abdominal pain caused by pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis."

In addition to clinical assessment and biochemical tests, imaging is a major factor in establishing the diagnosis. Cross-sectional imaging such as US, CT and MR, play a major role in the initial assessment. However, they may miss small lesions or metastatic spread. Functional Imaging became possible with the development of somatostatin receptor imaging using 111In-octreotide, which when combined with anatomical imaging could provide enhanced detection. A major improvement has been achieved by combining receptor and PET inaging through the use of 68Ga-DOTA complexes that have been shown to have a much better sensitivity than other imaging modalities and can provide the basis for radionuclide treatment with 90Y or 177Lu labelled with DOTA complexes."

EUS has, therefore, to be integrated into the standard staging procedure of gastric lymphoma, although its impact on initial treatment decisions might be limited in the individual case. A benefit from the use of miniechoendoscopes, EUS elastography and EUS-guided biopsies has not yet been proven in gastric lymphoma. EUS also confers an important prognostic value regarding treatment responses to Helicobacter pylori eradication. On the contrary, EUS cannot be recommended as a regular part of follow-up investigations considering its limited value in predicting the response of the lymphoma to radiation or chemotherapy."
CD009944,0,20206103,0,Diagnosis and staging in gastrointestinal lymphoma.,"The diagnosis gastrointestinal lymphoma can be made on endoscopic biopsies in the vast majority of cases. Definitive subtyping of the lymphoma according to the WHO classification with the use of additional immunological and molecular markers is the cornerstone for further decision making. Several lymphomas may occur multifocally or show both small cell and large cell components. Therefore, a second endoscopy with an extensive biopsy protocol (mapping) may be mandatory. Staging procedures are required for therapeutic decision making and should include CT-scan, laboratory studies and bone marrow examination as required in other lymphomas. Additional studies must be performed depending subtype and localisation of the lymphoma. In gastric lymphoma endosonography reveals prognostic information. In marginal zone lymphoma of MALT-type attention to other MALT-sites and autoimmune diseases is necessary. In enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma screening for coeliac disease and enteroscopy are required. In several lymphomas (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma) a PET-scan is considered as standard of care. The value of staging procedures after treatment is less well defined. At least in gastric lymphomas, histology is the gold standard after treatment and during follow-up."

Patients with histiocytic sarcoma usually have a poor prognosis due to its aggressive clinical behavior. Here we report a rare case of extranodal histiocytic sarcoma of the stomach which was confirmed through immunohistochemical staining. A 71-year- old man was presented with epigastric pain. Gastroscopy, abdominal CT, and EUS revealed a mass located on the posterior wall of upper body and fundus of the stomach. Grossly, grayish white solid masses were seen extending down to the submucosal layer. Microscopically, the tumor cells had eosinophilic cytoplasm, abundant vacuole, and mitosis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the tumor cells were positive for LCA, CD68, and lysozyme. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of this rare neoplasm is important because it can make a great difference in prognostic outcomes. To make an accurate and definitive diagnosis, immunohistochemical staining is essential in the confirmation of histiocytic origin."

CD009944,0,20214236,0,Facing the challenge of managing linitis plastica--review of the literature.,"Linitis Plastica (LP) denotes a diffuse, intra-murally infiltrating, anaplastic carcinoma in a hollow structure resulting in a shrunken organ with thickened walls. The neoplasm is encountered in every segment of gastrointestinal tract with the gastric localization being the most frequent and simultaneous or successive affection of different digestive sites rarely reported. Symptoms often associated with LP of the stomach include pain and lump in the epigastrium, weight loss, anorexia, dysphagia, nausea and vomiting. Diagnosis of LP-type adenocarcinomas of the stomach has traditionally been achieved by brush cytology and mucosal biopsy. Nevertheless, these techniques may yield false negative results due to potential submucosal location of the lesion. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) contributes to the detection of abundant, independent malignant cells indicative of an anaplastic neoplasm. The characteristic histopathological feature of this entity is cellular spread to the submucosa and stroma with minimal mucosal alterations accompanied by an excessive desmoplastic reaction. Despite recent research on alternative therapies, surgical resection appears the only potentially curative approach. The aim of this review was to evaluate the results of current diagnostic modalities and surgical interventions for LP with special reference to the extent of its histological dissemination and to present the recent literature in order to provide an update on the contemporary concepts of therapeutic management of the disease."
CD009944,0,20214235,0,Mini-laparotomy with abdominal wall lifting for partial gastrectomy in patients with early gastric mucosal cancer at lesser curvature of the middle stomach.,"Partial gastrectomy (PG) is the most frequently adopted minimally invasive procedure for early gastric cancer (EGC), especially mucosal cancer (MC). The aim of this study was to introduce a minimally invasive procedure, i.e., minilaparotomy with abdominal wall lifting for PG in patients with early mucosal gastric cancer at the lesser curvature of the middle stomach. Well differentiated adenocarcionoma in MC at the lesser curvature of the middle stomach was selected, where no lymph node metastasis (NO) was confirmed using ultrasonic endoscopy, CT, and MRI during the preoperative examinations. PG was also chosen for patients with a tumor size of 2cm or less and non-depressive type in whom endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal resection (ESD) was not possible. Five MC patients (3 men and 2 women, aged 44-62 years, mean age 53.3 years) underwent mini-laparotomy with abdominal wall lifting for PG. Our procedure involved a 6 cm upper abdominal median incision made at the beginning of the operation. The upper abdominal wall was lifted by a subcutaneous Kirshner wire. The small wound was also pulled upward and/or laterally by Kent retractors and conventional surgical instruments were used through the wound. The middle stomach could be detected through the small wound and partially resected, approximately 1 cm from the tumor edge under the guide of the endoscope. The resected stomach margin was stitched layer-to-layer. In this way, PG was easily completed. The total surgical time was 71.8 +/- 12.9 min and the mean estimated blood loss was 30.8 +/- 20.5 ml. Day of starting diet was 3 +/- 0.7 days after operation. Post-operative hospitalization was 8.2 +/- 1.3 days. There was no surgical mortality. All subjects were satisfied with this procedure. Mini-laparotomy with abdominal wall lifting is a safe and efficient technique in the treatment of PG for MC with NO at the lesser curvature of the middle stomach when EMR or ESD is impossible."

CD009944,0,20076819,0,Staging laparoscopy in digestive cancers.,"BACKGROUND. Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography may assist in the more accurate staging of digestive cancers. We assessed the diagnostic value of staging laparoscopy in patients with cancers of lower esophagus, stomach, liver, biliary tract, pancreas and colon. MATERIAL AND METHOD. Extended staging laparoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasonography and peritoneal cytology were performed in 165 patients with primary digestive cancers, admitted between January 2006 and December 2008 at three tertiary referral hospitals participating in the study. Staging laparoscopy was immediately followed by open surgery in 63 patients without distant metastases or with uncertain primary tumor resectability, and in 20 colorectal cancer patients with resectable hepatic metastases. The sensibility, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of staging laparoscopy for distant metastases and tumor resectability were assessed against the findings on open surgery and the final pathological report. RESULTS. An unnecessary laparotomy was avoided in 36 of the 99 patients (36.4%) without distant metastases on imaging pre-therapeutic staging. The staging laparoscopy sensitivity for distant metastases varied between 66% and 100% and the diagnostic accuracy between 87% for the lower esophageal cancer and 100% for the biliary tract tumors. The overall morbidity of staging laparoscopy was 2.5% and the mortality 0. CONCLUSION. Staging laparoscopy avoids unnecessary laparotomies and changes the therapeutic plan in a significant number of patients. It can be performed just before the planned surgery or as a separate diagnostic procedure. The laparoscopy indications in digestive cancers are changing fast, with ongoing new developments in cancer treatment and laparoscopic technology."

The patient was a 60-year-old woman in whom esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a submucosal tumor, about 25 mm in size, in the upper body of the stomach, with ulceration at the top of the tumor. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a well-defined hypoechoic mass located in the proper muscle layer of the stomach. The specimen taken from the tumor showed only inflammatory degenerative tissue. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a tumor in the upper body of the stomach. FDG-PET showed FDG uptake (standardized uptake value [SUV] max 5.8) coincident with the tumor. Hence, the tumor was diagnosed initially as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the stomach. Laparoscopic partial gastrectomy was performed. Pathological examination showed that the tumor consisted of spindle cells with large nuclei, and mitosis was absent. The Ki-67 labeling index of the tumor cells was 4%. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed a positive reaction for S-100 protein, whereas they were negative for KIT, CD 34, and alpha-smooth muscle actin protein. The tumor was diagnosed as a benign gastric schwannoma. Gastric schwannoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of submucosal tumors of the stomach with FDG uptake."

Even without accurate diagnosis before treatment, open or laparoscopic surgery is currently carried out to remove SMT. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in diagnostic treatment for submucosal tumor (SMT) of the stomach. Subjects in this case study comprised nine patients who had undergone ESD for gastric SMT. Before treatment, endoscopic ultrasonography was carried out in all cases to evaluate depth and origin of the SMT. Then ESD was only indicated for tumors of submucosal layer or muscularis mucosa origin. Using an endoscopic sub-tumoral dissection technique with a hook knife and a flex knife, local complete resections were achieved in all patients without severe complications. These results suggest the clinical benefits of ESD avoiding oversurgery for the diagnostic treatment of gastric SMT of the submucosal layer and muscularis mucosa origin."

CD009944,0,19942829,0,Endoscopic evaluation and treatment of esophageal cance.,"Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer mortality. During the past twenty years the prevalence of adenocarcinoma, which is linked to gastroesophageal reflux and Barrett's metaplasia, has increased precipitously for unclear reasons. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has revolutionized primary tumor (T) and nodal (N) staging. Additionally, the recent introduction of combined computed and positron emission tomography (CT-PET) promises to improve the detection of distant metastasis. While classic surgical approaches have significant morbidity and mortality, the recent widespread introduction of minimally invasive techniques including endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation offer new options to those with limited disease. Finally, endoscopically placed self expandable metal stents have become the primary mode of palliating dysphagia and there is a growing interest in the use of removable stents to optimize nutrition in neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients awaiting esophagectomy. In this article we will review the presentation, staging, and treatment of esophageal cancer with an emphasis on the evolving role of endoscopy to help accomplish these objectives."
CD009944,0,19902288,0,[Therapy in gastric cancer.

The absolute benefit in overall survival was 13% and 14% after 5 years. This benefit is clearly shown for patients with locally advanced tumors but remains debatable in early disease stages. Postoperative mortality and the complication rate were not increased. Based on published study results perioperative chemotherapy has to be regarded as the new standard of care at least for patients staged as uT3/uT4 tumors as defined by endoscopic ultrasound. To date there are no indications for adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation after R0 resection and adequate surgery.

CD009944,0,19788616,0,Diagnostic findings of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology for gastrointestinal stromal tumors: proposal of a combined cytology with newly defined features and histology diagnosis.,"Recently, endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has been applied for diagnosis of gastrointestinal submucosal tumors. There have been no definite criteria, however, for the adequate cytological diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in practice. To facilitate this a novel method is proposed that combines cytology and histology. For 49 cases of submucosal tumor of gastrointestinal tract, EUS-FNA was performed. The aspirated materials were processed for cytology and histology. Both cytological and histological findings were examined on immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical staining of c-kit. Of 49 cases, 40 (81.6%) proved adequate for cytological and/or histological examination. On cytology, cluster types were classified into type A (piled clusters with high cellularity showing a fascicular pattern), type B (thin layered clusters with high cellularity showing a fascicular pattern), and type C (mono-layered clusters or scattered cells). Types A and B were strongly associated with histological diagnosis of GIST. Type C clusters needed confirmation on c-kit positivity and histology. Thus, the combined cytology with newly defined features, and classification and histological diagnostic method for EUS-FNA materials can contribute to improved routine diagnosis for GIST."
CD009944,0,19744639,0,Contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound and elastosonoendoscopy.,"Until recently, there was no contrast harmonic imaging technique available for EUS examination. Second-generation US contrast agents produce harmonic signals at lower acoustic powers and, therefore, are suitable for EUS imaging at low acoustic powers. CE-EUS could provide a contribution to the differential diagnosis between a primary pancreatic carcinoma, chronic pancreatitis and a pancreatic metastasis, and therefore can have a decisive influence on the selection of appropriate therapeutic strategies (follow-up, chemotherapy or surgery, for example). However, histology remains the standard in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumours. Regarding lymph nodes, CE-EUS cannot replace EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration. Elastography examines the elastic properties of tissues by applying a slight compression to the tissue and comparing an image obtained before and after this compression. EUS elastography is a new application in the field of endosonography and seems to be able to differentiate fibrous and benign tissue from malignant lesions. While our results are very encouraging, further research will be needed to further define the place of this new technique and should be aimed at further defining criteria for accurate elastography as well as subsequently assessing the technique using multiple operators in a blinded setting. EUS-guided sonoelastography has the potential for further guiding the diagnosis and therapy of gastrointestinal-related tumours."
CD009944,0,19744633,0,The role of endosonography in submucosal tumours.,"Submucosal tumours (SMTs) are relatively common findings in patients undergoing endoscopy, especially in upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This term includes various non-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the best imaging procedure to characterise SMT and to determine the need for further explorations. In this review, the following issues will be addressed: the endosonographic features of SMT; the diagnostic accuracy of EUS; the ability of EUS to distinguish benign and malignant SMTs; the value of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA); and the influence of EUS on clinical management."
CD009944,0,19744632,0,The impact of EUS in primary gastric lymphoma.,"Gastric lymphoma is the most frequent site of gastrointestinal lymphoma and is accessible for endosonographic evaluation. Most primary gastric lymphomas are classified as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphomas that develop in the course of chronic Helicobacter pylori infection. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is regarded to be the most accurate method for the local staging of gastric lymphoma, although scientific evidence is limited. In stage uEI1 low-grade lymphoma, EUS is able to predict a high chance for cure by H. pylori eradication. The significance of EUS elastography or EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy to diagnose nodal involvement has not been investigated in prospective series yet. Since high-grade lymphoma is always treated as a systemic disease, the impact of endosonographic staging is lower than in low-grade lymphoma. After treatment of primary gastric lymphoma, EUS produces conflicting results that are not as accurate as endoscopy with biopsy. Therefore, EUS is not mandatory during follow-up."
CD009944,0,19744631,0,Endosonographic staging of lower intestinal malignancy.,"The use of EUS in the assessment of rectal pathology is well established. The accurate staging of lower intestinal tumours predicts prognosis and guides the planning of individual patient treatment. Increased experience and the development of high resolution three-dimensional EUS has lead to the greater accuracy of rectal staging with EUS of rectal tumours now considered the gold standard showing T stage accuracy that ranges from 75% to 95%, with N stage accuracy ranging from 65% to 80%. The use of EUS in the staging of colonic pathology, however, is not so well established though advances in miniprobe EUS has improved the assessment of colonic tumours. EUS is also of benefit in the assessment of anal pathology though here, accurate correlation with histology has not been firmly established."
CD009944,0,19744630,0,Endosonographic staging of upper intestinal malignancy.,"Numerous studies conducted over the last 25 years provide evidence on the high diagnostic accuracy and important role of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in staging oesophageal and gastric carcinoma. This extensive research was recently subjected to metaanalyses, condensing our knowledge on EUS performance and facilitating its comparison with competing methods. It is, however, important to realise that the management of oesophageal and gastric carcinoma is evolving and so are staging algorithms, setting new challenges for EUS and re-defining its position. Restaging after neoadjuvant treatment and precise assessment of early carcinoma before endoscopic treatment are areas of growing interest, but the role of EUS in these settings is rather limited. Rapidly developing cross-sectional imaging has the potential to challenge the position of EUS as the most accurate method in loco-regional staging. On the other hand, EUS guided fine-needle aspiration offers the unique opportunity to obtain cytological confirmation of lymph node metastases, with future potential for molecular staging."
CD009944,0,19744629,0,Endosonography of high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia/early cancer.,"Endosonography (EUS) is frequently used for staging of early malignant gastrointestinal lesions. High-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and mucosal cancer have a very low risk for lymphatic metastasis and therefore are suitable for endoscopic therapy. In HGIN and early oesophageal and gastric cancer, high-frequency miniprobes can provide detailed imaging of the different layers. However, diagnostic accuracy differentiating between mucosal and submucosal disease is not sufficient, and therefore (diagnostic) endoscopic resection should be performed in all localisable lesions to detect submucosal cancer at risk for lymph node metastasis. EUS for lymph node staging is considered to be the method with the highest accuracy, especially compared with computed tomography."

This phase II study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of administering preoperative epirubicin/cisplatin/capecitabine (ECX). Patients with stage II or III oesophageal/gastro-oesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma from one institution received 4 cycles of ECX (epirubicin 50 mg m(-2) day 1, cisplatin 60 mg m(-2) day 1, capecitabine 625 mg m(-2) b.i.d. daily) followed by surgery. The primary end point was the pathological complete response (pCR) rate based on a Simon two-stage design. Secondary end points included overall and progression-free survival (OS/PFS). Thirty-four patients were recruited: median age 60 years (range 41-81), 91% male, 97% PS 0/1, 80% T3, 68% N1. Thirty-one patients completed four ECX cycles. Grade 3/4 toxicities >or=5% included neutropenia (62%), hand-foot syndrome (15%) and nausea/vomiting (9%). Thirteen out of 28 (46%) evaluable patients responded to chemotherapy by EUS (>or=30% reduction in maximal tumour thickness). Twenty-six out of 34 (76%) patients underwent resection (R0=73%, R1=27%). Post-operatively, two patients died within 60 days of surgery. The pCR rate was 5.9% (95% CI 0-14%) in the intent-to-treat population. According to the statistical design, this prompted early study termination. However, with a median follow-up of 34 months the median OS and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 17 months, 67 and 39% respectively. Median PFS was 13 months. Of the 14 relapsed patients, 10 presented with distant metastases. Preoperative ECX is feasible and well tolerated. Although associated with a low pCR rate, survival with ECX was comparable with published studies suggesting that pCR may not correlate with satisfactory outcome from preoperative chemotherapy for localised oesophageal adenocarcinoma."

CD009944,0,19191855,0,International survey on esophageal cancer: part II staging and neoadjuvant therapy.,"The outcome of esophagectomy could be improved by optimal diagnostic strategies leading to adequate preoperative patient selection. Neoadjuvant therapy could improve outcome by increasing the number of radical resections and by controlling metastatic disease. The purposes of this study were to gain insight into the current worldwide practice of staging modalities and neoadjuvant therapy in esophageal cancer, and to detect intercontinental differences. Surgeons with particular interest in esophageal surgery, including members of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus, the European Society of Esophagology - Group d'Etude Européen des Maladies de l'Oesophage, and the OESO, were invited to participate in an online questionnaire. Questions were asked regarding staging modalities, neoadjuvant therapy, and response evaluation applied in esophageal cancer patients. Of 567 invited surgeons, 269 participated resulting in a response rate of 47%. The responders currently performing esophagectomies (n= 250; 44%) represented 41 countries across the six continents. Esophagogastroscopy with biopsy and computed tomography (CT) scanning were routinely performed by 98% of responders for diagnosing and staging esophageal cancer, while endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and barium esophagography were routinely applied by 58% and 51%, respectively. Neoadjuvant therapy is routinely administered by 33% and occasionally by 63% of responders. Of the responders that administer identical neoadjuvant regimens to esophageal adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma, 54% favor chemoradiotherapy. For AC, chemotherapy is preferred by 31% of the responders that administer neoadjuvant therapy, whereas for squamous cell carcinoma, the majority of responders (38%) prefer chemoradiotherapy. Response to neoadjuvant therapy is predominantly assessed by CT scanning of the chest and abdomen (86%). Barium esophagography, EUS, and combined CT/PET scan are requested for response monitoring in equal frequency (25%). Substantial differences in applied staging modalities and neoadjuvant regimens were detected between surgeons from different continents. In conclusion, currently the most commonly applied diagnostic modalities for staging and restaging esophageal cancer are CT scanning of the chest and abdomen, gastroscopy, barium esophagography and EUS. Neoadjuvant therapy is routinely applied by one third of the responders. Intercontinental differences have been detected in the diagnostic modalities applied in esophageal cancer staging and in the administration of neoadjuvant therapy. The results of this survey provide baseline data for future research and for the development of international guidelines."

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are undoubtedly the commonest malignant SMTs of the stomach, and therefore the attitude towards the general diagnostic approach for GISTs defines the extended diagnostic plan for SMTs. Two recent consensus meetings were assembled concerning the classification and therapeutic plans for GISTs. These meetings shed light upon the need for the modification of the current role of imaging modalities, including endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and computed tomography (CT). According to the revised concepts of GISTs, the most important and plausible current role of imaging for the diagnostic approach of gastric SMTs is to differentiate GISTs from other gastric SMTs. This review discusses the newly established diagnostic role of radiology according to the revised classification of GISTs and provides the differential diagnoses based on EUS and CT findings."
CD009944,0,19021684,0,Adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus with Barrett's esophagus or without Barrett's esophagus: differences in patients' survival after preoperative chemoradiation.,"It remains unclear whether the overall survival (OS) of patients with localized esophageal adenocarcinoma (LEA) with Barrett's esophagus (BE) (Barrett's-positive) and those with LEA without BE (Barrett's-negative) following preoperative chemoradiation is different. Based on the published differences in the molecular biology of the two entities, we hypothesized that the two groups will have a different clinical biology (and OS). In this retrospective analysis, all patients with LEA had surgery following preoperative chemoradiation. Apart from age, gender, baseline clinical stage, location, class of cytotoxics, post-therapy stage, and OS, LEAs were divided up into Barrett's-positive and Barrett's-negative groups based on histologic documentation of BE. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analytic methods were used. We analyzed 362 patients with LEA (137 Barrett's-positive and 225 Barrett's-negative). A higher proportion of Barrett's-positive patients had (EUS)T2 cancers (27%) than those with Barrett's-negative cancer (17%). More Barrett's-negative LEAs involved gastroesophageal junction than Barrett's-positive ones (P = 0.001). The OS was significantly shorter for Barrett's-positive patients than that for Barrett's-negative patients (32 months vs. 51 months; P = 0.04). In a multivariate analysis for OS, Barrett's-positive LEA (P = 0.006), old age (P = 0.016), baseline positive nodes (P = 0.005), more than 2 positive (yp)N (P = 0.0001), higher (yp)T (P = 0.003), and the use of a taxane (0.04) were the independent prognosticators. Our data demonstrate that the clinical biology (reflected in OS) is less favorable for patients with Barrett's-positive LEA than for patients with Barrett's-negative LEA. Our intriguing findings need confirmation followed by in-depth molecular study to explain these differences."

Meta-analysis and systematic review.,"Published data on accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in differentiating T stages of rectal cancers is varied. Study selection criteria were to select only EUS studies confirmed with results of surgical pathology. Articles were searched in Medline and Pubmed. Pooling was conducted by both fixed and random effects models. Initial search identified 3,630 reference articles, of which 42 studies (N = 5,039) met the inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of EUS to determine T1 stage was 87.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 85.3-90.0%] and 98.3% (95% CI 97.8-98.7%), respectively. For T2 stage, EUS had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 80.5% (95% CI 77.9-82.9%) and 95.6% (95% CI 94.9-96.3%), respectively. To stage T3 stage, EUS had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 96.4% (95% CI 95.4-97.2%) and 90.6% (95% CI 89.5-91.7%), respectively. In determining the T4 stage, EUS had a pooled sensitivity of 95.4% (95% CI 92.4-97.5%) and specificity of 98.3% (95% CI 97.8-98.7%). The p value for chi-squared heterogeneity for all the pooled accuracy estimates was > 0.10. We conclude that, as a result of the demonstrated sensitivity and specificity, EUS should be the investigation of choice to T stage rectal cancers. The sensitivity of EUS is higher for advanced disease than for early disease. EUS should be strongly considered for T staging of rectal cancers."

The peak age for harboring GIST of the stomach is around 60 years and a slight male preponderance is reported. These tumors are identified by expression of CD117 or CD34 antigen. Symptoms at presentation usually include bleeding, abdominal pain or abdominal mass. Endoscopically, they typically appear as a submucosal mass with or without ulceration and on CT scans an extragastric mass is usually seen. Complete surgical resection provides the only chance for cure, with only 1-2 cm free margins needed.

Patients referred to two surgeons in an Australian metropolitan teaching hospital with esophageal or esophago-gastric junction malignancy between May 2002 and December 2006 were included. Patients who had undergone prereferral treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. Patients undergoing resection for gastrointestinal stromal tumors or high-grade dysplasia within Barrett's esophagus were also excluded. Clinical and non-clinical data were recorded prospectively. Pretreatment staging included routine CT scan and selective endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). FDG-PET was performed in patients judged to have curable disease on CT scanning and EUS. From a total of 130 eligible patients, 76 were judged to have curable disease on the basis of CT and EUS findings. Of these 76 patients, 19 (25%) were excluded from surgery due to additional information obtained from FDG-PET. The addition of FDG-PET to routine preoperative staging resulted in the exclusion from surgery of 19 (25%) patients who prior to the introduction of FDG-PET would have undergone attempted resection. FDG-PET should be performed in all patients under consideration for esophagogastric resection in order to avoid resection in patients with disseminated disease."

Gastrointestinal glomus tumors are rare and most frequently occur in the stomach as a subepithelial tumor. A 46-year-old woman presented with an incidental finding of a subepithelial tumor in the stomach. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed a 1.4chi1 cm sized well circumscribed heterogeneous hypoechoic tumor with a few tubular structures in the fourth sonographic layer of the gastric wall. Characteristically, more hypoechoic halo equal to the echogenecity of proper muscle layer enclosed the tumor. Contrast enhanced abdominal computerized tomography (CT) revealed high enhancement of tumor up to the same level of portal vein in arterial phase and this enhancement persisted to portal phase. For histolgogic confirmation and treatment, endoscopic enucleation was attempted but failed due to fibrotic adhesion with the surrounding tissue. Histologic findings of biopsy specimen were compatible with glomus tumor.

Appropriate treatment depends on a thorough staging process to exclude the presence of distant metastatic disease. Current staging modalities include high-quality CT scan, endoscopic ultrasound, PET, and laparoscopy. The value of peritoneal lavage to detect occult peritoneal disease is under investigation. The principles of surgical resection have always included negative resection margins and adequate lymph node examination. Controversial topics requiring further study include laparoscopic resections and hepatic metastasectomy. This review highlights the salient points of current surgical management of gastric adenocarcinoma."

CD009944,0,18840132,0,The impact of endoscopic ultrasonography with fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) on esophageal cancer staging: a survey of thoracic surgeons and gastroenterologists.,"Accurate staging of esophageal cancer is critical to achieving optimal treatment outcomes. End-oscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has emerged as a valuable tool for locoregional staging. However, it is unclear how different physician specialties perceive the benefit of EUS-FNA for esophageal cancer staging, and thus utilize this modality in clinical practice. A survey regarding utilization of EUS-FNA in esophageal cancer was distributed to 211 thoracic surgeons and 251 EUS-capable gastroenterologists. Seventy-six thoracic surgeons (36%) and 78 gastroenterologists (31%) responded to the survey. Most surgeons (75%) use EUS to stage potentially resectable esophageal cancer 75% of the time. Surgeons using EUS less often are less likely to have access to high-quality EUS services than their peers. Fewer surgeons believe EUS is the most accurate test for T and N-staging (84% and 71%, respectively) as compared with gastroenterologists (97% and 96%, P < 0.01 for both). Most endosonographers (68%) decide whether to dilate a malignant esophageal stricture to complete the staging exam on a case-by-case basis. Surgeons disagree as to whether involvement of celiac lymph nodes should preclude esophagectomy in distal esophageal cancer. While most thoracic surgeons have embraced EUS-FNA as the most accurate locoregional staging modality in esophageal cancer, this attitude is not fully reflected in utilization patterns due to a lack of quality EUS services in some centers. Controversial areas that warrant further study include dilation of malignant strictures to facilitate EUS staging, and the implication of involved celiac lymph nodes on management."
CD009944,0,18833142,0,[Results of surgical treatment of residual and recurrent anal tumors].,"Radio- or chemotherapy is a modern standard of anal cancer treatment. Recurrence or partial remission rate after radiochemotherapy achieves 20-40%. The study is aimed to evaluate the role of abdominoperineal resection in the treatment of residual and recurrent anal cancer. 120 patients (aged from 30 to 81 (59+/-11) years, men:women ratio--1:9) were prospectively studied in the period of 1995 to 2007. The TNM distribution was as follows: T1-2N0M0--66(55.0%), T3-4N0M0--18(15.0%), T1-2N1-3M0--15(12.5%) and T3-4N1-3M0--21(17.5%) patients. The radiotherapy delivered in a dose range of 55-65 Gy was used alone or in combination with chemotherapy with 5-fluoruracil, mitomycin C or Xeloda. The complete tumor regression after radiotherapy/radiochemotherapy was achieved in 74(61.1%) of 120 patients with cancer-specific survival rate of 81.7%. Partial tumor regression was registered in 46 of 120 patients. The abdominoperineal resection was performed in 39(84.8%) of patients with the residual tumor. Thus, surgical treatment allowed secondary local tumor control in 76.9% of patients with the 5-year survival rates of 69.0%. The median survival time for the non-operated patients, including those, received an extra course of radiotherapy, was 19 months. The locoregional tumor relapse was diagnosed in 10(13.74%) of 74 patients with the complete tumor regression. The use of abdominoperineal resection allowed the secondary local tumor control and 5 year survival. Thus, abdominoperineal resection remains the method of choice in the treatment of residual and recurrent anal tumors."

CD009944,0,18810677,0,[Miniprobe EUS].,"With the advent of flexible, high-frequency catheter probes that can be introduced through the working channel of any endoscope, EUS became available as an additional and very powerful diagnostic tool during routine endoscopic procedures. Miniprobes as a supplement to echoendoscopes with radial or longitudinal scanners provide detailed images with a penetration depth of about 20 mm using frequencies of around 20 MHz. Not only structures of the intestinal wall but also a considerable volume of the surrounding organs can be visualised. In the intestine sonographic coupling is best accomplished using bare miniprobes with water filling of the lumen. Out of 1007 miniprobe examinations carried out in the author's clinic, the most frequent indications involved the distal bile and pancreatic ducts (36 %), carcinoma of the oesophagus or the cardia (18 %), submucosal tumours and GIST (14 %), and others (32 %). For evaluating the distal common bile duct, extraductal EUS (EDUS) allows the visualisation of small pathological lesions, especially intraductal stones without ductal dilatation with a sensitivity of 97 % and a specificity of 98 %. For the staging of early cancers, miniprobe EUS has its significance mainly in showing a preserved submucosal layer, thereby excluding an endoscopically non-resectable T 2 lesion, as was successfully done in all of our cases. Suspicious prominent structures were easily assigned to the correct layer of the wall or identified as external impressions."

Endosonography is not used in the primary detection and diagnosis of gastric cancer, but as a supplementary method that, besides the basic detection of the presence or absence of a tumour, gives additional information about the extent of the neoplasm. For this investigation the patients were divided into 3 groups. The first group of 58 pts (30%) were those with benign gastric lesions, 18 pts with polyps and 40pts with gastric ulcers respectively. The second groups of 64 pts (32.5%) consisted of those with gastric cancer. According to the endosonographic findings this group consisted of 2 subgroups: 45 operable patients and 19 inoperable patients with gastric cancers. The third group consisted of 73 pts (37.5%) who were without any changes in the gastric wall. The endosonographic findings in the first subgroup that underwent surgery were correlated with the final intraoperative stage and pathohistology, and in the second subgroup they were compared with the operative finding during the palliation procedure and the final diagnosis of the additional investigation. All these qualities make this method useful for the diagnosis, control and follow-up of the findings in all of the stadiums of the disease including the post-operative period."

A 61-year-old man who had early gastric cancer associated with GCP underwent a distal gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy. Histological examination showed various histological types of cancer -well differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma- that had developed independently in the mucosal and submucosal layers of the resected specimen. Furthermore, multiple cysts with a single layer of columnar epithelium were present in the submucosa around the cancerous lesions. However, no neoplastic changes were found in those epithelial cells. Helicobacter pylori was detected in the residual stomach 3 months after surgery. Although the mechanism of the relationship between gastric carcinoma and GCPs is obscure, we speculate that repeated erosion and regeneration induced by chronic inflammation causes multicentric carcinogenesis as well as an aberration of the gastric glands. GCPs may be a risk factor for multiple gastric cancer."

Endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor-like lesion with central ulceration. The lesion was the suspected cause of the anemia; therefore, a partial resection of the stomach was performed. The histopathologic examination revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma (MUC). The tumor extended to the submucosa. Accordingly, a subtotal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection was performed.

We evaluated the clinicopathologic features and prognosis including overall survival of NEC of the esophagus. We identified 40 patients with esophageal NEC from our institutional database. All cancers had been clinically staged using endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography. Neuroendocrine differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. The NEC component was classified into small-cell and large-cell subtypes, and non-neuroendocrine components were evaluated. Patients with locoregional disease were treated with chemoradiation with or without surgery or with surgery only. Patients with distant metastasis were treated with systemic therapy. The extent of residual tumors was evaluated in esophagectomy specimens after preoperative chemoradiation. Twenty-seven patients had large-cell NEC, and 13 had small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. An adenocarcinoma component was present in 15 patients and squamous carcinoma component in 1 patient. Synaptophysin was positive in all cases, and chromogranin was positive in 31 cases. Seventeen patients had distant metastasis, and 21 had locoregional disease. Seventeen patients with locoregional disease received preoperative chemoradiation. Disease progressed in 7 patients, and 10 had residual tumor in resection specimens. Overall survival was better with locoregional disease than with distant metastasis (P=0.006). Overall survival was better in patients with non-neuroendocrine component than in patients with pure NEC (P=0.031). There was no difference in prognosis between patients with large-cell NEC and those with small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Esophageal NEC is an aggressive tumor, and patients with mix NEC have better outcome."

Staging currently follows the modified Ann Arbor classification but most likely in the future, the TNM-based Paris staging system will be applied due to its detailed description of the local spread as well as the extraintestinal dissemination. For assessment of gut wall infiltration and local lymphonodular involvement, endoscopic ultrasound currently represents the standard procedure and is an essential diagnostic tool regarding locoregional staging. Additionally, the method confers a high prognostic value regarding treatment response in MALT lymphoma. In endoscopic ultrasound stage EI 1, Helicobacter pylori eradication leads in 70 - 100 % to a complete response. However, the value of endoscopic ultrasound in the follow-up of lymphomas after chemotherapy remains elusive and controversial. There is no clear correlation between histologically proven residual disease and endosonographic results. Thus, so far, endoscopic ultrasound will not replace bioptic surveillance after MALT lymphoma treatment."

The high prognostic and therapeutic relevance of the resulting cytopathological diagnoses necessitates a shared responsibility of endosonographer and cytopathologist. Quality control programs are required. The diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsies depends on the location, size and characteristics of target tissues, and technical factors (i. e., type of needle used, biopsy technique, and material processing). Other weighing factors include training, expertise and interaction of the endosonographer with cytopathologists. On-site cytological evaluation, which has proven to be successful in optimising the diagnostic efficiency of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy, is notably practiced in Northern American and French academic institutions. It seems to be a sensible alternative to collect specimens for histological and immunohistochemical investigations in addition to the cytological smears in consideration of the economic and structural terms in the German health-care system. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration succeeds in harvesting core biopsies in 3 out of 4 cases with 22-gauge needles.

Twenty-three patients with early gastric cancer who underwent SN biopsy were retrospectively evaluated. Based on SN evaluation, individualized surgery was performed in five patients with T1N0M0 gastric cancer. When pathological examination of frozen sections revealed metastasis in SNs, we performed a standard D2 gastrectomy. Laparoscopic local resection was applied when the SN biopsy was negative. Our results showed that the success rate with SN biopsy in early gastric cancer was 100%, as were the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. All five patients with early gastric cancer had SNs negative for metastases both by frozen section and by postoperative pathology. Thus, all these patients underwent laparoscopic local resection without extended lymphadenectomy. We conclude that SN biopsy is a useful tool to individualize the operative procedure, and laparoscopic local resection can be safely performed using SN guidance in selected patients with early gastric cancer."

Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed to resect the tumor completely. The pathological diagnosis was a gastric hamartomatous inverted polyp. The patient was later discharged without any complications. Hamartomatous inverted polyps without a stalk are classified as the SMT type because the tumor is inverted down growth into the submucosal layer, otherwise polyps with a stalk are classified as the polyp type. All of the polyps were resected endoscopically, however, surgical resection was performed for those of the SMT type, because it is difficult to remove this type completely by en-block resection using conventional EMR technique.

Superior loco-regional detail may yield useful staging and prognostic information but information on its accuracy, as compared with computed tomography (CT), remains undefined and limited by small study size. We prospectively studied 109 patients with gastroesophageal cancer; 99 of whom were undergoing surgery. All had EUS and helical CT imaging before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the results were compared with pathological staging of resected specimens. Tumor response was assessed by the reduction in maximal tumor depth at EUS and correlated with patient survival.

EUS responders had a median survival of 38 months compared to 30 months for non-responders (P < 0.05). The identification of lymphadenopathy at radial EUS was not predictive of survival. This large series study demonstrates the staging accuracy of CT and non-biopsy EUS in the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for gastroesophageal cancer to be equivalent and poor.

CD009944,0,18084953,0,Surgical palliation of advanced pancreatic cancer.,"In about 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer surgical resection is not feasible at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, palliative treatment plays a key role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The defined goals of palliative treatment are: reduction of symptoms, reduction of in-hospital stays, and an adequate control of pain. In patients with nonresectable pancreatic carcinoma the leading goal of palliative strategies should be the control of biliary and duodenal obstructions such as jaundice-associated pruritus or sustained nausea and vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction. Although the role of endoscopy for palliation has been increasing, operative palliation is still indicated in selected cases. Obstructive jaundice is found in approximately 70% of patients suffering from carcinoma of the pancreatic head at diagnosis and has to be eliminated to avoid progressive liver dysfunction and liver failure. In up to 50% of patients with pancreatic cancer, clinical symptoms such as nausea and vomiting occur. For the treatment of malignant biliary obstructions in patients with pancreatic carcinoma, endoscopic biliary drainage is the option of first choice. In case of persistent stent-problems such as occlusion or recurrent cholangitis, a hepaticojejunostomy should be considered. The role of a prophylactic gastroenterostomy is still under discussion. In patients with combined biliary and gastric obstruction a combined bypass should be performed to avoid a second operation. The significance of laparoscopic biliary bypass is not yet clear. A surgical, minimally invasive approach for treating bile duct obstruction is not the standard nowadays. The role of surgical pain relief is mostly negligible today. Computed tomography (CT)- or EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis has replaced surgical intervention today. The significance of palliative resections is currently a controversial topic. However, beyond controlled randomized studies, a palliative pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma cannot be recommended at this time."

CD009944,0,18025508,0,PET/CT of esophageal cancer: its role in clinical management.,"Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has important utility and limitations in the initial staging of esophageal cancer, evaluation of response to neoadjuvant therapy, and detection of recurrent malignancy. Esophageal cancer is often treated by using a combined modality approach (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and esophagectomy); correct integration of PET/CT into the conventional work-up of esophageal cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines the information from PET/CT with results of clinical assessment, diagnostic CT, endoscopic gastroduodenoscopy, and endoscopic ultrasonography. PET/CT has limited utility in T staging of esophageal cancer and relatively limited utility in detection of dissemination to locoregional lymph nodes. However, PET/CT allows detection of metastatic disease that may not be identifiable with other methods. PET/CT is not sufficiently reliable in the individual patient for determination of treatment response in the primary tumor. Interpretation of PET/CT results is optimized by understanding the diagnostic limitations and pitfalls that may be encountered, together with knowledge of the natural history of esophageal cancer and the staging and treatment options available."

CD009944,0,17985093,0,Localisation and staging of gastrin producing tumours using cross-sectional imaging modalities.,"Cross sectional imaging in the assessment of gastrinomas has three major applications: Tumor localization (sporadic gastrinoma, MEN I) in patients undergoing primary or secondary surgery. Staging of metastasized tumors, especially assessment of lymph nodes and liver metastases, possibly including a risk analysis prior to liver resection. Post-surgery follow-up and monitoring of bio- or chemotherapy. Detection of primary tumors is strongly correlated with their size. However, the sensitivity of surgical assessment of the mostly small tumors by experienced surgeons is much higher than that of any imaging modality. Of all imaging modalities, endoultrasonography (EUS) followed by Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) is the most sensitive modality for the assessment of pancreatic tumors in asymptomatic patients suffering from a MEN-I syndrome. Scintigraphy has the highest sensitivity in tumors of symptomatic patients and in the assessment of metastases. CT and MRI are only second line diagnostic modalities. Their sensitivity is largely dependent on the selection of patients. As a potential application, 3D reconstruction of nearly isotropic CT data sets for the risk assessment prior to liver resection is currently developing. Due to the absent radiation exposure, MRI is increasingly utilized to monitor the response of metastases under systemic therapy, e.g. in clinical trials."

The exclusion of nodal involvement and the evaluation of the depth of tumor penetration within the gastrointestinal wall is essential to select patients who can benefit from this approach.

CD009944,0,17921945,0,Endoscopic ultrasound and staging of non-small cell lung cancer.,"Accurate cancer staging allows the most favorable therapy and prognosis of a neoplastic process, and allows consistency when performing clinical trials for different stages of tumors. In the case of non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most important parameters for optimal treatment and prognosis are the presence of cancer spread to the lymph nodes within the mediastinum, and to distant organs. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become a significant tool for the assessment of mediastinal lymph nodes, and in some cases, distant organ metastases because of its minimally invasive access to these sites through a trans-esophageal or trans-gastric approach. The capability of performing fine needle aspiration (FNA) has greatly improved the accuracy and popularity of EUS for lung cancer staging.

CD009944,0,17921934,0,Endoscopic ultrasound teaching and learning.,"Scientific publications in the field of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are raising up since the last twenty years. The value of EUS is directly proportional to the training, skill and experience of the endosonographer. In a recent series, the lowest annual number of examinations requested per year might be around 200-250 procedures. For achieving competence in all the fields of EUS, they recommended a minimum of 150 supervised cases, 75 of them being devoted to pancreaticobiliary diseases and 50 to fine needle aspiration (FNA). Many studies have yet confirmed the importance of the learning curve to improve the EUS accuracy. The accuracy of EUS staging of esophageal cancer was significantly improved over an 8-year period for T staging from 64% to 90% but not for N staging. Considering pancreaticobiliary diseases, some series reported the influence of training on accuracy of EUS-guided FNA of pancreatic masses. Even if the exact type and modalities for EUS training remained to be determined, the usefulness of a period of training in a center performing more than 200 procedures per year is confirmed. Improving cognitive EUS learning and technique required theoretical teaching and practical teaching with observation during live demonstration and echoendoscope hands-on in humans with an expert supervision or with different simulator models. In France, formal EUS training has been underway since 1991, with a two-year intensive program including 4 weeks of theoretical training and 20 one-day practical sessions per year. This program was updated in 2004 to include 3 weeks of theoretical course work including numerous video sessions and 1 week of practical sessions. Theoretical courses are given primarily by gastroenterologists and EUS experts, but also by pathologists, surgeons, anatomists and radiologists. Practical sessions include 4 days of live demonstrations and computed-based simulator (EUS mentor; Simbionix, Tel Hashomer, Israel) and one day with a swine model. Simulators, either computed-based simulator, Erlangen model, or live pigs are believed to shorten the learning phase of EUS. The live pig model was chosen for EUS credentialing because it appears to be similar in many respects to the human anatomy, especially for the pancreas, portal and mesenteric vessels, celiac axis, left kidney and spleen. In addition, for trainees, it often appears more exciting and stimulating than virtual model. However, EUS training on a swine model is recognized to be the more expansive way for EUS teaching. Between the pre and post-test, EUS fellows significantly improved their competence for the visualization of anatomical structures i.e. vena cava, mesenteric/splenic vein, celiac axis, pancreas and bile duct. At the end of the day-session, trainees were mostly able to recognize and follow these anatomical structures with both endoscopes. Interventional EUS learning was also assessed. A significant decrease in procedural duration and a significant increase in FNA precision were demonstrated for the puncture of a hilar liver lymph node."

We aimed to determine the additional diagnostic value of alternative staging investigations. We included 569 oesophageal or gastric cardia cancer patients who had undergone CT neck/thorax/abdomen, ultrasound (US) abdomen, US neck, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and/or chest X-ray for staging. Sensitivity and specificity were first determined at an organ level (results of investigations, i.e., CT, US abdomen, US neck, EUS, and chest X-ray, per organ), and then at a patient level (results for combinations of investigations), considering that the detection of distant metastases is a contraindication to surgery. For this, we compared three strategies for each organ: CT alone, CT plus another investigation if CT was negative for metastases (one-positive scenario), and CT plus another investigation if CT was positive, but requiring that both were positive for a final positive result (two-positive scenario). In addition, costs, life expectancy and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared between different diagnostic strategies. CT showed sensitivities for detecting metastases in celiac lymph nodes, liver and lung of 69, 73, and 90%, respectively, which was higher than the sensitivities of US abdomen (44% for celiac lymph nodes and 65% for liver metastases), EUS (38% for celiac lymph nodes), and chest X-ray (68% for lung metastases). In contrast, US neck showed a higher sensitivity for the detection of malignant supraclavicular lymph nodes than CT (85 vs 28%). At a patient level, sensitivity for detecting distant metastases was 66% and specificity was 95% if only CT was performed. A higher sensitivity (86%) was achieved when US neck was added to CT (one-positive scenario), at the same specificity (95%). This strategy resulted in lower costs compared to CT only, at an almost similar (quality adjusted) life expectancy. Slightly higher specificities (97-99%) were achieved if liver and/or lung metastases found on CT, were confirmed by US abdomen or chest X-ray, respectively (two-positive scenario). These strategies had only slightly higher QALYs, but substantially higher costs. The combination of CT neck/thorax/abdomen and US neck was most cost-effective for the detection of metastases in patients with oesophageal or gastric cardia cancer, whereas the performance of CT only had a lower sensitivity for metastases detection and higher costs. The role of EUS seems limited, which may be due to the low number of M1b celiac lymph nodes detected in this series. It remains to be determined whether the application of positron emission tomography will further increase sensitivities and specificities of metastases detection without jeopardising costs and QALYs."

CD009944,0,17679360,0,[The possibilities and barriers in endoscopic examination and treatment of esophagus cancer].,"When it comes to the effective treatment of esophagus tumor is one of the most difficult tumor to treat of all tumors of alimentary tract. It is due to the biological features of this tumor and lack of its early clinical symptoms, which would allow to recognize it in the early stage and to begin with a radical treatment. The main method to recognize the esophagous tumor is the endoscopic treatment with histopathology, and the endosonography is the best method which allows to estimate its local advancement. Endoscopy allows to detect pre-malignant phase and the early stage as well use of the alternative to surgical endoscopic methods of the treatment. Unfortunately, endoscopy made to patients with swallow discordance usually shows the advanced esophagus tumor, which is to be qualified for palliative treatment that include: widening of esophagus, different methods of ablation, endoscopic stenting and implementing alimentary gastrostomy. The choice of the treatment method should be based on the type of the tumor and the advancement stage of disease, but the clinical practice shows that the method of treatment is determined by the availability of the methods and experience. The parallel use of different methods of treatment may give better results, but the wide range of treatment methods shows the lack of optimal way of treatment, on the other hand gives the possibility to chose the individual method of optimal treatment. Surgical treatment is still method of choice in the esophagus tumor, but it is often impossible to perform or is appears to be ineffective and it creates the possibility of use of alternative endoscopic methods. The article shows the possibilities of diagnosing and different endoscopic techniques for radical treatment of earlyphase and palliative treatment of advanced tumor of esophagus."

Endoscopic ultrasound cannot accurately distinguish benign from malignant changes in the primary lesion or lymph node on imaging alone. With the introduction of the curved linear array echoendoscope in the 1990s, the indications for EUS have expanded. The curved linear array echoendoscope enables the visualization of a needle as it exits from the biopsy channel in the same plane of ultrasound imaging in real time. This allows the endoscopist to perform a whole range of interventional applications ranging from fine needle aspiration (FNA) of lesions surrounding the gastrointestinal tract to celiac plexus block and drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst.

CD009944,0,17599290,0,[Current status of ultrasound in gastroenterology--bowel and upper gastrointestinal tract--part 1].,"Ultrasonography has become widely accepted as a diagnostic tool for gastrointestinal diseases. It not only assesses the lumen but more importantly also the wall and the surrounding structures of the stomach and bowel. Furthermore, functional processes (peristalsis, blood flow) can be visualised and provide important information for passage and perfusion. Modern high resolution (compressive) sonography represents an ideal complementary method besides endoscopy for the gastroenterologist. It is used in emergency diagnosis in cases of acute appendicitis and peridiverticulitis. Here sonography is the method of first choice achieving a high sensitivity. The same applies to ileus, which can be diagnosed significantly earlier by sonography than with conventional X-ray methods. Meanwhile sonography can contribute considerable information to clarify pathogenesis (e. g., invagination, intususception). The detection of a perforation depends strongly on the competence of the examiner. The main advantage is the detection of a covered perforation and the genesis (e. g., ulcer). Ultrasound is less commonly considered in celiac sprue but important complementary information can be obtained. Advanced tumours of the gastrointestinal tract can easily be visualised, although early stages can hardly be detected by means of sonography. An accurate T-staging of tumours is not possible with transabdominal sonography, not least because some parts of the bowel (colon and rectum) cannot always and completely be seen. Exclusion of tumour or early detection is not possible by ultrasound. In intestinal diseases additional information besides clinical and endoscopic aspects can be achieved by ultrasound. Sonography is important for differential diagnosis and follow-up and spares the patient from more incriminatory endoscopic operations. Ultrasound is equal to other imaging methods in detecting complications (fistulas, abscess, stenosis). Due to the complexity of the topic the following review will concentrate on giving an idea of the present status of sonography in chronic inflammatory bowel disease, some less frequent intestinal infections (bacterial, pseudomembranous, neutropenic colitis, intestinal tuberculosis), the ischaemic bowel diseases as well as diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract."

No more treatment was carried out because it was classified as a very low risk gastrointestinal stromal tumour according to Fletcher's classification. After 34 months follow-up, the patient is disease free and we believe that endoscopic treatment is sufficient and recommended for mainly intragastric growing gastrointestinal stromal tumour with a diameter of less than 3 cm."

Successful endoluminal management can be enhanced using endoscopic or ultrasound tools that help predict the degree of sm invasion. Previous studies addressing invasive depth estimation using high-magnification chromoscopic colonoscopy showed a low specificity for deep sm layer 3 invasion with miniprobe ultrasound demonstrating better nodal and T stage in vivo prediction. High-resolution vascular mapping of lesions can show microvascular superficial changes that may predict sm invasive disease.

The pathological examination revealed that the lesion, measuring 45 mm x 35 mm, was an inverted hyperplastic polyp (IHP) located in the submucosal layer and consisting mostly of columnar cells resembling foveolar epithelium and pyloric gland cells. Notably, adenocarcinoma with adjacent dysplasia was observed in the submucosal glands. Transition from hyperplasia to dysplasia and from dysplasia to adenocarcinoma was noted. The adenocarcinoma component was intensely and diffusely positive for p53 overexpression, while the dysplasia component showed only weak and focal positivity, suggesting a role of p53 mutation in the dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. Gastric IHP is very rare, and only 31 cases (in 29 patients) have been reported. Five of these IHPs coexisted with gastric adenocarcinomas, which had all developed separately from the IHP lesions.

Duodenoscopy revealed an ulcerated tumor in the posterior wall of the second portion of the duodenum and the malignancy was confirmed by a biopsy. He underwent a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with a regional lymph node dissection. The histological diagnosis was mucinous carcinoma of the duodenum with lymph node metastasis. High-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) was identified in both the colon and a duodenal specimen based on a microsatellite assay. A germline mutation in the hMSH2 gene was also identified. Even though extracolonic malignancies are associated with HNPCC, duodenal cancer is nevertheless very rare, and only two cases have been reported over the past 20 years.

CD009944,0,17069596,0,Multiple giant leiomyomas of the esophagus and stomach.,"Leiomyomas are rare esophageal disorders, although among the benign esophageal neoplasms, they are the most common. Multiple leiomyomas are distinguished from esophageal leiomyomatosis, an extremely rare condition, which is associated with Alport syndrome, showing deletions and rearrangements of the COL4A5/COL4A6 gene. There are only a few reports of diffuse multilocular lesions. A 19-year-old man presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and diffuse abdominal pain. On endoscopy multiple nodules covered with intact mucosa were present, the largest tumor arising from the gastro-esophageal border infiltrating the cardia. Barium swallow demonstrated narrowing of the middle and lower esophagus with the upper third of the stomach filled by the tumor. Thorax and abdominal CT scans revealed infiltration of almost the total aboral esophagus by the tumor with compression of left and right bronchi. The infiltration reached the whole lesser curvature of the stomach. Endosonography showed multiple encapsulated nodules. Due to the extended tumor growth with infiltration of the upper third of the stomach, a total esophago-gastrectomy with reconstruction by colon interposition was performed. On histopathological examination multiple esophageal leiomyomas with infiltration of the proximal third of the stomach was shown. Immunohistochemically the tumor stained positive for desmin and sm-actin and negative for CD34 and c-kit. Genetic analysis ruled out a deletion of the COL4A5/COL4A6 locus on chromosome X that is linked with Alport syndrome-diffuse leiomyomatosis. Extended mutations in the COL4A5 gene, associated with Alport syndrome, to the COL4A6 gene, are required for the development of leiomyomatosis. In young patients with diffuse multinodular infiltration by encapsulated tumors, esophageal leiomyomatosis should be considered. If the proximal third of the stomach is infiltrated by the tumor an extended resection is necessary. Reconstruction procedures include colon interposition."

Patients newly diagnosed with gastric or esophageal cancer and who were deemed suitable for surgical resection by the MDT were studied. Patients were staged with a combination of computerized tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS). Additionally, the MDT determined an overall clinical stage for each patient after discussion at the MDT meeting. Treatments were selected according to this final clinical stage. Final histopathological staging (pTNM) was available for all patients and was used as the gold standard for determining staging accuracy. Suitability of treatment selection was assessed once final pTNM was available. One hundred and eighteen patients were studied. Endoscopic ultrasound was the most accurate individual staging modality for the loco-regional assessment of esophageal tumors (T stage accuracy 78%, N stage accuracy 70%). Laparoscopic ultrasound was the most accurate modality in T staging of gastric cancers (91%). The MDT stage was more accurate than each individual staging modality for T and N staging for both gastric and esophageal cancers (accuracy range: 88-89%) and was better for the assessment of nodal disease than each individual modality (CT P < 0.001, EUS P < 0.01, LUS P < 0.01). Overall staging accuracy as determined at the MDT meeting was increased and resulted in only 2/118 (2%) patients being under-treated. The MDT significantly improves staging accuracy for gastro-esophageal cancer and ensures that correct management decisions are made for the highest number of individual patients."

CD009944,0,16997159,0,The role of surgery in patients with advanced gastric cancer.,"Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment with curative intent for established gastric cancer. Patient selection is critical to achieving satisfactory outcomes, and involves careful assessment of both patient fitness and disease stage. Staging techniques have multiplied and become much more sensitive in recent years. Current best practice involves a combination of spiral CT scan, Endoscopic ultrasound, PET scanning and laparoscopy. Only a minority of patients progress to potentially curative surgery after staging and fitness assessment in Western centres. Conventional treatment involves a distal subtotal gastrectomy or total gastrectomy depending on the site of the lesion. Innovative techniques include the Merendino operation, and pylorus and nerve sparing gastrectomies for earlier stage disease in the proximal and distal stomach, respectively. There is evidence of nutritional and quality of life benefit in the first 2 years after surgery from formation of a gastric substitute reservoir. Laparoscopic resection is well established in Japan and is developing rapidly elsewhere but its role and outcomes are not yet well defined. Radical lymph node dissection remains controversial: randomised trial evidence of overall benefit is lacking, but expert series have produced excellent results, and there are indications of a sub-group benefit for patients with stage II and III disease. The increased morbidity and mortality associated with radical dissection appear to be largely attributable to pancreatic and splenic resection together with limitations in Unit expertise. Surgical palliation has become less important in recent years as interventional radiology and endoscopy techniques have been developed for the same purposes. Overall mortality and survival results have improved dramatically over the last 20 years, but interpretation of these figures is made difficult by major changes in staging and case selection. The chances of long-term survival are, however, clearly much greater, and those of peri-operative death much less for an individual patient accepted for surgery in 2006 than they would have been in 1986."

If a patient with oesophageal carcinoma is eligible for treatment with curative intent, they should undergo thoracic and abdominal CT, ultrasound investigation of the supraclavicular region and endoscopic ultrasonography for staging purposes. Endoscopic therapy is the preferred treatment for high-grade dysplasia or early cancer in Barrett's oesophagus confined to the mucosa. Surgical resection is indicated if the tumour invades the submucosa. If resection of the oesophageal carcinoma is performed with curative intent, one should aim for radical resection. The type and extent of the resection depends on the location of the tumour. There is evidence that the mortality rate following surgery can be reduced by performing it in centres with ample experience with oesophageal cancer surgery. Preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy may improve survival in patients with oesophageal carcinoma. Palliative treatment for oesophageal carcinoma should be considered in cases of local invasion of surrounding organs, metastases, poor physical condition of the patient or recurrent disease after previous curative treatment.

Therefore, it is necessary to reliably identify patients who might benefit from major surgical intervention by employing the appropriate staging methods. In this review, the pros and cons of each imaging technique are discussed and an algorithm for single and combined use of the different imaging modalities is proposed. To date, contrast-enhanced multi-detector row helical CT (MDR-CT) together with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) remain the first staging methods of choice. MDR-CT has a high sensitivity for identifying vascular invasion and EUS is able to detect lesions as small as 2-3 mm. ERCP is performed mainly in patients with biliary obstruction with the option for therapeutic intervention during the same session. MRI with MR-angiography, MRCP, PET/CT and staging laparoscopy are additional modalities which might give further information in cases of equivocal findings by MDR-CT and EUS. The role of tumour markers such as CA 19-9 and CEA is reserved for monitoring and diagnosing post-surgery recurrence. Cytological or histological confirmation should usually be performed in patients that are not eligible for surgery prior to the commencement of palliative radio- or chemotherapy. In the routine clinical setting, MDR-CT and EUS play the predominant roles by providing the most cost-effective and accurate means for diagnosing and staging most cases of pancreatic cancer."

There is no consensus about the surgical management of these small tumors, although this clinical issue is crucial because some of the tumors show unexpected malignant behavior. In this study, we evaluated the clinical management of patients with gastric GISTs who underwent surgical resection. Altogether, 31 patients with gastric GISTs were examined retrospectively. Surgical resection was fundamentally indicated for the patients with gastric GISTs suspected to be malignant by endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). The malignant grade of the GISTs was evaluated by the mitotic rate, tumor size, and MIB-1 index. EUS was useful for differentiating benign from malignant GISTs; but by limiting the study to patients with small tumors (< 3 cm), the diagnostic value of EUS was not satisfactory for defining the surgical indication. Tumors that were < 50 mm were successfully treated by laparoscopic surgery. Of the 31 patients, 4 had a relapse of the disease, and 1 of those 4 patients had a small tumor (30 mm). All of the recurrences were classified in the high risk category. Surgery is indicated for gastric GISTs that are > or = 20 mm or are suspected to be malignant based on EUS findings. Laparoscopic resection is feasible and is recommended as the treatment of choice for patients with tumors < 50 mm. Risk assessment can be most useful for predicting recurrence."

We report two cases of early gastric cancer and we specify the clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic aspects of the disease. This study is about two female patients, respectively, 36 and 70 years old. The diagnosis of early gastric cancer was based on pathologic examination of the resected stomach. The two patients are in remission 2 years and 6 months later, respectively. The diagnosis of early gastric cancer is often made on nonspecific symptoms. Oeso-gastro-duodenoscopy shows gastric mucosal anomalies. Pathologic examination of gastric biopsies confirm the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic ultrasound is essential; it specifies the submucosal infiltration and evaluates the lymph node invasion. Surgery is the primary treatment but in some cases endoscopic mucosal resection provides good long-term results. Early diagnosis of adenocarcinoma improves the prognosis of the disease, which remains poor nowadays."

CD009944,0,16350723,0,[Diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties in MEN 1 syndrome].,"MEN 1 syndrome (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by the association of tumors in several endocrine glands, mainly in parathyroids, gut and pituitary. At our institution in the years 1982-2004 we have followed 26 patients with MEN 1 syndrome belonging to 19 families. The diagnosis of MEN 1 was based on Gubbio Consensus (JCEM 86: 5658-5671, 2001). Mean age at the diagnosis of MEN 1 was 35 years. Primary hyperparathyroidism was the most frequent pathology, which was diagnosed in 25 of 26 patients (96%). Gut endocrine tumors were found in 20 patients (77%), while pituitary tumors in 18 (70%). Non-functioning gut tumors were most frequent (n=9), followed by insulinoma (n=7) and gastrinoma (n=4). Prolactinoma was the most frequent pituitary tumor found in 12 patients (67%). Three patients died during the observation period - all of them of generalized gut endocrine tumor (gastrinoma in 2 cases and foregut carcinoid in one case). The management of MEN 1 is not easy and careful analysis of clinical picture is necessary in each individual case. Several important observations can be made on the basis of own experience and the literature: 1. In each sporadic pathology, which may be a part of MEN 1, one should consider. the possibility of MEN 1. The individual MEN 1 abnormalities are often diagnosed after 40 and later 2. MEN 1 tumor are usually multiple thus necessitating a different therapeutic approach (more radical surgery) 3. The most valuable screening tests are: Ca++, PP, CgA and prolactin 4. Endoscopic ultrasound is the most specific method for the localization of pancreatic endocrine tumors. 5. The results of surgical treatment of MEN 1 tumors are worse than that of sporadic tumors. 6. Prognosis in MEN 1 is determined by the behaviour of gut neuroendocrine tumor 7. No genotype/phenotype correlation in MEN 1 syndrome was found so far. In summary, it should be underlined that MEN 1 syndrome is an endocrine disorder, in which early diagnosis and optimal treatment may significantly improve the prognosis."

CD009944,0,16253903,0,Pancreatic tumours as part of the MEN-1 syndrome.,"Pancreaticoduodenal tumours (PETs) occur in a majority of MEN-1 patients, and have appeared as a major cause of disease-related death. Previous discussions about treatment have mainly dealt with management of various functioning tumours and clinical syndromes of hormone excess. However, hormonal syndromes often occur late with MEN-1 pancreatic tumours, and when developed indicate presence of metastases in up to 50% of the patients. Prospective screening is therefore recommended in MEN-1 with biochemical markers and endoscopic ultrasound for early detection of PETs, and early surgery before metastases have developed. Surgery is recommended in patients with or without hormonal syndromes in absence of disseminated liver metastases. The suggested operation includes enucleation of tumours in the head of the pancreas, excision of duodenal gastrinomas together with clearance of lymph node metastases, and distal 80% subtotal pancreatic resection as prophylaxis against tumour recurrence. This strategy with early and aggressive surgery is believed to reduce the risks for malignant progression."

Therapeutic algorithms are proposed depending mainly on analogous TNM categories and grading considering conventional and experimental surgical and non-surgical therapy. Colonic neuroendocrine tumours are often misdiagnosed as undifferentiated adenocarcinoma and are therefore not properly treated with adjuvant and additive chemotherapy. As most rectal neuroendocrine tumours are benign because of submucosal extension only, the size and infiltration depth correlates with lymph-node and distant metastases and therefore with the prognosis. It is unknown whether endoscopic ultrasound can improve the diagnostic accuracy compared to size-related conclusions, and therefore whether it can change therapeutic strategies and improve survival by modern rectal surgery."

In addition to recent cases immediately diagnosed as GISTs, a pathological review of stored material from non-epithelial tumors of the gastrointestinal tract operated on over the past 20 years was performed. Twenty-three out of a total of 31 cases were shown to be positive for the immunophenotypic characteristics (CD117/CD34) of GISTs. Most cases (approximately 60%) were symptomatic, with hemorrhage being the most common presenting sign, followed by occlusion, pain and perforation. Asymptomatic cases were detected incidentally during procedures for other conditions. Diagnostic techniques (ultrasound, endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, X-ray, CT, MRI) allowed only the detection of wall (extraluminal) involvement. Apart from differentiating between benign and malignant, preoperative biopsy was seldom valuable. All cases were treated surgically, with intervention tailored to location and anatomical/surgical and anatomical/pathological features. Long-term follow-up was conducted in all patients and for most is still ongoing: five patients died from recurrent disease at varying intervals after surgery (from 17 to 102 months). Relationships between observed aggressiveness and risk were studied. Parameters that may prove useful for the early detection and appropriate management of these lesions are discussed."
CD009944,0,16193595,0,Diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastatic to mediastinal lymph nodes by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy.,"We report the case of a patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who was diagnosed as having metastasis in mediastinal lymph nodes and successfully underwent systemic chemotherapy without surgery. A 61-year-old male with a history of nasopharyngeal carcinoma presented with odynophagia. Examination revealed two palpable lymph nodes in the right neck. Pharyngoscopy showed a mass in the left inferior pharyngeal mucosa, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed only chronic gastritis, with no sign of esophageal disease. Chest CT confirmed the presence of a non-enhancing 20-mm soft tissue mass in the paraesophageal area, with increased attenuation compared with the adjacent esophagus. To evaluate this lesion we applied endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA). Two passes were made with a 21-gauge fine needle and the patient tolerated the procedure well, without complications. Cytological findings were compatible with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from a nasopharyngeal tumor, and the clinical stage was determined as T3N2bM1 (stage IVC) because of mediastinal lymph node metastasis. We thus determined the nodal status of a head and neck tumor by means of EUS-FNA. In conclusion, EUS-FNA is a safe and reliable technique for evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and is especially valuable for head and neck tumors with suspected metastasis."

Part 1: Stomach, oesophagus and colon.","Primary gastrointestinal lymphomas are most common in the stomach, followed by small intestine and then colon. The most frequently used pathology classification of lymphomas is the Revised European and American Lymphoma /World Health Organization classification. The correlation of radiological morphology with histology is relatively poor, although characteristic subtypes will be discussed. In the stomach, the majority of primary lymphomas are of B-cell origin of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type. Low-grade MALT lymphomas are associated with Helicobacter pylori infection and often respond to eradication of this organism. Radiological features include thickened folds, nodularity, depressed lesions, ulcers, prominent areae gastricae. High-grade (large B-cell) tumour patterns include infiltrative, polypoid, nodular, ulcerated or a combination. Endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound and CT are important in diagnosis and staging, although appearances on barium studies should be recognized. Primary colonic lymphomas are rare. Most are of B-cell origin. Focal and diffuse forms are seen, the former producing polypoid or nodular or cavitating masses and the latter producing ulcerative or nodular (polyposis) patterns on imaging. Even when circumferential, lymphoma rarely causes obstruction. Small bowel lymphomas will be discussed in the forthcoming part 2 of this review."
CD009944,0,16166979,0,Gastric cancer.,"Gastric cancer is a very challenging malignancy given that it presents late, has complex pathogenetic mechanisms with multiple carcinogenic processes implicated, and is only moderately sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation. Accurate staging for gastric cancer is possible with the availability of sophisticated imaging studies, endoscopic ultrasound, and laparoscopy. Postoperative chemoradiation is the standard of care in high-risk patients with resected primary disease. Recent encouraging results with the preoperative approach need to be studied further and prospectively compared to postoperative chemoradiation. Chemotherapy has yielded better results than best supportive care for metastatic gastric cancer and also improves quality of life, although all of these studies included a small number of patients. The last decade has seen newer agents used alone or in combination, with promising results. We anticipate that improved trial design, availability of molecular techniques, and continued search for better cytotoxic and targeted agents will help develop better treatments for patients with advanced gastric cancer."

CD009944,0,16138769,0,[Current diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer].,"Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (pancreatic cancer) is the most frequent tumor entity in the pancreas. While the results of surgical therapy of pancreatic cancer were disappointing in the past due to high perioperative mortality rates, resection of pancreatic cancer nowadays represents the standard treatment for non-metastatic cancer with a mortality rate below 5%. This decrease in perioperative mortality of the Whipple operation is inversely correlated to the case load of the hospital and the responsible surgeon, and is mainly related to improvements in the intensive care management, the surgical technique and patient selection. In particular, the perioperative use of octreotide resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of pancreatic fistula. Furthermore, modern staging examinations such as diagnostic laparoscopy, PET, or endoscopic ultrasound resulted in improved patient selection. In addition, the long-term results of the surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer has been improved by adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the past 10 years. Similar progress has been made in the palliative treatment of metastatic or locally advanced cancer. Nowadays, endoscopic procedures can replace surgical palliation of obstructive jaundice in most cases and sometimes even gastric outlet obstruction. Moreover, systemic chemotherapy using gemcitabine-based protocols has resulted in a significant prolongation of survival. However, further progress in the treatment of pancreatic cancer can only be achieved by an interdisciplinary management of this disease."

Two patients, a 56-year-old woman and a 60-year-old man, were admitted to our department for the treatment of a large submucosal tumor of the stomach. After gastrointestinal endoscopy, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, we suspected that the masses, measuring 7.0 cm and 8.0 cm in diameter, respectively, were GISTs in the stomach. However, preoperatively, we could not rule out the possibility of malignant neoplasms, because they had been bleeding or gradually growing. Hand-assisted laparoscopic wedge resection was safely performed for the diagnosis and treatment of the submucosal tumor of the stomach. The immunohistochemical diagnosis in both patients was GIST of the stomach with intermediate-grade malignancy. HALS may be a good indication for large GISTs of the stomach that are difficult to diagnose preoperatively, whether they are malignant or benign, because it is safe and minimally invasive, promoting rapid recovery."

Radiographic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract disclosed a nodule with central depression in the lower esophagus. By endoscopy the nodule was yellowish and appeared submucosal. Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated a hypoechoic solid tumour limited in submucosa without lymph node involvement. Endoscopic resection using band ligation was performed under guidance by endoscopic ultrasonography. By histologic examination the tumour consisted of large cells arranged in nests. These cells had abundant granular cytoplasm and small round nuclei. They expressed S-100 protein and were CD68, and periodic acid-Schiff positive. No expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin was noted. The tumour was limited in submucosa. Findings were consistent with complete endoscopic resection.

CD009944,0,16001347,0,Giant fold gastritis with consecutive gastric carcinoma in a patient with peutz-jeghers syndrome.,"We describe the case of a 36-year-old patient with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and a very unusual gastric morphology resembling giant fold gastritis. The latter lacked additional features of Menetrier's syndrome, was not influenced by eradication of Helicobacter pylori and persisted for more than ten years under regular endoscopic surveillance. Histologically, foveolar hyperplasia was found in the enlarged folds. Endoscopic ultrasound documented a hyperechoic widening of the gastric mucosa without involvement of the deeper layers. However, despite annual control gastroscopies, an adenocarcinoma developed between the folds and was in an already advanced stage at diagnosis (UICC III). We suggest that a variant of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome may be characterised by marked foveolar hyperplasia similar to Menetrier disease, and that not conventional endoscopy alone, but rather endoscopic ultrasound may be considered in such patients."
CD009944,0,15990940,0,Curative endoscopic ultrasound-assisted submucosal resection of a gastric stromal tumor.,"Endoscopic submucosal resection has been proposed as a feasible alternative for the diagnosis and treatment of small submucosal tumors (< 3 cm), as compared to classic interventions (surgical intervention or frequent follow-up). Therapeutic options should be established after precise endoscopic ultrasound assessment of the tumor characteristics. We present the case of a 60 year-old patient, admitted to the Emergency Department for upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Upper GI endoscopy showed a submucosal tumor on the posterior gastric wall, with hyperemic covering mucosa, without central ulceration. Endoscopic ultrasound identified a 10-mm well-delimited hypoechoic lesion, with the origin in the third hyperechoic layer (submucosa). After injection of 1:10000 epinephrine in the submucosa, with subsequent elevation of the protrusive formation, we performed an endoscopic submucosal resection without any complications. Pathology exam showed a gastric stromal tumor with low mitotic activity, the endoscopic resection being considered curative. The absence of independent risk factors determined by ultrasound endoscopy (size > 3 cm, irregular margins, hyperechoic foci > 3 mm, cystic spaces > 4 mm, presence of intratumoral Doppler signal), as well as the low mitotic activity, permitted the subsequent follow-up of the patient. A control endoscopic examination performed after 4 weeks showed the healing of the post-resection ulceration. In conclusion, ultrasound endoscopy allowed the establishment of a correct presumptive diagnosis and the subsequent assistance of endoscopic submucosal resection, used for pathological confirmation and for curative endoscopic treatment."

We report a rare case of MALT-lymphoma, invading all of the gastric wall, which regressed after eradication of H. pylori. The regression was well documented by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). A 70-year-old man was referred to us for upper endoscopy that showed a single ulcer of 3cm in diameter at the gastric angulus. Histology, immunohistochemistry and PCR analyses diagnosed a low-grade MALT-lymphoma in the presence of H. pylori infection. EUS showed a tumor invasion of all the gastric wall. The serosa layer, also, appeared irregular and interrupted in some points. The lymph nodes around the duodenum and the stomach were not involved. An anti-H. pylori therapy was started. After 1 year from the diagnosis, EUS showed the reappearance of the normal layers of the stomach. The patient is actually disease free. This result suggests that in EI2-stage gastric lymphoma of MALT type, in the absence of both high-grade malignancy foci and t(11;18)(q21;q21) chromosomal translocation, an eradication treatment may be considered as a first therapeutic option."

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a unique type of extranodal lymphoma which is associated with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). The development of low-grade MALT lymphoma of stomach is dependent on H. pylori. A transformed clone carrying the translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) forms a MALT lymphoma, the growth of which is independent of H. pylori and will not respond to bacterial eradication. And inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes, p53 can lead to high-grade transformation. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is essential to document the extent of disease and is superior to CT scan in the detection of spread to perigastric lymph nodes and follow-up EUS may determine the response to therapy and detect the relapse in early phase. Lesions that are confined to the mucosa or submucosa of gastric wall can be successfully treated with H. pylori eradication. Those low-grade MALT lymphomas that are not H. pylori positive or do not respond to antibiotic therapy can be treated with surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Follow-up is critical in all patients who have been treated with H. pylori eradication and consists of multiple endoscopic biopsies and EUS."
CD009944,0,15894867,0,The emerging role of endoscopic ultrasonography in cancer staging.,"The management of solid organ cancers relies on accurate staging. Once distal metastasis has been excluded by conventional radiographic methods, local staging of the tumor and its nodal involvement is essential to determine the most optimal therapeutic approach. Many radiographic imaging modalities are unable to determine subtle tumor involvement. However, the emergence of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has given promise to improved staging with its unique ability to examine tumors from within the gastrointestinal lumen with extremely close proximity. An additional advantage is the ability to perform fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy to confirm or exclude tumor involvement. Many studies have shown superior accuracy in staging with EUS and EUS-FNA for tumors of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, rectum, and mediastinum, including lung cancer. This review illustrates the principles of EUS and its role in staging of a variety of cancers and particularly its role alongside other imaging modalities."

Both patients were positive for H. pylori, and later received H. pylori eradication therapy. The disease has not recurred after 11 and 6 months, respectively.

Recently, minimally invasive surgical procedures for benign gastric conditions have been advocated, and the laparoscopic approach is noted as a technique that increases the quality of life. However, the development of laparoscopic gastric resections and laparoscopically assisted gastric operations for malignancy still deserve a word of caution. Laparoscopic local resection of the stomach is used to treat mucosal cancer without lymph node metastasis, and laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy is used to treat early gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis in the perigastric portion. According to short-term results reported by a small group of surgeons, laparoscopic approaches for gastric cancer result in a minimally invasive approach, early recovery, and decreased morbidity and mortality. However, the longterm results of these less invasive treatments are not known in advanced gastric cancer. If the results of randomized controlled studies for advanced gastric cancer are confirmed, the use of these techniques will spread worldwide and may become a standard technique for the resection of gastric cancer."

CD009944,0,15773837,1,Endoscopic ultrasound for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer: Impact of increased use of primary neoadjuvant therapy on preoperative locoregional staging accuracy.,"Initial treatment of locally advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) malignancies for selected patients at some institutions has recently changed from surgical resection to neoadjuvant therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of this change in treatment strategy on both the overall disease profile and locoregional endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) staging accuracy for a cohort of patients managed with primary surgical resection over a 10-year period at our institution. All subjects at our institution who underwent primary esophagectomy from 1993 to 2002 following preoperative EUS for known or suspected esophageal and/or GEJ cancers were identified. Patients with dysplasia alone, prior upper gastrointestinal tract surgery, preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, cancer of the gastric cardia or recurrent malignancy were excluded. EUS findings and staging results were compared to surgical pathology following resection. The impact of the gradually increased use of primary chemoradiation during the second half of the study was assessed. Of the 286 operations performed, 184 subjects were excluded. The remaining 102 underwent primary surgical resection a median of 18 days following EUS staging for adenocarcinoma (88%) or squamous cell carcinoma (12%) of the esophagus (69%) or GEJ (31%). Overall EUS locoregional T and N staging accuracy was 72% and 75% respectively; accuracy for T1, T2, T3 and T4 cancer was 42%, 50%, 88% and 50% respectively. Despite an increased frequency of pathologically confirmed T1 and T2 cancers (P = 0.005) and an insignificant trend toward increased N0 malignancy (P = 0.05) during the second half of the study period, no statistically significant changes in T (P = 0.07) or N (P = 0.82) staging accuracies for EUS or disease characteristics were noted between the first and second half of the study period. Despite both inaccurate radial EUS staging and increased relative use of primary surgery for early cancers, recent increased use of primary neoadjuvant therapy did not change overall disease characteristics and accuracy of locoregional EUS staging of esophageal and GEJ cancers managed with primary surgical resection."
CD009944,0,15772477,0,Gastric cancer mimicking a submucosal tumor diagnosed by laparoscopic excision biopsy.,"We report a case of advanced gastric cancer exhibiting the features of a submucosal tumor (SMT) of the gastric body. The patient was a 50-year-old male in whom a gastric SMT was detected during a mass screening examination. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a protuberant tumor, 2 cm in diameter, covered with normal-appearing mucosa. Examination of an endoscopic biopsy specimen of the tumor revealed chronic gastritis with regenerative and erosive changes. An endoscopic ultrasound examination demonstrated a hypoechoic mass in the third layer of the gastric wall. The clinical diagnosis was gastric SMT, and the patient's course was monitored. Twenty-six months after the initial visit to our hospital, an endosonograph-guided biopsy revealed Group III (borderline lesion). Three months after the biopsy, the size of the SMT had increased slightly. Laparoscopic wedge resection of the tumor was performed to make a pathologic diagnosis and we were able to make a diagnosis of gastric lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma intraoperatively. Gastrectomy with lymph node dissection was followed as curative surgery. Laparoscopic total excision biopsy is a useful technique in patients with a gastric SMT whose diagnosis has not been confirmed pathologically."
CD009944,0,15758616,0,EUS in the management of the patient with dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus.,"Barrett's esophagus is the most important risk factor in the development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is generally regarded as the most significant complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Adenocarcinoma occurs more frequently in the setting of high-grade dysplasia. The prognosis of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is strongly correlated with the stage of disease. The prognosis of late stage disease is extremely poor. Cure may be achieved when disease is found at an early stage. Esophagectomy has been the definitive treatment of limited stage adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The morbidity and mortality rate for esophagectomy is high. Therefore, alternative endoscopic methods for curative treatments have gained popularity. The two main endoscopic therapies, photodynamic therapy and endoscopic mucosal resection, are both effective when applied to early-stage disease. Traditional evaluation of the patient with Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia includes esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy and computed tomography of the chest. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has gained popularity in the evaluation of the patient with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia because it is the only imaging technique capable of delineating the separate histologic layers of the gastrointestinal tract. The principal role of EUS in evaluating patients with Barrett's-associated dysplasia is to identify patients who may be candidates for endoscopic ablative (endoscopic mucosal resection, photodynamic therapy) therapies. EUS has been shown to be superior to computed tomography (including high resolution spiral CT) or magnetic resonance imaging for preoperative staging in patients with high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma. This review of the literature summarizes the ability of EUS to evaluate patients with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia."

CD009944,0,15657854,0,Diagnosis of esophagogastric tumors.,"With regard to esophageal tumors, important reports on several topics have been published recently. 1) The place of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) as the best locoregional staging technique for cancer of the esophagus has been further consolidated. The addition of fine-needle aspiration makes EUS more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) and more accurate than CT or EUS alone for nodal staging. 2) High-resolution endoscopy with chromoendoscopy has been found to be very effective for mucosal lesions, but not for submucosal lesions. In combination with EUS, the sensitivity for submucosal tumors increases up to 60 %. 3) Autofluorescence-guided biopsy has been reported to be a good tool for detecting high-grade dysplasia. A narrow-band imaging system improved the overall accuracy for depth of invasion. 4) The incidence of hypopharyngeal cancer increases after resection for esophageal carcinoma. Patients with a scattered staining pattern after application of Lugol's solution are more prone to develop upper lesions. 5) Fluorescence imaging makes it possible to detect low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia in Barrett's mucosa, with fewer biopsies. 6) Patients with Barrett's esophagus with a length of over 3 cm had a significantly greater prevalence of dysplasia in comparison with those in the whom the Barrett's segment was shorter than 3 cm (23 % vs. 9 %, P = 0.0001). With regard to gastric tumors, 1) Helicobacter pylori eradication can significantly reduce the development of gastric cancer, but only in patients without precancerous lesions. 2) Intestinal metaplasia types II and III have been shown to have a higher rate of progression to low-grade dysplasia than type I. 3) With regard to screening in asymptomatic individuals, serum pepsinogen may represent an alternative to conventional fluoroscopy methods. 4) In patients who have undergone esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, annual follow-up endoscopies are vital for detecting early secondary gastric cancer and ulcerations in which curative treatment is possible. 5) High-resolution endoscopy allows more precise diagnosis of early gastric cancer. The presence of irregular minute vessels and variations in vessel caliber were found to be specific of early gastric cancer. The small regular pattern of sulci and ridges was observed significantly more frequently in differentiated carcinoma than in undifferentiated carcinoma. 6) Infrared-ray electronic endoscopy combined with indocyanine green injection appears to be effective in detecting sentinel nodes that contain metastases in patients with gastric cancer. 7) Gastric adenocarcinoma was found to show specific changes in the fluorescence spectra emitted, in comparison with normal gastric mucosa. However, there was wide variation in the emitted autofluorescence spectra in gastric cancer with signet-ring cells in comparison with normal mucosa."

However, due to limitations of space, this review will focus only on a few articles selected for their importance and originality. The studies presented deal either with the outcome of EUS--i. e., its real importance in affecting the choices physicians are faced with in their clinical work--or definitively clarify certain technical issues that have often been a matter of debate at EUS meetings.

CD009944,0,15756395,0,Ampullary tumors: endoscopic versus operative management.,"Most ampullary adenomas (80%) are common benign ampullary tumors; however, they can range from mild dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. They are considered premalignant lesions found in the setting of familial polyposis syndromes or found sporadically, usually manifested by vague abdominal pain, liver enzyme elevation, jaundice, recurrent pancreatitis, or with uncommon symptoms such as gastrointestinal bleeding or duodenal obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biopsy is a minimally invasive technique used to visualize these tumors directly and to evaluate their histologic characteristics. Definitive treatment primarily depends on these histologic results. Local resection has a high rate of recurrence (5% to 30%) and requires postoperative endoscopic surveillance, which is the reason it is not considered as a first choice in the management of ampullary tumors. The operative mortality is 10% or less for pancreaticoduodenectomy, a procedure of choice at most experienced centers for frank carcinoma, foci papillary adenocarcinoma in pre-excisional biopsies, or high-grade dysplasia ampullary adenomas. Endoscopic interventions for presumed benign ampullary adenomas have resolved symptoms of obstruction, but long-term follow up is necessary to detect early malignant transformation. In summary, the choice of treatment depends on level of surgical skill available, patient tolerance of long-term endoscopic surveillance versus radical surgery, and the presence or absence of coexisting familial adenomatous polyposis."

CD009944,0,15630987,0,[Surgical treatment of early adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's oesophagus].,"Endoscopy with biopsy, endoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) are prerequisites for an exact preoperative staging of patients with oesophageal cancer. Diagnosing an early adenocarcinoma limited to the mucosa (pT1m), the risk of lymph node metastase is nearly zero. Therefore, consideration could be given to ablate endoscopically the metaplastic mucosa including the pT1m-area. On the other hand, an adenocarcinoma that is invading into the submucosa (pTlsm) has an 18 to 50% likelihood of associated lymphnode metastases. In these patients with a highly curable form of oesophageal cancer only oesophageal resection with systematic abdominal and mediastinal lymph node dissection represents the standard of care. This seems to be also true for more advanced tumours without or with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Because of substantial complications and long-term side effects the need for extensive resection in patients with early tumour stage (pT1) or down staged 'early' carcinoma (yT1) is questionable. Therefore, a limited resection of distal oesophagus and proximal stomach with two-field lymphadenectomy and jejunal interposition is an attractive alternative in early Barrett's carcinoma providing a low morbidity and mortality and resulting in a more than 90% chance of cure, perhaps in successfully down staged yT1-patients as well. Therefore, the extent of oesophageal resection should be tailored to the patient and the known extent of tumour disease. Although, there is no clear evidence at present that RCTx prolongs survival in patients with potentially resectable oesophageal cancer, preoperative treatment appears to increase the chance for a curative resection. Generally, in case of a T4-tumour or distant metastasis a surgical treatment is not indicated."

By endoscopic ultrasonography, SMT was demonstrated as a well-circumscribed, smooth-bordered and hypoechoic mass localized in the submucosal layer. Total gastrectomy was performed. The histology of the resected specimen revealed a gastric lipoma and an early gastric cancer widespread to the surface on the lipoma. Two lesions were present in the same lesion, but not linked.

EWDA may be a gastric counterpart of 'adenoma malignum' or minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) in the uterine cervix; however, the clinicopathological features of EWDA remain less apparent than those of MDA. A 60-year-old male was complaining of dysphagia. He had been made aware of a small submucosal tumor in the cardia 2 years before the onset of this symptom. Endoscopic ultrasonographic examination revealed a large cardiac tumor consisting of thickened layers, as observed in Borrmann type IV. Three mucosal biopsies suggested only benign changes including adenoma and hyperplastic polyps. At the fourth biopsy, cytologically bland columnar cells were located in the submucosa along with stromal fibrosis and laminated stones. The possibility that non-neoplastic aberrant pancreas with lithiasis formed the tumor was denied at laparotomy by a frozen section that revealed benign-looking glands invading the diaphragm. Immunohistochemically the cancer glands were positive for CA19-9 and human gastric mucin, but not for p53 or MUC2. To our knowledge, this is a previously unknown combination of EWDA and psammomatous calcification in the stomach."

The WHO has established an internationally accepted classification of gastrointestinal lymphomas. Although not considered therein, from the clinical point of view a differentiation between low- and high-grade lymphomas would seem to be helpful as the grade of malignancy and stage directly determine the therapeutic strategy. Therefore, a thorough endoscopic-bioptic technique (gastric mapping) and careful clinical staging is necessary. The latter should always include endoscopic ultrasound. Helicobacter pylori represents the decisive causal factor for gastric MALT lymphomas while untreated sprue is an established risk factor for intestinal T cell lymphomas. The therapeutic spectrum ranges from Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy to the well known oncological modalities, namely chemotherapy, radiation or surgery and their combined use. However, also a watch-and-wait strategy may be a good choice in the individual case (minimal residual disease after successful Helicobacter pylori eradication or disseminated stages of indolent lymphomas not offering a curative option)."
CD009944,0,15368107,0,Still any role for transduodenal local excision in tumors of the papilla of Vater?,"Tumors of the papilla and ampulla of Vater are rare neoplasms which are usually detected at an early stage due to their symptoms. The accurate preoperative histological diagnosis and staging of ampullary tumors is often difficult and inconclusive, leading to controversy over the adequate treatment of these lesions. Three procedures are currently being used to treat such tumors. Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is a procedure with low morbidity and mortality at experienced centers, and is considered the treatment of choice for invasive carcinoma and large benign ampullary lesions with suspicion of malignancy. Transduodenal local excision (TDE) of ampullary tumors is a relatively simple procedure with operative morbidity and mortality rates comparable to PD. TDE is challenged at endoscopic centers by endoscopic snare excision (ESE). Due to technical advances, the safety and outcomes of ESE for ampullary tumors have improved in recent years. ESE and TDE represent adequate methods for treatment of benign tumors and also for small malignant tumors detected at an early stage if the diagnosis and stage have been accurately established preoperatively. Due to the safety of PD and the technical advances of ESE, TDE is reserved for selected patients. Randomized controlled studies are needed to establish the correct indications for PD, TDE, and ESE."
CD009944,0,15362758,0,Esophageal intramural spreading from an adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction.,"Although intramural spreading from gastric carcinoma to the esophageal wall is occasionally reported, longitudinal intramural lesion of the esophagus is very rare. We herein report the case of a patient found to have a carcinoma of the gastric cardia with intramural spreading to the esophagus approximately 7.0 cm in length. A 65-year-old man was admitted to our department suffering from a persistent midthoracic pain and mild dysphagia during the previous 3 months. Upper gastrointestinal studies revealed an oval submucosal tumor of the lower esophagus and a flare irregular lesion on the esophagogastric junction. An endoscopic ultrasonography showed the main tumor was in the submucosal layer and invaded beyond the muscularis propria. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen confirmed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 7.0 cm in length, which penetrated through the gastric wall, and invaded the submucosal layer of the esophagus. When only a few scattered carcinoma cells infiltrate only the mucosa or submucosa, it is difficult to diagnose the extent of esophageal invasion. In treating patients with gastric cancer with esophageal invasion, it is important to determine the safety of the proximal margin for esophageal resection. Histological examination using frozen sections obtained during surgery is essential for deciding the operative safety margin."

CD009944,0,15297944,0,Imaging of esophageal and gastric cancer.,"The three major aims of imaging in esophageal and gastric cancer are to distinguish between locoregional and systemic disease (M stage), to determine local tumor extension (T and N stages), and to assess response to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Depending on the applied standard of reference, the sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) for detection of distant metastases ranges between less than 50% to greater than 90%. In esophageal cancer, positron emission tomography with the glucose analog fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) has been shown to detect metastatic disease in approximately 20% of the patients who were considered to have only locoregional disease with CT. In clinical studies, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been shown to differentiate between tumor stages T1/T2 and stages T3/T4 with an accuracy of more than 90%. Accuracy of EUS for differentiating individual tumor stages in routine clinical use has been reported to be markedly lower. Assessment of tumor response by FDG-PET has been shown to correlate with histopathologic tumor regression and patient survival. Furthermore, quantitative measurements of tumor FDG uptake may predict histopathologic tumor response and patient outcome as early as 2 weeks after initiation of preoperative chemotherapy."
CD009944,0,15297943,0,Staging and preoperative evaluation of upper gastrointestinal malignancies.,"Esophageal and gastric cancers are distinct carcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal tract, although the distinction between them becomes less clear at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Increasingly accurate staging is possible based on newer radiographic and surgical techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), laparoscopy and thoracoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). For both cancer types, tumor classification is determined by depth of penetration of the primary tumor into the gastric or esophageal wall. For esophageal cancer, primary tumor anatomic position-upper, mid, and lower esophagus-is used to define the local nodal basin. Metastases in nodes outside the local basin are considered to be distant (M) rather than regional (N). In gastric cancer, the region of nodal metastasis has been abandoned in favor of the number of lymph nodes containing metastasis, which predicts outcome more accurately-patients with more than 15 positive lymph nodes have an outcome comparable to those with M disease. Increasing consideration is being given to the subclassification of tumors near the GEJ into types based on anatomical position, although this staging scheme (""Adenocarcinoma of the EsophagoGastric junction"" or AEG type) has not yet been universally adopted. We review the current pathologic staging systems for esophageal and gastric cancers, the clinical staging approaches for these diseases, and the controversy surrounding classification of tumors of the GEJ."

However, there is growing evidence that micrometastases are present in lymph nodes, which cannot be detected with standard pathological methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether hypermethylation gene promoter analysis was feasible on samples obtained by EUS-FNA from lymph nodes, as well as to establish the usefulness of this strategy for the detection of micrometastases in patients with gastrointestinal and non-small cell lung cancer. Suspicious lymph nodes based on EUS findings from consecutive patients with esophageal, gastric, rectal, and non-small cell lung cancer were sampled by EUS-FNA. Hypermethylation analysis of the MGMT, p16(INK4a), and p14(ARF) gene promoter CpG islands were performed by methylation-specific PCR. Effectiveness of conventional cytology, methylation analysis, and their combination were established with respect to the definitive diagnosis. Twenty-seven patients were included, thus representing a total of 42 lymph nodes (esophageal cancer, n = 11; rectal cancer, n = 7; gastric cancer, n = 3; and lung cancer, n = 21). According to definitive diagnosis, 21 (50%) corresponded to metastatic lymph nodes. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of conventional cytology were 76%, 100%, and 88%, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for the methylation analysis were 81%, 67%, and 74%, respectively. Combination of both techniques increased sensitivity (90%) but decreased specificity (67%) with respect to conventional cytology. In conclusion, it is feasible to detect occult neoplastic cells in EUS-FNA samples by hypermethylation gene promoter analysis. Moreover, addition of methylation analysis to conventional cytology may increase its sensitivity at the expenses of a decrease in its specificity."

We report a patient with a stromal tumor of the esophagus who underwent a thoracoscopic enucleation of the tumor. The patient was a 61-year-old man complaining of slight dysphagia. A submucosal tumor of the middle thoracic esophagus was found endoscopically. The tumor was approximately 4.0 cm in diameter measured by endoscopic ultrasonography. On 17 May 2001, thoracoscopic enucleation of the esophageal tumor was performed using a Kodama Di-suction. The Kodama Di-suction was useful for the thoracoscopic enucleation of the submucosal tumor of the esophagus, acting as both a dissector and a sucker. The patient's course was uneventful after surgery. Histopathologically the esophageal tumor revealed a high cellularity, consisting of spindle cells, and the tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for CD34 and c-kit protein, but not for a-smooth muscle actin or S-100 protein. From these findings, the esophageal submucosal tumor was diagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumor, distinguished from leiomyoma."
CD009944,0,15202101,0,Neoplasms of the esophagus and stomach.,"Esophageal cancer is one of the most lethal of all neoplasms. During the last two decades, there have been significant changes in the epidemiology and treatment of esophageal cancer. The incidence of adenocarcinoma is increasing whereas that of squamous cancer is decreasing. Surgery, the mainstay of treatment of esophageal cancer, has been used with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to improve prognosis in patients with localized disease. Accurate staging is essential for selection of the best mode of therapy and to predict prognosis. In addition, with widespread use of neoadjuvant therapy, accurate assessment of response to therapy has become very important because responders have better a prognosis than nonresponders. Anatomical imaging methods, such as computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasonography, that are commonly used to evaluate esophageal cancer have shortcomings in demonstrating the true extent of disease and in assessing or predicting response to therapy. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) has been shown to be a useful adjunct to anatomical imaging methods. For initial staging of esophageal cancer, the combination of PET and endoscopic ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration biopsy has been suggested to be the most effective strategy. For restaging and monitoring response to therapy, FDG-PET has been shown to be superior to conventional imaging. The incidence of gastric cancer is decreasing worldwide, but it is also a highly lethal cancer. Similar to esophageal cancer, noninvasive staging of this cancer is unsatisfactory. Approximately one-third of the patients thought to have limited disease and to be candidates for surgery by conventional staging methods, are found to have advanced disease at surgery. Only a few published studies have evaluated gastric cancer with FDG-PET. These studies suggest that FDG-PET may be useful in evaluating gastric cancers of intestinal type and nonmucinous tumors."

CD009944,0,15123091,0,Ultrasound-guided endoscopic surgery.,"Ten years' development of sectorial linear endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has allowed us to perform guided biopsies of lymph nodes, mediastinal masses and pancreatic tumours. Furthermore, biopsy guided by EUS has been the first step in the development of interventional EUS. This development, in turn, has been made possible by the appearance of the interventional echoendoscope with a large working channel. EUS-guided biopsy obtains the best results for lymph nodes, anastomotic relapses and extrinsicz compression as well as for pancreatic tumours. Results in the literature show a global sensitivity of the technique that varies between 76 and 91%, a specificity of 84-100% and an accuracy of 78-94%. Using alcohol injection of the plexus nerves, the coeliac block guided by EUS is a simple technique. It will replace percutaneous access under US or CT scan guidance. Data from the literature show a significant reduction in pain of the order of 85-90% of cases-results that would have been good for percutaneous techniques. The technique of cystoenterostomy guided by EUS allows more accurate drainage of the cysts with a lower risk of perforation and haemorrhage. With regard to haemorrhage it should be emphasized that colour Doppler and power Doppler assessment of the punctures rules out the risk of vascular perforation during puncture but the risk of haemorrhage due to decompression of a vascular lesion in the vicinity of the cyst remains. The new ultrasound echoendoscope EG 38X, with a large working channel (3.8 mm), is now available. This system allows more effective drainage and also enables the placement of cystodigestive stents."

It has also proved helpful with the sampling of lymphadenopathy both for the staging of malignancy and for the diagnosis of lymphadenopathy of other causes. We review our experience with EUS-guided FNA of lymph nodes. The cytology files were searched at Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) for all cases of lymph nodes sampled by EUS. Clinical history, biopsy site, diagnosis, and follow-up information (including ancillary testing) were reviewed. Between January 1, 2000 and December 5, 2002, 217 lymph nodes from 185 different patients were sampled by EUS at HCMC. Biopsy sites included 62 mediastinal, 9 paraesophageal, and 146 intra-abdominal lymph nodes. Diagnoses were as follows: metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (n = 69); benign, reactive lymph node (n = 76); granulomatous lymphadenopathy (n = 18); malignant lymphoma (n = 7); atypical-suspicious for malignancy (n = 5); metastatic small cell carcinoma (n = 2); necrotic debris (n = 4), and foreign material (n = 1); 35 cases were nondiagnostic (16.1%) in 22 of 185 patients (11.9%).

The diagnosis of gastric cancer at an early stage (early gastric cancer) represents the only hope for improving survival of these patients. Upper GI endoscopy (including chromoendoscopy and magnifying endoscopy) remains the corner-stone for diagnosis, although other modalities such as endoscopic ultrasonography, conventional radiographs, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and virtual endoscopy, are helpful. Histology always seals the correct diagnosis, and makes the final staging. The experience of the endoscopist is a critical point related to correct diagnosis. Better awareness by endoscopists of the various appearances of early gastric cancer, is mandatory.

CD009944,0,15023013,0,Gastric cancer: diagnosis and treatment options.,"Although the overall incidence of gastric cancer has steadily declined in the United States, it is estimated that more than 12,000 persons died from gastric cancer in 2003. The incidence of distal stomach tumors has greatly declined, but reported cases of proximal gastric carcinomas, including tumors at the gastroesophageal junction, have increased. Early diagnosis of gastric cancer is difficult because most patients are asymptomatic in the early stage. Weight loss and abdominal pain often are late signs of tumor progression. Chronic atrophic gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, heavy alcohol use, and several dietary factors have been linked to increased risks for gastric cancer. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is the preferred diagnostic modality for evaluation of patients in whom stomach cancer is suspected. Accurate staging of gastric wall invasion and lymph node involvement is important for determining prognosis and appropriate treatment. Endoscopic ultrasonography, in combination with computed tomographic scanning and operative lymph node dissection, may be involved in staging the tumor. Treatment with surgery alone offers a high rate of failure. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not improved survival rates when used as single modalities, but combined therapy has shown some promise. Primary prevention, by control of modifiable risk factors and increased surveillance of persons at increased risk, is important in decreasing morbidity and mortality."
CD009944,0,15007245,0,New concepts of staging in gastrointestinal tumors as a basis of diagnosis and multimodal therapy.,"The therapy of gastrointestinal tumors is becoming more and more sophisticated and complex. This is due to an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of tumors, a more detailed classification and increasing therapeutic options. The basis of optimized therapeutic concepts is the exact evaluation of tumor spread and exact staging. The following review describes some of the most recent staging concepts in gastrointestinal tumors. Multislice computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and new supraparamagnetic iron oxide contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging enable an increasing quality of the visualization of tumors and metastases. 3D imaging will be used for planning of surgical interventions in the future. Optical coherence tomography may contribute to an improved tumor staging and, thus, to the safety of limited interventions in early oesophageal- and gastric cancer patients. Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound become increasingly important for the identification of small metastases in the peritoneum, in lymph nodes and in the liver. The sentinel lymph node concept will contribute to an improved staging and individualized therapy as well."

CD009944,0,14765308,0,Diagnosis of esophagogastric tumors.,"Esophagogastric tumors occur in three sectors: the esophagus, the EG junction and the non-cardia stomach. Neoplasia develops in the squamous stratified epithelium of the esophagus and in the columnar epithelium of the Barrett's esophagus or in the stomach. At the junction, tumors arise either in a very short Barrett's esophagus or in the gastric epithelium of the cardia. The prognosis of tumors detected at the advanced stage is poor. Secondary prevention requires detection at the early stage. Most superficial neoplastic lesions in the esophagus and in the stomach have a non-protruding appearance, which is similar for premalignant and malignant lesions. Improved accuracy in endoscopic diagnosis and prediction of histology prior to biopsy and treatment decision is based upon magnification with a optical zoom and electronic processing of the captured image with structure enhancement, enhancement of the color of hemoglobin and narrow band imaging. This applies particularly to the exploration of the Barrett's esophagus for identification of the areas with intestinal metaplasia and of flat neoplastic areas. In spite of the predictive value of endoscopy for histology, biopsy samples are still required for pathology and eventually studies with biological markers. Spectroscopic techniques provide a new perspective, up to the level of molecular endoscopy, but they are unlikely to be cost/effective. The classification in the sub-types 0 of neoplastic lesions has some relevance to prediction of depth of invasion. In the esophagus, EUS staging with high frequency miniprobes is a useful complement."

CD009944,0,14749619,0,Applications of endoscopic ultrasonography in pancreatic cancer.,"Accurate staging of pancreatic cancer is essential for surgical planning and for identification of locally advanced and metastatic disease that is incurable by surgery. Advances in endoscopic sonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography have improved the accuracy of staging and reduced the number of incomplete surgical resections. Tissue acquisition is necessary in nonsurgical cases when chemoradiotherapy is considered. The complex regional anatomy of the pancreas makes cytologic diagnosis of malignancy at this region difficult without exploratory surgery. Although CT-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is used for this purpose, reports of an increased risk of peritoneal dissemination of cancer cells and a false-negative rate of nearly 20% make this a poor choice. The ability to position the EUS-transducer in direct proximity to the pancreas by means of the stomach and duodenum, combined with the use of FNA, increases the specificity of EUS in detecting pancreatic malignancies."
CD009944,0,14745281,0,Pitfalls of endoscopic ultrasound staging after application of electrocautery.,"Patients may be referred for endosonography after endoscopic resection of polyps because of cancer identified in the histologic specimen. To assess the effects of electrocautery-induced tissue changes on tumor staging by endosonography, endosonography findings after endoscopic removal of large polyps were correlated with surgical and endoscopic pathology. Endosonography findings revealed irregular and thickened wall layers, especially in the muscularis propria with pseudopod extensions. Five of 7 patients had evidence of cancer in the endoscopic specimen. However, no residual tumor was found in the surgically resected bowel (2 patients) or in subsequent biopsies of the endoscopic resection site (3 patients). In 2 other patients, no cancer was present in the endoscopic specimen, and follow-up biopsies of the endoscopic resection site were all benign. Electrocautery-induced inflammatory changes create hypoechoic changes within the gut wall that may mimic tumor invasion. Irregularities in the muscularis propria layer cannot be relied upon to diagnose a T2 or T3 lesion by endosonography in this setting. Patients with large polyps greater than 2 cm and other mucosal lesions with malignant potential should undergo endosonography prior to endoscopic resection."

Its incidence in the West has been on the decline for more than 40 years; however, the location of gastric cancer has shifted proximally in the past 15 years. The reason for this shift is not clear. Diffuse histology is also more common now than intestinal type of histology. Advances have been made in staging procedures such as laparoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography and in possible functional imaging techniques. The current TNM classification requires an examination of at least 15 lymph nodes; therefore, at least a D1 dissection is recommended. Patients with locoregional gastric carcinoma should also be referred to high-volume treatment centers. Combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting for select group of patients is considered the new standard in the United States. The NCCN Gastric Cancer Guidelines portray uniformity in the systemic approach to cancer in the United States.

Except diarrhoea, less frequent in patients with ZES-MEN 1 than in sporadic ZES, and specific MEN 1-related signs, clinical characteristics are similar in both ZES types. Acid output and gastrin levels are also similar whether in the basal state or after secretin stimulation. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) exists in the majority of ZES-MEN 1 patients, 30% have pituitary adenoma (prolactinomas for half), 30% adrenal involvement, 25 to 30% have EC-Lomas; bronchial and thymic carcinoids have probably been underevaluated. Gastrinomas are multiple predominantly located in the duodenal wall, but also in the pancreas in association with clinically silent endocrine tumors. The spread of the disease: metastases to the liver (LM), mediastinum, bones, is evaluated at best by Octreoscan. Endoscopic ultrasonography evaluates the number, size and anatomical characteristics of gastrinomas. Patients without LM have an excellent prognosis. Surgery never cures ZES, but is necessary in case of associated life-threatening condition such as insulinoma and has been advocated to prevent LM development in patients with large pancreatic tumor(s). However although, indeed, the size of the tumor, when located in the pancreas > 3 cm, favours metachronous LM occurrence, surgery, in our experience, has not been able to prevent LM development. Hepatic malignancies remain however the most pejorative prognostic determinant for survival and raise the most difficult therapeutic challenge. Surgery is the best option whenever feasible; specific chemotherapy and chemo-embolisation have not conclusively achieved definite successes. Long-term octreotide treatment, however, has been shown recently to obtain tumour stabilisation. Internal irradiation with 90 Ytrium-labelled octreotide is a new promising option, presently under evaluation (Novartis European trial). Preliminary results are promising."
CD009944,0,14653414,0,Staging esophageal adenocarcinoma.,"The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased dramatically in Western societies over the last 20 years. Most patients present with advanced disease. Stage-dependent treatment protocols require the most complete and accurate staging possible. With all esophageal cancers (ie, adenocarcinomas and squamous carcinomas), it is perhaps most important to identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from aggressive treatment. The performance characteristics and clinical utility of CT scanning, endoscopic ultrasound, FDG-PET, and minimally invasive surgery in staging esophageal cancer are reviewed, including issues relating specifically to staging of adenocarcinomas. These investigations are not mutually exclusive and each has its own strengths and shortcomings. Accurate staging often requires the use of multiple modalities. The optimal staging algorithm for a given practice setting (if it exists) will be determined largely by local variables that include patient population, available technology, and local expertise in applying such technology. A lack of consensus on the effectiveness of therapeutic alternatives (particularly surgical v nonsurgical methods) may also affect the perceived value of the various staging modalities and how they are used."

This therapeutic procedure was used as an alternative method of drainage of the biliary tree because endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was not possible and because the percutaneous metallic stent which had been inserted earlier had become occluded (probably by tumor overgrowth). It was a two-step procedure. In the first step a hepatic duct was punctured through the gastric wall with placement of a plastic stent, which created a fistula between them. In a second step a covered, metallic, self-expandable stent was substituted for the plastic stent to maintain the anastomosis and to improve patency over the medium term.

Laparoscopic localization of endoluminal tumors included intraoperative endoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound, and laparoscopic palpation. There were five males with a mean age of 57 years. Laparoscopic approaches to resection were laparoscopic wedge resection (n = 4) for tumors in the gastric fundus and antrum, laparoscopic enucleation (n = 2) for tumors in the gastric cardia, and transgastric endoluminal resection (n = 1) for a tumor located at the gastroesophageal junction.

CD009944,0,12884143,0,[Minimally invasive options for gastric tumors].,"Depending on the origin of the tumor tissue, gastric tumors may be more or less accessible for biopsy diagnostics. However, especially submucous tumors present a diagnostic problem. Entity and dignity may remain unclear particularly in larger tumors and may not be clarified before operative excision via gastrotomy and frozen section diagnostics. Similar problems may occur in the diagnostics of epithelial tumors, if a reliable appraisal of the dignity based on forceps biopsy is impossible. To clarify their entity and dignity, tumors can be completely extirpated with minimally invasive techniques."

CD009944,0,12809817,0,Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.,"The connection between Helicobacter pylori and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is well established. H. pylori infection causes an immunological response, leading to chronic gastritis with formation of lymphoid follicles within the stomach. These lymphoid follicles resemble nodal tissues found throughout the body and are composed of reactive T cells and activated plasmal cells and B cells. The B cells are responsible for initiating a clonal expansion of centrocyte-like cells that form the basic histology of MALT lymphoma. Early diagnosis of MALT lymphoma is difficult but essential for adequate treatment. Clinical symptoms are vague and varied, with abdominal pain being a common presenting complaint. The endoscopic appearance of this tumor is varied and can be infiltrative, exophytic, or ulcerative. In addition, the tumor can have a multifocal distribution, and therefore aggressive tissue sampling is crucial for diagnosis. Endoscopic ultrasound is essential to document the extent of disease and is more accurate than CT scan in detection of spread to perigastric lymph nodes. Lesions that are confined to the mucosa or submucosa of the gastric wall are believed to be dependent on H. pylori stimulation and therefore can be successfully treated with H. pylori eradication. Those MALT lymphomas that present at more advanced stages require more aggressive management and can be treated with surgical resection, radiation, or chemotherapy. Follow-up is critical in all patients who have been treated with H. pylori eradication and consists of multiple endoscopic biopsies for histological and molecular studies as well as endoscopic ultrasound at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. The reappearance of MALT lymphomas has been seen years after treatment, and therefore follow-up of these patients should be indefinite."

CD009944,0,12783253,0,Staging of colonic neoplasms by colonoscopic miniprobe ultrasonography.,In contrast to the situation in the upper gastrointestinal tract staging of colonic neoplasm by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has not gained importance because until yet preoperative staging is without any clinical consequences. This may change with the introduction of minimally invasive surgical procedures and endoscopic resection techniques as an alternative to conventional (open) surgery.
CD009944,0,12772051,0,High interobserver variability in endosonographic staging of upper gastrointestinal cancers.,"Mostly based on results of experienced examiners, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been reported to be highly accurate for locoregional staging of upper gastrointestinal cancers. However, data on interobserver variability among EUS examiners, depending on their experience levels, is sparse. A study was therefore conducted to analyse well-documented videotapes of EUS examinations of 108 patients with resected cancers of the esophagus (n = 55) or stomach (n = 53) in a strictly blinded fashion by 5 examiners, all of whom were experienced in EUS (more than 300 examinations: n = 3, more than 100 examinations: n = 2). Besides the individual accuracy rates in cancer staging, a kappa-statistic was calculated to check for interobserver variability. Under the conditions described, the staging accuracy of all investigators was lower than that usually achieved under clinical routine conditions. The mean T staging accuracy was 41.1 % +/- 9.4 and 46.9 % +/- 5.4 in gastric and esophageal cancers, respectively. For N-staging the respective values were 47.9 % +/- 5.1 (stomach) and 67.7 % +/- 5.4 (oesophagus). Kappa-values were above 0.4 only in the staging of non-invasive esophagogastric tumours of the N0 and T1-category, corresponding to a fairly good agreement among the five investigators. Differences depending on experience levels could not be consistently found. Hence, it can be concluded that endosonographic cancer staging performed in a blinded manner results in a low accuracy and high interobserver variability even among experienced examiners."

We report a case of gastric glomus tumor diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Smears exhibited groups of cohesive, uniform, small, round to polygonal cells with scant cytoplasm, indistinct cell borders, and round, hyperchromatic nuclei with homogeneous chromatin. The cell block contained fragments of cells with similar morphologic features and immunohistochemical staining exhibited positivity for smooth muscle actin and vimentin. The diagnosis was confirmed by the surgically resected specimen. Ultrastructural examination revealed prominent pinocytotic vesicles lining the plasmalemma. In this report, we discuss the differential diagnosis of gastric glomus tumor and compare the cytologic features of this case with two others reported in the literature."

Secondary development of gastric cancer, however, is thought to be a rare event. The detection of a signet ring cell carcinoma during follow-up endoscopy after successful therapy of MALT lymphoma in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome prompted us to analyse the frequency of subsequent gastric cancer in patients with underlying autoimmune disease (AD)."
CD009944,0,12734683,0,Pathophysiological studies on the relationship between postgastrectomy syndrome and gastric emptying function at 5 years after pylorus-preserving distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer.,"Pylorus-preserving distal gastrectomy (PPG) has frequently been performed on patients with early gastric cancer in Japan to prevent the postgastrectomy syndrome seen after conventional distal gastrectomy (CDG). The long-term postoperative quality of life (QOL) and gastric emptying function in patients after PPG has not been assessed in detail. To clarify the usefulness of PPG for treating early gastric cancer we investigated the relation between postgastrectomy syndrome and gastric emptying function 5 years after PPG and then compared the results with those 5 years after CDG. Altogether, 32 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy at our clinic for early gastric cancer (submucosal cancer without lymph node metastasis) were studied. Ten subjects who underwent PPG with D2 lymphadenectomy without preserving the hepatic and pyloric branches of the vagal nerve [group A: eight men, two women; age 33-70 years (mean 60.7 years)] were interviewed and asked about appetite, weight loss, epigastric fullness, reflux esophagitis, and early dumping syndrome. They were compared with patients after CDG [group B: 36-72 years (mean 63.6 years)]. Esophagogastric endoscopy, abdominal ultrasonography, and gastric emptying function were also studied. The gastric emptying time of a semisolid diet was measured with a radioisotope method using (99m)Tc-labeled rice gruel; the gastric emptying time of a liquid diet was measured with the acetaminophen method using orange juice. The control subjects (group C) consisted of 18 healthy volunteers (10 men, 8 women) without gastrointestinal symptoms aged 38 to 68 years (mean 60.8 years). The following results were obtained: PPG (group A) alleviated postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms such as appetite loss, reflux esophagitis, early dumping syndrome, lost body weight, endoscopic reflux esophagitis, endoscopic gastritis in the remnant stomach, and postogastrectomy cholecystolithiasis better than did CDG (group B). The only weak point with the PPG procedure was that it produced a feeling of epigastric fullness. The pattern of the gastric emptying curve for the semisolid diet was almost the same among groups A, B, and C, although delayed gastric emptying was clearly more frequent in group A than in group B or C ( p < 0.05). Gastric emptying with the liquid diet in group B was significantly faster than that in groups A and C ( p < 0.01). Gastric emptying in groups A and C was similar. These results showed that PPG improved the postoperative QOL, but the delayed emptying of semisolid diet after PPG led to a feeling of epigastric fullness after meals due to retention of contents in the residual stomach. Epigastric fullness after meals continued in many patients after PPG. Thus the only disadvantage of the PPG procedure is the sensation of epigastric fullness and gastric stasis due to delayed gastric emptying of a semisolid diet."

CD009944,0,12544191,0,Endoscopic ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal disorders.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) plays a vital role in management of upper gastrointestinal disorders, particularly cancer of the esophagus, pancreas, stomach, lung (via transesophageal mediastinal staging), and bile duct. Endoscopic ultrasound has also been valuable in detection of early chronic pancreatitis (CP). In cancer of the esophagus, the primary role of EUS is to determine whether disease is localized (T1-2, N0) and appropriate for surgery, locally advanced (T3-4, N1, M1a) (which may benefit from chemoradiation with or without surgery), or metastatic. Pancreatic and bile duct cancers are more complex given the controversy over portal vein resection. In centers that resect tumors invading the portal venous system, the role of EUS is limited to tissue confirmation or identification of metastases to the liver or distant lymph nodes. In centers that do not resect the portal vein invasion, EUS plays an important role in local staging. In lung cancer, EUS is emerging as an accurate, nonsurgical alternative to staging the mediastinum through EUS fine-needle aspiration. Endoscopic ultrasound has an important role in diagnosing CP because of its high degree of sensitivity. This has also led to controversy over whether EUS can overdiagnose CP. For these reasons, we recommend the use of a high threshold for EUS and that CP be diagnosed in conjunction with other standard tests (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, pancreatic function tests)."

CD009944,0,12517554,0,Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy with systemic lymph node dissection for early gastric carcinoma: a review of 43 cases.,"Recently, laparoscopy and laparoscopy-assisted surgery have been used increasingly as less-invasive alternatives to conventional open surgery. But the use of this approach in gastric carcinoma has received little attention, possibly from the low incidence of early-stage disease in the West and the relative complexity of the surgical procedure."
CD009944,0,12510224,0,Diagnosis of esophagogastric tumors.,"It has been suggested that certain histological criteria may serve to indicate a good prognosis in patients with esophageal carcinoma. These include absence of subepithelial extension of the carcinoma cells, stage no higher than m2, and no neoplastic involvement near the resection margin. As endoscopic mucosal resection is becoming an accepted treatment option in this type of tumor, prognostic parameters of this type are of particular interest. By contrast, when metastases are detected in the celiac lymph nodes, it implies that the tumor is unresectable and that palliative treatment is required. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration has been found to be the most cost-effective option in this setting. Although autofluorescence endoscopy is being tested as a new technique for endoscopic diagnosis, its value is at present unclear. However, such developments may lead to improved diagnosis in the future, particularly in relation to the initial stages of carcinoma. For the moment, EUS is still the most widely accepted method for early diagnosis and staging. Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma appears to be commonly associated with head and neck cancer, but the cost-effectiveness of surveillance is a matter of controversy. With regard to Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma, p53 staining in areas of low-grade dysplasia appears to be helpful for predicting progression to high-grade dysplasia. The prevalence of short-segment Barrett's esophagus increases with age, but the length of the segment does not increase with time; the length probably depends on individual conditions, not merely on elapsed time. Helicobacter pylori infection appears to be associated with intestinal metaplasia at the esophagogastric junction. However, the most recent data appear to suggest that this scenario (usually termed ""carditis"") may be different from intestinal metaplasia in the lower esophagus, related to acid reflux. A follow-up program might be able to detect Barrett's esophagus adenocarcinoma at earlier stages, but only a minority of Barrett's esophagus patients are likely to be detected before neoplasia has developed. Gastric cancer appears to develop in individuals with H. pylori infection, but not in uninfected persons. In addition, those with severe gastric atrophy, corpus-predominant gastritis, and intestinal metaplasia may be at greater risk for gastric cancer. This again raises the question of H. pylori eradication in asymptomatic individuals with infection, and surveillance of patients with severe intestinal metaplasia. The most recent data appear to support the notion that healing of MALT lymphoma depends not only on H. pylori eradication and on the stage of the tumor, but also on individual factors (possibly immunology-related)."
CD009944,0,12690990,0,Early-stage gastric MALT lymphomas: eradication of H. pylori and outcome.,Lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue are special because of their indolent course.

CD009944,0,12622429,0,EUS may have limited impact on the endoscopic management of gastric carcinoids.,"Background. Carcinoids are occasionally found during gastroscopy. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) can determine the depth of invasion and vascularity of submucosal tumors, including carcinoid tumors. Thus, EUS can lead to an informed decision as to whether to attempt endoscopic or surgical excision of a carcinoid. The three cases described here were found by EUS to be amenable to endoscopic resection of submucosal carcinoid tumors. In each case, the margin of the specimen obtained led to uncertainty regarding the completeness of gastroscopic excision of the tumor. Guidelines for follow-up of gastric carcinoid are few. The incompleteness of endoscopic resection of submucosal tumors, with tumor found at the specimen margin, indicates that careful follow-up and/or consideration of other means of excision are indicated."

At follow-up endoscopy, 5 years later, tumour size had increased and its appearance had changed with respect to previous examinations. On endoscopic ultrasonography, the tumour was solid and confined mainly to the submucosal layer of the gastric wall. Examination of biopsy specimens failed to provide any useful information. After biopsy, tumour size and the area of reddish discoloration decreased and endoscopic ultrasonography revealed multiple small cystic lesions in the tumour. Endoscopic resection was then performed with complete excision of the tumour without complications or recurrence.

CD009944,0,12510455,0,Gastrointestinal endoscopic ultrasonography.,"Although conventional endoscopy provides excellent visualization of gastrointestinal mucosa, it provides little information about intramural or nearby extramural lesions. The imaging of intraabdominal structures by conventional transabdominal ultrasound is degraded by ultrasound energy attenuation with distance. The provision of an ultrasound probe on a flexible gastrointestinal endoscope, to form an echoendoscope, provides excellent imaging of the gastrointestinal wall and of adjacent extramural structures. During the last two decades, endoscopic ultrasound, using an echoendoscope, has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases that affect the submucosa, deep bowel wall, and adjacent extramural structures.

CD009944,0,12499740,0,Is there additional information from laparoscopic ultrasound in tumor staging?,"Accurate preoperative staging of gastrointestinal malignancies is of major importance in the decision for adequate stage-related therapy. There is evidence that laparoscopy in combination with laparoscopic ultrasound is more accurate in the detection of intra-abdominal metastases than conventional preoperative imaging. Staging laparoscopy in combination with laparoscopic ultrasound is a minimally invasive technique that reveals intra-abdominal disseminated tumor spread and local tumor extent. Therefore laparoscopic ultrasound is an ideal adjunct to laparoscopy because this technique may compensate for the lack of tactile feedback with laparoscopic instruments. Color-coded Doppler imaging can be very valuable for the assessment of resectability in patients with pancreatic cancer. Current data confirm that laparoscopic ultrasound is capable of enhancing the accuracy of staging laparoscopy. Compared to standard laparoscopy, a combination of both techniques markedly increases the sensitivity of staging laparoscopy in the determination of unresectable disease. This is of major importance in the assessment of occult liver metastases and lymph node involvement. Laparoscopic ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional imaging techniques and should be considered as integral part of staging laparoscopy."

Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) is currently the most sensitive modality for the detection of small hepatic lesions. However, IOUS is invasive requiring laparoscopy or formal laparotomy. We sought to evaluate the feasibility of using endoscopic ultrasonograhpy (EUS) for the detection and diagnosis of hepatic masses in patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCCA) and metastatic lesions (ML). We hypothesized that EUS could detect small (<1.0 cm) hepatic lesions undetectable by CT scan and could be used for biopsy of deep-seated hepatic lesions."
CD009944,0,12481735,0,Endoscopic ultrasound.,"Indications and the clinical utility of endosonography have evolved as new technology, such as linear array echoendoscopes and EUS-guided fine needle aspiration, has emerged. The most noteworthy of the EUS applications are for cancer staging; including rectal, pancreatic, lung, and esophageal malignancies. There is little doubt that EUS is a powerful tool for cancer imaging, but its clinical impact in patient care and management has yet to be validated in prospective outcome studies. Other imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET), dual-phased helical CT, and MR imaging technology will undoubtedly provide increasingly accurate diagnostic and staging information for gastrointestinal diseases. EUS imaging alone may assume a less significant role in relation to these noninvasive modalities in the future. EUS-guided FNA, as well as therapeutic EUS applications, will likely continue to expand in scope and play an important role in clinical medicine for many years to come."

CD009944,0,12460468,0,Multiparametric in situ mRNA hybridization analysis of gastric biopsies predicts lymph node metastasis in patients with gastric carcinoma.,"We examined the expression level of several genes that regulate different steps in metastasis formation in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsies of 189 primary human gastric carcinomas prior to surgical resection in patients in whom lymph node metastasis was not evident by endoscopic ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan. The expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and E-cadherin were examined by a colorimetric in situ mRNA hybridization technique. The integrity of the mRNAs was verified, leaving 161 (85.2%) patients for study. After gastrectomy, 82 patients had positive lymph nodes and 79 patients had negative lymph nodes. The concurrent expression levels of MMP-2 and E-cadherin mRNAs were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the metastatic tumors than the non-metastatic tumors. Expression of EGF-R and VEGF was not different between the metastatic and non-metastatic tumors. However, when only the intestinal-type of gastric cancer was evaluated, the level of VEGF mRNA was significantly higher in tumors associated with lymph node metastasis than in those without metastasis. However, a high MMP-2:E-cadherin ratio significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis in both types of gastric cancer. These results suggest that multiparametric in situ hybridization analysis for several metastasis-related genes may allow the preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis from gastric cancer."

CD009944,0,12063829,0,"Interventional endoscopy, neoadjuvant therapy and the gastroenterologist.","With current treatment, survival of greater than 1 year should be anticipated for many patients with pancreatic cancer. Cure rates (5-year survival) of greater than 10% have been achieved even for unresectable disease. Obstructive jaundice is managed successfully with endoscopic placement of a plastic stent early in the evaluation of a patient with suspected regional pancreatic cancer, and a metal wall stent is reserved for patients with known 1997 AJCC stage IVB carcinoma or nonoperative patients. Relief of biliary obstruction allows improvement in liver function and more time to evaluate tumor stage accurately to determine initial treatment (see Fig. 1). A cost-effective algorithm to determine accurate stage and treatment can start with the size of the mass on initial imaging studies. EUS-guided FNA represents a significant improvement over CT scan-guided FNA to make a tissue diagnosis. Small pancreatic masses that would be resected regardless of whether an FNA is positive or negative require only an EUS evaluation to establish an early resectable stage. Tumors reliably staged as unresectable by nonoperative imaging methods including EUS are treated with chemotherapy with or without concurrent radiotherapy because median survival of these patients is 2 years in some series. Tumors can be resected after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. For chronic pain or gastric outlet obstruction not responding or treatable by chemoradiotherapy, endoscopically guided celiac plexus nerve block and stenting improve the quality of life for patients with pancreatic cancer. A team approach is required to achieve the objectives of improved quality of life, prolonged survival, and possible cure for pancreatic cancer. The optimal combination and sequencing of staging methods, including EUS, specialized CT scan, MR imaging, intraoperative findings, and pathologic evaluations, would improve selection of patients for potential curative resection. Interpretations of disease stage based on each of these methods may overlap but are not identical and are operator dependent.

The recurrence rates have decreased with the new operation techniques and preoperative radiotherapy, thus increasing the importance of accurate tumor staging. Double contrast barium enema studies enable the diagnosis while staging and follow-up is best done by topographic imaging techniques."

CD009944,0,11992807,0,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CPT-11 and cisplatin downstages locally advanced gastric cancer.,"We examined the role of neoadjuvant therapy in downstaging locally advanced gastric cancer. Preoperative staging was performed with a combination of CT scans, endoscopic ultrasonography and/or laparoscopy, and laparoscopic ultrasonography. Patients with T > or =3 tumors and/or node-positive disease by preoperative clinical staging were eligible for entry. Neoadjuvant therapy consisted of two cycles of CPT-11 (75 mg/m(2)) with cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)) weekly four times every 6 weeks. This was followed by resection with D2 lymph node dissection and two cycles of intraperitoneal chemotherapy with floxuridine and cisplatin. Twenty-two patients were entered into the study (4 with T3N0 disease and 18 with T3N1 disease). Induction chemotherapy was well tolerated with major toxicities being neutropenia and diarrhea. A median of 78%/75% of the planned dosage of CPT-11/cisplatin was delivered. Two patients withdrew consent during the first cycle and were lost to follow-up. One patient progressed to stage IV disease during induction chemotherapy and did not undergo surgery. Nineteen patients underwent surgery. One patient had undetected stage IV disease (liver) and underwent a palliative R2 resection. Of the 18 remaining patients, 17 had curative R0 resections and one had a palliative R1 resection. A median of 21 lymph nodes (range 1 to 121) were examined histologically. There was one postoperative death. Surgical morbidity did not appear to increase after the neoadjuvant regimen. The median postoperative length of hospital stay was 9 days (range 3 to 75 days). Postoperative pathologic staging yielded 16% T3 lesions compared to 85% before treatment based on clinical staging; postoperative American Joint Committee on Cancer staging yielded 37% stage IIIA disease compared to 70% stage IIIA before treatment. With a median follow-up of 15 months, median survival has not yet been reached. We conclude that CPT-11-based neoadjuvant therapy downstages locally advanced gastric cancer. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the ultimate impact of this combination therapy on recurrence and survival."
CD009944,0,11989843,0,Diagnosis of a gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biopsies in a patient with a parotid gland localization.,"We report the case of a 32-year-old man with a low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the parotid gland associated with Sjögren syndrome. He underwent an upper endoscopy as part of the screening of a gastric localization which showed a diffuse non-specific gastritis. However, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) evidenced a focal wall thickening of the vertical portion of the smaller curvature. EUS-guided biopsies of this area disclosed a MALT lymphoma, whereas biopsies under endoscopy concluded to mild chronic gastritis. The search for Helicobacter pylori infection remained negative. Four months after treatment with anti-CD20 antibodies, EUS showed a diminution of the abnormal thickening of the second layer. Regression was confirmed histologically on new EUS-guided biopsies. MALT lymphoma is usually considered a localized disease; however, dissemination is probably more frequent than initially believed. Our case reflects the importance of a systematic screening for a gastric localization in patients with MALT lymphoma of the salivary glands. In this situation, association to autoimmune disease such as Sjögren syndrome is more likely to explain the gastric location than infection with H. pylori. Endoscopic ultrasonography has a major impact for the staging of gastric MALT lymphoma, but may also help diagnose focal infiltration by the disease."

CD009944,0,11831609,0,Endoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer.,"Patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of a pancreatic neoplasm typically undergo initial imaging with transabdominal ultrasound or computed tomography. This evaluation often reveals the presence of a pancreatic mass or fullness. At times, the nature of the lesion is poorly characterized, with uncertainty remaining as to whether the lesion is an inflammatory mass or a neoplasm, and if it is cystic or solid. In these circumstances, endoscopic procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and/or endoscopic ultrasound may be required. These procedures offer other means of tissue sampling, disease staging, and an option for palliative therapy.

CD009944,0,11778127,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography.,"Over the past two decades, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has undergone a transition from being a novel imaging technique to a clinical diagnostic test that is necessary for the optimal management of gastrointestinal diseases. EUS has established itself as an important diagnostic modality, mainly for the detection and staging of gastrointestinal cancers. As EUS has become more widespread, research has gradually shifted towards studies that explore the effect of EUS on patient management and outcome. These outcome studies have examined the primary clinical applications of EUS, such as esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer staging, as well as the role of EUS in the diagnosis of inflammatory pancreatic diseases. Widespread use of EUS has recently led to studies that examine complications associated with the performance of the procedure. Endosonographers have continued efforts to define a clinical role for EUS in other gastrointestinal diseases, such as portal hypertension. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is continuing to develop into a powerful diagnostic tool for the management of lung cancer and other mediastinal diseases. New applications for EUS-FNA are also emerging. Finally, investigators are continuing to explore the remaining frontier of EUS-guided therapy."
CD009944,0,11869324,0,Prognostic value of laparoscopic ultrasound in patients with gastro-esophageal cancer.,"Forty-four patients with gastro-esophageal tumors regarded as resectable by conventional staging underwent laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS). Following LUS, seven were found to be irresectable and were managed by palliative therapies. Thirty-seven patients proceeded to surgical exploration and 36 were resected (R0 80%, R1 11%, and R2 9%). All patients were reviewed until death or for a minimum of 24 months. Patients undergoing resection had a 62% 1-year survival (median 17 months; confidence intervals, CI 6-28). LUS defined nodal status indicated a trend toward prolonged survival in the node-negative group, median 22 months (CI 5-39), compared with 13 months (CI 6-20) in the node-positive group. Disease-free survival was greater in LUS node-negative patients at 29 months (CI 23-35) compared with node-positive patients at 13 months (CI 5-21) P=0.0083. LUS staging allows prediction of the likelihood of recurrence of gastro-esophageal malignancies. This may prove useful for the appropriate allocation of patients to primary and adjuvant therapies."
CD009944,0,11817475,0,Imaging features of pancreatic neoplasms.,"Pancreatic masses are common in daily imaging practice. The advent of helical CT and breathold MRI has provided a new impetus to the study of the pancreas not only for the potential of characterizing pancreatic masses and pancreatitis but also because of the more accurate staging of pancreatic neoplasms using this technique. Pancreatic tumors are classified according to its histologic origin. Ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common. Regarding ductal adenocarcinoma, despite the fast evolving imaging techniques promising an earlier diagnosis and an accurate staging, still the prognosis is extremely poor. However, new surgical data indicate that long-term survival although rare, occurs on resected tumors less than 2 cm, without vascular encasement or adenopathy. Logically, early detection and accurate staging of tumors has become the main focussing in pancreatic imaging since it may result in an increase in the survival of these patients. In this context, the role of imaging to identify, characterize and stage pancreatic neoplasms will be described. Furthermore, the key radiological features of a gamut of more uncommon pancreatic neoplasms will be illustrated. These include other exocrine epithelial tumors (anaplastic carcinoma, pancreatoblastoma, acinar cell carcinoma serous cystic pancreatic adenoma, mucinous cystic tumors, intraductal mucinous papillary tumor, and solid pseudopapillary neoplasm), endocrine tumors or islet cell tumors (insulinoma, gastrinoma, gluconoma, vipoma, non-functioning tumors), rare non-epithelial tumors (lymphoma, teratoma) and metastases to the pancreas."
CD009944,0,11816140,0,[Esophageal implantation metastasis from adenocarcinoma of the cardia].,"A 74 years old male patient was admitted to our department suffering from dysphagia for five months. Gastric Barium studies showed a cardia tumour with polypoid lesions in the wall of the esophagus, and gastro-esophageal reflux disease was also diagnosed. Endoscopy verified a cardia tumour with esophageal metastasis, and biopsy was obtained from the two lesions. Histology showed that both tumours were adenocarcinomas. Endoscopic ultrasonography classified the cardia tumour as grade T2. As observed during endoscopy, the wall of the esophagus at the level of the polypoid lesion was hypo-echogenic and thick which was result of thickened mucosa. Total gastrectomy and oesophagectomy was performed. Pathology showed that the cardia tumour was pT2N2 and type Siewert-Stein II. The esophageal polypoid lesion was also proved an adenocarcinoma, which was localized only to the mucosa. No tumour cells were found in the blood- or in lymph vessels between the tumour and the esophageal adenocarcinoma. We think that the polypoid adenocarcinoma in the esophagus is an esophageal metastasis implantation from the cardia adenocarcinoma. It is based on the exclusion of other possible tumour dissemination routes. Probably the gastro-esophageal reflux is responsible for the implantation of tumour cells."

CD009944,0,11753234,0,[Morphological imaging of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours].,"Biologically active neuroendocrine tumours produce early symptoms and are often difficult to diagnose owing to their small dimensions (<1 cm), whereas biologically inactive forms are often coarse and sometimes found by chance. As well as identifying the lesion, locoregional staging is also particularly important for therapeutic planning. Morphological imaging plays an important role in the identification of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, providing an anatomic substrate for receptorial imaging which usually precede it in the diagnostic work-up, whereas it plays a primary role in the locoregional staging of these neoplasms for which surgery is the first and essential therapeutic approach. In the case of endocrine tumours of the pancreas alone, the most accurate method of diagnosis is currently echo-endoscopy using high-frequency probes. Two-phase spiral CT and dynamic MR have proved equally effective means of identifying endocrine tumours of the pancreas with slightly higher sensitivity for MR, both playing a role in the locoregional staging of biologically active and inactive tumours. Traditional radiology also plays a role in the identification of intestinal carcinoids."
CD009944,0,11750230,0,Cancer of the esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction: potentially curative therapies.,"The definition of potential curative tumors of the esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction remains problematic. This is due to a lack of accuracy in clinical staging despite recent advances in CT, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), positron emission tomography scan and minimally invasive staging modalities. As a result much controversy persists regarding indications for surgery and extent of resection and lymphadenectomy. Today surgery with curative option results in five-year survival of over 30%. Multimodality regimens, especially neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, seem to be beneficial in patients with a complete response on pathologic staging. Other indications are investigational and should be studied within carefully monitored study protocols. In early carcinoma T(is)-T(1a) endoluminal ablation technique seem to open promising perspectives provided of discrimination between T(is)-T(1a) and T(1b) can be made by the use of 20mhz EUS probes."

This study evaluated the efficacy and accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) -guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy in the diagnosis of GIST and reported its cytomorphologic features. Twelve patients with gastric GIST were diagnosed through EUS-guided FNA. Immediate on-site evaluation and cytologic diagnoses were given in nine cases (75.0%) with an average of three passes. Cell blocks provided diagnostic material in three cases (25.0%). Spindle cells were present in the cytologic material in all cases. Two patients had subsequent surgical resections. Immunohistochemical (IHC) studies performed in cell blocks and two surgical specimens all supported the original diagnoses. In the two cases with surgical resections, IHC results in cell blocks were similar to that in the resected specimens. This study demonstrated that when combining smears and cell blocks, EUS-guided FNA is accurate and efficient in the diagnosis of GIST.

CD009944,0,11641096,0,Optimizing treatment of carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction.,"Overall prognosis in patients with carcinoma of the esophagus and Gastroesophageal junction remains poor mainly because of the late presentation and advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Over the last decades, clinical staging has improved, especially since the introduction of CT scan and echo-endoscopy; however, the clinical definition of potential curative tumors still remains unsatisfactory. More recently, the introduction of PET scanning seems to offer better perspective for more precise staging and evaluation of response. In centers with large experience, cure rates today are exceeding 30% after primary surgery. To improve the cure rate, much attention is paid to neoadjuvant multimodality regimens. In resectable tumors, induction therapy offers little or no benefit. In locally advanced tumors especially, the combination of induction chemoradiotherapy results in a complete response in a substantial number of patients. This subset of patients seems to benefit in terms of survival and cure, whereas the others do not. Future research, therefore, needs to focus on early identification of responders (e.g., through molecular biology) and new chemotherapeutic drugs with higher impact on tumor response and fewer side effects."

Malignant variety represents about 2.0% of malignant gastroenteric tumours. The Authors report a clinical case of malignant gastric and duodenojejunal GIST, in which the only surgical treatment seems to be definitive. R. S., a 69-year-old female, was admitted for asthenia and fever in January 1997. Endoscopic exploration, ultrasonography and CT-scan of the abdomen demonstrated an exophytic tumour in the greater gastric curvature and one tumour of 5.5 cm of diameter in the Treitz's angle. We performed a resection of the gastric tumour and the duodenojejunal angle. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after 14 postoperative hospital days. Histological analysis showed two spindle cells stromal tumours with mitotic rate > 20/10 HPF. The immunohistochemistry demonstrated the uncommitted origin of tumour cells. The patient refused the chemotherapy treatment. There was no local recurrence or metastasis at a follow up of 47 months, in spite the high malignancy degree. For this reason and because of the uncertain behaviour of benign GIST, the authors propose a lifelong follow up of the patients managed with potentially curative surgical resection."

CD009944,0,11464493,0,Staging laparoscopy for gastric cancer.,"The growing role of multimodal treatment plans for advanced gastric cancer has contributed to the development of more accurate preoperative staging strategies. The high diagnostic efficacy of video-laparoscopy as regards the M factor has been reported by many; preoperative laparoscopy therefore permits to avoid unhelpful surgical exploration in case of peritoneal dissemination of tumor or liver metastases undetected by conventional staging. At Memorial Sloan Kattering Cancer Center preoperative staging laparoscopy is currently included in the diagnostic algorithm for gastric cancer. Data from a consecutive series of 103 patients demonstrated metastatic disease in 24 patients (37%) who were considered to have localized cancer by computed tomography (CT) or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), with an accuracy of 94% with respect to the M factor. These patients did not require open surgery. Laparoscopic washings were obtained from 127 patients with gastric cancer and a positive correlation between the extent of disease and prevalence of positive cytology was noted (T1/T2: 0%, T3/T4: 10%, M+: 59%). Our experience suggests that laparoscopy has added value in staging patients with gastric carcinoma. It appears to be a safe and effective staging modality, avoiding unnecessary explorations and providing new means of directing appropriate treatment strategy."
CD009944,0,11459275,0,The Mayo clinic approach to the surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.,"Ductal carcinoma of the pancreas remains a challenging problem for gastrointestinal surgeons. Significant progress has been made in diagnosis, preoperative staging, and safety of surgery; however, long-term survival after resection is unusual, and cure is rare. That said, the authors maintain their aggressive posture regarding this disease, recognizing that resection offers the only potential for cure. The authors' approach such patients in the most efficient and least invasive manner possible, relying primarily on triple phase helical abdominal CT for clinical diagnosis and staging, reserving ERCP and EUS for diagnostic dilemmas. In fit candidates with potentially resectable lesions, the authors eschew pre- or intraoperative biopsy, angiography, or endoscopic stenting and use preliminary limited staging laparoscopy selectively. Surgical palliation is chosen for fit patients who, at exploration for potentially curative resection, are found to have occult distant metastases or locally unresectable disease. Radical pancreatoduodenectomy can be performed with a mortality rate of 3% or less, and although morbidity remains significant, most can be managed with conservative measures. Quality of life after pancreatoduodenectomy is good and, if not, is generally a manifestation of recurrence rather than physiologic alterations inherent to the procedure. Adjuvant chemoradiation is standard therapy after resection, recommended for those with locally unresectable disease but used selectively for those with distant metastasis. Survival after potentially curative resection has remained disappointing. Whether extended lymphadenectomy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation improves survival has not been determined. Clearly, methods for earlier diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and more effective adjuvant therapies are sorely needed."
CD009944,0,11451144,0,Endoscopic ultrasound in the evaluation and treatment of chronic pancreatitis.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was developed in the 1970s specifically for the purpose of improved imaging of the pancreas. The close proximity of the pancreas to the gastric and duodenal lumen allows EUS to obtain high-resolution images, unobstructed by overlying bowel gas. EUS has fewer complications than endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and can detect features of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in the pancreatic parenchyma and duct that are not visible to any other imaging modality. Because of this high sensitivity, questions have arisen whether EUS is oversensitive, especially to ''early"" CP. Without a definitive gold standard against which to measure EUS (or ERCP and function testing), it is currently not possible to know the true accuracy of these modalities for early CP. There is now an extensive body of literature suggesting that these early changes detected by EUS correlate with histologic changes of CP, and may predict response to pancreatic therapy. EUS is uniquely suited to performing endoscopic cyst drainage for pancreatic pseudocysts and for controlling the pain of CP by EUS-directed celiac plexus block. For endoscopic cystenterostomy, EUS allows the endoscopist to localize the cyst, determine if the cyst is drainable, and guide a needle and stent into the cyst in a single step. Several major questions remain. Can EUS features of CP guide other forms of therapy for CP such as enzyme replacement, sphincter of Oddi therapy, and stent therapy? Can the detection of early CP by EUS, and subsequent therapy, delay or prevent the onset of more severe CP? Can EUS detect early forms for dysplasia and malignancy in patients who are at high risk for pancreatic carcinoma? Do changes of ""early"" CP detected by EUS progress to more classic changes (calicification) over time?"

CD009944,0,11432306,0,Gastrointestinal tract cancer in the elderly.,"Gastrointestinal cancers are common in the elderly. In the 1990s, modest advances in the early diagnosis, staging, and treatment of gastrointestinal cancers were made. Emphasis has been placed on screening for colorectal cancer; development of new diagnostic and staging modalities, particularly endoscopic ultrasound; and introduction of new treatment regimens, such as chemoradiation programs for esophageal, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers as well as endoscopic mucosal resection of early gastrointestinal cancers. New palliative techniques, such as laser and photodynamic therapy and placement of enteral stents, are being used increasingly in patients who have advanced cancer and are not surgical candidates. In the past, attitudes toward the elderly affected the management of cancer. Age should not be the only parameter considered when addressing the treatment of a gastrointestinal malignancy. Management decisions in the elderly should follow the same principles as those in younger patients. A thorough medical evaluation in the elderly is necessary to evaluate the patient's risk and to optimize surgical, chemotherapeutic, and palliative outcomes."

The overall EUS accuracy for colorectal cancer T-staging is 78%, specificity is 73%, and sensitivity is 94%. In determining the nodal involvement by tumor, EUS has an accuracy of 75%, specificity of 73%, and sensitivity of 74%. Comparison with computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and MRI with endorectal coil (MRIEC) shows that EUS is an effective single modality for assessing tumor penetration of the rectal wall. It does not, however, allow the assessment of distant metastatic disease. For assessing lymph node involvement, MRIEC offers the most comprehensive information."

At the current presentation, she had been experiencing progressive epigastric discomfort for 3 months. The initial diagnosis was early gastric carcinoma, diffuse type, based on gastric biopsy findings and ultrasonographic endoscopy. A definitive diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer was confirmed after subtotal gastrectomy of a presumed primary early gastric carcinoma.

The introduction of miniature lenses may have contributed to this process, and an increasing number of physicians are using minilaparoscopy due to its safety and easy handling. Surgical studies have mainly focused on the evaluation of laparoscopic ultrasound for the detection of liver and lymph-node metastases. In specialized centers, laparoscopic ultrasound is also used for the estimation of locoregional pancreatic tumor spread, but the diagnostic impact of the method, particularly in colorectal carcinoma, still remains to be determined. Remarkably, the number of publications from gastroenterology departments has tended to increase in comparison with last year's review."
CD009944,0,11204980,0,Diagnosis of esophagogastric tumors.,"The incidence of esophageal tumors, and of adenocarcinoma in particular, has risen markedly in recent years in the developed countries. The use of a variety of histopathological and biological markers is now offering promising prospects for the future. Vertical tumor invasion, intratumoral microvessel density, antimucin monoclonal antibodies, flow cytometry, telomerase activity, and overexpression of cyclin D1 have been correlated with the staging and prognosis of esophageal carcinomas. By combining these markers with Lugol staining, a practical new method of staging esophageal tumors may become available in the coming years. As is well known, Barrett's mucosa is a preneoplastic condition. Discussions in the literature concerning short forms of Barrett's esophagus and their relationship to inflammation of the gastric cardia appear to describe two different scenarios--a gastroesophageal reflux condition for short forms of Barrett's esophagus, and an inflammatory phenomenon (perhaps unrelated to Helicobacter pylori infection) for inflammation of the gastric cardia. Cost-benefit studies of follow-up procedures in Barrett's esophagus have yet to be conducted, and considerable efforts--mainly using biological markers--are being made to identify those patients who are at greatest risk. Although the frequency of gastric tumors has declined in recent years, many as yet unclear aspects of these tumors have been studied. Technological progress has not led to substantial changes in the diagnostic procedures used, although autofluorescence methods and three-dimensional reconstruction have been analyzed. Laparoscopy, preferably combined with the use of ultrasound probes, may be a valuable tool for staging. The suggestion that endoscopy should be avoided in young patients (the ""treat but do not scope"" approach) has been seriously questioned, as it may lead to early cancer being overlooked. There is thought to be an intermediate stage of gastric cancer (between the early and advanced stages) in which the muscularis propria, but not the serosa, is invaded. Endoscopic ultrasonography is becoming increasingly established as a basic tool for the staging of gastric cancer. Gastric MALT lymphoma can be cured by H. pylori eradication therapy in many cases, but there is still uncertainty regarding the limitations of this approach."

In addition, secondary achalasia should be suspected in patients who do not respond to therapy with botulinum toxin within 2 months. Because none of the mentioned tests can distinguish between primary achalasia and secondary forms due to carcinoma of the cardia, biopsy specimens should be obtained. It appears that, although there is a minimal risk for complications, a diagnostic procedure such as biopsy would be appropriate when the information obtained could be essential. In some cases EUS can be an additional diagnostic tool, because lesions of the submucosa and the surrounding area can be identified by EUS."

In this study, we evaluate our treatment strategy by reviewing the patients prospectively undergoing modified D1 lymphadenectomy. The clinicopathological characteristics and survival data of 138 patients who underwent modified D1 lymphadenectomy between 1987--when we first introduced endoscopic ultrasonography--and 1996 were analyzed. The criteria for modified D1 lymphadenectomy were mucosal, node negative gastric cancer by pre-operative and intra-operative examinations. Depth of invasion was correctly diagnosed in 80% of the patients. Among the resultant submucosal gastric cancer patients, the incidence of slight submucosal invasion was increased in the second half-period (78%) as compared with that in the first half-period (44%). Nodal involvement was observed in 4 patients (2.9%); all of them exhibited the depressed type with ulceration and a histologically high grade of gastric cancer. Because their metastasized lymph nodes were all confined to the perigastric region, surgical treatment resulted in no residual cancer macroscopically. No patients succumbed to gastric cancer within the median and mean follow-up periods of over 6 years. These results suggest that our modified D1 lymphadenectomy is an effective option for the pre-operatively and intra-operatively diagnosed mucosal, node negative gastric cancer which meets our criteria."

It is concluded that endoscopic ultrasound is more reliable for preoperative staging than conventional ultrasound, computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging for gastric cancer.

CD009944,0,11077579,0,[Combined laparoscopic-endoscopic procedure in stomach carcinoma].,"The purpose of this review is to outline the laparoscopic-endoscopic procedures that we perform for early gastric cancer. These procedures were applied to 29 patients. Preoperative work-up included gastric endoscopy, barium X-ray examination, endoscopic ultrasonography, and histological examination, and surgery was performed in patients diagnosed as having mucosal gastric cancer for which endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was difficult. Laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach using the lesion-lifting method, by which a wedge resection is made while pulling up the full-thickness gastric wall, was carried out in the 16 patients with lesions of the anterior wall, lesser curvature, and greater curvature of the stomach. On pathological examination of resected specimens, the surgical margin and lymphatic or venous invasion were negative in all these patients. The histological depth of the lesions was m (mucosal cancer) in 15 patients and sm1 (slight cancer infiltration into the submucosal layer) in one. This one patient later underwent gastrectomy but no lymph node metastases were found. Oral nutrition was resumed for a mean (+/- SD) of 2.9 +/- 0.8 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.3 +/- 3.4 days. The 13 patients with lesions of the posterior wall of the stomach and near the cardia or the pylorus received laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection. Laparotomy was required in 1 of these patients due to intraoperative hemorrhage. The surgical margins were negative in all 12 patients in whom laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection was successful. Lymphatic or venous invasion was positive in 2, both of whom had sm1 cancer lesions of both of these patients were located in the cardiac region, total gastrectomy was avoided, and careful observation is continued. Oral nutrition was resumed 4.0 +/- 1.6 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.0 +/- 3.5 days. In addition, no postoperative complication was noted after either procedure, and all patients have been recurrence free for a follow-up period of 460 months. Selected properly, these laparoscopic endoscopic procedures are considered to be curative and minimally invasive treatments for early gastric cancer."

CD009944,0,11030075,0,Malignant tumors of the stomach. Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and Helicobacter pylori.,"With the help of many clinical studies, the diagnosis and therapy of gastric MALT lymphoma have evolved. Major progress has been seen in this area, including improvement of biopsy diagnosis, better histologic classification, new information concerning pathogenesis, and, especially, the start of a revolution in the treatment of low-grade gastric MALT lymphomas by eradicating H. pylori. About 12 clinical studies with almost 400 patients and case reports have shown that cure of H. pylori infection is associated with complete remission in approximately 80% of patients with low-grade MALT lymphoma in an early clinical stage. To establish H. pylori eradication as the primary choice in low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma further, it is necessary to select patients before therapy who are most likely to benefit from this single treatment modality. An excellent histologic workup of obtained biopsy specimens and comprehensive clinical staging are necessary. Because of the supposition that H. pylori-related growth support may play a role only in the early stages of low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma, the importance of determining the depth of lymphoma infiltration in the gastric wall is evident. Examinations by endosonographic ultrasonography have been shown to be the most reliable method to differentiate the layers of the gastric wall and to determine the infiltration depth of lymphomas. Eradication of H. pylori has to be considered as a first-line and single treatment modality in patients with low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma in clinical stage EI1. As a therapy with fewer side effects than radiation, surgery, or chemotherapy and as a stomach-conserving treatment, eradication of H. pylori in patients with low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma should be the treatment of the choice within clinical trials because there are no long-term results available thus far. Besides pretreatment patient selection, careful follow-up with endoscopy, biopsies, and clinical staging including endoscopic ultrasonography is necessary. A 5- to 10-year follow-up is necessary before the definitive value of H. pylori eradication can be established, but long-term results are excellent thus far. There are many questions to be addressed: What are the exact mechanisms that lead to the malignant transformation of a reactive infiltrate? Why do approximately 20% of low-grade MALT lymphomas not regress after H. pylori eradication? Is there a molecular-genetic or immunologic point of no return? What is the biologic significance of the immunoglobulin rearrangement detected with PCR? What will be the 5- and 10-year relapse-free survival rates of patients suffering from low-grade MALT lymphoma treated with H. pylori eradication alone as first and only treatment? The wave of new data each year about the role of H. pylori in gastric MALT lymphoma may help many of these questions to be answered."

Gastrinomas and insulinomas are the two most common pancreatic endocrine tumors. Unlike pancreatic adenocarcinoma, in which tumor stage, resectability, and prognosis are determined by the tumor, nodes, and metastasis (TNM) classification, the prognosis of pancreatic endocrine tumors is determined by the presence of liver but not regional lymph node metastasis. This review focuses predominantly on the different diagnostic tools available to the clinician and the relative merits of each modality.

CD009944,0,10967752,0,Surgical staging of esophageal cancer.,"The rising incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the poor overall 5-year survival using current treatment regimens make it essential that clinical trials continue to search for more effective regimens for specific stages of esophageal cancer. It is clear from work in non-small cell lung cancer that clinical efficacy for platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens has shown promise only in specific subsets of patients, such as those with stage IIIa tumors, but no benefit at all for earlier stages. In lung cancer, mediastinoscopy has been shown to be the most accurate method to stage locoregional lymph nodes and is considered to be the gold standard for clinical trials. In esophageal cancer, accurate surgical staging of all locoregional lymph nodes is more complex and may involve abdominal, thoracic, and cervical areas. Molecular evidence of lymph node involvement in esophageal cancer suggests that even histologically negative nodes may harbor micrometastases in a significant number of cases. Laparoscopy and thoracoscopy now offer a more accurate alternative to conventional staging of esophageal cancer. For distal esophageal cancers near the gastroesophageal junction, laparoscopic staging alone may suffice in most cases. Associated costs and the requirement for a surgical procedure should encourage the continued evaluation of new noninvasive modalities and the further evolution of endoscopic ultrasound. Currently, we recommend the application of minimally invasive surgical staging to assess new noninvasive technologies, such as PET scanning, and for use in clinical trials until the definitive approach to staging esophageal cancer is established. We are currently participating in an ongoing multicenter study of thoracoscopic and laparoscopic staging for esophageal cancer."

A control ultrasonographic examinations demonstrated the normal five layers structure of the gastric wall without any alteration. In our patient Helicobacter pylori eradication was an effective therapy for gastric MALT lymphoma as well. Our results similar as are published in the literature.

The subjects enrolled in this study were 75 patients, with 78 gastric cancers (diagnosed as mucosal cancer without ulcerous changes on endoscopy and as histologically differentiated adenocarcinoma on biopsy), who were also examined by EUS. We retrospectively classified EUS features of the third layer (submucosa) into five groups: (1) irregular narrowing, (2) budding sign, (3) multiple echo-free spots, (4) unclear, and (5) no changes. In endoscopically diagnosed gastric mucosal cancer, 16 of the 78 lesions were associated with histologic submucosal invasion. EUS features that were associated with a high incidence of histological submucosal tumor invasion were irregular narrowing (submucosal invasion, 60.0%) and the budding sign (85.7%), and 90.9% of lesions with either of these features had submucosal invasion of tumors when tumorous changes in the third layer exceeded 1 mm in depth. Endosonographic irregular narrowing and a budding sign of more than 1 mm in depth in the third layer are useful for the diagnosis of submucosal invasion in gastric cancers that are diagnosed as mucosal cancers without ulcerous change on endoscopy."

Long-term post-treatment follow-up of a multicenter trial in the north-east of Italy and evaluation of the diagnostic protocol's adequacy.,"The effect of eradication of Helicobacter pylori on early stage gastric low-grade MALT lymphoma in 76 patients with follow-up of at least 1 year (12-63 months, mean 28) is reported. No regression was found in five cases after 12-48 months. In one case surgical resection detected the involvement of perigastric lymph nodes overlooked by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Neither progression of the disease nor a high-grade component was documented by repeated gastric mappings, EUS and complete stagings in the other four cases. After histological remission five relapses of low-grade and one relapse of high-grade MALT lymphoma were found 12-48 months after eradication. Subsequent histological remission, without any additional therapy, was found in three relapsed cases. A rapid and persistent histological remission was obtained in 56 patients (73%). A late remission was observed in six cases. Monoclonal remission was found in half of the patients and was frequently delayed. Persistent monoclonality was associated with histological remission in the vast majority of patients. Our data confirm H. pylori eradication as the first choice therapy for early stage gastric low-grade MALT lymphoma and recommend extensive bioptic mapping and endoscopic sonography both in the local staging and in the regression evaluation. The rare cases of late remission encourage us to wait for at least 1 year after eradication of H. pylori. Longer follow-up studies will clarify the meaning of histological relapse/persistence and late remission. The study of non-responder cases could show us a step in lymphomagenesis."
CD009944,0,10802864,0,Primary gastric non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: requirements for diagnosis and staging.,"Tumor stage and histological grading (low grade vs. high grade) determine the prognostic outcome of primary gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Any diagnostic uncertainty of clinical staging may have potentially important therapeutic implications, especially if a non-surgical approach is favored. Diagnostic procedures for evaluation of gastric lymphoma include gastrointestinal endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound of the upper gastrointestinal tract, conventional abdominal and cervical ultrasound, thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans and bone marrow biopsy. In the present overview, the value of clinical diagnostic procedures is discussed with respect to clinical and endoscopic criteria which may be helpful for evaluation of gastric NHL. Furthermore, clinical staging methods such as endoscopic ultrasound are assessed which may allow pre-operative determination of tumor and lymph-node stage. These novel approaches are compared with the gold standard of pathohistological analysis. In conclusion, the diagnostic procedures presented appear to be helpful for establishing an early diagnosis, however, innovative methods such as endoscopic-bioptic mapping of the stomach and ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy techniques may improve pre-therapeutical work-up."
CD009944,0,10777153,0,Recent advances in endoscopic ultrasonography.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography is recognized as an important tool in the diagnosis and staging of esophageal, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and biliary tumors. It also is a reliable method for the evaluation of submucosal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, the differentiation between benign and malignant giant gastric folds, the evaluation of gastric ulcer healing, and the detection of common bile duct stones. The recent introduction of endoscopic ultrasonographic fine-needle aspiration provides for the cytologic and histologic diagnosis of gastrointestinal submucosal and extraluminal tumors and regional lymph nodes. This new technique may also be used for the intrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin in the treatment of achalasia, for the steroid injection treatment of refractory esophageal strictures, for celiac nerve block, for pseudocyst drainage, and for drug delivery into pancreatic tumors. High-frequency thin ultrasonic probes can be used to make a more accurate diagnosis of superficial carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract and for intraductal ultrasonography of the extrahepatic bile duct and pancreatic duct. In the future, three-dimensional imaging of gastrointestinal tumors will provide more accurate information regarding cancer extent. Endoscopic ultrasonography is a powerful tool which can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal diseases."
CD009944,0,10776880,0,Laparoscopic ultrasound enhances diagnostic laparoscopy in the staging of intra-abdominal neoplasms.,"Routine laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) for staging intra-abdominal malignancies remains controversial. Thus, we undertook a prospective study to assess the value of preoperative laparoscopy with LUS for patients with intra-abdominal tumors judged resectable by preoperative studies. Laparoscopy was successfully performed in 76 of 77 patients, and 60 underwent LUS. Of 33 patients with presumed pancreatic cancer, laparoscopic findings changed the operative management of 11 patients, and LUS altered the management of an additional 6 patients. Laparotomy was avoided in 9 patients (27%). Among 14 patients with hepatobiliary tumors, laparotomy was avoided in 9 patients in whom laparoscopy and/or LUS revealed either benign or advanced disease. Operative management was altered in 4 of 18 patients with gastric or esophageal cancer by laparoscopic findings. LUS did not add to the management of these patients. Of 12 patients with presumed intra-abdominal lymphoma, 9 were diagnosed with lymphoma and 3 with benign disease, without laparotomy in all but 1 case. Laparoscopy and LUS are valuable tools for evaluating the resectability of pancreatic and hepatobiliary tumors. Laparoscopy, and to a lesser degree LUS, greatly facilitates diagnosing patients with intra-abdominal lymphomas and spares an occasional patient with esophagogastric carcinoma from undergoing laparotomy."

Eradication of the infection with antibiotic therapy may result in regression of the lymphoma. But when antibiotic treatment fails to reverse the malignant process or if H. pylori is absent, other treatment options should be considered. Because MLS is often confined to the stomach and regional lymph nodes, it is potentially curable with local therapy.

CD009944,0,10717512,0,Endosonography in gastric lymphoma and large gastric folds.,"To establish a correct preoperative differential diagnosis between gastric lymphoma and cancer is essential but can be difficult as endoscopic biopsies can sometimes provide a low diagnostic yield. By EUS, infiltrative carcinoma tends to show a vertical growth in the gastric wall, while lymphoma tends to show mainly a horizontal extension. EUS provides an accurate staging of gastric lymphoma, showing the exact level of infiltration and the presence of perigastric lymph nodes, thus the physician can obtain an accurate prognosis for each patient and select the best form of treatment accordingly. The response to chemoradiotherapy can also be investigated very accurately by EUS. Large gastric folds are seen in a great number of benign and malignant conditions. Diagnosis represents a clinical challenge because etiology may be extremely varied and standard biopsies are often inconclusive. Different diseases show different levels of infiltration of the gastric wall, thus a characteristic echo-pattern helps for the differential diagnosis. Endosonography, used always in combination with biopsy, allows to rule out malignancies and to select the most appropriate treatment for each patient (medical or surgical)."

However, the large diameter results in an inability to negotiate the primary tumor in 25% of patients. The aim of this study was first to determine whether use of the 8-mm esophagoprobe would overcome this problem and second to evaluate the accuracy of the smaller diameter instrument. One hundred consecutive patients with esophageal cancer underwent initial gastroscopy. Based upon the degree of luminal stenosis, patients were staged with either the conventional echoendoscope (luminal diameter > or = 15 mm) or the esophagoprobe (luminal diameter < 15 mm). The primary tumor was successfully negotiated in all subjects (echoendoscope 30, esophagoprobe 70) so that T- and N-staging was accomplished in every patient. Esophageal dilatation was performed in 12 patients (12%). The procedure was well tolerated and there were no complications, in particular no patient suffered esophageal perforation. The accuracy of the esophagoprobe for T-staging was 90% (19 out of 20) and that for N-staging was 75% (15 out of 20). This was similar to the accuracy of staging with the conventional echoendoscope, 90% (9 out of 10) for T-stage and 90% (9 out of 10) for N-stage. The esophagoprobe can safely and accurately stage patients with esophageal carcinoma, including those with high-grade stenoses."

CD009944,0,10586017,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography in patients with gastro-esophageal cancer.,For patients with gastro-esophageal cancer ultrasonography (EUS) is superior to any other imaging modality in the assessment of local tumor infiltration and local lymph nodes status. EUS is especially important in the preoperative staging of patients with esophageal cancer and patients with proximal gastric cancer. Here it allows for the identification of those patients with advanced disease who are unlikely to benefit from surgery and in whom a conservative palliative treatment is indicated. In advanced gastric cancer the clinical implications of EUS less clear. Still preoperative EUS is indicated in every patient with cancer of the proximal stomach to assess tumor infiltration in the esophagus. Relatively new is the use of EUS in staging early cancers in order to select patients for local endoscopic treatment. High-frequency miniprobes are the instruments of choice for imaging these lesions. Strict criteria should be applied in the selection of patients for local endoscopic treatment of early gastro-esophageal cancers. EUS guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is currently only indicated in patients with esophageal cancer and suspicious celiac lymph nodes. It may become more important if new treatment protocols demand more objective and reliable assessment of lymph node status.

CD009944,0,10555667,0,Unusual gastric tumors: radiologic-pathologic correlation.,"The overlap of radiologic findings in many gastric tumors makes differentiation difficult. However, some unusual gastric tumors have characteristic radiologic features that may suggest a specific diagnosis. At barium study, lipomas typically manifest as a smooth submucosal mass or an ulcerated lesion with a ""bull's-eye"" appearance that is indistinguishable from other mesenchymal tumors. At computed tomography (CT), lipomas usually manifest as well-circumscribed submucosal masses with fat attenuation. At radiology, glomus tumors appear as smooth submucosal masses with or without ulceration and may contain tiny flecks of calcification. These tumors frequently demonstrate strong enhancement on early-phase contrast material-enhanced images. At barium study, lymphangiomas may appear as smooth intramural masses that are indistinguishable from other mesenchymal tumors. At CT, they manifest as non-enhancing extramucosal masses with homogeneous low attenuation. Diffuse lesions in Brunner gland hamartoma manifest as multiple small nodules, producing a characteristic ""cobblestone"" appearance. Lymphomas may have typical imaging features (eg, more pronounced and homogeneous mural thickening) that can help differentiate them from adenocarcinoma. In addition, adenocarcinomas may demonstrate unusual findings such as transpyloric spread, unusually large polyps, or intratumoral calcifications. Familiarity with these radiologic features of gastric tumors can help ensure correct diagnosis and proper management."

Staging is essential to select patients who will benefit from operation because palliation can also be performed nonoperatively. Several studies, including limited numbers of patients, have shown that laparoscopic staging prevents unnecessary laparotomies, but it is doubtful whether general application of this staging method can be advised. The aim of this study was to assess the benefit of diagnostic laparoscopy for staging patients with esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and hepatopancreatobiliary tumors."
CD009944,0,10549014,0,[Laparoscopy in the staging of cancer of the stomach].,"Prognosis of gastric carcinoma is closely related to extension. Laparoscopic staging of digestive cancers is proposed to evaluate the regional cancer spreading (TNM). The aim of this procedure is to avoid unnecessary laparotomy, and to reduce mortality and morbidity of these procedures. Laparoscopic staging can also make easier the selection of patients of preoperative treatment. In most of the series about laparoscopic staging, efficacy of the usual staging tools (computed tomography, ultrasonography, endoscopic ultrasonography) is weak and before operation 20 to 30% of the metastases, particularly peritoneal and hepatic, are missed. Laparoscopic staging is technically easy: no more than 3 trocars are necessary, laparoscopic ultrasonography may be performed during the same procedure, as well as peritoneal cytology. Feasibility is about 100%. Usual contraindications of the laparoscopy are contraindications of laparoscopic staging. The main difficulty is its utility. Staging of advanced lesions remains the best indication of laparoscopic staging in gastric cancer. Metastatic spread, particularly to the peritoneum, and resectability may be evaluated with sensitivity and specificity close to 90%. Morbidity (1 to 3%) is usually low and mainly represented by wound complications."
CD009944,0,10505006,0,Pre-operative staging of ampullary tumours by endoscopic ultrasound.,"Ampullary carcinomas have a significantly higher resectability rate and better prognosis than other periampullary carcinomas, although the prognosis is poor with advanced disease. Accurate tumour staging is therefore important in surgical planning. Our objective was to evaluate the usefulness of, and problems associated with, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the pre-operative staging of ampullary tumours. 35 patients with ampullary tumours were pre-operatively examined with EUS. The imaging results were compared with histopathological findings of the resected specimen according to the TNM staging classification. The overall accuracy of tumour (T) staging was 74% (26/35) for all tumours, and 67% (6/9), 71% (10/14) and 83% (10/12) respectively for T1, T2 and T3 tumours. The overall accuracy of nodal (N) staging was 63%. In diagnosing pancreatic invasion, EUS had an accuracy of 86% (30/35), a sensitivity of 83% (10/12), and a specificity of 87% (20/23). In conclusion, EUS provides an accurate method of evaluating the stage of ampullary tumours, especially infiltration into the pancreas.

After endoscopic and histological diagnosis, CT of the thorax and the abdomen is used. With the proof of local infiltration of a neighbouring organ or in the presence of distant metastasis, palliative therapy can be started. If CT is not conclusive or no local infiltration or distant metastasis is proven, endosonography should be performed. Gastric carcinoma: At present endosonography shows the highest accuracy for diagnosis of the T stage. For differentiation between T3 and T4 tumors the accuracy of CT is not sufficient to predict resectability. The N stage can be determined at present by no modality with sufficient accuracy. Distant metastasis can be diagnosed by CT with high sensitivity and specificity. Small bowel carcinoma: These rare tumors are diagnosed with high accuracy by enteroclysis, whereby the diagnosis takes place at a late stage due to the nonspecific clinical findings."

CD009944,0,10449680,0,Imaging diagnosis for staging of gastric cancer.,"A more differentiated therapy regimen concept for gastric cancer requires more precise pre-operative diagnostic imaging. There are several methods for pre-operative locoregional tumor staging in gastric cancer: percutaneous abdominal ultrasound with hydrotechnique (HUS), endoluminal ultrasound in the stomach (EUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The advantages and indications for each method are described and an overview of the medical literature is given. The results in the literature are compared to our own findings, which were obtained in prospective studies comparing the four different imaging methods. On the basis of our experience and the literature, we conclude that the indication for the different diagnostic imaging methods primarily depends on the type of therapy concept followed in the respective surgical department. Endoscopy with biopsy remains the primary diagnostic procedure. Endosonography (EUS) is another diagnostic procedure, which can be performed simultaneously with endoscopy. Only special questions or reasons warrant the use of other imaging methods."

CD009944,0,10408157,1,The utility and limitations of an ultrasonic miniprobe in the staging of gastric cancer.,"To determine the utility and limitations of an ultrasonic miniprobe (UMP) in the staging of gastric cancer, we evaluated 46 patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) using an UMP and who were histologically determined to have gastric cancers. In every case, UMP findings were compared with histopathological findings after treatment. The total accuracy of UMP relative to the depth of tumor invasion was 71.7% (33/46 cases). Accuracy with respect to T1-m tumor diagnosis was 75.7% (22/29 cases), and for T1-sm, 76.9% (10/13 cases), but accuracy for T2 tumor diagnosis was low, due to ultrasound attenuation. When the analysis was carried out based on the size of tumor, the accuracy for UMP was 50.0% (9/18 cases) for all tumors over 20 mm and 85.7% (24/28 cases) for all tumors smaller than 20 mm. We conclude that UMP is suitable for investigation of tumor extension when the lesion is superficial and/or small gastric cancers which do not cause ultrasonic attenuation, but not when the tumor is large or located in certain sites, although conventional EUS is useful in some of these cases."

Once computed tomography scan has ruled out distant metastases or evident local invasion, endoscopic ultrasonography plays a key role in an adjunctive evaluation and planning of treatment. The diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography in oesophageal cancer is excellent. Its main limitations are: poor differentiation between early mucosal and submucosal cancer, insufficient accuracy in detecting early lymph node invasion, and lack of complete tumour evaluation in cases of high-grade strictures. The role of endoscopic ultrasonography in post-treatment assessment is still limited by some artifacts. However, all these limitations will soon be overcome by some technical improvements."

Our knowledge about all aspects of these lymphoma has substantially increased during the last few years. Epidemiological, histomorphological, molecular-biological and experimental data clearly underline that Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric mucosa without doubt plays an important role both in the development and progression of MALT lymphoma. Considering histological malignancy (low grade and high grade lymphoma) and dissemination of the disease (stage) as decisive prognostic factors and therapeutical determinants, endoscopic bioptic diagnosis as well as endoscopic ultrasound are of major importance in establishing diagnosis and clinical stage. In the case of localized low grade lymphoma, eradication of Helicobacter pylori offers a promising therapeutic option.

CD009944,0,10068723,0,[Endoscopic resection of the digestive tract mucosa].,"The endoscopic resection of the mucosa of the digestive tract (ERM) is a set of techniques that have as their end the remotion of the mucosa for the diagnosis and treatment of localized diseases. The technique consists of the elevation of the mucosa with a submucosa injection of liquid or with suction in the interior of a transparent overtube. The procedure is indicated in the treatment of incipient malignant tumors of the esophagus, stomach, and colon, with a success rate that vacillates between 60 and 95%. An indispensable condition is the precise selection of patients through endoscopy and high-frequency endoscopic ultrasound. Other indications are the resection of flat and sessile polyps, the biopsies of submucosa tumors, and the taking of biopsies of great volume for the study of infiltrating and inflammatory neoplastic diseases. Based on the literature, principally descriptive and not comparative, the treatment of incipient digestive tract carcinomas with ERM has encountered serious difficulties in the Western world because of the rarity of the diagnosis, the scarce availability of endoscopic ultrasound, and lack of information of long-term results. On the other hand, in the diagnostic field of mucosa diseases, and in the treatment of polyps, its utility is evident. In conclusion, ERM is added to the new endoscopic techniques for the obtaining of specimens of great volume and for the resection of sessile polyps. In the treatment of malignant tumors, ERM should be used with caution."

Due to high-grade toxicity with EAP, the verification of this therapeutic concept in a randomized phase III study with a less toxic regimen had to be demonstrated in a second phase II study. A combination with cisplatinum, leucovorin and 5-FU in comparison to EAP was less toxic, but clinical response after chemotherapy was shown to be identical. Of 41 patients, 36 patients underwent surgery with a R0-resection rate of 73.2% (n = 26). After a median follow-up of 18.3 months, 23 patients with R0 resection were alive, 19 patients (73%) showed no evidence of recurrent disease. There was no major morbidity and no postoperative mortality observed. Thus, chemotherapy with cisplatinum, 5-FU and leucovorin seems to be suitable for a randomized multicenter trial sponsored by the EORTC. For entrance into the study the following requirements should be met: prospective diagnostic procedures including endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and surgical laparoscopy; standardised surgery (gastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy): prospective histopathological work up of the resected specimen including ypTNM category, ypUICC stages and R classification; prospectively scheduled follow-up intervals. Aim of the study, including 198 patients per treatment arm with a recruitment of 3 years and a minimum follow-up of 2 years, is the verification of the positive prognostic impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery compared with surgery alone in locally advanced gastric cancer (cuT 3cN1-3cM0)."

Most stage I cases are now entered into prospective trials to confirm the excellent results obtained with conservative treatment, whereas current therapeutic policies are based on accumulated experience. The limits of staging work-ups may have a significant impact on prospective trials and ordinary clinical practice. The authors explore the sensitivity of computed tomography scanning in detecting perigastric adenopathy in 20 patients with gastric MALToma treated by gastrectomy. Clinical staging identified 17 patients as having stage I MALTomas and three patients as having stage II1 MALTomas. Histopathologic staging showed that 8 of 17 patients formerly diagnosed with stage I MALToma had perigastric nodal involvement, whereas the three patients with clinical stage II1 were confirmed as such. Computed tomography scanning has low sensitivity in detecting perigastric lymphadenopathy in gastric MALTomas. This leads to understaging, with a significant impact on therapeutic decision, and distorts newly acquired knowledge about the disease's natural history and management, introducing a bias in prospective clinical trials. Endoscopic ultrasonography should be tested as a staging procedure both in prospective trials and in ordinary clinical practice."

It has proved feasible to visualize most anatomic structures in the upper abdomen consistently and in detail with laparoscopic ultrasonography. Recent publications indicate that laparoscopic ultrasonography may be useful for detecting small liver metastases, lymph node metastases, small primary tumors of the pancreas and bile ducts, and for the assessment of the local extension of tumors of the pancreas and stomach. The ongoing improvements in US technology and the results of larger studies will in the near future determine the precise place of this new imaging modality for staging of abdominal tumors."

Curative resection was performed in 114 patients, whereas the remaining 27 patients underwent palliative resection. Preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography and abdominal ultrasound were useful for the diagnosis of esophageal invasion and lymph node metastases. Particularly, the classification of paraaortic lymph node metastasis by ultrasound was important in deciding on the surgical method. Mediastinal lymph node metastases were found histologically in 19 of 68 patients. The survival of patients with mediastinal lymph node metastasis was poor. However, among them, a favorable outcome was expected for patients with few involved nodes and if only perigastric node involvement in abdominal nodes was found. Paraaortic lymph node metastasis was found histologically in 15 of 48 patients (27.9%). Two of 35-year survivors had 5 or fewer lymph node metastases, and showed only perigastric and paraaortic node involvement. It is equally important that tumor extension and lymph node metastases in the mediastinum and abdomen should be determined in the surgical treatment of advanced carcinoma of the cardia."

In this paper, diagnosis of these factors using endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and its accuracy are discussed. In 121 cases of gastric cancer in the cardiac area, EUS was performed and the findings compared with the pathological diagnosis. The depth of cancer invasion was accurately determined in 60% of mucosal cancer cases, 83% of cancer invading the submucosa, 50% of cancer invading the muscularis propria or the subserosa, 86% of cancer invading the serosa, 45% of cancer invading other organs, and overall accuracy was 77%. In cases of esophageal invasion sensitivity was 98%, specificity 93%, and overall accuracy 94%. In cases of lymph node metastasis specificity was 78%: 86% for N1 and 72% for N2. EUS therefore has an important role in diagnosis and selection of treatment."

CD009944,0,9840517,0,Staging of oesophageal carcinoma with high resolution endoluminal ultrasonography.,"Oesophageal carcinoma is a disease with poor prognosis despite improved treatment and diagnostic methods. The most important prognostic features are the degree of wall invasion and the presence of lymph node metastasis. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the region of 7.5-12 MHz has improved the accuracy of tumour staging. In the course of 1 year, 21 patients with oesophageal carcinoma were examined with 20 MHz high-resolution intraluminal ultrasonography (HRES). In 11 (52%) patients, both ultrasound catheter and fiber gastroscope could pass the tumour, in 5 (23%) only the ultrasound catheter could pass. In the remaining patients the ultrasound catheter could only partially pass without prior dilatation. One patient was classified as having a stage T2 tumour, 14 (67%) had T3 and 4 (19%) had T4. In 2 patients the tumour could not be fully classified but was at least T3 When comparing our results with findings at computed tomography (CT), the T stage coincided in 9 patients (42%), in 9 patients (42%) CT could not differentiate between T2 and T3 and in 3 investigations HRES showed a higher T stage than CT. In 3 patients (14%) ultrasonography found N1 stage where CT staged N0. In one patient, CT found lymph nodes not seen with HRES. Further studies comparing EUS, HRES and surgical findings are planned to assess our view that HRES is a useful method in preoperative staging of oesophageal carcinoma."

The calcification was not displayed by abdominal X-ray, CT, or conventional ultrasound. Only endoscopic ultrasonography displayed the distribution of calcification in vivo. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a slightly hypoechoic lesion with a high echoic line, without involvement of the fourth layer. Histopathologically, it was a IIc type early gastric cancer. The depth of cancer invasion was limited to the mucosa and a mucin pool was not observed. Psammomatous calcification was observed in the lumen of the carcinomatous glands. This seems to be the first case reported in which psammoma bodies were observed in early gastric cancer."
CD009944,0,9779628,0,Role of laparoscopic ultrasound in cancer management.,"Laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) has become an important tool in the staging of hepatic, pancreatic, and gastrointestinal malignancies.

CD009944,0,9779627,0,Laparoscopic evaluation in pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer continues to carry a poor overall prognosis. The majority of patients have advanced disease at the time of presentation. Dynamic, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) has become the radiographic study of choice in the pre-operative staging of patients with pancreatic cancer. While it has been shown to be highly sensitive in determining unresectability of peri-ampullary tumors, the ability of CT to predict accurately which tumors can be safely resected is still limited. Laparoscopic staging of peri-ampullary tumors is superior to dynamic CT in visualizing small liver and peritoneal metastases. The addition of laparoscopic ultrasound during laparoscopic staging enhances the ability of laparoscopy to determine resectability of these tumors and approaches the accuracy of open exploration without increasing significant morbidity or mortality. Patients who are deemed unresectable at the time of laparoscopy can undergo palliative biliary and/or gastric bypass procedures laparoscopically and further minimize the morbidity of laparotomy."
CD009944,0,9772061,0,Multimodality treatment for gastric carcinoid tumor with liver metastases.,"Carcinoid tumors are the most common neuroendocrine tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, and between 10% and 30% of these tumors are gastric in origin. Three types of gastric carcinoid tumors are recognized: type I, associated with chronic atrophic gastritis type A; type II, associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia; and type III, sporadic and the most malignant. We present a patient with an aggressive, sporadic-type gastric carcinoid that metastasized to the liver. Her symptomatic treatment included the somatostatin analog octreotide. Octreotide scintigraphy demonstrated that this tumor avidly bound the peptide. The patient's gastric carcinoid (assessed by endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound) regressed and she underwent hepatic artery embolization for her liver metastases. After initial partial CT resolution the tumor grew, compressing the inferior vena cava. The patient underwent orthotopic liver transplant with excellent recovery, although she was subsequently found to have two small lung metastases. She has responded well to adjuvant Indium-111 octreotide receptor targeted therapy. This case highlights the therapeutic options for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, including liver transplantation and adjuvant receptor targeted therapy."
CD009944,0,9765090,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography in large gastric folds.,"Large gastric folds are seen in a great number of benign and malignant conditions. Diagnosis is a clinical challenge because the etiology may be extremely varied and standard biopsies are often inconclusive. The gastric wall is considered thickened at endosonography when it is more than 3.6 mm in width. Different diseases show different levels of infiltration of the gastric wall. When abnormalities involve the second layer only, benign conditions can be considered and standard endoscopic biopsies are often diagnostic. When abnormalities involve layers two and three, different diseases can be suspected, including Helicobacter pylori infection and lymphoma; in this case large-particle biopsy should be considered. When abnormalities involve layer four, malignancy should be strongly suspected even if standard or large-particle biopsies are negative. Endosonography, always in combination with fine-needle or guillotine-needle biopsy, should be able to rule out malignancies and to select the most appropriate treatment for each patient."

CD009944,0,9765088,1,Staging of gastric cancer with endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic mucosal resection.,"Since it was found that the gastrointestinal wall is visualized as a five-layered structure corresponding to the histological layers of the wall, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has become recognized clinically as the most accurate method for diagnosing and assessing the local staging of gastric cancer. However, some problems have remained, including how to differentiate between cancer invasion and ulcer fibrosis, how to detect microinvasion, and how to recognize malignant lymph nodes. Using the pattern analysis for depressed-type gastric cancer, it is usually possible to distinguish between cancer invasion and ulcer fibrosis, except in cases of microinvasion into ulcer fibrosis or inadequate scanning. However, the sensitivity of EUS for evaluating metastatic lymph nodes is still problematic. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for early gastric cancer has been widely accepted as a standard treatment in Japan due to its minimal invasiveness. According to our data, the overall rate of radical resection was 68.3% (168 of 246), and 31.7% of the remaining patients additionally received laser treatment, surgery, or heater-probe treatment. There were no deaths owing to gastric cancer. Some lesions in which there was microinvasion of the submucosa were incorrectly diagnosed by EUS. It may be possible to solve this problem using three-dimensional EUS (3D-EUS) in the near future."

One hundred and nineteen patients with gastric cancer who received preoperative assessment by EUS underwent subsequent surgery. The endosonographic tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification was used for comparison with the histopathologic findings of the resected specimens. The ability of EUS to accurately predict the T stage (depth of tumor invasion) and N stage (involvement of lymph node) was 70% and 65%, respectively. EUS displayed a tendency to overestimate T stage and underestimate N state. The differentiation of early gastric cancer from advanced gastric cancer showed a concordance rate of 89% and underestimation rate of 8% and underestimation rate of 3%. The accuracy of EUS in predicting the stage T1 to T3, which correspond to D0 resectability (no macroscopic or microscopic tumor remains), was 91%. In conclusion, these results revealed EUS as a valuable tool for evaluating the local staging and resectability of gastric cancer. We suggest that EUS should be introduced in the preoperative assessment of patients with gastric cancer."
CD009944,0,9716038,0,Positron emission tomography for staging of oesophageal and gastroesophageal malignancy.,"Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) was prospectively investigated as a means of detecting metastatic disease in patients with oesophageal tumours and compared with computerized tomography (CT), with the surgical findings as a gold standard. Twenty-six patients with a malignant tumour of the oesophagus or gastroesophageal junction underwent CT and PET of the chest and the abdomen. Seven patients underwent laparoscopy to establish resectability. Fifteen patients underwent laparotomy without prior laparoscopy. Four patients did not undergo surgery. The primary tumour was visualized in 81% of patients with CT and in 96% with PET. Neither CT nor PET were suited to assess the extent of wall invasion. Surgically assessed nodal status corresponded in 62% with CT and in 90% with PET. Distant metastases were found in five patients with CT and in eight with PET. The diagnostic accuracy of CT in determining resectability was 65% and for PET 88%. For CT and PET together this was 92%. The present study indicates that FDG-PET can be of importance for staging patients with oesophageal tumours. PET has a higher sensitivity for nodal and distant metastases and a higher accuracy for determining respectability than CT. PET and CT together would have decreased ill-advised surgery by 90%."

We performed a comparative study of endosonographic findings of EBV-positive and -negative early gastric carcinomas. Epstein-Barr virus was detected in 11.8% (four of 34) of endosonographically observed early gastric carcinoma lesions. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a hypoechoic mass in the third layer, which reflected submucosal nodules, in 75% (three of four) of EBV-associated lesions. Endoscopically, in 66.7% (two of three) of EBV-associated carcinomas, the depressed lesion was surrounded by a raised margin covered with normal mucosa and was similar to a submucosal tumour (P < 0.05). Histologically, all three cases of EBV-associated lesions with submucosal tumour invasion had submucosal nodules of carcinoma with lymphoid stroma and 75% (three of four) were located in the gastric body. The ratio of maximal thickness to width of EBV-associated lesions was significantly larger than that of EBV-negative lesions, and this tendency was marked in lesions with submucosal tumour invasion (P < 0.05). This study indicated that EUS and endoscopy are of great use for the determination of EBV association with early gastric carcinoma."

These cases were thus examined clinicopathologically, including the extent of submucosal invasion. No lymph node metastasis was found in any of the cancers measuring less than 2 cm in diameter. Macroscopic type I lesions or various combined types (IIa + IIc, IIc + IIa, IIc + III) were more likely to infiltrate deeply and were also associated with a high incidence (18%-25%) of lymph node metastasis. No lymph node metastasis or vascular invasion was found in any simple type IIa lesions. The incidence of lymph node metastasis was 3% in simple type IIc cancers measuring 3 cm or less. In addition, submucosal microinvasion (sm1) simple type IIc cancers showed no accompanying lymph node metastasis or vascular invasion. We thus conclude that a full-thickness partial resection of the stomach, such as a laparoscopic local resection, is applicable to cancers measuring 3 cm or less provided that they are either simple macroscopic type IIa or simple type IIc sm1 cancers."

In view of histological malignancy (low or high grade) and dissemination of the disease (stage) as decisive prognostic factors and therapeutical determinants endoscopic-bioptical diagnosis as well as endoscopic ultrasound are of major importance. In case of localized low-grade lymphoma eradication of Helicobacter pylori offers a promising therapeutic option.

For this purpose 52 consecutive patients were examined by endosonography (7.5 and 12 MHz) and hydrosonography (3.75 MHz). Forty-nine of the 52 tumors could be examined by endosonography and 41 by hydrosonography. The T-staging accuracy rate of endosonography was 74% and 46% for hydrosonography. Carcinoma of the cardia are often classified as uT3 and hT3 preoperatively and pT2 postoperatively due to infiltration of the subserosal fat. The N-staging accuracy rate of endosonography was 86% and 61% for hydrosonography. Based on these results, transabdominal ultrasound in the hydrotechnique (hydrosonography) cannot replace endosonography in gastric cancer staging.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of EUS in the staging of esophageal carcinoma as well as its applicability and usefulness in tumors with nontraversable stenoses. EUS was performed in 43 patients with esophageal carcinoma. The technique was carried out with a radial echoendoscope under sedation with i.v. midazolam. Both, the infiltration of the tumor through the layers of the esophageal wall (T staging) and the presence of lymph nodes in different areas (N and M staging) were determined. In cases with nontraversable stenoses, only the proximal tumor margin was assessed by means of EUS. EUS showed T1 stage in only one case and more advanced stages in the remaining patients: T2 (n = 12), T3 (n = 22) and T4 (n = 4). We know the outcome of 28 patients, 14 of whom underwent surgery. In these patients, the sensitivity for T and N staging was 86% and 92% respectively, and the accuracy 86% in both. Both, T and N, were overstaged in one case (7%) and understaged in another (7%). The tumor caused nontraversable stenoses in 59% of patients (n = 26). In 4 patients the staging could not be assessed with sufficient reliability. In the subgroup of patients with nontraversable stenoses who underwent surgery, the accuracy of EUS when comparing with histopathology was 80%.

CD009944,0,9584570,0,[Stage-adapted radical principles in gastric carcinoma].,"The aim of any surgical approach to gastric carcinoma should be a complete resection with no residual tumor left behind, that is, a R0-resection according to UICC. Complete tumor resection in this respect refers to the primary tumor as well as to the lymphatic drainage and requires an adequate safety margin. The indications for surgical therapy of gastric cancer and the choice of procedure should consequently be guided by the tumor stage. This requires accurate preoperative staging, which can today be achieved with endoscopic ultrasonography and surgical laparoscopy. Gastric carcinoma stage IA (mucosa carcinoma) can be cured by local excision. In patients with tumor Stages IB (submucosa carcinoma), II, and IIIA, lymph node metastases are common. Based on the available data, this group of patients benefits from radical resection and D2 lymph node dissection. The overall 5-year survival rate of 50% for the large number of patients undergoing gastric resection for cancer seems to demonstrate convincingly the value of extended lymphadenectomy. In patients with advanced gastric carcinoma, that is, tumor stages IIIB and IV, a complete tumor removal usually can not be achieved by surgical dissection. Neoadjuvant therapeutic modalities should consequently be assessed in these patients. Based on tumor location and growth pattern, a total gastrectomy is the procedure of choice in patients with middle and proximal third gastric cancer. A subtotal gastrectomy may be performed in patients with tumors of the distal third and ""Laurens intestinal type"" growth pattern. The distal site of the main lesion must be investigated carefully to ensure that incidental concomitant lesions are not overlooked. Depending on the individual tumor situation, the gastrectomy can be extended toward varying portions of the distal esophagus or the pancreas, preserving splenectomy and resection of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The high incidence of locoregional recurrences and distant metastases after curative surgery for gastric cancer calls for improved locoregional control and systemic adjuvant treatment."

According to recent studies, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the most sensitive technique in measuring tumor infiltration (T-staging). In addition, although less reliable compared to the T-staging, the sensitivity of EUS in assessing lymph node status (N-staging) is superior to computed tomography and conventional ultrasound.

CD009944,0,9563443,0,Gastric cancer in Asia: progress and controversies in surgical management.,"Considerable controversy surrounds the management of gastric cancer and this has largely overshadowed recent progress in our understanding of the epidemiology and molecular pathogenesis of the disease, and improvements in diagnostic and staging techniques. Differences identifiable in the molecular pathogenesis of the 'intestinal' and 'diffuse' types of gastric cancer may help to unravel the biological behaviour of variants and ultimately influence therapeutic strategies. Endoscopic ultrasound is well established as being accurate for T staging and the introduction of laparoscopy, with or without ultrasound, is obviating unnecessary laparotomy in non-bleeding, non-obstructed patients. Controversies in surgery encompass the role of laparoscopic surgery in early gastric cancer, the extent of lymphadenectomy including para-aortic nodal dissection, resection of en bloc contiguous organ involvement, pancreatosplenectomy, left upper abdominal evisceration, and modes of reconstruction (pylorus-preserving gastrectomy, pouch formation) to enhance quality of life. Whereas adjuvant chemotherapy does not impact favourably on survival, emphasis has now shifted to neoadjuvant (induction) chemotherapy to downstage the disease. Preoperative regional chemotherapy and intra-operative hyperthermic chemotherapy or irradiation may prove to be of benefit in patients with resectable disease, but some scepticism still exists as to the usefulness of biological response modifiers (e.g. OK432, PSK) for adjuvant treatment. Ethical issues relating to cultural differences in Asia sometimes mitigate against adequate trial design (e.g. a surgery-alone control group or a no adjuvant therapy treatment group may be considered inappropriate) and this has understandably hindered acceptance in Western countries of the value of current management practices in Asia. These issues and the need for ongoing well-conducted randomized trials with prospective subset analysis are now being addressed."
CD009944,0,9544498,0,[Value of endosonography in diagnosis of diffusely growing stomach carcinomas].,"The diagnosis of diffuse type gastric carcinoma is very difficult. The delay of diagnosis is often due to false-negative endoscopic and histologic evaluation. The architecture of the stomach can be clearly visualized by endosonography. Therefore, already minor destructions of the gastric layers can be found. The endosonographic picture includes the presence of the layers, which are larger and of irregular contour. In infiltrating gastric cancer typically the submucosal layer and the muscularis are concentrically enlarged and appear folded. Based on the endosonographic picture diffuse type gastric carcinoma has been diagnosed in 32 patients. When compared to the histologic diagnosis after gastrectomy or autopsy the accuracy of the endosonographic diagnosis was 87.5%, (28 out of 32 patients). From the remaining four patients diagnosed to have diffuse type gastric cancer by endosonography three patients turned out to have malignant infiltrating tumors of different histologies. Therefore, the positive predictive value of endosonography in detection of infiltrating malignant tumors was 96.8% in our group. In contrast the accuracy of preoperative histologic diagnosis by biopsies was only 58%. Suspicious results of gastroscopy, especially in combination with a negative biopsy, should lead to further evaluation by endosonography to detect diffuse type gastric cancer earlier."

We describe the use of laparoscopic surgery to treat early gastric cancer. A 66-year-old man was diagnosed with early gastric adenocarcinoma by endoscopic ultrasonography and biopsy. Subtotal gastrectomy along with removal of the perigastric (D1) and selective extraperigastric lymph nodes over the celiac trunk was accomplished laparoscopically, through five punctures and a minilaparotomy. The patient's convalescence was uneventful. Bowel sounds were heard on postoperative day 1. On postoperative day 3, he passed flatus. The patient was started on a clear liquid diet on postoperative day 5. There was neither leakage nor obstruction after oral intake. He was discharged on postoperative day 11. No local recurrence or distant metastasis was found during 16 months' follow-up. This is the first report of successful laparoscopic resection of early gastric cancer with lymph node dissection in Taiwan."

The accuracy rate of the endosonography was 80% for T1 tumors an 83% for T4 tumors, and the sensitivity and specificity in the detection of regional involved lymph nodes were 91% and 84% respectively. Therefore endosonographic staging alone ist not a valuable pretherapeutic procedure to decide about endoscopic therapy in limited and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in extended gastric carcinoma."

The accuracy of both methods was comparable in esophageal cancer, whereas radial scanning was superior in gastric cancer. Generally radial scanning provided better spatial orientation and was easier to assess. An advantage of the longitudinal curved array scanner is the feasibility of EUS-guided biopsy."
CD009944,0,9451678,0,Diffuse cystic malformation and neoplasia-associated cystic formation in the stomach. Endosonographic features and diagnosis of tumor depth.,"We have evaluated the endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) features of cystic malformation of the stomach and the depth of associated neoplasia. We included 15 patients with multiple cystic components identified on EUS: 6 patients with multiple cysts restricted focally to gastric neoplasia and 9 patients with diffusely distributed cysts. We categorized the former findings as focal cystic malformation (FCM), and the latter as diffuse cystic malformation (DCM) of the stomach and reviewed the endosonographic features. Both FCM and DCM tended to show male preponderance and develop in older patients. Cystic changes in FCM extended from the neoplastic lesion to the submucosa regardless of the location in the stomach. Diffuse cystic malformation was located predominantly in the gastric body and mainly was shown as the thickened submucosa and/or deep mucosa with multiple cystic components. The boundary between the mucosal layer or the tumor echo and the submucosal layer was indistinct in eight patients, which led to a lower accuracy in EUS diagnosis of tumor depth. Diffuse cystic malformation has characteristic EUS features and occasionally is accompanied by gastric neoplasia. Endoscopic ultrasonography is inaccurate in determining tumor depth when multiple submucosal cysts are present."
CD009944,0,9383346,0,The use of laparoscopic ultrasound in the assessment of pancreatic cancer.,"26 consecutive cases of obstructive jaundice due to a carcinoma of the head of the pancreas were studied prospectively with ultrasound (US), computerized tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS). Sensitivity of US, CT were comparable, although CT seems better to evaluate the size of the tumor and for lymph node detection. 50 percent of patients had a criterion for noncurative resection. EUS (16 cases) had the best sensitivity (100 percent) for the staging of small tumors (less than 20 mm), detection of adjacent nodes and the relation between tumors- and mesenteric and portal vein. EUS was not able to detect peritoneal and/or liver micro-metastases. The criterion for noncurative resection was 57.6%. LUS exactly assessed all tumors larger than 2 cm. The accuracy compared with EUS was not as good for small tumors, but better concerning micro-peritoneal or hepatic metastasis. The criterion for noncurative resection was 80.7 percent. These results suggest to use of US and CT as first-line procedures in the preoperative staging and assessment of resectability of pancreatic cancers. When the patient does not appear to have disseminated lesions, EUS gives a good estimation of the size of the tumor, node assessment and vascular relations. LUS could be the first step for a curative surgical treatment. LUS revelated to discover 15 to 30 percent of unknown micro-metastases and avoided useless laparotomy in these patients."

CD009944,0,9247433,0,Portal vein thrombosis in the adult: surgical implications in an era of dynamic imaging.,"Extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (EHPVT) is the leading cause of variceal hemorrhage in patients with healthy livers; however, in an era of dynamic imaging, the incidental discovery of EHPVT places a special burden on the surgeon to understand the surgical implications of the disease in this setting. During the period 1989 to 1995, 23 patients (12 males and 11 females) were found to have EHPVT. In 20 (87%), this was an unexpected finding on ultrasound (11 of 23), abdominal CT scan (9 of 23), or both (9 of 23). In two patients, the diagnosis was suspected and confirmed with angiography, whereas in the other, the lesion was discovered at surgery. Only seven (30%) had hemorrhage as a presenting complaint. More typically (61%), abdominal pain alone or pain with sepsis was the indication for evaluation. In 20 patients (87%), there was an identifiable etiology for the EHPVT. A total of 15 operations were performed on 12 patients (52%), in 7 (4, variceal hemorrhage, and 3, bowel ischemia) as a direct consequence of the EHPVT and in five, for conditions not directly related to the EHPVT. Three of the 23 patients (13%) died, two (17%) following surgery and one (9%) from advanced malignant disease. No patients with hemorrhage (seven), even those who required a shunt for decompression (three) or devascularization (one), died. We found that the diagnosis of EHPVT is usually not related to variceal hemorrhage, but rather, abdominal symptoms that serve as an indication for the imaging study. Three subsets of patients emerged: (1) those requiring no surgery (11 patients), (2) those requiring surgery related to hemorrhage (4 patients), and (3) those requiring surgery for conditions other than varices (8 patients). In any of these circumstances, mortality (13%) was related to the underlying disease process rather than EHPVT. Given the earlier recognition of EHPVT, the natural history of the disease has been altered, with outcome reflecting the underlying disease rather than the sequelae of portal hypertension."
CD009944,0,9245882,1,Pre-operative TN staging of gastric cancer using a 15 MHz ultrasound miniprobe.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of and problems associated with a new endoscopically guided ultrasound miniprobe, used for pre-operative staging of gastric cancers. 59 cases of gastric cancer were prospectively examined with a 15 MHz ultrasound miniprobe. The results of the ultrasound imaging were compared with the histological findings of the resected specimens. The accuracy of the miniprobe for depth of invasion (T category) was 61% for all tumours, and 72% and 40%, respectively, for T1 and T2 to T4 lesions. If indeterminate cases due to ultrasound attenuation were excluded, the accuracy was improved to 82% for T1 and 57% for T2 to T4 tumours, respectively. The accuracy of the miniprobe for nodal staging (N category) was 69% overall, and 86%, 25% and 14% for stages N0, N1 and N2, respectively. In tumours classified on the basis of endoscopic types, the miniprobe staged early type gastric cancers (T category = 73%, N category = 80%) significantly (p < 0.01) more accurately than advanced ones (T category = 21%, N category = 36%). This study suggests that the miniprobe is indicated for pre-operative TN staging when endoscopy reveals an early gastric cancer."
CD009944,0,9245881,1,Relationship between histological type and endosonographic detection of regional lymph node metastases in gastric cancer.,"The aim of the study was to compare the ability of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in detecting lymph node metastases in differentiated and undifferentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. EUS was performed in 149 patients with differentiated or undifferentiated gastric cancer. Histopathological findings were compared with pre-operative EUS findings in a total of 2961 resected lymph nodes. The EUS detection rates of metastasis to individual nodes in relation to node size, the ratio of the metastasized area to the cross-sectional area of the node and to the depth of primary tumour invasion, were also investigated. The accuracy and negative predictive values of EUS for detecting metastatic lymphadenopathy in each patient were significantly higher for differentiated (87%, 94%) than for undifferentiated (71%, 71%) tumours. The detection rate of individual node metastasis was higher for differentiated (31%) than for undifferentiated (21%) tumours. For differentiated lesions, EUS detected more small nodal metastases (< 5 mm in diameter) (p < 0.01) and more nodes involved with a relatively small proportion of the metastasized area to the cross-sectional area of the node (< 1/3 involvement) (p < 0.05). In relatively superficial lesions, such as pT1 and pT2, the pre-operative EUS detection rate of metastatic nodes was higher for differentiated than for undifferentiated tumours. In conclusion, the ability of EUS to detect nodal metastases is related to the histological type of gastric cancer."
CD009944,0,9206626,0,"[Surgical relevance of preoperative diagnosis of tumors of the gastrointestinal tract--decision making in esophageal, stomach, colon and rectal carcinoma].","The increasing spectrum of therapeutic options for tumors of the gastrointestinal tract has resulted in a refinement of the pretherapeutic diagnostic strategies. The diagnostic approach in surgical institutions that are focused on primary surgical resection will therefore be much less sophisticated than in institutions who propose a selective therapeutic approach based on the pretherapeutic tumor stage and prognostic parameters. Pretherapeutic assessment of the depth of tumor infiltration, i.e. the T-category, is essential because most further diagnostic and therapeutic decisions are based on this information. This can today be achieved with a high degree of accuracy by endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography. Early T-stages (T1-2) are usually an indication for primary surgical resection and, after exclusion of distant metastases, no further diagnostic studies are required. In patients with locally advanced esophageal, gastric or rectum tumors (T3-4) multimodal therapeutic concepts should be considered. This usually requires additional diagnostic studies. None of the available diagnostic imaging modalities today allows satisfactory pretherapeutic assessment of lymph node metastases. The assumed nodular status should therefore currently not influence therapeutic decisions. Essential is, however, the assessment of distant metastases, since the documentation of distant tumor spread will change the therapeutic approach to a palliative situation. Detailed histologic and molecular-biologic assessment of tumor characteristics is growing in importance. This not only provides therapeutically relevant information regarding tumor grading, but opens the door towards a modern molecular diagnostic approach. It can be expected that in the near future a vast amount of relevant prognostic information can be obtained from endoscopic tumor biopsies, which may soon alter our therapeutic concepts."

The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the most frequent extranodal site of the disease. The optimal therapy for HIV-related lymphoma remains a matter of controversy. In a retrospective analysis we found gastrointestinal lymphoma in ten of 306 HIV-infected patients (3.3%) with a median CD4-count of 92/microliter at time of diagnosis. Median survival for the chemotherapy treatment group was 15 months. The high incidence of gastrointestinal NHL prompted us to commence a prospective survey on diagnostic procedures, therapy and outcome of patients with HIV-infection and gastrointestinal symptoms. 93 of 341 HIV-infected patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were examined by endoscopy. In selected patients we used in addition endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for visualization and staging before and after chemotherapy. NHL of the GIT was detected in seven of 93 endoscopically examined patients (7.5%). All patients were treated with CHOP initially. Mean survival time was ten months, mean CD4-count at diagnosis 193/microliter (range 0-417). Our results indicate that the diagnosis of gastrointestinal lymphoma should be considered in any HIV-infected patient presenting with unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms. In this group of patients NHL was detected in 7.5% of cases. The use of EUS improves the staging procedure before therapy. Treatment with CHOP resulted in relatively high remission rates and was associated with a low rate of treatment-induced myelosuppression."

In 110 resected adenocarcinomas, the proportion of intestinal-type cells increased with progression, as assessed by depth of invasion. The coincidence rate for gastric and intestinal phenotypic expression in biopsied and resected specimens was 96.3%. The positive predictive value of assessment of depth of invasion by ES was 73%. A low positive predictive value (45%) was achieved with type II-3 cases (according to our classification). However, the predictive value improved to 68% when depth of invasion was evaluated as the submucosal layer or deeper in cases in which more than 10% of cancer cells were of intestinal-type, although statistical analysis showed no significant difference between these predictive values. The sensitivity of diagnosis of submucosal invasion by cell differentiation in the type II-3 cases was significantly higher than that for the other types (89.5% versus 59.1%; P = 0.037). Phenotypic expression in biopsied specimens of gastric carcinomas proved helpful for evaluating the depth of invasion of gastric carcinoma by ES."
CD009944,0,9074915,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography for esophageal and gastric mass lesions.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography is a relatively new and evolving imaging modality incorporating endoscopy and ultrasonography into one comprehensive examination of the gut wall. Its principal indication has been the locoregional staging (T and N) of gastrointestinal tumors, particularly of the esophagus and stomach. Accuracy of conventional radiographic modalities (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) has been disappointing (50-60%). Alternatively, the staging accuracy of the depth of tumor penetration (T stage) approaches 85-90% in most series, whereas that for lymph node assessment (N stage) has been in the 70-80% range. The precise stage of upper gastrointestinal neoplasms provides accurate pretreatment assessment of the patient's prognosis and may influence therapeutic decisions. Endosonography is also the diagnostic modality of choice in the evaluation of submucosal tumors. It can demonstrate size, layer of origin, and, by its echo texture, can accurately predict etiology of the neoplasm. The only limitation may be in the differentiation of benign from malignant smooth muscle tumors."

After examining the histological characteristics and classification of primary gastric lymphomas, the authors underline the importance of an early preoperative diagnosis of gastric lymphoma. The repeated use of endoscopic techniques with biopsy compared to radiological examination increases the possibility of diagnosing lymphoma from 20% to 85%. The success rate is further increased if ultrasonic endoscopy is used instead of endoscopy alone, thus making it possible to achieve a 97% diagnostic success rate. The authors then emphasise the fundamental role played by surgery in the treatment of gastric lymphoma. Depending on the depth of neoplastic infiltration, the dimensions of the neoplasia and its multifocality, in localised forms of the antrum (IE, IIE with a low degree of malignancy) surgery consists of resection with partial gastrectomy, provided the resection margins are undamaged, or total gastrectomy in those forms involving the fundus and body of the stomach."

An improvement in this situation is best accomplished by preoperative treatment modalities to increase the R0 resection rate and by preoperative and postoperative treatment to reduce local recurrences and distant metastases. For LAGC, which includes approximately two thirds of patients with locoregionally confined tumors, preoperative chemotherapy (CTx) represents a promising approach. Among a group of patients with surgically or clinically staged unresectable LAGC, approximately half underwent R0 resection after downstaging induced by active CTx. The long-term survival of these patients seems to be improved. Even in patients who had primarily unresectable tumors as defined by explorative laparotomy, the long-term survival was about 20% after preoperative CTx and subsequent surgery. Based on these experiences, randomized trials investigating preoperative CTx versus surgery alone are clearly needed to define whether such an approach has an impact on RO resection rates and survival of patients with LAGC. Preconditions for such trials are clinical staging procedures, including endoscopic ultrasonography (T category) and surgical laparoscopy plus lavage (excluding peritoneal carcinomatosis), and a standardized surgical procedure."

The accuracy of tumour and nodal staging using both modalities was compared to the final histological staging of the resected specimens. In staging depth of tumour growth, EUS was significantly more accurate (87% of lesions correctly staged) than CT (40% correctly staged). In staging nodal involvement, EUS was again significantly more accurate (73% correctly staged) than CT (33%). Two-thirds of the lesions were traversable with the endoscopic probe, but most of the nontraversed lesions were correctly staged on EUS. In this study, CT has performed poorly as a staging modality for carcinoma at the gastro-oesophageal junction. Other studies have shown CT to be less accurate at this location than at other oesophageal sites. The orientation of the gastro-oesophageal junction, lack of surrounding fat planes, proximity of adjacent organs and patient motion contribute to the poor staging performance of CT at this location. In contrast, EUS has been an accurate staging modality at the gastro-oesophageal junction in this study and compares well with other studies evaluating EUS in the more proximal oesophagus. Endoscopic ultrasound is therefore a necessary modality if accurate pre-operative staging of gastro-oesophageal junction carcinoma is to be achieved."
CD009944,0,8803568,0,The use of endoscopic ultrasonography in the evaluation and diagnosis of gastric lesions.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography within the stomach can provide high resolution images of the gastric wall as well as adjacent lesions that cannot be achieved with other diagnostic modalities. Clinically important uses include the evaluation of submucosal tumors, thickened gastric folds, changes seen with portal hypertension, and the staging of gastric malignancy. Two basic principles should be considered when applying this modality in clinical practice. The first is that for any test to be considered truly indicated, the results should have some significant impact on management decisions and/or quality of life for the individual. The second is that endosonographic imaging is not a substitute for histology, but findings may have a direct impact on the need for and methods of obtaining biopsy material."

CD009944,0,8797970,0,Primary tumour staging of gastric and colorectal cancer.,"Almost 15 years after its introduction, endosonography or endoscopic ultrasonography is an important technique in a wide range of gastrointestinal diseases. Other imaging techniques are CT, MRI and barium examination. There is a general consensus that the most important prognostic factor in gastric and colorectal carcinoma is the presence or absence of lymph node invasion, but malignant fixation of tumour through direct invasion of adjacent tissues also appears to be very important. Non-invasive preoperative assessment of tumour stage based on one or a combination of the above imaging modalities should allow appropriate treatment to be planned in each case."

CD009944,0,8696704,0,Short communication: detection of early scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach by endoscopic ultrasonography.,The endoscopic ultrasonography (US) characteristics of early scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach (ESS) were evaluated in four patients. ESS was defined as the presence of poorly differentiated carcinoma cells spreading through the submucosa and muscularis propria in association with a marked desmoplastic reaction without serosal invasion. ESS was characterized by localized irregular hypoechoic enlargement of the third (submucosal) and the fourth (muscularis propria) layers. The fifth (serosal) layer was normal. The third and fourth layers showed a threefold increase in thickness compared with the thickness of these layers in healthy subjects. Our results suggest that endoscopic US is useful for diagnosis of ESS.

Sixty-nine consecutive patients who received preoperative CT and EUS underwent subsequent surgery. CT and EUS results were compared with histopathologic staging of tumor invasion depth and regional lymph node metastasis (pT and pN categories). T categories were staged correctly in 42% of the cases by CT, 71% by EUS and 55% by intraoperative surgical assessment. CT correctly staged 49% of N1 and N2 lymph nodes compared with 65% for EUS and 45% for intraoperative surgical assessment. CT was more accurate for advanced cancer but had a tendency to understage the T and N categories. EUS was more accurate for serosal cancer and displayed a tendency to overstage T categories and understage N categories. Intraoperative surgical assessment overstaged early T stages, understaged the T4 stage and had a tendency to overstage N categories. CT and intraoperative surgical assessment of T and N categories were of limited value in the staging of gastric carcinoma compared to EUS. EUS is a valuable form of assessment to evaluate gastric cancer staging before surgery."

CD009944,0,8658218,0,Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound in the staging of gastric cancer.,"As patients with gastric cancer are offered choices between surgical resection, investigational neoadjuvant chemotherapy, palliative chemotherapy, or symptomatic relief alone, the need for accurate preoperative staging becomes apparent. Laparoscopy has been suggested as an accurate staging modality in a variety of upper gastrointestinal malignancies. It allows for assessment of the stage of the primary tumor, identification of hepatic or regional nodal metastases, and the detection of small volume peritoneal disease unappreciated by other noninvasive staging modalities such as computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or endoscopic ultrasound. This article reviews the current literature concerning laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) in the staging of gastric cancer. The Memorial Hospital experience with 92 patients is described. In this group, metastatic disease unappreciated by conventional staging modalities was found in 31 cases. The preliminary experience with LUS suggests that its addition to standard laparoscopy increases the sensitivity and specificity of M1 screening as well as introducing T and N staging capabilities."
CD009944,0,8658217,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography.,"Optimal treatment of gastric carcinoma requires accurate staging as there are marked differences in the prognosis of early and advanced gastric cancer which influence the decision for surgical resection versus nonsurgical palliation. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), by virtue of its considerable accuracy, has become the method of choice for regional staging of gastric cancer. EUS is unique in its ability to image the gastric wall as a 5-layer structure that correlates with actual histological layers. Thus, tumor depth can be imaged very precisely. Peritumor inflammation is the most common cause for overstaging by EUS; difficulty in determining tumor involvement of, but not through, the subserosa is another important reason for inaccurate staging. EUS is able also to detect small lymph nodes in the perigastric region. Although assessment of malignancy in nodes can be difficult, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology appears to be an accurate method to determine lymph node status. Surgery remains the standard treatment for gastric cancer, but new methods of endoscopic resection combined with high-frequency ultrasound may hold promise for future treatment of early gastric cancer. In addition to current radial and sector scanning instruments, recently introduced high-frequency ultrasound probes enhance the diagnostic possibilities of this technology."

CD009944,0,8731844,0,[The role of endoscopic ultrasonography and epidermal growth factor receptor assay in preoperative staging for gastric carcinoma].,Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed in 36 patients with gastric carcinoma and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of the specimen from endoscopic biopsy in 19 patients with gastric carcinoma was measured with immunoassay. Results of EUS were compared to the pathology of resected specimens according to the new (1987) TNM classification. EUS was very accurate in assessing the depth of tumor infiltration and the lymph node metastasis. Overall accuracy in T and N stage were 81% and 72% respectively. The level of EGFR in patients with infiltration into the neighbouring organs (97.7 +/- 27.9 fmol/mg pro.) were significantly higher than those without infiltration (47.7 +/- 21.3 fmol/mg pro.) (P < 0.01). The EGFR levels of those with lymph node metastasis (85 +/- 24.3 fmol/mg pro.) were significantly higher than that without lymph node metastasis (37.1 +/- 16.1 fmol/mg pro.) (P < 0.01). The results show that EUS as well as the EGFR assay could be used to determine the progress and prognosis of gastric carcinoma.

We report here on our preliminary experience with a new method of endoscopic MRI in the upper gastrointestinal tract."
CD009944,0,8554267,0,[Imaging of cancer of the esophagus: ultrasound-endoscopy or computed tomography?].,"The aim of this retrospective study, in 100 patients who had an esophagectomy from 1987 to 1992 for squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus, was to determine the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and computed tomography (CT) in the preoperative staging of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The EUS report were compared to the pathological findings for the T stage. Both EUS and CT reports were compared with surgical and pathological findings for N stage (N0/N1) and mediastinal extension. In the 100 patients, EUS accuracy for T stage was 80%; EUS was more accurate for N stage than CT (71% vs 55% respectively; p < 0.02), and as accurate as CT for mediastinal extension (86% vs 85%). In the 26 SCC estimated superficial by EUS (all passed through), EUS accuracy was 92% for T stage and 77% for the distinction between mucosal and submucosal tumours; for N stage, EUS and CT accuracies were equivalent (77% vs 81%). In the 44 SCC passed and estimated advanced by EUS, EUS accuracy for T stage was 68%; EUS was more accurate than CT for N stage (77% vs 48%, p < 0.01) and as accurate as CT for mediastinal extension (86 vs 84%). In the 30 SCC not passed by EUS, accuracies of EUS and CT were equivalent for N stage (57% vs 47%) and for mediastinal extension (73% vs 73%). This study suggests that: a) for SCC estimated superficial by EUS, EUS does not differentiate reliably mucosal from submucosal tumors and CT is useless; b) routine EUS seems unnecessary for SCC not passed through by endoscopy; c) CT is still useful in patients with advanced SCC, mainly for detection of distant metastases."
CD009944,0,8535621,0,Staging of pancreatic cancer. Analysis of literature results.,Staging of pancreatic cancer is still considered to be one of the most difficult areas of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in gastroenterology. Variable scanning planes to obtain images of the tumor and its relationship to surrounding structures and vessels as well as a variety of possible artifacts in the scanning of pancreatic tumors greatly contribute to these difficulties. This review attempts to cover all relevant aspects of the literature regarding pancreatic cancer staging.
CD009944,0,8528972,0,Surgical therapy for gastric cancer.,"The aim of any surgical approach to gastric carcinoma should be a complete resection with no residual tumor left behind, that is, a R0-resection according to the UICC. Complete tumor resection in this respect refers to the primary tumor as well as the lymphatic drainage and requires an adequate safety margin. The indications for surgical therapy of gastric cancer and the choice of procedure should consequently be guided by the tumor stage. This requires accurate preoperative staging, which can today be achieved with endoscopic ultrasonography and surgical laparoscopy. Gastric carcinoma stage IA (mucosa carcinoma) can be cured by local excision. In patients with tumor stages IB (submucosa carcinoma), II, and IIIA, lymph node metastases are common. Based on the available data, this group of patients benefits from radical resection and D2 lymph node dissection. In patients with advanced gastric carcinoma, that is, tumor stages IIIB and IV, a complete tumor removal usually can not be achieved by surgical resection. Neoadjuvant therapeutic modalities should consequently be assessed in these patients. Based on tumor location and growth pattern, a total gastrectomy is the procedure of choice in patients with middle and proximal third gastric cancer. A subtotal gastrectomy may be performed in patients with tumors of the distal third and ""Laurén's intestinal type"" growth pattern. Depending on the individual tumor situation, the gastrectomy can be extended toward varying portions of the distal esophagus or a pancreas, preserving splenectomy and resection of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009944,0,7895567,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer.,"The accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for diagnosis of pancreatic cancers was evaluated in consecutive 232 patients with possible pancreatic cancer, and that for assessment of their locoregional spread was evaluated in 28 patients with pancreatic cancer subjected to pancreatectomy, in comparison with the accuracies of transabdominal ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT). EUS was found to be significantly more accurate than US or CT and was especially useful for detecting small pancreatic cancers of less than 2 cm in diameter. With EUS, pancreatic cancers could be detected as a hypoechoic mass with a relatively unclear margin and irregular internal echoes. EUS was also more sensitive than CT and US for detecting venous and gastric invasions: it was more useful for detecting direct invasion of pancreatic cancers when the tumors were less than 3 cm in diameter. These findings indicate that EUS is an accurate method for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and assessment of their locoregional spread and is particularly useful for detecting small tumors."

The subsequent operation revealed that the strip biopsy had resulted in radical resection. A 55-year-old woman visited our hospital for detailed examination of a small gastric lesion. Histologic findings of the specimens obtained by conventional forceps biopsy indicated reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, although the possibility of malignant lymphoma was not completely ruled out. Strip biopsy was, therefore, performed to establish a definitive diagnosis. Histopathological examinations of the strip biopsy specimen revealed definitive findings of malignant lymphoma, which was B-cell phenotype immunocytochemically. The margin of the resected specimen was free of invasion by malignant lymphoma and no lymph node involvement was suggested by endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography, and gallium scintigram. Subtotal gastrectomy was subsequently performed to rule out the possibility of remaining malignant lymphoma cells. It was proven that the strip biopsy removed the lesion completely and no perigastric lymph nodes were involved. While is still controversial as to whether strip biopsy should be adopted for the radical resection of early gastric lymphoma, this procedure can definitely provide excellent specimens for the accurate diagnosis of gastric malignant lymphoma and probably for group III lesions in the stomach."

In 1987 a selective proximal vagotomy was performed. Because of non-specific gastric symptoms in 1993 an endoscopy and an endoscopic ultrasound was performed at another hospital which resulted in the likely diagnosis of multiple leiomyomas. Three months later a control endosonography showed three well demarcated submucosal tumors, partly echo-genic, but with an inhomogeneous echo-pattern. A laparotomy and histological examination of the submucosal gastric tumors revealed multiple gastric abscesses with granulomas after selective proximal vagotomy. Difficulties in the differential diagnosis of submucosal gastric tumors arising from this case are demonstrated and discussed."
CD009944,0,7754626,0,Potentially resectable gastric carcinoma: current approaches to staging and preoperative therapy.,"The incidence of gastric carcinoma has declined worldwide during the past several decades, and yet this cancer remains the most common malignancy in several countries around the world, particularly Japan, Chile, and Costa Rica. Gastric carcinoma, although not as common in the United States as it was in the past, is still the eighth most frequent cause of cancer death. For patients with localized gastric carcinoma, surgery remains the most effective therapy, resulting in a consistent but low rate of cure. Unresectable gastric carcinoma is an incurable disease with the exception of a small fraction of patients who are salvaged with chemoradiotherapy. In Western countries curative resection rates have been dismal because of the lack of early diagnosis. Additionally, postoperative adjuvant strategies in the United States and Europe have been ineffective. Even patients with curative resection frequently develop intraperitoneal and systemic carcinoma in addition to locoregional relapses. Many investigators have therefore embarked on the therapeutic strategies of preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The preoperative chemotherapy strategy has particular appeal because of its potential to reduce the size of the primary tumor, thereby allowing a higher rate of curative resection; early systemic therapy of micrometastases might prove biologically more effective. To date, several studies using preoperative chemotherapy have demonstrated its feasibility. The effectiveness of repeated courses of postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy remains unsettled mainly owing to the inadequacy of peritoneal drug distribution and the associated toxic effects. Additional investigations are necessary to improve preoperative staging with the use of endoscopic ultrasonography and laparoscopy (peritoneal staging).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009944,0,7754625,0,Preoperative chemotherapy for unresectable gastric cancer.,"Even with extended surgery, including systematic lymphadenectomy of the lymph node compartment II, only half of the patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC), which comprises stages IIIA, IIIB, and IV, undergo a macroscopic and microscopic tumor-free resection (i.e., R0 resection, according to UICC 1987/AICC 1988). An improvement of this situation is best accomplished by preoperative treatment modalities to increase the R0 resection rate and by preoperative and postoperative treatment to reduce local recurrences and distant metastases. For LAGC, which includes approximately two-thirds of patients with locoregionally confined tumors, preoperative chemotherapy (CTx) represents a promising approach. Among a group of patients with surgically or clinically staged unresectable LAGC, approximately half underwent R0 resection after down-staging induced by active modern CTx. The long-term survival of these patients seems to be improved. Even in patients who had primarily unresectable tumors as defined by an explorative laparotomy, the long-term survival was about 20% after preoperative CTx and subsequent surgery. Based on these experiences, randomized trials investigating preoperative CTx versus surgery alone are clearly needed to define whether such an approach has an impact on R0 resection rates and survival of patients with LAGC. Preconditions for such trials are clinical staging procedures, including endoscopic ultrasonography (T category) and surgical laparoscopy plus lavage (excluding peritoneal carcinomatosis), and a standardized surgical procedure."
CD009944,0,7728350,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography of the pancreas.,"The pancreas is the most technically demanding area to image with EUS. This technique, however, has found a clinical niche in evaluating patients with pancreatic cancer to determine resectability and likely will play a prominent role in the future in diagnosis through ultrasonographically directed FNA. Its role in localization of neuroendocrine tumors is established as long as preoperative localization is important in management. It is unlikely that a competing technology will develop in the near future with resolution the same or better than EUS. The role of EUS in the evaluation of early chronic pancreatitis is still under investigation, but it is likely that it can play a role adjunctive to ERCP. If FNA can be demonstrated to be safe and the interpretation of the cytology is accurate, then EUS could play an important role in this area. In the future, EUS may be used to acutely aspirate pancreatic pseudocysts and potentially could be useful in differentiating pseudocysts amenable to endoscopic drainage versus those that would be managed best by percutaneous or surgical drainage. With some design modifications, it may be feasible in the future to use ultrasonographic guidance to puncture pseudocysts and then place nasocystic drains or internal stents. These areas will need further investigation and further technological development."

In initially negative biopsy for linitis, EUS can help the clinician in selecting the optimal site for positive biopsy. In gastric NHL, EUS can be helpful in selecting the appropriate candidate for surgery and in monitoring the response to chemotherapy and irradiation.

However, the proportion of agreement is satisfactory for distinguishing tumors that invade the mediastinal or the perirectal fat from those that do not, a situation that may be the most relevant from a therapeutic point of view. In cases of cardioesophageal tumor, agreement for metastatic LN is lower and depends on the sites involved, with the best agreement for intra-abdominal LN, which may indicate a worse prognosis.

Endoscopic therapy for early gastric cancer included strip biopsy, laser irradiation, and OK-432 injection. Examination of the depth of cancer invasion in the strip biopsy specimens showed that the diagnostic accuracy of EUS was 85.7%. Complete resection rate in strip biopsy was 82.8%, and the patients with incompletely resected cancer were successfully treated with laser irradiation and/or OK432 injection. The prognosis of the patients treated with strip biopsy was good. Three patients died of causes other than gastric cancer. Local recurrence and a heterochronous new lesion developed in six patients, but all of these cases were successfully treated with additional strip biopsy.

CD009944,0,8539469,0,[The role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis and staging of gastroenteric lymphoma].,"Ultrasonography (US) plays an important role in the diagnosis, staging and follow-up of gastrointestinal lymphomas particularly when associated with complementary techniques such as echo-guided biopsy and endoscopic ultrasonography. Besides the well-known ultrasonographic ""pseudo-kidney"" image as sign of gastrointestinal pathology, the ""spoke wheel"" image is suggestive of gastroenteric lymphoma. This lesion is due to the lymphomatous infiltration of intestinal wall that looks ipoechoic compared to the iperechoic lumen. An early abdominal US study performed after clinical suspicion, should allow a presumptive identification of the enteric tract involved on the basis of the relationship between the ""pseudokidney"" image and the other abdominal organs. US study of the abdomen may be useful also to demonstrate enlarged retroperitoneal or visceral lymph nodes both in primary gastroenteric or systemic lymphomas. Fine needle biopsy (FNB) of deep lymph nodes is mandatory when superficial enlarged lymph nodes are not found showing a specificity and sensitivity of 100% and 66% respectively. The typical image of gastric wall on endoscopic US is constituted of five layers; the second one represents the lamina propria with the lymphatic tissue. The thickness increase of this layer suggest the diagnosis of gastric lymphoma. Therefore the endoscopic US examination is particularly important when the endoscopic features and the endoscopic biopsies are negative. Finally endoscopic US may be used to guide FNB of gastrointestinal tract lesions."

CD009944,0,8174983,0,Localisation of neuroendocrine tumours of the upper gastrointestinal tract.,"In order to localise neuroendocrine tumours of the foregut type (that is, of the stomach, duodenum, and pancreas), 18 patients were studied prospectively by endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography, transabdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. These 18 patients had a total of 25 primary tumour lesions which were verified histologically in tissue obtained by surgery or by ultrasound or endoscopy guided biopsy. Tumours were found in the stomach (n = 1), duodenum (n = 6), pancreas (n = 17), and liver (n = 1). Endoscopic ultrasonography had the highest sensitivity for tumour detection, followed by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, computed tomography, transabdominal ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (88%, 52%, 36%, 32%, and 24% respectively). Endoscopic ultrasonography was especially sensitive in tumours smaller than 2 cm in diameter (88% v somatostatin receptor scintigraphy 35%; computed tomography 12%; transabdominal ultrasonography 6%; and magnetic resonance imaging 0%). Of 17 tumours located in the pancreas, endoscopic ultrasonography showed a sensitivity of 94% (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy 47%; computed tomography 47%; transabdominal ultrasonography 41%; and magnetic resonance imaging 29%). Of eight extrapancreatic tumours, six were identified by endoscopic ultrasonography, five by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, and only one by computed tomography, transabdominal ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. One neuroendocrine tumour that was not detected by endoscopic ultrasonography was correctly identified by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Endoscopic ultrasound allowed correct determination of the tumour size and tumour spread into parapancreatic structures, especially the large vessels (T stage), in all 14 patients operated upon. The lymph node stage (N stage) was correctly determined in 10 of these 14 patients. In summary, endoscopic ultrasonography and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy were the most sensitive imaging methods for the localisation of these tumours and should be used as early diagnostic procedures to accurately stage neuroendocrine tumours of the foregut type."

Endoscopic ultrasonography often establishes a diagnosis in malignant and, in certain patients, benign disease; accurately evaluates anastomoses for recurrent tumor; and characterizes submucosal masses. When histology is required, endoscopic ultrasonography has a critical role in defining an abnormal area for deep submucosal biopsy from the gastrointestinal lumen. Endoscopic ultrasonography is unsurpassed in determining resectability of gastrointestinal neoplasms. It can be used to monitor treatment of downstaged tumors prior to attempted resection. Using endoscopic ultrasonography for earlier diagnosis and precise staging will significantly improve the clinical outcome of patients with gastrointestinal disease as significant advances both in surgical techniques and in combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy continue to be made and applied selectively."
CD009944,0,8052089,0,[Primary stomach lymphoma of the MALT type. Diagnosis and therapy. Gastrointestinal Lymphoma Study Group].,"Primary gastric lymphoma are nowadays considered as a distinct lymphoma entity. Their classification is based on the concept of MALT (Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue). Within the gastrointestinal tract, the stomach is most frequently involved. In the pathogenesis of gastric lymphoma, Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis plays an important, conditioning role. Usually, the diagnosis of gastric lymphoma can be established on the basis of endoscopic biopsies. Endoscopic ultrasound seems highly useful for differentiating the depth of lymphoma infiltration and for evaluating the perigastric lymph nodes. Options in the therapy of gastric lymphoma are based on their histological grade and stage of the disease. They include surgical resection and/or radiotherapy for local tumor control as well as chemotherapy in the case of disseminated disease or high malignancy. Currently, special interest focuses on the effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication."
CD009944,0,8001485,0,Endosonographically guided fine-needle aspiration puncture of paraesophagogastric mass lesions: preliminary results.,"Mass lesions adjacent to the gastroesophageal wall can be visualized in detail by endoscopic ultrasonography. However, in many patients tissue diagnosis of these mass lesions is urgently required. We evaluated the efficiency of transmural fine-needle aspiration puncture guided by endosonography for cytological confirmation of such mass lesions. Endosonographically guided transmural fine-needle aspiration (EUS-guided FNA) puncture was performed in 12 patients with extrinsic mass lesions adjacent to the gastro-esophageal wall. In seven patients a malignant tumor and in four patients a benign lesion, were identified by EUS-guided FNA puncture, while in one patient no diagnostic tissue specimen could be obtained. No complications were observed. The cytological result of a malignant lesion was confirmed in six patients either by autopsy (n = 3), resection of tumor metastasis (n = 1) or by demonstration of a local recurrence of a previously histopathologically diagnosed carcinoma (n = 2), while the benign cytological results in four patients were confirmed by a follow-up period of at least 13 months (n = 3) and appropriate diagnostic tests (n = 1). It is concluded that EUS-guided FNA puncture is an efficient diagnostic technique for the assessment of malignancy and tissue diagnosis of extrinsic paragastroesophageal mass lesions. An important precondition for the successful performance of transmural EUS-guided FNA puncture is the application of endosonographic transducers with longitudinal scanning in the axis of the endoscope."

From 1990 to 1992, 33 endoscopic ultrasound investigations have been performed in 25 patients with malignant lymphomas at the Cologne University Hospital. In addition, 21 of these patients had other (conventional) diagnostic procedures at the same time serving as reference. Endoscopic ultrasound showed lymphomas in 16/21 patients, and no evidence of lymphomas in 5/21 patients. The referencial investigations together showed lymphomas in 17/21 patients, and no evidence of lymphomas in 4/21 patients. Therefore, sensitivity was 94%. 5 of the patients in addition had involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract's wall, proven by referencial investigations, which was diagnosed correctly in all cases. The pathological lymph nodes appeared mostly as echopoor, rather sharply demarcated and homogeneous. Their size was 7 mm to 55 mm in diameter, median 11 mm. The different histological types of lymphomas could not be distinguished by means of these criteria. Endoscopic ultrasound allows a detailed view at the mediastinal and epigastrical lymph node stations and may give important informations for the staging of malignant lymphomas."
CD009944,0,7975766,0,[Primary stomach lymphoma. An assessment of the current status].,"The gastrointestinal tract represents the most frequent extranodal manifestation of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma which are classified according to the concept of MALT (mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue) have to be differentiated from lymphoma involving secondarily the digestive tract. Primary gastric lymphoma which appear at an advanced age can be usually diagnosed endoscopic-bioptically. Representing the major prognostic factors options in the therapy of gastric lymphoma are based on the histologic grading and the stage of disease. Surgical resection and radiotherapy allow a good local tumor control while chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in case of disseminated disease or high malignancy. Characterizing the morphology and molecular biology of primary gastric lymphoma of the MALT, evaluating the role of endoscopic ultrasound in the local staging (EI1, EI2 and EII1), and optimating the therapeutic modalities are main topics of an ongoing prospective multicenter trial."
CD009944,0,7973591,0,[Endoscopic ultrasound in detection of locoregional lymph node metastases of gastrointestinal tumors].,"The locoregional lymph node status was assessed via EUS and CT in 118 patients (37 female, 81 male, average age 63.1 [37-87] years) who had histologically confirmed neoplasias in the upper GI tract. These investigations were made as part of preoperative tumour staging. Resections were performed subsequently, yielding regional lymph node metastases in 76 cases and in 23 patients only enlarged lymph nodes with benign histological findings. Overall accuracy of findings of regional lymph node metastases was 84% for oesophageal carcinomas with EUS and 57% with CT, 78% for gastric carcinomas with EUS and 46% with CT and 68% for pancreatic and ampullary carcinomas with EUS and 53% with CT. In 2 non-Hodgkin lymphomas of the stomach, paragastral malignant lymphomas were identified via EUS but not via CT. In two further cases both methods yielded false positive results. Locoregionally enlarged lymph nodes with exclusively benign histology were found in 22 of 23 cases via EUS but were misinterpreted as metastases in 15 cases. Hence, EUS is evidently superior to CT in identifying locoregional lymph node metastases. The accuracy, however, does not represent tumour status assessment made possible with the help of endosonographic criteria; rather, it is essentially due to the high degree of sensitivity of the method and the scarcity of completely benign enlargements of lymph nodes in the vicinity of neoplasias."

At the present time the following conclusions can be drawn: Submucous tumors can be clearly demonstrated and unequivocally distinguished from extramural compressions. Although the EUS aspect does not allow to differentiate benign from malignant lesions, EUS findings can give hints as to the nature of a submucous tumor (leiomyoma, lipoma, cyst). The main indication for EUS ist local tumor staging. The pT stage of esophageal carcinoma can be assessed correctly in 84% (73 to 92%) and that of gastric carcinoma in 80% (69 to 92%) of the cases by EUS. Especially in early tumor stages, EUS is superior to computed tomography. Regional lymph node metastases can be visualized in 70 to 90% of the cases. EUS is also helpful in the follow-up of patients with operative resection of esophageal cancer and in patients with gastric non-Hodgkin lymphoma during radio-/chemotherapy."

Between October 1991 and July 1993, preoperative staging with endoscopic ultrasound was performed in 45 patients with rectal carcinoma. Twenty-four received preoperative radiation therapy. For carcinoma of the middle and the lower part of rectum, the distance between the inferior pole of the tumour and the levator ani muscle was systematically measured. The ultrasound results were compared with histological and surgical findings. The staging was accurately predicted in 82.2% of cases. The depth of cancer invasion was correct in 93.3% (95.2% when preoperative radiation therapy was not applied and 79.1% after radiation therapy). Presence or absence of lymph nodes metastasis was correctly determined in 84.4% (90.5% when preoperative radiation therapy was not applied and 79.1% after radiation therapy). The distance between the inferior pole of the tumour and the levator ani muscle was correctly determined in 29/31 carcinoma of the middle and the lower part of rectum.

The aim of this article is to analyze the Japanese method for early gastric cancer detection and staging, by sketch of certain morphologic criterions and a report of a typical case. In our case the lesion's staging was predicted as submucosal by means of endoscopy and double contrast roentgenography. Endoscopic ultrasonography complemented the analysis.

The main indication was locoregional staging of esophageal and cardia carcinomas, or restaging after radiotherapy or combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 37% of the patients (10 of 27) an EUS T4 carcinoma was diagnosed, and in 63% (17/27) an EUS-T3 one. Regional lymph-node metastases were diagnosed in 96% of the cases. EUS restaging after nonsurgical palliative treatment detected tumor lesions in three of eight patients. Despite the fact that the imaging quality is still not satisfactory, our results suggest that the limitations of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) examination due to stenosing tumor growth can be overcome by the use of this ultrasonic esophagoprobe or similar instruments. Further technical developments may improve the resolution as well as the imaging quality in the celiac axis region."

The validity of endosonographic criteria of lymph node dignity (size, echogenicity, internal echo pattern and margin structure) was assessed using computer-supported B-mode analysis and compared to histopathological results. Of 26 lymph nodes with a diameter of more than 10 mm, 19 were metastatic (72%). The subjective assessment of the internal echo pattern (homogeneity) and the node margins by an experienced observer allowed the diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes, but there was a high proportion of false positives (52%).

Data from 63 patients with esophageal cancer and 147 patients with gastric cancer who underwent surgery were available for comparison of the endosonographic TNM classification to the histophathological findings of the resected specimens. The overall accuracy of EUS in the assessment of tumor infiltration depth was 85.7% and 78% in esophageal and gastric cancer, respectively. The sensitivity of EUS in the detection of regional lymph node metastases was 90% in esophageal and 87% in gastric carcinoma.

CD009944,0,8508381,0,New staging techniques. Endoscopic ultrasound.,"Rectal ultrasonography allows detailed images of rectal tumors and provides the most accurate method of staging rectal cancer. Ultrasound assessment of the extent of tumor invasion and lymph node involvement is superior to computed tomography (CT) scan, though CT is still the best method to assess liver involvement. Ultrasound assessment of cancers above the peritoneal reflection is less useful clinically because it currently does not alter management. Outcome studies have not been reported using ultrasound to stage rectal cancer but should be forthcoming. Inflammation present at the leading edge of the tumor is the greatest cause for overstaging, and difficulty in determining tumor involvement into, but not through, the muscularis propria is another important cause of inaccurate staging. Lymph node assessment can be problematic, but future developments in ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology holds promise for more accurate assessment of lymph node status. Surgery will remain the standard method to treat rectal cancer, but new methods, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound, may provide new ways to treat some patients."

At the present time the following conclusions can be drawn: Intramural tumors can be clearly visualized and differentiated from extragastric conditions by EUS. Pancreatic tumors smaller than 2 cm can be delineated exactly by EUS and the sensitivity of EUS in demonstrating pancreatic tumors is 90%, a fact which is especially helpful in the early diagnosis of endocrine tumors. Since the endosonographic aspect does not allow us to separate unequivocally benign from malignant alterations, a clear distinction between inflammatory (pseudo) tumors and neoplastic pancreatic lesions based on EUS findings alone is not possible. The main indication for EUS is in regional TN-staging. The pT-stage of esophageal cancers can be determined correctly in 84% (73-92), of gastric carcinomas in 80% (69-92), of pancreatic cancers in 90% (88-92) and of the distal common bile duct and of papilla of Vater in 85% (83-89) of cases. EUS is superior to computed tomography, especially in early tumor stages. The correct EUS-staging of proximal bile duct tumors and of gallbladder cancer is far more difficult, especially when the latter is filled with stones. Local lymph node metastases are visualized by EUS in about 70-90% of cases. EUS is also valuable in evaluation of the anastomosis after operative resection of esophageal or gastric carcinoma, as well as in the follow-up of patients with gastric non-Hodgkin lymphomas during radiochemotherapy."

Although EUS was accurate in determining the absence of lymph node metastases (accuracy in stage N0: 93%), it was not reliable in determining stages N1 and N2 (64% and 52%, respectively). Since 88% of all T3 and T4 tumors had lymph node metastases, the concomitant T stage may be an important criterion for assessing the nature of endosonographically visualized lymph nodes.

Sixty-four patients suspected of pancreatic cancer were studied prospectively, and the results of imaging techniques were compared to histology and surgical exploration. There were 49 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 11 of pancreatitis, 2 of common bile duct carcinoma, 1 lymphoma and 1 hepatocellular carcinoma with peripancreatic metastatic lymph nodes. EUS was significantly more accurate (91%) than CT (66%) and US (64%) for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. EUS was able to image all 7 cancers less than 25 mm in diameter, US and CT only one. There were 4 false positives with EUS which were all cases of pseudotumorous pancreatitis. For detecting lymph node involvement, EUS was significantly more sensitive (62%) and accurate (74%) than US (8% and 37%) and CT (19% and 42%), respectively. Invaded lymph nodes adjacent to large tumors and micrometastatic involvement were responsible for this lack of sensitivity. EUS was significantly more sensitive (100%) than CT (71%) and US (17%) for detecting venous involvement. The specificity of EUS was lower (67%) because of duodenal bulb stenosis and large tumors. In conclusion, this prospective and comparative study confirms that EUS is an accurate tool for diagnosis and locoregional spread assessment of pancreatic cancer when performed in a reference center. EUS is of particular interest for small tumours. However, EUS does not enable differentiation of pseudotumorous pancreatitis from adenocarcinoma."

Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was used to assess the horizontal extent of cancerous invasion below the mucosal layer. In 105 patients (110 lesions) with gastric carcinoma, ultrasonographic images of resected specimens were compared with histological findings. The horizontal extent of the hypoechoic region of in vitro ultrasound was compared with the horizontal extent of the cancerous invasion and fibrosis in histological sections. In cases showing echo patterns characteristic of peptic ulcerations within the tumor focus, the horizontal spread of the echo-poor region correlated well with the spread of fibrosis, but not with the cancerous lesion. In other cases with no ulceration, the horizontal spread of the echo-poor region corresponded well with the cancerous lesions. To evaluate oral invasion of the cancerous lesion below the mucosa, 16 patients with gastric carcinoma who had clips placed during endoscopy were subsequently examined by EUS. The use of EUS combined with the clips allowed for a more accurate diagnosis of the invasion, not only in the mucosa, but also into the submucosa and beyond. This combined diagnostic method was safe and useful for determining a suitable surgical resection line."

These results were compared to those in 23 patients with gastric NHL operated on prior to the introduction of EUS in the hospital who were comparable with respect to tumor location and extent. In comparison with the ten cases where treatment was guided by EUS, the rate of total gastrectomy was higher (65% versus 10%) and the R0 resection rate lower (72% versus 100%) in this group of 23 patients. These results show that EUS may play a crucial role in the pre-surgical staging of gastric NHL."
CD009944,0,8287809,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography in the local staging of primary gastric lymphoma.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and endoscopy were prospectively performed and compared to the histopathologic findings of the resection specimens in 24 patients with primary gastric lymphoma (PGL). On EUS, three types of PGL could be differentiated, a superficial type (n = 10), an infiltrating type (n = 12) and a tumorous type (n = 2). In the correct assessment of surface extension of the tumors, endoscopy and EUS agreed in 37.5% of cases and EUS showed more extensive disease than endoscopy in 58% of cases. However, in comparison to the resection specimens, EUS still underestimated the tumor surface extension in 37.5% of cases; this was mainly in low grade malignant PGL. The depth of tumor infiltration was correctly determined on EUS compared to the resection specimens in 91.5% of cases. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of diagnosing lymph node metastases were 100%, 80% and 83%, respectively. We conclude that EUS is a useful pre-therapeutic staging tool for primary gastric lymphoma but there remain some problems in determining the longitudinal and circular tumor spread in order to accurately guide the extent of gastric resection."

In benign tumors, echoendoscopy may be used to decrease the risk of hemorrhage or perforation before resection of large polyps or submucosal lesions. The most important indications for echoendoscopy, however, are in the field of GI oncology, and the method may lead to a better selection of superficial cancers without lymph node metastases. However, endoscopic ultrasound is still limited in differentiating mucosal from submucosal tumors and in the detection and interpretation of small lymph nodes. Technical improvements and careful interpretation of echoendoscopy will increase the number of patients cured by non-surgical procedures in the future."

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a new method, enabling EUS (curved array transducer)--guided fine needle aspiration of deep lesions. From October 1991 to August 1992, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration was performed in 26 patients in whom a mediastinal mass (6 cases), mediastinal lymph nodes (4 cases), submucosal tumor (5 cases), extrinsic masses (4 cases) and large fold gastric disease with negative endoscopic biopsy (7 cases) was detected by EUS. Diagnostic results were obtained in 19 of 26 patients (73.1%). A malignant tumor was detected in 21 of 26 patients. The EUS-guided fine needle aspiration was positive in 16 cases. The sensitivity for diagnosis of malignancy was 76.2% while specificity was 100%. The development of this new technique in the future needs further study."
CD009944,0,1732981,1,Regional lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer: evaluation with endoscopic US.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed in 83 patients with gastric cancer to evaluate regional lymph node metastasis. Histopathologic findings were compared with preoperative EUS findings in a total of 1,519 resected lymph nodes. In lymph node staging, the prevalence of metastatic adenopathy was 31.3% (26 of 83 patients); EUS had an accuracy of 83.1% (69 of 83 patients), sensitivity of 53.8% (14 of 26 patients), specificity of 96.5% (55 of 57 patients), positive predictive value of 87.5% (14 of 16 patients), and negative predictive value of 82.1% (55 of 67 patients). The greater the maximum diameter of the node with metastasis, or the larger the ratio of the metastatic area to the cross-sectional area of the node, the higher the detection rate. In tumors classified on the basis of depth of invasion according to the 1987 TNM system, the rate of detection of metastasis in individual nodes was 0% in pT1 tumors (none of five nodes), 20% in pT2 tumors (17 of 85 nodes), 29% in pT3 tumors (20 of 70 nodes), and 10% in pT4 tumors (three of 31 nodes).

CD009944,0,1641613,0,[Reoperation in colorectal carcinoma with curative intention].,"From the surgical point of view it may be helpful to adopt the following guidelines in the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally recurrent colorectal cancer: 1. A gastroenterologist concerned with oncological patients should initiate adequate resectional treatment of the primary tumor. 2. In case of locoregional recurrences, every diagnostic effort (endoscopy, intraluminal ultrasound, angiogram, CT-scan, MRI) should be made to select patients with limited and resectable disease. 3. In patients with liver metastases amenable to surgical resection it is mandatory to rule out extrahepatic disease preoperatively as far as possible. 4. Prognostic factors deriving from tumor-biological data, extent of recurrent disease, and laboratory findings (CEA) must be taken into consideration when the decision whether to operate is to be made. These arguments should also be used to support non-operative treatment in patients with a type of recurrence that cannot be cured by surgery. 5. Postoperatively, all information (intraoperatively detected extrahepatic disease, tumor infiltrated resection margins, CEA not returning to normal levels) should be combined to classify patients according to whether they carry a high risk for a second tumor recurrence and should thus undergo additional treatment. In a ""low-risk situation"", further follow-up seems to be adequate."
CD009944,0,1633775,0,Application of ultrasonic probes prior to endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer.,"The development of a new strip biopsy technique for endoscopic mucosectomy utilizing endoscopic saline injection and a double-channel endoscope permits the safe and simple resection of superficial type early gastric cancer which has been difficult to perform with conventional polypectomy techniques. Preresection assessment of the depth of invasion and postresection assessment of efficacy are important with regard to treatment of early gastric cancer, but conventional endoscopic ultrasonography employed for this purpose requires special equipment and involves intricate procedures. An ultrasonic probe which can be used endoscopically has recently been developed and is currently in the trial stage. The authors have conducted studies with respect to a 7.5 MHz radial scanning type Miniature Ultrasonic Probe as well as a 20 MHz manual linear scanning type Sonoprobe System. Experimental studies indicated that the former type is capable of delineating postresection ulcers, while the latter permitted delineation of tumors as hypoechoic images in 9 of 11 cases of early gastric cancer."

The great strength of EUS in staging these cancers is its ability to image the gut wall and adjacent structures in unique detail. EUS is more accurate than computed tomography in staging the depth of primary tumor invasion (T) and regional lymph node metastases (N). High frequency EUS is not useful in staging for distant metastases (M) due to limited depth of the field. EUS also has limitations in reliably distinguishing between neoplastic and inflammatory tissue. Thus, the major use of EUS is in staging rather than in diagnosis. However, initial reports indicate that EUS may be helpful in the detection of malignancy in Barrett's esophagus, in diagnosing post-operative recurrent cancer, and in evaluating the response to non-operative therapy. EUS appears to represent an important advance in the staging and follow-up of patients with esophageal and gastric cancer. Instruments and techniques will continue to evolve, but the next level of research should be designed to show that the improved staging provided by EUS has clinical utility and can affect patient outcome."

The findings were made prospectively and independently of each other. EUS proved to be superior to transabdominal US and to CT in the diagnosis of tumour infiltration of the portal and splenic veins. For the portal vein the sensitivity was 93% by EUS, 14% by US and 36% by CT. Corresponding figures for the splenic vein were 92%, 39% and 69%. EUS was markedly superior to angiography in the diagnosis of portal vein involvement (sensitivity of 93% and 36%, respectively), but the two methods had similar sensitivity regarding splenic vein infiltration (92 and 100%). Tumour involvement of the coeliac trunk was diagnosed with higher sensitivity angiographically (86%) than by EUS (57%), CT (71%) or US (29%). Regarding T and N staging, EUS was superior to both US and CT. These data indicate that EUS is the most accurate method for local tumour staging of potentially resectable pancreatic carcinoma. It can replace angiography in the diagnosis of portal vein infiltration."

EUS was shown to be highly accurate in the local staging of gastrointestinal tumors (T and N stage). The clinical relevance of endosonography derives from stage-dependent treatment protocols selecting patients for different forms of tumor therapy. The second advantage of endosonography is a high-resolution imaging of the pancreas enabling the detection of small lesions (e.g. endocrine tumors). Endoscopic ultrasonography is furthermore the most reliable method for local staging of pancreatic and ampullary carcinoma. The role of endosonography in benign gastroenterological disorders is less well established. With the increasing use of laparoscopic surgery endosonography may become even more important in the future.

CD009944,0,1479865,0,[Endosonography of stomach tumors].,"Based on own experience and on the published literature we report about indications and efficiency of endosonography (EUS) in gastric tumors. The following conclusions can be drawn at the present time. Submucous tumors can be clearly differentiated from extragastric compressions. Although the endosonographic aspect does not allow to formulate an etiologic diagnosis, EUS findings can give hints regarding the nature of the submucous tumor (e.g. leiomyoma, lipoma, cyst). In 75% of cases malignant submucous tumors can be visualized and a correct preoperative staging can be performed. EUS is of special importance in the description of gastric carcinoma. The pT stage can be correctly determined preoperatively in about 80% (69-92%) of cases. Accompanying inflammation in early gastric cancer can lead to overstaging. The sensitivity for local lymph node metastases reaches about 77% (50-88%). Gastric non-Hodgkin lymphomas can be excellently visualized with EUS. The sensitivity amounts to 90-100% and in about 90% of cases the extent of the tumor can be correctly determined preoperatively. The response to radio-chemotherapy of gastric non-Hodgkin lymphomas can be monitored easily with the method. At the present time EUS is the most sensitive imaging tool in visualizing and staging of gastric tumors. Its main advantage is the exact demonstration of intramural and paragastric alterations. However, despite the use of high ultrasonic frequencies and the excellent demonstration of even tiny details with EUS, biopsies for histologic evaluation are still mandatory, especially when dealing with gastric ulcer."

Endoscopic ultrasonography may provide accurate detection and staging of gastric cancer because of its ability to visualize both the intramural and extramural extent of the lesion and any adjacent lymph node involvement. From february 90 to april 91, 29 patients with a gastric carcinoma were studied endosonographically before surgery. All studies were performed with an Olympus EU-M3. Preoperative TNM classification and a prediction of the resectability of gastric cancer were done in every patient. The results were matched with those obtained with the histology of resected specimens according to the TNM classification 1987. Endoscopic ultrasonography was accurate in assessing the extent and depth of tumor infiltration. The overall accuracy rate was 90.5% (19 out of 21 patients). Overstaging occurred in 9.5% of the cases (2 patients); none understaging occurred. EUS was less accurate in assessment of lymph node metastasis; the overall accuracy rate was 57.1%. Distinction between reactive lymph node and small micrometastatic lymph node involvement could be hard. Local resectability was correctly diagnosed with EUS in each of 23 patients; in two patients an intramural mass with a deep infiltration into the surrounding tissue was correctly diagnosed. In our opinion EUS is an essential diagnostic procedure in the clinical staging of the gastric cancer."

Results were compared with histological findings in resected specimens. Accuracy in staging gastric cancer using the T grade of the 1987 TNM system was 81.1% (60 of 74 patients). Endoscopic ultrasound provided excellent results compared with computed tomography and conventional ultrasound, particularly in evaluating perigastric lymph node metastasis and direct infiltration to the adjacent organs. The success rate in detecting lymph node metastasis was 50% (11 of 22 patients); the accuracy in diagnosing direct infiltration to the adjacent organs was 60% (three of five patients).

In the present case, that of a 60-yr-old woman, the work-up of radiography and conventional endoscopy revealed an ulcerating cancer of the stomach. Subsequent EUS showed a solid high-echoic mass occupying the third (submucosal) and fourth (muscularis propria) layers of gastric wall, suggestive of an advanced cancer invading the muscularis propria. However, histologic examination of the surgical specimen showed that this tumor was early submucosal carcinoma confined to the surface of a pancreatic rest. Retrospective evaluation of EUS pictures proved that the mass had tubular or circular echoless structures associated with thickening of the fourth layer, suggesting the pancreatic rest. Our experience in reviewing EUS findings of this tumor seems noteworthy, inasmuch as EUS indicates that EUS may provide certain characteristic features of gastric pancreatic rest that should be differentiated from invading carcinoma."
CD009944,0,1991632,0,Evaluation of endosonography in TN staging of oesophageal cancer.,"Strategies for the treatment of cancer of the oesophagus depend on the tumour stage at the time of diagnosis. Resection, the only curative treatment, is confined to early tumour stages. Tumours with local infiltration are usually unresectable and require palliative treatment. Computed tomography has been widely used for preoperative staging but often fails to define this correctly. Endoscopic ultrasound allows direct visualisation of the parietal wall and may be useful in staging gastrointestinal tumours. In a comparative prospective study, 52 patients with tumours of the oesophagus were investigated preoperatively both by endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography to determine the stage of tumour infiltration and local lymph node involvement. Thirty seven of these patients underwent operation, resection, or dissection and entered the study. The intraoperative findings or the histopathological assessment, or both, were taken as a reference. For all TN stages of oesophageal tumours, correct preoperative staging was accomplished by endoscopic ultrasound in 89% for T stage and 69% for N stage compared with 51% and 51% respectively by computed tomography (highly significant using Fisher's exact test). This study shows that endoscopic ultrasound is useful in preoperative TN staging of tumours of the oesophagus."
CD009944,0,1991278,0,Primary neoplasms of the hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Staging and follow-up.,"The number of imaging modalities available to stage and follow-up patients with primary neoplasms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract continues to increase. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography are useful techniques for both staging and follow-up. For staging, CT is most frequently used for the detection of liver metastases and is increasingly used as a substitute for the chest radiograph in the detection of lung metastases. CT is still the imaging test of choice for the preoperative staging of esophageal carcinoma. CT is less helpful in staging the patient with gastric carcinoma or colorectal carcinoma. The current usefulness of MRI in the staging of GI tract malignancies is limited by the lack of an adequate oral intraluminal contrast agent and degradation of images due to motion. Sonography, especially the new technique of endoscopic ultrasound, is promising for the detection of local invasion from GI tract malignancies. CT is used in the follow-up of patients with tumors of the GI tract to detect liver, adrenal, and nodal metastases as well as local recurrence because of the ability of CT to detect extraluminal masses. CT of the pelvis has been recommended as a routine follow-up procedure in patients who have undergone abdominal-peroneal resection. Both CT and MRI can be used to detect local recurrence, but suffer from the inability to differentiate scar from recurrent tumor. The initial hope that MRI would be capable of differentiating postoperative scar tissue from recurrent tumor has not been realized. Therefore, with positive CT or MRI findings, occasionally a percutaneous biopsy will be required to confirm local recurrence."

The results were correlated with the histology of resected specimens. EUS was accurate in assessing the depth of tumor infiltration. Over all accuracy of EUS for cardiac cancer was 90%. Recognition of ultrasonographic patterns had enabled us to judge the mode of tumor infiltration whether expansive or infiltrative. Microscopical spread over 5 mm to the esophagus of the cardiac cancer could be detected by EUS.

The normal gastric wall has a five-layer structure on EUS. In 19 lesions, changes on EUS were limited to the first and/or second layers, suggesting that invasion was limited within the mucosa. In 91 lesions, changes were evident in the third or deeper layers. Alterations in the EUS appearance could be divided into two types: type A, with destruction of the layered structure and type B with thickening of the layers. The amount of interstitial tissue in cancer was classified as medullary or intermediate in 90% of type A, and as scirrhous in 82% of type B tumor. The EUS diagnosis of invasion was 95% accurate for stage M cancers, 75% for SM, 64% for PM, 100% for SS, 79% for SE, and 100% for SI lesions. The overall accuracy was 81%.

CD009944,0,1860438,1,Analysis of gastric carcinoma growth by endoscopic ultrasonography.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed preoperatively in 82 patients with gastric carcinoma (40 with early and 42 advanced malignancy). Measurements of wall thickness were performed in each case and showed good correlation with histological findings. Wall thickening was found to consist of both tumorous and accompanying ulcerous tissue. Thus, increasing wall thickness, as demonstrated by EUS, may not necessarily mean progressive tumor growth. The EUS features of gastric carcinoma were analyzed and four distinct growth patterns found: predominantly intramural (IM) or intraluminal (IL) growth with preservation (Type 1) or destruction (Type 2) of the submucosal echo-rich layer. All early carcinomas displayed the IL-type growth pattern on EUS (98% IL1-type) and 81% of advanced tumors showed IM-type features. EUS was able to differentiate between early and advanced carcinoma in 98% of cases. The EUS pattern of submucosal destruction (type IM2 or IL2) corresponded to the expanding type tumor according to Ming's histopathological classification. On the other hand, 24 of 26 infiltrative tumors according to Ming were found on EUS to have an intramural growth pattern with preservation of the submucosa (type IM1). It is concluded that EUS is highly sensitive in predicting the tumor growth pattern in gastric carcinoma, providing important additional information to the currently used TNM staging system. Measurements of wall thickness are reliable but differentiation between tumorous growth and peritumorous changes is not possible."
CD009944,0,1854986,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography of the upper gastrointestinal tract.,"EUS unites two established imaging techniques and extends the range of observation into and beyond the wall of the GI tract. The close proximity of the sonographic probe to the region of interest combined with high ultrasonic frequencies of between 7.5 and 12 MHz yields images of high resolution. EUS is used in the staging of benign and malignant neoplastic disorders of the oesophagus, stomach, pancreas and extrahepatic bile ducts. It helps to establish operability, to plan surgical approach, to follow response to therapy and to search for recurrence. The predictive value in defining the T and N stages of oesophageal carcinoma lies between 80 and 90% and 65 and 85%, respectively. It is clearly superior to CT in tumour stages T1 and T2. In gastric cancer, resectability based on the TNM staging system can be correctly assessed by EUS in 85% of cases and EUS detection and staging of early gastric cancer reaches an accuracy of 90%. The EUS accuracy rate for resectability of pancreatic carcinoma is 83% and tumour infiltration into the portal and splenic vein can be correctly determined by EUS in 94% and 67%, respectively. A reliable EUS differentiation between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma based on the echo pattern and outer margins is not possible. The development of EUS-guided needle biopsy should improve the specificity of EUS in this regard. Experience to data suggests as well that EUS will assume an important place in the staging of bile duct tumours. EUS has expanded our endoscopic and sonographic capabilities and it is to be hoped that further technical improvement, e.g. the construction of forward-viewing endoscopes combined with radial scanning devices, will contribute to a widespread use of this technique by gastroenterologists."

In order to discuss the effectiveness of each body imagings, the preoperative staging of pancreatic cancer was evaluated in direct invasion to the anterior pancreatic capsule and stomach (S), direct invasion to the duodenum (D), direct invasion to the retroperitoneal adjacent vessels (Rp), and regional lymph node metastasis (N). The overall accuracy rate was 77% with EUS (50% with US, 38% with CT, 56% with Angio) in S, 81% with EUS (44% with US, 38% with CT, 63% with Angio) in D, 77% with EUS (58% with US, 42% with CT, 73% with Angio) in Rp, and 65% with EUS (58% with US, 38% with CT) in N. EUS revealed high accuracy rates because EUS images of the whole pancreas, surrounding organs and major vessels were clearly visualized through the gastroduodenal walls. Also, the accuracy rates of Angio in Rp and US in N were almost the same as those of EUS in Rp and N. However, it was difficult for every procedure to diagnose the retroperitoneal perineural invasion. From these results, EUS is one of the most beneficial procedures for detecting of the extent of cancer. EUS is expected to be popularized in the diagnosis and staging of the pancreatic cancer."

Symptoms are non-specific. At endoscopy three main patterns can be recognized: ulceration, diffuse infiltration, or a polypoid mass. Endoscopic biopsy results may be false-negative (up to 8%) owing to submucosal localization. The new technique of endoscopic ultrasonography is accurate in measuring depth of infiltration and regional lymph nodes. Preoperative diagnosis altered the indication for surgery. Without resection an excellent local tumour control (stage I, 85%, and stage II, 69%) can be achieved, leading to a fair prognosis: 5-year relapse free survival in stage I, 83%, and in stage II, 58%. Intra-abdominal recurrences were scarce (2%), and severe complications such as perforation and life-threatening haemorrhage were seldom present (4%). Thus, resection is not necessary, but early recognition is highly significant. Favourable results can be achieved by irradiation or chemotherapy with irradiation."

After visualization by EUS the guillotine needle biopsy was performed in 21 patients with submucosal tumors of the stomach. There were 2 failures in 2 patients with leiomyomas. The diagnosis suggested by EUS was confirmed by guillotine biopsy in 17 cases. Guillotine biopsy detected 2 cases of unsuspected leiomyosarcoma which were confirmed surgically.

To date, fiberoptic endoscopy has yet to change this seemingly inexorable fact. Nevertheless, endoscopy plays a vital role in the evaluation and diagnosis of the gastric cancer patient and provides palliative options to patients suffering from advanced disease that may not respond to other modalities. With the advent of endoscopic screening protocols identifying cases at an early stage, there is early epidemiologic evidence of impact on the mortal consequences of this disease in high incidence areas such as Japan. Endoscopic ultrasound, flow cytometry of endoscopic biopsies, and photodynamic techniques offer the prospect of increasing definition of gastric malignancy prior to therapy, and new endoscopic therapies await further study to define their potential role in treating early cancer non-operatively. Twenty years ago, scientists intent on the study of gastric neoplasia played a major role in the advent of fiberoptic endoscopy. To date, their reward has been a wealth of information. As this material is digested and applied, it seems reasonable to believe their efforts may be eventually rewarded by a reduction in the epidemiologic impact of this disease, brought about not by changing global incidence patterns, but by knowledge and technology derived and administered endoscopically."

As far as the gastrointestinal tract is concerned, endoscopically controlled ultrasonic probes provide visualization of the various layers of the intestinal wall. It is therefore possible to describe lesions of the esophagus, stomach, and the rectum with regard to their nature and depth of infiltration. Furthermore, periesophageal and perigastric organs can be visualized. It has become evident that endosonography is particularly important for pretherapeutic staging of tumors of the esophagus, stomach, and rectum.

Ultrasonographic findings were compared with the histopathological findings of resected specimens. The tumor which invaded the submucosa or deeper layers was visualized as low echogenicity region in the third layer (corresponding to the submucosa) or deeper layers. The horizontal spread of the low echogenicity region represented that of the tumor or the associated fibrosis, but not the tumor itself. In the cases showing echo patterns which were characteristic of the peptic ulceration in the tumor focus (Type II-1, II-2, UL), the horizontal spread of cancer invasion in the submucosal layer or deeper layers (L Ca) was smaller than that of low echogenicity region depicted by ultrasonography (L U).

There were 18 staging exams of known neoplasms, and 24 examinations to evaluate possible mass. Forty-three examinations were successful, four failed due to instrument malfunction, and three were technical failures. Among 35 exams for masses, follow-up pathology was available in 21 and confirmed EUS findings in 90%. EUS yielded additional information, not available by other imaging studies, in 60% of successful exams. No complications were seen. The recent literature is reviewed in approximately 2000 patients.

Endoscopic ultrasonography was always performed after axial-vision fiberscopy anal routine biopsy specimens were obtained. Computed tomography was also done in all cases of extrinsic compression. Distinction between subepithelial tumor and extrinsic compression was made in all patients by endoscopic ultrasonography and in 5 cases by fiberscopic examination with biopsy specimens. Localization and intramural spread of subepithelial tumors were correctly determined in 12 of 13 cases by endoscopic ultrasonography (diagnostic accuracy: 92 percent). The echoendoscopic semiology of 21 subepithelial tumors was retrospectively established. The histologic nature of some of these tumors can be suggested by these signs. Endoscopic ultrasonography is superior to computed tomography in the evaluation of esogastric extrinsic compressions, particularly in the diagnosis of posterior mediastinal carcinomatosis and of tumoral invasion of the deep parietal layers. We conclude that endoscopic ultrasonography is currently the best procedure in the assessment of subepithelial tumors and extrinsic compressions of the esophagus and the stomach."

SMG could diagnose the invasion correctly in 97% of m (mucosa) cancers, 88% of sm (submucosa) cancers and 100% of advanced cancers. On the other hand, linear-type EUS could diagnose the cancer invasion correctly in 60% of the m cancers, 83% of the sm cancers and 100% of advanced cancers. The results of the comparison of radial-type EUS and SMG showed similar results. Both EUS and SMG are appropriate for the judgement of endoscopic treatments. However, for the selection of the indication of endoscopic treatment which is applied to relatively small sized lesions in general, SMG appears to be superior to EUS in both resolution power and accuracy in shooting."

Cases showing ultrasonographic changes extending deeper than the actual tumor were found to have fibrosis associated with peptic ulceration within the tumor focus. In such cases the echo images chiefly depicted the form and nature of the fibrosis, and the images were so characteristic that they could be classified into patterns.

By EUS, gastrointestinal aberrant pancreases were delineated as hypoechoic masses with blurred boundary containing fine scattered hyperechoic spots, and also there were thickening of the fourth layer below the mass. Occasionally, there were some duct-like structures within the mass or marginal lobular structures. Moreover, the ultrasonographic patterns of aberrant pancreases were classified into 2 types, that is, M and S types. On histological examination, M type cases, in which the mass attached to the thickened fourth layer by EUS, were corresponded to acinar type and the pancreatic acinar cells penetrated into the proper muscle layer of the gastrointestinal wall, whereas S type cases, in which the mass was separated from the fourth layer, to ductal or mixed type. We conclude, therefore, that not only making the accurate diagnosis of aberrant pancreas but also drawing an inference of its histological type might become possible by EUS."

The results were correlated with those obtained with the histology of resected specimens according to the new (1987) TNM classification. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was accurate in assessing the extent and depth of tumor infiltration. Early gastric carcinoma could readily be distinguished from advanced carcinoma. The overall accuracy of EUS was 84.7%. Occasionally, overstaging and understaging occurred. Stenosis was a factor limiting accurate staging. EUS was reasonably accurate in the assessment of lymph node metastasis. The overall accuracy was 81.0%. In non-metastatic lymph nodes, however, the accuracy was only 50%. Difficulties occurred in distinguishing granulomatous lymph nodes and small micrometastatic lymph node involvement. EUS was not accurate in diagnosing distant metastasis, due to the limited depth of penetration of ultrasound. Technical improvements such as a reduction in the diameter of the echoprobe, and the use of the biopsy channel for EUS-guided cytological puncture will further enhance the accuracy of EUS."
CD009944,0,3291775,0,[Endoscopic sonography in cancer diagnosis].,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the method to investigate sonographically tissue architecture by intraluminal scanning using the endoscope mounted a mechanical or electronic scanning device. The method is very effective in visualizing GI tract as well as organs present in the vicinity of digestive hollow organs as high resolution sonographic images. The method can be applied also to investigate various intraperitoneal organs, especially the liver by means of sonolaparoscopy. The most obvious application of the method is the staging of malignant neoplasms of the GI tracts especially of the stomach, esophagus and rectum. EUS mostly reveals five layer structure as layers different in echogenicity and it is considerably accurate to assess extents of wall involvement in malignancy, ulceration and inflammation of the digestive tract. It is effective in differentiating between carcinoma and submucosal tumors simply by ultrasonic localizations of the tumor masses. Involvement of regional lymph-nodes can be assessed is fairly accurate thus giving precise indication in the treatment, either medical or surgical means. Agreements between EUS staging of gastric cancer and histopathological determination were considerably accurate over various stages of gastric cancer, however, the presence of concomitant ulceration sometimes caused slight over-reading on the side of EUS. Laparoscopic sonography has also proven a considerable accuracy over existing imaging methods in terms of differential diagnosis of minute liver masses. These results seem to support the view that EUS, which is only slightly invasive, has opened up new area in cancer diagnosis, especially in the diagnosis of deeply sitting neoplasms, in which other sophisticated imaging technique are not yet available."

In order to achieve absolute curability of early carcinoma, we recommend that polypectomy be performed first, whenever possible. The reason for this is that the resected polypectomised tissue enables a decision to be made as to whether further treatment is necessary, after histopathological examination of the specimen. Otherwise, cases in which snaring is impossible, such as flat or depressed carcinomas of markedly small or large size, should be treated by microwave and/or laser coagulation. In total, we have experienced 92 lesions (83 cases) of early gastric carcinoma treated by all of above 3 methods, and we currently have 5 cases showing more than 5-year survival. Among these, type II a early carcinomas less than 10mm in diameter accounted for the majority; on the other hand, there were 11 type II c cases, also with tumors less than 10mm in diameter. Referring to our surgical data, type II c (without ulcer nor lymph node metastases) less than 5mm in size is limited to the mucosa in 100% of cases, and of 6-10mm in size in 85%. We therefore propose that type II c tumors less than 10mm in size should be treated endoscopically, as well as type II a tumors of the same size. In order to determine the depth of carcinomatous invasion, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is effective. The diagnostic accuracy for Ul(-) early carcinoma is almost 100%, but for Ul(+) cases EUS is not so accurate. Further studies and improvements of EUS are thus needed."

Five ultrasonic layers of different echogenicities are displayed; each corresponds to a precise anatomic structure. In gastric diseases this layering evidently changes. In 10 patients with suspected primary gastric lymphoma, EUS showed a characteristic thickening of the second, the second and third layers, or a diffuse, transmural thickening of the entire wall. A precise correlation between the longitudinal and depth infiltration observed at EUS and the surgical finding was seen in all patients. In three cases in which the preoperative bioptic diagnosis was erroneous (two gastritis and one carcinoma) EUS showed a characteristic echographic pattern for lymphoma, which was confirmed at surgery. There was agreement also, in EUS and surgical findings in all patients, about involvement of neighbor organs.

Using EUS the digestive tract wall was seen as a 5-layered structure corresponding to the histological layers. On the basis of this layered structure of the gastric wall, the depth of cancer invasion and the results of laser treatment were evaluated. In 128 cases of gastric cancer examined by EUS and confirmed histologically, when the depth of cancer invasion was classified as mucosal, submucosal, muscularis propria, and deeper-than-subserosal invasion, the accuracy rate was 80%. In 26 cases of early gastric cancer, in the EUS images of the lesions before and after ELT, a lack of the gastric wall caused by the laser irradiation was observed. Furthermore, in the long-term follow-up study using EUS, the residual growth of the extraluminal cancer was detectable. EUS is one of the most promising methods for the evaluation of curative laser treatment of early gastric cancer."

This paper reviews imaging and endoscopy of gastric tumors in dogs and cats and the techniques used. The appearance of the normal as well as the various aspects of gastric tumors are described for these different modalities. Plain radiography is widely available but has limited diagnostic value. Contrast radiography has higher sensitivity but is laborious and time-consuming. Ultrasonography (if an adequate acoustic window is available), endosonography and endoscopy are the most appropriate modalities for diagnosing gastric tumors. They are especially useful when obtaining samples for cytologic or histopathologic examination, because the imaging modalities do not always differentiate between inflammatory or infectious conditions and neoplastic disorders. Hydro-helical CT was found helpful for evaluating the location and local invasiveness of the lesion. Ultrasonography and endoscopy are useful modalities for taking adequate biopsies."

In contrast to pancreatic cancer, ampullary cancer is often curable if detected at an early stage. The evaluation and management of ampullary cancer is similar to, but distinct from, that of other pancreaticobiliary tumors. This manuscript will review the current evaluation, diagnosis, and therapy of patients with ampullary cancer. The diagnosis of ampullary cancer is complicated by its similar clinical presentation to pancreatic cancer as well as its nonspecific laboratory findings. Diagnostic modalities such as ERCP, EUS, and biopsy are necessary for differentiating the 2 cancers, and noninvasive imaging techniques such as MRI and CT may be used for tumor staging. Although pancreaticoduodenectomy is considered the primary curative surgical option, consensus guidelines regarding adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapies are lacking."

CD009944,0,25400441,0,"Utility of PET/CT in diagnosis, staging, assessment of resectability and metabolic response of pancreatic cancer.","Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common gastrointestinal tumors, with its incidence staying at a high level in both the United States and China. However, the overall 5-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer is still extremely low. Surgery remains the only potential chance for long-term survival. Early diagnosis and precise staging are crucial to make proper clinical decision for surgery candidates. Despite advances in diagnostic technology such as computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound, diagnosis, staging and monitoring of the metabolic response remain a challenge for this devastating disease. Positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT), a relatively novel modality, combines metabolic detection with anatomic information. It has been widely used in oncology and achieves good results in breast cancer, lung cancer and lymphoma. Its utilization in pancreatic cancer has also been widely accepted. However, the value of PET/CT in pancreatic disease is still controversial. Will PET/CT change the treatment strategy for potential surgery candidates? What kind of patients benefits most from this exam? In this review, we focus on the utility of PET/CT in diagnosis, staging, and assessment of resectability of pancreatic cancer. In addition, its ability to monitor metabolic response and recurrence after treatment will be emphasis of discussion. We hope to provide answers to the questions above, which clinicians care most about."

CD009944,0,25347506,0,Can we predict complete or major response after chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer by noninvasive methods? Results of a prospective study on 61 patients.,"Rectal preservation has been proposed as an alternative to radical resection in patients with presumed complete or major response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the accuracy of digital rectal examination (DRE) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict major or complete rectal cancer response to CRT. Over 2 years, 61 patients underwent radical resection after CRT for rectal cancer. DRE and MRI were carried out before and 6 to 8 weeks after the end of CRT. Data from DRE and MRI post-CRT were compared with pathological examinations. At pathological examination, major/complete responses were recorded for tumors classified ypT1N0 and ypT0N0, respectively. DRE post-CRT showed major/complete response in 26 cases, of which 14 (54%) were confirmed by pathology. The positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values of DRE to predict major/complete response were 54 and 88 per cent, respectively. MRI post-CRT showed major/complete response in 12 cases, of which nine (75%) were confirmed by pathology. The PPV and NPV of MRI to predict major/complete response were 75 and 82 per cent, respectively. Data from DRE and RMI post-CRT were concordant in 45 patients. The PPV and NPV of concordant DRE and MRI to predict major/complete response were 82 and 91 per cent, respectively. DRE and MRI do not appear to be sufficiently accurate for safe selection of patients appropriate for a rectum-sparing strategy because the risk of leaving an invasive tumor untreated is 18 per cent."
CD009944,0,25333398,0,American Pancreatic Association Practice Guidelines in Chronic Pancreatitis: evidence-based report on diagnostic guidelines.,"The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis remains challenging in early stages of the disease. This report defines the diagnostic criteria useful in the assessment of patients with suspected and established chronic pancreatitis. All current diagnostic procedures are reviewed, and evidence-based statements are provided about their utility and limitations. Diagnostic criteria for chronic pancreatitis are classified as definitive, probable, or insufficient evidence. A diagnostic (STEP-wise; survey, tomography, endoscopy, and pancreas function testing) algorithm is proposed that proceeds from a noninvasive to a more invasive approach. This algorithm maximizes specificity (low false-positive rate) in subjects with chronic abdominal pain and equivocal imaging changes. Furthermore, a nomenclature is suggested to further characterize patients with established chronic pancreatitis based on TIGAR-O (toxic, idiopathic, genetic, autoimmune, recurrent, and obstructive) etiology, gland morphology (Cambridge criteria), and physiologic state (exocrine, endocrine function) for uniformity across future multicenter research collaborations. This guideline will serve as a baseline manuscript that will be modified as new evidence becomes available and our knowledge of chronic pancreatitis improves."
CD009944,0,25320516,0,"New approaches to gastric cancer staging: beyond endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography and positron emission tomography.","Currently, there is no single gold standard modality for staging of gastric cancer and several methods have been used complementarily in the each clinical situation. To make up for the shortcomings of conventional modalities such as endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography and (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, numerous attempts with new approaches have been made for gastric cancer staging. For T staging, magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band was evaluated to differentiate mucosal cancer from submucosal cancer. Single/double contrast-enhanced ultrasound and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were also tried to improve diagnostic accuracy of gastric cancer. For intraoperative staging with sentinel node mapping, indocyanine green infrared and fluorescence imaging was introduced. In addition, to detect micrometastasis, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction system with multiple markers was studied. Staging laparoscopy using 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic diagnosis and percutaneous diagnostic peritoneal lavage were also evaluated. However, most studies reporting new staging methods is preliminary and further studies for validation in clinical practice are needed. In this mini-review, we discuss new progress in gastric cancer staging. Especially, we focus on new diagnostic approach to gastric cancer staging beyond the conventional modalities and briefly review the remarkable clinical results of the studies published over the past three years."
CD009944,0,25320515,0,Is endoscopic ultrasonography still the modality of choice in preoperative staging of gastric cancer?,"The treatment option for gastric cancer is usually based on preoperative staging by imaging modalities. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and computed tomography (CT) have been used as the diagnostic modality of choice in preoperative staging of gastric cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been employed in several studies, and ((18)F) 2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has emerged as a new promising imaging modality. The purpose of this article is to provide summarized information on preoperative staging using EUS, multi-detector row CT (MDCT), MRI and PET for gastric cancer. In T staging, both EUS and MDCT show high accuracy. MRI seemed to have better performance, but the number of MRI studies is limited. FDG-PET is not able to properly evaluate the depth of invasion. In N staging, the diagnostic accuracy of EUS, MDCT and MRI is not sufficient. In preoperative M staging, MDCT and FDG-PET showed similar diagnostic accuracies. FDG-PET/CT fusion could be expected to show better performance in the future. Physicians should keep in mind that each diagnostic modality has advantages and limitations and choose an appropriate diagnostic strategy tailored for each patient."
CD009944,0,25310426,0,New TNM staging system for esophageal cancer: what chest radiologists need to know.,"Esophageal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and the 5-year relative survival rate remains less than 20% in the United States. The treatment of esophageal cancer should be stage specific for better clinical outcomes. Recent treatment paradigms tend to involve a multimodality approach to management, which includes surgical resection and preoperative or definitive chemoradiation therapy. Accurate pretreatment staging of esophageal cancer is integral for assessing operability and determining a suitable treatment plan. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) have published the seventh edition of the staging manual for cancer in the esophagus and esophagogastric junction. Unlike the sixth edition, the revised staging manual is data driven and harmonized with the staging of stomach cancer. Improvements include new definitions for the anatomic classifications Tis, T4, regional lymph node, N, and M and the addition of nonanatomic cancer characteristics (histopathologic cell type, histologic grade, and cancer location). Given the recent increase in the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and gastric cardia, the staging of tumors in the esophagogastric junction has been addressed. Radiologists must understand the details of the seventh edition of the AJCC-UICC staging system for esophageal cancer and use appropriate imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography/CT, for initial staging."

The stepwise implementation of new endoscopic techniques, by means of echoendoscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy, enabled us to more precisely describe the endoscopic features of GI lymphomas with substantial contribution in patient management and in tailoring the treatment strategy with organ preserving approaches. In this review, we describe the recent progresses in GI lymphoma management from disease diagnosis to follow-up with a specific focus on the endoscopic presentation according to the involved site and the lymphoma subtype. Additionally, new or emerging endoscopic technologies that have an impact on the management of gastrointestinal lymphomas are reported. We here discuss the two most common subtypes of GI lymphomas: the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and the diffuse large B cell lymphoma. A general outline on the state-of-the-art of the disease and on the role of endoscopy in both diagnosis and follow-up will be performed."

CD009944,0,25162448,0,Assessing transgastric Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery prior to clinical implementation.,"The objective was to investigate whether transgastric Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) could be implemented safely in clinical practice. The experimental studies proved ultrasonography guided access through the stomach to be feasible and safe without iatrogenic complications. Although the technique was safe, further development is needed to increase reproducibility and reduce the procedural time used for gaining access. Closing the gastrotomy after the procedure can be performed easily by application of an endoscopic clip (Over-The-Scope-Clip). Microscopic evaluation of excised gastrorrhaphies revealed that sufficient healing had been achieved after long-term follow-up. A fundamental problem with TG peritoneoscopy is the lack of NOTES specific endoscopes. With the combination of intraluminal EUS and peritoneoscopy with extraluminal EUS, it was possible to achieve sufficient visualisation of anatomical structures of interest in the diagnostics and staging of upper gastrointestinal cancers. Another problem with TG NOTES is the risk of intra-abdominal infections. Using a multimodal decontamination regimen reduced the rate of intra-abdominal pathology, but the risk of intra-abdominal abscess formation as a result of contamination from the access route was still present. To reduce this contamination, mouthwash with chlorhexidine was effective in a human randomised study. The same study also found significant higher bacterial load in the stomach of patients using proton pump inhibitor, emphasising the need to pause PPI prior to future TG interventions. Whether the risk of infectious complications after TG NOTES is comparable between animals and humans is debatable. Despite this, the subject of infectious complications and the safety profile of the TG technique require further research. Based on the evidence available in the literature and current experience, clinical implementation to the benefit of patients does not seem justifiable at present time."

Here, we present a histologically conﬁrmed case of primary GP examined with biphasic computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endosonography. A well-circumscribed extraluminal mass appearing as homogeneous attenuation/intensity with gradual enhancement was identified on biphasic enhancement CT and MRI. This mass was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map, implying that water diffusion in the mass was restricted. In addition, endosonography indicated a low echogenic mass in the gastric wall. These imaging findings increase the available knowledge about imaging of this disease and provide valuable information for differentiating primary GP from common gastric tumors."

This report presents two cases of ulcerative EGC in two males, 73- and 80-year-old, with severe fibrosis. As endoscopic ultrasonography suggested that the EGCs had invaded the submucosal layer, the endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection salvage technique was utilized for complete resection of the lesions. Although surgical gastrectomy was originally scheduled, the two patients had severe coronary heart disease, and surgeries were refused because of the risks associated with their heart conditions. The endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection salvage technique procedures described in these cases were performed under conscious sedation, and were completed within 30 min. The complete en bloc resection of EGC using endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection salvage technique was possible with a free resection margin, and no other complications were noted during the procedure. This is the first known report concerning the use of the endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection salvage technique salvage technique for treatment of ulcerative EGC. We demonstrate that endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection salvage technique it is a feasible method showing several advantages over endoscopic submucosal dissection for cases of EGC with fibrosis."

It is difficult to diagnose the tumor before surgery by only endoscopic biopsy and radiography, and there is no established method of diagnosis before surgical treatment. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on a 50-year-old Japanese woman revealed a 10 mm submucosal tumor in the anterior wall of the gastric angle. Follow-up EGD revealed an increase in the size of the tumor to 15mm. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) demonstrated a 15mm subepithelial hypoechoic solid tumor with continuity to the proper muscle layer. Histologic diagnosis by endoscopic ultrasonography guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was glomus tumor. The tumor was treated by laparoscopic local resection. The histologic diagnosis of the resected tumor was similar to the preoperative EUS-FNA results. EUS-FNA would appear to be an effective histologic test for early diagnosis of gastric glomus tumor."

The results of endoscopic biopsy can be negative for malignancy in Borrmann type IV advanced gastric cancer (AGCa) or gastric lymphoma. However, in the case of type II AGCa, repeated biopsies negative for malignancy have not been reported. A 49-year-old male patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy three times due to large gastric ulcer suspected to be Borrmann type II cancer. However, three repeat endoscopic biopsies with multiple specimens showed necrosis and superficial regenerative epithelium without malignant findings.

Here, we report on the development of a transcardiac endoscopic tunneling technique (TCTT) for the resection of tumors in this area. A total of 18 patients with gastric fundus SMTs arising from the muscularis propria on endoscopic ultrasound underwent TCTT. The procedure involved the excavation of a submucosal tunnel from the esophagus, through the cardia, to the gastric SMT for resection. The tunnel was closed by clips after retrieval of the tumor. The mean tumor size was 2.1 cm (range 0.8 - 5.0 cm). The mean procedure time was 75.1 minutes (range 40 - 100 minutes). Complete resection was achieved in all cases. Iatrogenic perforation occurred in one case. This and one other patient developed mild pneumoperitoneum on the day after the procedure; symptoms resolved under conservative management. No patient developed gastrointestinal leakage, delayed bleeding, or secondary infection. Therefore, in this pilot study, TCTT provided a definitive histological diagnosis as well as a feasible, safe, and easy therapeutic approach for gastric fundus SMTs arising from muscularis propria in the circular area within 8 cm below the cardia."

Universally, the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging systems provided by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) are used for esophageal and gastric cancers. Accurate locoregional staging has become critical for the application of appropriate stage-specific treatment options in the multimodality treatment era in order to achieve better patient outcomes. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) represents a valuable minimally invasive real-time imaging modality for the assessment of upper GI tract tumors providing evidence for tumor invasion depth and regional nodal involvement corresponding to the T and N status of the TNM staging system, but a clear understanding of its diagnostic performance, limits and complementary role to other imaging modalities is required. This review will focus on the literature about the role and value of EUS in the TNM staging of esophageal and gastric carcinoma. In addition, an overview of the description of the current 7th editions of TNM staging and the revisions of the last editions compared to previous editions are presented."

His initial endoscopy revealed a viliform mass with dense eosinophilic infiltrate without neoplasia. Endoscopic ultrasound examination revealed a 4×1.6×0.7 cm mucosal hemicircumferential lesion without regional adenopathy. Pathological findings from the oesophagectomy specimen confirmed oesophageal papillomatosis with no malignancy. Surveillance endoscopy 4 months later revealed the lesion had increased in size. Additional ablative therapies failed, and the patient underwent oesophagectomy. Surveillance CT of the chest and abdomen at 3 months and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy at 6 months were negative. This case illustrates that oesophageal squamous papillomatosis not amenable to medical therapy requires surgical treatment."
CD009944,0,24784121,0,Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer remains the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Risk factors include family history, smoking, chronic pancreatitis, obesity, diabetes mellitus, heavy alcohol use, and possible dietary factors. Because more than two-thirds of adenocarcinomas occur in the head of the pancreas, abdominal pain, jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, and acholic stools may be presenting symptoms. In symptomatic patients, the serum tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 can be used to confirm the diagnosis and to predict prognosis and recurrence after resection. Pancreas protocol computed tomography is considered standard for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. Although surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, less than 20% of surgical candidates survive five years. The decision on resectability requires multidisciplinary consultation. Pancreatic resections should be performed at institutions that complete at least 15 of the surgeries annually. Postoperatively, use of gemcitabine or fluorouracil/leucovorin as adjuvant chemotherapy improves overall survival by several months. However, more than 80% of patients present with disease that is not surgically resectable. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine or irinotecan provides clinical benefit and modest survival improvement. Palliation should address pain control, biliary and gastric outlet obstruction, malnutrition, thromboembolic disease, and depression."

Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are the most common histologic types of gastric lymphoma. Despite its increasing incidence, diagnosis of gastric lymphoma is difficult at an earlier stage due to its nonspecific symptoms and endoscopic findings, and, thus, a high index of suspicion, and multiple, deep, repeated biopsies at abnormally and normally appearing sites in the stomach are needed. In addition, testing for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and endoscopic ultrasonography to determine the depth of tumor invasion and involvement of regional lymph nodes is essential for predicting response to H. pylori eradication and for assessment of disease progression. In addition, H. pylori infection and MALT lymphoma development are associated, and complete regression of low-grade MALT lymphomas after H. pylori eradication has been demonstrated.

In this study, we report a new case of this rare gastric tumor with a subset of tumor cells derived from smooth muscle differentiation. A 32-year-old Chinese man was admitted with a gastric mass. He did not experience any discomfort, and gastroscopy showed an elevated mass in the anterior wall of the gastric antrum. Endoscopic ultrasound examination revealed a focal hypoechoic lesion protruding into the lumen. A partial gastrectomy was performed, and the patient made an uneventful recovery and remains well 3 years later. The tumor in this case depicted all the typical histopathologic and immunochemical features of gastric PAMT, except that a small subset of tumor cells was partially immunoreactive for desmin and H-caldesmon. Based on the findings of this case, we think that PAMT may contain tumor cells derived from smooth muscle differentiation, and therefore this tumor may be more than just purely myofibroblastic in nature."

CD009944,0,24369919,0,Prognostic assessment and treatment of primary gastric lymphomas: how endoscopic ultrasonography can help in tailoring patient management.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has recently gained a pivotal role in the management of gastric lymphomas, especially in the diagnostic workup. Its accuracy and reliability have overcome those of other imaging techniques, such that it represents an invaluable tool for the management of gastric lymphomas. Although this technique is operator dependent, its application in large series has proved its reliability. Thus, it has generally been considered a useful tool for providing information crucial in deciding the treatment program, especially for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, for which EUS can provide an accurate evaluation of disease extension and treatment response probability. Limited-stage disease, confined to the submucosa, has a greater probability to respond to sole Helicobacter pylori eradication. In contrast, the value of EUS in response assessment and follow-up monitoring is still debated, with discordant opinions about its reliability and clinical advantages, because normalization of the EUS findings occurs with a considerable delay compared to the histologic evaluation. In the follow-up setting, preliminary data have indicated that persistently positive EUS findings in low-grade gastric lymphoma could represent a warning for a possible relapse. However, in high-grade gastric lymphoma, such findings do not have any clinical implications."

CD009944,0,24154498,0,[Treatment of gastric cancer].,"From a global perspective, gastric cancer including adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction is the fourth most common malignant tumor and the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Due to the lack of specific symptoms of early cancer, most gastric cancers are diagnosed in advanced stages. Staging should include high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis and documented video-endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound. In mucosal gastric cancer, endoscopic resection can replace surgical resection. In more advanced stages, perioperative chemotherapy has been established as a standard of care. In the metastatic setting, treatment goals are palliative. Chemotherapy can prolong survival, improve symptoms, and enhance the quality of life. Combination chemotherapy including a platinum salt plus fluoropyrimidine is the standard of care. About 16 % of gastric cancers exhibit overexpression of the growth factor receptor HER2.

Looking at the literature and analyzing recent personal data, neither pit-pattern classification, nor EUS, nor biopsy histology, nor lifting sign verification, nor digital examination allow a specificity of more than three fourth of such cases. The authors disquisition about which optimal treatment excludes a role for EMR for the impossibility to obtain a single en-bloc specimen, minimum requirement for a correct lateral and vertical margin assessment. For the same reason ESD should be preferred, although a recent meta-analysis of the literature defined that one fourth of patients undergoing ESD for a preoperatively assessed non-invasive large rectal lesion fail to receive an R0 en-bloc resection. This forces about 10% of patients treated by flexible endoscopy to undergo abdominal surgery, which is about fourfold higher than TEM. While awaiting further implementation of modern technologies both to improve staging and to reduce invasiveness, a full-thickness excision of the rectal wall by TEM still represents the standard treatment even for suspected benign diseases."

We present a case of 44-years-old male admitted to 2nd Department of General Surgery and Oncological Surgery Medical University for treatment of a submucosal gastric tumor detected in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT). Patient presented with no gastrointestinal disorders and the random endoscopy revealed a gastric tumor, but the biopsy of the lesion showed no carcinomas' cells and the suspicion of GIST. CT confirms the presence of the 5 cm large gastric tumor and intraabdominal lymphadenopathy. The patient was directed to surgery because of the malignant risk. The subtotal gastrectomy with BII anastomosis was performed and no perioperative complications were observed. The postoperative histopathological examination revealed a typical morphology and immunophenotype of tumor. The neoplastic cells were immunoreactive with S-100 protein, but lacked immunoreactivity with CD 117, CD 34 and smooth-muscle actin (SMA). The histopathologic features and immunohistochemical staining pattern were consistent with a gastric schwannoma. The lymph nodes resected, during the operation revealed reactive inflammatory changes without evidence of neoplastic cells and any malignancy. 10-month after the surgery patient has no complains but the follow up will be continued. This case underscores the importance of including gastric schwannomas in the differential diagnosis when preoperative imaging studies reveal a submucosal, exophytic gastric mass."

Endoscopic ultrasonography showed that the deepest layer of the tumor was the lamina propria mucosae (cT1a-LPM) and that the underlying muscularis propria was thinning. No distant metastasis or regional lymph node metastasis was detected. Diverticulectomy or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was out of indication due to the unclear margin and thin muscularis propria. We conducted mediastinoscopy-assisted esophagectomy.

CD009944,0,24379641,0,DOG1 is useful for diagnosis of KIT-negative gastrointestinal stromal tumor of stomach.,"Approximately 80%-95% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) show positive staining for KIT, while the other 5%-20% show negative staining. If the tumor is negative for KIT, but is positive for CD34, a histological diagnosis is possible. However, if the tumor is negative for KIT, CD34, S-100, and SMA, a definitive diagnosis is often challenging. Recently, Discovered on GIST-1 (DOG1) has received considerable attention as a useful molecule for the diagnosis of GIST. DOG1, a membrane channel protein, is known to be overexpressed in GIST. Because the sensitivity and specificity of DOG1 are higher than those of KIT, positive staining for DOG1 has been reported, even in KIT-negative GISTs. KIT-negative GISTs most commonly arise in the stomach and are mainly characterized by epithelioid features histologically. We describe our experience with a rare case of a KIT-negative GIST of the stomach that was diagnosed by positive immunohistochemical staining for DOG1 in a patient who presented with severe anemia. Our findings suggest that immunohistochemical staining for DOG1, in addition to gene analysis, is useful for the diagnosis of KIT-negative tumors that are suspected to be GISTs."

Subepithelial tumors (SETs) in the stomach are usually considered benign. However, some do have potential for malignant transformation, especially when originating in the muscularis propria (MP). Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric SETs originating in MP. MATERIAL AND METHODS. A total of 145 gastric MP SETs in 144 patients were treated by ESD between September 2008 and December 2012. Characteristics of patients and SETs, therapeutic outcomes, pathologic characteristics, complications and follow-up outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS. Among the 144 patients, 104 were female (72.22%) and 40 were male (27.78%), and the mean age was 55.75 ± 11.29 years (range 18-78 years). The mean size of the tumors determined by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was 15.14 ± 9.70 mm (range 3-50 mm). En bloc complete resection was achieved in 134 of 145 tumors, giving a complete resection rate of 92.41%. The final histopathologic diagnoses included 52 leiomyomas, 89 gastrointestinal stromal tumors, 3 neurogenic tumors and 1 lipoma. Perforations occurred in 21 patients (14.48%) and were endoscopically repaired with clips or nylon bands. Intraoperative bleeding occurred in seven patients (4.83%) and was corrected with argon plasma coagulation (APC) or hot biopsy forceps. No local recurrence or distant metastasis was detected during a mean follow-up of 19.14 ± 10.29 months (range 3-51 months). CONCLUSIONS. ESD appears to be an effective and safe treatment for gastric SETs originating in MP."

CD009944,0,24108557,0,Beyond the GIST: mesenchymal tumors of the stomach.,"Intramural gastric masses arise in the wall of the stomach (generally within the submucosa or muscularis propria), often with intact overlying mucosa. These tumors are typically mesenchymal in origin and have overlapping radiologic appearances. A combination of features such as location, attenuation, enhancement, and growth pattern may suggest one diagnosis over another. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) account for the majority of intramural tumors and can vary widely in appearance, from small intraluminal lesions to exophytic masses that protrude into the peritoneal cavity, commonly with areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. A well-circumscribed mass measuring -70 to -120 HU is a lipoma. Leiomyomas usually manifest as low-attenuation masses at the gastric cardia. Homogeneous attenuation is a noteworthy characteristic of schwannomas, particularly for larger lesions that might otherwise be mistaken for GISTs. A hypervascular mass in the antrum is a common manifestation of glomus tumors. Hemangiomas are also hypervascular but often manifest in childhood. Inflammatory fibroid polyps usually arise as a polypoid mass in the antrum. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors are infiltrative neoplasms with a propensity for local recurrence. Plexiform fibromyxomas are rare, usually antral tumors. Carcinoid tumors are epithelial in origin, but often submucosal in location, and therefore should be distinguished from other intramural lesions. Multiple carcinoid tumors are associated with hypergastrinemia, either in the setting of chronic atrophic gastritis or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Sporadic solitary carcinoid tumors not associated with hypergastrinemia have a higher rate of metastasis. Histopathologic analysis, including immunohistochemistry, is usually required for diagnosis of intramural masses."
CD009944,0,24078995,0,Gastric heterotopic pancreas can be identified by endoscopic direct imaging with submucosal endoscopy.,"Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is pancreatic tissue found outside the usual anatomical location of the pancreas, typically in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Asymptomatic HP is considered a benign submucosal tumor (SMT) that can be followed without intervention. However, invasive surgery or endoscopic resection is often inappropriately applied in cases of HP due to the difficulty of preoperative diagnosis by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and tissue sampling error. Therefore, it is very important to distinguish HP from neoplastic SMTs, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), preoperatively. Herein, we describe two asymptomatic gastric HP cases that were distinguished by endoscopic direct imaging (EDI) on submucosal endoscopy with a mucosal flap method (SEMF). In the two patients, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy failed to accurately diagnose two SMTs, consistent with the suspicion of a GIST on EUS. Accordingly, we attempted to perform bloc biopsy using SEMF as a novel method for obtaining tissue samples for two indefinite SMTs. Direct endoscopic imaging via a dissected submucosal tunnel revealed a yellowish, multi-nodular mass identified as pancreatic tissue. Histopathology of the bloc biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of HP. Our findings indicate that the characteristic EDI findings of gastric HP may distinguish these lesions from neoplastic SMTs. Additional evaluations of this approach are warranted."

Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is the non-invasive precursor of pancreatic cancer and gastritis cystica profunda (GCP) is considered a precursor of gastric cancer. As with most putative cancer precursor lesions, the diagnosis and treatment of these lesions has been controversial. A patient with no history of gastric surgery visited our institution for a regular evaluation. Endoscopy showed a 2 x 2 cm sized, protruding mass lesion with overlying normal mucosa on the fundus of stomach. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and computed tomography (CT) led to the possible diagnosis of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor with cystic change. Laparoscopic gastric wedge resection was performed with intra-operative endoscopic guidance. Microscopic examination identified the mass as pancreatic tissue. Furthermore, it demonstrated PanIN, grade 3 (PanIN-3) mixed pancreatobiliary and intestinal type, arising in the heterotopic pancreas and associated with GCP.

However, this tool is underused in evaluating rectal and perirectal lesions, possibly due to insufficient experience and underrecognized value of this procedure. In this study, we report our institutional experience with EUS-FNA as a diagnostic and staging tool for rectal and perirectal lesions. A retrospective chart review was performed and a cohort of 38 patients who underwent rectal EUS-FNA (41 specimens) at our institution between January 2002 and July 2012 was retrieved. The cytology diagnoses were compared with the concurrent or follow-up histologic and clinical diagnoses. Among the total 41 cases, rectal EUS-FNA was performed as a diagnostic procedure in 22 (54%) and a staging procedure in 19 (46%) cases. On cytology examination, 18 cases (44%) were diagnosed as malignant; 1 (2%), as atypical/suspicious for malignancy; 3 (7%), as benign neoplastic; 13 (32%), as nonneoplastic; and 6 (15%), as nondiagnostic cases. Concurrent or follow-up histologic diagnoses were available in 20 cases (48%), 19 of them had concordant cytological/histologic findings (10 benign, 9 malignant). One perirectal lymph node with negative cytology diagnosis was found to be positive on histologic examination, probably due to sampling error on cytology. The sensitivity and specificity of EUS-FNA for detecting malignant rectal/perirectal lesions in this study were 91% and 100%, respectively. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration is a useful diagnostic tool for rectal/perirectal lesions; it confirms or excludes malignancy for lesions with high or low clinical suspicions. It serves as a reliable staging method to identify patients for proper clinical management."

EUS examinations of 55 patients with histologically proven GLP were retrospectively studied. In all patients, EUS showed that lesions involved at least one-third of the circumference of the stomach. Based on the findings of the EUS, the 55 patients were divided into two groups. There were 32 (58.2%) patients in the first group. EUS of this group showed that the five sonographic layers had disappeared and had been replaced by a hypoechogenic thickening of the gastric wall. There were 23 (41.8%) patients in the second group. EUS of this group showed that the first three sonographic layers were blurred and thickened, and the fourth layer was significantly thickened. The full thickness of the gastric wall was significantly thicker in first than in the second group of patients (P<0.01). The incidence of perigastric lesions was significantly higher in the first than in the second group of patients (P<0.01). Results for the 15 patients following preoperative EUS were compared postoperatively with histopathologic findings for T and N staging. The overall diagnostic accuracy of the T stage was 73.3% and of the N stage was 60.0%. In eight patients, we used EUS to assess a therapeutic response. No response was observed in five patients and a partial response in three. EUS images of GLP are characteristic. EUS is helpful in diagnosing GLP and for assessing the T and N stages."
CD009944,0,23998446,0,"Gastroesophageal cancer: focus on epidemiology, classification, and staging.","Gastroesophageal cancer (GEC), comprising proximal esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and distal gastric cancer (GC), is a significant public health concern. The epidemiology of these tumors has significantly changed over the past several decades especially in developed countries. There is a recognized decrease in incidence and mortality of distal GC and an increase in incidence and mortality of proximal EGJ cancer. The changing epidemiology is thought to be mainly due to changing trends of risk factors such as lower incidence of Helicobacter pylori infection and increasing incidence of obesity and gastroesophageal reflux. Histologically, EGJ cancers are adenocarcinoma (AC), while distal esophagus may be squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or AC. Distal GC is predominantly AC. Following anatomical and histological distinction, tumors are staged with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), computerized tomography (CT), and often positron emission tomography (PET) with or without diagnostic laparoscopic and peritoneal washing. Accurate staging of tumors, with emphasis on excluding occult metastasis, is imperative to avoid unnecessary surgical resection. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how these tumors are classified, the associated epidemiology, and the current standards of staging prior to selecting the appropriate course of therapy. In this review we will discuss the epidemiology, classification, and staging of locally advanced GEC."

It commonly arises around the major joints or tendon sheaths in young adults, but is not commonly seen in the stomach. We experienced a case of primary gastric SS. The patient is a 22-year-old male, who presented with epigastric pain. Upper endoscopy showed an ulcer of 25 mm in diameter with marginal elevation on the posterior mid-gastric body. Biopsy of the ulcer base showed monotonous proliferation of small spindle-shaped cells on HE-stain. On immunohistochemical staining, these cells were positively stained with vimentin, cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and CD99, but were negative for KIT, CD34, desmin, and S-100 protein. These findings were compatible with SS of monophasic type. Diagnosis of primary gastric SS was made because there were no other primary lesions, nor metastatic lesions. The wedge resection was performed. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using the RNA from frozen neoplastic tissue of the resected specimen, detected a fusion gene called SYT-SSX1, specific for SS. Though SS arising in the stomach is rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of KIT-negative gastric spindle cell tumor."
CD009944,0,23902569,0,Submucosal tumors: comprehensive guide for the diagnosis and therapy of gastrointestinal submucosal tumors.,"Small submucosal tumors (SMT) without symptoms are frequently found by endoscopic and radiological examinations. To find proper diagnostic measures and therapeutic indications for histologically undiagnosed SMT, we reviewed published articles in PubMed between 1990 and March 2013 using the key words 'submucosal tumor' and the name of a specific disease. SMT is observed in a wide range of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and conditions, including compression by extra-GI organs and lesions, congenital tumors, inflammation, and benign as well as malignant neoplastic lesions. In the diagnosis of diseases and decision-making for therapy, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) may play a key role. Symptomatic SMT and SMT histologically diagnosed as malignant or potentially malignant tumors such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) should be treated by surgery. SMT >5 cm, SMT increasing in size and those with'high-risk features' including irregular border, heterogeneous internal echo such as anechoic area, and heterogeneous enhancement by contrast media may also be removed by surgery. Laparoscopic approach is feasible for gastric GIST <5 cm and this is considered less invasive than the open approach. Emerging techniques using flexible endoscopes appear less invasive, but require further evidence and are still under clinical study. Correct diagnosis of SMT is challenging; however, EUS and EUS-FNA are useful in the histological diagnosis and clinical decision-making. In the future, minimally invasive approaches may be a mainstream of surgical treatment for small SMT."

Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to these patients may be complicated, with endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), classically performed by gastroenterologists, playing a very important role. As this disease is not closely related to the ""digestive tract"", gastroenterologists have been forced to update their knowledge on this field o adequately diagnose this significant group of patients. The recent advent of modern and promising techniques like endobronchial ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EBUS-FNA) have prompted new approaches for diagnosis and staging of this type of patients. In this clinical guideline, the ""Sociedad Española de Endoscopia Digestiva"" (SEED), ""Sociedad Española de Patología Digestiva"" (SEPD) and the ""AsociaciónEspañola de Gastroenterología"", have jointed efforts to update the existing knowledge on the field and provide their members with evidence based recommendations."

Retrospective clinical study was conducted at the Clinic for Hematology and Clinic for Gastroenterology of the University Clinical Center of Sarajevo in the period of years 2002 to 2009. Patients (N = 40) with diagnosis of gastric lymphoma confirmed by pathohistological diagnosis were included in the study. Stage of the disease was determined based on EUS, proximal endoscopy, CT and ultrasound of abdomen, and classified according to the Ann Arbor classification. 39 patients had various types of non Hodgkin lymphoma and one patient had Hodgkin lymphoma. Based on morphological characteristics of gastric tumor visualized with EUS in 16 patients a gastric cancer was suspected. In 40% patients EUS finding was not confirmed by pathohistological finding. Compared both to CT and ultrasound of abdomen, EUS showed statistically significant higher frequency of establishing existence of infiltration (p < 0.001). In patients with primary gastric lymphoma EUS has more significant role in determination of stage of disease spread than for the diagnosis itself. Therefore EUS should be included into algorithm of patient diagnostic protocol when suspected to the malignant gastric disease."

A biopsy of the esophageal mass was performed and the pathologic findings with immunohistochemical stain for Mucin-5AC are proved to be identical to that of gastric adenocarcinoma, suggesting metastasis from main lesion of the gastric cancer. The lesion could not be explained by lymphatic or hematogenous spread, and its metastasis mechanism is considered to be different from previous studies. We suggest that the gastroesophageal reflux of cancer cells could be one of the possible metastatic pathways for metastasis of esophagus from an adenocarcinoma of the stomach."

CD009944,0,23722535,0,"Gastric carcinoma: imaging diagnosis, staging and assessment of treatment response.","Gastric carcinoma (GC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Surgical resection is the only cure available and is dependent on the GC stage at presentation, which incorporates depth of tumor invasion, extent of lymph node and distant metastases. Accurate preoperative staging is therefore essential for optimal surgical management with consideration of preoperative and/or postoperative chemotherapy. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) with its ability to assess tumor depth, nodal disease and metastases is the preferred technique for staging GC. Endoscopic ultrasonography is more accurate for assessing the depth of wall invasion in early cancer, but is limited in the assessment of advanced local or stenotic cancer and detection of distant metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although useful for staging, is not proven to be effective. Positron emission tomography (PET) is most useful for detecting and characterizing distant metastases. Both MDCT and PET are useful for assessment of treatment response following preoperative chemotherapy and for detection of recurrence after surgical resection. This review article discusses the usefulness of imaging modalities for detecting, staging and assessing treatment response for GC and the potential role of newer applications including CT volumetry, virtual gastroscopy and perfusion CT in the management of GC."

CD009944,0,23617646,0,Lessons from imperfect endoscopic submucosal dissection of rectal tumor.,"Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a standard endoscopic treatment for gastrointestinal tumors, but resections done in a piecemeal fashion are difficult to diagnose pathologically as curative resections, and the local recurrence rate is relatively high. Recently, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for colorectal tumors, which provides a higher complete resection rate than conventional EMR, has rapidly come into widespread use in Japan. However, colorectal ESD is still technically difficult and has complications such as perforation, and the procedure time is longer than that of conventional EMR. We report herein a case in which a rectal tumor was resected with an inappropriate specimen due to imperfect ESD. This lesion had severe fibrosis in the submucosal layer because the lesion had been injected with a solution for EMR in another hospital, which resulted in non-lifting signs, and had been subjected to many biopsies. During the ESD in our hospital, the submucosal layer was not clearly identified, and a small injury was caused in the specimen. A precise diagnosis based on histopathological findings could not be made because of the inappropriate specimen. Thus, expertise in both the diagnostic and the therapeutic aspects is required before treating large colorectal tumors."
CD009944,0,23613938,0,Noninvasive visualization of microRNA-16 in the chemoresistance of gastric cancer using a dual reporter gene imaging system.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated to play a central role in the development of drug resistance in a variety of malignancies. However, many studies were conducted at the in vitro level and could not provide the in vivo information on the functions of miRNAs in the anticancer drug resistance. Here, we introduced a dual reporter gene imaging system for noninvasively monitoring the kinetic expression of miRNA-16 during chemoresistance in gastric cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) and firefly luciferase (Fluc) genes were linked to form hNIS/Fluc double fusion reporter gene and then generate human gastric cancer cell line NF-3xmir16 and its multidrug resistance cell line NF-3xmir16/VCR. Radioiodide uptake and Fluc luminescence signals in vitro correlated well with viable cell numbers. The luciferase activities and radioiodide uptake in NF-3xmir16 cells were remarkably repressed by exogenous or endogenous miRNA-16. The NF-3xmir16/VCR cells showed a significant increase of (131)I uptake and luminescence intensity compared to NF-3xmir16 cells. The radioactivity from in vivo (99m)Tc-pertechnetate imaging and the intensity from bioluminescence imaging were also increased in NF-3xmir16/VCR compared with that in NF-3xmir16 tumor xenografts. Furthermore, using this reporter gene system, we found that etoposide (VP-16) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) activated miRNA-16 expression in vitro and in vivo, and the upregulation of miRNA-16 is p38MAPK dependent but NF-κB independent. This dual imaging reporter gene may be served as a novel tool for in vivo imaging of microRNAs in the chemoresistance of cancers, as well as for early detection and diagnosis in clinic."

With the development of endoscopic resection and multimodal treatment concepts, pretherapeutic tumor staging has gained in importance. However, the accuracy of present imaging modalities is still limited with a tendency towards overstaging of locally advanced tumors. Extended lymph node dissection cannot be recommended in cases with advanced lymph node involvement. In cardiac cancer retroperitoneal lymphatic spread to the left renal vein is an early event and should thus not be classified as stage IV disease. In cases of intra-abdominal gastrectomy a pouch reconstruction should be considered in cases with a good overall prognosis. Subgroup analyses indicate a differential therapeutic effect of the established perioperative chemotherapy depending on the location of the primary tumor. There is also good evidence for an additional beneficial effect of radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy."

The term inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor more commonly referred to as ""pseudostumor "", denotes a pseudosarcomatous inflammatory lesion that contains spindle cells, myofibroblasts, plasma cells, lymphocytes and histiocytes. It exhibits a variable biological behavior that ranges from frequently benign lesions to more aggressive variants. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor mostly occurs in the soft tissue of children and young adults, and the lungs are the most commonly affected site, but it has been recognized that any anatomic localization can be involved.

We herein reported a case of primary HS of the stomach which was confirmed through histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical staining. A 52-year-old woman presented with progressive difficulty in feeding and dull pain in the epigastric region. Gastroscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, double contrast examination, and computed tomography revealed a mass located on the posterior wall of fundus and lesser curvature of the stomach. Microscopically, the cytoplasm of the tumor cells was abundant and eosinophilic. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the tumor cells were positive for CD45RO and CD68. It is difficult to differentiate HS of stomach from other gastric malignancies by radiological evaluation alone. However, HS may be considered when a protruding and ulcerated mass in stomach shows heterogeneous hypervascular features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in English language literature that emphasizes the imaging findings of human gastric HS."

Our aim is to present two cases of large anorectal GIST treated with local excision through a new anterolateral trans-sphincteric approach followed by adjuvant therapy with imatinib. Two patients (both males, 68 and 63 years old) presented at our institution with anorectal GIST in the period October-November 2010. Their medical records, pathology results, and imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed. Both patients presented with an anterior perianal mass. Imaging studies were characteristic of GIST originating in the lower rectum, circumscribed by a pseudocapsule, and protruding into the ischiorectal fossa. Both patients underwent local excision via an anterolateral trans-sphincteric approach. Both tumors were removed intact, with microscopically negative margins. The maximum tumor diameter was 8 and 9 cm, and the diagnosis of GIST was confirmed by positive CD117 and CD34 staining in both cases. Both tumors had a high (>5/50HPF) mitotic index. The patients had an uneventful postoperative course and were discharged on days 5 and 6. Both patients were started on imatinib 400 mg bid postoperatively. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography computed tomography were carried out at 12 months and did not reveal any signs of recurrence. The patients are currently disease-free at 24 and 23 months of follow-up. In selected cases, complete excision of rectal GIST with negative margins is feasible via a trans-sphincteric approach. With the use of adjuvant therapy, which is currently advocated in all high-risk cases, it is possible that local excision with its reduced morbidity may become a viable alternative, especially in patients who would otherwise require abdominoperineal excision such as the two presented here. Prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm adequate oncologic results."

The holmium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser has precise tissue cutting ability and good hemostatic properties and has been widely applicated to soft tissue, but the use of endoscopic Ho:YAG laser ablation for early gastrointestinal cancer has not been reported. Twenty patients with biopsy-proven early GI cancer who had a high surgical risk or refused surgery were treated by endoscopic Ho:YAG laser ablation. The tumors of all patients were confined to the mucosal layer without ulceration and without lymph node metastasis. The tumor diameter was not more than 2.5 cm. Endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and computed tomography scan were performed 1-3 months after the treatment, and a biopsy was performed to evaluate the effects of the therapy. Long-term endoscopic follow-up was maintained. Complete eradication was achieved in all the 20 patients, including four patients with high-grade dysplasia associated with focal canceration, seven patients with well-differentiated squamous cell cancer, and nine patients with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, resulting in a complete response rate of 100% at 1-3 months after treatment. No recurrence was found during 36-73 months of follow-up in all 20 patients. No operative or delayed complications were observed in any of the 20 patients. Preliminary study shows that endoscopic Ho:YAG laser ablation may be an effective, safe, and minimally invasive method for selected patients with early GI intramucosal cancer. Further research is required to confirm the safety and efficacy of this technique compared to its alternative techniques in a multicenter randomized controlled trial."
CD009944,0,23288709,0,Fiber-optic Raman spectroscopy probes gastric carcinogenesis in vivo at endoscopy.,"Intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis is a complex multi-step disease, and early precursors (e.g. intestinal metaplasia (IM), dysplasia) can be very challenging to identify using conventional white-light endoscopic imaging. This study aims to assess the capability of Raman spectroscopy for multi-class elucidation of intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis sequence in vivo for improving precancer detection at endoscopy. We employ a novel image-guided Raman endoscopy technique developed for in vivo gastric tissue Raman measurement within 0.5 s during clinical endoscopic examination. We have acquired a total of 1277 in vivo Raman spectra from 83 gastric patients associated with intestinal-type carcinogenesis. In vivo Raman spectroscopy integrated with semi-quantitative spectral modelling (e.g. DNA, lipids, glycoprotein, proteins and blood) reveals the progressive changes of biochemical constituents in gastric tissue associated with preneoplastic and neoplastic transformation (i.e., IM, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma). Multi-class probabilistic partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) diagnostic algorithms based on in vivo Raman spectra are able to identify normal mucosa with sensitivity of 75.88% and specificity of 87.21%; IM with sensitivity of 46.67% and specificity of 87.55%; dysplasia with sensitivity of 83.33%; specificity of 95.80%, and adenocarcinoma with sensitivity of 84.91% and specificity 95.57%, respectively. This work demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive biomolecular probe for monitoring intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis to realize early diagnosis and detection of precancer and early gastric cancer in vivo during clinical endoscopic examination."

In this case series, we aimed to analyze the EUS and CT characteristics of gastric glomus tumors. Seven patients with gastric glomus tumors were retrospectively enrolled in this study. EUS showed that all the tumors were located in the fourth EUS layer (muscularis propria) and had distinct borders. The tumors had a heterogeneous appearance with either hypo- or hyperechogenicity, and all the tumors except one had the characteristic peripheral halo around them. On CT scans,all the tumors appeared as well-defined SMT with a clear margin and showed the same characteristics in the different phases of CT. During dynamic contrast-enhanced CT, the tumors showed strong enhancement in the arterial phase and prolonged enhancement in the delayed phase. This case series shows the characteristic EUS findings and the distinguishing features of CT scans for gastric glomus tumors; these findings will help in differentiating gastric glomus tumors from other SMT."

CD009944,0,22642487,0,Can common hepatic artery lymph node dissection be safely omitted in surgery for clinical T1N0 thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma?,"Common hepatic artery lymph node dissection is regarded as a standard procedure in esophageal cancer surgery because of aggressive lymphatic dissemination of esophageal cancer. However, lymph node dissection can prolong operation time and may be associated with complications such as chylous ascites. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of common hepatic artery lymph node dissection in clinical T1N0 thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Between 1996 and 2009, 1390 patients underwent surgery for esophageal cancer in our institution, and 209 were found to have clinical T1N0 disease. Exclusion criteria were nonsquamous carcinoma, double primary cancer, definite distant metastasis, administration of neoadjuvant treatment, and incomplete abdominal lymph node dissection. We retrospectively analyzed medical records, operative and pathologic data, and follow-up information. Forty-two patients were excluded from the study. Among the 167 enrolled patients, preoperative endoscopic ultrasound evaluation was performed in 160 patients. Fifty-two patients had distal esophageal or esophagogastric junction tumor. Surgery included 2 cases of tri-incisional esophagectomy, 17 cases of transhiatal esophagectomy, and 148 cases of two-field esophagectomy (Ivor Lewis operation). Common hepatic artery lymph node dissection was performed in all cases, and none of the patients had metastasis. Mean follow-up period was 35.4 ± 28.7 months. In-hospital mortality was one, and 5-year survival rate was 80.6%. Among the 15 patients with recurrence, there were two distant metastases and five distant and local recurrences but no intra-abdominal recurrence with common hepatic artery lymph node. Common hepatic artery lymph node dissection may be safely omitted in surgery for clinical T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma when preoperative evaluations including chest computed tomography, positron emission tomography and computed tomography, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy or endoscopic ultrasound are performed."

CD009944,0,2279643,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosis of the extent of gallbladder carcinoma.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed preoperatively in 39 patients with gallbladder carcinoma. Diagnosis of the anatomical extent of gallbladder carcinoma was compared with histologic analysis, and staging accuracy was evaluated according to the TNM classification. Carcinoma considered to be at an early stage with no lymph node metastasis was correctly diagnosed in 87.5%. Differential diagnosis between early and advanced staged tumors was possible in 79.5%. Overall accuracy for depth of tumor invasion (T) was 76.9%. Limitations were due to many stones in the gallbladder and microinfiltration of carcinoma. Assessment of regional lymph node metastasis (N) was at a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 92.9%, for an overall accuracy of 89.7%. We believe endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in the clinical staging of gallbladder carcinoma."
CD009944,0,11979247,0,Interobserver agreement in staging gastric malt lymphoma by EUS.,"EUS is highly accurate for staging gastric lymphoma.

CD009944,0,8365597,0,Delineation of the gastric muscularis mucosae and assessment of depth of invasion of early gastric cancer using a 20-megahertz endoscopic ultrasound probe.,"Using a 20 MHz endoscopic ultrasound system, delineation of the gastric muscularis mucosae and estimation of the depth of malignant invasion was attempted by in vivo scanning during the process of routine endoscopic observation or in vitro scanning of excised sections of 34 early gastric cancers in 32 patients. The muscularis mucosae was visualized as a single hypoechoic layer in 16 of 32 lesions (50%) scanned in vitro. Comparison of lesions in which delineation of the muscularis mucosae was or was not possible revealed no significant differences with respect to either the thickness of the lamina propria and muscularis mucosae or with respect to the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration of the lamina propria or the conditions of the boundary between the lamina propria and the muscularis mucosae. This indicates that improvement of the operability characteristics of the ultrasonic apparatus will be needed to achieve improved delineation of the muscularis mucosae. The accuracy of invasion depth estimation of early gastric cancer was 67% (16 of 24 lesions scanned in vivo) and 73% (8 of 11 lesions) in cases in vivo where the muscularis mucosae and the tumor were delineated on the same screen. The principal factors causing erroneous staging were the presence of dilated benign glandular ducts, ulcer scars, and attenuation of the ultrasound waves."

CD009944,0,8514069,0,Carcinoid tumors of the gastrointestinal tract: evaluation with endoscopic ultrasonography.,"To evaluate the usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonography for carcinoid tumors, we examined 29 patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors (5 gastric, 7 duodenal, and 17 rectal). The smallest size detectable by endoscopic ultrasonography was 2 mm in diameter histologically. The cross-sectional image of the tumors was primarily oval to round. The internal echo was generally hypoechoic and homogeneous. The margins were clearly visualized, and the contour was somewhat smooth. The tumors were mainly located in the third layer. The second layer covered the tumor with the third layer at its base, and it abutted the tumor and became indistinct near its upper interface. These findings were especially recognized in lesions with submucosal invasion and were similar at all sites. The overall accuracy of determining the depth of invasion using endoscopic ultrasonography was 75% (27 of 36 lesions). Limited to the lesions detectable by endoscopic ultrasonography, the accuracy was 90%. Endoscopic ultrasonography was useful in determining the presence of local metastases. Moreover, endoscopic ultrasonography allowed direct detection of perigastrointestinal lymph node metastases (75%, three of four patients). In conclusion, endoscopic ultrasonography was found to be useful for the staging of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors by determining depth of involvement and presence of perigastrointestinal lymph node metastases."

CD009944,0,8929802,0,The TNM staging system.,"The new TNM staging system for cancer has great importance because of its applicability for imaging techniques, particularly clinical staging by EUS. The close correlation between clinical (EUS) and pathologic staging permits clinicians to define the strategy for treatment based on the stage of the cancer. In cases where lymph node metastasis is suspected, EUS-guided FNA can be performed for confirmation of this diagnosis by cytology. In the era of minimally invasive surgery, EUS will become the most important diagnostic modality for defining early stage malignant disease. In such cases endoscopic or surgical resection can be performed. When a tumor is shown by EUS to be nonresectable, it will become important to avoid explorative surgery. Despite some limitations, both the TNM classification and EUS clinical staging will be used with increasing frequency in the clinical management of patients with cancer. Furthermore, refinements in the TNM staging system, such as adoption of subclassifications of early cancers and clarification of the definition of regional lymph node involvement, will be necessary to optimize clinical staging. Technologic improvement of EUS instruments, particularly in miniaturization of the echoprobe, will improve the integration of EUS as a routine procedure for cancer staging."
CD009944,0,7859967,0,Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration.,"Thirty-eight consecutive patients underwent endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Of 46 lesions, 34 were extraluminal (12 pancreatic masses, 8 periesophageal nodes, 6 celiac nodes, 2 pericolonic masses, 1 mediastinal mass, 1 perigastric mass, 1 liver, 1 periduodenal node, 1 perirectal mass, 1 perirectal node) and 12 were submucosal (8 gastric, 3 duodenal, 1 esophageal). One hundred sixty-three passes were made, with an average of 3.5 passes per lesion and 4.3 passes per patient (range, 1 to 8). Adequate specimens were obtained from 91% of targeted lesions. The overall diagnostic accuracy was 87%. In patients with malignant lesions, sensitivity was 91% and specificity 100%. Celiac nodes were successfully sampled and diagnostic in 5 of 6 (83%) patients. No complications occurred. Using this technique, an initial tissue diagnosis of malignancy was made in 66% of cancer patients without a previous diagnosis and the preoperative stage was changed in 44% of cancer patients. The additional information gained by this modality directly influenced the decision not to perform surgery in 26% of patients with a primary malignancy. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is feasible and can be safely used to evaluate submucosal and extraluminal lesions in both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract with a high degree of diagnostic accuracy."

CD009944,0,1473669,0,Evaluation of endoscopic ultrasonography in the pre-operative staging of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater and common bile duct.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed in 23 patients with carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (ampulla) and in 16 patients with common bile duct (CBD) carcinoma. These patients all underwent surgery. The layered structures of the duodenum, ampulla, and CBD, and the pancreas, portal vein, and regional lymph nodes were clearly identified by EUS using a transduodenal approach. With this technique, ampullary carcinoma appeared as a hypoechoic mass in 22 of 23 patients, and the 1 remaining cancer was not detected because of its small size. Carcinoma of the CBD also appeared as a hypoechoic mass in 12 of 16 patients. However, the remaining four appeared as hyperechoic masses. For these tumors, EUS had a high tumor detection rate (96 to 100%). In this regard, EUS was comparable to ERCP and was better than ultrasonography (US), CT, and angiography. Using EUS, we were also able to stage the extent of these tumors according to the involvement of the duodenal or CBD walls, invasion of the pancreas and portal vein, and spread to regional lymph nodes. The accuracy rates of cancer extent by EUS were 78% for ampullary carcinoma and 81% for CBD carcinoma when compared with surgical findings. We conclude that EUS is a valuable method for the detection and staging of tumors of the ampulla and CBD."

CD009944,0,1511822,1,"Local staging and assessment of resectability in carcinoma of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum by endoscopic ultrasonography.","Eighty-eight patients with carcinoma of the esophagus (N = 44), stomach (N = 41), and duodenum (N = 3) who underwent surgery were pre-operatively examined by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). The ability of EUS to accurately predict the T stage and the N stage was 82% and 70% for esophageal carcinoma, 71% and 75% for gastric cancer, and 100% and 66% for duodenal malignancy. In esophageal carcinoma, the accuracy of T staging was only slightly lower in cases with non-traversable tumor stenoses (77%) compared with traversable carcinomas (84%). This was probably due to the fact that all non-traversable tumors were either in stage T3 or T4. The accuracy of EUS in predicting the stages T1 to T3, which correspond to R0 resectability (no macroscopic or microscopic tumor remains), was 92% for adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and 85% for gastric cancer. However, in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, R0 resection was possible in only 66% of all cases, whereas EUS predicted an 84% R0 resection rate. In adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and stomach, EUS prediction of stages T1 to T3 correlated well with the actual rate of R0 resection. These results show that EUS is a reliable diagnostic method for the local staging of upper gastrointestinal cancer. Its impact on treatment and hence on prognosis of patients with these malignancies has yet to be determined."
CD009944,0,8365600,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer invasion.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography was pre-operatively performed in 164 patients with colorectal cancer, and the resected specimens confirmed to be cancerous histologically. Normal colorectal wall was visualized by endoscopic ultrasonography as a five-layered structure. The first, third, and fifth layers were hyperechoic, and the second and fourth layers were hypoechoic. The first and second layers comprised the mucosa, the third layer the submucosa, the fourth layer the muscularis propria, and the fifth layer the subserosa and serosa (adventitia). By this technique, cancer of the colon appeared as a hypoechoic mass with an intermediate echo level between the third hyperechoic and fourth hypoechoic layers. Endoscopic ultrasonographic determination of the depth of tumor invasion was based on abnormal changes of these layered structures and adjacent organs. Overall, the accuracy rate of endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of the depth of colorectal cancer was 83%. A hypoechoic round mass adjacent to the cancer was interpreted as a metastatic lymph node. The sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis were 68% and 70%, respectively. The overall accuracy rate of tumor staging by endoscopic ultrasonography according to Dukes' classification was 62%. Endoscopic ultrasonography is a valuable tool in the management of colorectal cancer. It has a high accuracy rate in determining the depth of tumor invasion. The pre-operative information obtained with this tool may influence the choice of therapy."

CD009944,0,7672544,0,Malignant esophageal strictures: staging accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography.,"The prognosis for patients with carcinoma of the esophagus remains poor despite aggressive combination therapies and radical surgical resections. Accuracy of staging esophageal carcinoma by endoscopic ultrasonography is unmatched by that of any other modality. Of patients with esophageal carcinoma, 20% to 36% present with high-grade malignant strictures that preclude passage of the echoendoscope. Aggressive wire-guided dilation followed by complete endoscopic ultrasonographic assessment or endosonography limited to the proximal aspect of the stricture has been used in staging these patients. Of 204 patients with esophageal carcinoma, 51 (25%) presented with high-grade malignant strictures, defined as stenosis precluding passage of the echoendoscope without prior dilation. Thirty-nine of the 51 patients were treated by esophageal resection. Twenty-one of these patients underwent preoperative staging using wire-guided dilation followed by endoscopic ultrasonography, whereas 18 underwent limited endosonographic staging. Correct preoperative assessment of depth of tumor invasion (T stage) was obtained in 33% (7 of 21) of the former group and 28% (5 of 18) of the latter group. Advanced tumor stage (stage III or IV) was present in 90% (35 of 39) of patients presenting with high-grade strictures, indicating a poor prognosis for those patients. The current study demonstrates that (1) approximately 25% of all patients with esophageal carcinoma present with high-grade stricutres that preclude passage of the echoendoscope without prior dilation, (2) the majority of patients with high-grade malignant strictures present with advanced disease (stage III or IV), and (3) because of the low accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography in staging high-grade strictures, the need to subject such patients to invasive staging studies is questionable."

CD009944,0,23290296,0,Pretherapeutic evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal tract cancer using endoscopic and laparoscopic ultrasonography.,"A detailed and correct pretherapeutic evaluation of stage and resectability is mandatory for an optimal treatment strategy and results in patients with cancer of the esophagus, stomach or pancreas (UGIC). Curative surgery should only be attempted in patients with limited extent of their disease, patients with locally advanced disease should be allocated for neo-adjuvant therapy, while the remaining patients should be referred for palliative measures following a quick, lenient and correct pretherapeutic evaluation. This thorough evaluation and subsequent treatment assignment is also valuable in the identification of uniform patient cohorts for new treatment protocols as well as for the continuing comparison of research data. But despite the importance of accurate pretherapeutic assessment being repeatedly emphasized insufficient staging has been - and is still accepted as - leading to high rates of explorative surgery as well as heterogeneous selection of patients for new treatment trials. Based on the results from the authors PhD thesis he concluded that endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) as a single imaging modality provided detailed information that hitherto had been inaccessible. EUS was considered a significant progress regarding the loco-regional assessment of stage and resectability, but it was also evident that EUS alone was incapable of providing all the necessary information. In addition, there were no evidence regarding the EUS safety profile, patient tolerance of the procedure and no data on the clinical impact of both EUS and EUS guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) in UGIC patients. Therefore, the author chose to conduct additional EUS trials and to test the use of EUS-FNA, laparoscopy (LAP), laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) and LUS guided biopsy in order to improve the overall pretherapeutic evaluation and thus the patient selection. The aim of this thesis was to describe the sequential development, testing and clinical results of a new pretherapeutic evaluation strategy based on EUS and LUS."
CD009944,0,23198557,0,[Diagnosis of the depth of gastric cancer invasion by endoscopic ultrasonography].,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is useful to diagnose the depth of invasion because of obtaining tomographic image of gastric cancer.

In March 2010, a submucosal tumor of 35mm was identified with endoscopy and a low echoic mass was identified with endoscopic ultrasonography. After histologic diagnosis by endosonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy, he underwent a total gastrectomy. Histologic examination of the resected specimen revealed a tumor 20mm in diameter consisting of well-to-moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the thickened wall of the gastric greater curvature, which contained small cystic lesions in the lamina propria. Immunohistochemical staining showed thick gastric wall consisting of not only multiple cysts but also smooth muscle, elastic and collagen fibers. The histologic diagnosis was advanced gastric cancer accompanied by diffuse cystic malformation (DCM). Although it is a rare condition, DCM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of giant gastric folds and as a pre-cancerous lesion."

CD009944,0,23065169,0,Ovarian carcinomatosis: how the radiologist can help plan the surgical approach.,"Ovarian carcinoma is the most common cause of death due to gynecologic malignancy. Peritoneal involvement is present in approximately 70% of patients at the time of initial diagnosis. The disease spreads abdominally by direct extension, exfoliation of tumor cells into the peritoneal space, and dissemination of tumor cells along lymphatic pathways. Carcinomatosis characterizes an advanced stage of disease in which peritoneal disease has spread throughout the upper abdomen (stage IIIC) or in which diffuse peritoneal disease is accompanied by malignant pleural infiltration or visceral metastases (stage IV). Common sites of intraperitoneal seeding of ovarian carcinoma include the pelvis, omentum, paracolic gutters, liver capsule, and diaphragm. Soft-tissue thickening, nodularity, and enhancement are all signs of peritoneal involvement. Advanced-stage disease is treated either with initial cytoreductive surgery (debulking) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, or with initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by debulking. Radiologic imaging plays an important role in the selection of patients who may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy before debulking. However, accurate interpretation of the imaging findings is challenging and requires a detailed knowledge of the complex peritoneal anatomy, directionality of flow of peritoneal fluid, and specific disease sites that are likely to present particular difficulties with regard to surgical access and technique. Although there is as yet no clear consensus on the criteria for resectability of peritoneal lesions, extensive involvement of the small bowel or mesenteric root, involved lymph nodes superior to the celiac axis, pleural infiltration, pelvic sidewall invasion, bladder trigone involvement, and hepatic parenchymal metastases or implants near the right hepatic vein are considered indicative of potential nonresectability. Implants larger than 2 cm in diameter in the diaphragm, lesser sac, porta hepatis, intersegmental fissure, gallbladder fossa, or gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic ligament also may represent nonresectable disease."

CD009944,0,23001857,0,Endoscopic ultrasonographic assessment of gastric polyps and endoscopic mucosal resection.,"Gastric polyps refer to a heterogeneous group of epithelial- and subepithelial-based lesions that vary in histology and malignant potential. Although many gastric polyps have characteristic endoscopic appearances, their diagnosis, classification, and potential for malignant transformation are based on histologic evaluation. Therefore, all types of gastric polyps should be biopsied during the incident endoscopy. Mucosal-based polyps include fundic gland polyps, hyperplastic polyps, adenomatous polyps, and hamartomatous polyps. Inflammatory fibroid polyps may endoscopically appear similar to mucosal-based polyps but actually arise from the submucosa. Certain types of polyps are associated with genetic syndromes or potential precancerous conditions (gastric intestinal metaplasia and chronic atrophic gastritis). If dysplasia is present and the polyp is ≥2 cm or symptomatic, the polyp should be endoscopically resected with the aim of en bloc resection. There are limited data on the use of adjunctive endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the evaluation of mucosal-based gastric polyps, and therefore, is not routinely employed in the management of these lesions. EUS is recommended for the evaluation of gastric subepithelial lesions."
CD009944,0,22978826,0,Modified endoscopic submucosal dissection with enucleation for treatment of gastric subepithelial tumors originating from the muscularis propria layer.,"Gastric subepithelial tumors are usually asymptomatic and observed incidentally during endoscopic examination. Although most of these tumors are considered benign, some have a potential for malignant transformation, particularly those originating from the muscularis propria layer. For this type of tumor, surgical resection is the standard treatment of choice. With recent advent of endoscopic resection techniques and devices, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been considered as an alternative way of treatment. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a modified ESD technique with enucleation for removal of gastric subepithelial tumors originating from the muscularis propria layer, and to evaluate its efficacy and safety."

CD009944,0,22878576,0,[Modern diagnostics and stage-oriented surgery: therapy of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction].,"The basis for decision-making about an individualized surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction is tumor staging and exact evaluation of the topography of the tumor in the small junctional area. The diagnostics mainly comprise endoscopy, biopsy, endosonography, computed tomography and partially diagnostic laparoscopy. This results in a clinical TNM staging and an evaluation according to the AEG classification from oral to aboral in type I (esophagus), type II (cardia) and type III (subcardia). Endoscopic resection is only appropriate for the infrequent mucosal carcinomas whereas the majority of the junctional carcinomas are treated by surgical resection. This is combined with neoadjuvant treatment in case of T3 or resectable T4 carcinomas. A type I carcinoma is removed by radical transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy with high intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy after gastric pull-up. In case of type II or III carcinomas, a transhiatal extended gastrectomy including distal esophageal resection is performed with reconstruction by Roux en Y esophagojejunostomy in the lower mediastinum. However, some advanced type II carcinomas which cannot be resected R0 at the esophagus need esophagectomy and gastric pull-up. This surgical strategy is justified by the topography of the lesion and the corresponding lymphatic drainage. Very rare indications are seen for a limited resection with interposition of small bowel in some mucosal carcinomas or total esophagogastrectomy with colon interposition in very advanced tumors. The neoadjuvant treatment comprises especially chemoradiation for type I and chemotherapy for type II and III carcinomas and leads to a significant survival benefit compared to surgery alone."

Objective is to evaluate the usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonograph (EUS) combined with position emission tomography and computed tomograph (PET-CT) in gastric cancer staging. A total of 124 patients confirmed with gastric cancer were subjected to staging with EUS and PET-CT scanning. The detection rate of primary tumor was 99.2% by combination use of two modalities and 97.6% by EUS alone (p = 0.6219), but the detection rate was 90.3% (112 of 124) by PET-CT alone (compared with the combination, p = 0.0027; compared with EUS alone, p = 0.0299). The locoregional lymph node invasion was identified in 84/124 (67.7%) by combined PET-CT and EUS, which was obviously higher than that with EUS (52.4%) or PET-CT (43.5%) alone (p = 0.0194 and p = 0.0002, respectively). There was no statistical difference in identification of celiac axis lymph node metastasis among three methods, but the combined examination or PET-CT alone was more effective than EUS alone in the detection of distant metastases (all p < 0.01). Furthermore, the combined EUS and PET-CT was more optimal than using EUS or PET-CT alone in the accurate T and N staging and the effect on change of treatment. The present study indicates that the combination of EUS and PET-CT is an ideal modality in the preoperative staging of gastric cancer and it provides beneficial guidance for the treatment of gastric cancer."

We here report a case of a 71-year-old woman with a solitary Peutz-Jeghers type polyp of the stomach who presented with intolerable epigastric pain and weight loss of 5 kg over the prior two months. During the hospital treatment course for this patient, endoscopic examination revealed a bulging lesion with a central hole, mucosal ulceration, an asymmetrical wall thickness and a narrowing of the gastric lumen. A gastric biopsy further revealed ulceration with moderate dysplasia. The patient received endoscopic ultrasonography which showed a second subepithelial lesion that measured 4 cm × 3 cm. Computed tomography of the abdomen subsequently showed a thickened gastric wall with three visibly enlarged lymph nodes, all greater than 1 cm. The suspected diagnosis was malignant gastric cancer with lymph node metastases. The other lesion, which measured 2 cm × 2 cm × 1 cm was noted in the submucosa of the jejunum during surgery. The patient was treated using a subtotal gastrectomy and partial resection of the jejunal tumor. The final pathological report indicated a gastric Peutz-Jeghers type polyp with proliferation of smooth muscle bundles in the submucosal layer, and hyperplastic glands in the mucosal layer and ectopic pancreas of the jejunum.

Between 1991 and 2009, 61 patients with tumors in the GEJ (Siewert type II and III) underwent primary surgical resection. Thirty of 61 patients had type II tumors (49.2%) and 31 had type III tumors (50.8%). The tumor size was larger in type III tumors than type II tumors (P = 0.0026). The overall 5-year survival rates in patients with type II tumors and type III tumors were 44.2 per cent and 41.4 per cent, respectively, with no significant differences (P = 0.1888). The independent survival factors were lower mediastinal lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0323) and a noncurative resection (P = 0.0442). The independent survival factors for patients who underwent curative resections were the tumor size (P = 0.0422), M category (P = 0.0489), and lower mediastinal lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0482). This study showed lower mediastinal lymph node metastasis to be an independent survival factor, and also suggested that lower mediastinal lymph node metastasis was associated with distant metastasis in patients with adenocarcinoma in the GEJ (Siewert type II and III). Therefore, the preoperative early detection of such metastasis is important to improve patient survival."

For biological soft tissue, SR-PCI can give better imaging contrast than conventional X-ray absorption imaging. In this study, human resected stomach and gastric cancer were investigated using in-line holography and diffraction enhanced imaging at beamline 4W1A of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. It was possible to depict gastric pits, measuring 50-70 µm, gastric grooves and tiny blood vessels in the submucosa layer by SR-PCI. The fine structure of a cancerous ulcer was displayed clearly on imaging the mucosa. The delamination of the gastric wall and infiltration of cancer in the submucosa layer were also demonstrated on cross-sectional imaging. In conclusion, SR-PCI can demonstrate the subtle structures of stomach and gastric cancer that cannot be detected by conventional X-ray absorption imaging, which prompt the X-ray diagnosis of gastric disease to the level of the gastric pit, and has the potential to provide new methods for the imageology of gastric cancer."

Gastric carcinoid type 1 is associated with chronic atrophic gastritis, and because of a low metastatic potential, is the most benign type. Death from metastatic disease has been reported in only three patients in a review including 724 cases. The present report refers to a 60-year-old man who was affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus and pernicious anemia and died from metastatic gastric carcinoid type 1. In 1998, a well-differentiated 1.2 cm gastric neuroendocrine tumor, immunoreactive for chromogranin A, with a Ki-67 index less than 2% and with infiltration to the submucosal layer was diagnosed and enucleated. In 2002, a new well-differentiated gastric endocrine tumor 6 mm in size with a Ki-67 of approximately 2% was detected, and endoscopic ultrasound confirmed it to be limited to the submucosal layer. The patient refused antrectomy and started long-acting somatostatin analog (lanreotide) in 2005 when the Ki-67 index was 7%, but he stopped the treatment after 4 months. In 2007, despite previous endoscopic stability, endoscopic ultrasound showed an infiltrating gastric lesion of 7 cm. At surgery, the disease appeared to be extended to the liver and to the peritoneum (well-differentiated endocrine carcinoma, Ki-67 40%) with both hepatic and massive peritoneal metastases. A regimen of somatostatin analog was soon restarted; however, the disease continued to spread, and the patient died 6 months later. Overall, despite their generally benign course, type 1 gastric carcinoids may have malignant potential, a finding that should be considered when planning the medical workup of these patients."

We performed endoscopic submucosal dissection on a 65-year-old male with early gastric cancer in April 2005, and pathology revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, 21 × 10 mm in size, SM1 invasion depth and negative lymphovascular invasion as well as tumor-free margins, so the case was diagnosed as a curative resection. This case, however, resulted in lymph node metastasis that was diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration biopsy in May 2009. Distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection was then performed, confirming lymph node metastasis from the original gastric cancer."

On pathological examination, GP is characterized by the association of the histological features of paragangliomas, ganglioneuromas, and carcinoid tumors. Classical clinical presentations are upper gastrointestinal bleeding and abdominal pain. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult because of the submucosal site of the tumor, with usually negative mucosal biopsies. Endoscopic ultrasound helps establish the diagnosis and allows lymph node staging, which will guide the choice of the treatment. If GPs usually follow a benign course, metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes treated by surgical resection alone has been reported. We report a case of GP with lymph node metastases treated by duodenopancreatectomy with long-term disease-free survival, suggesting that surgical resection is a reasonable approach for metastatic GPs."

CD009944,0,21842399,0,Esophageal cancer characterization with pneumo-64-MDCT.,"Early diagnosis and accurate staging of esophageal cancer are both essential for therapeutic strategy planning. Endoscopic ultrasound, CT, and positron emission tomography have all been used in the preoperative staging of esophageal cancer separately or in various combinations. Each imaging method has its strengths and weaknesses. Depiction of the tumor's anatomic location conditions the surgical strategy. Endoscopic ultrasound and PET have important advantages but neither provides information for surgical planning. CT scans have some limitations for hollow organ assessment in the absence of lumen distension, since the organ wall may be collapsed. Therefore, optimal esophageal distension could be very useful to overcome these limitations. This potential drawback is crucial at the level of the GE junction, a typically difficult region to evaluate. In order to optimize tumor visualization in the esophageal wall and in the GE junction, we developed a technique named pneumo-64-MDCT. We achieve maximum lumen distension, which better highlights the thickened areas in relation to the normal esophageal wall. At the present time, we have performed 200 studies with this technique and it proved useful, safe and accurate to identify esophageal wall thickening and to stage esophageal cancer. The additional stomach distension led to an adequate definition of both the upper and lower borders of the lesion in tumors located in the GE junction, which in turn was helpful to design the surgical approach."

We herein report on a case of ectopic pancreatic cancer developed in the stomach. A neoplastic lesion was detected in the pyloric part in an upper GIS of a 76-year-old female, requiring biopsy, but because it was classified as Group I, it was observed temporarily. Following blood collection after approximately 2 years, the CA19-9 increased from 177.5 to 279.5, so a GIS was again performed. Although the pyloric part of the stomach became more stenosed than before, it was still considered Group I disease based on biopsy findings. When EUS was performed, the tumor appeared as a submucosal tumor, and was thus suspected as GIST. In an abdominal CT, a neoplastic lesion with a clear boundary was observed in the pylorus, as was an enlarged lymph node in the hepatoduodenal ligament. Therefore malignancy could not be ruled out, and a gastrectomy on the pylorus side, lymph node dissection (D2), and cholecystectomy were performed. The tumor was a submucosal tumor covered by a coherent mucosa. According to histopathological findings, it was diagnosed as ectopic pancreatic cancer developed in the ectopic pancreas (Heinrich type II), consisting of acinar tissue and capillary tubes.

About 1 - 2 % of pancreatic neoplasias are neuroendocrine tumours. About one third of these tumours secrete biologically active substances that lead to development of specific clinical syndromes. PNET may occur sporadically or in association with hereditary syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). Among the functional PNET, insulinomas and gastrinomas are the most common entities. In contrast, vasoactive intetinale peptide (VIP)-secreting tumours, glucagonomas, serotonin-secreting carcinoid tumors, and tumours with secretion of ectopic hormones, such as calcitonin, are extremely rare. Once diagnosis has been established on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings, localization of the source of pathologic hormone secretion is warranted. Imaging methods frequently used for localization of PNET comprise anatomical imaging modalities, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasound, selective arterial catheterization with hepatic venous sampling, DTPA-octreotid scintigraphy and DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotid positron emission tomography.

CD009944,0,21656305,0,[Neuroendocrine tumors of the duodenum and pancreas. Surgical strategy].,"The incidence of neuroendocrine tumors (NET) has increased worldwide by 3-5 times over the last decades. This is mainly based on the broad use of imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic approaches. As a consequence many duodenal and pancreatic tumors are detected in an early stage resulting in an improved prognosis of these patients. Besides the measurement of serum chromogranin A and 5-hydroxy indolic acid measured in 24 h urine collection, CT, endosonographic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopy are important diagnostic tools. About 20% of all patients with pancreatic and duodenal NETs are diagnosed because of specific symptoms. More than 95% of diagnosed NETs are sporadic tumors. Whenever possible these patients should be treated by resection. Benign neuroendocrine duodenal tumors up to 1 cm in size can be removed endoscopically. The endoscopic resection of larger tumors should be performed surgically. The therapy of hereditary NETs of the duodenum and the pancreas should be decided after interdisciplinary discussion. However, even these patients seem to benefit from resection. In case of metastatic disease debulking surgery should be considered if more than 90% of the tumor mass can be resected. In patients with extensive liver metastases but resectable primary NET, liver transplantation is a reasonable option. There is no consensus about adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment of duodenal or pancreatic NETs. The therapy with everolimus or sunitinib in advanced tumor stages has shown promising results. The administration of somatostatin analogues or antacids is appropriate for symptom reduction."

The results show that imunostaining ability of NIR QDs probes is stronger than that of visible QDs when the two kinds of QDs are simultaneously used to probe the cancer biomarkers such as cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in gastric cancer tissues. Moreover, when the two QDs probes are used for immunostaining successively for the same target molecules, staining order has great influences on the final results due to their different conjugating ability to the marker proteins. The results imply that NIR QDs hold more promise for real-time imaging of tumor tissues due to its higher sensitivity and contrast.

A retrospective analysis of all patients treated with chemoradiotherapy between February 2000 and December 2008 at a single tertiary center was performed with documentation of treatment given, toxicities recorded, and follow-up and outcome data. Sixty-two patients received chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer. There were 20 males and 42 female patients with an average age of 68 years. Histology revealed adenocarcinoma in 28 patients and squamous cell carcinoma in 34 patients. All patients were staged with a computerized tomography scan, endoscopic ultrasound and positron emission tomography scan. Selection criteria for chemoradiotherapy were unfit for surgery, upper esophageal squamous carcinoma, unresectable primary tumor, or patient choice. The majority of the patients received a combination of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy with 55 Gy in 25 fractions of radiotherapy. Grade 3 toxicities were recorded in 11% of the patients. Eleven patients suffered from local recurrence and a stent was required in nine patients. Radiation strictures occurred in 10 patients requiring dilation in four. Five patients required a radiologically inserted feeding gastrostomy. The median overall survival was 21 months. Patients with adenocarcinomas and those with squamous cell carcinoma had a similar median survival. Overall survival was 70% at 1 year, 48% at 2 years, and 26% at 3 years. This case series of patients treated with chemoradiation for localized esophageal cancer suggest a generally well-tolerated treatment with survival rates after chemoradiotherapy comparable with those seen with surgery."

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of EUS in determining the depth of penetration (T stage) and nodal status (N stage) in patients with esophageal cancer who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). A retrospective analysis of all patients at a university hospital who underwent preoperative EUS followed by MIE for cancer was performed. We compared the results of preoperative EUS to final pathologic analyses of the esophageal specimen, examining the accuracy of EUS staging. Ninety-five patients with esophageal cancer who underwent MIE had preoperative EUS. Twenty-four of the 95 patients were excluded for lack of a repeat EUS after neoadjuvant therapy before resection. Hence, 71 patients were evaluated for the accuracy of EUS staging. The accuracy of EUS for T0 disease was 80 per cent; T1 disease was 75 per cent; T2 disease was 39 per cent; and T3 disease was 88 per cent. The overall EUS accuracy for T stage was 72 per cent with overstaging occurring mostly for pathologic T1 tumors in 18 per cent and understaging occurring mostly for pathologic T3 tumors in 11 per cent. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of nodal involvement were 79 per cent and 74 per cent, respectively. However the accuracy for T and N staging by EUS after neoadjuvant therapy decreased to 63 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively. Endoscopic ultrasound in the absence of neoadjuvant therapy is a relatively accurate and sensitive modality for determining the depth of tumor penetration and the presence of nodal disease in patients with esophageal carcinoma.

The rapid-acquisition fiber-optic Raman endoscopy system developed was employed for in vivo gastric tissue Raman measurements at 785 nm laser excitation. A total of 1063 in vivo Raman spectra were acquired from 238 tissue sites of 67 gastric patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasound staging procedure, in which 934 Raman spectra were from 121 normal tissue sites whereas 129 Raman spectra were from 117 neoplastic gastric tissue sites. Gastric Raman spectra were fitted and reconstructed by using a linear combination of the eight basis reference spectra from the biochemicals (i.e., actin, albumin, collagen, DNA, histones, pepsinogen, phospholipids and triolein) in gastric tissue and also compared with the in vivo gastric Raman spectra measured. The resulting fit coefficients were further utilized through recursive partitioning techniques to develop diagnostic algorithms for gastric cancer diagnosis. High-quality in vivo Raman spectra in the range of 800-1800 cm(-1) can be acquired from gastric mucosa within 0.5s. The fit coefficients from albumin, nucleic acid, phospholipids and histones were found to be the most significant features for construction of the diagnostic model, giving rise to an overall accuracy of 93.7% (i.e., sensitivity of 94.0% (110/117) and specificity of 93.4% (113/121)) for in vivo discrimination of cancerous tissue from normal gastric tissue after the leave-one tissue site-out, cross-validation technique.

CD009944,0,20676872,0,Clinical staging of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction.,"Tumors of the esophagogastric junction are among the most frequent and cause lethal cancers. Patients often do not present until late in the disease when the tumor is sufficiently large to cause obstruction or invasion of the adjacent structures, and thus becomes symptomatic. Preoperative staging is critical to select those patients whose disease is still locally confined for curative surgery. Ideally, clinical staging should accurately predict tumor invasion, lymph node involvement, and distant metastases. Upper endoscopy establishes the tumor diagnosis by multiple biopsies and defines the tumor type (Siewert I-III), based on tumor localization in relation to the endoscopic cardia. Preoperative TNM staging has a strong impact on treatment strategy. Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) determines the T category, and to a lesser extent, the presence of lymph node metastases. Multislice Computed Tomography (CT) and 18Fluorode-ocx-glucose Positron Emission Computed Tomography (18FDG-PET-CT) provide further information, especially about systemic metastases. Diagnostic laparascopy is suggested in advanced (CT3/4) Siewert type II-III tumors to exclude peritoneal carcinomatosis.

CD009944,0,20669078,0,"Neuroendocrine tumors of the stomach (gastric carcinoids) are on the rise: small tumors, small problems?","Well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the stomach (gastric carcinoid tumors) are observed more often, with a tenfold increase in the US in the last 30 - 35 years, and the prognosis has improved greatly in that time. Nowadays most carcinoids of the stomach are diagnosed at an early stage. Four types of gastric NETs have been proposed and recognition of the type is important for defining the diagnostic approach and treatment. Often gastric NETs (especially type 1) are found incidentally during a gastroscopy performed for other reasons; most of these NETs are smaller than 20 mm in size. Conservative management and endoscopic surveillance is adequate for well differentiated, multifocal gastric carcinoids (type 1 or type 2 gastric NETs) that are less than 10 - 20 mm in diameter, unless they show angioinvasion, infiltrate the muscular wall, or have a proliferation rate above 2 %. Endoscopic ultrasound is the method of choice to determine tumor size and depth of infiltration. It is essential to distinguish between multifocal (types 1 and 2) and unifocal type 3 or type 4 gastric NETs, since surgery is indicated for type 3 gastric NETs larger than 10 mm in diameter and for poorly differentiated (localized) neuroendocrine gastric carcinomas (type 4 gastric NET). For optimal management, the type, biology, and stage of the tumor as well as the individual situation of the patient must be considered.

CD009944,0,20547601,0,Endoscopic ultrasound: a review of current diagnostic and therapeutic applications.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become important in a variety of clinical settings. Echoendoscopes may be categorised into radial and linear configurations. Radial devices are used for diagnostic imaging, whereas linear echoendoscopes also facilitate image guided tissue sampling and intervention. EUS is an established primary diagnostic tool for a number of conditions including choledocholithiasis and biliary microlithiasis. It is therefore well suited to the investigation of the aetiology of pancreatitis where simpler measures fail to identify the aetiology. It can also be used to identify chronic non-calcific pancreatitis. EUS is important in the secondary evaluation of abnormalities detected by other imaging modalities-for example, cystic pancreatic lesions. The high resolution of EUS allows more detailed image based analysis than other imaging modalities. The ability to sample cyst fluid significantly increases the accuracy of lesion characterisation. Most importantly, EUS has become indispensable in the staging of a variety of upper gastrointestinal tract tumours. If resection is being considered, the high resolution images obtained via EUS are invaluable for local tumour staging. EUS guided tissue sampling permits accurate nodal staging without relying on lymph node size as proxy for malignant infiltration. In patients with contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging, EUS is an alternative for the staging of rectal carcinoma. It is used in the staging of lung cancer, often in combination with endobronchial ultrasound. Finally, EUS is used therapeutically in image guided drainage (such as gastrocystostomy in pancreatic pseudocyst) and coeliac plexus neurolysis in patients with abdominal pain caused by pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis."

Surgical excision provides the best approach to treatment but many patients may have small lesions that are difficult to detect, or present with wide spread disease by the time of diagnosis. In addition to clinical assessment and biochemical tests, imaging is a major factor in establishing the diagnosis. Cross-sectional imaging such as US, CT and MR, play a major role in the initial assessment. However, they may miss small lesions or metastatic spread. Functional Imaging became possible with the development of somatostatin receptor imaging using 111In-octreotide, which when combined with anatomical imaging could provide enhanced detection. A major improvement has been achieved by combining receptor and PET inaging through the use of 68Ga-DOTA complexes that have been shown to have a much better sensitivity than other imaging modalities and can provide the basis for radionuclide treatment with 90Y or 177Lu labelled with DOTA complexes."

EUS has, therefore, to be integrated into the standard staging procedure of gastric lymphoma, although its impact on initial treatment decisions might be limited in the individual case. A benefit from the use of miniechoendoscopes, EUS elastography and EUS-guided biopsies has not yet been proven in gastric lymphoma. EUS also confers an important prognostic value regarding treatment responses to Helicobacter pylori eradication. On the contrary, EUS cannot be recommended as a regular part of follow-up investigations considering its limited value in predicting the response of the lymphoma to radiation or chemotherapy."
CD009944,0,20206103,0,Diagnosis and staging in gastrointestinal lymphoma.,"The diagnosis gastrointestinal lymphoma can be made on endoscopic biopsies in the vast majority of cases. Definitive subtyping of the lymphoma according to the WHO classification with the use of additional immunological and molecular markers is the cornerstone for further decision making. Several lymphomas may occur multifocally or show both small cell and large cell components. Therefore, a second endoscopy with an extensive biopsy protocol (mapping) may be mandatory. Staging procedures are required for therapeutic decision making and should include CT-scan, laboratory studies and bone marrow examination as required in other lymphomas. Additional studies must be performed depending subtype and localisation of the lymphoma. In gastric lymphoma endosonography reveals prognostic information. In marginal zone lymphoma of MALT-type attention to other MALT-sites and autoimmune diseases is necessary. In enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma screening for coeliac disease and enteroscopy are required. In several lymphomas (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma) a PET-scan is considered as standard of care. The value of staging procedures after treatment is less well defined. At least in gastric lymphomas, histology is the gold standard after treatment and during follow-up."

Patients with histiocytic sarcoma usually have a poor prognosis due to its aggressive clinical behavior. Here we report a rare case of extranodal histiocytic sarcoma of the stomach which was confirmed through immunohistochemical staining. A 71-year- old man was presented with epigastric pain. Gastroscopy, abdominal CT, and EUS revealed a mass located on the posterior wall of upper body and fundus of the stomach. Grossly, grayish white solid masses were seen extending down to the submucosal layer. Microscopically, the tumor cells had eosinophilic cytoplasm, abundant vacuole, and mitosis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the tumor cells were positive for LCA, CD68, and lysozyme. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of this rare neoplasm is important because it can make a great difference in prognostic outcomes. To make an accurate and definitive diagnosis, immunohistochemical staining is essential in the confirmation of histiocytic origin."

The neoplasm is encountered in every segment of gastrointestinal tract with the gastric localization being the most frequent and simultaneous or successive affection of different digestive sites rarely reported. Symptoms often associated with LP of the stomach include pain and lump in the epigastrium, weight loss, anorexia, dysphagia, nausea and vomiting. Diagnosis of LP-type adenocarcinomas of the stomach has traditionally been achieved by brush cytology and mucosal biopsy. Nevertheless, these techniques may yield false negative results due to potential submucosal location of the lesion. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) contributes to the detection of abundant, independent malignant cells indicative of an anaplastic neoplasm. The characteristic histopathological feature of this entity is cellular spread to the submucosa and stroma with minimal mucosal alterations accompanied by an excessive desmoplastic reaction. Despite recent research on alternative therapies, surgical resection appears the only potentially curative approach. The aim of this review was to evaluate the results of current diagnostic modalities and surgical interventions for LP with special reference to the extent of its histological dissemination and to present the recent literature in order to provide an update on the contemporary concepts of therapeutic management of the disease."
CD009944,0,20214235,0,Mini-laparotomy with abdominal wall lifting for partial gastrectomy in patients with early gastric mucosal cancer at lesser curvature of the middle stomach.,"Partial gastrectomy (PG) is the most frequently adopted minimally invasive procedure for early gastric cancer (EGC), especially mucosal cancer (MC). The aim of this study was to introduce a minimally invasive procedure, i.e., minilaparotomy with abdominal wall lifting for PG in patients with early mucosal gastric cancer at the lesser curvature of the middle stomach. Well differentiated adenocarcionoma in MC at the lesser curvature of the middle stomach was selected, where no lymph node metastasis (NO) was confirmed using ultrasonic endoscopy, CT, and MRI during the preoperative examinations. PG was also chosen for patients with a tumor size of 2cm or less and non-depressive type in whom endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal resection (ESD) was not possible. Five MC patients (3 men and 2 women, aged 44-62 years, mean age 53.3 years) underwent mini-laparotomy with abdominal wall lifting for PG. Our procedure involved a 6 cm upper abdominal median incision made at the beginning of the operation. The upper abdominal wall was lifted by a subcutaneous Kirshner wire. The small wound was also pulled upward and/or laterally by Kent retractors and conventional surgical instruments were used through the wound. The middle stomach could be detected through the small wound and partially resected, approximately 1 cm from the tumor edge under the guide of the endoscope. The resected stomach margin was stitched layer-to-layer. In this way, PG was easily completed. The total surgical time was 71.8 +/- 12.9 min and the mean estimated blood loss was 30.8 +/- 20.5 ml. Day of starting diet was 3 +/- 0.7 days after operation. Post-operative hospitalization was 8.2 +/- 1.3 days. There was no surgical mortality. All subjects were satisfied with this procedure. Mini-laparotomy with abdominal wall lifting is a safe and efficient technique in the treatment of PG for MC with NO at the lesser curvature of the middle stomach when EMR or ESD is impossible."

CD009944,0,20076819,0,Staging laparoscopy in digestive cancers.,"BACKGROUND. Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography may assist in the more accurate staging of digestive cancers. We assessed the diagnostic value of staging laparoscopy in patients with cancers of lower esophagus, stomach, liver, biliary tract, pancreas and colon. MATERIAL AND METHOD. Extended staging laparoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasonography and peritoneal cytology were performed in 165 patients with primary digestive cancers, admitted between January 2006 and December 2008 at three tertiary referral hospitals participating in the study. Staging laparoscopy was immediately followed by open surgery in 63 patients without distant metastases or with uncertain primary tumor resectability, and in 20 colorectal cancer patients with resectable hepatic metastases. The sensibility, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of staging laparoscopy for distant metastases and tumor resectability were assessed against the findings on open surgery and the final pathological report. RESULTS. An unnecessary laparotomy was avoided in 36 of the 99 patients (36.4%) without distant metastases on imaging pre-therapeutic staging. The staging laparoscopy sensitivity for distant metastases varied between 66% and 100% and the diagnostic accuracy between 87% for the lower esophageal cancer and 100% for the biliary tract tumors. The overall morbidity of staging laparoscopy was 2.5% and the mortality 0. CONCLUSION. Staging laparoscopy avoids unnecessary laparotomies and changes the therapeutic plan in a significant number of patients. It can be performed just before the planned surgery or as a separate diagnostic procedure. The laparoscopy indications in digestive cancers are changing fast, with ongoing new developments in cancer treatment and laparoscopic technology."

The patient was a 60-year-old woman in whom esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a submucosal tumor, about 25 mm in size, in the upper body of the stomach, with ulceration at the top of the tumor. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a well-defined hypoechoic mass located in the proper muscle layer of the stomach. The specimen taken from the tumor showed only inflammatory degenerative tissue. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a tumor in the upper body of the stomach. FDG-PET showed FDG uptake (standardized uptake value [SUV] max 5.8) coincident with the tumor. Hence, the tumor was diagnosed initially as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the stomach. Laparoscopic partial gastrectomy was performed. Pathological examination showed that the tumor consisted of spindle cells with large nuclei, and mitosis was absent. The Ki-67 labeling index of the tumor cells was 4%. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed a positive reaction for S-100 protein, whereas they were negative for KIT, CD 34, and alpha-smooth muscle actin protein. The tumor was diagnosed as a benign gastric schwannoma. Gastric schwannoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of submucosal tumors of the stomach with FDG uptake."

Even without accurate diagnosis before treatment, open or laparoscopic surgery is currently carried out to remove SMT. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in diagnostic treatment for submucosal tumor (SMT) of the stomach. Subjects in this case study comprised nine patients who had undergone ESD for gastric SMT. Before treatment, endoscopic ultrasonography was carried out in all cases to evaluate depth and origin of the SMT. Then ESD was only indicated for tumors of submucosal layer or muscularis mucosa origin. Using an endoscopic sub-tumoral dissection technique with a hook knife and a flex knife, local complete resections were achieved in all patients without severe complications. These results suggest the clinical benefits of ESD avoiding oversurgery for the diagnostic treatment of gastric SMT of the submucosal layer and muscularis mucosa origin."

CD009944,0,19942829,0,Endoscopic evaluation and treatment of esophageal cance.,"Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer mortality. During the past twenty years the prevalence of adenocarcinoma, which is linked to gastroesophageal reflux and Barrett's metaplasia, has increased precipitously for unclear reasons. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has revolutionized primary tumor (T) and nodal (N) staging. Additionally, the recent introduction of combined computed and positron emission tomography (CT-PET) promises to improve the detection of distant metastasis. While classic surgical approaches have significant morbidity and mortality, the recent widespread introduction of minimally invasive techniques including endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation offer new options to those with limited disease. Finally, endoscopically placed self expandable metal stents have become the primary mode of palliating dysphagia and there is a growing interest in the use of removable stents to optimize nutrition in neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients awaiting esophagectomy. In this article we will review the presentation, staging, and treatment of esophageal cancer with an emphasis on the evolving role of endoscopy to help accomplish these objectives."
CD009944,0,19902288,0,[Therapy in gastric cancer.

The absolute benefit in overall survival was 13% and 14% after 5 years. This benefit is clearly shown for patients with locally advanced tumors but remains debatable in early disease stages. Postoperative mortality and the complication rate were not increased. Based on published study results perioperative chemotherapy has to be regarded as the new standard of care at least for patients staged as uT3/uT4 tumors as defined by endoscopic ultrasound. To date there are no indications for adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation after R0 resection and adequate surgery.

CD009944,0,19788616,0,Diagnostic findings of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology for gastrointestinal stromal tumors: proposal of a combined cytology with newly defined features and histology diagnosis.,"Recently, endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has been applied for diagnosis of gastrointestinal submucosal tumors. There have been no definite criteria, however, for the adequate cytological diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in practice. To facilitate this a novel method is proposed that combines cytology and histology. For 49 cases of submucosal tumor of gastrointestinal tract, EUS-FNA was performed. The aspirated materials were processed for cytology and histology. Both cytological and histological findings were examined on immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical staining of c-kit. Of 49 cases, 40 (81.6%) proved adequate for cytological and/or histological examination. On cytology, cluster types were classified into type A (piled clusters with high cellularity showing a fascicular pattern), type B (thin layered clusters with high cellularity showing a fascicular pattern), and type C (mono-layered clusters or scattered cells). Types A and B were strongly associated with histological diagnosis of GIST. Type C clusters needed confirmation on c-kit positivity and histology. Thus, the combined cytology with newly defined features, and classification and histological diagnostic method for EUS-FNA materials can contribute to improved routine diagnosis for GIST."
CD009944,0,19744639,0,Contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound and elastosonoendoscopy.,"Until recently, there was no contrast harmonic imaging technique available for EUS examination. Second-generation US contrast agents produce harmonic signals at lower acoustic powers and, therefore, are suitable for EUS imaging at low acoustic powers. CE-EUS could provide a contribution to the differential diagnosis between a primary pancreatic carcinoma, chronic pancreatitis and a pancreatic metastasis, and therefore can have a decisive influence on the selection of appropriate therapeutic strategies (follow-up, chemotherapy or surgery, for example). However, histology remains the standard in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumours. Regarding lymph nodes, CE-EUS cannot replace EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration. Elastography examines the elastic properties of tissues by applying a slight compression to the tissue and comparing an image obtained before and after this compression. EUS elastography is a new application in the field of endosonography and seems to be able to differentiate fibrous and benign tissue from malignant lesions. While our results are very encouraging, further research will be needed to further define the place of this new technique and should be aimed at further defining criteria for accurate elastography as well as subsequently assessing the technique using multiple operators in a blinded setting. EUS-guided sonoelastography has the potential for further guiding the diagnosis and therapy of gastrointestinal-related tumours."
CD009944,0,19744633,0,The role of endosonography in submucosal tumours.,"Submucosal tumours (SMTs) are relatively common findings in patients undergoing endoscopy, especially in upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This term includes various non-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the best imaging procedure to characterise SMT and to determine the need for further explorations. In this review, the following issues will be addressed: the endosonographic features of SMT; the diagnostic accuracy of EUS; the ability of EUS to distinguish benign and malignant SMTs; the value of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA); and the influence of EUS on clinical management."
CD009944,0,19744632,0,The impact of EUS in primary gastric lymphoma.,"Gastric lymphoma is the most frequent site of gastrointestinal lymphoma and is accessible for endosonographic evaluation. Most primary gastric lymphomas are classified as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphomas that develop in the course of chronic Helicobacter pylori infection. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is regarded to be the most accurate method for the local staging of gastric lymphoma, although scientific evidence is limited. In stage uEI1 low-grade lymphoma, EUS is able to predict a high chance for cure by H. pylori eradication. The significance of EUS elastography or EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy to diagnose nodal involvement has not been investigated in prospective series yet. Since high-grade lymphoma is always treated as a systemic disease, the impact of endosonographic staging is lower than in low-grade lymphoma. After treatment of primary gastric lymphoma, EUS produces conflicting results that are not as accurate as endoscopy with biopsy. Therefore, EUS is not mandatory during follow-up."
CD009944,0,19744631,0,Endosonographic staging of lower intestinal malignancy.,"The use of EUS in the assessment of rectal pathology is well established. The accurate staging of lower intestinal tumours predicts prognosis and guides the planning of individual patient treatment. Increased experience and the development of high resolution three-dimensional EUS has lead to the greater accuracy of rectal staging with EUS of rectal tumours now considered the gold standard showing T stage accuracy that ranges from 75% to 95%, with N stage accuracy ranging from 65% to 80%. The use of EUS in the staging of colonic pathology, however, is not so well established though advances in miniprobe EUS has improved the assessment of colonic tumours. EUS is also of benefit in the assessment of anal pathology though here, accurate correlation with histology has not been firmly established."
CD009944,0,19744630,0,Endosonographic staging of upper intestinal malignancy.,"Numerous studies conducted over the last 25 years provide evidence on the high diagnostic accuracy and important role of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in staging oesophageal and gastric carcinoma. This extensive research was recently subjected to metaanalyses, condensing our knowledge on EUS performance and facilitating its comparison with competing methods. It is, however, important to realise that the management of oesophageal and gastric carcinoma is evolving and so are staging algorithms, setting new challenges for EUS and re-defining its position. Restaging after neoadjuvant treatment and precise assessment of early carcinoma before endoscopic treatment are areas of growing interest, but the role of EUS in these settings is rather limited. Rapidly developing cross-sectional imaging has the potential to challenge the position of EUS as the most accurate method in loco-regional staging. On the other hand, EUS guided fine-needle aspiration offers the unique opportunity to obtain cytological confirmation of lymph node metastases, with future potential for molecular staging."
CD009944,0,19744629,0,Endosonography of high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia/early cancer.,"Endosonography (EUS) is frequently used for staging of early malignant gastrointestinal lesions. High-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and mucosal cancer have a very low risk for lymphatic metastasis and therefore are suitable for endoscopic therapy. In HGIN and early oesophageal and gastric cancer, high-frequency miniprobes can provide detailed imaging of the different layers. However, diagnostic accuracy differentiating between mucosal and submucosal disease is not sufficient, and therefore (diagnostic) endoscopic resection should be performed in all localisable lesions to detect submucosal cancer at risk for lymph node metastasis. EUS for lymph node staging is considered to be the method with the highest accuracy, especially compared with computed tomography."

The presence of and associated invasive malignancy exposes the patient to the risk of lymph node metastasis and its devastating effect on survival, regardless of treatment. The authors recommend that patients diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus and highgrade dysplasia be evaluated by an esophageal surgeon, who will be able to confirm the diagnosis and review the surgical options along with their potential benefits and risks. By continuously refining minimally invasive surgical techniques and perioperative care, esophageal resection should remain an acceptable option to patients with this disease."

This phase II study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of administering preoperative epirubicin/cisplatin/capecitabine (ECX). Patients with stage II or III oesophageal/gastro-oesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma from one institution received 4 cycles of ECX (epirubicin 50 mg m(-2) day 1, cisplatin 60 mg m(-2) day 1, capecitabine 625 mg m(-2) b.i.d. daily) followed by surgery. The primary end point was the pathological complete response (pCR) rate based on a Simon two-stage design. Secondary end points included overall and progression-free survival (OS/PFS). Thirty-four patients were recruited: median age 60 years (range 41-81), 91% male, 97% PS 0/1, 80% T3, 68% N1. Thirty-one patients completed four ECX cycles. Grade 3/4 toxicities >or=5% included neutropenia (62%), hand-foot syndrome (15%) and nausea/vomiting (9%). Thirteen out of 28 (46%) evaluable patients responded to chemotherapy by EUS (>or=30% reduction in maximal tumour thickness). Twenty-six out of 34 (76%) patients underwent resection (R0=73%, R1=27%). Post-operatively, two patients died within 60 days of surgery. The pCR rate was 5.9% (95% CI 0-14%) in the intent-to-treat population. According to the statistical design, this prompted early study termination. However, with a median follow-up of 34 months the median OS and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 17 months, 67 and 39% respectively. Median PFS was 13 months. Of the 14 relapsed patients, 10 presented with distant metastases. Preoperative ECX is feasible and well tolerated. Although associated with a low pCR rate, survival with ECX was comparable with published studies suggesting that pCR may not correlate with satisfactory outcome from preoperative chemotherapy for localised oesophageal adenocarcinoma."

CD009944,0,19191855,0,International survey on esophageal cancer: part II staging and neoadjuvant therapy.,"The outcome of esophagectomy could be improved by optimal diagnostic strategies leading to adequate preoperative patient selection. Neoadjuvant therapy could improve outcome by increasing the number of radical resections and by controlling metastatic disease. The purposes of this study were to gain insight into the current worldwide practice of staging modalities and neoadjuvant therapy in esophageal cancer, and to detect intercontinental differences. Surgeons with particular interest in esophageal surgery, including members of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus, the European Society of Esophagology - Group d'Etude Européen des Maladies de l'Oesophage, and the OESO, were invited to participate in an online questionnaire. Questions were asked regarding staging modalities, neoadjuvant therapy, and response evaluation applied in esophageal cancer patients. Of 567 invited surgeons, 269 participated resulting in a response rate of 47%. The responders currently performing esophagectomies (n= 250; 44%) represented 41 countries across the six continents. Esophagogastroscopy with biopsy and computed tomography (CT) scanning were routinely performed by 98% of responders for diagnosing and staging esophageal cancer, while endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and barium esophagography were routinely applied by 58% and 51%, respectively. Neoadjuvant therapy is routinely administered by 33% and occasionally by 63% of responders. Of the responders that administer identical neoadjuvant regimens to esophageal adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma, 54% favor chemoradiotherapy. For AC, chemotherapy is preferred by 31% of the responders that administer neoadjuvant therapy, whereas for squamous cell carcinoma, the majority of responders (38%) prefer chemoradiotherapy. Response to neoadjuvant therapy is predominantly assessed by CT scanning of the chest and abdomen (86%). Barium esophagography, EUS, and combined CT/PET scan are requested for response monitoring in equal frequency (25%). Substantial differences in applied staging modalities and neoadjuvant regimens were detected between surgeons from different continents. In conclusion, currently the most commonly applied diagnostic modalities for staging and restaging esophageal cancer are CT scanning of the chest and abdomen, gastroscopy, barium esophagography and EUS. Neoadjuvant therapy is routinely applied by one third of the responders. Intercontinental differences have been detected in the diagnostic modalities applied in esophageal cancer staging and in the administration of neoadjuvant therapy. The results of this survey provide baseline data for future research and for the development of international guidelines."

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are undoubtedly the commonest malignant SMTs of the stomach, and therefore the attitude towards the general diagnostic approach for GISTs defines the extended diagnostic plan for SMTs. Two recent consensus meetings were assembled concerning the classification and therapeutic plans for GISTs. These meetings shed light upon the need for the modification of the current role of imaging modalities, including endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and computed tomography (CT). According to the revised concepts of GISTs, the most important and plausible current role of imaging for the diagnostic approach of gastric SMTs is to differentiate GISTs from other gastric SMTs. This review discusses the newly established diagnostic role of radiology according to the revised classification of GISTs and provides the differential diagnoses based on EUS and CT findings."
CD009944,0,19021684,0,Adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus with Barrett's esophagus or without Barrett's esophagus: differences in patients' survival after preoperative chemoradiation.,"It remains unclear whether the overall survival (OS) of patients with localized esophageal adenocarcinoma (LEA) with Barrett's esophagus (BE) (Barrett's-positive) and those with LEA without BE (Barrett's-negative) following preoperative chemoradiation is different. Based on the published differences in the molecular biology of the two entities, we hypothesized that the two groups will have a different clinical biology (and OS). In this retrospective analysis, all patients with LEA had surgery following preoperative chemoradiation. Apart from age, gender, baseline clinical stage, location, class of cytotoxics, post-therapy stage, and OS, LEAs were divided up into Barrett's-positive and Barrett's-negative groups based on histologic documentation of BE. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analytic methods were used. We analyzed 362 patients with LEA (137 Barrett's-positive and 225 Barrett's-negative). A higher proportion of Barrett's-positive patients had (EUS)T2 cancers (27%) than those with Barrett's-negative cancer (17%). More Barrett's-negative LEAs involved gastroesophageal junction than Barrett's-positive ones (P = 0.001). The OS was significantly shorter for Barrett's-positive patients than that for Barrett's-negative patients (32 months vs. 51 months; P = 0.04). In a multivariate analysis for OS, Barrett's-positive LEA (P = 0.006), old age (P = 0.016), baseline positive nodes (P = 0.005), more than 2 positive (yp)N (P = 0.0001), higher (yp)T (P = 0.003), and the use of a taxane (0.04) were the independent prognosticators. Our data demonstrate that the clinical biology (reflected in OS) is less favorable for patients with Barrett's-positive LEA than for patients with Barrett's-negative LEA. Our intriguing findings need confirmation followed by in-depth molecular study to explain these differences."

Meta-analysis and systematic review.,"Published data on accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in differentiating T stages of rectal cancers is varied. Study selection criteria were to select only EUS studies confirmed with results of surgical pathology. Articles were searched in Medline and Pubmed. Pooling was conducted by both fixed and random effects models. Initial search identified 3,630 reference articles, of which 42 studies (N = 5,039) met the inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of EUS to determine T1 stage was 87.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 85.3-90.0%] and 98.3% (95% CI 97.8-98.7%), respectively. For T2 stage, EUS had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 80.5% (95% CI 77.9-82.9%) and 95.6% (95% CI 94.9-96.3%), respectively. To stage T3 stage, EUS had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 96.4% (95% CI 95.4-97.2%) and 90.6% (95% CI 89.5-91.7%), respectively. In determining the T4 stage, EUS had a pooled sensitivity of 95.4% (95% CI 92.4-97.5%) and specificity of 98.3% (95% CI 97.8-98.7%). The p value for chi-squared heterogeneity for all the pooled accuracy estimates was > 0.10. We conclude that, as a result of the demonstrated sensitivity and specificity, EUS should be the investigation of choice to T stage rectal cancers. The sensitivity of EUS is higher for advanced disease than for early disease. EUS should be strongly considered for T staging of rectal cancers."

The peak age for harboring GIST of the stomach is around 60 years and a slight male preponderance is reported. These tumors are identified by expression of CD117 or CD34 antigen. Symptoms at presentation usually include bleeding, abdominal pain or abdominal mass. Endoscopically, they typically appear as a submucosal mass with or without ulceration and on CT scans an extragastric mass is usually seen. Complete surgical resection provides the only chance for cure, with only 1-2 cm free margins needed.

Patients referred to two surgeons in an Australian metropolitan teaching hospital with esophageal or esophago-gastric junction malignancy between May 2002 and December 2006 were included. Patients who had undergone prereferral treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. Patients undergoing resection for gastrointestinal stromal tumors or high-grade dysplasia within Barrett's esophagus were also excluded. Clinical and non-clinical data were recorded prospectively. Pretreatment staging included routine CT scan and selective endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). FDG-PET was performed in patients judged to have curable disease on CT scanning and EUS. From a total of 130 eligible patients, 76 were judged to have curable disease on the basis of CT and EUS findings. Of these 76 patients, 19 (25%) were excluded from surgery due to additional information obtained from FDG-PET. The addition of FDG-PET to routine preoperative staging resulted in the exclusion from surgery of 19 (25%) patients who prior to the introduction of FDG-PET would have undergone attempted resection. FDG-PET should be performed in all patients under consideration for esophagogastric resection in order to avoid resection in patients with disseminated disease."

Gastrointestinal glomus tumors are rare and most frequently occur in the stomach as a subepithelial tumor. A 46-year-old woman presented with an incidental finding of a subepithelial tumor in the stomach. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed a 1.4chi1 cm sized well circumscribed heterogeneous hypoechoic tumor with a few tubular structures in the fourth sonographic layer of the gastric wall. Characteristically, more hypoechoic halo equal to the echogenecity of proper muscle layer enclosed the tumor. Contrast enhanced abdominal computerized tomography (CT) revealed high enhancement of tumor up to the same level of portal vein in arterial phase and this enhancement persisted to portal phase. For histolgogic confirmation and treatment, endoscopic enucleation was attempted but failed due to fibrotic adhesion with the surrounding tissue.

A survey regarding utilization of EUS-FNA in esophageal cancer was distributed to 211 thoracic surgeons and 251 EUS-capable gastroenterologists. Seventy-six thoracic surgeons (36%) and 78 gastroenterologists (31%) responded to the survey. Most surgeons (75%) use EUS to stage potentially resectable esophageal cancer 75% of the time. Surgeons using EUS less often are less likely to have access to high-quality EUS services than their peers. Fewer surgeons believe EUS is the most accurate test for T and N-staging (84% and 71%, respectively) as compared with gastroenterologists (97% and 96%, P < 0.01 for both). Most endosonographers (68%) decide whether to dilate a malignant esophageal stricture to complete the staging exam on a case-by-case basis. Surgeons disagree as to whether involvement of celiac lymph nodes should preclude esophagectomy in distal esophageal cancer. While most thoracic surgeons have embraced EUS-FNA as the most accurate locoregional staging modality in esophageal cancer, this attitude is not fully reflected in utilization patterns due to a lack of quality EUS services in some centers. Controversial areas that warrant further study include dilation of malignant strictures to facilitate EUS staging, and the implication of involved celiac lymph nodes on management."
CD009944,0,18833142,0,[Results of surgical treatment of residual and recurrent anal tumors].,"Radio- or chemotherapy is a modern standard of anal cancer treatment. Recurrence or partial remission rate after radiochemotherapy achieves 20-40%. The study is aimed to evaluate the role of abdominoperineal resection in the treatment of residual and recurrent anal cancer. 120 patients (aged from 30 to 81 (59+/-11) years, men:women ratio--1:9) were prospectively studied in the period of 1995 to 2007. The TNM distribution was as follows: T1-2N0M0--66(55.0%), T3-4N0M0--18(15.0%), T1-2N1-3M0--15(12.5%) and T3-4N1-3M0--21(17.5%) patients. The radiotherapy delivered in a dose range of 55-65 Gy was used alone or in combination with chemotherapy with 5-fluoruracil, mitomycin C or Xeloda. The complete tumor regression after radiotherapy/radiochemotherapy was achieved in 74(61.1%) of 120 patients with cancer-specific survival rate of 81.7%. Partial tumor regression was registered in 46 of 120 patients. The abdominoperineal resection was performed in 39(84.8%) of patients with the residual tumor. Thus, surgical treatment allowed secondary local tumor control in 76.9% of patients with the 5-year survival rates of 69.0%. The median survival time for the non-operated patients, including those, received an extra course of radiotherapy, was 19 months. The locoregional tumor relapse was diagnosed in 10(13.74%) of 74 patients with the complete tumor regression. The use of abdominoperineal resection allowed the secondary local tumor control and 5 year survival. Thus, abdominoperineal resection remains the method of choice in the treatment of residual and recurrent anal tumors."

CD009944,0,18810677,0,[Miniprobe EUS].,"With the advent of flexible, high-frequency catheter probes that can be introduced through the working channel of any endoscope, EUS became available as an additional and very powerful diagnostic tool during routine endoscopic procedures. Miniprobes as a supplement to echoendoscopes with radial or longitudinal scanners provide detailed images with a penetration depth of about 20 mm using frequencies of around 20 MHz. Not only structures of the intestinal wall but also a considerable volume of the surrounding organs can be visualised. In the intestine sonographic coupling is best accomplished using bare miniprobes with water filling of the lumen. Out of 1007 miniprobe examinations carried out in the author's clinic, the most frequent indications involved the distal bile and pancreatic ducts (36 %), carcinoma of the oesophagus or the cardia (18 %), submucosal tumours and GIST (14 %), and others (32 %). For evaluating the distal common bile duct, extraductal EUS (EDUS) allows the visualisation of small pathological lesions, especially intraductal stones without ductal dilatation with a sensitivity of 97 % and a specificity of 98 %. For the staging of early cancers, miniprobe EUS has its significance mainly in showing a preserved submucosal layer, thereby excluding an endoscopically non-resectable T 2 lesion, as was successfully done in all of our cases. Suspicious prominent structures were easily assigned to the correct layer of the wall or identified as external impressions."

Endosonography is not used in the primary detection and diagnosis of gastric cancer, but as a supplementary method that, besides the basic detection of the presence or absence of a tumour, gives additional information about the extent of the neoplasm. For this investigation the patients were divided into 3 groups. The first group of 58 pts (30%) were those with benign gastric lesions, 18 pts with polyps and 40pts with gastric ulcers respectively. The second groups of 64 pts (32.5%) consisted of those with gastric cancer. According to the endosonographic findings this group consisted of 2 subgroups: 45 operable patients and 19 inoperable patients with gastric cancers. The third group consisted of 73 pts (37.5%) who were without any changes in the gastric wall. The endosonographic findings in the first subgroup that underwent surgery were correlated with the final intraoperative stage and pathohistology, and in the second subgroup they were compared with the operative finding during the palliation procedure and the final diagnosis of the additional investigation. All these qualities make this method useful for the diagnosis, control and follow-up of the findings in all of the stadiums of the disease including the post-operative period."

A 61-year-old man who had early gastric cancer associated with GCP underwent a distal gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy. Histological examination showed various histological types of cancer -well differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma- that had developed independently in the mucosal and submucosal layers of the resected specimen. Furthermore, multiple cysts with a single layer of columnar epithelium were present in the submucosa around the cancerous lesions. However, no neoplastic changes were found in those epithelial cells. Helicobacter pylori was detected in the residual stomach 3 months after surgery. Although the mechanism of the relationship between gastric carcinoma and GCPs is obscure, we speculate that repeated erosion and regeneration induced by chronic inflammation causes multicentric carcinogenesis as well as an aberration of the gastric glands. GCPs may be a risk factor for multiple gastric cancer."

Endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor-like lesion with central ulceration. The lesion was the suspected cause of the anemia; therefore, a partial resection of the stomach was performed. The histopathologic examination revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma (MUC). The tumor extended to the submucosa. Accordingly, a subtotal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection was performed. In stomach carcinoma simulating an SMT, generally preoperative diagnosis is important. However, in this patient, surgery was selected as the best treatment."

We evaluated the clinicopathologic features and prognosis including overall survival of NEC of the esophagus. We identified 40 patients with esophageal NEC from our institutional database. All cancers had been clinically staged using endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography. Neuroendocrine differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. The NEC component was classified into small-cell and large-cell subtypes, and non-neuroendocrine components were evaluated. Patients with locoregional disease were treated with chemoradiation with or without surgery or with surgery only. Patients with distant metastasis were treated with systemic therapy. The extent of residual tumors was evaluated in esophagectomy specimens after preoperative chemoradiation. Twenty-seven patients had large-cell NEC, and 13 had small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. An adenocarcinoma component was present in 15 patients and squamous carcinoma component in 1 patient. Synaptophysin was positive in all cases, and chromogranin was positive in 31 cases. Seventeen patients had distant metastasis, and 21 had locoregional disease. Seventeen patients with locoregional disease received preoperative chemoradiation. Disease progressed in 7 patients, and 10 had residual tumor in resection specimens. Overall survival was better with locoregional disease than with distant metastasis (P=0.006). Overall survival was better in patients with non-neuroendocrine component than in patients with pure NEC (P=0.031). There was no difference in prognosis between patients with large-cell NEC and those with small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Esophageal NEC is an aggressive tumor, and patients with mix NEC have better outcome."

Staging currently follows the modified Ann Arbor classification but most likely in the future, the TNM-based Paris staging system will be applied due to its detailed description of the local spread as well as the extraintestinal dissemination. For assessment of gut wall infiltration and local lymphonodular involvement, endoscopic ultrasound currently represents the standard procedure and is an essential diagnostic tool regarding locoregional staging. Additionally, the method confers a high prognostic value regarding treatment response in MALT lymphoma. In endoscopic ultrasound stage EI 1, Helicobacter pylori eradication leads in 70 - 100 % to a complete response. However, the value of endoscopic ultrasound in the follow-up of lymphomas after chemotherapy remains elusive and controversial. There is no clear correlation between histologically proven residual disease and endosonographic results. Thus, so far, endoscopic ultrasound will not replace bioptic surveillance after MALT lymphoma treatment."

The high prognostic and therapeutic relevance of the resulting cytopathological diagnoses necessitates a shared responsibility of endosonographer and cytopathologist. Quality control programs are required. The diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsies depends on the location, size and characteristics of target tissues, and technical factors (i. e., type of needle used, biopsy technique, and material processing). Other weighing factors include training, expertise and interaction of the endosonographer with cytopathologists. On-site cytological evaluation, which has proven to be successful in optimising the diagnostic efficiency of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy, is notably practiced in Northern American and French academic institutions. It seems to be a sensible alternative to collect specimens for histological and immunohistochemical investigations in addition to the cytological smears in consideration of the economic and structural terms in the German health-care system. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration succeeds in harvesting core biopsies in 3 out of 4 cases with 22-gauge needles.

A further decisive criterion for therapy is the lymph node status. Here, endosonography exhibits a high sensitivity albeit with an unsatisfactory specificity. The specificity can be increased by the cytological evaluation of biopsy samples from the fine needle puncture of suspicious lymph nodes, a method with a very low complication rate.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of using the SN technique in treating early gastric cancer and to explore its usefulness for minimal invasive surgery. Twenty-three patients with early gastric cancer who underwent SN biopsy were retrospectively evaluated. Based on SN evaluation, individualized surgery was performed in five patients with T1N0M0 gastric cancer. When pathological examination of frozen sections revealed metastasis in SNs, we performed a standard D2 gastrectomy. Laparoscopic local resection was applied when the SN biopsy was negative. Our results showed that the success rate with SN biopsy in early gastric cancer was 100%, as were the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. All five patients with early gastric cancer had SNs negative for metastases both by frozen section and by postoperative pathology. Thus, all these patients underwent laparoscopic local resection without extended lymphadenectomy. We conclude that SN biopsy is a useful tool to individualize the operative procedure, and laparoscopic local resection can be safely performed using SN guidance in selected patients with early gastric cancer."

Endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor (SMT) , which eroded with a depression on its surface in the fornix. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a heterogeneous tumor in the third layer. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed to resect the tumor completely. The pathological diagnosis was a gastric hamartomatous inverted polyp. The patient was later discharged without any complications. Hamartomatous inverted polyps without a stalk are classified as the SMT type because the tumor is inverted down growth into the submucosal layer, otherwise polyps with a stalk are classified as the polyp type. All of the polyps were resected endoscopically, however, surgical resection was performed for those of the SMT type, because it is difficult to remove this type completely by en-block resection using conventional EMR technique.

Superior loco-regional detail may yield useful staging and prognostic information but information on its accuracy, as compared with computed tomography (CT), remains undefined and limited by small study size. We prospectively studied 109 patients with gastroesophageal cancer; 99 of whom were undergoing surgery. All had EUS and helical CT imaging before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the results were compared with pathological staging of resected specimens. Tumor response was assessed by the reduction in maximal tumor depth at EUS and correlated with patient survival. There was no difference in T and N stage accuracies between EUS and CT following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. manova showed a reduction in maximal tumor depth by > 50% at EUS to be associated with longer survival (relative risk = 0.48, P < 0.05). EUS responders had a median survival of 38 months compared to 30 months for non-responders (P < 0.05). The identification of lymphadenopathy at radial EUS was not predictive of survival. This large series study demonstrates the staging accuracy of CT and non-biopsy EUS in the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for gastroesophageal cancer to be equivalent and poor.

CD009944,0,18084953,0,Surgical palliation of advanced pancreatic cancer.,"In about 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer surgical resection is not feasible at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, palliative treatment plays a key role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The defined goals of palliative treatment are: reduction of symptoms, reduction of in-hospital stays, and an adequate control of pain. In patients with nonresectable pancreatic carcinoma the leading goal of palliative strategies should be the control of biliary and duodenal obstructions such as jaundice-associated pruritus or sustained nausea and vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction. Although the role of endoscopy for palliation has been increasing, operative palliation is still indicated in selected cases. Obstructive jaundice is found in approximately 70% of patients suffering from carcinoma of the pancreatic head at diagnosis and has to be eliminated to avoid progressive liver dysfunction and liver failure. In up to 50% of patients with pancreatic cancer, clinical symptoms such as nausea and vomiting occur. For the treatment of malignant biliary obstructions in patients with pancreatic carcinoma, endoscopic biliary drainage is the option of first choice. In case of persistent stent-problems such as occlusion or recurrent cholangitis, a hepaticojejunostomy should be considered. The role of a prophylactic gastroenterostomy is still under discussion. In patients with combined biliary and gastric obstruction a combined bypass should be performed to avoid a second operation. The significance of laparoscopic biliary bypass is not yet clear. A surgical, minimally invasive approach for treating bile duct obstruction is not the standard nowadays. The role of surgical pain relief is mostly negligible today. Computed tomography (CT)- or EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis has replaced surgical intervention today. The significance of palliative resections is currently a controversial topic. However, beyond controlled randomized studies, a palliative pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma cannot be recommended at this time."

Esophageal cancer is often treated by using a combined modality approach (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and esophagectomy); correct integration of PET/CT into the conventional work-up of esophageal cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines the information from PET/CT with results of clinical assessment, diagnostic CT, endoscopic gastroduodenoscopy, and endoscopic ultrasonography. PET/CT has limited utility in T staging of esophageal cancer and relatively limited utility in detection of dissemination to locoregional lymph nodes. However, PET/CT allows detection of metastatic disease that may not be identifiable with other methods. PET/CT is not sufficiently reliable in the individual patient for determination of treatment response in the primary tumor.

CD009944,0,17985093,0,Localisation and staging of gastrin producing tumours using cross-sectional imaging modalities.,"Cross sectional imaging in the assessment of gastrinomas has three major applications: Tumor localization (sporadic gastrinoma, MEN I) in patients undergoing primary or secondary surgery. Staging of metastasized tumors, especially assessment of lymph nodes and liver metastases, possibly including a risk analysis prior to liver resection. Post-surgery follow-up and monitoring of bio- or chemotherapy. Detection of primary tumors is strongly correlated with their size. However, the sensitivity of surgical assessment of the mostly small tumors by experienced surgeons is much higher than that of any imaging modality. Of all imaging modalities, endoultrasonography (EUS) followed by Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) is the most sensitive modality for the assessment of pancreatic tumors in asymptomatic patients suffering from a MEN-I syndrome. Scintigraphy has the highest sensitivity in tumors of symptomatic patients and in the assessment of metastases. CT and MRI are only second line diagnostic modalities. Their sensitivity is largely dependent on the selection of patients. As a potential application, 3D reconstruction of nearly isotropic CT data sets for the risk assessment prior to liver resection is currently developing. Due to the absent radiation exposure, MRI is increasingly utilized to monitor the response of metastases under systemic therapy, e.g. in clinical trials."

The application of this new treatment requires an accurate stadiation of the neoplasia. The exclusion of nodal involvement and the evaluation of the depth of tumor penetration within the gastrointestinal wall is essential to select patients who can benefit from this approach. Echoendoscopy allows endoscopists to evaluate subtle changes in the layers of the gastrointestinal wall giving an important aid to local tumor staging and planning the adequate treatment.

CD009944,0,17921945,0,Endoscopic ultrasound and staging of non-small cell lung cancer.,"Accurate cancer staging allows the most favorable therapy and prognosis of a neoplastic process, and allows consistency when performing clinical trials for different stages of tumors. In the case of non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most important parameters for optimal treatment and prognosis are the presence of cancer spread to the lymph nodes within the mediastinum, and to distant organs. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become a significant tool for the assessment of mediastinal lymph nodes, and in some cases, distant organ metastases because of its minimally invasive access to these sites through a trans-esophageal or trans-gastric approach. The capability of performing fine needle aspiration (FNA) has greatly improved the accuracy and popularity of EUS for lung cancer staging.

This review will summarize the principles of endoscopic ultrasound T staging using a radial echoendoscope, elaborate on the accuracy rate in T staging, and discuss the clinical impact of endoscopic ultrasound T staging in the context of esophageal, gastric and pancreaticobiliary cancers."
CD009944,0,17921934,0,Endoscopic ultrasound teaching and learning.,"Scientific publications in the field of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are raising up since the last twenty years. The value of EUS is directly proportional to the training, skill and experience of the endosonographer. In a recent series, the lowest annual number of examinations requested per year might be around 200-250 procedures. For achieving competence in all the fields of EUS, they recommended a minimum of 150 supervised cases, 75 of them being devoted to pancreaticobiliary diseases and 50 to fine needle aspiration (FNA). Many studies have yet confirmed the importance of the learning curve to improve the EUS accuracy. The accuracy of EUS staging of esophageal cancer was significantly improved over an 8-year period for T staging from 64% to 90% but not for N staging. Considering pancreaticobiliary diseases, some series reported the influence of training on accuracy of EUS-guided FNA of pancreatic masses. Even if the exact type and modalities for EUS training remained to be determined, the usefulness of a period of training in a center performing more than 200 procedures per year is confirmed. Improving cognitive EUS learning and technique required theoretical teaching and practical teaching with observation during live demonstration and echoendoscope hands-on in humans with an expert supervision or with different simulator models. In France, formal EUS training has been underway since 1991, with a two-year intensive program including 4 weeks of theoretical training and 20 one-day practical sessions per year. This program was updated in 2004 to include 3 weeks of theoretical course work including numerous video sessions and 1 week of practical sessions. Theoretical courses are given primarily by gastroenterologists and EUS experts, but also by pathologists, surgeons, anatomists and radiologists. Practical sessions include 4 days of live demonstrations and computed-based simulator (EUS mentor; Simbionix, Tel Hashomer, Israel) and one day with a swine model. Simulators, either computed-based simulator, Erlangen model, or live pigs are believed to shorten the learning phase of EUS. The live pig model was chosen for EUS credentialing because it appears to be similar in many respects to the human anatomy, especially for the pancreas, portal and mesenteric vessels, celiac axis, left kidney and spleen. In addition, for trainees, it often appears more exciting and stimulating than virtual model. However, EUS training on a swine model is recognized to be the more expansive way for EUS teaching. Between the pre and post-test, EUS fellows significantly improved their competence for the visualization of anatomical structures i.e. vena cava, mesenteric/splenic vein, celiac axis, pancreas and bile duct. At the end of the day-session, trainees were mostly able to recognize and follow these anatomical structures with both endoscopes. Interventional EUS learning was also assessed. A significant decrease in procedural duration and a significant increase in FNA precision were demonstrated for the puncture of a hilar liver lymph node."

We aimed to determine the additional diagnostic value of alternative staging investigations. We included 569 oesophageal or gastric cardia cancer patients who had undergone CT neck/thorax/abdomen, ultrasound (US) abdomen, US neck, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and/or chest X-ray for staging. Sensitivity and specificity were first determined at an organ level (results of investigations, i.e., CT, US abdomen, US neck, EUS, and chest X-ray, per organ), and then at a patient level (results for combinations of investigations), considering that the detection of distant metastases is a contraindication to surgery. For this, we compared three strategies for each organ: CT alone, CT plus another investigation if CT was negative for metastases (one-positive scenario), and CT plus another investigation if CT was positive, but requiring that both were positive for a final positive result (two-positive scenario). In addition, costs, life expectancy and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared between different diagnostic strategies. CT showed sensitivities for detecting metastases in celiac lymph nodes, liver and lung of 69, 73, and 90%, respectively, which was higher than the sensitivities of US abdomen (44% for celiac lymph nodes and 65% for liver metastases), EUS (38% for celiac lymph nodes), and chest X-ray (68% for lung metastases). In contrast, US neck showed a higher sensitivity for the detection of malignant supraclavicular lymph nodes than CT (85 vs 28%). At a patient level, sensitivity for detecting distant metastases was 66% and specificity was 95% if only CT was performed. A higher sensitivity (86%) was achieved when US neck was added to CT (one-positive scenario), at the same specificity (95%). This strategy resulted in lower costs compared to CT only, at an almost similar (quality adjusted) life expectancy. Slightly higher specificities (97-99%) were achieved if liver and/or lung metastases found on CT, were confirmed by US abdomen or chest X-ray, respectively (two-positive scenario). These strategies had only slightly higher QALYs, but substantially higher costs. The combination of CT neck/thorax/abdomen and US neck was most cost-effective for the detection of metastases in patients with oesophageal or gastric cardia cancer, whereas the performance of CT only had a lower sensitivity for metastases detection and higher costs. The role of EUS seems limited, which may be due to the low number of M1b celiac lymph nodes detected in this series. It remains to be determined whether the application of positron emission tomography will further increase sensitivities and specificities of metastases detection without jeopardising costs and QALYs."

CD009944,0,17679360,0,[The possibilities and barriers in endoscopic examination and treatment of esophagus cancer].,"When it comes to the effective treatment of esophagus tumor is one of the most difficult tumor to treat of all tumors of alimentary tract. It is due to the biological features of this tumor and lack of its early clinical symptoms, which would allow to recognize it in the early stage and to begin with a radical treatment. The main method to recognize the esophagous tumor is the endoscopic treatment with histopathology, and the endosonography is the best method which allows to estimate its local advancement. Endoscopy allows to detect pre-malignant phase and the early stage as well use of the alternative to surgical endoscopic methods of the treatment. Unfortunately, endoscopy made to patients with swallow discordance usually shows the advanced esophagus tumor, which is to be qualified for palliative treatment that include: widening of esophagus, different methods of ablation, endoscopic stenting and implementing alimentary gastrostomy. The choice of the treatment method should be based on the type of the tumor and the advancement stage of disease, but the clinical practice shows that the method of treatment is determined by the availability of the methods and experience. The parallel use of different methods of treatment may give better results, but the wide range of treatment methods shows the lack of optimal way of treatment, on the other hand gives the possibility to chose the individual method of optimal treatment. Surgical treatment is still method of choice in the esophagus tumor, but it is often impossible to perform or is appears to be ineffective and it creates the possibility of use of alternative endoscopic methods. The article shows the possibilities of diagnosing and different endoscopic techniques for radical treatment of earlyphase and palliative treatment of advanced tumor of esophagus."

Endoscopic ultrasound cannot accurately distinguish benign from malignant changes in the primary lesion or lymph node on imaging alone. With the introduction of the curved linear array echoendoscope in the 1990s, the indications for EUS have expanded. The curved linear array echoendoscope enables the visualization of a needle as it exits from the biopsy channel in the same plane of ultrasound imaging in real time. This allows the endoscopist to perform a whole range of interventional applications ranging from fine needle aspiration (FNA) of lesions surrounding the gastrointestinal tract to celiac plexus block and drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst.

CD009944,0,17599290,0,[Current status of ultrasound in gastroenterology--bowel and upper gastrointestinal tract--part 1].,"Ultrasonography has become widely accepted as a diagnostic tool for gastrointestinal diseases. It not only assesses the lumen but more importantly also the wall and the surrounding structures of the stomach and bowel. Furthermore, functional processes (peristalsis, blood flow) can be visualised and provide important information for passage and perfusion. Modern high resolution (compressive) sonography represents an ideal complementary method besides endoscopy for the gastroenterologist. It is used in emergency diagnosis in cases of acute appendicitis and peridiverticulitis. Here sonography is the method of first choice achieving a high sensitivity. The same applies to ileus, which can be diagnosed significantly earlier by sonography than with conventional X-ray methods. Meanwhile sonography can contribute considerable information to clarify pathogenesis (e. g., invagination, intususception). The detection of a perforation depends strongly on the competence of the examiner. The main advantage is the detection of a covered perforation and the genesis (e. g., ulcer). Ultrasound is less commonly considered in celiac sprue but important complementary information can be obtained. Advanced tumours of the gastrointestinal tract can easily be visualised, although early stages can hardly be detected by means of sonography. An accurate T-staging of tumours is not possible with transabdominal sonography, not least because some parts of the bowel (colon and rectum) cannot always and completely be seen. Exclusion of tumour or early detection is not possible by ultrasound. In intestinal diseases additional information besides clinical and endoscopic aspects can be achieved by ultrasound. Sonography is important for differential diagnosis and follow-up and spares the patient from more incriminatory endoscopic operations. Ultrasound is equal to other imaging methods in detecting complications (fistulas, abscess, stenosis). Due to the complexity of the topic the following review will concentrate on giving an idea of the present status of sonography in chronic inflammatory bowel disease, some less frequent intestinal infections (bacterial, pseudomembranous, neutropenic colitis, intestinal tuberculosis), the ischaemic bowel diseases as well as diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract."

The pathological examination revealed that the lesion, measuring 45 mm x 35 mm, was an inverted hyperplastic polyp (IHP) located in the submucosal layer and consisting mostly of columnar cells resembling foveolar epithelium and pyloric gland cells. Notably, adenocarcinoma with adjacent dysplasia was observed in the submucosal glands. Transition from hyperplasia to dysplasia and from dysplasia to adenocarcinoma was noted. The adenocarcinoma component was intensely and diffusely positive for p53 overexpression, while the dysplasia component showed only weak and focal positivity, suggesting a role of p53 mutation in the dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. Gastric IHP is very rare, and only 31 cases (in 29 patients) have been reported. Five of these IHPs coexisted with gastric adenocarcinomas, which had all developed separately from the IHP lesions.

Endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a 2-cm submucosal tumor located in the posterior wall of the upper gastric body, showing a heterogeneous hyperechoic tumor. A laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach was performed. Pathological examinations revealed that the tumor was composed of spindle cells like fibroblasts and mature adipocytes. Immunohistochemical examinations revealed that the tumor was negative for desmin and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of fibrolipoma was made. EUS is useful for differentiating a fibrolipoma from a gastrointestinal stromal tumor or lipoma by the findings of characteristic echogenesity and detection of the tumor origin."

CD009944,0,17069596,0,Multiple giant leiomyomas of the esophagus and stomach.,"Leiomyomas are rare esophageal disorders, although among the benign esophageal neoplasms, they are the most common. Multiple leiomyomas are distinguished from esophageal leiomyomatosis, an extremely rare condition, which is associated with Alport syndrome, showing deletions and rearrangements of the COL4A5/COL4A6 gene. There are only a few reports of diffuse multilocular lesions. A 19-year-old man presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and diffuse abdominal pain. On endoscopy multiple nodules covered with intact mucosa were present, the largest tumor arising from the gastro-esophageal border infiltrating the cardia. Barium swallow demonstrated narrowing of the middle and lower esophagus with the upper third of the stomach filled by the tumor. Thorax and abdominal CT scans revealed infiltration of almost the total aboral esophagus by the tumor with compression of left and right bronchi. The infiltration reached the whole lesser curvature of the stomach. Endosonography showed multiple encapsulated nodules. Due to the extended tumor growth with infiltration of the upper third of the stomach, a total esophago-gastrectomy with reconstruction by colon interposition was performed. On histopathological examination multiple esophageal leiomyomas with infiltration of the proximal third of the stomach was shown. Immunohistochemically the tumor stained positive for desmin and sm-actin and negative for CD34 and c-kit. Genetic analysis ruled out a deletion of the COL4A5/COL4A6 locus on chromosome X that is linked with Alport syndrome-diffuse leiomyomatosis. Extended mutations in the COL4A5 gene, associated with Alport syndrome, to the COL4A6 gene, are required for the development of leiomyomatosis. In young patients with diffuse multinodular infiltration by encapsulated tumors, esophageal leiomyomatosis should be considered. If the proximal third of the stomach is infiltrated by the tumor an extended resection is necessary. Reconstruction procedures include colon interposition."
CD009944,0,17069595,1,The multidisciplinary team meeting improves staging accuracy and treatment selection for gastro-esophageal cancer.,"The object of this article is to assess current staging accuracies for individual modalities and to investigate the influence of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) on clinical staging accuracies and treatment selection for patients with gastro-esophageal cancer. Patients newly diagnosed with gastric or esophageal cancer and who were deemed suitable for surgical resection by the MDT were studied. Patients were staged with a combination of computerized tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS). Additionally, the MDT determined an overall clinical stage for each patient after discussion at the MDT meeting. Treatments were selected according to this final clinical stage. Final histopathological staging (pTNM) was available for all patients and was used as the gold standard for determining staging accuracy. Suitability of treatment selection was assessed once final pTNM was available. One hundred and eighteen patients were studied. Endoscopic ultrasound was the most accurate individual staging modality for the loco-regional assessment of esophageal tumors (T stage accuracy 78%, N stage accuracy 70%). Laparoscopic ultrasound was the most accurate modality in T staging of gastric cancers (91%). The MDT stage was more accurate than each individual staging modality for T and N staging for both gastric and esophageal cancers (accuracy range: 88-89%) and was better for the assessment of nodal disease than each individual modality (CT P < 0.001, EUS P < 0.01, LUS P < 0.01). Overall staging accuracy as determined at the MDT meeting was increased and resulted in only 2/118 (2%) patients being under-treated.

CD009944,0,16997159,0,The role of surgery in patients with advanced gastric cancer.,"Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment with curative intent for established gastric cancer. Patient selection is critical to achieving satisfactory outcomes, and involves careful assessment of both patient fitness and disease stage. Staging techniques have multiplied and become much more sensitive in recent years. Current best practice involves a combination of spiral CT scan, Endoscopic ultrasound, PET scanning and laparoscopy. Only a minority of patients progress to potentially curative surgery after staging and fitness assessment in Western centres. Conventional treatment involves a distal subtotal gastrectomy or total gastrectomy depending on the site of the lesion. Innovative techniques include the Merendino operation, and pylorus and nerve sparing gastrectomies for earlier stage disease in the proximal and distal stomach, respectively. There is evidence of nutritional and quality of life benefit in the first 2 years after surgery from formation of a gastric substitute reservoir. Laparoscopic resection is well established in Japan and is developing rapidly elsewhere but its role and outcomes are not yet well defined. Radical lymph node dissection remains controversial: randomised trial evidence of overall benefit is lacking, but expert series have produced excellent results, and there are indications of a sub-group benefit for patients with stage II and III disease. The increased morbidity and mortality associated with radical dissection appear to be largely attributable to pancreatic and splenic resection together with limitations in Unit expertise. Surgical palliation has become less important in recent years as interventional radiology and endoscopy techniques have been developed for the same purposes. Overall mortality and survival results have improved dramatically over the last 20 years, but interpretation of these figures is made difficult by major changes in staging and case selection. The chances of long-term survival are, however, clearly much greater, and those of peri-operative death much less for an individual patient accepted for surgery in 2006 than they would have been in 1986."

If a patient with oesophageal carcinoma is eligible for treatment with curative intent, they should undergo thoracic and abdominal CT, ultrasound investigation of the supraclavicular region and endoscopic ultrasonography for staging purposes. Endoscopic therapy is the preferred treatment for high-grade dysplasia or early cancer in Barrett's oesophagus confined to the mucosa. Surgical resection is indicated if the tumour invades the submucosa. If resection of the oesophageal carcinoma is performed with curative intent, one should aim for radical resection. The type and extent of the resection depends on the location of the tumour. There is evidence that the mortality rate following surgery can be reduced by performing it in centres with ample experience with oesophageal cancer surgery. Preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy may improve survival in patients with oesophageal carcinoma. Palliative treatment for oesophageal carcinoma should be considered in cases of local invasion of surrounding organs, metastases, poor physical condition of the patient or recurrent disease after previous curative treatment.

Therefore, it is necessary to reliably identify patients who might benefit from major surgical intervention by employing the appropriate staging methods. In this review, the pros and cons of each imaging technique are discussed and an algorithm for single and combined use of the different imaging modalities is proposed. To date, contrast-enhanced multi-detector row helical CT (MDR-CT) together with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) remain the first staging methods of choice. MDR-CT has a high sensitivity for identifying vascular invasion and EUS is able to detect lesions as small as 2-3 mm. ERCP is performed mainly in patients with biliary obstruction with the option for therapeutic intervention during the same session. MRI with MR-angiography, MRCP, PET/CT and staging laparoscopy are additional modalities which might give further information in cases of equivocal findings by MDR-CT and EUS. The role of tumour markers such as CA 19-9 and CEA is reserved for monitoring and diagnosing post-surgery recurrence. Cytological or histological confirmation should usually be performed in patients that are not eligible for surgery prior to the commencement of palliative radio- or chemotherapy. In the routine clinical setting, MDR-CT and EUS play the predominant roles by providing the most cost-effective and accurate means for diagnosing and staging most cases of pancreatic cancer."

There is no consensus about the surgical management of these small tumors, although this clinical issue is crucial because some of the tumors show unexpected malignant behavior. In this study, we evaluated the clinical management of patients with gastric GISTs who underwent surgical resection. Altogether, 31 patients with gastric GISTs were examined retrospectively. Surgical resection was fundamentally indicated for the patients with gastric GISTs suspected to be malignant by endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). The malignant grade of the GISTs was evaluated by the mitotic rate, tumor size, and MIB-1 index. EUS was useful for differentiating benign from malignant GISTs; but by limiting the study to patients with small tumors (< 3 cm), the diagnostic value of EUS was not satisfactory for defining the surgical indication. Tumors that were < 50 mm were successfully treated by laparoscopic surgery. Of the 31 patients, 4 had a relapse of the disease, and 1 of those 4 patients had a small tumor (30 mm). All of the recurrences were classified in the high risk category. Surgery is indicated for gastric GISTs that are > or = 20 mm or are suspected to be malignant based on EUS findings. Laparoscopic resection is feasible and is recommended as the treatment of choice for patients with tumors < 50 mm. Risk assessment can be most useful for predicting recurrence."

Early diagnosis of adenocarcinoma improves the prognosis of the disease, which remains poor nowadays."

CD009944,0,16350723,0,[Diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties in MEN 1 syndrome].,"MEN 1 syndrome (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by the association of tumors in several endocrine glands, mainly in parathyroids, gut and pituitary. At our institution in the years 1982-2004 we have followed 26 patients with MEN 1 syndrome belonging to 19 families. The diagnosis of MEN 1 was based on Gubbio Consensus (JCEM 86: 5658-5671, 2001). Mean age at the diagnosis of MEN 1 was 35 years. Primary hyperparathyroidism was the most frequent pathology, which was diagnosed in 25 of 26 patients (96%). Gut endocrine tumors were found in 20 patients (77%), while pituitary tumors in 18 (70%). Non-functioning gut tumors were most frequent (n=9), followed by insulinoma (n=7) and gastrinoma (n=4). Prolactinoma was the most frequent pituitary tumor found in 12 patients (67%). Three patients died during the observation period - all of them of generalized gut endocrine tumor (gastrinoma in 2 cases and foregut carcinoid in one case). The management of MEN 1 is not easy and careful analysis of clinical picture is necessary in each individual case. Several important observations can be made on the basis of own experience and the literature: 1. In each sporadic pathology, which may be a part of MEN 1, one should consider. the possibility of MEN 1. The individual MEN 1 abnormalities are often diagnosed after 40 and later 2. MEN 1 tumor are usually multiple thus necessitating a different therapeutic approach (more radical surgery) 3. The most valuable screening tests are: Ca++, PP, CgA and prolactin 4. Endoscopic ultrasound is the most specific method for the localization of pancreatic endocrine tumors. 5. The results of surgical treatment of MEN 1 tumors are worse than that of sporadic tumors. 6. Prognosis in MEN 1 is determined by the behaviour of gut neuroendocrine tumor 7. No genotype/phenotype correlation in MEN 1 syndrome was found so far. In summary, it should be underlined that MEN 1 syndrome is an endocrine disorder, in which early diagnosis and optimal treatment may significantly improve the prognosis."

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has added a new level of accuracy for EUS in nodal staging, with reported numbers in the 90% range for luminal and pancreaticobiliary disease. In addition, new non-gastrointestinal applications are being evaluated, such as the role of EUS-FNA for the staging of non-small-cell lung cancer and exploration of the posterior mediastinum. Furthermore, the same techniques that make safe tissue sampling possible are being explored for their use as interventional applications, such as EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis, fine-needle injection, EUS-guided pseudocyst drainage, and EUS-guided cholangiography and pancreatography. This review describes the current clinical status of EUS in gastrointestinal oncology, as well as future and novel indications and therapeutic strategies for this technology."
CD009944,0,16253903,0,Pancreatic tumours as part of the MEN-1 syndrome.,"Pancreaticoduodenal tumours (PETs) occur in a majority of MEN-1 patients, and have appeared as a major cause of disease-related death. Previous discussions about treatment have mainly dealt with management of various functioning tumours and clinical syndromes of hormone excess. However, hormonal syndromes often occur late with MEN-1 pancreatic tumours, and when developed indicate presence of metastases in up to 50% of the patients. Prospective screening is therefore recommended in MEN-1 with biochemical markers and endoscopic ultrasound for early detection of PETs, and early surgery before metastases have developed. Surgery is recommended in patients with or without hormonal syndromes in absence of disseminated liver metastases. The suggested operation includes enucleation of tumours in the head of the pancreas, excision of duodenal gastrinomas together with clearance of lymph node metastases, and distal 80% subtotal pancreatic resection as prophylaxis against tumour recurrence. This strategy with early and aggressive surgery is believed to reduce the risks for malignant progression."

Therapeutic algorithms are proposed depending mainly on analogous TNM categories and grading considering conventional and experimental surgical and non-surgical therapy. Colonic neuroendocrine tumours are often misdiagnosed as undifferentiated adenocarcinoma and are therefore not properly treated with adjuvant and additive chemotherapy. As most rectal neuroendocrine tumours are benign because of submucosal extension only, the size and infiltration depth correlates with lymph-node and distant metastases and therefore with the prognosis. It is unknown whether endoscopic ultrasound can improve the diagnostic accuracy compared to size-related conclusions, and therefore whether it can change therapeutic strategies and improve survival by modern rectal surgery."

In addition to recent cases immediately diagnosed as GISTs, a pathological review of stored material from non-epithelial tumors of the gastrointestinal tract operated on over the past 20 years was performed. Twenty-three out of a total of 31 cases were shown to be positive for the immunophenotypic characteristics (CD117/CD34) of GISTs. Most cases (approximately 60%) were symptomatic, with hemorrhage being the most common presenting sign, followed by occlusion, pain and perforation. Asymptomatic cases were detected incidentally during procedures for other conditions. Diagnostic techniques (ultrasound, endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, X-ray, CT, MRI) allowed only the detection of wall (extraluminal) involvement. Apart from differentiating between benign and malignant, preoperative biopsy was seldom valuable. All cases were treated surgically, with intervention tailored to location and anatomical/surgical and anatomical/pathological features. Long-term follow-up was conducted in all patients and for most is still ongoing: five patients died from recurrent disease at varying intervals after surgery (from 17 to 102 months). Relationships between observed aggressiveness and risk were studied. Parameters that may prove useful for the early detection and appropriate management of these lesions are discussed."
CD009944,0,16193595,0,Diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastatic to mediastinal lymph nodes by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy.,"We report the case of a patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who was diagnosed as having metastasis in mediastinal lymph nodes and successfully underwent systemic chemotherapy without surgery. A 61-year-old male with a history of nasopharyngeal carcinoma presented with odynophagia. Examination revealed two palpable lymph nodes in the right neck. Pharyngoscopy showed a mass in the left inferior pharyngeal mucosa, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed only chronic gastritis, with no sign of esophageal disease. Chest CT confirmed the presence of a non-enhancing 20-mm soft tissue mass in the paraesophageal area, with increased attenuation compared with the adjacent esophagus. To evaluate this lesion we applied endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA). Two passes were made with a 21-gauge fine needle and the patient tolerated the procedure well, without complications. Cytological findings were compatible with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from a nasopharyngeal tumor, and the clinical stage was determined as T3N2bM1 (stage IVC) because of mediastinal lymph node metastasis. We thus determined the nodal status of a head and neck tumor by means of EUS-FNA. In conclusion, EUS-FNA is a safe and reliable technique for evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and is especially valuable for head and neck tumors with suspected metastasis."

Part 1: Stomach, oesophagus and colon.","Primary gastrointestinal lymphomas are most common in the stomach, followed by small intestine and then colon. The most frequently used pathology classification of lymphomas is the Revised European and American Lymphoma /World Health Organization classification. The correlation of radiological morphology with histology is relatively poor, although characteristic subtypes will be discussed. In the stomach, the majority of primary lymphomas are of B-cell origin of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type. Low-grade MALT lymphomas are associated with Helicobacter pylori infection and often respond to eradication of this organism. Radiological features include thickened folds, nodularity, depressed lesions, ulcers, prominent areae gastricae. High-grade (large B-cell) tumour patterns include infiltrative, polypoid, nodular, ulcerated or a combination. Endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound and CT are important in diagnosis and staging, although appearances on barium studies should be recognized. Primary colonic lymphomas are rare. Most are of B-cell origin. Focal and diffuse forms are seen, the former producing polypoid or nodular or cavitating masses and the latter producing ulcerative or nodular (polyposis) patterns on imaging. Even when circumferential, lymphoma rarely causes obstruction. Small bowel lymphomas will be discussed in the forthcoming part 2 of this review."
CD009944,0,16166979,0,Gastric cancer.,"Gastric cancer is a very challenging malignancy given that it presents late, has complex pathogenetic mechanisms with multiple carcinogenic processes implicated, and is only moderately sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation. Accurate staging for gastric cancer is possible with the availability of sophisticated imaging studies, endoscopic ultrasound, and laparoscopy. Postoperative chemoradiation is the standard of care in high-risk patients with resected primary disease. Recent encouraging results with the preoperative approach need to be studied further and prospectively compared to postoperative chemoradiation. Chemotherapy has yielded better results than best supportive care for metastatic gastric cancer and also improves quality of life, although all of these studies included a small number of patients. The last decade has seen newer agents used alone or in combination, with promising results. We anticipate that improved trial design, availability of molecular techniques, and continued search for better cytotoxic and targeted agents will help develop better treatments for patients with advanced gastric cancer."

CD009944,0,16138769,0,[Current diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer].,"Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (pancreatic cancer) is the most frequent tumor entity in the pancreas. While the results of surgical therapy of pancreatic cancer were disappointing in the past due to high perioperative mortality rates, resection of pancreatic cancer nowadays represents the standard treatment for non-metastatic cancer with a mortality rate below 5%. This decrease in perioperative mortality of the Whipple operation is inversely correlated to the case load of the hospital and the responsible surgeon, and is mainly related to improvements in the intensive care management, the surgical technique and patient selection. In particular, the perioperative use of octreotide resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of pancreatic fistula. Furthermore, modern staging examinations such as diagnostic laparoscopy, PET, or endoscopic ultrasound resulted in improved patient selection. In addition, the long-term results of the surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer has been improved by adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the past 10 years. Similar progress has been made in the palliative treatment of metastatic or locally advanced cancer. Nowadays, endoscopic procedures can replace surgical palliation of obstructive jaundice in most cases and sometimes even gastric outlet obstruction. Moreover, systemic chemotherapy using gemcitabine-based protocols has resulted in a significant prolongation of survival. However, further progress in the treatment of pancreatic cancer can only be achieved by an interdisciplinary management of this disease."

Two patients, a 56-year-old woman and a 60-year-old man, were admitted to our department for the treatment of a large submucosal tumor of the stomach. After gastrointestinal endoscopy, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, we suspected that the masses, measuring 7.0 cm and 8.0 cm in diameter, respectively, were GISTs in the stomach. However, preoperatively, we could not rule out the possibility of malignant neoplasms, because they had been bleeding or gradually growing. Hand-assisted laparoscopic wedge resection was safely performed for the diagnosis and treatment of the submucosal tumor of the stomach. The immunohistochemical diagnosis in both patients was GIST of the stomach with intermediate-grade malignancy. HALS may be a good indication for large GISTs of the stomach that are difficult to diagnose preoperatively, whether they are malignant or benign, because it is safe and minimally invasive, promoting rapid recovery."

Radiographic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract disclosed a nodule with central depression in the lower esophagus. By endoscopy the nodule was yellowish and appeared submucosal. Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated a hypoechoic solid tumour limited in submucosa without lymph node involvement. Endoscopic resection using band ligation was performed under guidance by endoscopic ultrasonography. By histologic examination the tumour consisted of large cells arranged in nests. These cells had abundant granular cytoplasm and small round nuclei. They expressed S-100 protein and were CD68, and periodic acid-Schiff positive. No expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin was noted. The tumour was limited in submucosa. Findings were consistent with complete endoscopic resection.

CD009944,0,16001347,0,Giant fold gastritis with consecutive gastric carcinoma in a patient with peutz-jeghers syndrome.,"We describe the case of a 36-year-old patient with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and a very unusual gastric morphology resembling giant fold gastritis. The latter lacked additional features of Menetrier's syndrome, was not influenced by eradication of Helicobacter pylori and persisted for more than ten years under regular endoscopic surveillance. Histologically, foveolar hyperplasia was found in the enlarged folds. Endoscopic ultrasound documented a hyperechoic widening of the gastric mucosa without involvement of the deeper layers. However, despite annual control gastroscopies, an adenocarcinoma developed between the folds and was in an already advanced stage at diagnosis (UICC III). We suggest that a variant of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome may be characterised by marked foveolar hyperplasia similar to Menetrier disease, and that not conventional endoscopy alone, but rather endoscopic ultrasound may be considered in such patients."
CD009944,0,15990940,0,Curative endoscopic ultrasound-assisted submucosal resection of a gastric stromal tumor.,"Endoscopic submucosal resection has been proposed as a feasible alternative for the diagnosis and treatment of small submucosal tumors (< 3 cm), as compared to classic interventions (surgical intervention or frequent follow-up). Therapeutic options should be established after precise endoscopic ultrasound assessment of the tumor characteristics. We present the case of a 60 year-old patient, admitted to the Emergency Department for upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Upper GI endoscopy showed a submucosal tumor on the posterior gastric wall, with hyperemic covering mucosa, without central ulceration. Endoscopic ultrasound identified a 10-mm well-delimited hypoechoic lesion, with the origin in the third hyperechoic layer (submucosa). After injection of 1:10000 epinephrine in the submucosa, with subsequent elevation of the protrusive formation, we performed an endoscopic submucosal resection without any complications. Pathology exam showed a gastric stromal tumor with low mitotic activity, the endoscopic resection being considered curative. The absence of independent risk factors determined by ultrasound endoscopy (size > 3 cm, irregular margins, hyperechoic foci > 3 mm, cystic spaces > 4 mm, presence of intratumoral Doppler signal), as well as the low mitotic activity, permitted the subsequent follow-up of the patient. A control endoscopic examination performed after 4 weeks showed the healing of the post-resection ulceration. In conclusion, ultrasound endoscopy allowed the establishment of a correct presumptive diagnosis and the subsequent assistance of endoscopic submucosal resection, used for pathological confirmation and for curative endoscopic treatment."

We report a rare case of MALT-lymphoma, invading all of the gastric wall, which regressed after eradication of H. pylori. The regression was well documented by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). A 70-year-old man was referred to us for upper endoscopy that showed a single ulcer of 3cm in diameter at the gastric angulus. Histology, immunohistochemistry and PCR analyses diagnosed a low-grade MALT-lymphoma in the presence of H. pylori infection. EUS showed a tumor invasion of all the gastric wall. The serosa layer, also, appeared irregular and interrupted in some points. The lymph nodes around the duodenum and the stomach were not involved. An anti-H. pylori therapy was started. After 1 year from the diagnosis, EUS showed the reappearance of the normal layers of the stomach. The patient is actually disease free. This result suggests that in EI2-stage gastric lymphoma of MALT type, in the absence of both high-grade malignancy foci and t(11;18)(q21;q21) chromosomal translocation, an eradication treatment may be considered as a first therapeutic option."

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a unique type of extranodal lymphoma which is associated with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). The development of low-grade MALT lymphoma of stomach is dependent on H. pylori. A transformed clone carrying the translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) forms a MALT lymphoma, the growth of which is independent of H. pylori and will not respond to bacterial eradication. And inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes, p53 can lead to high-grade transformation. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is essential to document the extent of disease and is superior to CT scan in the detection of spread to perigastric lymph nodes and follow-up EUS may determine the response to therapy and detect the relapse in early phase. Lesions that are confined to the mucosa or submucosa of gastric wall can be successfully treated with H. pylori eradication. Those low-grade MALT lymphomas that are not H. pylori positive or do not respond to antibiotic therapy can be treated with surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Follow-up is critical in all patients who have been treated with H. pylori eradication and consists of multiple endoscopic biopsies and EUS."
CD009944,0,15894867,0,The emerging role of endoscopic ultrasonography in cancer staging.,"The management of solid organ cancers relies on accurate staging. Once distal metastasis has been excluded by conventional radiographic methods, local staging of the tumor and its nodal involvement is essential to determine the most optimal therapeutic approach. Many radiographic imaging modalities are unable to determine subtle tumor involvement. However, the emergence of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has given promise to improved staging with its unique ability to examine tumors from within the gastrointestinal lumen with extremely close proximity. An additional advantage is the ability to perform fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy to confirm or exclude tumor involvement. Many studies have shown superior accuracy in staging with EUS and EUS-FNA for tumors of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, rectum, and mediastinum, including lung cancer. This review illustrates the principles of EUS and its role in staging of a variety of cancers and particularly its role alongside other imaging modalities."

Both patients were positive for H. pylori, and later received H. pylori eradication therapy. The disease has not recurred after 11 and 6 months, respectively.

Recently, minimally invasive surgical procedures for benign gastric conditions have been advocated, and the laparoscopic approach is noted as a technique that increases the quality of life. However, the development of laparoscopic gastric resections and laparoscopically assisted gastric operations for malignancy still deserve a word of caution. Laparoscopic local resection of the stomach is used to treat mucosal cancer without lymph node metastasis, and laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy is used to treat early gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis in the perigastric portion. According to short-term results reported by a small group of surgeons, laparoscopic approaches for gastric cancer result in a minimally invasive approach, early recovery, and decreased morbidity and mortality. However, the longterm results of these less invasive treatments are not known in advanced gastric cancer. If the results of randomized controlled studies for advanced gastric cancer are confirmed, the use of these techniques will spread worldwide and may become a standard technique for the resection of gastric cancer."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of this change in treatment strategy on both the overall disease profile and locoregional endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) staging accuracy for a cohort of patients managed with primary surgical resection over a 10-year period at our institution. All subjects at our institution who underwent primary esophagectomy from 1993 to 2002 following preoperative EUS for known or suspected esophageal and/or GEJ cancers were identified. Patients with dysplasia alone, prior upper gastrointestinal tract surgery, preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, cancer of the gastric cardia or recurrent malignancy were excluded. EUS findings and staging results were compared to surgical pathology following resection. The impact of the gradually increased use of primary chemoradiation during the second half of the study was assessed. Of the 286 operations performed, 184 subjects were excluded. The remaining 102 underwent primary surgical resection a median of 18 days following EUS staging for adenocarcinoma (88%) or squamous cell carcinoma (12%) of the esophagus (69%) or GEJ (31%). Overall EUS locoregional T and N staging accuracy was 72% and 75% respectively; accuracy for T1, T2, T3 and T4 cancer was 42%, 50%, 88% and 50% respectively. Despite an increased frequency of pathologically confirmed T1 and T2 cancers (P = 0.005) and an insignificant trend toward increased N0 malignancy (P = 0.05) during the second half of the study period, no statistically significant changes in T (P = 0.07) or N (P = 0.82) staging accuracies for EUS or disease characteristics were noted between the first and second half of the study period. Despite both inaccurate radial EUS staging and increased relative use of primary surgery for early cancers, recent increased use of primary neoadjuvant therapy did not change overall disease characteristics and accuracy of locoregional EUS staging of esophageal and GEJ cancers managed with primary surgical resection."
CD009944,0,15772477,0,Gastric cancer mimicking a submucosal tumor diagnosed by laparoscopic excision biopsy.,"We report a case of advanced gastric cancer exhibiting the features of a submucosal tumor (SMT) of the gastric body. The patient was a 50-year-old male in whom a gastric SMT was detected during a mass screening examination. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a protuberant tumor, 2 cm in diameter, covered with normal-appearing mucosa. Examination of an endoscopic biopsy specimen of the tumor revealed chronic gastritis with regenerative and erosive changes. An endoscopic ultrasound examination demonstrated a hypoechoic mass in the third layer of the gastric wall. The clinical diagnosis was gastric SMT, and the patient's course was monitored. Twenty-six months after the initial visit to our hospital, an endosonograph-guided biopsy revealed Group III (borderline lesion). Three months after the biopsy, the size of the SMT had increased slightly. Laparoscopic wedge resection of the tumor was performed to make a pathologic diagnosis and we were able to make a diagnosis of gastric lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma intraoperatively. Gastrectomy with lymph node dissection was followed as curative surgery. Laparoscopic total excision biopsy is a useful technique in patients with a gastric SMT whose diagnosis has not been confirmed pathologically."
CD009944,0,15758616,0,EUS in the management of the patient with dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus.,"Barrett's esophagus is the most important risk factor in the development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is generally regarded as the most significant complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Adenocarcinoma occurs more frequently in the setting of high-grade dysplasia. The prognosis of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is strongly correlated with the stage of disease. The prognosis of late stage disease is extremely poor. Cure may be achieved when disease is found at an early stage. Esophagectomy has been the definitive treatment of limited stage adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The morbidity and mortality rate for esophagectomy is high. Therefore, alternative endoscopic methods for curative treatments have gained popularity. The two main endoscopic therapies, photodynamic therapy and endoscopic mucosal resection, are both effective when applied to early-stage disease. Traditional evaluation of the patient with Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia includes esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy and computed tomography of the chest. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has gained popularity in the evaluation of the patient with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia because it is the only imaging technique capable of delineating the separate histologic layers of the gastrointestinal tract. The principal role of EUS in evaluating patients with Barrett's-associated dysplasia is to identify patients who may be candidates for endoscopic ablative (endoscopic mucosal resection, photodynamic therapy) therapies. EUS has been shown to be superior to computed tomography (including high resolution spiral CT) or magnetic resonance imaging for preoperative staging in patients with high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma. This review of the literature summarizes the ability of EUS to evaluate patients with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia."

CD009944,0,15657854,0,Diagnosis of esophagogastric tumors.,"With regard to esophageal tumors, important reports on several topics have been published recently. 1) The place of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) as the best locoregional staging technique for cancer of the esophagus has been further consolidated. The addition of fine-needle aspiration makes EUS more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) and more accurate than CT or EUS alone for nodal staging. 2) High-resolution endoscopy with chromoendoscopy has been found to be very effective for mucosal lesions, but not for submucosal lesions. In combination with EUS, the sensitivity for submucosal tumors increases up to 60 %. 3) Autofluorescence-guided biopsy has been reported to be a good tool for detecting high-grade dysplasia. A narrow-band imaging system improved the overall accuracy for depth of invasion. 4) The incidence of hypopharyngeal cancer increases after resection for esophageal carcinoma. Patients with a scattered staining pattern after application of Lugol's solution are more prone to develop upper lesions. 5) Fluorescence imaging makes it possible to detect low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia in Barrett's mucosa, with fewer biopsies. 6) Patients with Barrett's esophagus with a length of over 3 cm had a significantly greater prevalence of dysplasia in comparison with those in the whom the Barrett's segment was shorter than 3 cm (23 % vs. 9 %, P = 0.0001). With regard to gastric tumors, 1) Helicobacter pylori eradication can significantly reduce the development of gastric cancer, but only in patients without precancerous lesions. 2) Intestinal metaplasia types II and III have been shown to have a higher rate of progression to low-grade dysplasia than type I. 3) With regard to screening in asymptomatic individuals, serum pepsinogen may represent an alternative to conventional fluoroscopy methods. 4) In patients who have undergone esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, annual follow-up endoscopies are vital for detecting early secondary gastric cancer and ulcerations in which curative treatment is possible. 5) High-resolution endoscopy allows more precise diagnosis of early gastric cancer. The presence of irregular minute vessels and variations in vessel caliber were found to be specific of early gastric cancer. The small regular pattern of sulci and ridges was observed significantly more frequently in differentiated carcinoma than in undifferentiated carcinoma. 6) Infrared-ray electronic endoscopy combined with indocyanine green injection appears to be effective in detecting sentinel nodes that contain metastases in patients with gastric cancer. 7) Gastric adenocarcinoma was found to show specific changes in the fluorescence spectra emitted, in comparison with normal gastric mucosa. However, there was wide variation in the emitted autofluorescence spectra in gastric cancer with signet-ring cells in comparison with normal mucosa."

CD009944,0,15756395,0,Ampullary tumors: endoscopic versus operative management.,"Most ampullary adenomas (80%) are common benign ampullary tumors; however, they can range from mild dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. They are considered premalignant lesions found in the setting of familial polyposis syndromes or found sporadically, usually manifested by vague abdominal pain, liver enzyme elevation, jaundice, recurrent pancreatitis, or with uncommon symptoms such as gastrointestinal bleeding or duodenal obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biopsy is a minimally invasive technique used to visualize these tumors directly and to evaluate their histologic characteristics. Definitive treatment primarily depends on these histologic results. Local resection has a high rate of recurrence (5% to 30%) and requires postoperative endoscopic surveillance, which is the reason it is not considered as a first choice in the management of ampullary tumors. The operative mortality is 10% or less for pancreaticoduodenectomy, a procedure of choice at most experienced centers for frank carcinoma, foci papillary adenocarcinoma in pre-excisional biopsies, or high-grade dysplasia ampullary adenomas. Endoscopic interventions for presumed benign ampullary adenomas have resolved symptoms of obstruction, but long-term follow up is necessary to detect early malignant transformation. In summary, the choice of treatment depends on level of surgical skill available, patient tolerance of long-term endoscopic surveillance versus radical surgery, and the presence or absence of coexisting familial adenomatous polyposis."

CD009944,0,15630987,0,[Surgical treatment of early adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's oesophagus].,"Endoscopy with biopsy, endoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) are prerequisites for an exact preoperative staging of patients with oesophageal cancer. Diagnosing an early adenocarcinoma limited to the mucosa (pT1m), the risk of lymph node metastase is nearly zero. Therefore, consideration could be given to ablate endoscopically the metaplastic mucosa including the pT1m-area. On the other hand, an adenocarcinoma that is invading into the submucosa (pTlsm) has an 18 to 50% likelihood of associated lymphnode metastases. In these patients with a highly curable form of oesophageal cancer only oesophageal resection with systematic abdominal and mediastinal lymph node dissection represents the standard of care. This seems to be also true for more advanced tumours without or with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Because of substantial complications and long-term side effects the need for extensive resection in patients with early tumour stage (pT1) or down staged 'early' carcinoma (yT1) is questionable. Therefore, a limited resection of distal oesophagus and proximal stomach with two-field lymphadenectomy and jejunal interposition is an attractive alternative in early Barrett's carcinoma providing a low morbidity and mortality and resulting in a more than 90% chance of cure, perhaps in successfully down staged yT1-patients as well. Therefore, the extent of oesophageal resection should be tailored to the patient and the known extent of tumour disease. Although, there is no clear evidence at present that RCTx prolongs survival in patients with potentially resectable oesophageal cancer, preoperative treatment appears to increase the chance for a curative resection. Generally, in case of a T4-tumour or distant metastasis a surgical treatment is not indicated."

By endoscopic ultrasonography, SMT was demonstrated as a well-circumscribed, smooth-bordered and hypoechoic mass localized in the submucosal layer. Total gastrectomy was performed. The histology of the resected specimen revealed a gastric lipoma and an early gastric cancer widespread to the surface on the lipoma. Two lesions were present in the same lesion, but not linked.

EWDA may be a gastric counterpart of 'adenoma malignum' or minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) in the uterine cervix; however, the clinicopathological features of EWDA remain less apparent than those of MDA. A 60-year-old male was complaining of dysphagia. He had been made aware of a small submucosal tumor in the cardia 2 years before the onset of this symptom. Endoscopic ultrasonographic examination revealed a large cardiac tumor consisting of thickened layers, as observed in Borrmann type IV. Three mucosal biopsies suggested only benign changes including adenoma and hyperplastic polyps. At the fourth biopsy, cytologically bland columnar cells were located in the submucosa along with stromal fibrosis and laminated stones. The possibility that non-neoplastic aberrant pancreas with lithiasis formed the tumor was denied at laparotomy by a frozen section that revealed benign-looking glands invading the diaphragm. Immunohistochemically the cancer glands were positive for CA19-9 and human gastric mucin, but not for p53 or MUC2. To our knowledge, this is a previously unknown combination of EWDA and psammomatous calcification in the stomach."

CD009944,0,15455287,0,[Gastrointestinal lymphomas].,"Based on new insights into aetiology and pathogenesis of gastrointestinal lymphomas and their histomorphological and molecular characteristics, important progress in their diagnostics and therapy has been made during recent years. The WHO has established an internationally accepted classification of gastrointestinal lymphomas. Although not considered therein, from the clinical point of view a differentiation between low- and high-grade lymphomas would seem to be helpful as the grade of malignancy and stage directly determine the therapeutic strategy. Therefore, a thorough endoscopic-bioptic technique (gastric mapping) and careful clinical staging is necessary. The latter should always include endoscopic ultrasound. Helicobacter pylori represents the decisive causal factor for gastric MALT lymphomas while untreated sprue is an established risk factor for intestinal T cell lymphomas. The therapeutic spectrum ranges from Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy to the well known oncological modalities, namely chemotherapy, radiation or surgery and their combined use. However, also a watch-and-wait strategy may be a good choice in the individual case (minimal residual disease after successful Helicobacter pylori eradication or disseminated stages of indolent lymphomas not offering a curative option)."
CD009944,0,15368107,0,Still any role for transduodenal local excision in tumors of the papilla of Vater?,"Tumors of the papilla and ampulla of Vater are rare neoplasms which are usually detected at an early stage due to their symptoms. The accurate preoperative histological diagnosis and staging of ampullary tumors is often difficult and inconclusive, leading to controversy over the adequate treatment of these lesions. Three procedures are currently being used to treat such tumors. Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is a procedure with low morbidity and mortality at experienced centers, and is considered the treatment of choice for invasive carcinoma and large benign ampullary lesions with suspicion of malignancy. Transduodenal local excision (TDE) of ampullary tumors is a relatively simple procedure with operative morbidity and mortality rates comparable to PD. TDE is challenged at endoscopic centers by endoscopic snare excision (ESE). Due to technical advances, the safety and outcomes of ESE for ampullary tumors have improved in recent years. ESE and TDE represent adequate methods for treatment of benign tumors and also for small malignant tumors detected at an early stage if the diagnosis and stage have been accurately established preoperatively. Due to the safety of PD and the technical advances of ESE, TDE is reserved for selected patients. Randomized controlled studies are needed to establish the correct indications for PD, TDE, and ESE."
CD009944,0,15362758,0,Esophageal intramural spreading from an adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction.,"Although intramural spreading from gastric carcinoma to the esophageal wall is occasionally reported, longitudinal intramural lesion of the esophagus is very rare. We herein report the case of a patient found to have a carcinoma of the gastric cardia with intramural spreading to the esophagus approximately 7.0 cm in length. A 65-year-old man was admitted to our department suffering from a persistent midthoracic pain and mild dysphagia during the previous 3 months. Upper gastrointestinal studies revealed an oval submucosal tumor of the lower esophagus and a flare irregular lesion on the esophagogastric junction. An endoscopic ultrasonography showed the main tumor was in the submucosal layer and invaded beyond the muscularis propria. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen confirmed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 7.0 cm in length, which penetrated through the gastric wall, and invaded the submucosal layer of the esophagus. When only a few scattered carcinoma cells infiltrate only the mucosa or submucosa, it is difficult to diagnose the extent of esophageal invasion. In treating patients with gastric cancer with esophageal invasion, it is important to determine the safety of the proximal margin for esophageal resection. Histological examination using frozen sections obtained during surgery is essential for deciding the operative safety margin."

CD009944,0,15297944,0,Imaging of esophageal and gastric cancer.,"The three major aims of imaging in esophageal and gastric cancer are to distinguish between locoregional and systemic disease (M stage), to determine local tumor extension (T and N stages), and to assess response to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Depending on the applied standard of reference, the sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) for detection of distant metastases ranges between less than 50% to greater than 90%. In esophageal cancer, positron emission tomography with the glucose analog fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) has been shown to detect metastatic disease in approximately 20% of the patients who were considered to have only locoregional disease with CT. In clinical studies, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been shown to differentiate between tumor stages T1/T2 and stages T3/T4 with an accuracy of more than 90%. Accuracy of EUS for differentiating individual tumor stages in routine clinical use has been reported to be markedly lower. Assessment of tumor response by FDG-PET has been shown to correlate with histopathologic tumor regression and patient survival. Furthermore, quantitative measurements of tumor FDG uptake may predict histopathologic tumor response and patient outcome as early as 2 weeks after initiation of preoperative chemotherapy."
CD009944,0,15297943,0,Staging and preoperative evaluation of upper gastrointestinal malignancies.,"Esophageal and gastric cancers are distinct carcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal tract, although the distinction between them becomes less clear at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Increasingly accurate staging is possible based on newer radiographic and surgical techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), laparoscopy and thoracoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). For both cancer types, tumor classification is determined by depth of penetration of the primary tumor into the gastric or esophageal wall. For esophageal cancer, primary tumor anatomic position-upper, mid, and lower esophagus-is used to define the local nodal basin. Metastases in nodes outside the local basin are considered to be distant (M) rather than regional (N). In gastric cancer, the region of nodal metastasis has been abandoned in favor of the number of lymph nodes containing metastasis, which predicts outcome more accurately-patients with more than 15 positive lymph nodes have an outcome comparable to those with M disease. Increasing consideration is being given to the subclassification of tumors near the GEJ into types based on anatomical position, although this staging scheme (""Adenocarcinoma of the EsophagoGastric junction"" or AEG type) has not yet been universally adopted. We review the current pathologic staging systems for esophageal and gastric cancers, the clinical staging approaches for these diseases, and the controversy surrounding classification of tumors of the GEJ."

However, there is growing evidence that micrometastases are present in lymph nodes, which cannot be detected with standard pathological methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether hypermethylation gene promoter analysis was feasible on samples obtained by EUS-FNA from lymph nodes, as well as to establish the usefulness of this strategy for the detection of micrometastases in patients with gastrointestinal and non-small cell lung cancer. Suspicious lymph nodes based on EUS findings from consecutive patients with esophageal, gastric, rectal, and non-small cell lung cancer were sampled by EUS-FNA. Hypermethylation analysis of the MGMT, p16(INK4a), and p14(ARF) gene promoter CpG islands were performed by methylation-specific PCR. Effectiveness of conventional cytology, methylation analysis, and their combination were established with respect to the definitive diagnosis. Twenty-seven patients were included, thus representing a total of 42 lymph nodes (esophageal cancer, n = 11; rectal cancer, n = 7; gastric cancer, n = 3; and lung cancer, n = 21). According to definitive diagnosis, 21 (50%) corresponded to metastatic lymph nodes. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of conventional cytology were 76%, 100%, and 88%, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for the methylation analysis were 81%, 67%, and 74%, respectively. Combination of both techniques increased sensitivity (90%) but decreased specificity (67%) with respect to conventional cytology. In conclusion, it is feasible to detect occult neoplastic cells in EUS-FNA samples by hypermethylation gene promoter analysis. Moreover, addition of methylation analysis to conventional cytology may increase its sensitivity at the expenses of a decrease in its specificity."

Gastric MALT lymphomas are associated with chronic Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection. We report the case of a 67 year old man admitted for an 8-month history of epigastric pain, anorexia and progressive weight loss. He was diagnosed with low-grade primary gastric MALT lymphoma by endoscopy, histopathological examination of gastric mucosa (light microscopy and immunohistochemistry) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). The patient received a 2-week course of anti-HP therapy and chemotherapy with Chlorambucil 0.1 mg/kg/day was started. During the follow-up, continuous improvement of clinical status, endoscopic and EUS appearance was noted.

On 17 May 2001, thoracoscopic enucleation of the esophageal tumor was performed using a Kodama Di-suction. The Kodama Di-suction was useful for the thoracoscopic enucleation of the submucosal tumor of the esophagus, acting as both a dissector and a sucker. The patient's course was uneventful after surgery. Histopathologically the esophageal tumor revealed a high cellularity, consisting of spindle cells, and the tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for CD34 and c-kit protein, but not for a-smooth muscle actin or S-100 protein.

Accurate staging is essential for selection of the best mode of therapy and to predict prognosis. In addition, with widespread use of neoadjuvant therapy, accurate assessment of response to therapy has become very important because responders have better a prognosis than nonresponders. Anatomical imaging methods, such as computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasonography, that are commonly used to evaluate esophageal cancer have shortcomings in demonstrating the true extent of disease and in assessing or predicting response to therapy. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) has been shown to be a useful adjunct to anatomical imaging methods. For initial staging of esophageal cancer, the combination of PET and endoscopic ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration biopsy has been suggested to be the most effective strategy. For restaging and monitoring response to therapy, FDG-PET has been shown to be superior to conventional imaging. The incidence of gastric cancer is decreasing worldwide, but it is also a highly lethal cancer. Similar to esophageal cancer, noninvasive staging of this cancer is unsatisfactory. Approximately one-third of the patients thought to have limited disease and to be candidates for surgery by conventional staging methods, are found to have advanced disease at surgery. Only a few published studies have evaluated gastric cancer with FDG-PET. These studies suggest that FDG-PET may be useful in evaluating gastric cancers of intestinal type and nonmucinous tumors."

CD009944,0,15123091,0,Ultrasound-guided endoscopic surgery.,"Ten years' development of sectorial linear endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has allowed us to perform guided biopsies of lymph nodes, mediastinal masses and pancreatic tumours. Furthermore, biopsy guided by EUS has been the first step in the development of interventional EUS. This development, in turn, has been made possible by the appearance of the interventional echoendoscope with a large working channel. EUS-guided biopsy obtains the best results for lymph nodes, anastomotic relapses and extrinsicz compression as well as for pancreatic tumours. Results in the literature show a global sensitivity of the technique that varies between 76 and 91%, a specificity of 84-100% and an accuracy of 78-94%. Using alcohol injection of the plexus nerves, the coeliac block guided by EUS is a simple technique. It will replace percutaneous access under US or CT scan guidance. Data from the literature show a significant reduction in pain of the order of 85-90% of cases-results that would have been good for percutaneous techniques. The technique of cystoenterostomy guided by EUS allows more accurate drainage of the cysts with a lower risk of perforation and haemorrhage. With regard to haemorrhage it should be emphasized that colour Doppler and power Doppler assessment of the punctures rules out the risk of vascular perforation during puncture but the risk of haemorrhage due to decompression of a vascular lesion in the vicinity of the cyst remains. The new ultrasound echoendoscope EG 38X, with a large working channel (3.8 mm), is now available. This system allows more effective drainage and also enables the placement of cystodigestive stents."

It has also proved helpful with the sampling of lymphadenopathy both for the staging of malignancy and for the diagnosis of lymphadenopathy of other causes. We review our experience with EUS-guided FNA of lymph nodes. The cytology files were searched at Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) for all cases of lymph nodes sampled by EUS. Clinical history, biopsy site, diagnosis, and follow-up information (including ancillary testing) were reviewed. Between January 1, 2000 and December 5, 2002, 217 lymph nodes from 185 different patients were sampled by EUS at HCMC. Biopsy sites included 62 mediastinal, 9 paraesophageal, and 146 intra-abdominal lymph nodes. Diagnoses were as follows: metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (n = 69); benign, reactive lymph node (n = 76); granulomatous lymphadenopathy (n = 18); malignant lymphoma (n = 7); atypical-suspicious for malignancy (n = 5); metastatic small cell carcinoma (n = 2); necrotic debris (n = 4), and foreign material (n = 1); 35 cases were nondiagnostic (16.1%) in 22 of 185 patients (11.9%).

The diagnosis of gastric cancer at an early stage (early gastric cancer) represents the only hope for improving survival of these patients. Upper GI endoscopy (including chromoendoscopy and magnifying endoscopy) remains the corner-stone for diagnosis, although other modalities such as endoscopic ultrasonography, conventional radiographs, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and virtual endoscopy, are helpful. Histology always seals the correct diagnosis, and makes the final staging. The experience of the endoscopist is a critical point related to correct diagnosis. Better awareness by endoscopists of the various appearances of early gastric cancer, is mandatory. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, biological characteristics and diagnosis of early gastric cancer based on data derived from the currently available literature."

CD009944,0,15023013,0,Gastric cancer: diagnosis and treatment options.,"Although the overall incidence of gastric cancer has steadily declined in the United States, it is estimated that more than 12,000 persons died from gastric cancer in 2003. The incidence of distal stomach tumors has greatly declined, but reported cases of proximal gastric carcinomas, including tumors at the gastroesophageal junction, have increased. Early diagnosis of gastric cancer is difficult because most patients are asymptomatic in the early stage. Weight loss and abdominal pain often are late signs of tumor progression. Chronic atrophic gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, heavy alcohol use, and several dietary factors have been linked to increased risks for gastric cancer. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is the preferred diagnostic modality for evaluation of patients in whom stomach cancer is suspected. Accurate staging of gastric wall invasion and lymph node involvement is important for determining prognosis and appropriate treatment. Endoscopic ultrasonography, in combination with computed tomographic scanning and operative lymph node dissection, may be involved in staging the tumor. Treatment with surgery alone offers a high rate of failure. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not improved survival rates when used as single modalities, but combined therapy has shown some promise. Primary prevention, by control of modifiable risk factors and increased surveillance of persons at increased risk, is important in decreasing morbidity and mortality."
CD009944,0,15007245,0,New concepts of staging in gastrointestinal tumors as a basis of diagnosis and multimodal therapy.,"The therapy of gastrointestinal tumors is becoming more and more sophisticated and complex. This is due to an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of tumors, a more detailed classification and increasing therapeutic options. The basis of optimized therapeutic concepts is the exact evaluation of tumor spread and exact staging. The following review describes some of the most recent staging concepts in gastrointestinal tumors. Multislice computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and new supraparamagnetic iron oxide contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging enable an increasing quality of the visualization of tumors and metastases. 3D imaging will be used for planning of surgical interventions in the future. Optical coherence tomography may contribute to an improved tumor staging and, thus, to the safety of limited interventions in early oesophageal- and gastric cancer patients. Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound become increasingly important for the identification of small metastases in the peritoneum, in lymph nodes and in the liver. The sentinel lymph node concept will contribute to an improved staging and individualized therapy as well."

CD009944,0,14765308,0,Diagnosis of esophagogastric tumors.,"Esophagogastric tumors occur in three sectors: the esophagus, the EG junction and the non-cardia stomach. Neoplasia develops in the squamous stratified epithelium of the esophagus and in the columnar epithelium of the Barrett's esophagus or in the stomach. At the junction, tumors arise either in a very short Barrett's esophagus or in the gastric epithelium of the cardia. The prognosis of tumors detected at the advanced stage is poor. Secondary prevention requires detection at the early stage. Most superficial neoplastic lesions in the esophagus and in the stomach have a non-protruding appearance, which is similar for premalignant and malignant lesions. Improved accuracy in endoscopic diagnosis and prediction of histology prior to biopsy and treatment decision is based upon magnification with a optical zoom and electronic processing of the captured image with structure enhancement, enhancement of the color of hemoglobin and narrow band imaging. This applies particularly to the exploration of the Barrett's esophagus for identification of the areas with intestinal metaplasia and of flat neoplastic areas. In spite of the predictive value of endoscopy for histology, biopsy samples are still required for pathology and eventually studies with biological markers. Spectroscopic techniques provide a new perspective, up to the level of molecular endoscopy, but they are unlikely to be cost/effective. The classification in the sub-types 0 of neoplastic lesions has some relevance to prediction of depth of invasion. In the esophagus, EUS staging with high frequency miniprobes is a useful complement."

CD009944,0,14749619,0,Applications of endoscopic ultrasonography in pancreatic cancer.,"Accurate staging of pancreatic cancer is essential for surgical planning and for identification of locally advanced and metastatic disease that is incurable by surgery. Advances in endoscopic sonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography have improved the accuracy of staging and reduced the number of incomplete surgical resections. Tissue acquisition is necessary in nonsurgical cases when chemoradiotherapy is considered. The complex regional anatomy of the pancreas makes cytologic diagnosis of malignancy at this region difficult without exploratory surgery. Although CT-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is used for this purpose, reports of an increased risk of peritoneal dissemination of cancer cells and a false-negative rate of nearly 20% make this a poor choice. The ability to position the EUS-transducer in direct proximity to the pancreas by means of the stomach and duodenum, combined with the use of FNA, increases the specificity of EUS in detecting pancreatic malignancies."
CD009944,0,14745281,0,Pitfalls of endoscopic ultrasound staging after application of electrocautery.,"Patients may be referred for endosonography after endoscopic resection of polyps because of cancer identified in the histologic specimen. To assess the effects of electrocautery-induced tissue changes on tumor staging by endosonography, endosonography findings after endoscopic removal of large polyps were correlated with surgical and endoscopic pathology. Endosonography findings revealed irregular and thickened wall layers, especially in the muscularis propria with pseudopod extensions. Five of 7 patients had evidence of cancer in the endoscopic specimen. However, no residual tumor was found in the surgically resected bowel (2 patients) or in subsequent biopsies of the endoscopic resection site (3 patients). In 2 other patients, no cancer was present in the endoscopic specimen, and follow-up biopsies of the endoscopic resection site were all benign. Electrocautery-induced inflammatory changes create hypoechoic changes within the gut wall that may mimic tumor invasion. Irregularities in the muscularis propria layer cannot be relied upon to diagnose a T2 or T3 lesion by endosonography in this setting. Patients with large polyps greater than 2 cm and other mucosal lesions with malignant potential should undergo endosonography prior to endoscopic resection."

Its incidence in the West has been on the decline for more than 40 years; however, the location of gastric cancer has shifted proximally in the past 15 years. The reason for this shift is not clear. Diffuse histology is also more common now than intestinal type of histology. Advances have been made in staging procedures such as laparoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography and in possible functional imaging techniques. The current TNM classification requires an examination of at least 15 lymph nodes; therefore, at least a D1 dissection is recommended. Patients with locoregional gastric carcinoma should also be referred to high-volume treatment centers. Combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting for select group of patients is considered the new standard in the United States. The NCCN Gastric Cancer Guidelines portray uniformity in the systemic approach to cancer in the United States.

Except diarrhoea, less frequent in patients with ZES-MEN 1 than in sporadic ZES, and specific MEN 1-related signs, clinical characteristics are similar in both ZES types. Acid output and gastrin levels are also similar whether in the basal state or after secretin stimulation. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) exists in the majority of ZES-MEN 1 patients, 30% have pituitary adenoma (prolactinomas for half), 30% adrenal involvement, 25 to 30% have EC-Lomas; bronchial and thymic carcinoids have probably been underevaluated. Gastrinomas are multiple predominantly located in the duodenal wall, but also in the pancreas in association with clinically silent endocrine tumors. The spread of the disease: metastases to the liver (LM), mediastinum, bones, is evaluated at best by Octreoscan. Endoscopic ultrasonography evaluates the number, size and anatomical characteristics of gastrinomas. Patients without LM have an excellent prognosis. Surgery never cures ZES, but is necessary in case of associated life-threatening condition such as insulinoma and has been advocated to prevent LM development in patients with large pancreatic tumor(s). However although, indeed, the size of the tumor, when located in the pancreas > 3 cm, favours metachronous LM occurrence, surgery, in our experience, has not been able to prevent LM development. Hepatic malignancies remain however the most pejorative prognostic determinant for survival and raise the most difficult therapeutic challenge. Surgery is the best option whenever feasible; specific chemotherapy and chemo-embolisation have not conclusively achieved definite successes. Long-term octreotide treatment, however, has been shown recently to obtain tumour stabilisation. Internal irradiation with 90 Ytrium-labelled octreotide is a new promising option, presently under evaluation (Novartis European trial). Preliminary results are promising."
CD009944,0,14653414,0,Staging esophageal adenocarcinoma.,"The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased dramatically in Western societies over the last 20 years. Most patients present with advanced disease. Stage-dependent treatment protocols require the most complete and accurate staging possible. With all esophageal cancers (ie, adenocarcinomas and squamous carcinomas), it is perhaps most important to identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from aggressive treatment. The performance characteristics and clinical utility of CT scanning, endoscopic ultrasound, FDG-PET, and minimally invasive surgery in staging esophageal cancer are reviewed, including issues relating specifically to staging of adenocarcinomas. These investigations are not mutually exclusive and each has its own strengths and shortcomings. Accurate staging often requires the use of multiple modalities. The optimal staging algorithm for a given practice setting (if it exists) will be determined largely by local variables that include patient population, available technology, and local expertise in applying such technology. A lack of consensus on the effectiveness of therapeutic alternatives (particularly surgical v nonsurgical methods) may also affect the perceived value of the various staging modalities and how they are used."

This therapeutic procedure was used as an alternative method of drainage of the biliary tree because endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was not possible and because the percutaneous metallic stent which had been inserted earlier had become occluded (probably by tumor overgrowth). It was a two-step procedure. In the first step a hepatic duct was punctured through the gastric wall with placement of a plastic stent, which created a fistula between them. In a second step a covered, metallic, self-expandable stent was substituted for the plastic stent to maintain the anastomosis and to improve patency over the medium term.

The tumor locations were the gastric cardia (n = 2), gastroesophageal junction (n = 1), gastric fundus (n = 2), and gastric antrum (n = 2). Laparoscopic localization of endoluminal tumors included intraoperative endoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound, and laparoscopic palpation. There were five males with a mean age of 57 years. Laparoscopic approaches to resection were laparoscopic wedge resection (n = 4) for tumors in the gastric fundus and antrum, laparoscopic enucleation (n = 2) for tumors in the gastric cardia, and transgastric endoluminal resection (n = 1) for a tumor located at the gastroesophageal junction. There was no conversion to laparotomy. The mean operative time was 143 +/- 54 minutes and mean blood loss was 57 +/- 27 mL. None of the patients required intensive care stay. The mean length of hospital stay was 3 days. There were no major or minor complications and no mortality. Surgical pathology demonstrated gastric stromal tumor with less than 2/50 mitosis per high power field in all seven specimens. Tumor size ranged from 2.8 cm to 7.1 cm in greatest diameter. There has been no tumor recurrence with a mean follow-up of 9 months. Laparoscopic resection of benign gastric stromal tumor is safe and feasible.

CD009944,0,12809817,0,Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.,"The connection between Helicobacter pylori and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is well established. H. pylori infection causes an immunological response, leading to chronic gastritis with formation of lymphoid follicles within the stomach. These lymphoid follicles resemble nodal tissues found throughout the body and are composed of reactive T cells and activated plasmal cells and B cells. The B cells are responsible for initiating a clonal expansion of centrocyte-like cells that form the basic histology of MALT lymphoma. Early diagnosis of MALT lymphoma is difficult but essential for adequate treatment. Clinical symptoms are vague and varied, with abdominal pain being a common presenting complaint. The endoscopic appearance of this tumor is varied and can be infiltrative, exophytic, or ulcerative. In addition, the tumor can have a multifocal distribution, and therefore aggressive tissue sampling is crucial for diagnosis. Endoscopic ultrasound is essential to document the extent of disease and is more accurate than CT scan in detection of spread to perigastric lymph nodes. Lesions that are confined to the mucosa or submucosa of the gastric wall are believed to be dependent on H. pylori stimulation and therefore can be successfully treated with H. pylori eradication. Those MALT lymphomas that present at more advanced stages require more aggressive management and can be treated with surgical resection, radiation, or chemotherapy. Follow-up is critical in all patients who have been treated with H. pylori eradication and consists of multiple endoscopic biopsies for histological and molecular studies as well as endoscopic ultrasound at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. The reappearance of MALT lymphomas has been seen years after treatment, and therefore follow-up of these patients should be indefinite."

CD009944,0,12772051,0,High interobserver variability in endosonographic staging of upper gastrointestinal cancers.,"Mostly based on results of experienced examiners, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been reported to be highly accurate for locoregional staging of upper gastrointestinal cancers. However, data on interobserver variability among EUS examiners, depending on their experience levels, is sparse. A study was therefore conducted to analyse well-documented videotapes of EUS examinations of 108 patients with resected cancers of the esophagus (n = 55) or stomach (n = 53) in a strictly blinded fashion by 5 examiners, all of whom were experienced in EUS (more than 300 examinations: n = 3, more than 100 examinations: n = 2). Besides the individual accuracy rates in cancer staging, a kappa-statistic was calculated to check for interobserver variability. Under the conditions described, the staging accuracy of all investigators was lower than that usually achieved under clinical routine conditions. The mean T staging accuracy was 41.1 % +/- 9.4 and 46.9 % +/- 5.4 in gastric and esophageal cancers, respectively. For N-staging the respective values were 47.9 % +/- 5.1 (stomach) and 67.7 % +/- 5.4 (oesophagus). Kappa-values were above 0.4 only in the staging of non-invasive esophagogastric tumours of the N0 and T1-category, corresponding to a fairly good agreement among the five investigators. Differences depending on experience levels could not be consistently found. Hence, it can be concluded that endosonographic cancer staging performed in a blinded manner results in a low accuracy and high interobserver variability even among experienced examiners."

CD009944,0,12734683,0,Pathophysiological studies on the relationship between postgastrectomy syndrome and gastric emptying function at 5 years after pylorus-preserving distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer.,"Pylorus-preserving distal gastrectomy (PPG) has frequently been performed on patients with early gastric cancer in Japan to prevent the postgastrectomy syndrome seen after conventional distal gastrectomy (CDG). The long-term postoperative quality of life (QOL) and gastric emptying function in patients after PPG has not been assessed in detail. To clarify the usefulness of PPG for treating early gastric cancer we investigated the relation between postgastrectomy syndrome and gastric emptying function 5 years after PPG and then compared the results with those 5 years after CDG. Altogether, 32 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy at our clinic for early gastric cancer (submucosal cancer without lymph node metastasis) were studied. Ten subjects who underwent PPG with D2 lymphadenectomy without preserving the hepatic and pyloric branches of the vagal nerve [group A: eight men, two women; age 33-70 years (mean 60.7 years)] were interviewed and asked about appetite, weight loss, epigastric fullness, reflux esophagitis, and early dumping syndrome. They were compared with patients after CDG [group B: 36-72 years (mean 63.6 years)]. Esophagogastric endoscopy, abdominal ultrasonography, and gastric emptying function were also studied. The gastric emptying time of a semisolid diet was measured with a radioisotope method using (99m)Tc-labeled rice gruel; the gastric emptying time of a liquid diet was measured with the acetaminophen method using orange juice. The control subjects (group C) consisted of 18 healthy volunteers (10 men, 8 women) without gastrointestinal symptoms aged 38 to 68 years (mean 60.8 years). The following results were obtained: PPG (group A) alleviated postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms such as appetite loss, reflux esophagitis, early dumping syndrome, lost body weight, endoscopic reflux esophagitis, endoscopic gastritis in the remnant stomach, and postogastrectomy cholecystolithiasis better than did CDG (group B). The only weak point with the PPG procedure was that it produced a feeling of epigastric fullness. The pattern of the gastric emptying curve for the semisolid diet was almost the same among groups A, B, and C, although delayed gastric emptying was clearly more frequent in group A than in group B or C ( p < 0.05). Gastric emptying with the liquid diet in group B was significantly faster than that in groups A and C ( p < 0.01). Gastric emptying in groups A and C was similar. These results showed that PPG improved the postoperative QOL, but the delayed emptying of semisolid diet after PPG led to a feeling of epigastric fullness after meals due to retention of contents in the residual stomach. Epigastric fullness after meals continued in many patients after PPG. Thus the only disadvantage of the PPG procedure is the sensation of epigastric fullness and gastric stasis due to delayed gastric emptying of a semisolid diet."

CD009944,0,12544191,0,Endoscopic ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal disorders.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) plays a vital role in management of upper gastrointestinal disorders, particularly cancer of the esophagus, pancreas, stomach, lung (via transesophageal mediastinal staging), and bile duct. Endoscopic ultrasound has also been valuable in detection of early chronic pancreatitis (CP). In cancer of the esophagus, the primary role of EUS is to determine whether disease is localized (T1-2, N0) and appropriate for surgery, locally advanced (T3-4, N1, M1a) (which may benefit from chemoradiation with or without surgery), or metastatic. Pancreatic and bile duct cancers are more complex given the controversy over portal vein resection. In centers that resect tumors invading the portal venous system, the role of EUS is limited to tissue confirmation or identification of metastases to the liver or distant lymph nodes. In centers that do not resect the portal vein invasion, EUS plays an important role in local staging. In lung cancer, EUS is emerging as an accurate, nonsurgical alternative to staging the mediastinum through EUS fine-needle aspiration. Endoscopic ultrasound has an important role in diagnosing CP because of its high degree of sensitivity. This has also led to controversy over whether EUS can overdiagnose CP. For these reasons, we recommend the use of a high threshold for EUS and that CP be diagnosed in conjunction with other standard tests (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, pancreatic function tests)."

But the use of this approach in gastric carcinoma has received little attention, possibly from the low incidence of early-stage disease in the West and the relative complexity of the surgical procedure."
CD009944,0,12510224,0,Diagnosis of esophagogastric tumors.,"It has been suggested that certain histological criteria may serve to indicate a good prognosis in patients with esophageal carcinoma. These include absence of subepithelial extension of the carcinoma cells, stage no higher than m2, and no neoplastic involvement near the resection margin. As endoscopic mucosal resection is becoming an accepted treatment option in this type of tumor, prognostic parameters of this type are of particular interest. By contrast, when metastases are detected in the celiac lymph nodes, it implies that the tumor is unresectable and that palliative treatment is required. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration has been found to be the most cost-effective option in this setting. Although autofluorescence endoscopy is being tested as a new technique for endoscopic diagnosis, its value is at present unclear. However, such developments may lead to improved diagnosis in the future, particularly in relation to the initial stages of carcinoma. For the moment, EUS is still the most widely accepted method for early diagnosis and staging. Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma appears to be commonly associated with head and neck cancer, but the cost-effectiveness of surveillance is a matter of controversy. With regard to Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma, p53 staining in areas of low-grade dysplasia appears to be helpful for predicting progression to high-grade dysplasia. The prevalence of short-segment Barrett's esophagus increases with age, but the length of the segment does not increase with time; the length probably depends on individual conditions, not merely on elapsed time. Helicobacter pylori infection appears to be associated with intestinal metaplasia at the esophagogastric junction. However, the most recent data appear to suggest that this scenario (usually termed ""carditis"") may be different from intestinal metaplasia in the lower esophagus, related to acid reflux. A follow-up program might be able to detect Barrett's esophagus adenocarcinoma at earlier stages, but only a minority of Barrett's esophagus patients are likely to be detected before neoplasia has developed. Gastric cancer appears to develop in individuals with H. pylori infection, but not in uninfected persons. In addition, those with severe gastric atrophy, corpus-predominant gastritis, and intestinal metaplasia may be at greater risk for gastric cancer. This again raises the question of H. pylori eradication in asymptomatic individuals with infection, and surveillance of patients with severe intestinal metaplasia. The most recent data appear to support the notion that healing of MALT lymphoma depends not only on H. pylori eradication and on the stage of the tumor, but also on individual factors (possibly immunology-related)."

CD009944,0,12622429,0,EUS may have limited impact on the endoscopic management of gastric carcinoids.,"Background. Carcinoids are occasionally found during gastroscopy. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) can determine the depth of invasion and vascularity of submucosal tumors, including carcinoid tumors. Thus, EUS can lead to an informed decision as to whether to attempt endoscopic or surgical excision of a carcinoid. The three cases described here were found by EUS to be amenable to endoscopic resection of submucosal carcinoid tumors. In each case, the margin of the specimen obtained led to uncertainty regarding the completeness of gastroscopic excision of the tumor. Guidelines for follow-up of gastric carcinoid are few. The incompleteness of endoscopic resection of submucosal tumors, with tumor found at the specimen margin, indicates that careful follow-up and/or consideration of other means of excision are indicated."

The provision of an ultrasound probe on a flexible gastrointestinal endoscope, to form an echoendoscope, provides excellent imaging of the gastrointestinal wall and of adjacent extramural structures.

CD009944,0,12499740,0,Is there additional information from laparoscopic ultrasound in tumor staging?,"Accurate preoperative staging of gastrointestinal malignancies is of major importance in the decision for adequate stage-related therapy. There is evidence that laparoscopy in combination with laparoscopic ultrasound is more accurate in the detection of intra-abdominal metastases than conventional preoperative imaging. Staging laparoscopy in combination with laparoscopic ultrasound is a minimally invasive technique that reveals intra-abdominal disseminated tumor spread and local tumor extent. Therefore laparoscopic ultrasound is an ideal adjunct to laparoscopy because this technique may compensate for the lack of tactile feedback with laparoscopic instruments. Color-coded Doppler imaging can be very valuable for the assessment of resectability in patients with pancreatic cancer. Current data confirm that laparoscopic ultrasound is capable of enhancing the accuracy of staging laparoscopy. Compared to standard laparoscopy, a combination of both techniques markedly increases the sensitivity of staging laparoscopy in the determination of unresectable disease. This is of major importance in the assessment of occult liver metastases and lymph node involvement. Laparoscopic ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional imaging techniques and should be considered as integral part of staging laparoscopy."

Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) is currently the most sensitive modality for the detection of small hepatic lesions. However, IOUS is invasive requiring laparoscopy or formal laparotomy. We sought to evaluate the feasibility of using endoscopic ultrasonograhpy (EUS) for the detection and diagnosis of hepatic masses in patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCCA) and metastatic lesions (ML). We hypothesized that EUS could detect small (<1.0 cm) hepatic lesions undetectable by CT scan and could be used for biopsy of deep-seated hepatic lesions."

The most noteworthy of the EUS applications are for cancer staging; including rectal, pancreatic, lung, and esophageal malignancies. There is little doubt that EUS is a powerful tool for cancer imaging, but its clinical impact in patient care and management has yet to be validated in prospective outcome studies. Other imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET), dual-phased helical CT, and MR imaging technology will undoubtedly provide increasingly accurate diagnostic and staging information for gastrointestinal diseases. EUS imaging alone may assume a less significant role in relation to these noninvasive modalities in the future. EUS-guided FNA, as well as therapeutic EUS applications, will likely continue to expand in scope and play an important role in clinical medicine for many years to come."

The expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and E-cadherin were examined by a colorimetric in situ mRNA hybridization technique. The integrity of the mRNAs was verified, leaving 161 (85.2%) patients for study. After gastrectomy, 82 patients had positive lymph nodes and 79 patients had negative lymph nodes. The concurrent expression levels of MMP-2 and E-cadherin mRNAs were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the metastatic tumors than the non-metastatic tumors. Expression of EGF-R and VEGF was not different between the metastatic and non-metastatic tumors. However, when only the intestinal-type of gastric cancer was evaluated, the level of VEGF mRNA was significantly higher in tumors associated with lymph node metastasis than in those without metastasis. However, a high MMP-2:E-cadherin ratio significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis in both types of gastric cancer. These results suggest that multiparametric in situ hybridization analysis for several metastasis-related genes may allow the preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis from gastric cancer."

Cure rates (5-year survival) of greater than 10% have been achieved even for unresectable disease. Obstructive jaundice is managed successfully with endoscopic placement of a plastic stent early in the evaluation of a patient with suspected regional pancreatic cancer, and a metal wall stent is reserved for patients with known 1997 AJCC stage IVB carcinoma or nonoperative patients. Relief of biliary obstruction allows improvement in liver function and more time to evaluate tumor stage accurately to determine initial treatment (see Fig. 1). A cost-effective algorithm to determine accurate stage and treatment can start with the size of the mass on initial imaging studies. EUS-guided FNA represents a significant improvement over CT scan-guided FNA to make a tissue diagnosis. Small pancreatic masses that would be resected regardless of whether an FNA is positive or negative require only an EUS evaluation to establish an early resectable stage. Tumors reliably staged as unresectable by nonoperative imaging methods including EUS are treated with chemotherapy with or without concurrent radiotherapy because median survival of these patients is 2 years in some series. Tumors can be resected after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. For chronic pain or gastric outlet obstruction not responding or treatable by chemoradiotherapy, endoscopically guided celiac plexus nerve block and stenting improve the quality of life for patients with pancreatic cancer. A team approach is required to achieve the objectives of improved quality of life, prolonged survival, and possible cure for pancreatic cancer. The optimal combination and sequencing of staging methods, including EUS, specialized CT scan, MR imaging, intraoperative findings, and pathologic evaluations, would improve selection of patients for potential curative resection. Interpretations of disease stage based on each of these methods may overlap but are not identical and are operator dependent.

Twenty-two patients were entered into the study (4 with T3N0 disease and 18 with T3N1 disease). Induction chemotherapy was well tolerated with major toxicities being neutropenia and diarrhea. A median of 78%/75% of the planned dosage of CPT-11/cisplatin was delivered. Two patients withdrew consent during the first cycle and were lost to follow-up. One patient progressed to stage IV disease during induction chemotherapy and did not undergo surgery. Nineteen patients underwent surgery. One patient had undetected stage IV disease (liver) and underwent a palliative R2 resection. Of the 18 remaining patients, 17 had curative R0 resections and one had a palliative R1 resection. A median of 21 lymph nodes (range 1 to 121) were examined histologically. There was one postoperative death. Surgical morbidity did not appear to increase after the neoadjuvant regimen. The median postoperative length of hospital stay was 9 days (range 3 to 75 days). Postoperative pathologic staging yielded 16% T3 lesions compared to 85% before treatment based on clinical staging; postoperative American Joint Committee on Cancer staging yielded 37% stage IIIA disease compared to 70% stage IIIA before treatment. With a median follow-up of 15 months, median survival has not yet been reached. We conclude that CPT-11-based neoadjuvant therapy downstages locally advanced gastric cancer. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the ultimate impact of this combination therapy on recurrence and survival."
CD009944,0,11989843,0,Diagnosis of a gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biopsies in a patient with a parotid gland localization.,"We report the case of a 32-year-old man with a low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the parotid gland associated with Sjögren syndrome. He underwent an upper endoscopy as part of the screening of a gastric localization which showed a diffuse non-specific gastritis. However, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) evidenced a focal wall thickening of the vertical portion of the smaller curvature. EUS-guided biopsies of this area disclosed a MALT lymphoma, whereas biopsies under endoscopy concluded to mild chronic gastritis. The search for Helicobacter pylori infection remained negative. Four months after treatment with anti-CD20 antibodies, EUS showed a diminution of the abnormal thickening of the second layer. Regression was confirmed histologically on new EUS-guided biopsies. MALT lymphoma is usually considered a localized disease; however, dissemination is probably more frequent than initially believed. Our case reflects the importance of a systematic screening for a gastric localization in patients with MALT lymphoma of the salivary glands. In this situation, association to autoimmune disease such as Sjögren syndrome is more likely to explain the gastric location than infection with H. pylori. Endoscopic ultrasonography has a major impact for the staging of gastric MALT lymphoma, but may also help diagnose focal infiltration by the disease."

CD009944,0,11831609,0,Endoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer.,"Patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of a pancreatic neoplasm typically undergo initial imaging with transabdominal ultrasound or computed tomography. This evaluation often reveals the presence of a pancreatic mass or fullness. At times, the nature of the lesion is poorly characterized, with uncertainty remaining as to whether the lesion is an inflammatory mass or a neoplasm, and if it is cystic or solid. In these circumstances, endoscopic procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and/or endoscopic ultrasound may be required. These procedures offer other means of tissue sampling, disease staging, and an option for palliative therapy. In this article, we review the role of endoscopy for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic tumors, with a particular focus on endoscopic ultrasound."

CD009944,0,11778127,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography.,"Over the past two decades, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has undergone a transition from being a novel imaging technique to a clinical diagnostic test that is necessary for the optimal management of gastrointestinal diseases. EUS has established itself as an important diagnostic modality, mainly for the detection and staging of gastrointestinal cancers. As EUS has become more widespread, research has gradually shifted towards studies that explore the effect of EUS on patient management and outcome. These outcome studies have examined the primary clinical applications of EUS, such as esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer staging, as well as the role of EUS in the diagnosis of inflammatory pancreatic diseases. Widespread use of EUS has recently led to studies that examine complications associated with the performance of the procedure. Endosonographers have continued efforts to define a clinical role for EUS in other gastrointestinal diseases, such as portal hypertension. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is continuing to develop into a powerful diagnostic tool for the management of lung cancer and other mediastinal diseases. New applications for EUS-FNA are also emerging. Finally, investigators are continuing to explore the remaining frontier of EUS-guided therapy."
CD009944,0,11869324,0,Prognostic value of laparoscopic ultrasound in patients with gastro-esophageal cancer.,"Forty-four patients with gastro-esophageal tumors regarded as resectable by conventional staging underwent laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS). Following LUS, seven were found to be irresectable and were managed by palliative therapies. Thirty-seven patients proceeded to surgical exploration and 36 were resected (R0 80%, R1 11%, and R2 9%). All patients were reviewed until death or for a minimum of 24 months. Patients undergoing resection had a 62% 1-year survival (median 17 months; confidence intervals, CI 6-28). LUS defined nodal status indicated a trend toward prolonged survival in the node-negative group, median 22 months (CI 5-39), compared with 13 months (CI 6-20) in the node-positive group. Disease-free survival was greater in LUS node-negative patients at 29 months (CI 23-35) compared with node-positive patients at 13 months (CI 5-21) P=0.0083. LUS staging allows prediction of the likelihood of recurrence of gastro-esophageal malignancies. This may prove useful for the appropriate allocation of patients to primary and adjuvant therapies."
CD009944,0,11817475,0,Imaging features of pancreatic neoplasms.,"Pancreatic masses are common in daily imaging practice. The advent of helical CT and breathold MRI has provided a new impetus to the study of the pancreas not only for the potential of characterizing pancreatic masses and pancreatitis but also because of the more accurate staging of pancreatic neoplasms using this technique. Pancreatic tumors are classified according to its histologic origin. Ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common. Regarding ductal adenocarcinoma, despite the fast evolving imaging techniques promising an earlier diagnosis and an accurate staging, still the prognosis is extremely poor. However, new surgical data indicate that long-term survival although rare, occurs on resected tumors less than 2 cm, without vascular encasement or adenopathy. Logically, early detection and accurate staging of tumors has become the main focussing in pancreatic imaging since it may result in an increase in the survival of these patients. In this context, the role of imaging to identify, characterize and stage pancreatic neoplasms will be described. Furthermore, the key radiological features of a gamut of more uncommon pancreatic neoplasms will be illustrated. These include other exocrine epithelial tumors (anaplastic carcinoma, pancreatoblastoma, acinar cell carcinoma serous cystic pancreatic adenoma, mucinous cystic tumors, intraductal mucinous papillary tumor, and solid pseudopapillary neoplasm), endocrine tumors or islet cell tumors (insulinoma, gastrinoma, gluconoma, vipoma, non-functioning tumors), rare non-epithelial tumors (lymphoma, teratoma) and metastases to the pancreas."
CD009944,0,11816140,0,[Esophageal implantation metastasis from adenocarcinoma of the cardia].,"A 74 years old male patient was admitted to our department suffering from dysphagia for five months. Gastric Barium studies showed a cardia tumour with polypoid lesions in the wall of the esophagus, and gastro-esophageal reflux disease was also diagnosed. Endoscopy verified a cardia tumour with esophageal metastasis, and biopsy was obtained from the two lesions. Histology showed that both tumours were adenocarcinomas. Endoscopic ultrasonography classified the cardia tumour as grade T2. As observed during endoscopy, the wall of the esophagus at the level of the polypoid lesion was hypo-echogenic and thick which was result of thickened mucosa. Total gastrectomy and oesophagectomy was performed. Pathology showed that the cardia tumour was pT2N2 and type Siewert-Stein II. The esophageal polypoid lesion was also proved an adenocarcinoma, which was localized only to the mucosa. No tumour cells were found in the blood- or in lymph vessels between the tumour and the esophageal adenocarcinoma. We think that the polypoid adenocarcinoma in the esophagus is an esophageal metastasis implantation from the cardia adenocarcinoma. It is based on the exclusion of other possible tumour dissemination routes. Probably the gastro-esophageal reflux is responsible for the implantation of tumour cells."

CD009944,0,11753234,0,[Morphological imaging of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours].,"Biologically active neuroendocrine tumours produce early symptoms and are often difficult to diagnose owing to their small dimensions (<1 cm), whereas biologically inactive forms are often coarse and sometimes found by chance. As well as identifying the lesion, locoregional staging is also particularly important for therapeutic planning. Morphological imaging plays an important role in the identification of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, providing an anatomic substrate for receptorial imaging which usually precede it in the diagnostic work-up, whereas it plays a primary role in the locoregional staging of these neoplasms for which surgery is the first and essential therapeutic approach. In the case of endocrine tumours of the pancreas alone, the most accurate method of diagnosis is currently echo-endoscopy using high-frequency probes. Two-phase spiral CT and dynamic MR have proved equally effective means of identifying endocrine tumours of the pancreas with slightly higher sensitivity for MR, both playing a role in the locoregional staging of biologically active and inactive tumours. Traditional radiology also plays a role in the identification of intestinal carcinoids."
CD009944,0,11750230,0,Cancer of the esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction: potentially curative therapies.,"The definition of potential curative tumors of the esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction remains problematic. This is due to a lack of accuracy in clinical staging despite recent advances in CT, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), positron emission tomography scan and minimally invasive staging modalities. As a result much controversy persists regarding indications for surgery and extent of resection and lymphadenectomy. Today surgery with curative option results in five-year survival of over 30%. Multimodality regimens, especially neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, seem to be beneficial in patients with a complete response on pathologic staging. Other indications are investigational and should be studied within carefully monitored study protocols. In early carcinoma T(is)-T(1a) endoluminal ablation technique seem to open promising perspectives provided of discrimination between T(is)-T(1a) and T(1b) can be made by the use of 20mhz EUS probes."

This study evaluated the efficacy and accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) -guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy in the diagnosis of GIST and reported its cytomorphologic features. Twelve patients with gastric GIST were diagnosed through EUS-guided FNA. Immediate on-site evaluation and cytologic diagnoses were given in nine cases (75.0%) with an average of three passes. Cell blocks provided diagnostic material in three cases (25.0%). Spindle cells were present in the cytologic material in all cases. Two patients had subsequent surgical resections. Immunohistochemical (IHC) studies performed in cell blocks and two surgical specimens all supported the original diagnoses. In the two cases with surgical resections, IHC results in cell blocks were similar to that in the resected specimens. This study demonstrated that when combining smears and cell blocks, EUS-guided FNA is accurate and efficient in the diagnosis of GIST.

CD009944,0,11641096,0,Optimizing treatment of carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction.,"Overall prognosis in patients with carcinoma of the esophagus and Gastroesophageal junction remains poor mainly because of the late presentation and advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Over the last decades, clinical staging has improved, especially since the introduction of CT scan and echo-endoscopy; however, the clinical definition of potential curative tumors still remains unsatisfactory. More recently, the introduction of PET scanning seems to offer better perspective for more precise staging and evaluation of response. In centers with large experience, cure rates today are exceeding 30% after primary surgery. To improve the cure rate, much attention is paid to neoadjuvant multimodality regimens. In resectable tumors, induction therapy offers little or no benefit. In locally advanced tumors especially, the combination of induction chemoradiotherapy results in a complete response in a substantial number of patients. This subset of patients seems to benefit in terms of survival and cure, whereas the others do not. Future research, therefore, needs to focus on early identification of responders (e.g., through molecular biology) and new chemotherapeutic drugs with higher impact on tumor response and fewer side effects."

Malignant variety represents about 2.0% of malignant gastroenteric tumours. The Authors report a clinical case of malignant gastric and duodenojejunal GIST, in which the only surgical treatment seems to be definitive. R. S., a 69-year-old female, was admitted for asthenia and fever in January 1997. Endoscopic exploration, ultrasonography and CT-scan of the abdomen demonstrated an exophytic tumour in the greater gastric curvature and one tumour of 5.5 cm of diameter in the Treitz's angle. We performed a resection of the gastric tumour and the duodenojejunal angle. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after 14 postoperative hospital days. Histological analysis showed two spindle cells stromal tumours with mitotic rate > 20/10 HPF. The immunohistochemistry demonstrated the uncommitted origin of tumour cells. The patient refused the chemotherapy treatment. There was no local recurrence or metastasis at a follow up of 47 months, in spite the high malignancy degree. For this reason and because of the uncertain behaviour of benign GIST, the authors propose a lifelong follow up of the patients managed with potentially curative surgical resection."

Recent studies have shown that GISTs are immunophenotypically and genetically distinct. GISTs exhibit consistent immunohistochemical expression of CD-117 (KIT) and often express activating mutations of this protooncogene.

CD009944,0,11464493,0,Staging laparoscopy for gastric cancer.,"The growing role of multimodal treatment plans for advanced gastric cancer has contributed to the development of more accurate preoperative staging strategies. The high diagnostic efficacy of video-laparoscopy as regards the M factor has been reported by many; preoperative laparoscopy therefore permits to avoid unhelpful surgical exploration in case of peritoneal dissemination of tumor or liver metastases undetected by conventional staging. At Memorial Sloan Kattering Cancer Center preoperative staging laparoscopy is currently included in the diagnostic algorithm for gastric cancer. Data from a consecutive series of 103 patients demonstrated metastatic disease in 24 patients (37%) who were considered to have localized cancer by computed tomography (CT) or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), with an accuracy of 94% with respect to the M factor. These patients did not require open surgery. Laparoscopic washings were obtained from 127 patients with gastric cancer and a positive correlation between the extent of disease and prevalence of positive cytology was noted (T1/T2: 0%, T3/T4: 10%, M+: 59%). Our experience suggests that laparoscopy has added value in staging patients with gastric carcinoma. It appears to be a safe and effective staging modality, avoiding unnecessary explorations and providing new means of directing appropriate treatment strategy."
CD009944,0,11459275,0,The Mayo clinic approach to the surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.,"Ductal carcinoma of the pancreas remains a challenging problem for gastrointestinal surgeons. Significant progress has been made in diagnosis, preoperative staging, and safety of surgery; however, long-term survival after resection is unusual, and cure is rare. That said, the authors maintain their aggressive posture regarding this disease, recognizing that resection offers the only potential for cure. The authors' approach such patients in the most efficient and least invasive manner possible, relying primarily on triple phase helical abdominal CT for clinical diagnosis and staging, reserving ERCP and EUS for diagnostic dilemmas. In fit candidates with potentially resectable lesions, the authors eschew pre- or intraoperative biopsy, angiography, or endoscopic stenting and use preliminary limited staging laparoscopy selectively. Surgical palliation is chosen for fit patients who, at exploration for potentially curative resection, are found to have occult distant metastases or locally unresectable disease. Radical pancreatoduodenectomy can be performed with a mortality rate of 3% or less, and although morbidity remains significant, most can be managed with conservative measures. Quality of life after pancreatoduodenectomy is good and, if not, is generally a manifestation of recurrence rather than physiologic alterations inherent to the procedure. Adjuvant chemoradiation is standard therapy after resection, recommended for those with locally unresectable disease but used selectively for those with distant metastasis. Survival after potentially curative resection has remained disappointing. Whether extended lymphadenectomy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation improves survival has not been determined. Clearly, methods for earlier diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and more effective adjuvant therapies are sorely needed."
CD009944,0,11451144,0,Endoscopic ultrasound in the evaluation and treatment of chronic pancreatitis.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was developed in the 1970s specifically for the purpose of improved imaging of the pancreas. The close proximity of the pancreas to the gastric and duodenal lumen allows EUS to obtain high-resolution images, unobstructed by overlying bowel gas. EUS has fewer complications than endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and can detect features of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in the pancreatic parenchyma and duct that are not visible to any other imaging modality. Because of this high sensitivity, questions have arisen whether EUS is oversensitive, especially to ''early"" CP. Without a definitive gold standard against which to measure EUS (or ERCP and function testing), it is currently not possible to know the true accuracy of these modalities for early CP. There is now an extensive body of literature suggesting that these early changes detected by EUS correlate with histologic changes of CP, and may predict response to pancreatic therapy. EUS is uniquely suited to performing endoscopic cyst drainage for pancreatic pseudocysts and for controlling the pain of CP by EUS-directed celiac plexus block. For endoscopic cystenterostomy, EUS allows the endoscopist to localize the cyst, determine if the cyst is drainable, and guide a needle and stent into the cyst in a single step. Several major questions remain. Can EUS features of CP guide other forms of therapy for CP such as enzyme replacement, sphincter of Oddi therapy, and stent therapy? Can the detection of early CP by EUS, and subsequent therapy, delay or prevent the onset of more severe CP? Can EUS detect early forms for dysplasia and malignancy in patients who are at high risk for pancreatic carcinoma? Do changes of ""early"" CP detected by EUS progress to more classic changes (calicification) over time?"

CD009944,0,11432306,0,Gastrointestinal tract cancer in the elderly.,"Gastrointestinal cancers are common in the elderly. In the 1990s, modest advances in the early diagnosis, staging, and treatment of gastrointestinal cancers were made. Emphasis has been placed on screening for colorectal cancer; development of new diagnostic and staging modalities, particularly endoscopic ultrasound; and introduction of new treatment regimens, such as chemoradiation programs for esophageal, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers as well as endoscopic mucosal resection of early gastrointestinal cancers. New palliative techniques, such as laser and photodynamic therapy and placement of enteral stents, are being used increasingly in patients who have advanced cancer and are not surgical candidates. In the past, attitudes toward the elderly affected the management of cancer. Age should not be the only parameter considered when addressing the treatment of a gastrointestinal malignancy. Management decisions in the elderly should follow the same principles as those in younger patients. A thorough medical evaluation in the elderly is necessary to evaluate the patient's risk and to optimize surgical, chemotherapeutic, and palliative outcomes."

Angiography, computed tomography (CT) angiography and EUS are similarly accurate in evaluating peripancreatic vascular involvement. MRI is the superior method for detecting liver metastases and peritoneal implants of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are used to assess the biliary tract of patients with pancreatic cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful in distinguishing pancreatic cancer from focal pancreatic inflammation."

On gastrofiberscopy a submucosal tumor covered with smooth transparent normal mucosa is revealed in the stomach with or without a stalk. Endoscopic ultrasonography has become an indispensable tool for differentiating these gastric tumors. Treatment of lymphangioma depends on its size, location, and presence of complications. Endoscopic resection is safe and easy and plays an important role in confirming the diagnosis and treatment of the tumors especially of small-sized ones.

At the current presentation, she had been experiencing progressive epigastric discomfort for 3 months. The initial diagnosis was early gastric carcinoma, diffuse type, based on gastric biopsy findings and ultrasonographic endoscopy. A definitive diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer was confirmed after subtotal gastrectomy of a presumed primary early gastric carcinoma.

In recent years, the interest of gastroenterologists in this method has revived, since laparoscopy can provide additional information for the staging of oncological and liver diseases. The introduction of miniature lenses may have contributed to this process, and an increasing number of physicians are using minilaparoscopy due to its safety and easy handling. Surgical studies have mainly focused on the evaluation of laparoscopic ultrasound for the detection of liver and lymph-node metastases. In specialized centers, laparoscopic ultrasound is also used for the estimation of locoregional pancreatic tumor spread, but the diagnostic impact of the method, particularly in colorectal carcinoma, still remains to be determined. Remarkably, the number of publications from gastroenterology departments has tended to increase in comparison with last year's review."
CD009944,0,11204980,0,Diagnosis of esophagogastric tumors.,"The incidence of esophageal tumors, and of adenocarcinoma in particular, has risen markedly in recent years in the developed countries. The use of a variety of histopathological and biological markers is now offering promising prospects for the future. Vertical tumor invasion, intratumoral microvessel density, antimucin monoclonal antibodies, flow cytometry, telomerase activity, and overexpression of cyclin D1 have been correlated with the staging and prognosis of esophageal carcinomas. By combining these markers with Lugol staining, a practical new method of staging esophageal tumors may become available in the coming years. As is well known, Barrett's mucosa is a preneoplastic condition. Discussions in the literature concerning short forms of Barrett's esophagus and their relationship to inflammation of the gastric cardia appear to describe two different scenarios--a gastroesophageal reflux condition for short forms of Barrett's esophagus, and an inflammatory phenomenon (perhaps unrelated to Helicobacter pylori infection) for inflammation of the gastric cardia. Cost-benefit studies of follow-up procedures in Barrett's esophagus have yet to be conducted, and considerable efforts--mainly using biological markers--are being made to identify those patients who are at greatest risk. Although the frequency of gastric tumors has declined in recent years, many as yet unclear aspects of these tumors have been studied. Technological progress has not led to substantial changes in the diagnostic procedures used, although autofluorescence methods and three-dimensional reconstruction have been analyzed. Laparoscopy, preferably combined with the use of ultrasound probes, may be a valuable tool for staging. The suggestion that endoscopy should be avoided in young patients (the ""treat but do not scope"" approach) has been seriously questioned, as it may lead to early cancer being overlooked. There is thought to be an intermediate stage of gastric cancer (between the early and advanced stages) in which the muscularis propria, but not the serosa, is invaded. Endoscopic ultrasonography is becoming increasingly established as a basic tool for the staging of gastric cancer. Gastric MALT lymphoma can be cured by H. pylori eradication therapy in many cases, but there is still uncertainty regarding the limitations of this approach."

In addition, secondary achalasia should be suspected in patients who do not respond to therapy with botulinum toxin within 2 months. Because none of the mentioned tests can distinguish between primary achalasia and secondary forms due to carcinoma of the cardia, biopsy specimens should be obtained. It appears that, although there is a minimal risk for complications, a diagnostic procedure such as biopsy would be appropriate when the information obtained could be essential. In some cases EUS can be an additional diagnostic tool, because lesions of the submucosa and the surrounding area can be identified by EUS."

In this study, we evaluate our treatment strategy by reviewing the patients prospectively undergoing modified D1 lymphadenectomy. The clinicopathological characteristics and survival data of 138 patients who underwent modified D1 lymphadenectomy between 1987--when we first introduced endoscopic ultrasonography--and 1996 were analyzed. The criteria for modified D1 lymphadenectomy were mucosal, node negative gastric cancer by pre-operative and intra-operative examinations. Depth of invasion was correctly diagnosed in 80% of the patients. Among the resultant submucosal gastric cancer patients, the incidence of slight submucosal invasion was increased in the second half-period (78%) as compared with that in the first half-period (44%). Nodal involvement was observed in 4 patients (2.9%); all of them exhibited the depressed type with ulceration and a histologically high grade of gastric cancer. Because their metastasized lymph nodes were all confined to the perigastric region, surgical treatment resulted in no residual cancer macroscopically. No patients succumbed to gastric cancer within the median and mean follow-up periods of over 6 years. These results suggest that our modified D1 lymphadenectomy is an effective option for the pre-operatively and intra-operatively diagnosed mucosal, node negative gastric cancer which meets our criteria."

It is concluded that endoscopic ultrasound is more reliable for preoperative staging than conventional ultrasound, computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging for gastric cancer.

CD009944,0,11077579,0,[Combined laparoscopic-endoscopic procedure in stomach carcinoma].,"The purpose of this review is to outline the laparoscopic-endoscopic procedures that we perform for early gastric cancer. These procedures were applied to 29 patients. Preoperative work-up included gastric endoscopy, barium X-ray examination, endoscopic ultrasonography, and histological examination, and surgery was performed in patients diagnosed as having mucosal gastric cancer for which endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was difficult. Laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach using the lesion-lifting method, by which a wedge resection is made while pulling up the full-thickness gastric wall, was carried out in the 16 patients with lesions of the anterior wall, lesser curvature, and greater curvature of the stomach. On pathological examination of resected specimens, the surgical margin and lymphatic or venous invasion were negative in all these patients. The histological depth of the lesions was m (mucosal cancer) in 15 patients and sm1 (slight cancer infiltration into the submucosal layer) in one. This one patient later underwent gastrectomy but no lymph node metastases were found. Oral nutrition was resumed for a mean (+/- SD) of 2.9 +/- 0.8 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.3 +/- 3.4 days. The 13 patients with lesions of the posterior wall of the stomach and near the cardia or the pylorus received laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection. Laparotomy was required in 1 of these patients due to intraoperative hemorrhage. The surgical margins were negative in all 12 patients in whom laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection was successful. Lymphatic or venous invasion was positive in 2, both of whom had sm1 cancer lesions of both of these patients were located in the cardiac region, total gastrectomy was avoided, and careful observation is continued. Oral nutrition was resumed 4.0 +/- 1.6 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.0 +/- 3.5 days. In addition, no postoperative complication was noted after either procedure, and all patients have been recurrence free for a follow-up period of 460 months. Selected properly, these laparoscopic endoscopic procedures are considered to be curative and minimally invasive treatments for early gastric cancer."

CD009944,0,11030075,0,Malignant tumors of the stomach. Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and Helicobacter pylori.,"With the help of many clinical studies, the diagnosis and therapy of gastric MALT lymphoma have evolved. Major progress has been seen in this area, including improvement of biopsy diagnosis, better histologic classification, new information concerning pathogenesis, and, especially, the start of a revolution in the treatment of low-grade gastric MALT lymphomas by eradicating H. pylori. About 12 clinical studies with almost 400 patients and case reports have shown that cure of H. pylori infection is associated with complete remission in approximately 80% of patients with low-grade MALT lymphoma in an early clinical stage. To establish H. pylori eradication as the primary choice in low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma further, it is necessary to select patients before therapy who are most likely to benefit from this single treatment modality. An excellent histologic workup of obtained biopsy specimens and comprehensive clinical staging are necessary. Because of the supposition that H. pylori-related growth support may play a role only in the early stages of low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma, the importance of determining the depth of lymphoma infiltration in the gastric wall is evident. Examinations by endosonographic ultrasonography have been shown to be the most reliable method to differentiate the layers of the gastric wall and to determine the infiltration depth of lymphomas. Eradication of H. pylori has to be considered as a first-line and single treatment modality in patients with low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma in clinical stage EI1. As a therapy with fewer side effects than radiation, surgery, or chemotherapy and as a stomach-conserving treatment, eradication of H. pylori in patients with low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma should be the treatment of the choice within clinical trials because there are no long-term results available thus far. Besides pretreatment patient selection, careful follow-up with endoscopy, biopsies, and clinical staging including endoscopic ultrasonography is necessary. A 5- to 10-year follow-up is necessary before the definitive value of H. pylori eradication can be established, but long-term results are excellent thus far. There are many questions to be addressed: What are the exact mechanisms that lead to the malignant transformation of a reactive infiltrate? Why do approximately 20% of low-grade MALT lymphomas not regress after H. pylori eradication? Is there a molecular-genetic or immunologic point of no return? What is the biologic significance of the immunoglobulin rearrangement detected with PCR? What will be the 5- and 10-year relapse-free survival rates of patients suffering from low-grade MALT lymphoma treated with H. pylori eradication alone as first and only treatment? The wave of new data each year about the role of H. pylori in gastric MALT lymphoma may help many of these questions to be answered."

Gastrinomas and insulinomas are the two most common pancreatic endocrine tumors. Unlike pancreatic adenocarcinoma, in which tumor stage, resectability, and prognosis are determined by the tumor, nodes, and metastasis (TNM) classification, the prognosis of pancreatic endocrine tumors is determined by the presence of liver but not regional lymph node metastasis. This review focuses predominantly on the different diagnostic tools available to the clinician and the relative merits of each modality.

CD009944,0,10967752,0,Surgical staging of esophageal cancer.,"The rising incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the poor overall 5-year survival using current treatment regimens make it essential that clinical trials continue to search for more effective regimens for specific stages of esophageal cancer. It is clear from work in non-small cell lung cancer that clinical efficacy for platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens has shown promise only in specific subsets of patients, such as those with stage IIIa tumors, but no benefit at all for earlier stages. In lung cancer, mediastinoscopy has been shown to be the most accurate method to stage locoregional lymph nodes and is considered to be the gold standard for clinical trials. In esophageal cancer, accurate surgical staging of all locoregional lymph nodes is more complex and may involve abdominal, thoracic, and cervical areas. Molecular evidence of lymph node involvement in esophageal cancer suggests that even histologically negative nodes may harbor micrometastases in a significant number of cases. Laparoscopy and thoracoscopy now offer a more accurate alternative to conventional staging of esophageal cancer. For distal esophageal cancers near the gastroesophageal junction, laparoscopic staging alone may suffice in most cases. Associated costs and the requirement for a surgical procedure should encourage the continued evaluation of new noninvasive modalities and the further evolution of endoscopic ultrasound. Currently, we recommend the application of minimally invasive surgical staging to assess new noninvasive technologies, such as PET scanning, and for use in clinical trials until the definitive approach to staging esophageal cancer is established. We are currently participating in an ongoing multicenter study of thoracoscopic and laparoscopic staging for esophageal cancer."

A control ultrasonographic examinations demonstrated the normal five layers structure of the gastric wall without any alteration. In our patient Helicobacter pylori eradication was an effective therapy for gastric MALT lymphoma as well. Our results similar as are published in the literature.

To determine reliable indications suggesting submucosal tumor invasion, we retrospectively analyzed EUS images of the hyperechoic third layer, which corresponds to the submucosa. The subjects enrolled in this study were 75 patients, with 78 gastric cancers (diagnosed as mucosal cancer without ulcerous changes on endoscopy and as histologically differentiated adenocarcinoma on biopsy), who were also examined by EUS. We retrospectively classified EUS features of the third layer (submucosa) into five groups: (1) irregular narrowing, (2) budding sign, (3) multiple echo-free spots, (4) unclear, and (5) no changes. In endoscopically diagnosed gastric mucosal cancer, 16 of the 78 lesions were associated with histologic submucosal invasion. EUS features that were associated with a high incidence of histological submucosal tumor invasion were irregular narrowing (submucosal invasion, 60.0%) and the budding sign (85.7%), and 90.9% of lesions with either of these features had submucosal invasion of tumors when tumorous changes in the third layer exceeded 1 mm in depth. Endosonographic irregular narrowing and a budding sign of more than 1 mm in depth in the third layer are useful for the diagnosis of submucosal invasion in gastric cancers that are diagnosed as mucosal cancers without ulcerous change on endoscopy."

No regression was found in five cases after 12-48 months. In one case surgical resection detected the involvement of perigastric lymph nodes overlooked by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Neither progression of the disease nor a high-grade component was documented by repeated gastric mappings, EUS and complete stagings in the other four cases. After histological remission five relapses of low-grade and one relapse of high-grade MALT lymphoma were found 12-48 months after eradication. Subsequent histological remission, without any additional therapy, was found in three relapsed cases. A rapid and persistent histological remission was obtained in 56 patients (73%). A late remission was observed in six cases. Monoclonal remission was found in half of the patients and was frequently delayed. Persistent monoclonality was associated with histological remission in the vast majority of patients. Our data confirm H. pylori eradication as the first choice therapy for early stage gastric low-grade MALT lymphoma and recommend extensive bioptic mapping and endoscopic sonography both in the local staging and in the regression evaluation. The rare cases of late remission encourage us to wait for at least 1 year after eradication of H. pylori. Longer follow-up studies will clarify the meaning of histological relapse/persistence and late remission. The study of non-responder cases could show us a step in lymphomagenesis."

Any diagnostic uncertainty of clinical staging may have potentially important therapeutic implications, especially if a non-surgical approach is favored. Diagnostic procedures for evaluation of gastric lymphoma include gastrointestinal endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound of the upper gastrointestinal tract, conventional abdominal and cervical ultrasound, thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans and bone marrow biopsy. In the present overview, the value of clinical diagnostic procedures is discussed with respect to clinical and endoscopic criteria which may be helpful for evaluation of gastric NHL. Furthermore, clinical staging methods such as endoscopic ultrasound are assessed which may allow pre-operative determination of tumor and lymph-node stage. These novel approaches are compared with the gold standard of pathohistological analysis. In conclusion, the diagnostic procedures presented appear to be helpful for establishing an early diagnosis, however, innovative methods such as endoscopic-bioptic mapping of the stomach and ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy techniques may improve pre-therapeutical work-up."
CD009944,0,10777153,0,Recent advances in endoscopic ultrasonography.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography is recognized as an important tool in the diagnosis and staging of esophageal, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and biliary tumors. It also is a reliable method for the evaluation of submucosal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, the differentiation between benign and malignant giant gastric folds, the evaluation of gastric ulcer healing, and the detection of common bile duct stones. The recent introduction of endoscopic ultrasonographic fine-needle aspiration provides for the cytologic and histologic diagnosis of gastrointestinal submucosal and extraluminal tumors and regional lymph nodes. This new technique may also be used for the intrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin in the treatment of achalasia, for the steroid injection treatment of refractory esophageal strictures, for celiac nerve block, for pseudocyst drainage, and for drug delivery into pancreatic tumors. High-frequency thin ultrasonic probes can be used to make a more accurate diagnosis of superficial carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract and for intraductal ultrasonography of the extrahepatic bile duct and pancreatic duct. In the future, three-dimensional imaging of gastrointestinal tumors will provide more accurate information regarding cancer extent. Endoscopic ultrasonography is a powerful tool which can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal diseases."
CD009944,0,10776880,0,Laparoscopic ultrasound enhances diagnostic laparoscopy in the staging of intra-abdominal neoplasms.,"Routine laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) for staging intra-abdominal malignancies remains controversial. Thus, we undertook a prospective study to assess the value of preoperative laparoscopy with LUS for patients with intra-abdominal tumors judged resectable by preoperative studies. Laparoscopy was successfully performed in 76 of 77 patients, and 60 underwent LUS. Of 33 patients with presumed pancreatic cancer, laparoscopic findings changed the operative management of 11 patients, and LUS altered the management of an additional 6 patients. Laparotomy was avoided in 9 patients (27%). Among 14 patients with hepatobiliary tumors, laparotomy was avoided in 9 patients in whom laparoscopy and/or LUS revealed either benign or advanced disease. Operative management was altered in 4 of 18 patients with gastric or esophageal cancer by laparoscopic findings. LUS did not add to the management of these patients. Of 12 patients with presumed intra-abdominal lymphoma, 9 were diagnosed with lymphoma and 3 with benign disease, without laparotomy in all but 1 case. Laparoscopy and LUS are valuable tools for evaluating the resectability of pancreatic and hepatobiliary tumors. Laparoscopy, and to a lesser degree LUS, greatly facilitates diagnosing patients with intra-abdominal lymphomas and spares an occasional patient with esophagogastric carcinoma from undergoing laparotomy."

Eradication of the infection with antibiotic therapy may result in regression of the lymphoma. But when antibiotic treatment fails to reverse the malignant process or if H. pylori is absent, other treatment options should be considered. Because MLS is often confined to the stomach and regional lymph nodes, it is potentially curable with local therapy.

CD009944,0,10717512,0,Endosonography in gastric lymphoma and large gastric folds.,"To establish a correct preoperative differential diagnosis between gastric lymphoma and cancer is essential but can be difficult as endoscopic biopsies can sometimes provide a low diagnostic yield. By EUS, infiltrative carcinoma tends to show a vertical growth in the gastric wall, while lymphoma tends to show mainly a horizontal extension. EUS provides an accurate staging of gastric lymphoma, showing the exact level of infiltration and the presence of perigastric lymph nodes, thus the physician can obtain an accurate prognosis for each patient and select the best form of treatment accordingly. The response to chemoradiotherapy can also be investigated very accurately by EUS. Large gastric folds are seen in a great number of benign and malignant conditions. Diagnosis represents a clinical challenge because etiology may be extremely varied and standard biopsies are often inconclusive. Different diseases show different levels of infiltration of the gastric wall, thus a characteristic echo-pattern helps for the differential diagnosis. Endosonography, used always in combination with biopsy, allows to rule out malignancies and to select the most appropriate treatment for each patient (medical or surgical)."

However, the large diameter results in an inability to negotiate the primary tumor in 25% of patients. The aim of this study was first to determine whether use of the 8-mm esophagoprobe would overcome this problem and second to evaluate the accuracy of the smaller diameter instrument. One hundred consecutive patients with esophageal cancer underwent initial gastroscopy. Based upon the degree of luminal stenosis, patients were staged with either the conventional echoendoscope (luminal diameter > or = 15 mm) or the esophagoprobe (luminal diameter < 15 mm). The primary tumor was successfully negotiated in all subjects (echoendoscope 30, esophagoprobe 70) so that T- and N-staging was accomplished in every patient. Esophageal dilatation was performed in 12 patients (12%). The procedure was well tolerated and there were no complications, in particular no patient suffered esophageal perforation. The accuracy of the esophagoprobe for T-staging was 90% (19 out of 20) and that for N-staging was 75% (15 out of 20). This was similar to the accuracy of staging with the conventional echoendoscope, 90% (9 out of 10) for T-stage and 90% (9 out of 10) for N-stage. The esophagoprobe can safely and accurately stage patients with esophageal carcinoma, including those with high-grade stenoses."

CD009944,0,10586017,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography in patients with gastro-esophageal cancer.,For patients with gastro-esophageal cancer ultrasonography (EUS) is superior to any other imaging modality in the assessment of local tumor infiltration and local lymph nodes status. EUS is especially important in the preoperative staging of patients with esophageal cancer and patients with proximal gastric cancer. Here it allows for the identification of those patients with advanced disease who are unlikely to benefit from surgery and in whom a conservative palliative treatment is indicated. In advanced gastric cancer the clinical implications of EUS less clear. Still preoperative EUS is indicated in every patient with cancer of the proximal stomach to assess tumor infiltration in the esophagus. Relatively new is the use of EUS in staging early cancers in order to select patients for local endoscopic treatment. High-frequency miniprobes are the instruments of choice for imaging these lesions. Strict criteria should be applied in the selection of patients for local endoscopic treatment of early gastro-esophageal cancers. EUS guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is currently only indicated in patients with esophageal cancer and suspicious celiac lymph nodes. It may become more important if new treatment protocols demand more objective and reliable assessment of lymph node status.

CD009944,0,10555667,0,Unusual gastric tumors: radiologic-pathologic correlation.,"The overlap of radiologic findings in many gastric tumors makes differentiation difficult. However, some unusual gastric tumors have characteristic radiologic features that may suggest a specific diagnosis. At barium study, lipomas typically manifest as a smooth submucosal mass or an ulcerated lesion with a ""bull's-eye"" appearance that is indistinguishable from other mesenchymal tumors. At computed tomography (CT), lipomas usually manifest as well-circumscribed submucosal masses with fat attenuation. At radiology, glomus tumors appear as smooth submucosal masses with or without ulceration and may contain tiny flecks of calcification. These tumors frequently demonstrate strong enhancement on early-phase contrast material-enhanced images. At barium study, lymphangiomas may appear as smooth intramural masses that are indistinguishable from other mesenchymal tumors. At CT, they manifest as non-enhancing extramucosal masses with homogeneous low attenuation. Diffuse lesions in Brunner gland hamartoma manifest as multiple small nodules, producing a characteristic ""cobblestone"" appearance. Lymphomas may have typical imaging features (eg, more pronounced and homogeneous mural thickening) that can help differentiate them from adenocarcinoma. In addition, adenocarcinomas may demonstrate unusual findings such as transpyloric spread, unusually large polyps, or intratumoral calcifications. Familiarity with these radiologic features of gastric tumors can help ensure correct diagnosis and proper management."

Staging is essential to select patients who will benefit from operation because palliation can also be performed nonoperatively. Several studies, including limited numbers of patients, have shown that laparoscopic staging prevents unnecessary laparotomies, but it is doubtful whether general application of this staging method can be advised. The aim of this study was to assess the benefit of diagnostic laparoscopy for staging patients with esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and hepatopancreatobiliary tumors."
CD009944,0,10549014,0,[Laparoscopy in the staging of cancer of the stomach].,"Prognosis of gastric carcinoma is closely related to extension. Laparoscopic staging of digestive cancers is proposed to evaluate the regional cancer spreading (TNM). The aim of this procedure is to avoid unnecessary laparotomy, and to reduce mortality and morbidity of these procedures. Laparoscopic staging can also make easier the selection of patients of preoperative treatment. In most of the series about laparoscopic staging, efficacy of the usual staging tools (computed tomography, ultrasonography, endoscopic ultrasonography) is weak and before operation 20 to 30% of the metastases, particularly peritoneal and hepatic, are missed. Laparoscopic staging is technically easy: no more than 3 trocars are necessary, laparoscopic ultrasonography may be performed during the same procedure, as well as peritoneal cytology. Feasibility is about 100%. Usual contraindications of the laparoscopy are contraindications of laparoscopic staging. The main difficulty is its utility. Staging of advanced lesions remains the best indication of laparoscopic staging in gastric cancer. Metastatic spread, particularly to the peritoneum, and resectability may be evaluated with sensitivity and specificity close to 90%. Morbidity (1 to 3%) is usually low and mainly represented by wound complications."
CD009944,0,10505006,0,Pre-operative staging of ampullary tumours by endoscopic ultrasound.,"Ampullary carcinomas have a significantly higher resectability rate and better prognosis than other periampullary carcinomas, although the prognosis is poor with advanced disease. Accurate tumour staging is therefore important in surgical planning. Our objective was to evaluate the usefulness of, and problems associated with, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the pre-operative staging of ampullary tumours. 35 patients with ampullary tumours were pre-operatively examined with EUS. The imaging results were compared with histopathological findings of the resected specimen according to the TNM staging classification. The overall accuracy of tumour (T) staging was 74% (26/35) for all tumours, and 67% (6/9), 71% (10/14) and 83% (10/12) respectively for T1, T2 and T3 tumours. The overall accuracy of nodal (N) staging was 63%. In diagnosing pancreatic invasion, EUS had an accuracy of 86% (30/35), a sensitivity of 83% (10/12), and a specificity of 87% (20/23). In conclusion, EUS provides an accurate method of evaluating the stage of ampullary tumours, especially infiltration into the pancreas.

If CT is not conclusive or no local infiltration or distant metastasis is proven, endosonography should be performed. Gastric carcinoma: At present endosonography shows the highest accuracy for diagnosis of the T stage. For differentiation between T3 and T4 tumors the accuracy of CT is not sufficient to predict resectability. The N stage can be determined at present by no modality with sufficient accuracy. Distant metastasis can be diagnosed by CT with high sensitivity and specificity.

The advantages and indications for each method are described and an overview of the medical literature is given. The results in the literature are compared to our own findings, which were obtained in prospective studies comparing the four different imaging methods. On the basis of our experience and the literature, we conclude that the indication for the different diagnostic imaging methods primarily depends on the type of therapy concept followed in the respective surgical department. Endoscopy with biopsy remains the primary diagnostic procedure. Endosonography (EUS) is another diagnostic procedure, which can be performed simultaneously with endoscopy. Only special questions or reasons warrant the use of other imaging methods."

CD009944,0,10408157,1,The utility and limitations of an ultrasonic miniprobe in the staging of gastric cancer.,"To determine the utility and limitations of an ultrasonic miniprobe (UMP) in the staging of gastric cancer, we evaluated 46 patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) using an UMP and who were histologically determined to have gastric cancers. In every case, UMP findings were compared with histopathological findings after treatment. The total accuracy of UMP relative to the depth of tumor invasion was 71.7% (33/46 cases). Accuracy with respect to T1-m tumor diagnosis was 75.7% (22/29 cases), and for T1-sm, 76.9% (10/13 cases), but accuracy for T2 tumor diagnosis was low, due to ultrasound attenuation. When the analysis was carried out based on the size of tumor, the accuracy for UMP was 50.0% (9/18 cases) for all tumors over 20 mm and 85.7% (24/28 cases) for all tumors smaller than 20 mm. We conclude that UMP is suitable for investigation of tumor extension when the lesion is superficial and/or small gastric cancers which do not cause ultrasonic attenuation, but not when the tumor is large or located in certain sites, although conventional EUS is useful in some of these cases."

Once computed tomography scan has ruled out distant metastases or evident local invasion, endoscopic ultrasonography plays a key role in an adjunctive evaluation and planning of treatment. The diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography in oesophageal cancer is excellent. Its main limitations are: poor differentiation between early mucosal and submucosal cancer, insufficient accuracy in detecting early lymph node invasion, and lack of complete tumour evaluation in cases of high-grade strictures. The role of endoscopic ultrasonography in post-treatment assessment is still limited by some artifacts. However, all these limitations will soon be overcome by some technical improvements."

Epidemiological, histomorphological, molecular-biological and experimental data clearly underline that Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric mucosa without doubt plays an important role both in the development and progression of MALT lymphoma. Considering histological malignancy (low grade and high grade lymphoma) and dissemination of the disease (stage) as decisive prognostic factors and therapeutical determinants, endoscopic bioptic diagnosis as well as endoscopic ultrasound are of major importance in establishing diagnosis and clinical stage. In the case of localized low grade lymphoma, eradication of Helicobacter pylori offers a promising therapeutic option.

CD009944,0,10068723,0,[Endoscopic resection of the digestive tract mucosa].,"The endoscopic resection of the mucosa of the digestive tract (ERM) is a set of techniques that have as their end the remotion of the mucosa for the diagnosis and treatment of localized diseases. The technique consists of the elevation of the mucosa with a submucosa injection of liquid or with suction in the interior of a transparent overtube. The procedure is indicated in the treatment of incipient malignant tumors of the esophagus, stomach, and colon, with a success rate that vacillates between 60 and 95%. An indispensable condition is the precise selection of patients through endoscopy and high-frequency endoscopic ultrasound. Other indications are the resection of flat and sessile polyps, the biopsies of submucosa tumors, and the taking of biopsies of great volume for the study of infiltrating and inflammatory neoplastic diseases. Based on the literature, principally descriptive and not comparative, the treatment of incipient digestive tract carcinomas with ERM has encountered serious difficulties in the Western world because of the rarity of the diagnosis, the scarce availability of endoscopic ultrasound, and lack of information of long-term results. On the other hand, in the diagnostic field of mucosa diseases, and in the treatment of polyps, its utility is evident. In conclusion, ERM is added to the new endoscopic techniques for the obtaining of specimens of great volume and for the resection of sessile polyps. In the treatment of malignant tumors, ERM should be used with caution."

Thus, chemotherapy with cisplatinum, 5-FU and leucovorin seems to be suitable for a randomized multicenter trial sponsored by the EORTC. For entrance into the study the following requirements should be met: prospective diagnostic procedures including endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and surgical laparoscopy; standardised surgery (gastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy): prospective histopathological work up of the resected specimen including ypTNM category, ypUICC stages and R classification; prospectively scheduled follow-up intervals. Aim of the study, including 198 patients per treatment arm with a recruitment of 3 years and a minimum follow-up of 2 years, is the verification of the positive prognostic impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery compared with surgery alone in locally advanced gastric cancer (cuT 3cN1-3cM0)."

CD009944,0,9856667,0,Low sensitivity of computed tomography in the staging of gastric lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue: impact on prospective trials and ordinary clinical practice.,"The natural history and management of gastric lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALTomas) are not completely understood. Most stage I cases are now entered into prospective trials to confirm the excellent results obtained with conservative treatment, whereas current therapeutic policies are based on accumulated experience. The limits of staging work-ups may have a significant impact on prospective trials and ordinary clinical practice. The authors explore the sensitivity of computed tomography scanning in detecting perigastric adenopathy in 20 patients with gastric MALToma treated by gastrectomy. Clinical staging identified 17 patients as having stage I MALTomas and three patients as having stage II1 MALTomas. Histopathologic staging showed that 8 of 17 patients formerly diagnosed with stage I MALToma had perigastric nodal involvement, whereas the three patients with clinical stage II1 were confirmed as such. Computed tomography scanning has low sensitivity in detecting perigastric lymphadenopathy in gastric MALTomas. This leads to understaging, with a significant impact on therapeutic decision, and distorts newly acquired knowledge about the disease's natural history and management, introducing a bias in prospective clinical trials. Endoscopic ultrasonography should be tested as a staging procedure both in prospective trials and in ordinary clinical practice."
CD009944,0,9853223,0,Laparoscopic ultrasonography for abdominal tumor staging.,"In recent years, laparoscopic ultrasonography has been introduced as an adjunct to diagnostic laparoscopy for staging of tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract, liver, biliary tree, and pancreas. It has proved feasible to visualize most anatomic structures in the upper abdomen consistently and in detail with laparoscopic ultrasonography. Recent publications indicate that laparoscopic ultrasonography may be useful for detecting small liver metastases, lymph node metastases, small primary tumors of the pancreas and bile ducts, and for the assessment of the local extension of tumors of the pancreas and stomach. The ongoing improvements in US technology and the results of larger studies will in the near future determine the precise place of this new imaging modality for staging of abdominal tumors."
CD009944,0,9842543,0,[Surgical treatment of carcinoma of the cardia with special references to mediastinal extension and lymph node metastasis].,"We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological findings in 141 patients with advanced cardiac cancer. According to histological type, 117 patients had an adenocarcinoma and 24 patients a squamous cell carcinoma. Curative resection was performed in 114 patients, whereas the remaining 27 patients underwent palliative resection. Preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography and abdominal ultrasound were useful for the diagnosis of esophageal invasion and lymph node metastases. Particularly, the classification of paraaortic lymph node metastasis by ultrasound was important in deciding on the surgical method. Mediastinal lymph node metastases were found histologically in 19 of 68 patients. The survival of patients with mediastinal lymph node metastasis was poor. However, among them, a favorable outcome was expected for patients with few involved nodes and if only perigastric node involvement in abdominal nodes was found. Paraaortic lymph node metastasis was found histologically in 15 of 48 patients (27.9%). Two of 35-year survivors had 5 or fewer lymph node metastases, and showed only perigastric and paraaortic node involvement. It is equally important that tumor extension and lymph node metastases in the mediastinum and abdomen should be determined in the surgical treatment of advanced carcinoma of the cardia."

In this paper, diagnosis of these factors using endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and its accuracy are discussed. In 121 cases of gastric cancer in the cardiac area, EUS was performed and the findings compared with the pathological diagnosis. The depth of cancer invasion was accurately determined in 60% of mucosal cancer cases, 83% of cancer invading the submucosa, 50% of cancer invading the muscularis propria or the subserosa, 86% of cancer invading the serosa, 45% of cancer invading other organs, and overall accuracy was 77%. In cases of esophageal invasion sensitivity was 98%, specificity 93%, and overall accuracy 94%. In cases of lymph node metastasis specificity was 78%: 86% for N1 and 72% for N2. EUS therefore has an important role in diagnosis and selection of treatment."

CD009944,0,9840517,0,Staging of oesophageal carcinoma with high resolution endoluminal ultrasonography.,"Oesophageal carcinoma is a disease with poor prognosis despite improved treatment and diagnostic methods. The most important prognostic features are the degree of wall invasion and the presence of lymph node metastasis. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the region of 7.5-12 MHz has improved the accuracy of tumour staging. In the course of 1 year, 21 patients with oesophageal carcinoma were examined with 20 MHz high-resolution intraluminal ultrasonography (HRES). In 11 (52%) patients, both ultrasound catheter and fiber gastroscope could pass the tumour, in 5 (23%) only the ultrasound catheter could pass. In the remaining patients the ultrasound catheter could only partially pass without prior dilatation. One patient was classified as having a stage T2 tumour, 14 (67%) had T3 and 4 (19%) had T4. In 2 patients the tumour could not be fully classified but was at least T3 When comparing our results with findings at computed tomography (CT), the T stage coincided in 9 patients (42%), in 9 patients (42%) CT could not differentiate between T2 and T3 and in 3 investigations HRES showed a higher T stage than CT. In 3 patients (14%) ultrasonography found N1 stage where CT staged N0. In one patient, CT found lymph nodes not seen with HRES. Further studies comparing EUS, HRES and surgical findings are planned to assess our view that HRES is a useful method in preoperative staging of oesophageal carcinoma."
CD009944,0,9840099,0,Early gastric cancer with psammomatous calcification.,"We describe a 51 year-old man with calcified early gastric cancer. The calcification was not displayed by abdominal X-ray, CT, or conventional ultrasound. Only endoscopic ultrasonography displayed the distribution of calcification in vivo. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a slightly hypoechoic lesion with a high echoic line, without involvement of the fourth layer. Histopathologically, it was a IIc type early gastric cancer. The depth of cancer invasion was limited to the mucosa and a mucin pool was not observed. Psammomatous calcification was observed in the lumen of the carcinomatous glands. This seems to be the first case reported in which psammoma bodies were observed in early gastric cancer."
CD009944,0,9779628,0,Role of laparoscopic ultrasound in cancer management.,"Laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) has become an important tool in the staging of hepatic, pancreatic, and gastrointestinal malignancies. It also plays an important role in the palliation and treatment of these malignancies. The use of laparoscopy and LUS in diagnosis, staging, palliation, and treatment of intra-abdominal malignancies is discussed, with a focus on the literature and our own experience."
CD009944,0,9779627,0,Laparoscopic evaluation in pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer continues to carry a poor overall prognosis. The majority of patients have advanced disease at the time of presentation. Dynamic, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) has become the radiographic study of choice in the pre-operative staging of patients with pancreatic cancer. While it has been shown to be highly sensitive in determining unresectability of peri-ampullary tumors, the ability of CT to predict accurately which tumors can be safely resected is still limited. Laparoscopic staging of peri-ampullary tumors is superior to dynamic CT in visualizing small liver and peritoneal metastases. The addition of laparoscopic ultrasound during laparoscopic staging enhances the ability of laparoscopy to determine resectability of these tumors and approaches the accuracy of open exploration without increasing significant morbidity or mortality. Patients who are deemed unresectable at the time of laparoscopy can undergo palliative biliary and/or gastric bypass procedures laparoscopically and further minimize the morbidity of laparotomy."
CD009944,0,9772061,0,Multimodality treatment for gastric carcinoid tumor with liver metastases.,"Carcinoid tumors are the most common neuroendocrine tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, and between 10% and 30% of these tumors are gastric in origin. Three types of gastric carcinoid tumors are recognized: type I, associated with chronic atrophic gastritis type A; type II, associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia; and type III, sporadic and the most malignant. We present a patient with an aggressive, sporadic-type gastric carcinoid that metastasized to the liver. Her symptomatic treatment included the somatostatin analog octreotide. Octreotide scintigraphy demonstrated that this tumor avidly bound the peptide. The patient's gastric carcinoid (assessed by endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound) regressed and she underwent hepatic artery embolization for her liver metastases. After initial partial CT resolution the tumor grew, compressing the inferior vena cava. The patient underwent orthotopic liver transplant with excellent recovery, although she was subsequently found to have two small lung metastases. She has responded well to adjuvant Indium-111 octreotide receptor targeted therapy. This case highlights the therapeutic options for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, including liver transplantation and adjuvant receptor targeted therapy."
CD009944,0,9765090,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography in large gastric folds.,"Large gastric folds are seen in a great number of benign and malignant conditions. Diagnosis is a clinical challenge because the etiology may be extremely varied and standard biopsies are often inconclusive. The gastric wall is considered thickened at endosonography when it is more than 3.6 mm in width. Different diseases show different levels of infiltration of the gastric wall. When abnormalities involve the second layer only, benign conditions can be considered and standard endoscopic biopsies are often diagnostic. When abnormalities involve layers two and three, different diseases can be suspected, including Helicobacter pylori infection and lymphoma; in this case large-particle biopsy should be considered. When abnormalities involve layer four, malignancy should be strongly suspected even if standard or large-particle biopsies are negative. Endosonography, always in combination with fine-needle or guillotine-needle biopsy, should be able to rule out malignancies and to select the most appropriate treatment for each patient."

CD009944,0,9765088,1,Staging of gastric cancer with endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic mucosal resection.,"Since it was found that the gastrointestinal wall is visualized as a five-layered structure corresponding to the histological layers of the wall, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has become recognized clinically as the most accurate method for diagnosing and assessing the local staging of gastric cancer. However, some problems have remained, including how to differentiate between cancer invasion and ulcer fibrosis, how to detect microinvasion, and how to recognize malignant lymph nodes. Using the pattern analysis for depressed-type gastric cancer, it is usually possible to distinguish between cancer invasion and ulcer fibrosis, except in cases of microinvasion into ulcer fibrosis or inadequate scanning. However, the sensitivity of EUS for evaluating metastatic lymph nodes is still problematic. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for early gastric cancer has been widely accepted as a standard treatment in Japan due to its minimal invasiveness. According to our data, the overall rate of radical resection was 68.3% (168 of 246), and 31.7% of the remaining patients additionally received laser treatment, surgery, or heater-probe treatment. There were no deaths owing to gastric cancer. Some lesions in which there was microinvasion of the submucosa were incorrectly diagnosed by EUS. It may be possible to solve this problem using three-dimensional EUS (3D-EUS) in the near future."

One hundred and nineteen patients with gastric cancer who received preoperative assessment by EUS underwent subsequent surgery. The endosonographic tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification was used for comparison with the histopathologic findings of the resected specimens. The ability of EUS to accurately predict the T stage (depth of tumor invasion) and N stage (involvement of lymph node) was 70% and 65%, respectively. EUS displayed a tendency to overestimate T stage and underestimate N state. The differentiation of early gastric cancer from advanced gastric cancer showed a concordance rate of 89% and underestimation rate of 8% and underestimation rate of 3%. The accuracy of EUS in predicting the stage T1 to T3, which correspond to D0 resectability (no macroscopic or microscopic tumor remains), was 91%. In conclusion, these results revealed EUS as a valuable tool for evaluating the local staging and resectability of gastric cancer. We suggest that EUS should be introduced in the preoperative assessment of patients with gastric cancer."
CD009944,0,9716038,0,Positron emission tomography for staging of oesophageal and gastroesophageal malignancy.,"Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) was prospectively investigated as a means of detecting metastatic disease in patients with oesophageal tumours and compared with computerized tomography (CT), with the surgical findings as a gold standard. Twenty-six patients with a malignant tumour of the oesophagus or gastroesophageal junction underwent CT and PET of the chest and the abdomen. Seven patients underwent laparoscopy to establish resectability. Fifteen patients underwent laparotomy without prior laparoscopy. Four patients did not undergo surgery. The primary tumour was visualized in 81% of patients with CT and in 96% with PET. Neither CT nor PET were suited to assess the extent of wall invasion. Surgically assessed nodal status corresponded in 62% with CT and in 90% with PET. Distant metastases were found in five patients with CT and in eight with PET. The diagnostic accuracy of CT in determining resectability was 65% and for PET 88%. For CT and PET together this was 92%. The present study indicates that FDG-PET can be of importance for staging patients with oesophageal tumours. PET has a higher sensitivity for nodal and distant metastases and a higher accuracy for determining respectability than CT. PET and CT together would have decreased ill-advised surgery by 90%."

We performed a comparative study of endosonographic findings of EBV-positive and -negative early gastric carcinomas. Epstein-Barr virus was detected in 11.8% (four of 34) of endosonographically observed early gastric carcinoma lesions. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a hypoechoic mass in the third layer, which reflected submucosal nodules, in 75% (three of four) of EBV-associated lesions. Endoscopically, in 66.7% (two of three) of EBV-associated carcinomas, the depressed lesion was surrounded by a raised margin covered with normal mucosa and was similar to a submucosal tumour (P < 0.05). Histologically, all three cases of EBV-associated lesions with submucosal tumour invasion had submucosal nodules of carcinoma with lymphoid stroma and 75% (three of four) were located in the gastric body. The ratio of maximal thickness to width of EBV-associated lesions was significantly larger than that of EBV-negative lesions, and this tendency was marked in lesions with submucosal tumour invasion (P < 0.05). This study indicated that EUS and endoscopy are of great use for the determination of EBV association with early gastric carcinoma."

CD009944,0,9681605,0,Rational lymphadenectomy for early gastric cancer with submucosal invasion: a clinicopathological study.,"Among all the patients who underwent gastrectomy for primary solitary gastric cancer at our department from 1979 to 1994, 228 patients had gastric cancer that invaded the submucosal layer. These cases were thus examined clinicopathologically, including the extent of submucosal invasion. No lymph node metastasis was found in any of the cancers measuring less than 2 cm in diameter. Macroscopic type I lesions or various combined types (IIa + IIc, IIc + IIa, IIc + III) were more likely to infiltrate deeply and were also associated with a high incidence (18%-25%) of lymph node metastasis. No lymph node metastasis or vascular invasion was found in any simple type IIa lesions. The incidence of lymph node metastasis was 3% in simple type IIc cancers measuring 3 cm or less. In addition, submucosal microinvasion (sm1) simple type IIc cancers showed no accompanying lymph node metastasis or vascular invasion. We thus conclude that a full-thickness partial resection of the stomach, such as a laparoscopic local resection, is applicable to cancers measuring 3 cm or less provided that they are either simple macroscopic type IIa or simple type IIc sm1 cancers."

Laparoscopic and thoracoscopic ultrasound are the latest modes of intraoperative sonography. They have been introduced mainly to overcome the two major drawbacks of laparoscopy, i.e. the capability of showing only the surface of the organs and the lack of manual palpation of the anatomical structures. We review and discuss the established and the most recent applications of intraoperative and laparoscopic ultrasound."

In view of histological malignancy (low or high grade) and dissemination of the disease (stage) as decisive prognostic factors and therapeutical determinants endoscopic-bioptical diagnosis as well as endoscopic ultrasound are of major importance. In case of localized low-grade lymphoma eradication of Helicobacter pylori offers a promising therapeutic option.

CD009944,0,9612630,0,[Hydrosonography as an alternative or supplement to endosonography in stomach carcinoma].,"Transabdominal ultrasound in the hydrotechnique (hydrosonography) was compared with endosonography for the locoregional staging of gastric cancer. For this purpose 52 consecutive patients were examined by endosonography (7.5 and 12 MHz) and hydrosonography (3.75 MHz). Forty-nine of the 52 tumors could be examined by endosonography and 41 by hydrosonography. The T-staging accuracy rate of endosonography was 74% and 46% for hydrosonography. Carcinoma of the cardia are often classified as uT3 and hT3 preoperatively and pT2 postoperatively due to infiltration of the subserosal fat. The N-staging accuracy rate of endosonography was 86% and 61% for hydrosonography. Based on these results, transabdominal ultrasound in the hydrotechnique (hydrosonography) cannot replace endosonography in gastric cancer staging. However, when performed in conjunction with conventional ultrasound, hydrosonography provides useful information about the local tumor stage, especially in cases of advanced and stenotic tumors."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of EUS in the staging of esophageal carcinoma as well as its applicability and usefulness in tumors with nontraversable stenoses. EUS was performed in 43 patients with esophageal carcinoma. The technique was carried out with a radial echoendoscope under sedation with i.v. midazolam. Both, the infiltration of the tumor through the layers of the esophageal wall (T staging) and the presence of lymph nodes in different areas (N and M staging) were determined. In cases with nontraversable stenoses, only the proximal tumor margin was assessed by means of EUS. EUS showed T1 stage in only one case and more advanced stages in the remaining patients: T2 (n = 12), T3 (n = 22) and T4 (n = 4). We know the outcome of 28 patients, 14 of whom underwent surgery. In these patients, the sensitivity for T and N staging was 86% and 92% respectively, and the accuracy 86% in both. Both, T and N, were overstaged in one case (7%) and understaged in another (7%). The tumor caused nontraversable stenoses in 59% of patients (n = 26). In 4 patients the staging could not be assessed with sufficient reliability. In the subgroup of patients with nontraversable stenoses who underwent surgery, the accuracy of EUS when comparing with histopathology was 80%. Endoscopic ultrasonography has a high sensitivity and accuracy in the staging of esophageal tumors even in cases with nontraversable stenoses."

CD009944,0,9584570,0,[Stage-adapted radical principles in gastric carcinoma].,"The aim of any surgical approach to gastric carcinoma should be a complete resection with no residual tumor left behind, that is, a R0-resection according to UICC. Complete tumor resection in this respect refers to the primary tumor as well as to the lymphatic drainage and requires an adequate safety margin. The indications for surgical therapy of gastric cancer and the choice of procedure should consequently be guided by the tumor stage. This requires accurate preoperative staging, which can today be achieved with endoscopic ultrasonography and surgical laparoscopy. Gastric carcinoma stage IA (mucosa carcinoma) can be cured by local excision. In patients with tumor Stages IB (submucosa carcinoma), II, and IIIA, lymph node metastases are common. Based on the available data, this group of patients benefits from radical resection and D2 lymph node dissection. The overall 5-year survival rate of 50% for the large number of patients undergoing gastric resection for cancer seems to demonstrate convincingly the value of extended lymphadenectomy. In patients with advanced gastric carcinoma, that is, tumor stages IIIB and IV, a complete tumor removal usually can not be achieved by surgical dissection. Neoadjuvant therapeutic modalities should consequently be assessed in these patients. Based on tumor location and growth pattern, a total gastrectomy is the procedure of choice in patients with middle and proximal third gastric cancer. A subtotal gastrectomy may be performed in patients with tumors of the distal third and ""Laurens intestinal type"" growth pattern. The distal site of the main lesion must be investigated carefully to ensure that incidental concomitant lesions are not overlooked. Depending on the individual tumor situation, the gastrectomy can be extended toward varying portions of the distal esophagus or the pancreas, preserving splenectomy and resection of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The high incidence of locoregional recurrences and distant metastases after curative surgery for gastric cancer calls for improved locoregional control and systemic adjuvant treatment."

Therefore, pretherapeutic tumor staging according to the TNM classification is essential for the optimal application of various therapeutic modalities. According to recent studies, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the most sensitive technique in measuring tumor infiltration (T-staging). In addition, although less reliable compared to the T-staging, the sensitivity of EUS in assessing lymph node status (N-staging) is superior to computed tomography and conventional ultrasound.

CD009944,0,9563443,0,Gastric cancer in Asia: progress and controversies in surgical management.,"Considerable controversy surrounds the management of gastric cancer and this has largely overshadowed recent progress in our understanding of the epidemiology and molecular pathogenesis of the disease, and improvements in diagnostic and staging techniques. Differences identifiable in the molecular pathogenesis of the 'intestinal' and 'diffuse' types of gastric cancer may help to unravel the biological behaviour of variants and ultimately influence therapeutic strategies. Endoscopic ultrasound is well established as being accurate for T staging and the introduction of laparoscopy, with or without ultrasound, is obviating unnecessary laparotomy in non-bleeding, non-obstructed patients. Controversies in surgery encompass the role of laparoscopic surgery in early gastric cancer, the extent of lymphadenectomy including para-aortic nodal dissection, resection of en bloc contiguous organ involvement, pancreatosplenectomy, left upper abdominal evisceration, and modes of reconstruction (pylorus-preserving gastrectomy, pouch formation) to enhance quality of life. Whereas adjuvant chemotherapy does not impact favourably on survival, emphasis has now shifted to neoadjuvant (induction) chemotherapy to downstage the disease. Preoperative regional chemotherapy and intra-operative hyperthermic chemotherapy or irradiation may prove to be of benefit in patients with resectable disease, but some scepticism still exists as to the usefulness of biological response modifiers (e.g. OK432, PSK) for adjuvant treatment. Ethical issues relating to cultural differences in Asia sometimes mitigate against adequate trial design (e.g. a surgery-alone control group or a no adjuvant therapy treatment group may be considered inappropriate) and this has understandably hindered acceptance in Western countries of the value of current management practices in Asia. These issues and the need for ongoing well-conducted randomized trials with prospective subset analysis are now being addressed."
CD009944,0,9544498,0,[Value of endosonography in diagnosis of diffusely growing stomach carcinomas].,"The diagnosis of diffuse type gastric carcinoma is very difficult. The delay of diagnosis is often due to false-negative endoscopic and histologic evaluation. The architecture of the stomach can be clearly visualized by endosonography. Therefore, already minor destructions of the gastric layers can be found. The endosonographic picture includes the presence of the layers, which are larger and of irregular contour. In infiltrating gastric cancer typically the submucosal layer and the muscularis are concentrically enlarged and appear folded. Based on the endosonographic picture diffuse type gastric carcinoma has been diagnosed in 32 patients. When compared to the histologic diagnosis after gastrectomy or autopsy the accuracy of the endosonographic diagnosis was 87.5%, (28 out of 32 patients). From the remaining four patients diagnosed to have diffuse type gastric cancer by endosonography three patients turned out to have malignant infiltrating tumors of different histologies. Therefore, the positive predictive value of endosonography in detection of infiltrating malignant tumors was 96.8% in our group. In contrast the accuracy of preoperative histologic diagnosis by biopsies was only 58%. Suspicious results of gastroscopy, especially in combination with a negative biopsy, should lead to further evaluation by endosonography to detect diffuse type gastric cancer earlier."

Subtotal gastrectomy along with removal of the perigastric (D1) and selective extraperigastric lymph nodes over the celiac trunk was accomplished laparoscopically, through five punctures and a minilaparotomy.

Generally radial scanning provided better spatial orientation and was easier to assess. An advantage of the longitudinal curved array scanner is the feasibility of EUS-guided biopsy."
CD009944,0,9451678,0,Diffuse cystic malformation and neoplasia-associated cystic formation in the stomach. Endosonographic features and diagnosis of tumor depth.,"We have evaluated the endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) features of cystic malformation of the stomach and the depth of associated neoplasia. We included 15 patients with multiple cystic components identified on EUS: 6 patients with multiple cysts restricted focally to gastric neoplasia and 9 patients with diffusely distributed cysts. We categorized the former findings as focal cystic malformation (FCM), and the latter as diffuse cystic malformation (DCM) of the stomach and reviewed the endosonographic features. Both FCM and DCM tended to show male preponderance and develop in older patients. Cystic changes in FCM extended from the neoplastic lesion to the submucosa regardless of the location in the stomach. Diffuse cystic malformation was located predominantly in the gastric body and mainly was shown as the thickened submucosa and/or deep mucosa with multiple cystic components. The boundary between the mucosal layer or the tumor echo and the submucosal layer was indistinct in eight patients, which led to a lower accuracy in EUS diagnosis of tumor depth. Diffuse cystic malformation has characteristic EUS features and occasionally is accompanied by gastric neoplasia. Endoscopic ultrasonography is inaccurate in determining tumor depth when multiple submucosal cysts are present."
CD009944,0,9383346,0,The use of laparoscopic ultrasound in the assessment of pancreatic cancer.,"26 consecutive cases of obstructive jaundice due to a carcinoma of the head of the pancreas were studied prospectively with ultrasound (US), computerized tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS). Sensitivity of US, CT were comparable, although CT seems better to evaluate the size of the tumor and for lymph node detection. 50 percent of patients had a criterion for noncurative resection. EUS (16 cases) had the best sensitivity (100 percent) for the staging of small tumors (less than 20 mm), detection of adjacent nodes and the relation between tumors- and mesenteric and portal vein. EUS was not able to detect peritoneal and/or liver micro-metastases. The criterion for noncurative resection was 57.6%. LUS exactly assessed all tumors larger than 2 cm. The accuracy compared with EUS was not as good for small tumors, but better concerning micro-peritoneal or hepatic metastasis. The criterion for noncurative resection was 80.7 percent. These results suggest to use of US and CT as first-line procedures in the preoperative staging and assessment of resectability of pancreatic cancers. When the patient does not appear to have disseminated lesions, EUS gives a good estimation of the size of the tumor, node assessment and vascular relations. LUS could be the first step for a curative surgical treatment. LUS revelated to discover 15 to 30 percent of unknown micro-metastases and avoided useless laparotomy in these patients."

CD009944,0,9247433,0,Portal vein thrombosis in the adult: surgical implications in an era of dynamic imaging.,"Extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (EHPVT) is the leading cause of variceal hemorrhage in patients with healthy livers; however, in an era of dynamic imaging, the incidental discovery of EHPVT places a special burden on the surgeon to understand the surgical implications of the disease in this setting. During the period 1989 to 1995, 23 patients (12 males and 11 females) were found to have EHPVT. In 20 (87%), this was an unexpected finding on ultrasound (11 of 23), abdominal CT scan (9 of 23), or both (9 of 23). In two patients, the diagnosis was suspected and confirmed with angiography, whereas in the other, the lesion was discovered at surgery. Only seven (30%) had hemorrhage as a presenting complaint. More typically (61%), abdominal pain alone or pain with sepsis was the indication for evaluation. In 20 patients (87%), there was an identifiable etiology for the EHPVT. A total of 15 operations were performed on 12 patients (52%), in 7 (4, variceal hemorrhage, and 3, bowel ischemia) as a direct consequence of the EHPVT and in five, for conditions not directly related to the EHPVT. Three of the 23 patients (13%) died, two (17%) following surgery and one (9%) from advanced malignant disease. No patients with hemorrhage (seven), even those who required a shunt for decompression (three) or devascularization (one), died. We found that the diagnosis of EHPVT is usually not related to variceal hemorrhage, but rather, abdominal symptoms that serve as an indication for the imaging study. Three subsets of patients emerged: (1) those requiring no surgery (11 patients), (2) those requiring surgery related to hemorrhage (4 patients), and (3) those requiring surgery for conditions other than varices (8 patients). In any of these circumstances, mortality (13%) was related to the underlying disease process rather than EHPVT. Given the earlier recognition of EHPVT, the natural history of the disease has been altered, with outcome reflecting the underlying disease rather than the sequelae of portal hypertension."
CD009944,0,9245882,1,Pre-operative TN staging of gastric cancer using a 15 MHz ultrasound miniprobe.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of and problems associated with a new endoscopically guided ultrasound miniprobe, used for pre-operative staging of gastric cancers. 59 cases of gastric cancer were prospectively examined with a 15 MHz ultrasound miniprobe. The results of the ultrasound imaging were compared with the histological findings of the resected specimens. The accuracy of the miniprobe for depth of invasion (T category) was 61% for all tumours, and 72% and 40%, respectively, for T1 and T2 to T4 lesions. If indeterminate cases due to ultrasound attenuation were excluded, the accuracy was improved to 82% for T1 and 57% for T2 to T4 tumours, respectively. The accuracy of the miniprobe for nodal staging (N category) was 69% overall, and 86%, 25% and 14% for stages N0, N1 and N2, respectively. In tumours classified on the basis of endoscopic types, the miniprobe staged early type gastric cancers (T category = 73%, N category = 80%) significantly (p < 0.01) more accurately than advanced ones (T category = 21%, N category = 36%). This study suggests that the miniprobe is indicated for pre-operative TN staging when endoscopy reveals an early gastric cancer."
CD009944,0,9245881,1,Relationship between histological type and endosonographic detection of regional lymph node metastases in gastric cancer.,"The aim of the study was to compare the ability of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in detecting lymph node metastases in differentiated and undifferentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. EUS was performed in 149 patients with differentiated or undifferentiated gastric cancer. Histopathological findings were compared with pre-operative EUS findings in a total of 2961 resected lymph nodes. The EUS detection rates of metastasis to individual nodes in relation to node size, the ratio of the metastasized area to the cross-sectional area of the node and to the depth of primary tumour invasion, were also investigated. The accuracy and negative predictive values of EUS for detecting metastatic lymphadenopathy in each patient were significantly higher for differentiated (87%, 94%) than for undifferentiated (71%, 71%) tumours. The detection rate of individual node metastasis was higher for differentiated (31%) than for undifferentiated (21%) tumours. For differentiated lesions, EUS detected more small nodal metastases (< 5 mm in diameter) (p < 0.01) and more nodes involved with a relatively small proportion of the metastasized area to the cross-sectional area of the node (< 1/3 involvement) (p < 0.05). In relatively superficial lesions, such as pT1 and pT2, the pre-operative EUS detection rate of metastatic nodes was higher for differentiated than for undifferentiated tumours. In conclusion, the ability of EUS to detect nodal metastases is related to the histological type of gastric cancer."
CD009944,0,9206626,0,"[Surgical relevance of preoperative diagnosis of tumors of the gastrointestinal tract--decision making in esophageal, stomach, colon and rectal carcinoma].","The increasing spectrum of therapeutic options for tumors of the gastrointestinal tract has resulted in a refinement of the pretherapeutic diagnostic strategies. The diagnostic approach in surgical institutions that are focused on primary surgical resection will therefore be much less sophisticated than in institutions who propose a selective therapeutic approach based on the pretherapeutic tumor stage and prognostic parameters. Pretherapeutic assessment of the depth of tumor infiltration, i.e. the T-category, is essential because most further diagnostic and therapeutic decisions are based on this information. This can today be achieved with a high degree of accuracy by endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography. Early T-stages (T1-2) are usually an indication for primary surgical resection and, after exclusion of distant metastases, no further diagnostic studies are required. In patients with locally advanced esophageal, gastric or rectum tumors (T3-4) multimodal therapeutic concepts should be considered. This usually requires additional diagnostic studies. None of the available diagnostic imaging modalities today allows satisfactory pretherapeutic assessment of lymph node metastases. The assumed nodular status should therefore currently not influence therapeutic decisions. Essential is, however, the assessment of distant metastases, since the documentation of distant tumor spread will change the therapeutic approach to a palliative situation. Detailed histologic and molecular-biologic assessment of tumor characteristics is growing in importance. This not only provides therapeutically relevant information regarding tumor grading, but opens the door towards a modern molecular diagnostic approach. It can be expected that in the near future a vast amount of relevant prognostic information can be obtained from endoscopic tumor biopsies, which may soon alter our therapeutic concepts."

The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the most frequent extranodal site of the disease. The optimal therapy for HIV-related lymphoma remains a matter of controversy. In a retrospective analysis we found gastrointestinal lymphoma in ten of 306 HIV-infected patients (3.3%) with a median CD4-count of 92/microliter at time of diagnosis. Median survival for the chemotherapy treatment group was 15 months. The high incidence of gastrointestinal NHL prompted us to commence a prospective survey on diagnostic procedures, therapy and outcome of patients with HIV-infection and gastrointestinal symptoms. 93 of 341 HIV-infected patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were examined by endoscopy. In selected patients we used in addition endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for visualization and staging before and after chemotherapy. NHL of the GIT was detected in seven of 93 endoscopically examined patients (7.5%). All patients were treated with CHOP initially. Mean survival time was ten months, mean CD4-count at diagnosis 193/microliter (range 0-417). Our results indicate that the diagnosis of gastrointestinal lymphoma should be considered in any HIV-infected patient presenting with unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms. In this group of patients NHL was detected in 7.5% of cases. The use of EUS improves the staging procedure before therapy. Treatment with CHOP resulted in relatively high remission rates and was associated with a low rate of treatment-induced myelosuppression."

In 110 resected adenocarcinomas, the proportion of intestinal-type cells increased with progression, as assessed by depth of invasion. The coincidence rate for gastric and intestinal phenotypic expression in biopsied and resected specimens was 96.3%. The positive predictive value of assessment of depth of invasion by ES was 73%. A low positive predictive value (45%) was achieved with type II-3 cases (according to our classification). However, the predictive value improved to 68% when depth of invasion was evaluated as the submucosal layer or deeper in cases in which more than 10% of cancer cells were of intestinal-type, although statistical analysis showed no significant difference between these predictive values. The sensitivity of diagnosis of submucosal invasion by cell differentiation in the type II-3 cases was significantly higher than that for the other types (89.5% versus 59.1%; P = 0.037). Phenotypic expression in biopsied specimens of gastric carcinomas proved helpful for evaluating the depth of invasion of gastric carcinoma by ES."
CD009944,0,9074915,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography for esophageal and gastric mass lesions.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography is a relatively new and evolving imaging modality incorporating endoscopy and ultrasonography into one comprehensive examination of the gut wall. Its principal indication has been the locoregional staging (T and N) of gastrointestinal tumors, particularly of the esophagus and stomach. Accuracy of conventional radiographic modalities (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) has been disappointing (50-60%). Alternatively, the staging accuracy of the depth of tumor penetration (T stage) approaches 85-90% in most series, whereas that for lymph node assessment (N stage) has been in the 70-80% range. The precise stage of upper gastrointestinal neoplasms provides accurate pretreatment assessment of the patient's prognosis and may influence therapeutic decisions. Endosonography is also the diagnostic modality of choice in the evaluation of submucosal tumors. It can demonstrate size, layer of origin, and, by its echo texture, can accurately predict etiology of the neoplasm. The only limitation may be in the differentiation of benign from malignant smooth muscle tumors."

The remaining three cases were all maltomas. After examining the histological characteristics and classification of primary gastric lymphomas, the authors underline the importance of an early preoperative diagnosis of gastric lymphoma. The repeated use of endoscopic techniques with biopsy compared to radiological examination increases the possibility of diagnosing lymphoma from 20% to 85%. The success rate is further increased if ultrasonic endoscopy is used instead of endoscopy alone, thus making it possible to achieve a 97% diagnostic success rate. The authors then emphasise the fundamental role played by surgery in the treatment of gastric lymphoma. Depending on the depth of neoplastic infiltration, the dimensions of the neoplasia and its multifocality, in localised forms of the antrum (IE, IIE with a low degree of malignancy) surgery consists of resection with partial gastrectomy, provided the resection margins are undamaged, or total gastrectomy in those forms involving the fundus and body of the stomach."

An improvement in this situation is best accomplished by preoperative treatment modalities to increase the R0 resection rate and by preoperative and postoperative treatment to reduce local recurrences and distant metastases. For LAGC, which includes approximately two thirds of patients with locoregionally confined tumors, preoperative chemotherapy (CTx) represents a promising approach. Among a group of patients with surgically or clinically staged unresectable LAGC, approximately half underwent R0 resection after downstaging induced by active CTx. The long-term survival of these patients seems to be improved. Even in patients who had primarily unresectable tumors as defined by explorative laparotomy, the long-term survival was about 20% after preoperative CTx and subsequent surgery. Based on these experiences, randomized trials investigating preoperative CTx versus surgery alone are clearly needed to define whether such an approach has an impact on RO resection rates and survival of patients with LAGC.

The accuracy of tumour and nodal staging using both modalities was compared to the final histological staging of the resected specimens. In staging depth of tumour growth, EUS was significantly more accurate (87% of lesions correctly staged) than CT (40% correctly staged). In staging nodal involvement, EUS was again significantly more accurate (73% correctly staged) than CT (33%). Two-thirds of the lesions were traversable with the endoscopic probe, but most of the nontraversed lesions were correctly staged on EUS. In this study, CT has performed poorly as a staging modality for carcinoma at the gastro-oesophageal junction. Other studies have shown CT to be less accurate at this location than at other oesophageal sites. The orientation of the gastro-oesophageal junction, lack of surrounding fat planes, proximity of adjacent organs and patient motion contribute to the poor staging performance of CT at this location. In contrast, EUS has been an accurate staging modality at the gastro-oesophageal junction in this study and compares well with other studies evaluating EUS in the more proximal oesophagus.

Clinically important uses include the evaluation of submucosal tumors, thickened gastric folds, changes seen with portal hypertension, and the staging of gastric malignancy. Two basic principles should be considered when applying this modality in clinical practice. The first is that for any test to be considered truly indicated, the results should have some significant impact on management decisions and/or quality of life for the individual.

CD009944,0,8696704,0,Short communication: detection of early scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach by endoscopic ultrasonography.,The endoscopic ultrasonography (US) characteristics of early scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach (ESS) were evaluated in four patients. ESS was defined as the presence of poorly differentiated carcinoma cells spreading through the submucosa and muscularis propria in association with a marked desmoplastic reaction without serosal invasion. ESS was characterized by localized irregular hypoechoic enlargement of the third (submucosal) and the fourth (muscularis propria) layers. The fifth (serosal) layer was normal. The third and fourth layers showed a threefold increase in thickness compared with the thickness of these layers in healthy subjects. Our results suggest that endoscopic US is useful for diagnosis of ESS.
CD009944,0,8688702,1,"Computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasonography and intraoperative assessment in TN staging of gastric carcinoma.","In a prospective study from November 1989 to December 1993, the accuracy of computed tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and intraoperative surgical assessment were compared for the evaluation of the depth of invasion (T category) and involvement of lymph nodes (N category) in patients with gastric carcinoma. Sixty-nine consecutive patients who received preoperative CT and EUS underwent subsequent surgery. CT and EUS results were compared with histopathologic staging of tumor invasion depth and regional lymph node metastasis (pT and pN categories). T categories were staged correctly in 42% of the cases by CT, 71% by EUS and 55% by intraoperative surgical assessment. CT correctly staged 49% of N1 and N2 lymph nodes compared with 65% for EUS and 45% for intraoperative surgical assessment. CT was more accurate for advanced cancer but had a tendency to understage the T and N categories. EUS was more accurate for serosal cancer and displayed a tendency to overstage T categories and understage N categories. Intraoperative surgical assessment overstaged early T stages, understaged the T4 stage and had a tendency to overstage N categories. CT and intraoperative surgical assessment of T and N categories were of limited value in the staging of gastric carcinoma compared to EUS. EUS is a valuable form of assessment to evaluate gastric cancer staging before surgery."

CD009944,0,8658218,0,Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound in the staging of gastric cancer.,"As patients with gastric cancer are offered choices between surgical resection, investigational neoadjuvant chemotherapy, palliative chemotherapy, or symptomatic relief alone, the need for accurate preoperative staging becomes apparent. Laparoscopy has been suggested as an accurate staging modality in a variety of upper gastrointestinal malignancies. It allows for assessment of the stage of the primary tumor, identification of hepatic or regional nodal metastases, and the detection of small volume peritoneal disease unappreciated by other noninvasive staging modalities such as computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or endoscopic ultrasound. This article reviews the current literature concerning laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) in the staging of gastric cancer. The Memorial Hospital experience with 92 patients is described. In this group, metastatic disease unappreciated by conventional staging modalities was found in 31 cases. The preliminary experience with LUS suggests that its addition to standard laparoscopy increases the sensitivity and specificity of M1 screening as well as introducing T and N staging capabilities."
CD009944,0,8658217,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography.,"Optimal treatment of gastric carcinoma requires accurate staging as there are marked differences in the prognosis of early and advanced gastric cancer which influence the decision for surgical resection versus nonsurgical palliation. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), by virtue of its considerable accuracy, has become the method of choice for regional staging of gastric cancer. EUS is unique in its ability to image the gastric wall as a 5-layer structure that correlates with actual histological layers. Thus, tumor depth can be imaged very precisely. Peritumor inflammation is the most common cause for overstaging by EUS; difficulty in determining tumor involvement of, but not through, the subserosa is another important reason for inaccurate staging. EUS is able also to detect small lymph nodes in the perigastric region. Although assessment of malignancy in nodes can be difficult, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology appears to be an accurate method to determine lymph node status. Surgery remains the standard treatment for gastric cancer, but new methods of endoscopic resection combined with high-frequency ultrasound may hold promise for future treatment of early gastric cancer. In addition to current radial and sector scanning instruments, recently introduced high-frequency ultrasound probes enhance the diagnostic possibilities of this technology."

CD009944,0,8731844,0,[The role of endoscopic ultrasonography and epidermal growth factor receptor assay in preoperative staging for gastric carcinoma].,Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed in 36 patients with gastric carcinoma and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of the specimen from endoscopic biopsy in 19 patients with gastric carcinoma was measured with immunoassay. Results of EUS were compared to the pathology of resected specimens according to the new (1987) TNM classification. EUS was very accurate in assessing the depth of tumor infiltration and the lymph node metastasis. Overall accuracy in T and N stage were 81% and 72% respectively. The level of EGFR in patients with infiltration into the neighbouring organs (97.7 +/- 27.9 fmol/mg pro.) were significantly higher than those without infiltration (47.7 +/- 21.3 fmol/mg pro.) (P < 0.01). The EGFR levels of those with lymph node metastasis (85 +/- 24.3 fmol/mg pro.) were significantly higher than that without lymph node metastasis (37.1 +/- 16.1 fmol/mg pro.) (P < 0.01). The results show that EUS as well as the EGFR assay could be used to determine the progress and prognosis of gastric carcinoma.

CD009944,0,8554267,0,[Imaging of cancer of the esophagus: ultrasound-endoscopy or computed tomography?].,"The aim of this retrospective study, in 100 patients who had an esophagectomy from 1987 to 1992 for squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus, was to determine the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and computed tomography (CT) in the preoperative staging of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The EUS report were compared to the pathological findings for the T stage. Both EUS and CT reports were compared with surgical and pathological findings for N stage (N0/N1) and mediastinal extension. In the 100 patients, EUS accuracy for T stage was 80%; EUS was more accurate for N stage than CT (71% vs 55% respectively; p < 0.02), and as accurate as CT for mediastinal extension (86% vs 85%). In the 26 SCC estimated superficial by EUS (all passed through), EUS accuracy was 92% for T stage and 77% for the distinction between mucosal and submucosal tumours; for N stage, EUS and CT accuracies were equivalent (77% vs 81%). In the 44 SCC passed and estimated advanced by EUS, EUS accuracy for T stage was 68%; EUS was more accurate than CT for N stage (77% vs 48%, p < 0.01) and as accurate as CT for mediastinal extension (86 vs 84%). In the 30 SCC not passed by EUS, accuracies of EUS and CT were equivalent for N stage (57% vs 47%) and for mediastinal extension (73% vs 73%). This study suggests that: a) for SCC estimated superficial by EUS, EUS does not differentiate reliably mucosal from submucosal tumors and CT is useless; b) routine EUS seems unnecessary for SCC not passed through by endoscopy; c) CT is still useful in patients with advanced SCC, mainly for detection of distant metastases."
CD009944,0,8535621,0,Staging of pancreatic cancer. Analysis of literature results.,Staging of pancreatic cancer is still considered to be one of the most difficult areas of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in gastroenterology. Variable scanning planes to obtain images of the tumor and its relationship to surrounding structures and vessels as well as a variety of possible artifacts in the scanning of pancreatic tumors greatly contribute to these difficulties. This review attempts to cover all relevant aspects of the literature regarding pancreatic cancer staging.
CD009944,0,8528972,0,Surgical therapy for gastric cancer.,"The aim of any surgical approach to gastric carcinoma should be a complete resection with no residual tumor left behind, that is, a R0-resection according to the UICC. Complete tumor resection in this respect refers to the primary tumor as well as the lymphatic drainage and requires an adequate safety margin. The indications for surgical therapy of gastric cancer and the choice of procedure should consequently be guided by the tumor stage. This requires accurate preoperative staging, which can today be achieved with endoscopic ultrasonography and surgical laparoscopy. Gastric carcinoma stage IA (mucosa carcinoma) can be cured by local excision. In patients with tumor stages IB (submucosa carcinoma), II, and IIIA, lymph node metastases are common. Based on the available data, this group of patients benefits from radical resection and D2 lymph node dissection. In patients with advanced gastric carcinoma, that is, tumor stages IIIB and IV, a complete tumor removal usually can not be achieved by surgical resection. Neoadjuvant therapeutic modalities should consequently be assessed in these patients. Based on tumor location and growth pattern, a total gastrectomy is the procedure of choice in patients with middle and proximal third gastric cancer. A subtotal gastrectomy may be performed in patients with tumors of the distal third and ""Laurén's intestinal type"" growth pattern. Depending on the individual tumor situation, the gastrectomy can be extended toward varying portions of the distal esophagus or a pancreas, preserving splenectomy and resection of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009944,0,7895567,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer.,"The accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for diagnosis of pancreatic cancers was evaluated in consecutive 232 patients with possible pancreatic cancer, and that for assessment of their locoregional spread was evaluated in 28 patients with pancreatic cancer subjected to pancreatectomy, in comparison with the accuracies of transabdominal ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT). EUS was found to be significantly more accurate than US or CT and was especially useful for detecting small pancreatic cancers of less than 2 cm in diameter. With EUS, pancreatic cancers could be detected as a hypoechoic mass with a relatively unclear margin and irregular internal echoes. EUS was also more sensitive than CT and US for detecting venous and gastric invasions: it was more useful for detecting direct invasion of pancreatic cancers when the tumors were less than 3 cm in diameter. These findings indicate that EUS is an accurate method for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and assessment of their locoregional spread and is particularly useful for detecting small tumors."

The subsequent operation revealed that the strip biopsy had resulted in radical resection. A 55-year-old woman visited our hospital for detailed examination of a small gastric lesion. Histologic findings of the specimens obtained by conventional forceps biopsy indicated reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, although the possibility of malignant lymphoma was not completely ruled out. Strip biopsy was, therefore, performed to establish a definitive diagnosis. Histopathological examinations of the strip biopsy specimen revealed definitive findings of malignant lymphoma, which was B-cell phenotype immunocytochemically. The margin of the resected specimen was free of invasion by malignant lymphoma and no lymph node involvement was suggested by endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography, and gallium scintigram. Subtotal gastrectomy was subsequently performed to rule out the possibility of remaining malignant lymphoma cells. It was proven that the strip biopsy removed the lesion completely and no perigastric lymph nodes were involved. While is still controversial as to whether strip biopsy should be adopted for the radical resection of early gastric lymphoma, this procedure can definitely provide excellent specimens for the accurate diagnosis of gastric malignant lymphoma and probably for group III lesions in the stomach."

In 1987 a selective proximal vagotomy was performed. Because of non-specific gastric symptoms in 1993 an endoscopy and an endoscopic ultrasound was performed at another hospital which resulted in the likely diagnosis of multiple leiomyomas. Three months later a control endosonography showed three well demarcated submucosal tumors, partly echo-genic, but with an inhomogeneous echo-pattern. A laparotomy and histological examination of the submucosal gastric tumors revealed multiple gastric abscesses with granulomas after selective proximal vagotomy. Difficulties in the differential diagnosis of submucosal gastric tumors arising from this case are demonstrated and discussed."
CD009944,0,7754626,0,Potentially resectable gastric carcinoma: current approaches to staging and preoperative therapy.,"The incidence of gastric carcinoma has declined worldwide during the past several decades, and yet this cancer remains the most common malignancy in several countries around the world, particularly Japan, Chile, and Costa Rica. Gastric carcinoma, although not as common in the United States as it was in the past, is still the eighth most frequent cause of cancer death. For patients with localized gastric carcinoma, surgery remains the most effective therapy, resulting in a consistent but low rate of cure. Unresectable gastric carcinoma is an incurable disease with the exception of a small fraction of patients who are salvaged with chemoradiotherapy. In Western countries curative resection rates have been dismal because of the lack of early diagnosis. Additionally, postoperative adjuvant strategies in the United States and Europe have been ineffective. Even patients with curative resection frequently develop intraperitoneal and systemic carcinoma in addition to locoregional relapses. Many investigators have therefore embarked on the therapeutic strategies of preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The preoperative chemotherapy strategy has particular appeal because of its potential to reduce the size of the primary tumor, thereby allowing a higher rate of curative resection; early systemic therapy of micrometastases might prove biologically more effective. To date, several studies using preoperative chemotherapy have demonstrated its feasibility. The effectiveness of repeated courses of postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy remains unsettled mainly owing to the inadequacy of peritoneal drug distribution and the associated toxic effects. Additional investigations are necessary to improve preoperative staging with the use of endoscopic ultrasonography and laparoscopy (peritoneal staging).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009944,0,7754625,0,Preoperative chemotherapy for unresectable gastric cancer.,"Even with extended surgery, including systematic lymphadenectomy of the lymph node compartment II, only half of the patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC), which comprises stages IIIA, IIIB, and IV, undergo a macroscopic and microscopic tumor-free resection (i.e., R0 resection, according to UICC 1987/AICC 1988). An improvement of this situation is best accomplished by preoperative treatment modalities to increase the R0 resection rate and by preoperative and postoperative treatment to reduce local recurrences and distant metastases. For LAGC, which includes approximately two-thirds of patients with locoregionally confined tumors, preoperative chemotherapy (CTx) represents a promising approach. Among a group of patients with surgically or clinically staged unresectable LAGC, approximately half underwent R0 resection after down-staging induced by active modern CTx. The long-term survival of these patients seems to be improved. Even in patients who had primarily unresectable tumors as defined by an explorative laparotomy, the long-term survival was about 20% after preoperative CTx and subsequent surgery. Based on these experiences, randomized trials investigating preoperative CTx versus surgery alone are clearly needed to define whether such an approach has an impact on R0 resection rates and survival of patients with LAGC. Preconditions for such trials are clinical staging procedures, including endoscopic ultrasonography (T category) and surgical laparoscopy plus lavage (excluding peritoneal carcinomatosis), and a standardized surgical procedure."
CD009944,0,7728350,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography of the pancreas.,"The pancreas is the most technically demanding area to image with EUS. This technique, however, has found a clinical niche in evaluating patients with pancreatic cancer to determine resectability and likely will play a prominent role in the future in diagnosis through ultrasonographically directed FNA. Its role in localization of neuroendocrine tumors is established as long as preoperative localization is important in management. It is unlikely that a competing technology will develop in the near future with resolution the same or better than EUS. The role of EUS in the evaluation of early chronic pancreatitis is still under investigation, but it is likely that it can play a role adjunctive to ERCP. If FNA can be demonstrated to be safe and the interpretation of the cytology is accurate, then EUS could play an important role in this area. In the future, EUS may be used to acutely aspirate pancreatic pseudocysts and potentially could be useful in differentiating pseudocysts amenable to endoscopic drainage versus those that would be managed best by percutaneous or surgical drainage. With some design modifications, it may be feasible in the future to use ultrasonographic guidance to puncture pseudocysts and then place nasocystic drains or internal stents. These areas will need further investigation and further technological development."

The overall accuracy rate of EUS in the assessment of the depth of tumor infiltration was 78%. The sensitivity and specificity of EUS in the detection of regional involved nodes were 82% and 84% respectively.

In initially negative biopsy for linitis, EUS can help the clinician in selecting the optimal site for positive biopsy. In gastric NHL, EUS can be helpful in selecting the appropriate candidate for surgery and in monitoring the response to chemotherapy and irradiation.

However, the proportion of agreement is satisfactory for distinguishing tumors that invade the mediastinal or the perirectal fat from those that do not, a situation that may be the most relevant from a therapeutic point of view. In cases of cardioesophageal tumor, agreement for metastatic LN is lower and depends on the sites involved, with the best agreement for intra-abdominal LN, which may indicate a worse prognosis.

Endoscopic therapy for early gastric cancer included strip biopsy, laser irradiation, and OK-432 injection. Examination of the depth of cancer invasion in the strip biopsy specimens showed that the diagnostic accuracy of EUS was 85.7%. Complete resection rate in strip biopsy was 82.8%, and the patients with incompletely resected cancer were successfully treated with laser irradiation and/or OK432 injection. The prognosis of the patients treated with strip biopsy was good. Three patients died of causes other than gastric cancer. Local recurrence and a heterochronous new lesion developed in six patients, but all of these cases were successfully treated with additional strip biopsy.

CD009944,0,8539469,0,[The role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis and staging of gastroenteric lymphoma].,"Ultrasonography (US) plays an important role in the diagnosis, staging and follow-up of gastrointestinal lymphomas particularly when associated with complementary techniques such as echo-guided biopsy and endoscopic ultrasonography. Besides the well-known ultrasonographic ""pseudo-kidney"" image as sign of gastrointestinal pathology, the ""spoke wheel"" image is suggestive of gastroenteric lymphoma. This lesion is due to the lymphomatous infiltration of intestinal wall that looks ipoechoic compared to the iperechoic lumen. An early abdominal US study performed after clinical suspicion, should allow a presumptive identification of the enteric tract involved on the basis of the relationship between the ""pseudokidney"" image and the other abdominal organs. US study of the abdomen may be useful also to demonstrate enlarged retroperitoneal or visceral lymph nodes both in primary gastroenteric or systemic lymphomas. Fine needle biopsy (FNB) of deep lymph nodes is mandatory when superficial enlarged lymph nodes are not found showing a specificity and sensitivity of 100% and 66% respectively. The typical image of gastric wall on endoscopic US is constituted of five layers; the second one represents the lamina propria with the lymphatic tissue. The thickness increase of this layer suggest the diagnosis of gastric lymphoma. Therefore the endoscopic US examination is particularly important when the endoscopic features and the endoscopic biopsies are negative. Finally endoscopic US may be used to guide FNB of gastrointestinal tract lesions."

CD009944,0,8174983,0,Localisation of neuroendocrine tumours of the upper gastrointestinal tract.,"In order to localise neuroendocrine tumours of the foregut type (that is, of the stomach, duodenum, and pancreas), 18 patients were studied prospectively by endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography, transabdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. These 18 patients had a total of 25 primary tumour lesions which were verified histologically in tissue obtained by surgery or by ultrasound or endoscopy guided biopsy. Tumours were found in the stomach (n = 1), duodenum (n = 6), pancreas (n = 17), and liver (n = 1). Endoscopic ultrasonography had the highest sensitivity for tumour detection, followed by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, computed tomography, transabdominal ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (88%, 52%, 36%, 32%, and 24% respectively). Endoscopic ultrasonography was especially sensitive in tumours smaller than 2 cm in diameter (88% v somatostatin receptor scintigraphy 35%; computed tomography 12%; transabdominal ultrasonography 6%; and magnetic resonance imaging 0%). Of 17 tumours located in the pancreas, endoscopic ultrasonography showed a sensitivity of 94% (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy 47%; computed tomography 47%; transabdominal ultrasonography 41%; and magnetic resonance imaging 29%). Of eight extrapancreatic tumours, six were identified by endoscopic ultrasonography, five by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, and only one by computed tomography, transabdominal ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. One neuroendocrine tumour that was not detected by endoscopic ultrasonography was correctly identified by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Endoscopic ultrasound allowed correct determination of the tumour size and tumour spread into parapancreatic structures, especially the large vessels (T stage), in all 14 patients operated upon. The lymph node stage (N stage) was correctly determined in 10 of these 14 patients. In summary, endoscopic ultrasonography and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy were the most sensitive imaging methods for the localisation of these tumours and should be used as early diagnostic procedures to accurately stage neuroendocrine tumours of the foregut type."
CD009944,0,8055243,0,"Role of endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosis, staging, and outcome of gastrointestinal diseases.","Using endoscopic ultrasound imaging, highly accurate gastrointestinal tumor characterization and staging is now possible without surgery. Precise endosonographic preoperative staging allows use of the TNM pathological staging system to stratify treatment for esophageal, gastric, rectal, and pancreatobiliary tumors. Endoscopic ultrasonography often establishes a diagnosis in malignant and, in certain patients, benign disease; accurately evaluates anastomoses for recurrent tumor; and characterizes submucosal masses. When histology is required, endoscopic ultrasonography has a critical role in defining an abnormal area for deep submucosal biopsy from the gastrointestinal lumen. Endoscopic ultrasonography is unsurpassed in determining resectability of gastrointestinal neoplasms. It can be used to monitor treatment of downstaged tumors prior to attempted resection. Using endoscopic ultrasonography for earlier diagnosis and precise staging will significantly improve the clinical outcome of patients with gastrointestinal disease as significant advances both in surgical techniques and in combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy continue to be made and applied selectively."

Endosonographically guided transmural fine-needle aspiration (EUS-guided FNA) puncture was performed in 12 patients with extrinsic mass lesions adjacent to the gastro-esophageal wall. In seven patients a malignant tumor and in four patients a benign lesion, were identified by EUS-guided FNA puncture, while in one patient no diagnostic tissue specimen could be obtained. No complications were observed. The cytological result of a malignant lesion was confirmed in six patients either by autopsy (n = 3), resection of tumor metastasis (n = 1) or by demonstration of a local recurrence of a previously histopathologically diagnosed carcinoma (n = 2), while the benign cytological results in four patients were confirmed by a follow-up period of at least 13 months (n = 3) and appropriate diagnostic tests (n = 1). It is concluded that EUS-guided FNA puncture is an efficient diagnostic technique for the assessment of malignancy and tissue diagnosis of extrinsic paragastroesophageal mass lesions. An important precondition for the successful performance of transmural EUS-guided FNA puncture is the application of endosonographic transducers with longitudinal scanning in the axis of the endoscope."

From 1990 to 1992, 33 endoscopic ultrasound investigations have been performed in 25 patients with malignant lymphomas at the Cologne University Hospital. In addition, 21 of these patients had other (conventional) diagnostic procedures at the same time serving as reference. Endoscopic ultrasound showed lymphomas in 16/21 patients, and no evidence of lymphomas in 5/21 patients. The referencial investigations together showed lymphomas in 17/21 patients, and no evidence of lymphomas in 4/21 patients. Therefore, sensitivity was 94%. 5 of the patients in addition had involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract's wall, proven by referencial investigations, which was diagnosed correctly in all cases. The pathological lymph nodes appeared mostly as echopoor, rather sharply demarcated and homogeneous. Their size was 7 mm to 55 mm in diameter, median 11 mm. The different histological types of lymphomas could not be distinguished by means of these criteria. Endoscopic ultrasound allows a detailed view at the mediastinal and epigastrical lymph node stations and may give important informations for the staging of malignant lymphomas."

Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma which are classified according to the concept of MALT (mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue) have to be differentiated from lymphoma involving secondarily the digestive tract. Primary gastric lymphoma which appear at an advanced age can be usually diagnosed endoscopic-bioptically. Representing the major prognostic factors options in the therapy of gastric lymphoma are based on the histologic grading and the stage of disease. Surgical resection and radiotherapy allow a good local tumor control while chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in case of disseminated disease or high malignancy. Characterizing the morphology and molecular biology of primary gastric lymphoma of the MALT, evaluating the role of endoscopic ultrasound in the local staging (EI1, EI2 and EII1), and optimating the therapeutic modalities are main topics of an ongoing prospective multicenter trial."
CD009944,0,7973591,0,[Endoscopic ultrasound in detection of locoregional lymph node metastases of gastrointestinal tumors].,"The locoregional lymph node status was assessed via EUS and CT in 118 patients (37 female, 81 male, average age 63.1 [37-87] years) who had histologically confirmed neoplasias in the upper GI tract. These investigations were made as part of preoperative tumour staging. Resections were performed subsequently, yielding regional lymph node metastases in 76 cases and in 23 patients only enlarged lymph nodes with benign histological findings. Overall accuracy of findings of regional lymph node metastases was 84% for oesophageal carcinomas with EUS and 57% with CT, 78% for gastric carcinomas with EUS and 46% with CT and 68% for pancreatic and ampullary carcinomas with EUS and 53% with CT. In 2 non-Hodgkin lymphomas of the stomach, paragastral malignant lymphomas were identified via EUS but not via CT. In two further cases both methods yielded false positive results. Locoregionally enlarged lymph nodes with exclusively benign histology were found in 22 of 23 cases via EUS but were misinterpreted as metastases in 15 cases. Hence, EUS is evidently superior to CT in identifying locoregional lymph node metastases. The accuracy, however, does not represent tumour status assessment made possible with the help of endosonographic criteria; rather, it is essentially due to the high degree of sensitivity of the method and the scarcity of completely benign enlargements of lymph nodes in the vicinity of neoplasias."

At the present time the following conclusions can be drawn: Submucous tumors can be clearly demonstrated and unequivocally distinguished from extramural compressions. Although the EUS aspect does not allow to differentiate benign from malignant lesions, EUS findings can give hints as to the nature of a submucous tumor (leiomyoma, lipoma, cyst). The main indication for EUS ist local tumor staging. The pT stage of esophageal carcinoma can be assessed correctly in 84% (73 to 92%) and that of gastric carcinoma in 80% (69 to 92%) of the cases by EUS. Especially in early tumor stages, EUS is superior to computed tomography. Regional lymph node metastases can be visualized in 70 to 90% of the cases. EUS is also helpful in the follow-up of patients with operative resection of esophageal cancer and in patients with gastric non-Hodgkin lymphoma during radio-/chemotherapy."

Between October 1991 and July 1993, preoperative staging with endoscopic ultrasound was performed in 45 patients with rectal carcinoma. Twenty-four received preoperative radiation therapy. For carcinoma of the middle and the lower part of rectum, the distance between the inferior pole of the tumour and the levator ani muscle was systematically measured. The ultrasound results were compared with histological and surgical findings. The staging was accurately predicted in 82.2% of cases. The depth of cancer invasion was correct in 93.3% (95.2% when preoperative radiation therapy was not applied and 79.1% after radiation therapy). Presence or absence of lymph nodes metastasis was correctly determined in 84.4% (90.5% when preoperative radiation therapy was not applied and 79.1% after radiation therapy). The distance between the inferior pole of the tumour and the levator ani muscle was correctly determined in 29/31 carcinoma of the middle and the lower part of rectum.

The main indication was locoregional staging of esophageal and cardia carcinomas, or restaging after radiotherapy or combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 37% of the patients (10 of 27) an EUS T4 carcinoma was diagnosed, and in 63% (17/27) an EUS-T3 one. Regional lymph-node metastases were diagnosed in 96% of the cases. EUS restaging after nonsurgical palliative treatment detected tumor lesions in three of eight patients. Despite the fact that the imaging quality is still not satisfactory, our results suggest that the limitations of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) examination due to stenosing tumor growth can be overcome by the use of this ultrasonic esophagoprobe or similar instruments. Further technical developments may improve the resolution as well as the imaging quality in the celiac axis region."

Data from 63 patients with esophageal cancer and 147 patients with gastric cancer who underwent surgery were available for comparison of the endosonographic TNM classification to the histophathological findings of the resected specimens. The overall accuracy of EUS in the assessment of tumor infiltration depth was 85.7% and 78% in esophageal and gastric cancer, respectively. The sensitivity of EUS in the detection of regional lymph node metastases was 90% in esophageal and 87% in gastric carcinoma.

CD009944,0,8508381,0,New staging techniques. Endoscopic ultrasound.,"Rectal ultrasonography allows detailed images of rectal tumors and provides the most accurate method of staging rectal cancer. Ultrasound assessment of the extent of tumor invasion and lymph node involvement is superior to computed tomography (CT) scan, though CT is still the best method to assess liver involvement. Ultrasound assessment of cancers above the peritoneal reflection is less useful clinically because it currently does not alter management. Outcome studies have not been reported using ultrasound to stage rectal cancer but should be forthcoming. Inflammation present at the leading edge of the tumor is the greatest cause for overstaging, and difficulty in determining tumor involvement into, but not through, the muscularis propria is another important cause of inaccurate staging. Lymph node assessment can be problematic, but future developments in ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology holds promise for more accurate assessment of lymph node status. Surgery will remain the standard method to treat rectal cancer, but new methods, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound, may provide new ways to treat some patients."

At the present time the following conclusions can be drawn: Intramural tumors can be clearly visualized and differentiated from extragastric conditions by EUS. Pancreatic tumors smaller than 2 cm can be delineated exactly by EUS and the sensitivity of EUS in demonstrating pancreatic tumors is 90%, a fact which is especially helpful in the early diagnosis of endocrine tumors. Since the endosonographic aspect does not allow us to separate unequivocally benign from malignant alterations, a clear distinction between inflammatory (pseudo) tumors and neoplastic pancreatic lesions based on EUS findings alone is not possible. The main indication for EUS is in regional TN-staging. The pT-stage of esophageal cancers can be determined correctly in 84% (73-92), of gastric carcinomas in 80% (69-92), of pancreatic cancers in 90% (88-92) and of the distal common bile duct and of papilla of Vater in 85% (83-89) of cases. EUS is superior to computed tomography, especially in early tumor stages. The correct EUS-staging of proximal bile duct tumors and of gallbladder cancer is far more difficult, especially when the latter is filled with stones. Local lymph node metastases are visualized by EUS in about 70-90% of cases. EUS is also valuable in evaluation of the anastomosis after operative resection of esophageal or gastric carcinoma, as well as in the follow-up of patients with gastric non-Hodgkin lymphomas during radiochemotherapy."

Although EUS was accurate in determining the absence of lymph node metastases (accuracy in stage N0: 93%), it was not reliable in determining stages N1 and N2 (64% and 52%, respectively). Since 88% of all T3 and T4 tumors had lymph node metastases, the concomitant T stage may be an important criterion for assessing the nature of endosonographically visualized lymph nodes. The actual R0-resection rate (78%) was almost identical to the rate predicted preoperatively by EUS (81%).

Sixty-four patients suspected of pancreatic cancer were studied prospectively, and the results of imaging techniques were compared to histology and surgical exploration. There were 49 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 11 of pancreatitis, 2 of common bile duct carcinoma, 1 lymphoma and 1 hepatocellular carcinoma with peripancreatic metastatic lymph nodes. EUS was significantly more accurate (91%) than CT (66%) and US (64%) for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. EUS was able to image all 7 cancers less than 25 mm in diameter, US and CT only one. There were 4 false positives with EUS which were all cases of pseudotumorous pancreatitis. For detecting lymph node involvement, EUS was significantly more sensitive (62%) and accurate (74%) than US (8% and 37%) and CT (19% and 42%), respectively. Invaded lymph nodes adjacent to large tumors and micrometastatic involvement were responsible for this lack of sensitivity. EUS was significantly more sensitive (100%) than CT (71%) and US (17%) for detecting venous involvement. The specificity of EUS was lower (67%) because of duodenal bulb stenosis and large tumors. In conclusion, this prospective and comparative study confirms that EUS is an accurate tool for diagnosis and locoregional spread assessment of pancreatic cancer when performed in a reference center. EUS is of particular interest for small tumours. However, EUS does not enable differentiation of pseudotumorous pancreatitis from adenocarcinoma."

Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was used to assess the horizontal extent of cancerous invasion below the mucosal layer. In 105 patients (110 lesions) with gastric carcinoma, ultrasonographic images of resected specimens were compared with histological findings. The horizontal extent of the hypoechoic region of in vitro ultrasound was compared with the horizontal extent of the cancerous invasion and fibrosis in histological sections. In cases showing echo patterns characteristic of peptic ulcerations within the tumor focus, the horizontal spread of the echo-poor region correlated well with the spread of fibrosis, but not with the cancerous lesion. In other cases with no ulceration, the horizontal spread of the echo-poor region corresponded well with the cancerous lesions. To evaluate oral invasion of the cancerous lesion below the mucosa, 16 patients with gastric carcinoma who had clips placed during endoscopy were subsequently examined by EUS. The use of EUS combined with the clips allowed for a more accurate diagnosis of the invasion, not only in the mucosa, but also into the submucosa and beyond. This combined diagnostic method was safe and useful for determining a suitable surgical resection line."

Based on the longitudinal tumor extent (antrum to fundus), as assessed by preoperative (n = 10) and additionally, intraoperative EUS (n = 3), partial gastric resection was performed in nine patients and total gastrectomy in one. All resection specimens had tumor-free resection margins (R0 resection rate 100%). These results were compared to those in 23 patients with gastric NHL operated on prior to the introduction of EUS in the hospital who were comparable with respect to tumor location and extent. In comparison with the ten cases where treatment was guided by EUS, the rate of total gastrectomy was higher (65% versus 10%) and the R0 resection rate lower (72% versus 100%) in this group of 23 patients.

On EUS, three types of PGL could be differentiated, a superficial type (n = 10), an infiltrating type (n = 12) and a tumorous type (n = 2). In the correct assessment of surface extension of the tumors, endoscopy and EUS agreed in 37.5% of cases and EUS showed more extensive disease than endoscopy in 58% of cases. However, in comparison to the resection specimens, EUS still underestimated the tumor surface extension in 37.5% of cases; this was mainly in low grade malignant PGL. The depth of tumor infiltration was correctly determined on EUS compared to the resection specimens in 91.5% of cases. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of diagnosing lymph node metastases were 100%, 80% and 83%, respectively.

While many publications report about the merits of conventional imaging for this type of pathology, few authors have considered ultrasonographic endoscopy, and even fewer magnetic resonance imaging. The authors present one case for which these two recent techniques were implemented, as well as a review of the literature."
CD009944,0,8261991,0,Echoendoscopy prior to endoscopic tumor therapy--more safety?,"Echoendoscopy has been found useful to better define gastrointestinal tract tumors which may be suitable for endoscopic treatment. In benign tumors, echoendoscopy may be used to decrease the risk of hemorrhage or perforation before resection of large polyps or submucosal lesions. The most important indications for echoendoscopy, however, are in the field of GI oncology, and the method may lead to a better selection of superficial cancers without lymph node metastases. However, endoscopic ultrasound is still limited in differentiating mucosal from submucosal tumors and in the detection and interpretation of small lymph nodes. Technical improvements and careful interpretation of echoendoscopy will increase the number of patients cured by non-surgical procedures in the future."
CD009944,0,8251741,0,[Endosonography of the gastrointestinal tract--an assessment of current status].,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) combines endoscopy and ultrasonography. A small ultrasonic transducer incorporated into the rigid tip of endoscopes is transported into certain regions of the upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract under visual control. The method allows for a high-resolution imaging of the gastrointestinal wall and organs and structures in its immediate vicinity. This is especially valuable in the preoperative local staging of gastrointestinal malignancies (esophagus, stomach, pancreas, biliary tract, colon and rectum) according to the new TNM system. In patients without distant metastases EUS helps guiding treatment decisions. EUS is also used with clinical benefit in the diagnosis of submucosal tumors and in the preoperative localization of pancreatic endocrine tumors. Its role in the diagnosis and management of benign gastroenterological disorders has still to be established."

CD009944,0,8243932,0,[Guided puncture-cytology under electronic sectorial ultrasound endoscopy. Results in 26 patients].,"The diagnosis of submucosal tumors, extrinsic lesions of gastrointestinal tract and mediastinal or celiac masses can be made by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) but histological confirmation (benign or malignant lesion) is still required. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a new method, enabling EUS (curved array transducer)--guided fine needle aspiration of deep lesions. From October 1991 to August 1992, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration was performed in 26 patients in whom a mediastinal mass (6 cases), mediastinal lymph nodes (4 cases), submucosal tumor (5 cases), extrinsic masses (4 cases) and large fold gastric disease with negative endoscopic biopsy (7 cases) was detected by EUS. Diagnostic results were obtained in 19 of 26 patients (73.1%). A malignant tumor was detected in 21 of 26 patients. The EUS-guided fine needle aspiration was positive in 16 cases. The sensitivity for diagnosis of malignancy was 76.2% while specificity was 100%. The development of this new technique in the future needs further study."
CD009944,0,1732981,1,Regional lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer: evaluation with endoscopic US.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed in 83 patients with gastric cancer to evaluate regional lymph node metastasis. Histopathologic findings were compared with preoperative EUS findings in a total of 1,519 resected lymph nodes. In lymph node staging, the prevalence of metastatic adenopathy was 31.3% (26 of 83 patients); EUS had an accuracy of 83.1% (69 of 83 patients), sensitivity of 53.8% (14 of 26 patients), specificity of 96.5% (55 of 57 patients), positive predictive value of 87.5% (14 of 16 patients), and negative predictive value of 82.1% (55 of 67 patients). The greater the maximum diameter of the node with metastasis, or the larger the ratio of the metastatic area to the cross-sectional area of the node, the higher the detection rate. In tumors classified on the basis of depth of invasion according to the 1987 TNM system, the rate of detection of metastasis in individual nodes was 0% in pT1 tumors (none of five nodes), 20% in pT2 tumors (17 of 85 nodes), 29% in pT3 tumors (20 of 70 nodes), and 10% in pT4 tumors (three of 31 nodes). It is concluded that the most important use of EUS will be in diagnosis of regional lymph node metastasis."
CD009944,0,1641613,0,[Reoperation in colorectal carcinoma with curative intention].,"From the surgical point of view it may be helpful to adopt the following guidelines in the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally recurrent colorectal cancer: 1. A gastroenterologist concerned with oncological patients should initiate adequate resectional treatment of the primary tumor. 2. In case of locoregional recurrences, every diagnostic effort (endoscopy, intraluminal ultrasound, angiogram, CT-scan, MRI) should be made to select patients with limited and resectable disease. 3. In patients with liver metastases amenable to surgical resection it is mandatory to rule out extrahepatic disease preoperatively as far as possible. 4. Prognostic factors deriving from tumor-biological data, extent of recurrent disease, and laboratory findings (CEA) must be taken into consideration when the decision whether to operate is to be made. These arguments should also be used to support non-operative treatment in patients with a type of recurrence that cannot be cured by surgery. 5. Postoperatively, all information (intraoperatively detected extrahepatic disease, tumor infiltrated resection margins, CEA not returning to normal levels) should be combined to classify patients according to whether they carry a high risk for a second tumor recurrence and should thus undergo additional treatment. In a ""low-risk situation"", further follow-up seems to be adequate."
CD009944,0,1633775,0,Application of ultrasonic probes prior to endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer.,"The development of a new strip biopsy technique for endoscopic mucosectomy utilizing endoscopic saline injection and a double-channel endoscope permits the safe and simple resection of superficial type early gastric cancer which has been difficult to perform with conventional polypectomy techniques. Preresection assessment of the depth of invasion and postresection assessment of efficacy are important with regard to treatment of early gastric cancer, but conventional endoscopic ultrasonography employed for this purpose requires special equipment and involves intricate procedures. An ultrasonic probe which can be used endoscopically has recently been developed and is currently in the trial stage. The authors have conducted studies with respect to a 7.5 MHz radial scanning type Miniature Ultrasonic Probe as well as a 20 MHz manual linear scanning type Sonoprobe System. Experimental studies indicated that the former type is capable of delineating postresection ulcers, while the latter permitted delineation of tumors as hypoechoic images in 9 of 11 cases of early gastric cancer."

Only those cases with subsequent histologic examination of the resected specimen were entered into the study. Sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was 90% for esophageal and 87% for gastric cancer. The specificity was 72% and 88%, respectively.

The great strength of EUS in staging these cancers is its ability to image the gut wall and adjacent structures in unique detail. EUS is more accurate than computed tomography in staging the depth of primary tumor invasion (T) and regional lymph node metastases (N). High frequency EUS is not useful in staging for distant metastases (M) due to limited depth of the field. EUS also has limitations in reliably distinguishing between neoplastic and inflammatory tissue. Thus, the major use of EUS is in staging rather than in diagnosis. However, initial reports indicate that EUS may be helpful in the detection of malignancy in Barrett's esophagus, in diagnosing post-operative recurrent cancer, and in evaluating the response to non-operative therapy. EUS appears to represent an important advance in the staging and follow-up of patients with esophageal and gastric cancer. Instruments and techniques will continue to evolve, but the next level of research should be designed to show that the improved staging provided by EUS has clinical utility and can affect patient outcome."

An accurate staging by diagnostic radiology is the cornerstone in planning radiation therapy. Especially in estimating the T- and N-stage as well as the primary diagnosis in esophagus-, gastric and rectal cancer endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound is the method of choice. When planning radiation therapy barium studies of the esophagus and contrast enema of the colon are important. Only in the case of gastric lymphoma an upper gastrointestinal series is necessary. In the case of suspected recurrent rectal cancer CT-guided biopsy distinguishes between tumor recurrence and reactive fibrosis."

The findings were made prospectively and independently of each other. EUS proved to be superior to transabdominal US and to CT in the diagnosis of tumour infiltration of the portal and splenic veins. For the portal vein the sensitivity was 93% by EUS, 14% by US and 36% by CT. Corresponding figures for the splenic vein were 92%, 39% and 69%. EUS was markedly superior to angiography in the diagnosis of portal vein involvement (sensitivity of 93% and 36%, respectively), but the two methods had similar sensitivity regarding splenic vein infiltration (92 and 100%). Tumour involvement of the coeliac trunk was diagnosed with higher sensitivity angiographically (86%) than by EUS (57%), CT (71%) or US (29%). Regarding T and N staging, EUS was superior to both US and CT. These data indicate that EUS is the most accurate method for local tumour staging of potentially resectable pancreatic carcinoma. It can replace angiography in the diagnosis of portal vein infiltration."
CD009944,0,1544564,0,Diffuse heterotopic submucosal cystic malformation of the stomach: ultrasonographic diagnosis.,The preoperative diagnosis of diffuse heterotopic submucosal cystic malformation of the stomach is very difficult to make with upper gastrointestinal (GI) series or endoscopy.

CD009944,0,1509787,0,[Endosonography in gastroenterology--an intermediate evaluation].,Endoscopic ultrasonography has widened the diagnostic spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders in two respects: For the first time it became possible to visualize the gastrointestinal wall with its layer structure. EUS was shown to be highly accurate in the local staging of gastrointestinal tumors (T and N stage). The clinical relevance of endosonography derives from stage-dependent treatment protocols selecting patients for different forms of tumor therapy. The second advantage of endosonography is a high-resolution imaging of the pancreas enabling the detection of small lesions (e.g. endocrine tumors). Endoscopic ultrasonography is furthermore the most reliable method for local staging of pancreatic and ampullary carcinoma. The role of endosonography in benign gastroenterological disorders is less well established. With the increasing use of laparoscopic surgery endosonography may become even more important in the future.
CD009944,0,1500662,0,Heterotopic pancreas diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic injection of ethanol to make a histologic diagnosis.,A gastric submucosal tumor in a 56-year-old man was presumed to be heterotopic pancreas on the basis of endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography. To obtain a histologic diagnosis we injected ethanol at the tumor site to create an artificial ulcer. This facilitated the removal of endoscopic biopsy specimens from the submucosal layer so that histologic examination could confirm the presence of heterotopic pancreatic tissue.
CD009944,0,1479865,0,[Endosonography of stomach tumors].,"Based on own experience and on the published literature we report about indications and efficiency of endosonography (EUS) in gastric tumors. The following conclusions can be drawn at the present time. Submucous tumors can be clearly differentiated from extragastric compressions. Although the endosonographic aspect does not allow to formulate an etiologic diagnosis, EUS findings can give hints regarding the nature of the submucous tumor (e.g. leiomyoma, lipoma, cyst). In 75% of cases malignant submucous tumors can be visualized and a correct preoperative staging can be performed. EUS is of special importance in the description of gastric carcinoma. The pT stage can be correctly determined preoperatively in about 80% (69-92%) of cases. Accompanying inflammation in early gastric cancer can lead to overstaging. The sensitivity for local lymph node metastases reaches about 77% (50-88%). Gastric non-Hodgkin lymphomas can be excellently visualized with EUS. The sensitivity amounts to 90-100% and in about 90% of cases the extent of the tumor can be correctly determined preoperatively. The response to radio-chemotherapy of gastric non-Hodgkin lymphomas can be monitored easily with the method. At the present time EUS is the most sensitive imaging tool in visualizing and staging of gastric tumors. Its main advantage is the exact demonstration of intramural and paragastric alterations. However, despite the use of high ultrasonic frequencies and the excellent demonstration of even tiny details with EUS, biopsies for histologic evaluation are still mandatory, especially when dealing with gastric ulcer."

CD009944,0,1463259,1,[Preoperative staging of gastric carcinoma using endosonography (EUS)].,"Accurate staging of gastric malignancy can only be obtained at surgery and after detailed histological examination of the resection specimen. Endoscopic ultrasonography may provide accurate detection and staging of gastric cancer because of its ability to visualize both the intramural and extramural extent of the lesion and any adjacent lymph node involvement. From february 90 to april 91, 29 patients with a gastric carcinoma were studied endosonographically before surgery. All studies were performed with an Olympus EU-M3. Preoperative TNM classification and a prediction of the resectability of gastric cancer were done in every patient. The results were matched with those obtained with the histology of resected specimens according to the TNM classification 1987. Endoscopic ultrasonography was accurate in assessing the extent and depth of tumor infiltration. The overall accuracy rate was 90.5% (19 out of 21 patients). Overstaging occurred in 9.5% of the cases (2 patients); none understaging occurred. EUS was less accurate in assessment of lymph node metastasis; the overall accuracy rate was 57.1%. Distinction between reactive lymph node and small micrometastatic lymph node involvement could be hard. Local resectability was correctly diagnosed with EUS in each of 23 patients; in two patients an intramural mass with a deep infiltration into the surrounding tissue was correctly diagnosed. In our opinion EUS is an essential diagnostic procedure in the clinical staging of the gastric cancer."

A diagnosis of primary gastric lymphoma was confirmed by endoscopy and results of abrasive cytology. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), performed prior to surgery, demonstrated clearly the submucosal invasion of the gastric lymphoma. Histopathology on the depth and the involvement of perigastric lymph nodes of surgical specimen confirmed the accuracy of the EUS findings.

CD009944,0,2040468,1,Preoperative evaluation of gastric cancer by endoscopic ultrasound.,"The preoperative use of endoscopic ultrasound was evaluated in 74 patients with confirmed gastric cancer. It was used in diagnosing the depth of invasion in the gastric wall, the infiltration to the adjacent organs, and the involvement of the perigastric lymph nodes. Results were compared with histological findings in resected specimens. Accuracy in staging gastric cancer using the T grade of the 1987 TNM system was 81.1% (60 of 74 patients). Endoscopic ultrasound provided excellent results compared with computed tomography and conventional ultrasound, particularly in evaluating perigastric lymph node metastasis and direct infiltration to the adjacent organs. The success rate in detecting lymph node metastasis was 50% (11 of 22 patients); the accuracy in diagnosing direct infiltration to the adjacent organs was 60% (three of five patients). This technique is useful in diagnosing malignant invasion and lymph node metastasis of gastric carcinomas but requires further refinement for use in diagnosing the disease itself.

EUS was performed in 11 patients with primary gastric lymphoma who subsequently underwent gastrectomy with lymph node dissection, as well as chemotherapy in some cases. EUS findings showed a good correlation with the histopathology of the resected specimens. An accurate diagnosis of the depth of invasion into the gastric wall was made in 10 of 11 patients using the same T grade of the 1987 TNM system for gastric carcinoma. EUS also clearly visualized the reduction of depth of tumor invasion in two patients who underwent chemotherapy.

In conclusion, EUS is an excellent and sensitive diagnostic modality for the preoperative staging and follow-up of primary gastric lymphoma."
CD009944,0,2028957,0,A limitation of endoscopic ultrasound: an unusual case of early gastric cancer overlying a pancreatic rest.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has been developed as a valuable tool for examining the depth of carcinoma invasion and evaluating the submucosal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. In the present case, that of a 60-yr-old woman, the work-up of radiography and conventional endoscopy revealed an ulcerating cancer of the stomach. Subsequent EUS showed a solid high-echoic mass occupying the third (submucosal) and fourth (muscularis propria) layers of gastric wall, suggestive of an advanced cancer invading the muscularis propria. However, histologic examination of the surgical specimen showed that this tumor was early submucosal carcinoma confined to the surface of a pancreatic rest. Retrospective evaluation of EUS pictures proved that the mass had tubular or circular echoless structures associated with thickening of the fourth layer, suggesting the pancreatic rest. Our experience in reviewing EUS findings of this tumor seems noteworthy, inasmuch as EUS indicates that EUS may provide certain characteristic features of gastric pancreatic rest that should be differentiated from invading carcinoma."
CD009944,0,1991632,0,Evaluation of endosonography in TN staging of oesophageal cancer.,"Strategies for the treatment of cancer of the oesophagus depend on the tumour stage at the time of diagnosis. Resection, the only curative treatment, is confined to early tumour stages. Tumours with local infiltration are usually unresectable and require palliative treatment. Computed tomography has been widely used for preoperative staging but often fails to define this correctly. Endoscopic ultrasound allows direct visualisation of the parietal wall and may be useful in staging gastrointestinal tumours. In a comparative prospective study, 52 patients with tumours of the oesophagus were investigated preoperatively both by endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography to determine the stage of tumour infiltration and local lymph node involvement. Thirty seven of these patients underwent operation, resection, or dissection and entered the study. The intraoperative findings or the histopathological assessment, or both, were taken as a reference. For all TN stages of oesophageal tumours, correct preoperative staging was accomplished by endoscopic ultrasound in 89% for T stage and 69% for N stage compared with 51% and 51% respectively by computed tomography (highly significant using Fisher's exact test). This study shows that endoscopic ultrasound is useful in preoperative TN staging of tumours of the oesophagus."
CD009944,0,1991278,0,Primary neoplasms of the hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Staging and follow-up.,"The number of imaging modalities available to stage and follow-up patients with primary neoplasms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract continues to increase. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography are useful techniques for both staging and follow-up. For staging, CT is most frequently used for the detection of liver metastases and is increasingly used as a substitute for the chest radiograph in the detection of lung metastases. CT is still the imaging test of choice for the preoperative staging of esophageal carcinoma. CT is less helpful in staging the patient with gastric carcinoma or colorectal carcinoma. The current usefulness of MRI in the staging of GI tract malignancies is limited by the lack of an adequate oral intraluminal contrast agent and degradation of images due to motion. Sonography, especially the new technique of endoscopic ultrasound, is promising for the detection of local invasion from GI tract malignancies. CT is used in the follow-up of patients with tumors of the GI tract to detect liver, adrenal, and nodal metastases as well as local recurrence because of the ability of CT to detect extraluminal masses. CT of the pelvis has been recommended as a routine follow-up procedure in patients who have undergone abdominal-peroneal resection. Both CT and MRI can be used to detect local recurrence, but suffer from the inability to differentiate scar from recurrent tumor. The initial hope that MRI would be capable of differentiating postoperative scar tissue from recurrent tumor has not been realized. Therefore, with positive CT or MRI findings, occasionally a percutaneous biopsy will be required to confirm local recurrence."

The results were correlated with the histology of resected specimens. EUS was accurate in assessing the depth of tumor infiltration. Over all accuracy of EUS for cardiac cancer was 90%. Recognition of ultrasonographic patterns had enabled us to judge the mode of tumor infiltration whether expansive or infiltrative. Microscopical spread over 5 mm to the esophagus of the cardiac cancer could be detected by EUS.

The normal gastric wall has a five-layer structure on EUS. In 19 lesions, changes on EUS were limited to the first and/or second layers, suggesting that invasion was limited within the mucosa. In 91 lesions, changes were evident in the third or deeper layers. Alterations in the EUS appearance could be divided into two types: type A, with destruction of the layered structure and type B with thickening of the layers. The amount of interstitial tissue in cancer was classified as medullary or intermediate in 90% of type A, and as scirrhous in 82% of type B tumor. The EUS diagnosis of invasion was 95% accurate for stage M cancers, 75% for SM, 64% for PM, 100% for SS, 79% for SE, and 100% for SI lesions. The overall accuracy was 81%.

CD009944,0,1860438,1,Analysis of gastric carcinoma growth by endoscopic ultrasonography.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed preoperatively in 82 patients with gastric carcinoma (40 with early and 42 advanced malignancy). Measurements of wall thickness were performed in each case and showed good correlation with histological findings. Wall thickening was found to consist of both tumorous and accompanying ulcerous tissue. Thus, increasing wall thickness, as demonstrated by EUS, may not necessarily mean progressive tumor growth. The EUS features of gastric carcinoma were analyzed and four distinct growth patterns found: predominantly intramural (IM) or intraluminal (IL) growth with preservation (Type 1) or destruction (Type 2) of the submucosal echo-rich layer. All early carcinomas displayed the IL-type growth pattern on EUS (98% IL1-type) and 81% of advanced tumors showed IM-type features. EUS was able to differentiate between early and advanced carcinoma in 98% of cases. The EUS pattern of submucosal destruction (type IM2 or IL2) corresponded to the expanding type tumor according to Ming's histopathological classification. On the other hand, 24 of 26 infiltrative tumors according to Ming were found on EUS to have an intramural growth pattern with preservation of the submucosa (type IM1). It is concluded that EUS is highly sensitive in predicting the tumor growth pattern in gastric carcinoma, providing important additional information to the currently used TNM staging system. Measurements of wall thickness are reliable but differentiation between tumorous growth and peritumorous changes is not possible."
CD009944,0,1854986,0,Endoscopic ultrasonography of the upper gastrointestinal tract.,"EUS unites two established imaging techniques and extends the range of observation into and beyond the wall of the GI tract. The close proximity of the sonographic probe to the region of interest combined with high ultrasonic frequencies of between 7.5 and 12 MHz yields images of high resolution. EUS is used in the staging of benign and malignant neoplastic disorders of the oesophagus, stomach, pancreas and extrahepatic bile ducts. It helps to establish operability, to plan surgical approach, to follow response to therapy and to search for recurrence. The predictive value in defining the T and N stages of oesophageal carcinoma lies between 80 and 90% and 65 and 85%, respectively. It is clearly superior to CT in tumour stages T1 and T2. In gastric cancer, resectability based on the TNM staging system can be correctly assessed by EUS in 85% of cases and EUS detection and staging of early gastric cancer reaches an accuracy of 90%. The EUS accuracy rate for resectability of pancreatic carcinoma is 83% and tumour infiltration into the portal and splenic vein can be correctly determined by EUS in 94% and 67%, respectively. A reliable EUS differentiation between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma based on the echo pattern and outer margins is not possible. The development of EUS-guided needle biopsy should improve the specificity of EUS in this regard. Experience to data suggests as well that EUS will assume an important place in the staging of bile duct tumours. EUS has expanded our endoscopic and sonographic capabilities and it is to be hoped that further technical improvement, e.g. the construction of forward-viewing endoscopes combined with radial scanning devices, will contribute to a widespread use of this technique by gastroenterologists."

The choice of total gastrectomy with the standardized dissection of regional lymph nodes in order to treat multicentric or upper gastric malignancies v.s. distal gastrectomy for antral lesions is discussed. The cumulative survival rate was 84.4%; local recurrence rate was 4.2%."

Preoperative findings of each diagnostic tools were compared with histological findings. In order to discuss the effectiveness of each body imagings, the preoperative staging of pancreatic cancer was evaluated in direct invasion to the anterior pancreatic capsule and stomach (S), direct invasion to the duodenum (D), direct invasion to the retroperitoneal adjacent vessels (Rp), and regional lymph node metastasis (N). The overall accuracy rate was 77% with EUS (50% with US, 38% with CT, 56% with Angio) in S, 81% with EUS (44% with US, 38% with CT, 63% with Angio) in D, 77% with EUS (58% with US, 42% with CT, 73% with Angio) in Rp, and 65% with EUS (58% with US, 38% with CT) in N. EUS revealed high accuracy rates because EUS images of the whole pancreas, surrounding organs and major vessels were clearly visualized through the gastroduodenal walls. Also, the accuracy rates of Angio in Rp and US in N were almost the same as those of EUS in Rp and N. However, it was difficult for every procedure to diagnose the retroperitoneal perineural invasion. From these results, EUS is one of the most beneficial procedures for detecting of the extent of cancer. EUS is expected to be popularized in the diagnosis and staging of the pancreatic cancer."

Symptoms are non-specific. At endoscopy three main patterns can be recognized: ulceration, diffuse infiltration, or a polypoid mass. Endoscopic biopsy results may be false-negative (up to 8%) owing to submucosal localization. The new technique of endoscopic ultrasonography is accurate in measuring depth of infiltration and regional lymph nodes. Preoperative diagnosis altered the indication for surgery. Without resection an excellent local tumour control (stage I, 85%, and stage II, 69%) can be achieved, leading to a fair prognosis: 5-year relapse free survival in stage I, 83%, and in stage II, 58%. Intra-abdominal recurrences were scarce (2%), and severe complications such as perforation and life-threatening haemorrhage were seldom present (4%). Thus, resection is not necessary, but early recognition is highly significant. Favourable results can be achieved by irradiation or chemotherapy with irradiation."

EUS is especially sensitive in the local tumor staging in esophageal, gastric, pancreatic and ampullary carcinoma (accuracy rates 80-90%). Lymph node metastases are correctly identified in 70-80%. This also applies to the rectal cancer employing rigid instruments. Experience with colonic endosonography is still too limited to permit any definitive conclusions.

EUS is therefore a valuable diagnostic tool für assessment of prognosis as well as for planning of therapy of these tumors. Its value in benign gastroenterologic disease is unclear.

A special guillotine biopsy device (Flexi-Temno) which enables collection of adequate submucosal samples by the endoscopic approach was therefore evaluated. After visualization by EUS the guillotine needle biopsy was performed in 21 patients with submucosal tumors of the stomach. There were 2 failures in 2 patients with leiomyomas. The diagnosis suggested by EUS was confirmed by guillotine biopsy in 17 cases. Guillotine biopsy detected 2 cases of unsuspected leiomyosarcoma which were confirmed surgically. In cases of solid submucosal tumors confirmed on EUS, the guillotine needle biopsy enables a definitive histologic diagnosis. Thus malignancies can be detected when EUS findings are not significant."

To date, fiberoptic endoscopy has yet to change this seemingly inexorable fact. Nevertheless, endoscopy plays a vital role in the evaluation and diagnosis of the gastric cancer patient and provides palliative options to patients suffering from advanced disease that may not respond to other modalities. With the advent of endoscopic screening protocols identifying cases at an early stage, there is early epidemiologic evidence of impact on the mortal consequences of this disease in high incidence areas such as Japan. Endoscopic ultrasound, flow cytometry of endoscopic biopsies, and photodynamic techniques offer the prospect of increasing definition of gastric malignancy prior to therapy, and new endoscopic therapies await further study to define their potential role in treating early cancer non-operatively. Twenty years ago, scientists intent on the study of gastric neoplasia played a major role in the advent of fiberoptic endoscopy. To date, their reward has been a wealth of information. As this material is digested and applied, it seems reasonable to believe their efforts may be eventually rewarded by a reduction in the epidemiologic impact of this disease, brought about not by changing global incidence patterns, but by knowledge and technology derived and administered endoscopically."

As far as the gastrointestinal tract is concerned, endoscopically controlled ultrasonic probes provide visualization of the various layers of the intestinal wall. It is therefore possible to describe lesions of the esophagus, stomach, and the rectum with regard to their nature and depth of infiltration. Furthermore, periesophageal and perigastric organs can be visualized. It has become evident that endosonography is particularly important for pretherapeutic staging of tumors of the esophagus, stomach, and rectum. Here prospective comparative studies confirm the superiority of this new diagnostic procedure when compared to the methods available to date."

In all 64 cases, resected specimens (formalin fixed) were subjected to endoscopic ultrasonographic examination by the water immersion method in order to assess the horizontal spread of the invasive gastric cancer. Ultrasonographic findings were compared with the histopathological findings of resected specimens. The tumor which invaded the submucosa or deeper layers was visualized as low echogenicity region in the third layer (corresponding to the submucosa) or deeper layers. The horizontal spread of the low echogenicity region represented that of the tumor or the associated fibrosis, but not the tumor itself. In the cases showing echo patterns which were characteristic of the peptic ulceration in the tumor focus (Type II-1, II-2, UL), the horizontal spread of cancer invasion in the submucosal layer or deeper layers (L Ca) was smaller than that of low echogenicity region depicted by ultrasonography (L U). In the other (Type II-3, III, A, B) cases, L Ca was almost comparable to L U."

Organs examined were the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, ampulla, pancreas, common bile duct, and gallbladder. There were 18 staging exams of known neoplasms, and 24 examinations to evaluate possible mass. Forty-three examinations were successful, four failed due to instrument malfunction, and three were technical failures. Among 35 exams for masses, follow-up pathology was available in 21 and confirmed EUS findings in 90%. EUS yielded additional information, not available by other imaging studies, in 60% of successful exams. No complications were seen. The recent literature is reviewed in approximately 2000 patients. We conclude that EUS is an accurate and safe method for evaluating upper gastrointestinal pathology, particularly for staging neoplasms."

Endoscopic ultrasonography was always performed after axial-vision fiberscopy anal routine biopsy specimens were obtained. Computed tomography was also done in all cases of extrinsic compression. Distinction between subepithelial tumor and extrinsic compression was made in all patients by endoscopic ultrasonography and in 5 cases by fiberscopic examination with biopsy specimens. Localization and intramural spread of subepithelial tumors were correctly determined in 12 of 13 cases by endoscopic ultrasonography (diagnostic accuracy: 92 percent). The echoendoscopic semiology of 21 subepithelial tumors was retrospectively established. The histologic nature of some of these tumors can be suggested by these signs. Endoscopic ultrasonography is superior to computed tomography in the evaluation of esogastric extrinsic compressions, particularly in the diagnosis of posterior mediastinal carcinomatosis and of tumoral invasion of the deep parietal layers. We conclude that endoscopic ultrasonography is currently the best procedure in the assessment of subepithelial tumors and extrinsic compressions of the esophagus and the stomach."

Recently, the new technique of endoscopic ultrasonography was used to measure depth of infiltration and regional lymph nodes. Preoperative diagnosis altered the indication of surgery. Since 1978 surgical staging was performed in only 29% of the patients compared to 90% in the earlier period. In the later period stage II was more systematically treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Over the whole period patients in stage I (n = 52) had a 5 year disease-free survival of 63%. In stage II 38% had a 5 year disease-free survival. Complications were one perforation and one haemorrhage after radiotherapy and two cases of haemorrhage after radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy. Intraabdominal recurrences were found in two cases. Recognition of endoscopic features may lead to early detection and ultimately improved survival."

We used endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and Submucosography (SMG) to diagnose the depth of cancer invasion and compared their efficacy against 63 lesions in 60 cases of gastric and esophageal cancers. SMG could diagnose the invasion correctly in 97% of m (mucosa) cancers, 88% of sm (submucosa) cancers and 100% of advanced cancers. On the other hand, linear-type EUS could diagnose the cancer invasion correctly in 60% of the m cancers, 83% of the sm cancers and 100% of advanced cancers. The results of the comparison of radial-type EUS and SMG showed similar results. Both EUS and SMG are appropriate for the judgement of endoscopic treatments. However, for the selection of the indication of endoscopic treatment which is applied to relatively small sized lesions in general, SMG appears to be superior to EUS in both resolution power and accuracy in shooting."

Comparison was made between the depth of the changes shown in the multi-layered image produced by ultrasonography and the actual depth of invasion. Cases showing ultrasonographic changes extending deeper than the actual tumor were found to have fibrosis associated with peptic ulceration within the tumor focus. In such cases the echo images chiefly depicted the form and nature of the fibrosis, and the images were so characteristic that they could be classified into patterns. In the other cases the depth of tumor invasion could be almost precisely determined by detecting to which layer the changes shown by EUS extended."

By EUS, gastrointestinal aberrant pancreases were delineated as hypoechoic masses with blurred boundary containing fine scattered hyperechoic spots, and also there were thickening of the fourth layer below the mass. Occasionally, there were some duct-like structures within the mass or marginal lobular structures. Moreover, the ultrasonographic patterns of aberrant pancreases were classified into 2 types, that is, M and S types. On histological examination, M type cases, in which the mass attached to the thickened fourth layer by EUS, were corresponded to acinar type and the pancreatic acinar cells penetrated into the proper muscle layer of the gastrointestinal wall, whereas S type cases, in which the mass was separated from the fourth layer, to ductal or mixed type. We conclude, therefore, that not only making the accurate diagnosis of aberrant pancreas but also drawing an inference of its histological type might become possible by EUS."

Namely, we could obtain the accurate diagnosis in 18 out of 20 cases with the rectal or the sigmoid colon cancer. One of causes of misdiagnosis in 2 cases of early cancer was due to the ghost echo. Another cause was the cancer cells infiltration to the deeper tissue which could be recognized only by a microscope.

Histologically, the incidence of necrosis within the tumor was more frequent and the area of necrosis was larger in leiomyosarcoma than in leiomyoma. Liquefaction necrosis was observed only in leiomyosarcoma. By EUS, myogenic tumors originating from the proper muscle were delineated as clearly demarcated hypoechoic tumors arising from the fourth layer. Irregularly shaped sonolucent areas within the tumor corresponded to liquefaction necrosis. Thus, sonolucent areas may be indicative of leiomyosarcoma."

The results were correlated with those obtained with the histology of resected specimens according to the new (1987) TNM classification. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was accurate in assessing the extent and depth of tumor infiltration. Early gastric carcinoma could readily be distinguished from advanced carcinoma. The overall accuracy of EUS was 84.7%. Occasionally, overstaging and understaging occurred. Stenosis was a factor limiting accurate staging. EUS was reasonably accurate in the assessment of lymph node metastasis. The overall accuracy was 81.0%. In non-metastatic lymph nodes, however, the accuracy was only 50%. Difficulties occurred in distinguishing granulomatous lymph nodes and small micrometastatic lymph node involvement. EUS was not accurate in diagnosing distant metastasis, due to the limited depth of penetration of ultrasound. Technical improvements such as a reduction in the diameter of the echoprobe, and the use of the biopsy channel for EUS-guided cytological puncture will further enhance the accuracy of EUS."
CD009944,0,3291775,0,[Endoscopic sonography in cancer diagnosis].,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the method to investigate sonographically tissue architecture by intraluminal scanning using the endoscope mounted a mechanical or electronic scanning device. The method is very effective in visualizing GI tract as well as organs present in the vicinity of digestive hollow organs as high resolution sonographic images. The method can be applied also to investigate various intraperitoneal organs, especially the liver by means of sonolaparoscopy. The most obvious application of the method is the staging of malignant neoplasms of the GI tracts especially of the stomach, esophagus and rectum. EUS mostly reveals five layer structure as layers different in echogenicity and it is considerably accurate to assess extents of wall involvement in malignancy, ulceration and inflammation of the digestive tract. It is effective in differentiating between carcinoma and submucosal tumors simply by ultrasonic localizations of the tumor masses. Involvement of regional lymph-nodes can be assessed is fairly accurate thus giving precise indication in the treatment, either medical or surgical means. Agreements between EUS staging of gastric cancer and histopathological determination were considerably accurate over various stages of gastric cancer, however, the presence of concomitant ulceration sometimes caused slight over-reading on the side of EUS. Laparoscopic sonography has also proven a considerable accuracy over existing imaging methods in terms of differential diagnosis of minute liver masses. These results seem to support the view that EUS, which is only slightly invasive, has opened up new area in cancer diagnosis, especially in the diagnosis of deeply sitting neoplasms, in which other sophisticated imaging technique are not yet available."

In order to achieve absolute curability of early carcinoma, we recommend that polypectomy be performed first, whenever possible. The reason for this is that the resected polypectomised tissue enables a decision to be made as to whether further treatment is necessary, after histopathological examination of the specimen. Otherwise, cases in which snaring is impossible, such as flat or depressed carcinomas of markedly small or large size, should be treated by microwave and/or laser coagulation. In total, we have experienced 92 lesions (83 cases) of early gastric carcinoma treated by all of above 3 methods, and we currently have 5 cases showing more than 5-year survival. Among these, type II a early carcinomas less than 10mm in diameter accounted for the majority; on the other hand, there were 11 type II c cases, also with tumors less than 10mm in diameter. Referring to our surgical data, type II c (without ulcer nor lymph node metastases) less than 5mm in size is limited to the mucosa in 100% of cases, and of 6-10mm in size in 85%. We therefore propose that type II c tumors less than 10mm in size should be treated endoscopically, as well as type II a tumors of the same size. In order to determine the depth of carcinomatous invasion, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is effective. The diagnostic accuracy for Ul(-) early carcinoma is almost 100%, but for Ul(+) cases EUS is not so accurate. Further studies and improvements of EUS are thus needed."
CD009944,0,3278405,0,Impact of endoscopic ultrasonography on diagnosis and treatment of primary gastric lymphoma.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) allows a visualization in vivo of the gastric wall. Five ultrasonic layers of different echogenicities are displayed; each corresponds to a precise anatomic structure. In gastric diseases this layering evidently changes. In 10 patients with suspected primary gastric lymphoma, EUS showed a characteristic thickening of the second, the second and third layers, or a diffuse, transmural thickening of the entire wall. A precise correlation between the longitudinal and depth infiltration observed at EUS and the surgical finding was seen in all patients. In three cases in which the preoperative bioptic diagnosis was erroneous (two gastritis and one carcinoma) EUS showed a characteristic echographic pattern for lymphoma, which was confirmed at surgery. There was agreement also, in EUS and surgical findings in all patients, about involvement of neighbor organs. It seems possible that in the future EUS could play an important role in detecting, staging, and planning treatment of lymphoma and other gastric tumors."

Using EUS the digestive tract wall was seen as a 5-layered structure corresponding to the histological layers. On the basis of this layered structure of the gastric wall, the depth of cancer invasion and the results of laser treatment were evaluated. In 128 cases of gastric cancer examined by EUS and confirmed histologically, when the depth of cancer invasion was classified as mucosal, submucosal, muscularis propria, and deeper-than-subserosal invasion, the accuracy rate was 80%. In 26 cases of early gastric cancer, in the EUS images of the lesions before and after ELT, a lack of the gastric wall caused by the laser irradiation was observed. Furthermore, in the long-term follow-up study using EUS, the residual growth of the extraluminal cancer was detectable. EUS is one of the most promising methods for the evaluation of curative laser treatment of early gastric cancer."
