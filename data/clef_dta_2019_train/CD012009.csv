CD012009,0,6200273,0,Chronic massive pancreatic pleural effusion.,"Chronic massive pancreatic pleural effusion is an uncommon and often unrecognized clinical syndrome which results from an internal pancreatic fistula and usually presents as an exudative effusion of unknown cause. The effusion frequently occurs without clinical evidence of pancreatitis, but occasionally it may be associated with a pseudocyst of the pancreas. Chronic massive pancreatic pleural effusion is usually recurrent and characterized by very high levels of amylase in the pleural fluid. Morbidity and mortality are reduced when a definite diagnosis is established and appropriate therapy rendered. In this report, three cases of chronic massive pancreatic pleural effusions are presented. Two of the three had no demonstrable pancreatic disease, and the condition responded to conservative therapy. The third patient had a pancreatic pseudocyst and an internal pancreatic fistula which was corrected only after multiple surgical procedures."

CD012009,0,8814357,0,Thermostability of purified human pancreatic alpha-amylase is increased by the combination of Ca2+ and human serum albumin.,"Pancreatic fluid from a patient with a post operative pancreatic fistula was used to isolate human alpha-amylase by means of acarbose affinity chromatography. Amylase thermostability was measured in 4 solutions: (1) EDTA-dialyzed; (2) dialyzed solution plus 0.15 mmol/l (1.0 g/dl) human serum albumin; (3) dialyzed solution plus 0.25 mmol/l (1.0 mg/dl) calcium ions; and (4) dialyzed solution with both human serum albumin and calcium ions. Amylase activity was measured at predetermined times in samples heated to 60 degrees C. Thermostability was characterized by t1/2, the time to 50% initial amylase enzyme activity. In the dialyzed solution t1/2 was 0.75 +/- 0.19 min. This rose to 1.62 +/- 0.34 min with added human serum albumin, and to 8.24 +/- 0.13 min with added calcium ions. The combination of human serum albumin and calcium ions resulted in a synergistic increase of t1/2 to 180 +/- 26 min. These findings support our contention that human serum albumin, calcium ions and possibly other body fluid constituents must be considered in any utility involving amylase thermostability as a clinically relevant diagnostic marker."
CD012009,0,8211703,0,Effect of failed computed tomography-guided and endoscopic drainage on pancreatic pseudocyst management.,Computed tomography and endoscopic drainage are used increasingly to treat pancreatic pseudocysts (PP). We reviewed our experience with PP to compare the outcomes of patients operated on initially (group 1) with those whose nonoperative treatment failed (computed tomography-guided or endoscopic drainage) before operation (group 2).
CD012009,0,7093845,0,Pancreatic abscess.,"Pancreatic abscess, although an uncommon complication of pancreatitis, is a serious cause of morbidity and death. During the 5-year period beginning in March 1976, 19 patients with pancreatic abscess were seen at the Ottawa Civic Hospital. Abdominal pain, mass, fever and leukocytosis were common; the serum amylase value was usually normal. twelve patients underwent external drainage; in 6 the abscess was drained internally through the posterior wall of the stomach. The overall mortality was 16%. Morbidity was high; 7 (37%) of the 19 patients required reoperation for recurrent sepsis. Differentiation of pancreatic abscess from phlegmonous pancreatitis or pseudocyst can be difficult. Ultrasonography may be useful but computerized axial tomography is the the diagnostic method of choice. Prompt débridement and external drainage are the mainstays of surgical treatment but internal drainage may be appropriate in selected patients."

CD012009,0,8479170,0,Increased circulating cholecystokinin in obstruction-induced acute pancreatitis. II. Pancreatic duct obstruction with and without bile duct obstruction.,"Pancreatic exocrine stimulation by cholecystokinin (CCK) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental acute pancreatitis. Bile exclusion from the gut stimulates duodenal CCK release and exacerbates obstruction-induced acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic and bile duct obstruction increases circulating CCK concentration. We hypothesized that acute pancreatitis induced by pancreatic and bile duct obstruction would be ameliorated when bile was returned to the duodenum. As many small pancreatic ducts drain into the bile duct in rats, preservation of bile flow required the use of a bile shunt. We studied acute pancreatitis and the time course of circulating CCK increase in three groups of rats after: (1) sham operation (dissection, no obstruction), (2) bile and pancreatic duct obstruction, and (3) bile and pancreatic duct obstruction with bile shunt. The rats were killed at 3-, 6-, and 18-hr intervals after operation. Their blood was collected for measurement of CCK, amylase, and bilirubin concentrations. The pancreata were excised, weighed, and processed for histological examination. The shunting of bile back to the duodenum ameliorated the acute pancreatitis along with a simultaneous limitation of the rise in CCK concentration. This suggests that bile duct obstruction, another form of bile exclusion, exacerbates pancreatic duct obstruction-induced acute pancreatitis. The elevation in CCK concentration showed an early peak indicating that the potential role of CCK in the pathogenesis of obstruction-induced acute pancreatitis is predominantly in the early phase of its development."
CD012009,0,2240868,0,The role of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) in blunt abdominal trauma.,"The diagnosis of pancreatic injury is often difficult because it lies retroperitoneally in a protected area. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of blunt pancreatic trauma can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic Retrograde Pancreatography (ERP) is infrequently used in the diagnosis of pancreatic injury. We reviewed our experience with the use of ERP in patients with blunt pancreatic injury. Two stable patients with traumatic pancreatitis underwent ERP shortly after injury. CT scans revealed a transverse fracture of the distal pancrease in one and fluid accumulation in the other around the pancreas extending to the right kidney and left hepatic lobe. The absence of ductal disruption on ERP allowed nonoperative management of the pancreatitis. Resolution was documented by the absence of symptoms on regular oral intake, normal serum amylase levels, and normal follow-up CT scans. A third patient with persistent fistulae three months postinjury underwent preoperative ERP revealing ductal obstruction. This facilitated the planning of a distal pancreatectomy and subsequently the fistulae healed. A fourth patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy on the basis of clinical and CT scan findings that could have been circumvented with preoperative ERP. ERP in selected patients allows nonoperative treatment in the absence of ductal injury or earlier operative treatment of ductal injury. It also aids the treatment of late complications by delineating ductal anatomy."
CD012009,0,6084386,0,Anticholeretic effects of substance P and somatostatin.,"The aim of the present work was to study the effect of substance P (SP) and somatostatin (SST) on hepatic bile flow. For this purpose a total of 54 anesthetized mongrel dogs were used. The gallbladder was excluded by ligation of the cystic duct and a common duct fistula was created by insertion of a catheter into the common duct. Both SP and SST were found to exert an anticholeretic effect in the dog. SST was also found to be anticholeretic in man. In the dog, SP was infused at dosages from 0.5-20 ng kg-1 min-1 and exerted a significant anticholeretic effect at a dosage of 2.5 ng or higher. At dosages of 2.5 and 20 ng kg-1 min-1, SP decreased the basal bile secretion by about 20 and 40% respectively. The decrease in bile flow was accompanied by decreased outputs of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate and amylase. With taurocholate-stabilized and taurocholate-stabilized and hormone-induced bile secretion, SP had the above mentioned effects and in addition the output of bile acids decreased. The effect of SP occurred within minutes and after withdrawal of SP there was a positive rebound effect, with a magnitude of about 30% following the 20 ng dosage. SST at dosages from 20-1000 ng kg-1 min-1 induced an anticholeretic effect with a magnitude of 10-25%. With both basal and taurocholate-stabilized bile secretion, the outputs of bile, bile acids and electrolytes decreased during the infusion period and remained diminished for 10-20 min after termination of the infusion. Unlike SP, SST had no anticholeretic effect in the presence of CCK or secretin. A simultaneous infusion of SP and SST decreased bile flow more than either agent alone. The anticholeretic effect of SST was verified in five patients. They had all been operated on for choledocholithiasis. In four patients a complete diversion of bile was obtained with a Foley catheter in the common duct and in the fifth patient from an impacted stone in the common duct. During infusion of SST, 250 ug h-1, the outputs of hepatic bile and bile acids decreased while the outputs of cholesterol and phospholipids were unchanged. The serum bile acid concentration was unaffected by SST and therefore SST is suggested to exert an inhibitory effect on bile acid synthesis. The changes in electrolyte outputs induced by SST in man corresponded to those in the dog.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD012009,0,14560986,0,Pancreatic ascites in an infant: lack of symptoms and normal amylase.,"A 4-month-old boy presented with 9 days of abdominal distension. The abdomen was tense, distended, and nontender, with a fluid wave. Hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, high lipase, normal amylase, high ascitic fluid: lipase, amylase, and serum-ascites albumin gradient < 1.1 were present. Abdominal CT showed large ascites, edema, and pancreatic cyst. No improvement was noted with bowel rest, TPN, albumin, furosemide, octreotide, and paracentesis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed disrupted pancreatic duct and a cyst. Pancreatic duct stenting was complicated by early outward migration of the stent and was thus ineffective. An exploratory laporatomy revealed a cyst. Cystogastrostomy resolved the pancreatitis and ascites. The patient was discharged off TPN and tolerating enteral nutrition. Pancreatic ascites is rare, producing few or no symptoms in infants. In conclusion, our patient may have had viral pancreatitis, complicated by a disrupted duct and/or ruptured pseudocyst with ascites formation. Medical management was ineffective. Surgery appears to have been curative."
CD012009,0,26073457,0,Safety and efficacy of early drain removal and triple-drug therapy to prevent pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy.,"Prior studies suggested that early drain removal prevented the development of pancreatic fistula (PF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), but there has been no corresponding prospective trial for distal pancreatectomy (DP). The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of early drain removal and triple-drug therapy (TDT) with gabexate mesilate, octreotide and carbapenem antibiotics to prevent PF after DP in patients at high-risk of developing PF."
CD012009,0,6198528,0,Factors affecting outcome in pancreatic trauma.,"Reported mortality from pancreatic trauma remains at approximately 20% and morbidity is about 33%. A recent series was reviewed to highlight unresolved problems associated with this injury. From 54 consecutive patients treated operatively for pancreatic trauma during a recent 7-year period, 44 patients were evaluated. Among these 44, six died and 12 developed fistulas and/or abscesses. Of those who died, four had colon injuries and two had duodenal injuries, one of whom had combined colon and duodenal injuries. Patients with colon injuries also had a higher incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses and fistulas. Indeed, colon injury currently may be the most significant factor causing morbidity and mortality in cases of pancreatic trauma. Despite improved management of duodenal injuries, morbidity and mortality rates for these patients also remain high. Twenty-six patients went into shock before the end of their operation, and all six deaths occurred in this group. The mean number of intra-abdominal associated organ injuries was 2.1 per patient; complications and deaths were directly related to these injuries."

CD012009,0,6743005,0,Percutaneous drainage of infected pancreatic pseudocysts.,"After diagnostic needle aspiration guided by computed tomography and/or ultrasound, 11 infected pseudocysts in ten patients were treated nonoperatively by percutaneous catheter drainage and intravenously administered antibiotics. Nine infected pseudocysts resolved after 11 to 37 days (mean, 21 days) with no recurrences at follow-up 16 to 42 months (mean, 24.4 months) later. All were confirmed by Gram's stain, culture, and elevated amylase levels. Ten of the pseudocysts were acute; one was chronic; five were polymicrobial; six had a single organism. There were no major complications. There was one failure when a pancreatic abscess developed in a patient who died following operative drainage. There was one successful palliation of a postoperative-infected pseudocyst in a patient with an obstructing nonresectable carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. A trial of percutaneous catheter drainage is indicated in patients with infected pancreatic pseudocysts."

CD012009,0,12522543,0,A giant retention cyst of the pancreas (cystic dilatation of dorsal pancreatic duct) associated with pancreas divisum.,"We describe a rare case of pancreas divisum associated with a giant retention cyst (cystic dilatation of the dorsal pancreatic duct), presumably formed following obstruction of the minor papilla. The patient was treated by pancreatico(cysto)jejunostomy. A 50-year-old man was admitted with complaints of increasing upper abdominal distension and body weight loss. There was no previous history of pancreatitis, gallstones, drinking, or abdominal injury. An elastic-hard tumor-like resistance was palpable in the upper abdomen. Computed tomography and ultrasound (US) examinations revealed a giant cystic lesion expanding from the pancreas head to the tail. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography findings showed a looping pancreatic duct which drained only the head and uncinate process of the pancreas to the main papilla. A US-guided puncture to the cystic lesion revealed that the lesion continued to the main pancreatic duct in the tail of pancreas. The lesion was connected to a small cystic lesion, which was located inside the minor papilla, and ended there. The amylase level in liquid aspirated from the cyst was 37 869 IU/l, and the result of cytological examination of the liquid showed class II. A pancreatico(cysto)jejunostomy was performed, with the diagnosis being pancreas divisum associated with a retention cyst following obstruction of the minor papilla. The histological findings of a specimen from the cyst wall revealed that the wall was a pancreatic duct covered with mildly inflammatory duct epithelium; there was no evidence of neoplasm. The patient is currently well, and a CT examination 2 years after the operation showed disappearance of the cyst and normal appearance of the whole pancreas."

CD012009,0,6203501,0,A comparison of ductal management techniques in an in situ canine pancreas model.,"Twenty-five dogs underwent right pancreatectomy leaving the tall of the pancreas in situ. Five equal groups underwent either intraperitoneal drainage (open-duct group), duct ligation, acrylate glue occlusion, neoprene glue occlusion, or Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy. On day 21 the tall of the pancreas was removed and on day 28 the dogs were killed. Daily serum glucose and amylase and biweekly insulin determinations were performed, and intravenous glucose tolerance tests ( IVGTTs ), with simultaneous insulin assays, were carried out before and after distal pancreatectomy. The mean daily blood glucose level prior to distal pancreatectomy was 95.6 +/- 3.2 mg/dL in the open-duct group, 91.6 +/- 3.0 mg/dL in the ligation group, 94.0 +/- 4.0 mg/dL in the acrylate group, 226.3 +/- 56.6 mg/dL in the neoprene group, and 94.1 +/- 2.6 mg/dL in the Roux-en-Y group. Mean K values (rate constant of glucose clearance) were as follows: open-duct group, -0.907+ +/- 0.240% per minute; ligation group, -1.024% +/- 0.253% per minute; acrylate group, -0.820% +/- 0.087% per minute; neoprene group, -0.526% +/- 0.186% per minute; and Roux-en-Y group, -1.399% +/- 0.566% per minute (normal, -2.201% +/- 0.388% per minute). Insulin release during IVGTT (basal to peak insulin difference) was greatest in the open-duct and Roux-en-Y groups. Although glucose clearance and insulin release were optimal with pancreaticojejunostomy, peripancreatic complications developed in two of the five dogs. In conclusion, the open-duct technique and Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy result in optimal endocrine function in this in situ model. Due to its simplicity, the open-duct technique is most suitable for further laboratory investigations of segmental pancreatic transplantation."
CD012009,0,8542922,0,Effect of octreotide acetate on pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions after pancreatoduodenal resection.,"In view of forecasting the effect of octreotide acetate (Sandostatin) in preventing fistula formation after pancreatic surgery, 9 patients, who had pancreatoduodenectomy 8-12 days before, underwent a 2-day study. The first day, by means of a catheter located in the jejunal loop separately anastomosed to the pancreatic remnant, basal and after secretin stimulation pancreatic secretion was evaluated. During the 2nd day the possible inhibitory effect of octreotide on basal and stimulated secretion was investigated. Under the experimental conditions of the study Sandostatin showed little effect on the water and bicarbonate increase as stimulated by secretin. A greater hormone inhibitory effect on amylase production and pancreatic endocrine function was seen. On the basis of these results the use of Sandostatin can hardly be seen as useful in preventing fistula formation after pancreatic resection."
CD012009,0,12192939,0,[Pleuro-pancreatic fistula diagnosed by ultrasonography].,"A pleural effusion resulting from pancreatitic-pleural fistula is a rare clinical entity which has, however, been more frequently recognised in the last ten years. The cause is a fistula tract between the pancreas and the pleura. Elevated amylase levels in the pleural fluid are the key to suspecting this diagnosis, which needs to be confirmed using imaging techniques such as CT, MRI and ultrasound or ERCP, which are necessary for defining the therapeutic strategy. After the failure of conservative management, a cysto-jejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y loop resolved the pleural effusion. This is the surgical technique of choice in the presence of a pseudocyst. We report details of a patient with a pancreaticopleural fistula diagnosed by ultrasonography, in which CT and ERCP were unable to demonstrate any communication between the pleural cavity and the pseudocyst. Only one similar case has been reported in the literature, diagnosed initially following visualization of a fistula tract at CT. We discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic options."

CD012009,0,1418310,0,Octreotide administration in the treatment of pancreatic fistulae after pancreas transplantation.,"Among the surgical complications of pancreas transplantation are pancreatic fistulae, which arise rather frequently. Suppression of exocrine secretion with polymers has succeeded in reducing the rate of this complication. Nevertheless, in some instances, pancreatic fistulas may occur. Thirty pancreas transplantations were performed in 27 diabetic patients. In 5 cases a pancreatic fistula occurred and was drained after the insertion of a catheter for the collection of secretions. A serous liquid was collected with a high concentration of amylases (61604 +/- 19562 IU/24 h). Fistula output was 280 +/- 87 ml/24 h. Patients were treated with octreotide, administered subcutaneously in a dose of 300-750 micrograms/day. In all patients a progressive reduction in fistula output was observed after a mean of 16 + 2 days. Fistula flow rate dropped to 24 +/- 10 ml/24 h--a reduction of 95% +/- 5% and drainage was subsequently stopped. Sonographic follow-up did not show recurrence of peripancreatic collections in these patients. All patients were insulin-independent up to 12-44 months after surgery."
CD012009,0,3343644,0,Management of pancreatic pseudocysts in children.,"The management of 25 children with pseudocyst of the pancreas presenting over a 30-year period is reviewed. Nearly a third could be managed nonoperatively, monitoring clinical signs, serum amylase, and in recent years the findings of ultrasound and CT scan. Persistence of symptoms, signs, and hyperamylasemia for more than 4 weeks indicated failed resolution in all but one case. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) done in those who did not improve spontaneously facilitated operative strategy. Early operation and internal drainage in selected cases was well tolerated. Individualization of treatment is emphasized."

CD012009,0,2469337,0,Effect of octreotide acetate on pancreatic exocrine function.,"Somatostatin and its analogs have been shown to inhibit both pancreatic endocrine and exocrine function. We hypothesized that octreotide acetate (Sandostatin), a somatostatin analog, decreases the pancreatic flow rate through a peptide-mediated mechanism and alters pancreatic fluid composition by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase action and circulating peptide levels. To test this hypothesis, we collected pancreatic fluid from six patients (four with pancreatic fistulas and two with pancreatic drains after pancreatic resection). Pancreatic fluid volume and chloride, sodium, potassium, amylase, lipase, and bicarbonate levels were measured before and after octreotide acetate therapy. Octreotide acetate reduced pancreatic fluid output by a mean of 75 percent (p less than 0.05), increased chloride concentration by 21 percent (p less than 0.05), and reduced bicarbonate content by 45 percent (p less than 0.05). Sodium levels were unchanged, but the potassium concentration was increased by 14 percent (p less than 0.05). Total amylase and lipase production per 24 hours was decreased by 63 percent and 27 percent, respectively (differences not significant). Somatostatin may be useful in the treatment of established pancreatic fistulas and may be a useful prophylactic tool to prevent postoperative fistula formation."

CD012009,0,11001576,0,Radiofrequency hyperthermia in the palliative treatment of mucinous carcinomatosis of appendiceal origin: optimizing and monitoring heat delivery in western patients.,"Mucinous peritoneal carcinomatosis from a primary gastrointestinal malignancy is a lethal condition that has few treatment options with the use of surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Recent advances in hyperthermia technology and in knowledge of the natural history of this disease has suggested the possible utility of hyperthermia in the application of aggressive local-regional therapy. Radiofrequency (RF) hyperthermia to the whole abdomen, to the hemithorax, or to an isolated mucinous tumour deposit obstructing the gastrointestinal tract was used in patients with disseminated mucinous adenocarcinoma of appendiceal origin. There were 228 hyperthermia treatments in 21 patients, with a median of 10 treatments per patient. The maximum number of treatments was 26, and minimum was one. For the first six hyperthermia treatments, escalating doses of deep hyperthermia (41-45 degrees C) was monitored with multiple sensor internal temperature probes and a single sensor subcutaneous temperature probe. After reaching a maximal hyperthermia treatment, this was maintained for all subsequent treatments. Initially, the maximal temperature allowed in tumour and subcutaneous tissue was 43 degrees C. After 50 hyperthermia treatments, this was changed to 45 degrees C. If disease stabilization or response was insufficient and maximal tolerable hyperthermia had been established, the frequency of treatment was increased from every 4 weeks to every 2 weeks, and escalating doses of mitomycin C at 8 mg/m2 were added to the regimen. Mitomycin C was infused during the hyperthermia treatment. For the first 165 treatments, patients were monitored just before and 10 days after hyperthermia with a complete blood count and a full battery of laboratory tests including amylase and lipase. Response was monitored by carcinoembryonic antigen assays on a monthly basis and CT scans on a 6 monthly basis. None of the 21 patients included in this study died, required intensive care, or required major surgical interventions as a result of hyperthermia treatments. One potentially life-endangering event was profound bradycardia and hypotension observed in a 76-year-old male receiving hyperthermia treatment to his right hemithorax. Two patients developed an enterocutaneous fistula (a frequent spontaneous event in this group of patients) while under treatment. No abnormal laboratory tests were observed in the first 165 hyperthermia treatments. Heat damage to normal tissue was limited to skin blisters in three patients and induration of the subcutaneous tissues in 10 patients. Skin pain on an analogue scale of 0-10 was scored by patients as a mean of 3.6 (range 0-8) before skin analgesia was routinely utilized. With anesthetic gel, the skin discomfort was greatly reduced. Prolonged abdominal pain for 4-20 days following treatment which required narcotic analgesia was seen in four patients. A complication rate of 62% was caused by the long-term indwelling temperature probe sheaths. Infection was observed in four patients, small bowel fistula in one, and dislodgement of the temperature probe sheath requiring repeat CT was necessary in seven patients. After maximal escalation of RF power in seven patients (33%), deep hyperthermia compatible with thermal destruction of tumour (> or = 43 degrees C for 45 min) was recorded in all subsequent treatments. In eight patients (38%), heat generation compatible with chemotherapy augmentation (41.5-43 degrees C) was consistently recorded. In six patients, non-therapeutic temperatures were recorded. There was no correlation of maximal tumour temperature, maximal subcutaneous tissue temperature and maximal RF power. With the use of skin anaesthetic there was no correlation of tumour temperature and the thickness of the subcutaneous layer of the skin. Progression was seen in 14 patients, and 11 of these patients died. No patients who showed disease stabilization have died with a minimum of 2 year follow-up. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"

CD012009,0,6385506,0,[Biliary pancreatitis--diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities with ERCP and endoscopic papillotomy].,"The present retrospective study was undertaken to investigate the value of diagnostic procedures--clinical and biochemical parameters, ultra-sonography and ERCP--and the influence of endoscopic papillotomy on the course of biliary pancreatitis in 22 patients. A further 22 patients with alcoholic pancreatitis served as a control group. In the 22 patients with biliary pancreatitis, the case history pointed to biliary disease in 14 cases; in contrast to the patients with alcoholic pancreatitis, in none of these patients did excessive alcohol consumption precede the disease. Seven out of the 22 patients with biliary pancreatitis, but only 2 out of the 22 cases of alcoholic pancreatitis had a previous cholecystectomy. The pain was localized in the right upper abdomen in 60% of the biliary pancreatitis patients, as compared with only 32% of the patients with alcoholic pancreatitis. The laboratory parameters (serum amylases, SGOT, serum bilirubin and leucocytes) did not permit any differentiation between biliary and alcoholic pancreatitis. With respect to the biliary genesis of pancreatitis, the sensitivity of the ultrasound examination was about 68%. The endoscopic detection of a so-called ""stone papilla"", spontaneous suprapapillary bilio-duodenal fistula, or a blood-tinged papilla, was evidence in favour of a biliary cause of the pancreatitis. In 12 patients, the stones has passed spontaneously; 10 patients were submitted to endoscopic papillotomy for bile duct stones detected by ERCP, and the stones were removed in 9/10 patients. A worsening of the clinical picture by ERCP was not observed in any of the patients. The course of serum amylases, leucocytes and pain in the papillotomied patients corresponded to that in patients with spontaneous stone passage. The results of the present study show that endoscopic papillotomy with stone extraction represents, in most patients with biliary pancreatitis, a possibility for causal therapy, avoiding an emergency surgical intervention. In demonstrated cholecystolithiasis, cholecystectomy can be planned as an elective procedure."
CD012009,0,10101645,0,CT of blunt trauma of the pancreas in adults.,"In order to describe the CT findings in pancreatic injury and to evaluate the sensitivity of this technique, we performed a retrospective study. During a 5-year period (1993-1997), eight patients (five males and three females: age range 10-47 years) were investigated with CT. Endoscopicretrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was obtained in two patients, pre- and intra-operatively, respectively. Among the standard laboratory tests obtained at admission, the value of serum amylase was reviewed. The imaging findings, especially those obtained with CT, were correlated with the surgical findings, when available (in seven of eight patients). At admission, diagnosis of pancreatic injury was missed at CT in three of eight patients (37.5%); thus, the sensitivity of CT for pancreatic injury was 62.5%. ERCP showed rupture of the pancreatic duct in the two cases in which it was performed. Serum amylase was elevated at admission in four of eight patients, resulting in a sensitivity of 50%. After surgery, an enterocutaneous fistula developed in one case, and was managed conservatively. One patient died from brain injury. Proper implementation of the CT technique and accurate film reading is mandatory to establish the diagnosis of pancreatic contusion. No correlation between CT features and type of outcome of surgical management could be established. On retrospective review of the CT examinations, it appeared that two of the three false-negative results could have been avoided. Therefore, proper CT technique and accurate film reading are mandatory in establishing the diagnosis of pancreatic injury."

The goal was to determine if drain data alone was predictive of a leak and validate International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) leak criteria. Participating surgeons entered de-identified data into a web-based database designed to collect Whipple-related data. Definitions used were the ISGPF definition, > or = 3 days, amylase 3x normal; and Sarr's definition, > or = 5 days, amylase 5x normal, > 30 ml. We compared how well these two definitions were at detecting a leak and its complications. There were 1,507 cases submitted from 16 international institutions. A pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) was performed in 76.2%. Drain placement occurred in 98.0%. Using the ISGPF definition, the pancreatic leak rate was 26.7 and 14.3% with the Sarr definition. There were more grades A and B leaks detected by the ISGPF definition. Both determined grade C leaks equally. Both definitions correlated with an increased length of stay (LOS), need for percutaneous drains, reoperation, and delayed gastric emptying (DGE). Neither was associated with an increased risk of intensive care unit (ICU) stay or 30-day mortality. The ISGPF was able to capture more patients with clinically relevant leaks than Sarr's criteria; however, the ability to detect a leak by drain data alone is imperfect."

The study covers 14 transplants, seven carried out without conservation and seven with 24-hour conservation at 4 degrees C. The caudal pancreas was removed after splenectomy and either transfused with 250 ml of 4 degrees C Euro-Collins before immediate transplant or with 250 ml of 4 degrees C conservation fluid for 24 hours before the transplant. The caudal pancreas was transplanted onto the right iliac vessels, while an arterio-venous fistula was created on the distal splenic vessels and the pancreatic duct was injected with modified tissucol. At the same time as the transplant, a cephalic pancreatectomy was performed. Laboratory tests included an intra venous glucose tolerance test monitored on days 0 and 28 and blood glucose and serum amylase measured every three days from days 1 to 28. The histological study of the pancreatic tissues 28 days after the transplants involved the light microscopic evaluation of the degree of fibrosis, inflammation of the pancreas, cystosteatonecrosis and peripancreatic inflammation. We used a computerized method to measure the surface area of the islets of Langerhans, as revealed by immunocytochemistry, and the surface area of fibrosis. The blood glucose and the serum amylase analyses from days 1 to 28, and the blood glucose variations during the intra venous glucose tolerance test, showed no differences between the two groups. Standard laboratory parameters were similar in the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

This randomized prospective study has compared primary closure versus T-tube drainage of the CBD following exploration for calculous disease. Thirty-seven patients underwent primary closure and 26 underwent closure over T-tube. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, indications for surgery, associated illnesses, pre-operative bilirubin, amylase and white cell count. Forty-three per cent of operations were performed by a consultant in the primary closure group and 65% in the T-tube group. There was no significant difference in the duration of operation, incidence of wound infection, surgical or other complications following operation between the two groups. However, the postoperative stay was significantly prolonged in the T-tube group, to a median of 11 days, compared to 8 days in the primary closure group (P = 0.0001). This prolongation in stay was unrelated to whether admission was as an emergency or elective. T-tube drainage of the bile continued for a median of 7 days postoperative, whereas the bile drained via a wound drain in only 13 (35%) of the primary closure group, for a median of 5 days in these 13 patients. Long-term follow up was achieved in 48 patients, by a questionnaire sent at a median of 2.8 years following operation. Abdominal pains following recovery from the operation were experienced by 18% of the primary closure group and 20% of the T-tube group.

Indications for attempting laparoscopic antegrade sphincterotomy included multiple common bile duct stones, one or more common hepatic or intrahepatic stones, a dilated common bile duct requiring a drainage procedure, and suspicion of papillary stenosis. No major complications or mortality was observed. Mild hyperamylasemia was observed in two patients. However, both were asymptomatic, and serum amylase levels rapidly returned to normal. One patient was noted to have a drop in her hematocrit from a preoperative value of 39% to a postoperative value of 33%. Laparoscopic antegrade sphincterotomy added a mean of 17 min to the operative procedure. The mean postoperative stay was 1.4 days.

CD012009,0,19719729,0,Pancreas transplantation alone in children: a case report.,"Pancreas transplantation (PT) is a relatively uncommon therapy for non-uremic type 1 diabetes, as the severity of diabetes must warrant the risk of immunosuppression. In pediatric diabetic patients, who are less likely to display uremia because of the duration of diabetes, there is very little experience with pancreas transplantation alone (PTA). This report describes a 13-yr-old male PTA recipient. This patient was initially diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus at the age of four yr. Following a multidisciplinary evaluation, PTA was found to be indicated based on a history of severe labile diabetes and hypoglycemic unawareness resulting in frequent episodes of hypoglycemia and hospital admissions. Because of the failure of medical management of the patient's diabetes, a whole organ bladder and systemic drained PTA was performed. Immunosuppression included thymoglobulin, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. Early outcome was uneventful and patient was discharged 12 d after surgery normoglycemic and insulin-free. An episode of acute rejection (Maryland grade II) 20-d post-transplant was successfully treated with corticosteroids. A second and more severe episode of rejection (Maryland grade IV) occurred 13 months post-transplant, requiring treatment with thymoglobulin and conversion from steroid to sirolimus. On tacrolimus, sirolimus, and mycophenolic acid, he remains euglycemic and insulin-free 38 months after PTA. His quality-of-life is judged to be superior to his insulin dependent state prior to transplantation. According to the medical literature, this is the youngest patient ever to undergo PTA."

This can also enhance the repair of pancreatic, duodenal and jejunal fistulae. On the basis of experimental studies carried out by Johnson, and on the clinical studies of Guttmann, as well as on original studies done by the authors, Ftorafur was included in the complex therapy of acute pancreatitis, and of pancreatic and duodenal fistulae. A group of 14 cases of acute pancreatitis, were treated. These included 5 necrotic-haemorrhagic pancreatitis, and 9 oedematous pancreatitis. The drug was given by continuous intravenous perfusion in doses of 1,200-1,600 mg per day, for a period of 6-12 days. In all the cases the clinical improvement of the patients as well as recovery of normal values of blood amylase were spectacular, and full recovery was achieved in all the cases. Ftorafur was also used in 3 cases of pancreatic fistulae, and in 2 cases of duodenal fistulae, and recovery was also achieved in a very short time. On the basis of this experience, although small, the authors recommend the introduction of Ftorafur in the complex therapy of acute pancreatitis, as well as in that of pancreatic and duodenal fistulae.

CD012009,0,8520160,0,A new method of performing continuous intraabdominal drainage after pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"Dehiscence of the pancreaticoenterostomy is one of the most feared, yet common, postoperative complications following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). We report herein a new technique we developed for performing continuous intraabdominal suction drainage (CISD) following PD. This method of CISD involves positioning an 18 Fr sump tube beside the pancreaticoenterostomy, with a continuous suction pressure of about -20cmH2O. The fluid obtained from the sump tube is also useful for monitoring amylase levels and providing bacterial cultures to enable the early detection of dehiscence of pancreaticoenterostomy. A study was conducted on 150 patients who underwent PD for periampullary carcinoma over a 20-year period. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not CISD was performed: group 1 comprised 71 patients who had CISD, and group 2 79 patients who did not have CISD. Although the frequency of anastomotic dehiscence did not differ between the two groups (32% in group 1 and 25% in group 2), the mortality rate of the patients with anastomotic leakage in group 1 was lower than that in group 2 (P = 0.07).

In order to explore this possibility, we measured pancreatic fluid, protein and amylase output as a function of aging in the rat. Surgical preparations of the rats included external drainage of pancreatic secretions without obstructing normal bile flow and complete diversion of gastric acid out of the duodenum to prevent endogenous secretin release. Pancreatic secretions were collected in the basal state in unanesthetized animals 24 h after surgery. Protein and amylase output were highest at 3 months of age and decreased to less than 20% of maximal values by 27 months of age. For example, amylase output decreased from 4,354 to 105 U/h/kg and protein output fell from 33.5 to 1.7 mg/h/kg between 3 and 27 months of age. Our findings indicate that aging in the rat is associated with diminished pancreatic exocrine functions. Further careful assessment of pancreatic functions in aging individuals is advisable."

CD012009,0,9367005,0,Difficulties in evaluating urinalysis following combined pancreas-kidney transplantation.,"Combined pancreas-kidney transplantation has been introduced in the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes and renal failure 20 years ago. By 1985 374 combined pancreas-kidney transplantations had been reported to the International Pancreas Transplant Registries. Surgical drainage of the transplanted exocrine pancreas into the urinary bladder solves most of the postoperative problems encountered with the exocrine secretions. Furthermore, monitoring of pancreatic enzyme (amylase) activity in urine has been shown to be useful in diagnosis of rejection of the pancreatic graft. However, little attention has been paid to the biochemical consequences of high activities of proteolytic pancreatic enzymes on the determination of urinary proteins. The present case illustrates the difficulties in interpreting proteinuria in patients with combined pancreas-renal transplant with pancreaticocystostomia. In the propositus, interpretation of the urinary protein electrophoresis is hampered by the presence of pancreatic juice proteins and peptides originating from digestion of proteins by activated pancreatic enzymes. Results of immunochemically determined marker proteins ([micro]albumin, transferrin, beta 2-microglobulin) are unreliable due to digestion by pancreatic enzymes."
CD012009,0,20298720,0,Seroma fluid subsequent to axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer derives from an accumulation of afferent lymph.,"Seroma is a frequent complication of breast cancer surgery, the etiology of which remains indefinite. It represents a subcutaneous accumulation of fluid frequently reported after surgical procedures such as axillary lymph node dissection. Despite previous studies have associated seroma fluid to an inflammatory exudate, the surgical removal of draining lymph nodes may indicate that seroma might not represent a mere exudate but rather an accrual of lymph drained from tributary tissues. To verify this hypothesis, seromas were collected at different intervals of time in patients operated upon for axillary lymph node removal. Fluids were analyzed in details by flow cytometry and biochemical assays for their cellular content and for their molecular features and relevant cytokine content. Lymphocytes and other peculiar blood mononuclear cells were present, while erythrocytes, platelets and granulocytes were absent or extremely rare. The protein concentration resulted lower (median 64%) than in peripheral blood. However, specific proteins related to locoregional tissues resulted highly concentrated (e.g. up to 500% for ferritin and 300% for lactate deydrogenase and exclusive presence of interleukin-6) whereas all enzymes and proteins synthesized in the liver or other organs (e.g. alkaline phosphatase, ALT, gammaGT, prealbumin, transferrin, ceruloplasmin, C3 and C4, alpha2 macroglobulin from liver; apolipoproteins from liver and gut; amylase and lipase from pancreas) were represented in reduced concentrations, thus ruling out that seroma proteins derive directly from blood serum. As a whole, this comprehensive cytological and molecular analysis provided evidences that seroma is constituted by serum ultrafiltrated-derived extracellular fluid of regions located upstream of removed lymph nodes. This fluid is then enriched by proteins and cells collected in the drained regions. Remarkably, seroma fluids collected in the same patient at different time points (up to 50 days following surgery) displayed similar biochemical features, clearly indicating that fluid composition was not significantly affected by post-surgical locoregional flogosis. Finally, the period of seroma formation indicates that lymph accumulates in the axillary region during the interval of time needed for afferent lymphatic vessels to re-anastomose with the efferent ducts. Therefore, seroma fluid represents a font of biological material suitable for investigating the biology of breast cancer, healing tissues and lymph."

From November 1984 to April 1987, a triple therapeutic drug regimen of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone was used for maintenance immunosuppression, and bladder drainage (BD) (n = 39; 38 cadaver (CAD) and 1 related (REL) donor grafts) and enteric drainage (ED) (n = 40; 21 CAD and 19 REL donor grafts) techniques were compared in 59 nonuremic, nonkidney (NUNK) transplant recipients, 21 recipients of previous kidney (PK) transplants and 8 uremic recipients of simultaneous pancreas and kidney (SPK) transplants. The survival rates were higher in recipients of BD CAD and ED REL than of ED CAD grafts (58% and 59% versus 29% at one year for all, and 84%, 84% and 40% for technically successful cases), but patient survival rates were similar (90%, 93% and 90% at one year). BD allows for early diagnosis of rejection based on urine amylase monitoring, and REL grafts are less prone to incite rejection; thus, we are currently performing only BD for grafts from CAD donors, while both techniques are used for REL donor grafts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD012009,0,3415169,0,Pancreatic sphincteroplasty: indications and outcome.,"Twenty patients received transduodenal pancreatic sphincteroplasty for one of three indications: post-cholecystectomy pain with a strongly positive Nardi test (n = 5), recurrent attacks of idiopathic acute pancreatitis (n = 7) and chronic pancreatitis (n = 8). Three patients had an accessory sphincteroplasty in addition to double sphincteroplasty at the major papilla (transampullary septectomy). Pain was relieved in four of the five post-cholecystectomy patients at a median 21 months after sphincteroplasty. On a scale from 0-10 the mean pain score decreased from 9.1 to 2.8, and the preoperative rise in serum amylase with morphine-prostigmine provocation was abolished. None of the patients with recurrent pancreatitis has had a further attack postoperatively, though one had transient pain without hyperamylasaemia. Performed as an adjunct to other pancreatobiliary procedures in five cases, sphincteroplasty has contributed to a satisfactory result in all but two of those with chronic pancreatitis. The only serious complication was an infected pancreatic collection in two patients with concomitant resection or drainage of the distal pancreas."

CD012009,0,12715232,1,Does drainage fluid amylase reflect pancreatic leakage after pancreaticoduodenectomy?,"This study tried to determine if drainage fluid amylase reflects pancreatic leakage after pancreaticoduodenectomy and to determine the factors affecting the drainage amylase level. Patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy were recruited. The drainage amylase was measured from postoperative day (POD) 1 to POD 7. Direct evidence of pancreatic leakage was provided by upper gastrointestinal studies using a water-soluble contrast medium and methylene blue dye in the pancreaticogastrostomy group or by pancreaticography with injected contrast medium via an exteriorized pancreatic stent in the pancreaticojejunostomy group on POD 7. A total of 37 patients were recruited. The drainage amylase level was higher than the normal serum amylase (>or= 190 U/L) in more than half of the cases on the initial POD 2 specimen, with a median of 745 U/L on POD 1 and 663 U/L on POD 2. The drainage amylase level was more than three times the normal serum amylase level (>or= 190 x 3 U/L) in 56.8% on POD 1, in 51.4% on POD 2, and in nearly one-third on POD 7 (29.7%). However, no pancreatic leakage occurred in any of the patients with a drainage amylase of >or= 190 U/L. Only one case of pancreatic leakage with a small amount of drainage fluid (10 ml) and low amylase level (74 U/L), was noted. Soft pancreatic parenchyma and a nondilated pancreatic duct were significantly associated with higher drainage amylase levels. In conclusion, biochemical leakage defined by amylase-rich drainage fluid might have no clinical significance and was not necessarily clinical pancreatic leakage following pancreaticoduodenectomy."

CD012009,0,1466620,0,Conversion of exocrine secretions from bladder to enteric drainage in recipients of whole pancreaticoduodenal transplants.,"Between September 1984 and August 1991, 265 whole pancreaticoduodenal transplants were done at our institution, with bladder drainage of exocrine secretions through a duodenocystostomy. Seventeen patients subsequently underwent conversion from bladder to enteric drainage at 2 to 64 months after transplant. Eight conversion procedures were done to correct chronic intractable metabolic acidosis due to bicarbonate loss from the allograft: seven to alleviate severe dysuria, presumed secondary to the action of graft enzymes on uroepithelium; one to prevent recurrent allograft pancreatitis, presumed secondary to back pressure from the bladder; and one because of graft duodenectomy for severe cytomegalovirus duodenitis with perforation. None were done to correct technical complications from the initial transplant operation. The conversions were done by dividing the graft duodenocystostomy, then re-establishing drainage through a graft duodenal-recipient jejunal anastomosis. A simple loop of recipient jejunum was used for the duodenojejunostomy in 15 cases, and a Roux limb in two. One of those two cases had a previously created Roux limb that was available for use. The other was in the patient who underwent graft duodenectomy and subsequent mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis of the pancreatic duct to a newly created Roux limb of jejunum. All patients experienced relief of their symptoms after operation. Two patients had surgical complications (12%), an enterotomy in one case, which was closed operatively, and an enterocutaneous fistula in the other case, which healed spontaneously with bowel rest and parenteral nutrition. The drawback to conversion is loss of urine amylase as a marker for rejection, particularly in recipients of solitary pancreas grafts (n = 5). In recipients of simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) allografts (n = 12), the kidney can still be used to monitor for rejection (two with follow-up < 1 year, 10 with follow-up > 1 year). None of our solitary pancreas recipients, however, have lost graft function (follow-up, 10 to 36 months). The only pancreas allograft loss was in an SPK recipient who also rejected the kidney 6 months after conversion. She received a second SPK transplant with enteric drainage, and is insulin independent and normoglycemic 10 months after retransplantation. Patients converted for metabolic acidosis tended to have impaired renal function (mean creatinine, 2.14 +/- 0.98 mg/dL at time of conversion) due to chronic rejection, progression of native kidney diabetic nephropathy, or cyclosporine toxicity, and possibly could not compensate for bicarbonate loss from the pancreas allograft.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD012009,0,2680330,0,[A surgical etiology of respiratory distress in necrotizing pancreatitis: pancreato-bronchial fistula. 3 cases].,"Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a frequent feature in acute pancreatitis, but précise etiology of hypoxemia remains unclear. Determinations of lipase and amylase levels are made in samples of bronchial secretion, in three intubated patients receiving assisted ventilation for severe hypoxemia occurring in the course of pancreatitis. This determination appeared to be valuable to incriminate the responsibility of a pancratico-bronchial fistula. In the first case, emergency laparotomy was able to show the fistulous track. In the second described case, an endoscopic retrograde pancreatography was performed, showing a fistula from pancreatic body to left bronchial tree. In the third case, the presence of a bronchial fistula was proved by a fistulography trough the abdominal pancreatic necrosis. A decrease of arterial PO2 followed pancreatography and fistulography. The surgical treatment was splenopancreatectomy, necrosectomy associated with left pulmonary lobectomy, and necrosectomy with colonic diversion. In the third case, pancreatico-bronchial fistula was the final evolution of an infected intra-abdominal necrosis, despite multiple surgical drainages. In the first and second cases, surgical treatment obtained a prompt and uneventful recovery. Few published cases of pancreatico-bronchial fistulae are reported. A retrospective study of 12 ARDS was made among 40 patients underwenting laparotomy, with an objective recognition of necrotizing pancreatitis, from 1980 to 1987. A pancreatico-bronchial fistula could be incriminated in three cases of these 12 ARDS. Such a prevalence of 25% has to be reevaluated after serial determinations of lipase and amylase levels in bronchial samples of intubated patients suffering from ARDS in the course of pancreatic disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD012009,0,20845520,0,Delayed internal pancreatic fistula with pancreatic pleural effusion postsplenectomy.,"The occurrence of pancreatic pleural effusion, secondary to an internal pancreatic fistula, is a rare clinical syndrome and diagnosis is often missed. The key to the diagnosis is a dramatically elevated pleural fluid amylase. This pancreatic pleural effusion is also called a pancreatic pleural fistula. It is characterized by profuse pleural fluid and has a tendency to recur. Here we report a case of delayed internal pancreatic fistula with pancreatic pleural effusion emerging after splenectomy. From the treatment of this case, we conclude that the symptoms and signs of a subphrenic effusion are often obscure; abdominal computed tomography may be required to look for occult, intra-abdominal infection; and active conservative treatment should be carried out in the early period of this complication to reduce the need for endoscopy or surgery."
CD012009,0,7759966,0,Management of pancreatic injuries.,"Pancreatic injuries from penetrating trauma are usually diagnosed early owing to the obvious indications for early abdominal exploration. Isolated injuries to the pancreas from blunt abdominal trauma are frequently diagnosed late since a period of time is required for the development of clinical signs of peritonitis or pancreatitis. A significant elevation of serum amylase level was found in all cases of delayed operation in this study. Distal pancreatectomy concomitant with splenectomy was the most frequent operation performed for injuries to the body and tail of the pancreas. Splenic preserving distal pancreatectomy was also performed in 3 cases. Adequate external drainage was required in all forms of pancreatic injuries. Although, the morbidity rate was 41 per cent, almost all recovered after a period of conservative treatment. Two patients died from intraabdominal sepsis and multi-system organ failure. The mortality in pancreatic trauma was related to associated injuries rather than to pancreatic injury alone."
CD012009,0,2673082,0,A 10-year experience with 290 pancreas transplants at a single institution.,"Since our report at the 1984 American Surgical Association meeting of 100 pancreas transplants from 1966 through 1983, another 190 have been performed. The current series, begun in 1978, now numbers 276 cases, and includes 133 nonuremic recipients of pancreas transplants alone (PTA), 46 simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplants (SPK), and 97 pancreas tranplants after a kidney transplant (PAK). Duct management techniques used were free intraperitoneal drainage in 44 cases, duct occlusion in 44, enteric drainage in 89, and bladder drainage in 128. The 1-year patient and graft survival rates in the entire cohort of 276 were 91% and 42%. One-year patient survival rates were 88% in the first 100, 91% in the second 100, and 92% in the last 76 cases; corresponding 1-year graft survival rates were 28%, 47%, and 56% (p less than 0.05). A prospective comparison of bladder drainage (n = 82) versus enteric drainage (n = 46) in PAK/PTA cases since November 1, 1984 favored bladder drainage (1-year graft survival rates of 52% vs. 41%) because of urinary amylase monitoring. The best results were in recipients of primary SPK bladder-drained transplants (n = 39), with a 1-year pancreas graft survival rate of 75%, kidney graft survival rate of 80%, and patient survival rate of 95%. Logistic regression analysis, with 1-year graft function as the independent variable, showed significant (p less than 0.05) predictors of success (odds ratio) to be technique: bladder drainage (5.8) versus enteric drainage (2.5) versus duct injection (1.0); category: SPK (6.0) versus PAK from same donor (3.2) versus PAK from different donor (1.2) versus PTA (1.0); and donor HLA DR mismatch: 0 (5.0) versus 1 (2.5) versus 2 (1.0) antigens. On April 1, 1989, 90 patients had functioning grafts (60 euglycemic and insulin-free for more than 1 year, 10 for 5 to 10 years); these, along with 24 others whose grafts functioned for 1 to 6 years before failing, are part of an expanding cohort in whom the influence of inducing a euglycemic state on pre-existing secondary complications of diabetes is being studied. Only preliminary data is available. In regard to neuropathy, at more than 1 year after transplant in patients with functioning grafts, conduction velocities in some nerves were increased over baseline. In regard to retinopathy, deterioration in grade occurred in approximately 30% of the recipients by 3 years, whether the graft functioned continuously or failed early, but thereafter retinopathy in the patients with functioning grafts remained stable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD012009,0,2470402,0,Pleural effusions and pancreatico-pleural fistulae associated with asymptomatic pancreatic disease.,Four patients are described in whom recurrent large pleural effusions developed secondary to asymptomatic pancreatic disease. The diagnosis was made by measuring the amylase content of the pleural fluid. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and computed tomography (CT) were useful in demonstrating pancreatico-pleural fistulae. Two patients underwent laparotomy and distal pancreatectomy. One recovered spontaneously after ERCP appeared to relieve an obstruction of the pancreatic duct and the other recovered after a period of parenteral nutrition. We suggest that pleural fluid amylase content should be measured in any case of exudative pleural effusion of unknown aetiology.

CD012009,0,24650171,0,Management of pancreatic ductal leaks and fistulae.,"Pancreatic duct leaks can occur as a result of both acute and chronic pancreatitis or in the setting of pancreatic trauma. Manifestations of leaks include pseudocysts, pancreatic ascites, high amylase pleural effusions, disconnected duct syndrome, and internal and external pancreatic fistulas. Patient presentations are highly variable and range from asymptomatic pancreatic cysts to patients with severe abdominal pain and sepsis from infected fluid collections. The diagnosis can often be made by high-quality cross-sectional imaging or during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Because of their complexity, pancreatic leak patients are best managed by a multidisciplinary team comprised of therapeutic endoscopists, interventional radiologists, and surgeons in the field of pancreatic interventions. Minor leaks will often resolve with conservative management while severe leaks will frequently require interventions. Endoscopic treatments for pancreatic duct leaks have replaced surgical interventions in many situations. Interventional radiologists also have the ability to offer therapeutic interventions for many leak patients. The mainstay of endotherapy for pancreatic leaks is transpapillary pancreatic duct stenting with a stent that bridges the leak if possible, but varies based on the manifestation and clinical presentation. Fluid collections that result from leaks, such as pseudocysts, can often be treated by endoscopic transluminal drainage with or without endoscopic ultrasound or by percutaneous drainage. Endoscopic interventions have been shown to be effective and have an acceptable complication rate."
CD012009,0,2471970,0,Recurrent pancreatitis secondary to hypercalcemia following vitamin D poisoning.,"A 66-year-old patient had been admitted four times for recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. At each time, elevated serum calcium levels, between 13.5-14.5 mg/dl, were found. Surgical drainage of necrotic pancreatic tissue had to be done on one occasion. Extensive investigations failed to disclose any conventional hypercalcemic disease. At his latest admission, the serum calcium level was 13.4 mg/dl, and the serum amylase level was 440 IU/L (N, less than 85). This time, the serum 25-OH vitamin D levels were investigated using radioimmunology and proved to be raised to 330 micrograms/L (normal, 16-74 micrograms/L). Specific questioning of the patient revealed that he had been taking regularly excessive quantities of vitamin supplements as a self medication. After stopping vitamin intake, his serum amylase levels returned to normal, and he had no more episodes of pancreatitis. This case illustrates vitamin D intoxication as a cause of recurrent pancreatitis. Measuring serum 25-OH vitamin D levels is advocated in pancreatitis associated with hypercalcemia of unclear origin."

CD012009,0,7510016,0,[Studies on leakage of pancreatic juice following distal pancreatectomy from the standpoint of transition of amylase and trypsin values in exudate].,"Selective drainage method of remnant pancreatic stump (RPS) using latex rubber was devised, and I have obtained a good clinical result for the prevention of postoperative bleeding due to the leakage of pancreatic juice after distal pancreatectomy. In this study, amylase (Am:IU/L) and trypsin (Tr:ng/ml) values in exudate were measured to clarify the actual leakage of pancreatic juice. Thirty-three patients with gastric cancer who underwent total gastrectomy with distal pancreatectomy were chosen for this study; 21 cases of selective drainage (group A) and 12 cases of non-selective drainage (group B). The results are noted below. 1) Both Am and Tr values of group A in the exudate from remnant pancreatic stump were statistically higher than those of group B (p < 0.01). Mean values of group A and group B on the first post-operative day were 25.6 x 10(4) versus 2.6 x 10(4)IU/L (Am value) and 324.4 x 10(4) versus 12.2 x 10(4)ng/ml (Tr value), respectively. 2) The mean values rapidly decreased and bottomed on the sixth postoperative day. 3) Not only total drainage amount of Am (sigma Am: sum of Am value x exudate volume from each drain) but also sigma Tr in group B were markedly less than in group A (p < 0.01). It means that more than 40% of pancreatic juice remained in the abdomen without drainage in group B. In conclusion, effective and active drainage of remnant pancreatic stump for the initial three days at least is important to prevent complications and our selective drainage is one of the excellent methods."

Acute pseudocysts occur in acute pancreatitis but can be found after an acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatic pseudocysts are typically found in chronic pancreatitis but may develop after an occurrence of acute pancreatitis as well. Most acute fluid collections and pseudocysts will show spontaneous resolution while the remaining may persist with or without symptoms, or progress to produce complications. Treatment is indicated for persistent, symptomatic pseudocysts and, in the case of complications. There is no clear consensus regarding the optimal clinical or radiologic follow-up after treatment. Detection of late recurrence is not common, and the possibility of a cystic neoplasm must be ruled out."

Penetrating injuries were always suspected and treated by time: following blunt injury diagnostic delay was encountered in 14 patients and insufficient surgical procedure because of intra-operative misinterpretation in 2 patients. Most of the patients had associated intra-abdominal organ injuries. Adjusts to diagnosis such as abdominal roentgenograms, serum amylase levels and gastroduodenography was not helpful. CT scan and ultrasound allowed to confirm the suspected diagnosis in 3 cases only. Intraoperative diagnosis was also challenging. Complete mobilization of the strictures surrounding the duodenum and the pancreas to provide entire exposure was necessary in 12 patients treated first in a peripheral hospital, diagnosis of the injury have been missed at first laparotomy and reoperation was necessary in all of them. Suture closure of the duodenum and drainage of the pancreatic region wee the most common reparative techniques used.

The patients have been divided into two groups: Group I (30 patients) with no complications at the pancreatico-jejunostomy--Group II (9 patients) with a pancreatic leak. The analysis of the volume, amylase concentration and amylase index (Log of the amylase concentration x volume) showed that the groups had clearly different profiles: in group I all three criteria were rapidly decreasing, while they remained abnormally high in group II. Those criteria may help the clinician in the monitoring of individual patients; they also may prove useful in prospective studies evaluating new means of prevention of this anastomosis."

CD012009,0,6121911,0,Exocrine pancreatic function following proximal small bowel resection in rats.,"1. In order to assess if proximal enterectomy induces changes in the function of the exocrine pancreas, the exocrine pancreas was studied 1 week, 4 weeks, and 6 months after 50 or 75% proximal small bowel resection. 2. One week after 50 and 75% proximal small bowel resections, basal pancreatic bicarbonate outputs, studied by means of an external pancreatic fistula in conscious rats, were increased significantly over control values by 43 and 78% respectively. Four weeks after a 75% resection, the bicarbonate output was still significantly higher in resected animals than in sham operated animals. 3. The increase of volume and bicarbonate of the basal pancreatic secretion coincided with a 4-fold increase in plasma secretin concentration 1 week after resection. Both increased pancreatic secretion and plasma secretin concentration were transient. 4. The pancreatic hypersecretion was specifically reversed to control values with an I.P. injection of jejunoileal mucosa homogenate. 5. Serum gastrin and somatostatin values in intestinal mucosa and pancreas were not changed 1 and 4 weeks after enterectomy compared with sham operated animals. 6. The weight of the pancreas and its content of DNA were unaltered by resection. Amylase and chymotrypsinogen per gram pancreatic tissue and per microgram DNA were reduced 4 weeks following resections as compared with sham operated rats. After 6 months, chymotrypsinogen appeared further reduced in resected animals. 7. It is concluded that extensive proximal enterectomy in rats produced early, transient and marked increases in basal pancreatic water and bicarbonate secretion and in plasma secretin due to the loss of jejunoileal inhibitor(s), and a selective decrease in certain enzymes in pancreatic tissue."
CD012009,0,2218873,0,Are cystgastrostomy and cystjejunostomy equivalent operations for pancreatic pseudocysts?,"To compare the effectiveness of cystgastrostomy and cystjejunostomy for treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts, 39 patients with cystgastrostomy were compared to 59 patients with cystjejunostomy. The groups were comparable in age, sex, cause of pancreatitis, pseudocyst location, symptoms, and preoperative serum amylase level. Cysts treated with cystgastrostomy were larger (mean diameter, 11.1 +/- 0.9 cm) than cysts treated by cystjejunostomy (mean diameter, 6.7 +/- 0.7 cm) (p less than 0.05). Mean duration of surgery was 148 +/- 11 minutes for cystgastrostomy versus 265 +/- 15 minutes for cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05). Mean blood loss was 397 +/- 82 ml for cystgastrostomy versus 703 +/- 80 ml for cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05) Mean intraoperative fluid requirements were 2640 +/- 313 ml for cystgastrostomy and 4403 +/- 362 ml for cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05). Cyst recurrence was 10% for cystgastrostomy versus 7% for cystgastrostomy. Postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 8% of patients with cystgastrostomy and in 2% of patients with cystjejunostomy. Infection problems with cystjejunostomy included two wound infections and one case of septicemia; infection problems with cystjejunostomy included five intraabdominal abscesses, two wound infections, and one case of pneumonia. Two patients died with cystgastrostomy (both from gastrointestinal bleeding); two patients died with cystjejunostomy (one from intraabdominal sepsis and one from pulmonary embolus). Cystgastrostomy was used for significantly larger pseudocysts and was associated with significantly less blood loss and operating time than cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05). Morbidity and mortality from cystgastrostomy and cystjejunostomy were comparable, although gastrointestinal bleeding was more common with cystgastrostomy and intraabdominal abscess was more common with cystjejunostomy. Since cystgastrostomy can usually be performed more quickly and with less blood loss, it should be considered whenever anatomically feasible."
CD012009,0,22563182,0,Acute chylous peritonitis due to acute pancreatitis.,"We report a case of acute chylous ascites formation presenting as peritonitis (acute chylous peritonitis) in a patient suffering from acute pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia and alcohol abuse. The development of chylous ascites is usually a chronic process mostly involving malignancy, trauma or surgery, and symptoms arise as a result of progressive abdominal distention. However, when accumulation of ""chyle"" occurs rapidly, the patient may present with signs of peritonitis. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult since the clinical picture usually suggests hollow organ perforation, appendicitis or visceral ischemia. Less than 100 cases of acute chylous peritonitis have been reported. Pancreatitis is a rare cause of chyloperitoneum and in almost all of the cases chylous ascites is discovered some days (or even weeks) after the onset of symptoms of pancreatitis. This is the second case in the literature where the patient presented with acute chylous peritonitis due to acute pancreatitis, and the presence of chyle within the abdominal cavity was discovered simultaneously with the establishment of the diagnosis of pancreatitis. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy for suspected perforated duodenal ulcer, since, due to hypertriglyceridemia, serum amylase values appeared within the normal range. Moreover, abdominal computed tomography imaging was not diagnostic for pancreatitis. Following abdominal lavage and drainage, the patient was successfully treated with total parenteral nutrition and octreotide."

Nine patients received whole organ pancreaticoduodenal allografts with exocrine drainage to the bladder. Eight of the patients received simultaneously a renal allograft. The serum concentration of immunoreactive cationic elastase increased gradually during the first postoperative days to a peak on the fifth day after surgery; all other proteins decreased in concentration after the first day. Eighteen episodes of pancreatic and/or kidney rejection, diagnosed by means of kidney biopsy, urinary cytology, kidney function, and urinary amylase levels, were analyzed. The pancreatic proteins displayed different patterns in serum concentration during the days immediately before diagnosis of rejection. The pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor showed the most pronounced peak in serum concentration during rejection and even reacted during some episodes without a decline in urinary amylase output. Cationic elastase on the other hand showed no reaction at all. From this homogeneous material it is possible to conclude that changes in serum concentrations during rejection are not the same for all pancreatic exocrine proteins."

The main advantage of this operation compared with major resections is that it permits to spare normal pancreatic parenchyma; moreover, spleen and upper digestive and biliary tracts are saved. The description of the complete operation was reported for the first time by Dagradi and Serio in 1984 and subsequently spread worldwide by Iacono and Serio. In our opinion, it should be called the Dagradi-Serio-Iacono operation, by the names of the surgeons who first performed it (Dagradi and Serio), and by the names of the surgeons responsible for reporting it worldwide with precise indications (Iacono and Serio). Operation requires a midline or a bilateral subcostal incision; the lesser sac is entered through dissection of the transverse colon from the omentum or by transecting the gastrocolic ligament. The pancreatic segment harboring the lesion is then mobilized and its posterior surface carefully dissected from the splenic vein and artery. Subsequently, the pancreatic portion harboring the tumor is isolated at its superior margin from the splenic artery after the pancreas is transacted. The extent of the resection of the central segment is limited on the right by the gastroduodenal artery and on the left by the need to leave at least 5 cm of normal pancreatic remnant. The resected pancreatic specimen is sent to the pathologist for confirmation of diagnosis and to check if the resection margins are adequate. Hemostasis of the two raw surfaces is achieved with interrupted 5 or 4/0 nonabsorbable stitches. When it is not stapled, the Wirsung's duct of the cephalic stump is sutured selectively with a figure-of-eight nonabsorbable stitch. An end-to-end invaginated pancreaticojejunostomy is carried out with a single layer of interrupted stitches. The operation is concluded with the construction of an end-to-side jejuno-jejunostomy about 50 cm distal to the pancreatic anastomosis. Other techniques for reconstruction of the distal stump using jejunum or stomach have been described. One or two soft drains are brought out on the right side. The fluid collected from this drain is checked for amylase level on postoperative days 3, 5, and 7; if the level is low or absent, the drain is removed. Central pancreatectomy is a safe technique for benign or low malignant tumors of the pancreatic neck that allows curing the tumor with evident functional results without increasing the risk for the patient. We can say that CP has a clear role like pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy and we think that a pancreatic surgeon has to include this procedure in his/her technical skills. In order to obtain excellent results, correct indications and experience in pancreatic surgery are recommended."
CD012009,0,9569357,0,Selective role for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in abdominal trauma.,"Emergency endsocopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is rarely indicated in trauma patients; however, in cases of suspected pancreatic or bile duct injury or bile leak, it may be useful. The purpose of this paper is to review our ERCP experience in trauma patients. Our Level I Trauma Center admits 1800 patients annually."
CD012009,0,1715990,0,Bile exclusion from the gut exacerbates acute pancreatitis caused by pancreatic duct obstruction in rats.,"Acute pancreatic duct obstruction causes hyperamylasemia and mild pancreatic inflammation. We hypothesized that bile exclusion from the gut, which stimulates pancreatic secretion, exacerbates acute pancreatitis caused by pancreatic duct obstruction. Rats were surgically prepared with gastric, duodenal, bile, and pancreatic fistula catheters and a jugular vein catheter. After a 4-day recovery, groups of rats (a) served as controls, (b) had complete pancreatic duct obstruction for 6 h, or (c) had bile excluded from the gut for 24 h and then, during the final 6 h, complete pancreatic duct obstruction. Plasma amylase was measured, and all rats were euthanized at the end of experiments. Each pancreas was excised and weighed, and portions were fixed in formalin and glutaraldehyde. In blind fashion, each pancreas was examined under light microscopy and assigned a pancreatitis score based on presence of edema and severity of acinar cell changes and inflammation. Acute pancreatic duct obstruction was associated with increased pancreas weight, hyperamylasemia, and elevated pancreatitis score; moderate acinar cell vacuoles, which were observed in the cytoplasm near the basolateral membrane, and loss of microvilli were noted with electron microscopy. Bile exclusion from the gut exacerbated the acute pancreatitis caused by pancreatic duct obstruction; acinar cell distortion and destruction, as well as marked inflammation, were seen microscopically. These observations suggest that the absence of intestinal bile contributes to the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis associated with pancreatic duct obstruction."
CD012009,0,10951797,0,Cystadenomas of the pancreas.,"Cystadenomas of the pancreas are rare tumors. They represent about 10% of the pancreatic cystic masses. Several hundred cases seem to have been reported so far. These tumors appear as serous and mucinous. Over 13 years period (1983-1996) we treated 22 patients for cystadenoma of the pancreas. All patients were women. There were 6 serous and 16 mucinous cystadenomas. The average age in the serous group was 31 years (ranging from 23 to 42 years) and 43 years (ranging 17-64) in mucinous group. Two patients had tumor in the head, 20 others in the tail and body of the pancreas. The diameter of these tumors varied from 3.5 to 17.0 cm (average 9.6 cm). The leading symptoms were epigastric or left subcostal pain in 19 patients, palpable mass in 10, weight loss in 5, vomiting in 5, and melena in one patient. Tumor was accidentally found in a women undergoing abdominal operation for enteric fistula after hysterectomy. Serum amylase was moderately elevated in two patients. Diagnosis of pancreatic cystadenoma was proposed preoperatively in 16 patients (72.7%). In other cases, diagnoses of pancreatic cysts in 5 patients or hydatid cyst in 1 patient were made. An ideal operative removal (excision) was done in 7 patients, both excision of the tumor and splenectomy in 2, while distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were carried out in 13 others. There was no mortality. One female patient developed left subphrenic abscess and left pleural effusion which were successfully treated by drainage and thoracocenthesis. One patient developed transient pancreatic fistula. All patients have been under close follow-up from 6 months to 13 years and all stayed symptom free so far."
CD012009,0,2500016,0,Pancreas transplants: evaluation using perfusion scintigraphy.,"To determine the value of scintigraphic perfusion studies in evaluating pancreas transplant patients, we reviewed 56 of these studies in 22 patients who had 27 transplants. Seventeen patients underwent two or more studies. The perfusion studies were performed with 20 mCi (740 MBq) of 99mTc-DTPA injected as a bolus followed by eight to 16 serial 2-sec images and a 500,000-count immediate static image. Images were evaluated for (1) the time and intensity of pancreatic peak radioactivity relative to the time and intensity of the iliac arterial peak; (2) relative pancreatic to iliac arterial intensity on the static image; and (3) size, homogeneity, and definition of the pancreas. Clinical diagnoses at the time of scintigraphy of normal function (n = 36), rejection (n = 13), pancreatitis (n = 6), or arterial thrombosis (n = 1) were based on insulin requirement, urine amylase, serum glucose, serum amylase, response to therapy, cultures, CT, MR, sonography, scintigraphy with 67Ga or 111In-WBCs, percutaneous drainage results, angiography, surgery, and pathologic examination of resected transplants. Three 99mTc-DTPA perfusion studies showed no pancreatic perfusion, four showed decreasing perfusion on serial studies, and five showed progressive loss of definition of the pancreas on serial studies. Of the three patients with no detectable perfusion, one had a normally functioning transplant, one had arterial thrombosis with transplant infarction, and one had severe rejection with minimal function. Decreasing perfusion was associated with rejection in three patients and pancreatitis in one. Decreasing definition was seen in four patients with rejection and one with pancreatitis. We conclude that perfusion scintigraphy is useful, primarily when performed serially, although nonspecific for evaluating pancreas transplants."
CD012009,0,3612458,0,Surgical management of pancreatitis in childhood.,"In a retrospective study of patients 18 years of age and younger over a 28-year period, 48 children had pancreatitis. Epigastric pain, nausea, and emesis were present in 90%. Hyperamylasemia was present in 34 children; elevated amylase/creatinine clearance ratio was helpful in diagnosing ten others. In four children, pancreatitis was diagnosed at laparotomy. Etiology of the pancreatitis was idiopathic in 16, drug-induced in 12, all of whom had received corticosteroids. Nine developed pancreatitis after blunt trauma; seven had obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary drainage system. Two children developed pancreatitis in association with sepsis, and two had recurrent hereditary pancreatitis. Thirty of the 48 patients were managed nonoperatively while operations were required in 18. Seven had drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, four had a pancreatectomy, and four underwent laparotomy with debridement and drainage of necrotic pancreas. Bilioenteric bypass procedures were performed to prevent recurrent pancreatitis in three patients; while duodenojenjunostomy sphincteroplasty and cholecystectomy were performed in one child each. Cure was achieved in 38 of 48 children treated for pancreatitis and its complications; each subsequently grew and developed normally. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis occurred in seven children, six of whom died. Seven deaths occurred, all in the medically treated group. Fifteen of the 18 children treated operatively did well in long-term follow-up. Although rare, pancreatitis is a serious cause of abdominal pain in childhood; almost half of the children will benefit from operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD012009,0,25621676,0,The gastric/pancreatic amylase ratio predicts postoperative pancreatic fistula with high sensitivity and specificity.,"This article aims to identify risk factors for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) and evaluate the gastric/pancreatic amylase ratio (GPAR) on postoperative day (POD) 3 as a POPF predictor in patients who undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD).POPF significantly contributes to mortality and morbidity in patients who undergo PD. Previously identified predictors for POPF often have low predictive accuracy. Therefore, accurate POPF predictors are needed.In this prospective cohort study, we measured the clinical and biochemical factors of 61 patients who underwent PD and diagnosed POPF according to the definition of the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula. We analyzed the association between POPF and various factors, identified POPF risk factors, and evaluated the predictive power of the GPAR on POD3 and the levels of serum and ascites amylase.Of the 61 patients, 21 developed POPF. The color of the pancreatic drain fluid, POD1 serum, POD1 median output of pancreatic drain fluid volume, and GPAR were significantly associated with POPF. The color of the pancreatic drain fluid and high GPAR were independent risk factors. Although serum and ascites amylase did not predict POPF accurately, the cutoff value was 1.24, and GPAR predicted POPF with high sensitivity and specificity.This is the first report demonstrating that high GPAR on POD3 is a risk factor for POPF and showing that GPAR is a more accurate predictor of POPF than the previously reported amylase markers."
CD012009,0,2412525,0,Evaluation of techniques of controlling exocrine drainage after segmental pancreatectomy in dogs. Implications for pancreatic transplantation.,"Pancreatic transplantation is hampered by difficulties in controlling exocrine drainage. Methods of controlling exocrine drainage were assessed in 30 dogs receiving right lobe pancreatectomy. In the sham group, laparotomy and dissection of the pancreas were performed. In the others, the duct was either left open, ligated, anastomosed to jejunal mucosa, or injected with 1.5 mL of either silicone rubber, Neoprene, or Prolamine. Serial serum glucose and amylase levels were obtained at regular intervals and pancreatic biopsies were performed at two and eight weeks for examination. Glucose homeostasis was maintained throughout the study period. All animals developed severe pancreatitis as shown by hyperamylasemia by the second postoperative day, which resolved in most animals by the tenth to 14th day. Animals were free of ascites, pancreatic abscesses, and pseudocysts. All methods of ductal obstruction as well as the open duct drainage led to islet and acinar fragmentation and fibrosis. Endocrine function was preserved in all groups. In three animals with patent ductal-jejunal anastomoses, the pancreas appeared normal. Duct-to-jejunum anastomosis was the preferred method to preserve pancreatic function and morphology."
CD012009,0,2412526,0,An in situ evaluation of distal splenic arteriovenous fistula on pancreas function in an isolated pancreas segment.,"To determine the effects of a distal splenic arteriovenous fistula on endocrine function and pancreatic blood flow, 25 dogs underwent proximal pancreatectomy with the pancreatic tail left in situ and free intraperitoneal drainage of the pancreatic duct. Group A served as controls. In groups B through E, ligation of all nonpancreatic splenic vessels was accomplished. In group B, no further manipulations were performed. In group C, an arteriovenous fistula was created. Groups D and E were identical to groups B and C, respectively, except for the induction of bile pancreatitis. During intravenous glucose tolerance testing, the mean (+/- SEM) basal-to-peak insulin difference was 10.1 +/- 3.5 microU/mL in group A, 16.3 +/- 3.6 microU/mL in group B, 14.8 +/- 5.1 microU/mL in group C, 16.4 +/- 3.1 microU/mL in group D, and 13.0 +/- 4.4 microU/mL in group E. Corresponding mean (+/- SEM) glucose clearance values were as follows: -0.907% +/- 0.24%/min, -0.867% +/- 0.14%/min, -1.056% +/- 0.21%/min, -1.365% +/- 0.26%/min, and -0.887% +/- 0.20%/min. These values were not significantly different. Ligation of all splenic arterial and venous branches resulted in a 64.8% to 78.3% reduction in splenic artery blood flow that was restored to 60.9% to 84.9% of basal flow by an arteriovenous fistula (groups C and E). In conclusion, the creation of a splenic arteriovenous fistula was not beneficial in this model and other factors (rejection or technical) should be considered in vascular thrombosis following segmental pancreatic transplantation."
CD012009,0,1080364,0,Unusual manifestations of pancreatic pseudocysts and their surgical management.,"Six cases representing selected complications of pancreatic pseudocyst are reported and their surgical management is discussed. Patients with mediastinal extension of a pseudocyst frequently present with symptoms in the chest rather than in the abdomen. Chronic recurrent pleural effusion, rich in protein and amylase, often accompanies mediastinal extension of a pancreatic pseudocyst. It is important to recognize that such an effusion almost certainly represents disruption of the pancreatic duct with formation of a pancreatic pseudocyst or a pancreaticopleural fistula. Internal drainage from below the diaphragm is the treatment of choice for pancreatic pseudocysts extending into the mediastinum. To be certain that obstructive jaundice is due to a pancreatic pseudocyst, there must be operative demonstration of compression of the common bile duct by the pseudocyst, relief of the obstruction by surgical drainage of the cyst, and subsequent disappearance of jaundice. Cysts that cause jaundice are located in the head of the pancreas, and cystoduodenostomy is the treatment of choice. Intraperitoneal rupture has been associated with a high mortality, but with adequate fluid replacement, prompt evacuation of the cyst contents from the peritoneal cavity, and adequate drainage, mortality can be lowered. Pancreatic ascites is much more common than is generally supposed and may result from a leaking pancreatic pseudocyst. In contrast to cirrhotic ascites, pancreatic ascites produces elevation of both the serum amylase level and protein concentration. Massive hemorrhage from pancreatic pseudocysts is usually due to the development of a false aneurysm in a branch of the celiac axis in the wall of the pseudocyst, with subsequent rupture of the aneurysm into the gut or peritoneal cavity. Any patient with a pancreatic pseudocyst who shows signs of bleeding should have prompt arteriography for determination of the bleeding site and appropriate surgical control. Pancreaticobronchial fistula is a rare complication. Treatment should be directed toward adequate drainage of the pseudocyst in the abdomen."

Trypsin infusion resulted in a depression of the secretory volume and protein and trypsinogen output. All these effects were reversed after additional infusion of trypsin inhibitor. Infusion of amylase or lipase in doses comparable to those of trypsin did not influence the secretory volume, protein or enzyme output. Likewise, intraduodenal bile infusion to rats with diverted bile-pancreatic juice did not change these parameters; also in rats with trypsin reinfused into the duodenum, bile infusion was without effect."
CD012009,0,18417081,0,A simple and safe anastomosis in pancreaticogastrostomy using mattress sutures.,"When a suture does not trap a sufficient volume of pancreatic parenchyma in the conventional pancreatic anastomosis, laceration may be caused by even modest tension. Therefore, we used mattress sutures with gastric wall, which works protectively. An opening was made on the posterior wall of the stomach. By using a 3-0 polypropylene monofilament thread with a straightened needle at each end, the proximal gastric wall, the pancreas, and the distal gastric wall were sutured sequentially to accomplish anastomosis in a U-like fashion. After 2 to 4 additional sutures were completed, the pancreatic stump was invaginated into the stomach and all sutures are tied. Mattress sutures were made on the pancreas, which was held between the superior and inferior walls of the stomach. Postoperative amylase levels in the drainage fluid decreased significantly and none of the 17 patients developed pancreatic fistula formation. The technique is simple and shortens the time required for anastomosis."

They can occur at any level of the alimentary tract from the oral cavity to the anus. Duodenal duplication accounts for approximately 7% of all intestinal duplications. A previously healthy 4-year 6-month old boy was admitted with progressive increasing vomiting. Physical examination was normal, the serum amylase level was moderately increased. Upper gastrointestinal series showed an extrinsic compression defect of the proximal duodenum. Ultrasonography showed a 3 cm diameter cyst in the head of the pancreas. A duplication was suggested. Helical CT cholangiography showed a communication between duplication and the biliopancreatic common channel. The biliary tree was normal. Surgical resection of the intrapancreatic lesion was performed. Microscopic examination of the specimen revealed a duodenal duplication."
CD012009,0,7912489,0,Safety and function of isolated Roux loop pancreaticojejunostomy after Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"A novel method of pancreatic anastomosis after proximal Whipple-type resection: classical pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD), has been evaluated over a 5-year period from 1987 to 1992 in 52 patients. Indications for resection included chronic pancreatitis (n = 9) and neoplasms (n = 43). Reconstruction involved a cephalad end-to-end duodeno-/gastro-jejunal anastomosis with a biliary anastomosis 6-8 cm downstream. A separate isolated defunctioned Roux loop was used to construct a duct-to-mucosa (Wirsung-jejunal) pancreaticojejunostomy. Median postoperative stay was 18.0 days (range 11-32 days); three deaths (operative mortality 5.8%) occurred due to sepsis (subhepatic abscess), profound hypoglycaemia and necrotising pancreatitis respectively. These deaths were not related to pancreatic fistula. There were no pancreatic leaks (defined as greater than 50 ml of amylase-rich fluid for more than 7 days). Postoperative exocrine pancreatic function was good as assessed by re-establishment of preoperative weight (achieved in 35 of 40, ie 88% of surviving PPPD patients), clinical steatorrhoea (present in 10 of 41, ie 24% of surviving patients resected for neoplasm), and the need for pancreatic exocrine supplements (required in only 4 of 41, ie 9.8% of surviving patients resected for neoplasm). Twenty patients considered to have normal pancreatic remnants underwent a p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) excretion test at 3 to 18 months after operation. Median PABA excretion index was 48% (range 24-100%). Isolated defunctioned duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy is a safe procedure offering good functional results after Whipple's PD or PPPD resection."

CD012009,0,11369981,0,Pancreaticogastrostomy following pancreaticoduodenectomy: review of 102 consecutive cases.,"Disruption of the pancreatic anastomosis with resultant sepsis is the cause of nearly 50% of deaths following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Traditionally, the pancreatic remnant is anastomosed to the jejunum. Pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) was introduced as an alternative by Waugh and Clagett in 1946 and by Park, Mackie, and Rhoads in 1967. The purpose of this retrospective review was to assess the safety of PG at a single institution. Between 1986 and 1998 a total of 102 patients underwent PG following PD. The indications for PD were periampullary carcinoma (n = 89), pancreatitis (n = 7), and miscellaneous (n = 6). Altogether, 80 patients underwent the traditional Whipple procedure and 22 the pylorus-preserving Whipple (PPW) procedure. The PG was performed by a single-layer invagination technique to the posterior gastric wall using interrupted silk sutures. Leaks from the pancreatic anastomosis were detected by measuring amylase in fluid obtained from surgically placed drains. Operative mortality was 3.9% (4/102). The cause of death was uncontrolled upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, sepsis, pulmonary embolus, and cardiac failure secondary to myocardial infarction. The mean operating time was 6.8 hours. Blood transfusion was given in 43 patients (42%), and the mean amount of the transfusion was 2.6 units. Nonfatal complications occurred in 35 patients (34%), and included leaks from the pancreatic anastomosis in 9 (8.8%), leaks from the biliary-enteric anastomosis in 4 (3.9%), and gastric paresis 7 (6.9%). Other complications included abscess, wound infection, colitis, delirium tremens, and hyperbilirubinemia. Discharge occurred 6 to 47 days (median 12 days) postoperatively and was prolonged in patients suffering from a complication. PD is associated with significant morbidity. PG is a safe alternative to pancreaticojejunostomy for managing the pancreatic remnant."

CD012009,0,1698047,0,Diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic injuries. An analysis of management principles.,"Ninety-one pancreatic injuries, 47 from blunt trauma, were reviewed with respect to management principles stressed in qi previous reviews. The pancreatic complication rate was 25%. Blunt injury was suspected preoperatively in only 30%. Even short-term observation led to morbidity. Operations done more than 6 hours after admission had a higher complication rate (45%) than those done less than 6 hours after admission (18%). Penrose drainage without a sump was not associated with increased complications. Distal pancreatectomy was done 32 times; splenectomy was done in only 18 patients. Individual duct ligation was rarely done and did not result in a high fistula rate. Pancreatic stump oversew with nonabsorbable suture was associated with a higher rate of pancreatic complications than absorbable suture (58% vs 30%). Only 56% of patients receiving distal pancreatectomy required hyperalimentation. Postoperative serum amylase values were not useful, and amylase values from drainage fluid predicted complications only when they were above 100,000 U/L. Details of pancreatic trauma management are less important than early operation in minimizing morbidity."
CD012009,0,9257101,0,Measurement of pancreatic blood flow to prevent pancreatic juice leakage after pancreas-preserving total gastrectomy for gastric cancer.,"In patients with gastric cancer, distal pancreatectomy was frequently performed for complete removal of the lymph nodes along the splenic artery, but this procedure sometimes induced pancreatic juice leakage, subphrenic abscess, and postoperative diabetes. To avoid these complications, pancreas-preserving total gastrectomy (PP) was developed by Maruyama et al. [World J Surg 1995; 19:552-536], with which the spleen, splenic artery, and fatty connective tissue including lymph nodes could be removed completely without distal pancreatectomy. From 1988 to 1995, 36 patients underwent PP in our department. Although there were no operative deaths and no patient developed postoperative diabetes, pancreatic juice leakage was observed in 4 patients (11.1%). We assumed that ischemia of the distal pancreas may have caused this pancreatic juice leakage and investigated the relationship between pancreatic blood flow (PBF) and this complication in 12 recent patients. A significant negative correlation between PBF in the pancreatic tail and the peak amylase level (PAL) in the drain fluid was demonstrated. Two patients with PBF values of 4.5 and 5.2 ml/min/100 g tissue, respectively, and a PAL of more than 2 x 10(5) U/l developed pancreatic juice leakage, whereas the 10 patients without this complication had PBF values above 6 ml/min/100 g tissue and a PAL of less than 2 x 10(4) U/l. These results suggest that measurement of PBF may be useful to predict the leakage of pancreatic juice after PP and that distal pancreatectomy may be preferable when PBF is extremely low."

We report seven children 3-13 years old with posttraumatic pancreatic pseudocysts who were managed with percutaneous catheter drainage. All procedures were performed with local anesthesia and intramuscular sedation under sonographic or CT guidance. Two of the pseudocysts were drained via a transgastric approach, the other five via direct transcutaneous access to the pseudocyst. The catheters were in place an average of 25 days (range, 8-66). There were no serious complications. Six patients became asymptomatic with return of the serum amylase to normal and resolution of the pseudocyst on follow-up sonograms. One patient, in whom the catheter became dislodged after 2 weeks, became asymptomatic, but he had a residual 2-cm pancreatic pseudocyst that resolved over the next 6 weeks. Our experience suggests that percutaneous drainage is a safe and effective method of treatment for traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children."

CD012009,0,16966032,0,Postoperative acute pancreatitis as a major determinant of postoperative delayed gastric emptying after pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"The aim of this study was to prospectively analyze the possible association of delayed gastric emptying and postoperative pancreatic complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Although hospital mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy is minimal, morbidity is still high; delayed gastric emptying is one of the most frequent complications. Thirty-nine consecutive patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy were included in this study: 14 females and 25 males (median age 65 years; range, 7-82). Delayed gastric emptying was defined as the need for a nasogastric tube or recurrent vomiting that prevented normal feeding on the 10th postoperative day. Blood analysis was performed on postoperative days 4, 6, and 10; Gastrografin examination on day 6; CT scan on days 2 and 5; and drain amylases were measured on day 5. Pancreatitis was defined as pancreatitis changes in CT scan interpreted by an experienced radiologist without knowing other data. Pancreatic fistula was defined according to the recent international recommendations. We had no mortality. Twelve patients (31%) developed delayed gastric emptying. Surgical (9/12 vs. 5/27; P = 0.001) but not medical complications occurred more often in the delayed gastric emptying group. Of the single complications, postoperative CT-detected pancreatitis (6/12 vs. 4/27; P = 0.03) and postoperative pancreatic fistula (5/12 vs. 1/27; P = 0.0007) were significantly associated with delayed gastric emptying compared with the patients without delayed gastric emptying. This pancreatitis was already detected in CT scan on day 2 in most patients (6/10, 60%). In delayed gastric emptying patients, the only parameters in blood analysis that differed significantly from patients without this complication were serum amylase activity (mean +/- SEM, 715 +/- 205 vs. 152 +/- 70 IU/L; P = 0.02), blood leukocyte count (16 +/- 2 vs. 9 +/- 0.6 x 10(9)/L; P = 0.007) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration (144 +/- 28 vs. 51 +/- 14 mg/L, P = 0.01). Postoperative pancreatic (subclinical) fistula was also associated with postoperative pancreatitis (6/10 vs. 0/29; P = 0.003). Preoperative coronary artery disease (OR = 16; 95% CI, 1.0-241; P = 0.05) and soft pancreatic texture at operation (OR = 9; 95% CI, 1.4-52; P = 0.02) were significant risk factors for the development of postoperative pancreatitis. The diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying after pancreaticoduodenectomy often follows postoperative pancreatitis. Delayed gastric emptying is also associated with postoperative pancreatic fistula, for which this pancreatitis seems to be a risk factor. Preoperative coronary artery disease and soft texture of the pancreas are significant risk factors for postoperative CT-detected pancreatitis."

However, valid comparisons for these studies cannot be made because the definition of leak is variable, and many patients deemed to have a leak are not sick. The aim of this study was to determine the meaning of the volume and amylase content of the effluent from surgical drains by comparing these values to actual clinical outcomes. From January 1996 to July 2002, 207 consecutive patients underwent PD. We considered a leak to be present if greater than 30 ml/day of drainage was observed from drains and if that drainage contained an amylase-rich fluid (greater than 5X serum) on or after postoperative day (POD) 5. Cases were then divided into three groups-no leak, chemical leak only (leak but asymptomatic), and a clinical leak group (leak that required therapeutic intervention, reoperation, readmission, or prolonged length of stay). Then the drainage volume and its amylase concentration for every postoperative day were compared between the three groups. There were no operative or hospital deaths, and the mean length of stay (LOS) was 11.2 +/- 6.1 days. Prolonged LOS was set at greater than 17 days (one standard deviation beyond the mean LOS for all cases). Leak was observed in 14% of cases (n = 29) and the patients were subsequently divided into these groups: no leak (n = 178), chemical leak only (n = 12), and clinical leak (n = 17). Surprisingly, the daily drain amylase values did not differ between the chemical leak group and the clinical leak group. The daily volume of drainage on POD 5-8 for the clinical leak group was significantly greater than the volumes of the other two groups, so that a combination of greater than 200 ml/day of drainage on POD 5 with an amylase greater than 5X serum had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 84% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99% for a clinically relevant leak. We used broad criteria from drainage effluent to include as many potential leaks as possible. This broad definition of leak selected 14% of the PD patients as having a leak; within this group, all of the clinical complications of leak occurred. By increasing the volume criteria from greater than 30 ml per day to greater than 200 ml per day, the PPV was increased from 59% to 84% while keeping NPV at 99%. Drain data based on the volume and amylase criteria of this study may be useful for early detection of a leak that will have clinical impact. This study's criteria for leak may be a good definition to design a clinical trial."
CD012009,0,15358331,0,Isolated Roux-loop pancreaticojejunostomy: a series of 61 patients with zero postoperative pancreaticoenteric leaks.,"There have been approximately 70 reported variations of reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). The pancreaticojejunal (PJ) anastomosis is the source of most reported morbidity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to identify the anastomotic leak rate in patients undergoing PD for malignant disease using a proximal isolated jejunal pancreatic anastomosis. Sixty-one consecutive patients undergoing PD (26 women and 35 men; age range, 41-79 years, mean age, 62 years). had an identical reconstruction. The PJ anastomosis was performed using the most proximal isolated jejunum in two layers: interrupted 4.0 Prolene was used to achieve mucosal/ductal continuity, and 3.0 Prolene was used for the serosal/parenchymal anastomosis, around an appropriately sized stent. All postoperative complications were recorded. A pancreatic leak was defined as persistent discharge of amylase-rich pancreatic drain fluid. The overall complication rate was 44% (27 of 61, including 15 chest infections, 8 wound infections, and 2 postoperative cardiac arrhythmias). There were 3 deaths (30-day mortality rate, 5%). One patient died after a cerebrovascular accident, one from respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, and the third of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus septicemia after small bowel ischemia caused by pressure necrosis from a drain. There were no PJ anastomotic leaks. This method of pancreatojejunostomy has produced a 0% leak rate in this center."
CD012009,0,8533593,0,Pancreatic ascites in children.,"We report on three children with pancreatic ascites confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) and treated with surgery. The children presented with ascites, malnutrition and severe weight loss. Pancreatic ascites was diagnosed by elevated ascitic fluid and serum amylase levels. ERCP demonstrated a pseudocyst and the site of disruption of the pancreatic duct, but not the etiology of the pancreatitis. Following a period of nutritional support, surgery was carried out. Two of the children underwent a stented transgastric drainage of the pseudocyst; a recurrent pseudocyst in one of the children required a revision cystojejunostomy. The third child was treated with a Roux-en-Y cystojejunostomy. All the children are pain-free and without ascites and are doing well on long-term follow-up. We conclude that pancreatic ascites must be considered in the differential diagnosis of intractable ascites in children. An ERCP is essential in planning management and cystoenterostomy is the definitive treatment."

The results were as follows: 1. Postoperative hyperamylasemia was found in 36.8% of all patients, with higher incidence of hyperamylasemia being in accordance with greater surgical intervention to the pancreas. 2. The isoamylase pattern of postoperative hyperamylasemia was dominant in the salivary type. 3. The levels of such serum pancreatic enzymes as lipase, trypsin and elastase 1 were higher in the pancreatic-type group than in the salivary-type group, particularly with the elastase 1 levels being statistically higher in the former. 4. Increases in peritoneal amylase activity were found in those cases of greater surgical intervention to the pancreas, postoperative hyperamylasemia and higher serum pancreatic isoamylase levels. 5. Diagnosis of postoperative pancreatitis was confirmed in one case by clinical and laboratory findings and CT examination. It might be concluded that postoperative high peritoneal amylase levels suggest occurrence or possible occurrence of postoperative pancreatitis."

CD012009,0,11677940,0,The first histological demonstration of pancreatic oxidative stress in human acute pancreatitis.,"Necrotizing acute pancreatitis is associated with an inflammatory explosion involving numerous pro-inflammatory mediator cascades and oxidative stress. Acinar oxygen free radical production aggravates pancreatic tissue damage, and promotes cellular adhesion molecule upregulation resulting in leukocyte adherence and activation. The cerium capture oxygen free radical histochemistry combined with reflectance confocal laser scanning microscopy allows the ""in situ"" histological demonstration of oxygen free radical formation in live tissues. Here we present a case report, where oxidative stress is demonstrated on a histological level for the first time in human acute pancreatitis. A 44-year-old male patient suffering from acute exacerbation of his chronic pancreatitis developed a pancreato-pleural fistula with amylase-rich left pleural exudate causing respiratory compromise. Subsequent to an urgent thoracic decompression a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed with the closure of abdomino-thoracic fistula. The postoperative course was uneventful, except for a transient pancreatico-cutaneous fistula, which healed after conservative treatment. To carry out cerium capture oxygen free radical histochemistry the resected pancreas specimen was readily perfused with cerium-chloride solution through the arteries on the resection surface. Frozen sections were cut, E-, P-selectin, ICAM and VCAM were labeled by immunofluorescence. The tumor-free margin of an identically treated pancreas carcinoma specimen served as a control. Intrapancreatic oxidative stress and cellular adhesion molecule expression were detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Numerous pancreatic acini and neighboring capillaries showed oxygen free radical-derived cerium-perhy-droxide depositions corresponding to strong local oxidative stress. Acinar cytoplasmic reflectance signals suggested xanthine-oxidase as a source of oxygen free radicals. These areas presented considerably increased endothelial P-selectin expression with adherent, oxygen free radical-producing polymorphonuclear leukocytes displaying pericellular cerium-reflectance. Modest ICAM upregulation was noted, E-selectin and VCAM expression was negligible. The control pancreas specimen showed minimal oxidative stress with weak, focal P-selectin expression. The development of deleterious pancreatic oxidative stress was based on indirect evidence in human acute pancreatitis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report demonstrating persistent intrapancreatic oxidative stress histologically in human acute pancreatitis. We have noted P-selectin overexpression with a preponderance in the areas of acinar oxidative stress."

A 39-year-old man had underwent gastric resection (Billroth I) and distal pancreaticojejunostomy for transsection of duodenal bulbus and pancreatic body. After 14 days later duodenal diverticulization was performed due to anastomotic stricture of the gastro-duodenostomy, which resulted in leakage of duodenal stump and voluminous fluids from drains were lasting about 5 weeks. Amylase (AMY) value was shown as high as 703,812 U/l in the exudate. SMS was injected by 100 micrograms, s, c, by three times a day for 24 days. The volume of exudate decreased immediately after the administration of SMS and to one-half in volume in 2 weeks. AMY also fell to 42, 378 U/l. The drain was removed two months after the third surgery. The patient was discharged on post operative day 200. SMS was known to inhibit secretion of bile and intestinal as well as pancreatic juice and its usefulness for leakage of the intestinal tract, especially of the duodenum, is suggested."

The grafted pancreas is difficult to salvage after complete thrombosis, especially arterial thrombosis, and graft pancreatectomy is required. We describe a patient presenting with a functioning pancreas graft with thromboses of the splenic artery (SA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK). A 37-year-old woman with a 20-year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus underwent SPK. The pancreaticoduodenal graft was implanted in the right iliac fossa with enteric drainage. A Carrel patch was anastomosed to the recipient's right common iliac artery, and the graft gastroduodenal artery was anastomosed to the common hepatic artery using an arterial I-graft. The donor portal vein was anastomosed to the recipient's inferior vena cava. Four days after surgery, graft thromboses were detected by Doppler ultrasound without increases in the serum amylase and blood glucose levels. Contrast enhanced computed tomography revealed thromboses in the SA, splenic vein and SMA. Selective angiography showed that blood flow was interrupted in the SA and SMA. However, pancreatic graft perfusion was maintained by the I-graft in the head of the pancreas and the transverse pancreatic artery in the body and tail of the pancreas. We performed percutaneous direct thrombolysis and adjuvant thrombolytic therapy. However, we had to stop the thrombolytic therapy because of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Thereafter, the postoperative course was uneventful and the pancreas graft was functioning with a fasting blood glucose level of 75 mg/dL, HbA1c of 5.1%, and serum C-peptide level of 1.9 ng/mL at 30 months post-transplantation."
CD012009,0,17955317,0,A soft pancreatic remnant is associated with increased drain fluid pancreatic amylase and serum CRP levels following pancreatoduodenectomy.,"The aim of this prospective study was to clarify differences in postoperative changes of serum or drainage fluid pancreatic amylase levels and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels between patients with a soft pancreatic texture and those with a hard pancreatic texture undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) with pancreaticogastrostomy. A total of 61 consecutive patients with resectable periampullary tumors undergoing PD were recruited. This population was divided into 27 patients with a hard pancreatic texture and 34 patients with a soft pancreatic texture. Drainage fluid total amylase or pancreatic amylase levels, serum total amylase or pancreatic amylase levels, and serum CRP levels were measured postoperatively. Clinicopathological data were also compared between two groups. Postoperative complications more frequently occurred in patients with a soft pancreatic texture compared with those with a hard pancreatic texture (P=0.029). Serum or drainage fluid pancreatic amylase levels and serum CRP levels of patients with a soft pancreatic texture were significantly higher than those of patients with a hard pancreatic texture after PD on postoperative days 1 and 2 (P<0.05). A soft pancreatic texture was identified as an only independent predictive factor of increased drainage fluid pancreatic amylase levels (P=0.006) and serum CRP levels (P=0.047). A soft pancreatic texture is closely associated with increased drainage fluid pancreatic amylase and serum CRP levels after PD. More careful post-PD management is needed for patients with a soft pancreatic texture."
CD012009,0,1709060,0,Acute pancreatitis--30 years' experience at a teaching hospital.,"Advances in medical technology and knowledge have influenced morbidity and mortality in surgically treated diseases. The authors have compiled four consecutive retrospective studies of demography, morbidity and mortality of patients with acute pancreatitis to summarize the experience from 1956 to 1985 at the Montreal General Hospital with 629 patients. The death rate has remained unchanged. Hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory failure have assumed lesser roles as major complicating factors. Renal failure and gram-negative aerobic pancreatic sepsis are the common causes of death. The last two reviews revealed that surgical debridement and drainage combined with appropriate biliary procedures salvaged two-thirds of the patients with sepsis. Deteriorating nutritional status, heralded by a fall of serum albumin level below 30 g/L, is associated with a poor prognosis. Interval cholecystectomy in patients with mild biliary tract pancreatitis is associated with a low death rate (0.01%)."

CD012009,0,23025959,1,A simple algorithm for drain management after pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"Pancreatic fistula (PF) continues to be the Achilles' heel of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with both morbidity and mortality linked to its occurrence. The optimal drain management strategy after PD remains unclear. We evaluated drain amylase (DA) levels on postoperative Day (POD) 0 to 5 in 76 consecutive patients undergoing PD to determine the patterns associated with PF. Of these 76 patients, eight patients (11%) developed Grade A, B, or C PF by International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula criteria. POD 1 DA levels correlated closely with PF rates when high (greater than 5000 U/L, 100% PF rate) and low (less than 100 U/L, 2% PF rate). In patients with intermediate POD 1 DA (100 to 5000 U/L), 42 and 74 per cent had low DA levels on POD 3 and 5, respectively, and the PF rate was four of 31 (13%). Overall, the temporal pattern of decreasing DA levels after PD correlates closely with the risk of PF, and only two patients (5%) developed PF after early DA levels had normalized. Based on these data, we propose an algorithm of monitoring DA daily with drain removal when the level is less than 100 U/L. In our patient group drain removal would have occurred on a mean of 1.8 days and median 1 day after surgery."

However, the key of an optimal management of patients with AP is based on an early discrimination between interstitial oedematous and necrotizing forms. The former resolves spontaneously whereas parenchymal necrosis acting as a focus for bacteria has a very high severity. In this respect, multifactor prognostic scoring systems and new biological assessments like C reactive protein are valuable methods for forecasting the prognosis of AP. However, these indicators of severity require a full 48 hour period of observation. In order to overcome these drawbacks, other prognostic criteria have been explored based mainly, on laboratory data. The most interesting ones are trypsinogen activation peptides and leucocyte elastase. Finally, the more useful tool is computed tomography (CT). Combined with high dose intravenous contrast agent, it allows an early identification of necrosis. Other goals of computed tomography are an accurate diagnosis of infection by guided needle aspirations and a preoperative recognition of devitalized and infected tissues, which require a careful surgical necrosectomy. A prolonged drainage is always recommended but relative merits of a conventional closed drainage and an open one are controversial. Another therapeutic challenge is gallstone associated to severe pancreatitis. An early stone removal is advocated by some authors but others prefer delayed surgery because of high mortality rates in case of emergency surgery. Delayed surgery until biological parameters of pancreatitis are normalized seems preferable. An early endoscopic sphincterotomy in an attractive alternative method."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of saline-coupled radiofrequency ablation (TissueLink) as an alternative to traditional methods of stump closure in an animal model of distal pancreatectomy. Forty swine were randomized after pancreatic transection and remnant stump was either oversewn in a traditional fashion (control) or treated with the device alone (TissueLink). Animals were killed and necropsied at 3 or 5 weeks postoperatively. Primary endpoints were the development of a pancreatic fistula defined as dye extravasation from the remnant duct, presence of undrained amylase-rich fluid collections/abscess, and greater than threefold drain/serum amylase after the third postoperative day. The incidence of pancreatic leak in the TissueLink group was 5.5 vs 42% in the control group (p = 0.01). There were no differences in operative time or other clinical parameters measured. Histologic analysis of the remnant pancreatic stumps confirmed our results. These data support our hypothesis that saline-coupled radiofrequency ablation leads to obliteration of ducts with a resultant decrease in pancreatic leak and subsequent complications. This technology may play a substantial role in preventing this dreaded complication in the clinical setting."

Although 81 patients underwent pancreas transplant between March 1985 and May 1995; 26 (32%) required CEC. Complications presented as urine leaks, other complications, and refractory metabolic acidosis. There were 13 patients who presented with a urine leak: 12 with acute abdominal pain, and 1 asymptomatic. Serum amylase and creatinine rose a mean of 823 IU and 0.61 mg/dl, respectively.

CD012009,0,3929496,0,[Allogeneic segmental heterotopic pancreas transplantation in the dog with reference to various drainage technics].,"In 35 pancreatectomized dogs, the donor pancreatic tail was transplanted by end-to-side anastomoses between the portal vein and the celiac axis to the femoral vessels of the host. To influence the exocrine pancreas secretion of the graft we applied different methods of drainage of the pancreatic duct: open drainage to the abdominal cavity (Group I, n = 15), occlusion of the duct by Neoprene (Group II, n = 12) and by Ethibloc (Group III, n = 8). Main complications were rejection crisis and pancreatitis. Segmental pancreas allografts were rejected in group I within about 34 days, in group II within about 11 days, in group III within about 13 days. The fasting blood glucose levels in all 3 groups returned to normal 2 days after transplantation. Better results were achieved in the open-duct and Ethibloc-occluded grafts. 3 weeks after transplantation, a delayed and diminished increase of insulin concentration after glucose stimulation was observed compared to the dogs of the control group. Peak insulin values were significantly higher (p 0.01) in group I compared to group II. Histologically acinar atrophy with replacement by fibrous tissue occurred in all groups after 2 weeks. The least severe histological changes were observed in group II. The best results were achieved by the open-duct technique, whereas the occlusion groups showed a high rate of early complications like rejection, venous thrombosis and pancreatitis."

Operative technique and assessment of graft function.,"A large animal model for substitutive pancreaticosplenic composite transplantation with urinary drainage to the bladder has been developed in the pig. Transplantations were performed in 7 nontissue-typed donor-recipient combinations without immunosuppressive medication. Six recipients showed perfect graft function at least until the 5th postoperative day. Blood glucose, intravenous glucose tolerance tests and urine amylase concentrations proved to be sensitive markers of graft function. Scintigraphic follow-up examination with 99mTc tin colloid could only record perfusion of the splenic transplantation. With this model the role of the spleen in pancreaticosplenic composite transplantations can be studied in forthcoming experiments."
CD012009,0,17114013,0,"Postoperative pancreatic fistulas are not equivalent after proximal, distal, and central pancreatectomy.","It is uncertain whether postoperative pancreatic fistulas after distal and central pancreatectomies behave similarly to those after pancreaticoduodenectomy. To date, this concept has not been validated either clinically or economically. Overall, 256 consecutive pancreatic resections from October 2001 to February 2006 (184 pancreaticoduodenectomies, 66 distal pancreatectomies, and 6 central pancreatectomies) were evaluated according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula classification scheme. Pancreatic fistula was defined as any measurable drainage on or after postoperative day 3, with amylase content greater than three times the normal serum value. Outcomes were divided into four grades: (1) no fistula, (2) grade A: biochemical fistula without clinical sequelae, (3) grade B: fistula requiring any therapeutic intervention, or (4) grade C: fistula with severe clinical sequelae. Grades B and C are considered clinically relevant fistulas based on worsening morbidity, increased length of stay, frequent hospital readmission, and increased costs/resource utilization. Clinical and economic outcomes were compared-grade for grade-across the three resection types. Fistulas of any extent (Grades A-C) occurred in one third of all patients; two thirds had no fistula. Overall, there were 16 readmissions (6%), six reoperations (2%), and no deaths attributable to pancreatic fistula. Outcomes between no fistula and grade A patients were identical across resection types, though grade A fistula was more common in distal pancreatectomy. For each resection type, length of stay and costs progressively increased with grades B and C. However, the negative impact of these clinically relevant fistulas varied between resection types. Rates for intensive care unit admission and rehabilitation placement were higher among pancreaticoduodenectomy patients. Total parenteral nutrition and antibiotic use were similar, but percutaneous drainage was used more often for distal pancreatectomy. Grade B fistula was more severe after distal pancreatectomy, as indicated by increased length of stay, readmissions, and total cost. Although reoperation rates for grade C fistulas were equivalent, intervals to reoperation were substantially longer after distal and central pancreatectomies. When classified according to International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula criteria, clinically relevant pancreatic fistulas behaved differently depending on type of pancreatectomy. This translates into variable severity that guides management decisions, which ultimately dictate clinical outcomes and economic impact."

CD012009,0,17523330,0,Huge pseudocyst of the pancreas caused by poorly differentiated invasive ductal adenocarcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells: report of a case.,"A 72-year-old man presented with several week's abdominal distension and jaundice. Under the tentative diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocyst of 22cm in diameter, a percutaneous drainage was performed. Despite the reduction of the pseudocyst, his serum total bilirubin level was increased. At this time, abdominal computed tomography scan showed a tumor at the uncinate process of the pancreas. After the biliary decompression, a total pancreatectomy with the resection of pseudocyst walls and splenectomy was performed. It was histologically proven to be poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma in combination with osteoclast-like giant cells. The pseudocyst was considered to be due to the stenosis of the main pancreatic duct caused by carcinoma of the uncinate process. Five months later, he died of recurrent carcinomatous peritonitis. Osteoclast-like giant cell tumor is a very rare neoplasm, the origin and prognosis of which still remain obscure. However, it has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic changes of the pancreas, especially of pseudocyst. Furthermore, detailed surveys are needed in cases of pseudocyst of the pancreas without chronic pancreatitis, in order to identify small carcinoma of the pancreas."
CD012009,0,6159958,0,Analysis of 29 cases of pancreatic pseudocyst treated surgically.,Twenty-nine cases of pancreatic pseudocyst requiring operative management were reviewed to determine the method of diagnosis and to analyse the results of internal and external drainage. Pain and the presence of an intra-abdominal mass were the two most common clinical features in the 29 patients. Serum amylase values were elevated in 50%. Diagnosis was confirmed by barium contrast roentgenography and abdominal ultrasonography in 60% of cases. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was a valuable diagnotic technique in four problem cases. The most common form of surgical treatment was internal drainage of the pseudocyst (18 patients). Th mortality resulting from internal drainage was 6% and there was an overall complication rate of 44%. External drainage was carried out in seven patients (six required emergency operation). The mortality associated with external drainage was 43% and the overall complication rate 86%.
CD012009,0,23578342,0,"[Pancreatic fistula - definition, risk factors and treatment options].","Pancreatic fistula is a common complication after pancreatic resections. Its incidence oscillates between 10 and 30%. The differences in the incidence cited in the studies are due to the various fistula definitions. According to ISGPF, pancreatic fistula is an output -via an operatively placed drain (or a subsequently placed percutaneous drain) - of any measurable volume of drain fluid on or after postoperative day 3, with an amylase content higher than 3 times the upper normal serum value. The fistula is then classified according to the clinical impact in grades A, B, and C. There are known three risk factor categories for the development of pancreatic fistula: the risk related to the pancreatic disease, to the patient, and to the surgical procedure. Most of the risk factors for the development of pancreatic fistula cannot be influenced either prior to or during the surgery. There are two basic options for the prevention of pancreatic fistula: pharmacological intervention (administration of somatostatin and its analogues) and technical modifications of the pancreatic remnant treatment. However, the routine administration of somatostatin and its analogues is not advisable in all pancreatic surgical procedures. In high risk cases the selective administration is preferred. The second option is modification of pancreatic remnant treatment. Most of the studies dealing with various modifications of the pancreatic remnant treatment were retrospective with lower level of evidence. There were only a few properly designed randomized trials, and most of them did not prove benefit of one method over another. It has been shown that the results depend on the experience of a given surgical department, and above all on the experience of an individual surgeon who performs the pancreatic resection. The therapy of pancreatic fistula is based on the clinical severity. Conservative approach is warranted in most patients. In cases when reoperation is required, there are two basic strategies: surgical drainage of the collections, and completion of total pancreatectomy. Total pancreatectomy was preferred in the past, however, this procedure is technically very demanding with mortality up to 80 per cent. Nowadays, most of the authors prefer surgical drainage; this procedure is technically less demanding, has lower mortality, the endocrine function of pancreas is protected, and the patients usually need no further interventions."

CD012009,0,17508252,0,Distal pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis: risk factors for postoperative pancreatic fistula.,"One of the most common complications after distal pancreatectomy is a fistula from the pancreatic remnant. Factors influencing the development of a pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy have not been clearly elucidated. The records of 91 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis between 1995 and 2003 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Average daily volume and amylase concentration between postoperative days 2 and 20 from drains located at the pancreatic resection site were compared to clinical variables. Out of 137 pre- and intraoperative clinical variables, multivariate analysis showed serum creatinine (t = 3.05, p = 0.004), history of intraabdominal operation (t = -2.68, p = 0.01), right-sided pancreatic duct dilation (t = 2.65, p = 0.01), synchronous cholecystectomy (t = 2.53, p = 0.02), and serum albumin (t = -2.19, p = 0.04) to be independently associated with drain volume. Drain amylase concentration was linked to serum creatinine (t = 8.55, p < 0.001), blood urea nitrogen (t = -3.43, p = .001), preoperative parenteral nutrition (t = 2.56, p = .01), and serum alkaline phosphatase (t = 2.51, p = 0.01). There was no correlation between the degree of fibrosis and drain output. Technique of pancreatic transection and presence of suture closure of the pancreatic duct did not affect drain output. In conclusion, the amount and amylase concentration of postsurgical drainage after distal pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis is dependent on markers of renal dysfunction, malnutrition, biliary disease, and possibly inflammation. These factors, if medically reversible, should be addressed in patients who are candidates for distal pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis."
CD012009,0,16998250,0,Issues in management of pancreatic pseudocysts.,"Pancreatic pseudocysts (PPs) comprise more than 80% of the cystic lesions of the pancreas and cause complications in 7-25% of patients with pancreatitis or pancreatic trauma. The first step in the management of PPs is to exclude a cystic tumor. A history of pancreatitis, no septation, solid components or mural calcification on CT scan and high amylase content at aspiration favor a diagnosis of PP. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided FNAC is a valuable diagnostic aid. Intervention is indicated for PPs which are symptomatic, in a phase of growth, complicated (infected, hemorrhage, biliary or bowel obstruction) or in those occurring together with chronic pancreatitis and when malignancy cannot be unequivocally excluded. The current options include percutaneous catheter drainage, endoscopy and surgery. The choice depends on the mode of presentation, the cystic morphology and available technical expertise. Percutaneous catheter drainage is recommended as a temporizing measure in poor surgical candidates with immature, complicated or infected PPs. The limitations include secondary infection and pancreatic fistula in 10-20% of patients which increase complications following eventual definitive surgery. Endoscopic therapy for PPs including cystic-enteric drainage (and transpapillary drainage), is an option for PPs which bulge into the enteric lumen which have a wall thickness of less than 1 cm and the absence of major vascular structures on EUS in the proposed tract or those which communicate with the pancreatic duct above a stricture. Surgical internal drainage remains the gold standard and is the procedure of choice for cysts which are symptomatic or complicated or those having a mature wall,. Being more versatile, a cystojejunostomy is preferred for giant pseudocysts (>15 cm) which are predominantly inframesocolic or are in an unusual location. In PPs with coexisting chronic pancreatitis and a dilated pancreatic duct, duct drainage procedures (such as longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy) should be preferred to a cyst drainage procedure."
CD012009,0,12222912,0,Long-term results after cholecystectomy alone for patients with pancreaticobiliary maljunction without bile duct dilatation.,"A pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PB-MJ) without bile duct dilatation is relatively rare. The standard treatment for these patients remains controversial. In this study, we followed up the patients with PB-MJ without bile duct dilatation who mainly underwent a cholecystectomy alone. Eighteen adult patients with PB-MJ without bile duct dilatation (8 males and 10 females with a mean age of 54.8 years) were treated surgically. When the diameter of the common bile duct was less than 10 mm, such bile ducts were diagnosed to have no dilatation. The main clinical indications for surgery were cholecystolithiasis in 12 patients, choledocholithiasis in 3, cholecystocholedocholithiasis in 1, and carcinoma of the gallbladder in 2. The amylase levels of gallbladder bile in 14 patients ranged from 115 to 454,000 IU/ml. A simple cholecystectomy was performed in 12 patients, a cholecystectomy with bile duct drainage was performed in 3, a cholecystectomy with a choledochojejunostomy without bile duct resection was performed in 1, and a cholecystectomy with a lymph node dissection was performed in 2. Three patients died of other diseases. The remaining 15 patients have all been doing well for 20-209 months after surgery. In conclusion, a prophylactic resection of the extrahepatic bile duct and biliary diversion could be unnecessary for patients with PB-MJ without bile duct dilatation, when no bile stasis, such as choledocholithiasis, is observed."

CD012009,0,9162768,0,[Results of use of sandostatin in pancreatoduodenal resections].,"From February 1995 to July 1996 pancreato-duodenal resection has been performed in 12 patients in RCS (7 men and 5 women, mean age 53.6 years). The operation was indicated in malignant tumors of the pancreatic head, big duodenal papilla, distal part of common bile tract (9 patients); benign diseases of pancreas (3 patients). Sandostatin (0.3 mg/day for 4-7 days) was used in all cases to prevent postoperative pancreatitis and pancreato-jejuno-anastomosis incompetence. The levels of alphfa-amylase, blood glucose, leucocytes were monitored, as well as the duration of pancreato-jejuno-anastomosis drainage use, rate and seriousness of postoperative complications and duration of in-patient treatment. The results were compared to a control group, consisting of 6 men and 6 women (mean age 53.8 years) with malignant tumours of big duodenal papilla, head of the pancreas, common bile tract. The use of Sandostatin has decreased the level of alphfa-amylase in the first postoperative day to 292.8 +/- 152.2 u/l vs. 594.9 +/- 368.79 in a control group (p > 0.05), duration of the drainage use: 6.1 +/- 1.5 days vs. 12.9 +/- 7.2 days (p < 0.05). The number and rate of severity of postoperative complications were significantly less: 58.3% vs. 100%. The frequency of pancreato-jejuno-anastomosis incompetence has decreased 3 times; the rate of abdominal cavity abscesses has decreased by 30%, the number of bile tract complications has decreased too (1 vs. 2). The rates of postoperative mortality were 8.3% in both groups.

CD012009,0,2580453,0,Acute pancreatitis after cardiopulmonary bypass.,"We have described a spectrum of pancreatic surgery after cardiopulmonary bypass. At one end is a subclinical lesion which was manifested only by elevations in serum isoamylase levels (27 percent of patients) and increased ribonuclease levels (13 percent of patients) in asymptomatic patients followed after cardiac surgery. At the other end is a severe and often lethal necrotizing pancreatitis. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis was found at autopsy in 25 percent of 138 patients who died after cardiac surgery, and it correlated strongly with low output, acute tubular necrosis, and infarction of the liver, spleen, or bowel. It was the principal cause of death in 4 percent of these patients. In addition, 24 percent of 38 nonsurgical patients who died from cardiac failure and hypoperfusion had acute pancreatitis at autopsy, whereas acute pancreatitis was not observed in 55 nonsurgical patients who died without a significant period of low output. Acute pancreatitis was recognized postoperatively in 12 patients (0.2 percent). Three had mild pancreatitis, and all responded well to conservative therapy. In nine patients, fulminant necrotizing pancreatitis developed. Their courses were characterized by significant early postoperative hemodynamic compromise, abdominal distention, ileus, fever, and episodes of late vascular instability associated with hypocalcemia. The diagnosis of pancreatitis was usually missed because of the absence of pain, tenderness and hyperamylasemia. The diagnosis was confirmed at laparotomy in eight patients and at autopsy in one. The only two survivors among the nine with severe cases had aggressive mobilization, debridement, and wide drainage of the necrotic pancreas. We suggest that a mild subclinical injury to the pancreas may occur as a consequence of cardiopulmonary bypass and may progress to severe ischemic necrosis if hypoperfusion follows in the postoperative period, the presentation of necrotizing pancreatitis may be atypical in the cardiac surgical patient and should be considered if nonspecific abdominal symptoms are present, and aggressive debridement and drainage may be the optimal treatment for aggressive forms of this disease."

They all were divided into 3 groups: 1st was treated with octreotide, 2nd - with octreotide-depo, 3rd - with 5-ftoruracil and dalargin. Patients of the 3rd group showed the highest levels of α-amylase in both blood and drainage fluid during the early postoperative period. The frequency and severity of postoperative complication rates were the lowest in those patients, who received octreotide-depo and was 3,06%; whereas among patients of the 2nd group it was 16,8% and among those, who were treated with 5-ftoruracil and dalargin, it was 22,4%. The destructive forms of pancreatitis were registered in 2nd and 3rd groups in 1 and 3 patients, respectively.

Beside the clinical picture, the diagnosis was anticipated by the high amylase levels present in the fluid obtained by paracentesis or thoracocentesis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the radiological analysis of the pancreatic duct system, when an endoscopic retrograde pancreatography was performed in seven patients, one pancreatography was carried out during surgery in five cases, and one patient underwent an injection of hydrosoluble contrast in the pleural cavity. The treatment was a latero-lateral pancreaticojejunoanastomosis in five cases, associated with a corpora-caudal pancreatectomy in four patients; a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy was performed in one case. Two patients underwent a cystoenteroanastomosis, while the option chosen in the last four cases was an external drainage. One patient refused to undergo surgical treatment. Operation mortality was null. The conclusion was that an adequate surgical treatment results in the occlusion of the internal pancreatic fistula and, furthermore, allows for the definitive resolution of underlying pancreatic affection."

We report a case of a 17-year-old man, with recurrent liver hydatid cyst, who presented with severe upper abdominal pain, vomiting, jaundice. Amylase and bilirubin were elevated. Abdominal CT scan showed a cystic lesion in the dome of the liver and a diffusely swollen pancreas. At endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) the common bile duct was dilated with fragments of hydatid membrane. A sphincterotomy was performed and hydatid membranes were extracted, after which the patient made an uneventful recovery and the level of amylase and bilirubin normalized. After two weeks a new episode of hydatid rupture occurred with clinical presentation of cholangitis. Emergency surgery was performed, which consisted of cystectomy, suture of intracavitary bile fistula, omentoplasty, choledochotomy with extraction of the hydatid membranes and common bile duct drainage. There were no relapses during 5 years follow-up. This case report highlights that ERCP and sphincterotomy are considered the procedures of choice in acute pancreatitis induced by biliary rupture of the hydatid cyst and surgical treatment is considered to be the only definitive treatment of the hydatic cystic lesion of the liver with intrabiliary rupture."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of drain/plasma pancreatic amylase values on postoperative day 1 (DPA1/PPA1) in POPF by means of a systemic review and meta-analysis.Online journal databases and a manual search up to March 2015 were used. Studies clearly documenting DPA1 or PPA1 in predicting overall POPF (Grade 0 vs A+B+C) or clinically relevant POPF (Grade 0+A vs B+C) following pancreatic surgery were selected. Pooled predictive parameters were performed using STATA 12.0.Fifteen studies were finally identified with a total of 4331 patients. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of DPA1 were 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.96) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.64-0.86) for predicting overall POPF and 0.79 (95% CI 0.61-0.90) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.74-0.89) for predicting clinically relevant POPF. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of PPA1 were 0.74 (95% CI 0.63-0.82) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.55-0.70) for overall POPF. After the DPA1 at/over cutoff values for overall POPF or clinically relevant POPF, corresponding post-test probability (Post-test (+)) (if pretest probability was 50%) was 80% and 82% respectively, while, if values were below the cutoff values, the post-test probability (Post-test (-)) was 10% and 20% respectively. Post-test (+) and Post-test (-) of PPA1 for overall POPF were 66% and 30% respectively. In subgroup analysis, the summary sensitivities of cutoff <1000 group and cutoff >1000 group were 0.96 (0.92-0.98) and 0.85 (0.64-0.95), respectively; the summary specificities were 0.59 (0.44-0.72) and 0.86 (0.80-0.91) respectively. Positive LR were 2.3 (1.7-3.3) and 6.2 (3.7-10.2) respectively. Negative LR were 0.06 (0.03-0.14) and 0.18 (0.07-0.47) respectively.DPA1 is a useful predictive test for overall POPF and clinically relevant POPF which has good sensitivity and specificity based on the current studies. Meanwhile, it should be cautiously applied to clinical practice because cutoffs had a wide range between studies."

CD012009,0,3575310,0,Pancreatopleural fistula.,"The clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects of 27 patients with pancreatopleural fistula (PPF) reported in the literature, and two additional patients managed by the authors, form the basis of this report. The diagnosis of PPF is based on the triad of massive pleural effusions, elevated pleural fluid amylase, and protein levels. PPF is a complication of chronic fibrocalcific pancreatitis in most cases. It may develop as a consequence of disruption of a dilated obstructed pancreatic duct. Pseudocysts are involved in the process in at least half of reported cases. A substantial number of PPF will close spontaneously utilizing conservative measures including pancreatic rest, total parenteral nutrition, and repeated thoracentesis. Surgical correction of the underlying pancreatic disease, including ductal decompression and drainage or resection of associated pseudocysts, is indicated to prevent recurrence of the fistula and to avoid other complications of advanced chronic pancreatitis. Associated terminal biliary obstruction should be identified and managed with biliary-enteric bypass."
CD012009,0,2893556,0,Treatment of pancreatic cutaneous fistulas with a somatostatin analog.,"Five pancreatic cutaneous fistulas were treated by subcutaneous administration of a long-acting synthetic analog of somatostatin, SMS 201-995. Patients included four men and one woman who ranged in age from 52 to 77 years. The fistulas developed after drainage of a pancreatic abscess, biopsy of a pancreatic mass, splenectomies for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and Felty's syndrome, and operative trauma, respectively. Fistula output consisted of 1,000 ml/day of amylase- and lipase-rich fluid in the patient with a pancreatic biopsy. The other four patients had low-output fistulas (100 to 250 ml/day) that had been draining for 1 to 12 months. Direct communication with the pancreatic duct was demonstrated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, sinography, or both in four of the five patients. Fistula output decreased from 340 +/- 376 ml/day to 63 +/- 36 ml/day on the first day of therapy with two daily doses of 0.05 mg SMS 201-995 (p less than 0.03) and to 13 +/- 19 ml/day on the seventh day of therapy (p less than 0.03). Two patients had prompt closure of their fistulas and one closed in 3 months. One patient with chronic pancreatitis and a duct stricture and one patient with recurring infection did not achieve permanent fistula closure with SMS 201-995. Because of its safety, ease of administration, and efficacy in decreasing fistula output, we believe somatostatin analog therapy is beneficial in hastening closure of pancreatic fistulas."
CD012009,0,12201565,0,Non-stented pancreaticogastrostomy after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.,We hypothesized that neutralization of the gastric acidity by alkaline pancreatic secretion via a non-stented pancreaticogastrostomy after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (non-stented PPPD-PG) might provide protection against marginal or stress ulcer. Surgical risk of non-stented pancreaticogastrostomy was also assessed to clarify the importance of stenting in pancreatic anastomosis.
CD012009,0,12850681,0,A comparison of pancreaticogastrostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy following pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"This retrospective study compares the results of pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) and pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) in our institution, which has extensive experience in both techniques. Between the years of June 1995 and June 2001, 214 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) at our institution. Of these 177 had PG and 97 had pancreatojejunostomy (PJ). There were 117 (54.6%) males and 97 (45.3%) females with a mean age of 64.2 +/- 12.4 years. Indications for surgery were pancreatic adenocarcinoma in 101 (47.2%), ampullary adenocarcinoma in 36 (16.9%), distal bile duct adenocarcinoma in 22 (10.2%), duodenal adenocarcinoma in 9 (4.2%), and miscellaneous causes in 46 (21.4%) of patients. Preoperatively, significant differences in the groups were that the patients undergoing PJ were significantly younger than those undergoing PG. Also noted preoperatively, was that the patients undergoing PG had a significantly lower direct bilirubin than those undergoing PJ. With regard to intraoperative parameters, operative time was significantly shorter in the PJ group when compared to the PG group. When the patients who did not develop fistula (N = 186) were compared to those who developed fistula (N = 28) the significant differences were that the patients who developed fistula were more likely to have hypertension preoperatively and a higher alkaline phosphatase. They also showed a significantly higher drain amylase and were likely to have surgery for ampullary, distal bile duct or duodenal carcinoma rather than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In addition, those patients who developed fistula had a significantly longer postoperative stay, a larger number of intraabdominal abscesses and leaks at the biliary anastomosis. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in the PJ group compared to the PG (4 vs. 0, P = 0.041). There was a significantly larger number of bile leaks in the PJ group when compared to the PG (6 vs. 1, P = 0.048). In addition, the PJ group required a significantly larger number of new CT guided drains to control infection (8 vs. 2, P = 0.046) and the PJ group required a larger number of re-explorations to control infection or bleeding (5 vs. 0, P = 0.018). However, the pancreatic fistula rate was not different between the two groups (12% [PG] vs. 14% [PJ]). This retrospective analysis shows that safety of PG can be performed safely and is associated with less complications than PJ and proposes PG as a suitable and safe alternative to PJ for the management of the pancreatic remnant following PD."

CD012009,0,22989845,0,Bilateral pleural fluid caused by a pancreaticopleural fistula requiring surgical treatment.,"A 53-year-old man developed bilateral pleural effusion with respiratory failure. The amylase level in the pleural effusion was elevated. He had neither abdominal symptoms nor abdominal physical findings. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) also showed no abnormalities. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was non-diagnostic, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and subsequent CT showed a fistula connecting the pancreatic duct with the right pleural cavity. The pleural effusion was refractory to drug therapy, leading to the need for surgical intervention. The pathological findings revealed chronic pancreatitis without pseudocysts. The elevated pancreatic amylase in the pleural effusion offered an important clue to the correct diagnosis."

Modern imaging procedures detect more frequently neuroendocrine pancreatic tumours. A typical feature of the neuroendocrine pancreatic tumour is that this kind of tumour is mostly small with a size of 1 to 2 cm. Due to their mostly small size they are suited to a laparoscopic approach. We report here the feasibility and surgical technique of a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and partial gastric resection due to a neuroendocrine pancreatic tumour.

CD012009,0,21477098,0,Eosinophilia as an early indicator of pancreatic allograft rejection.,"Monitoring pancreas transplant recipients for rejection is an inexact science. Serial monitoring of urinary amylase has been used for patients with a bladder-drained pancreas. An increase in serum amylase and lipase has been utilized as an in vivo measure of pancreas rejection in patients with enteric pancreatic exocrine drainage. Decreases in urinary amylase or increases in serum amylase or lipase, respectively, in these two different types of surgical drainage would prompt a pancreas biopsy for histologic confirmation of rejection. Herein, we describe the case of an enteric-drained pancreatic transplant recipient who presented with peripheral eosinophilia at least one month before she developed increases in serum amylase and lipase. A pancreas allograft biopsy indicated eosinophilic acute cellular rejection. Peripheral eosinophilia may be a useful early indicator of pancreas graft rejection preceding changes in serum pancreatic enzymes by approximately one month."
CD012009,0,9046360,0,Effect of glucagon and somatostatin on pancreatic secretion in dogs.,"The authors investigated the effects of glucagon and a somatostatin preparation (Stilamin) on the secretion volume and on the secreted and absorbed enzyme levels of the pancreas. Four groups of dogs with an artificial pancreatic fistula were given a single intravenous injection of glucagon (group I, n = 8), intravenous drip-infusion of glucagon (group II, n = 8), intravenous drip-infusion of somatostatin (group III, n = 10) and intravenous drip-infusion of the carrier fluid, physiological sodium-chloride (control, group IV, n = 5), respectively. Pancreatic juices were collected and volume, pH, bicarbonate, amilase, lipase, trypsin and protein contents were determined. Serum amilase and lipase levels before and at the termination of the experiment were also measured. Intravenous drip-infusion of both Glucagon and Stilamin decreased pancreatic secretion, Stilamin being more effective than Glucagon. On the other hand, a single i.v. injection of Glucagon resulted in an increased secretion. The authors suggest that based on the observed inhibitory effect on pancreatic secretion, both glucagon and somatostatin could be used to reduce postoperative complications of pancreatic operations in the clinical practice."

CD012009,0,3998272,0,Percutaneous peritoneal dialysis as an early treatment of acute necrotic hemorrhagic pancreatitis.,"In this study, 8 years experience of early percutaneous peritoneal dialysis (PPD) in the treatment of acute necrotic hemorrhagic pancreatitis (ANHP) are presented. The introduction of methemalbuminemia and the presence of specific ascites rich in amylase, lipase and methemalbumin as early indicators of the presence of ANHP enabled us to confirm the diagnosis in 53 patients, after which early institution of PPD was possible. Thirty patients survived by PPD alone and 9 patients survived by the combination of PPD and surgery, giving an overall mortality rate of 26.4%. A better survival rate of patients having a high Ranson prognostic score was obtained. The introduction of computerized axial tomography (CAT), in 1980 into our hospital allowed us to use this technique for followup. This change and the fact that we were more experienced with PPD, divided our study into two periods: 1976 to 1979, 22 patients; 1980 to 1983, 31 patients. A more aggressive medical approach to treating ANHP was observed during the second period. Surgery was delayed compared to the first period and confined to treating late complications, such as infections, by drainage procedures. Despite the fact that the results were not statistically different, a trend towards a lower mortality rate (19.3%) in the second period compared to the first period (36%) was obtained."
CD012009,0,1780489,0,[Epidural blockade for analgesia and treatment of acute pancreatitis].,"The effect of a fractional epidural blockade on acute pancreatitis was investigated in a prospective study. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Thoracic (20 patients) or lumbar (six patients) epidural blockade was carried out in 26 patients with severe abdominal conditions comprising sub-ileus in 100%, pancreatic edema indicated by sonography/computer tomography in 57.8%, and necrosis of the pancreas in 34.6%. RESULTS. On average, 3.4 (1-6) injections with single doses of 6-20 ml 0.25% bupivacaine were injected per day. In four patients, morphine (up to 4 mg per 24 h) was added to the local anesthetic. The duration of treatment was between 1 and 15 days. After 10.5% of the injections, the systolic pressure decreased by more than 20%, and after 12.8% of the injections the blood pressure decreased by more than 30%. Hypotension of more than 30% was treated with 0.3 to 0.5 ml theodrenaline (Akrinor) and/or 0.1 to 0.2 mg dihydro-ergotamine (Dihydergot). General analgesics had to be administered in addition on 21.8% of the treatment days and intensive care treatment (artificial ventilation) on 32% of the treatment days. The duration of epidural analgesia varied between 1 and 15 days depending on the intensity of symptoms (pain, ileus). Within 4 days, the enzyme activity of the lipase fell from 8120 to 427 IU, and that of alpha amylase fell from 1401 to 143 IU. In 3 patients laparotomy (for drainage) was performed. An ERCP was carried out in 16 patients. Cardiopulmonary failure necessitated artificial ventilation over a period of 1-15 days in 6 patients; the epidural blockade was continued during the artificial ventilation. Cholecystectomy was carried out as an interval operation in 6 patients. No neurological complications were observed. All patients survived and were discharged from hospital."

CD012009,0,15656235,0,[Evidence based surgery of cancer of head of pancreas].,"Physicians and surgeons who treat patients with gastrointestinal or hepatic disease must prescribe the most appropriate diagnostic tests, together with an accurate prognosis and effective and safe therapy. This paper examines the best modalities of surgical treatment for cancer of the pancreas, in an evidence-based approach. Evidence was classified as follows: Grade A : evidence from large randomized controlled trials (RCT) or systematic reviews (including meta-analyses) of multiple randomized trials which collectively have at least as much data as one single well-defined trial. Grade B: evidence from at least one high-quality study of non-randomized cohorts or evidence from at least one high-quality case-control study or one high-quality case series. Grade C: opinions from experts without references or access to any of the foregoing The data were obtained from Medline and from controlled randomized trials listed in the Cochrane Library up to the end of 2003. Two series (grade B) showed the superiority of Whipple over total pancreatectomy, with respective median survival times of 12.6 months and 9.6 months. Extensive lymphadenectomy (grade A) in patients with positive lymph nodes gave significantly better survival than standard resection in one trial, but this was not confirmed in the other trial. Results of pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) were not different from those of the Whipple procedure on postoperative mortality, morbidity or survival (grade A). Portal vein resection increased the resectability rate. Post-operative mortality was not increased: survival was not different in four studies and was shorter in another four studies (grade C). Low-dose postoperative erythromycin accelerates gastric emptying if the right gastric artery is preserved (grade A). One trial suggests that pancreaticogastrostomy reduces the risk of pancreatic fistula. The two other trials are controversial and showed no difference. One prospective non randomized study showed that stenting in pancreaticojejunostomy reduces the risk of pancreatic fistulae and intraabdominal abscess. To prevent this risk of pancreatic fistula, six controlled trials involving patients receiving octreotride were performed Three European trials showed a smaller volume of abdominal drainage fluid and an abnormal amylase concentration; however, two American trials failed to demonstrate a significant difference. Occlusion of the pancreatic duct with fibrin glue did not reduce the risk of pancreatic fistula, but increased the risk of developing diabetes. Intraabdominal drainage after pancreatic resection significantly increased post-operative complications (grade A). Surgical resection and reconstruction procedures for pancreatic cancer must be based on evidence-based studies. However, the most important prognostic factor is the surgeon's experience, not only with regard to the post-operative course, but also survival. Specific teaching and training is thus essential."

CD012009,0,17387570,0,Pancreaticobronchial fistula associated with chronic pancreatitis: report of a case.,"We report a rare case of pancreaticobronchial fistula caused by chronic pancreatitis. A 46-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis was referred to us for investigation of dyspnea and bloody sputum. Chest radiography showed a bilateral pneumonia-like shadow, with severe atelectasis in the left lower lung field. Abdominal computed tomography showed a huge pancreatic pseudocyst in the left upper abdomen. The pseudocyst extended as a soft mass from the retroperitoneum into the posterior mediastinum with gas. The pancreatic amylase level in the sputum was 57,500 IU/l. The organism cultured from the sputum was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on these findings, we diagnosed a pancreaticobronchial fistula created by the infected pseudocyst penetrating directly through the dome of the diaphragm to the bronchial tree. External drainage of the infected pseudocyst improved the patient's respiratory condition, allowing him to undergo distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. Thereafter, he did not suffer any further symptoms."
CD012009,0,3110448,0,Effect of enteral nutrition on human pancreatic secretions.,"The influence on pancreatic secretion of four enteral feeding products was evaluated in a unique patient with an isolated duodenal fistula for whom enteral feeding access was obtained via a gastrostomy with a small Silastic catheter passed through the gastrostomy and through a surgically created gastrojejunostomy. The patient was totally supported by intravenous nutrition during the study. Each enteral feeding solution was administered at full strength at 50 ml/hr for 2 days with a 24-hr collection of pancreatic secretions by the duodenal cutaneous fistula taken on the second day. Infusion of the enteral feeding solutions did not alter volume of fistula drainage. All solutions decreased bicarbonate and amylase secretion but increased lipase and total nitrogen excretion. From this study, it would appear reasonable to administer Vivonex HN and Criticare HN via the jejunum in patients with pancreatic disease, whereas Osmolite would appear less satisfactory, due to its much stronger stimulation of lipase secretion."
CD012009,0,16927911,0,[Surgical management of acute pancreatitis. One hundred years of evolution].,"The aim of the paperwork is to present the evolution of surgical management of acute pancreatitis for a period of more than a century, by using the literature data that reveal the important moments in the knowledge of patho-etiology, in clarifying the definition and classification and, last but not least, in the progress of biological and image exploration, the right timing and the permanent development of surgical procedures so that the general mortality should decrease up to 10-15%, as it nowadays. The need for surgical intervention in acute pancreatitis is the controversy that appeared during this period. Until the mid of the 20th century, mainly on the basis of the clinic diagnosis, only the severe cases were recognized and became subjects of surgical exploration, with disastrous results. A great step forward was the dosage of urinary and serum amylase that allowed the non-surgical diagnosis of the disease, so that some patients could be treated successfully without surgery. Introduction of prognosis criteria by Ranson, the dosage of C-reactive protein together with CT scanning of the injury: interstitial - edematous or necrosis,the fine needle aspiration for bacteriology and the adoption of a definition and unitary classification resulted in a major change in therapy, in general, and in the surgical procedures. Necrosectomy combined with a drainage method, practised and developed by Beger since 1982, becomes a surgical dogma. Minimally invasive procedures became a reliable alternative to classic procedures due to the diversity and permanent development of laparoscopic, endoscopic and radiologic techniques."

CD012009,0,1373156,0,Assessment of value of pancreatic pseudocyst amylase concentration in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts by percutaneous evacuation.,The aim of our study was to determine the value of the percutaneous pancreatic pseudocyst evacuation. We assessed the relation between the amylase concentration of the pseudocyst contents and the final outcome of the disease treated by the percutaneous evacuation. Forty-three patients with a history of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocysts larger than 5 cm in diameter that persisted beyond 6 weeks were divided into four groups relative to the amylase concentration in the pseudocystic contents and the number of evacuations. The results show a good correlation between low amylase concentration in the liquid pseudocystic contents (less than or equal to 64 WU) and the healing rate after the percutaneous evacuation (p less than 0.001). The percutaneous evacuation of the pseudocysts failed in patients with increased amylase concentrations in the pseudocyst fluid regardless of the number of evacuations. We conclude that surgical treatment is indicated in patients who have amylase-rich pseudocyst contents.
CD012009,0,14254965,0,PANCREATIC DISEASE IN INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD. SURGICAL IMPLICATIONS.,"Surgeons whose practice involves many infants and children should be acquainted with all abnormalities of pancreatic malformation and function. Conditions amenable to surgical treatment are few, but serious. Trauma to the pancreas in childhood is most commonly diagnosed by fever, leukocytosis, rectus spasm and elevated serum amylase. Drainage of the lesser sac and debridement of devitalized tissue may prevent the sequelae of pseudocyst formation which seems to follow the untreated injury. True congenital cysts are characterized by an epithelial lining.Mucoviscidosis complicated by meconium ileus remains a challenging disease of the newborn that requires early operation. Ten per cent of infants with cystic fibrosis may be threatened by intestinal obstruction from this cause. Some children surviving the newborn period go on to develop obstruction later. Annular malformation of pancreas may produce upper intestinal (duodenal) obstructive symptoms immediately after birth. Surgical correction by duodenojejunostomy should be postponed only long enough to correct severe fluid or electrolyte imbalances. Idiopathic spontaneous hypoglycemia has the most serious prognosis if convulsions are allowed to recur. Increased metabolic rates in infants increase the need for control of blood sugar levels by either administration of cortisone or pancreatic resection. If adenoma is the cause, a conservative resection of the tumor suffices. If serial frozen section fails to reveal either tumor or hypertophy of insulin-producing cells, blind pancreatectomy may be indicated, for irreversible brain damage develops early in uncontrolled hypoglycemia."
CD012009,0,456226,0,Pancreatic duct arteriovenous fistula and the metastatic fat necrosis syndrome.,"This report summarizes the course of a patient with asymptomatic chronic pancreatitis associated with hemorrhage into the pancreatic duct and metastatic fat necrosis. Retrograde cannulation of the pancreatic duct and superior mesenteric arteriography established the presence of a pseudocyst with a pancreatic duct-arteriovenous (DAV) fistula as the cause of the syndrome. Ligation of feeder vessels with external drainage of the cyst as the initial surgical procedure stopped the bleeding but failed to prevent recurrence of the pancreatic duct-venous fistula. A pancreaticoduodenectomy with resection of the cyst and fistula was required to arrest destruction of distant tissues. Although serum and urine amylase concentrations were markedly elevated, serum lipase levels were normal throughout the patient's course. Elevation of serum lipase does not seem to be a necessary condition for the development of the metastatic fat necrosis syndrome."

Furthermore, the effect of intraluminal amylase on pancreatic secretion was studied. Reintroduction of pancreatic juice into the duodenum or infusion of trypsin into the duodenum depressed the volume of the pancreatic flow and the protein output markedly. Introduction of amylase into the duodenum did not significantly affect the pancreatic secretion. Thus, it seemed as it trypsin but not amylase was involved in the suppression exerted by pancreatic juice on exocrine pancreatic secretion in the pig."

Pancreatic exocrine secretion was significantly increased by 18.3% in the volume, 27.5% in the output of bicarbonate in humans and 8.9% in the volume, 26.1% in the output of amylase, 7.6% in the output of bicarbonate in dogs, by intravenous administration of the fat emulsion. The administration of the fat emulsion was followed by slight to minimal changes in blood sugar, amylase and IRI. The blood IRG level was significantly elevated but showed small fluctuations. The increase in pancreatic exocrine secretion induced by the fat emulsion was considered not to be mediated by intrinsic hormones but rather to be due to other humoral mechanisms."
CD012009,0,9697265,0,"A prospective analysis of the factors influencing pancreaticojejunostomy performed using a single method, in 100 consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomies.","The factors influencing the healing process of pancreaticojejunostomy (P-J) following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) are still ill defined, allowing the recommendation of various anastomotic methods. We conducted a prospective study to determine the risk factors influencing the protracted healing of P-J, examining 100 consecutive patients who underwent PD followed by P-J, performed as an end-to-side ""mucosa-to-mucosa"" anastomosis using vertical mattress sutures (VMS method). Protracted healing of P-J was classified as either peripancreatic sepsis (PPS), defined as prolonged suppurative discharge of less than 50 ml a day from the drain beneath the P-J for more than 1 week; or a pancreatic fistula (PF), defined as prolonged discharge of more than 50 ml a day with a high amylase content (> 1000 IU) for more than 1 week. There were 80 patients with a malignant neoplasm, and 20 with benign disease. The overall incidence of healing problems following P-J was 9%, which included 6 patients (6%) with PPS and 3 (3%) with PF. Apart from an advanced age of more than 70 years, none of the patients' characteristics or postoperative complications influenced the healing of P-J. The type of reconstruction, an anastomotic stent, the duct size, and a ""soft"" pancreas were not risk factors either. In conclusion, no factors, apart from the age or any special problem of an individual patient, influenced the dehiscence of P-J when the VMS method was used after PD."

CD012009,0,4073984,0,Timing of surgical drainage for pancreatic pseudocyst. Clinical and chemical criteria.,"Traditional concepts of managing pancreatic pseudocysts have changed with the advent of computerized tomography (CT) and ultrasound scanning, but new misconceptions related to spontaneous resolution have replaced some old ones. This report shows a difference in natural history and treatment requirements when pseudocysts are associated with acute versus chronic pancreatitis. There were 42 consecutive patients with pseudocysts treated over 5 years. Thirty-one were known alcoholics, two had gallstone pancreatitis, and nine had idiopathic pancreatitis. An attack of acute pancreatitis was identifiable within 2 months preceding in 22 patients, but there were only chronic symptoms in 20. Spontaneous resolution of the pseudocyst occurred in three patients (7%), all of whom had recent acute idiopathic pancreatitis, normal serum amylase levels, and pancreatograms showing normal pancreatic ducts freely communicating with the pseudocyst. Factors associated with failure to resolve included known chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic duct changes of chronic pancreatitis, persistence greater than 6 weeks, and thick walls (when seen) on scan. Nearly all (18/19) patients with known chronic pancreatitis had successful internal drainage of the pseudocysts immediately upon admission, whereas 6/20 patients with antecedent acute pancreatitis were found to require external drainage at the time surgery was eventually elected. Isoamylase analysis, performed on serum from 19 patients by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, detected the abnormal pancreatic isoamylase pattern described as ""old amylase"" in 15. When old amylase was present in the serum, internal drainage was always possible (14/14). In four of five patients whose serum contained no detectable old amylase, internal drainage was not possible regardless of the length of prior observation. There were four nonfatal complications arising from an acute pseudocyst during the wait for maturity. It is concluded that prolonged waiting is expensive and unnecessary for pseudocysts in chronic pancreatitis when there has been no recent acute attack. However, pseudocysts developing after identifiable acute pancreatitis should be observed in the safety of a hospital for up to 6 weeks to allow for either spontaneous resolution or maturation of the cyst wall. The appearance of old amylase in the serum suggests that the pseudocyst wall has achieved sufficient maturity to allow safe internal anastomosis."
CD012009,0,17786530,0,Pancreatojejunal leakage after pancreas head resection: anatomic and surgeon-related factors.,"Leakage of pancreatojejunostomies after pancreatic resections remains a challenge even at high volume centers. We here utilized a simple pancreas anatomy classification to study the effect of pancreatic anatomy on the development of pancreatic fistula after pancreas resection and pancreatojejunostomies. Also, the effect of surgical experience on the development of pancreatic fistulas was studied. Three hundred ninety-one patients undergoing pancreatic resections and reconstruction with a pancreatojejunostomy were studied. Closed suction drain was placed behind the anastomosis, and drainage fluid was collected postoperatively. A twofold increase over the serum amylase level was considered a fistula and was classified as described by the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula Definition. In 67 patients, the structural quality of the pancreatic parenchyma and the diameter of the pancreatic duct were classified as being <2 mm (2 points), between 2 and 5 mm (1 point), or >5 mm (0 points). The pancreatic parenchyma was assessed as being soft (2 points), intermediate (1 point), or hard (0 points). Pancreatic leakage as a function of surgeons' experience was also studied. Leakage was found in 25.1%, 8.9% being of type A, 10.2% being of type B, and 5.9% of type C. Pancreatic fistulas were only observed in patients with a score of 2 points or more. Age over 70 years, operations >6 h, and extended lymphadenectomy or surgeons experience were not associated with a higher leakage rate. In this study, leakage after pancreatojejunostomy was only associated with pancreatic anatomy, classified with a simple score. That score might improve comparability of studies on pancreatic leakage. Furthermore, drainage of pancreatic anastomosis might safely be omitted in patients with a low risk score for leakage."
CD012009,0,6176047,0,Zinc and magnesium output in pancreatic juice after pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"Determinations were made of the Zn and Mg contents of pancreatic juice in 12 cases undergoing external pancreatic duct drainage following pancreaticoduodenectomy in order to investigate the output and excretion pattern of trace elements in pancreatic juice and also to study their relations to pancreatic enzyme secretion and fibrosis of the pancreas. THe results indicate that the output of Zn in pancreatic juice ran parallel with amylase activity and was closely related to secretion of pancreatic enzymes. Relatively smaller variations were noted of the Mg content in pancreatic juice during the postoperative course, with the pattern of Mg excretion in pancreatic juice being dependent upon the volume of pancreatic juice secreted. The output of both Zn and Mg in pancreatic juice correlated with the volume of the residual pancreatic parenchyma. The amylase/Zn concentration ratio of pancreatic juice remained stationary postoperatively in all cases and was shown to have a negative correlation with the pancreatic parenchymal ratio. The findings suggest that the amylase/Zn concentration ratio can be a reliable indication of the degree of pancreatic fibrosis or of pancreatic exocrine function."
CD012009,0,6881731,0,Staple closure of the pancreas.,"Since modern surgical stapling instruments have found a wide range of usefulness in gastrointestinal surgery, we have attempted to establish the feasibility of staple rather than suture closure of the transected pancreas. Distal pancreatic resection has been performed in eight dogs utilizing the Auto Suture Model TA-55 surgical staple instrument for primary closure of the transected margin of the remaining pancreas. Serial serum amylase determinations for each of the animals remained within normal range. Each animal was sacrificed one week after the initial surgery with examination of the remaining pancreas. None of the animals demonstrated any evidence of pancreatic fistula or abscess. Similar technique for distal pancreatic resection has been utilized in 12 patients. Five of the resections were performed for malignancies, four for trauma, and three for benign pancreatic disease. In each case, the residual pancreas was closed with the TA-55 surgical staple instrument. Although two patients died during the postoperative period of causes unrelated to the pancreas, none developed either fistula or other evidence of difficulty in healing of the pancreas. It is our conclusion that staple closure of the transected margin of the pancreas is a reasonable and safe alternative to standard suture closure technique."

CD012009,0,17458602,0,Roux-en-Y drainage of the pancreatic stump decreases pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatic resection.,"Clinically relevant fistula after distal pancreatic resection occurs in 5-30% of patients, prolonging recovery and considerably increasing in-hospital stay and costs. We tested whether routine drainage of the pancreatic stump into a Roux-en-Y limb after distal pancreatic resection decreased the incidence of fistula. From October 2001, data of all patients undergoing pancreatic distal resection were entered in a prospective database. From June 2003 after resection, the main pancreatic duct and the pancreatic stump were oversewn, and in addition, anastomosed into a jejunal Roux-en-Y limb by a single-layer suture (n = 23). A drain was placed near the anastomosis, and all patients received octreotide for 5-7 days postoperatively. The volume of the drained fluid was registered daily, and concentration of amylase was measured and recorded every other day. Patient demographics, hospital stay, pancreatic fistula incidence (> or =30 ml amylase-rich fluid/day on/after postoperative day 10), perioperative morbidity, and follow-up after discharge were compared with our initial series of patients (treated October 2001-May 2003) who underwent oversewing only (n = 20). Indications, patient demographics, blood loss, and tolerance of an oral diet were similar. There were four (20%) pancreatic fistulas in the ""oversewn"" group and none in the anastomosis group (p < 0.05). Nonsurgical morbidity, in-hospital stay, and follow-up were comparable in both groups."

A 12 year-old-boy, with a previous history of abdominal pain, was admitted for acute cholangitis. Laboratory investigations showed cholestasis, cytolysis and eosinophilia. Serum amylase levels were normal. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan revealed a 100 mm hydatid cyst, located in the head of the pancreas. The biliary and pancreatic ducts were markedly dilated. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis. A pancreatic fistula was discovered. Subtotal excision of the cyst and external drainage of the pancreatic fistula were performed. Laboratory tests were normal post-operatively. The pancreatic fistulae persisted for two months. Hypercaloric and hyperprotidic feeding resulted in occlusion in three weeks. The rest of the postoperative course was uneventful and the size of the biliary and pancreatic ducts was normal. The authors discuss the diagnostic features of pancreatic hydatid cyst and discuss therapeutic modalities."

CD012009,0,10710251,0,Acute pancreatitis caused by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for bilateral renal pelvic calculi.,"An elderly woman with a history of cholecystectomy and a re-operation for postoperative peritonitis underwent extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for right and left renal pelvic calculi, 11 x 6 and 12 x 5 mm in size, to which 2400 and 1400 shots at 20 kV were given, respectively, on the same day. During the evening after the operation, the patient started to complain of upper abdominal pain. Laboratory examination on the next day revealed elevations in blood and urine amylase levels and a diagnosis of pancreatitis was made. Conservative treatment, including administration of protease inhibitor, did not improve her symptoms; abdominal distension became marked and she underwent laparotomy. Necrosection and indwelling of several drain tubes in abdomen were performed with an operative diagnosis of acute necrotic pancreatitis. With daily irrigation of drain tubes and treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphyloococcus aureus infection of the lungs and abdominal cavity, septicemia and duodenal fistula, the patient gradually recovered and was discharged on postoperative day 151. It was suggested that ESWL was responsible for the acute pancreatitis. Either an obstruction of the pancreatic duct by fragments of common duct stone, or mechanical injury of the pancreas due to adhesion between the pancreas and surrounding tissue caused by the lapalotomy, was considered as a possible cause of pancreatitis. To our knowledge, there has been no previous report of severe acute pancreatitis and the present case suggests that ESWL may cause severe pancreatic even in cases without stone shadow in the bile, common duct or pancreatic duct."

CD012009,0,20016434,0,Pancreatic injury.,"Injury to the pancreas, because of its retroperitoneal location, is a rare occurrence, most commonly seen with penetrating injuries (gun shot or stab wounds). Blunt trauma to the pancreas accounts for only 25% of the cases. Pancreatic injuries are associated with high morbidity and mortality due to accompanying vascular and duodenal injuries. Pancreatic injuries are not always easy to diagnose resulting in life threatening complications. Physical examination as well as serum amylase is not diagnostic following blunt trauma. Computed tomography (CT) scan can delineate the injury or transaction of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde pancreaticography (ERCP) is the main diagnostic modality for evaluation of the main pancreatic duct. Unrecognized ductal injury leads to pancreatic pseudocyst, fistula, abscess, and other complications. Management depends upon the severity of the pancreatic injury as well as associated injuries. Damage control surgery in hemodynamic unstable patients reduces morbidity and mortality."

Patients were included if a pancreatic mass or phlegmon followed an episode of pancreatitis, if the clinical impression was pancreatic abscess, and if drainage cultures were positive. Less than three Ranson's signs were present on admission in 72% of patients. The admission temperature was less than 38.3 degrees C in 71% of patients, and 27% of patients never had a fever. Abdominal tenderness was absent in 40% of patients. The admission amylase concentrations and white blood cell counts were normal in 36% and 23% of patients, respectively. Extensive débridement, external drainage, and a low threshold for reoperation were the mainstays of surgical therapy. Twenty patients (20%) died, but Ranson's signs did not predict outcome. pancreatic abscess may have an insidious presentation. A high index of suspicion, early computed tomographic scanning, and diagnostic needle aspiration may be necessary to establish this diagnosis."

CD012009,0,458537,0,The unusual presentation of pancreatitis in infancy.,"Two infants with acute pancreatitis are described. It appears that acute pancreatitis in infancy presents in one of two ways: part of a severe generalized illness, or as ascites. The outlook for the former depends on the prognosis of the generalized illness. If pancreatitis can be recognized as the cause of the ascites, then adequate treatment will result in survival. Although the cause in some infants is said to be idiopathic, exploration should be performed, the lesser sac investigated and if the child is in reasonable condition, appropriate study of the biliary tree and pancreatic ductile system should be considered. If a pseudocyst is present, adequate drainage is mandatory. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment will be possible only if this rare disorder is suspected.

CD012009,0,3292032,0,Management of general surgical problems after cardiac transplantation.,"Over a 6-year period at the University Hospital in London, Ont., 101 patients underwent heart transplantation and 5 heart-lung transplantation. The authors review the general surgical problems identified from the charts of 13 of these patients. In the early postoperative period (within 30 days), laparotomy was required for pancreatitis (one), perforated peptic ulcer (two), cholecystectomy (one), pancreatic cyst (one) and appendicitis (one). In addition, a spontaneous colocutaneous fistula and spontaneous pneumoperitoneum occurred; both were managed conservatively. Later, three patients required cholecystectomy; one underwent a below-knee and a Symes amputation for dry gangrene and one surgical correction of a lymphocele. The incidence of surgical problems (13%) indicates an increased susceptibility in this group of patients. Four of the 13 patients died. Pancreatitis is a well-recognized complication of cardiac surgery; it is frequently associated with a normal or only slightly elevated serum amylase level, making a definitive diagnosis without laparotomy almost impossible. Persistence of abdominal signs should signal the need for exploratory surgery. During the early postoperative period and in the absence of multiorgan failure, immediate operation for an acute abdomen is usually successful. Despite the additional risk, cardiac transplantation does not preclude later surgery, but immunosuppression must be continued and carefully monitored."
CD012009,0,8981502,0,Common biliary-pancreatic conduit stenosis induces pancreobiliary reflux.,"A striking pancreatic juice reflux toward the biliary tree (PR) has frequently been found in subjects with common bile-pancreatic conduit (CBPC) and gallstone-induced acute pancreatitis (SAP). Our aim was to determine the role of the CBPC functional diameter as a potential trigger of PR. The CBPC was calibrated in three groups of patients: (A) patients with gallbladder stones using intraoperative direct cholangiometry (n = 24), (B) patients after surgical removal of common bile duct stones using postoperative cholangiometry via T-drain (n = 6), and (C) patients with SAP using the same procedures as in group B (n = 6). In all patients in groups B and C, aliquots of bile were collected and assayed for pancreatic amylase content. The mean functional diameter of the CBPC varied from 0.80 mm in patients in groups A and B to 0.47 mm in group C (p < 0.001). The bile samples of group B contained low concentrations of amylase, whereas high values could be found in all samples of group C. We conclude that PR is a frequent event occurring after bile duct revision concerning small amounts of pancreatic juice. However, CBPC functional stenosis as seen in patients with SAP obviously induces PR with high amounts of pancreatic juice."

The etiology of these injuries was gunshot wound in 15 patients; stab wound in 1 patient; and a motor vehicle accident in 1 patient. Seven patients presented in shock with a systolic blood pressure of less than 80. At exploration, 57 associated injuries were found in the 17 patients including 16 major vascular injuries. All patients were treated with pyloric exclusion and drainage. Vagotomy was performed in eight patients. None of these 17 patients were felt to have extensive enough damage to require pancreatico-duodenectomy. Two patients died in the immediate postoperative period of severe coagulopathy and two patients died of sepsis. Seven patients had complications related to the pancreatico-duodenal injury. All seven developed pancreatic fistulas; three also had pancreatitis and two developed multiple enterocutaneous fistulas. Systemic complications included pulmonary complications in eight patients and sepsis in five patients, including two patients with abdominal abscesses. Six patients bled in the immediate postoperative period secondary to coagulopathy. Three patients had complications related to pyloric exclusion. One developed afferent loop syndrome necessitating reoperation. The other two had marginal ulcers, which either perforated or bled and required reoperation. Of interest, neither of these two patients had vagotomy initially. The results of this series confirm the effectiveness of pyloric exclusion with vagotomy for severe pancreatico-duodenal injury."

CD012009,0,9658996,0,[Chronic pleural effusion from the pancreas].,"Chronic, pleural effusion, characterized by a very high pancreatic enzymes activity is a rare complication of the pancreatic diseases. It is pathognomonic for the pancreaticopleural fistula, arising most frequently in the patients with chronic, alcoholic pancreatitis. Clinical manifestations of the chronic pleural effusion lead the physician's attention to the pulmonary diseases, what often is the cause of misdiagnosis. The diagnostics of this pancreatic diseases complication bases on the effusion's pancreatic enzymes activity evaluation and visual methods such as computed tomography, ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Management can be started conservatively, but if the result is not adequate, surgical treatment is needed. As the cases of pancreatic, chronic pleural effusion may be commoner than it is reported, author postulates a routine evaluation of the pleural effusion alpha-amylase activity in each case of the unclear pleural effusion."

In 22 patients the fistula was into the peritoneal cavity and they presented with pancreatic ascits. In 7 patients the fistula tracked up through the mediastinum into a pleural cavity, and they presented with pancreatic pleural effusions. Five patients presented with both pancreatic ascites and pancreatic pleural effusions. Diagnosis was made by finding a markedly elevated amylase and protein content in the ascitic and pleural fluids. Serum amylase was usually, but not always, elevated. Over one half of the patients had no history of inflammatory pancreatic disease. Initial treatment was non-operative using nasogastric suction, diamox, atropine, and multiple paracenteses or thoracenteses. This was successful in 48% (12/25). If non-operative therapy failed, surgery was performed to drain or resect the internal fistula. Surgery was successful in 82% (14/17). The internal pancreatic fistula was successfully demontrated in most instances by preoperative, operative, or postmortem pancreatography, or by gross observation at the time of surgery."

CD012009,0,3554575,0,Percutaneous aspiration of peripancreatic fluid collections: a safe method to detect infection.,"During the past 5 years, we have used percutaneous aspiration of peripancreatic fluid collections guided by computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography (US) to facilitate diagnosis of infection in selected cases. Fifteen of 18 patients undergoing guided needle aspiration had persistent fevers (greater than 38.3 degrees C). The three afebrile patients all had abdominal pain and leukocytosis, and two of the three also had elevated serum amylase levels. Percutaneous aspiration was guided by CT in 14 patients and by US in four. On the basis of aspirate Gram stains and cultures, as well as surgical (15) and percutaneous drainage (1) findings, the final diagnosis was pancreatic abscess in nine patients, infected pseudocyst in four, uninfected pseudocyst in four, and cystadenoma in one. Diagnosis based on percutaneous aspiration was correct in 17 of 18 patients (94%), and no complications could be directly attributed to the procedure. We conclude that CT- or US-guided percutaneous aspiration is a safe and accurate diagnostic procedure for patients with peripancreatic fluid collections in whom secondary infection is suspected."

Skeletonization of the splenic artery and vein is associated with longer operative times and greater potential for bleeding. The authors report their experience with splenic preservation during laparoscopic pancreatic resection using ligation of the splenic vessels and preservation of the short gastric vessels."
CD012009,0,7517648,0,The clinical challenge of multiple pancreatic pseudocysts.,"To evaluate the frequency of multiple pancreatic cysts, the likelihood of preoperative diagnosis, and therapeutic outcome, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 157 patients who underwent operation for pancreatic pseudocysts at 2 institutions between 1970 and 1992. Multiple pseudocysts were found in 29 (18.5%). The 8 women and 21 men ranged in age from 21 to 79 years. The etiology was alcohol abuse in 15 (52%), biliary tract disease in 6 (21%), alcohol abuse and biliary tract disease in 3 (10%), and a variety of other causes in the remaining 5 (17%). There was no difference in age, sex, race, etiology, or presenting signs and symptoms between patients with single pseudocysts and those with multiple cysts. Serum amylase levels were significantly higher in patients with multiple cysts compared to those with single cysts (P < 0.05). Computed tomography accurately demonstrated the extent of disease in 20 of 25 patients (80%), while 1 or more cysts were missed in 5 (20%). The mean number of cysts per patient was 2.7, with a range of 2 to 5. Average pseudocyst diameter was 7.8 cm, with a range from 3 to 20 cm. Multiple internal drainage procedures were performed in 19 patients, a combination of internal and external drainage in 6, external drainage in 1, and resection of multiple cysts in the tail in 2. There was no operative mortality. With a mean follow up of 38.5 months, only 1 recurrent pseudocyst has been found. There were six attempts at percutaneous drainage in six patients. Two of these patients were referred to our institution following failure of percutaneous drainage at other hospitals. Three other patients had residual symptomatic pseudocysts following percutaneous drainage at our hospitals and then underwent multiple internal drainage. The sixth patient refused operative drainage despite the persistence of residual symptomatic pseudocysts after attempted percutaneous drainage. The incidence of multiple pseudocysts (18.5%) is higher than previously reported. There is no difference in the clinical features of patients with single versus multiple pseudocysts. Patients with multiple cysts have higher serum amylase levels. Preoperative computed tomography underestimated the number of cysts in 20% of patients. Careful intraoperative exploration is still needed to avoid missing multiple pseudocysts. Internal drainage is the preferred therapy. A thorough search for multiple cysts at the initial operation should eliminate one potential cause for pseudocyst recurrence."

We developed a new surgical technique, transduodenal pancreatic juice drainage, for preventing postoperative pancreatic fistula. The procedure involves a transduodenal approach. A pancreatic stent was inserted into the main pancreatic duct from the papilla of Vater to its the distal side, and continuous suction drainage was performed. The pancreatic parenchyma was divided using a knife, and the main pancreatic duct was ligated. The cut surface of the remaining pancreas was closed by hand suturing. This procedure was performed on 10 patients, and none of them developed clinical postoperative pancreatic fistula. We consider our transduodenal pancreatic juice drainage technique to be an effective procedure for preventing postoperative pancreatic fistula in patients who have undergone distal pancreatectomy."

However, bladder drainage is associated with a higher risk of infection and metabolic complications, necessitating enteric conversion in about one third of patients.

CD012009,0,1384249,0,[Endoscopic-sonographic control of cystogastric catheter drainage of pancreatogenic fluid collections].,"In 1985, Hancke published a report on cystogastrostomy using a double pigtail catheter as an alternative to surgical drainage of pseudocysts. Between 1986 and 1991, with the aim of testing the technique, we carried out a prospective study in 39 patients with 40 pancreatic collections of fluid. The object of the study was to identify those collections of fluid that would be suitable for cystogastric drainage. Among the first 20 patients thus treated, permanent evacuation of the cyst was achieved in eleven. In the other nine patients, the reasons for the failure of cystogastric drainage included to immature a cyst, too small a cyst, prior cyst infection and status after a BII resection. For the patients No. 21 to 40, these conditions were adopted as exclusion criteria, with the result that we were able to increase the percentage of permanent emptying to 75%. This makes cystogastric drainage a genuine alternative to surgical and other drainage procedures. As a minimally invasive intervention, it is a first choice therapeutic procedure in suitable pancreatic pseudocysts. If cystogastric drainage is shown not to be feasible, the possibility of employing percutaneous drainage should be investigated. Surgical drainage procedures are reserved for use in such cases as cannot be treated with catheter drainage."
CD012009,0,7508109,0,Pancreatic protein hypersecretion and elevated plasma CCK: prerequisites for increased pancreatic growth?,"This study was undertaken to establish if a correlation exists between chronic elevated pancreatic secretion and growth of the pancreas. Rats provided with jugular, pancreatic, biliary, duodenal, or ileal cannulas were fed throughout the experiment with a liquid diet continuously infused into the duodenum. Four days after surgery, control rats and those infused with cerulein (CE) 0.45 microgram/kg/h had their pancreatic juice returned into the duodenum. Two other groups had their pancreatic juice either totally diverted outside (DO) or returned into the ileum (DI). In all groups, bile was returned into the duodenum. Pancreatic juice was collected every 4 h for 4 days with volume and protein determined. After 4 days, rats were killed and their pancreata were evaluated for weight and contents of DNA, RNA, protein, amylase, and chymotrypsinogen. The average volumes/4 h were significantly increased by 259, 241, and 270% in DO, DI, and CE rats, respectively. Protein output remained at control levels in DO rats, whereas increases of 200 and 90% above control values were observed in DI and CE rats, respectively, during the last periods of collection. Constant drainage of pancreatic juice outside (DO) had no effect on pancreatic growth; on the contrary, its reinfusion into the ileum and constant cerulein infusion were associated with impressive growth of the pancreas, with cerulein being the most potent stimulus. In conclusion these data support the hypothesis that increased protein output is associated with pancreatic growth, a phenomenon mediated by endogenous cholecystokinin."
CD012009,0,25398924,0,Spontaneous choledochal cyst perforation in pregnancy with co-existent chronic pancreatitis.,"Choledochal cysts are a congenital disorder of the bile duct, usually presenting in childhood. As they cause weakening of the wall of the bile duct, any distal obstruction, infection or reflux of amylase-rich fluid in the biliary tract can predispose to spontaneous perforation. A 25-year-old pregnant woman at 35 weeks of gestation presented with acute abdominal and fetal distress. On emergency laparotomy, common bile duct perforations were detected. T-tube drainage and caesarean section were performed. A t-tube cholangiogram revealed the diagnosis of a choledochal cyst with an abnormal pancreatobiliary junction and chronic pancreatitis. The patient later underwent cyst excision with Roux en Y hepaticojejunostomy. Spontaneous choledochal cyst perforation in pregnancy can be successfully managed by a two-stage operation."
CD012009,0,27008166,0,Complications of pancreato-duodenectomy.,"Pancreato-duodenectomy (PD) is the procedure of choice for management of resectable periampullary and pancreatic cancers and some patients with chronic pancreatitis. PD is one of the most major GI/ HPB surgical procedures performed involving resection of multiple organs and reconstruction with multiple anastomoses. While mortality of PD has been brought down to less than 5% morbidity still remains high.Patients undergoing PD are usually elderly with comorbidities - general complications of a major operation e.g. wound, chest, cardiac and venous thrombo-embolism, are common.The major intra-operative morbidity of PD is bleeding which can be from multiple sites viz. gall bladder bed, choledochal veins, gastro-colic trunk, pancreato-duodenal veins, jejunal veins, uncinate veins and cut surface of pancreas. An aberrant right hepatic artery (from the superior mesenteric artery) can be injured while dissecting the common bile duct.Pancreatic leak is defined as presence of amylase rich (>3x serum amylase) fluid in drain beyond 3 days. It is graded as A (no clinical impact), B (persists, infected) or C (systemic sepsis, reoperation). Investigation of choice is computed tomography; a localized collection can be drained percutaneously. Major leak requires reexploration at which lavage and drainage should be performed; no attempt should be made to repair or redo the anastomosis. Soft pancreas and undilated duct are the two most important risk factors for pancreatic anastomotic leak; role of octreotide to prevent the leak is debatable. Preoperative biliary drainage in the form of endoscopic stenting may reduce bleeding complications by controlling coagulopathy but increases the risk of infective complications.Postoperative bleed can be early or delayed and intra-luminal or intra-abdominal. Early intra-abdominal bleed is surgical - either a slipped ligature e.g. of the gastro-duodenal artery or one of the veins or from the pancreato-duodenal bed; reexploration should be done to control it if it is severe. Early intra-luminal bleed is from one of the anastomoses - commonest being the pancreatic. UGIE rules out bleed from the gastro/duodenal anastomosis (which if present, can be controlled endoscopically). Control of pancreatic stump bleed requires reoperation - taking down anterior layer of the anastomosis or a jejunotomy. Delayed intra-abdominal bleed is from a pseudo-aneurysm of an artery, usually gastro-duodenal caused by erosion by an abscess secondary to a leak; treatment of choice is angio-embolization. Delayed intra-luminal bleed is because of stress ulcers caused by systemic sepsis usually secondary to a leak and intra-abdominal sepsis.Other common complications include delayed gastric emptying and acute pancreatitis.Reoperations after PD are frequent - commonest cause is bleed, followed by leak; mortality of reexploration is high. Long term complications include anastomotic (PJ/ HJ) stricture, endocrine and exocrine insufficiency and inability to regain weight and poor quality of life."

Thoracentesis revealed sterile bloody fluid with markedly elevated amylase activity of 5,770 IU/l (pancreatic isozyme, 100%) and no malignant cells. From these examinations, a diagnosis of chronic alcohol-related pancreatitis accompanied by mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst and pancreatic pleural effusion was made. We employed conservative therapy including chest tube drainage followed by operation (main pancreatic duct jejunal side-to-side anastomosis). The clinical course has been uneventful for more than 1 year after discharge."

CD012009,0,8235437,0,Cholesterol nucleation time measurement in nasobiliary or nasoduodenal bile. Comparison with surgical bile.,"The usual technique of collecting gallbladder bile at laparotomy is not suitable for sequential studies of cholesterol nucleation time (NT) in patients receiving therapy to prevent or dissolve cholesterol gallstones. Our aim was to study the feasibility of measuring NT in bile obtained by nasobiliary or nasoduodenal intubation. We studied a total of 10 cholesterol gallstone patients; in 8 bile was collected by nasobiliary drainage, in 7 it was collected by nasoduodenal intubation, and in 3 it was collected at laparotomy the next day. Three patients developed abdominal pain and increased serum amylase after endoscopic retrograde cannulation. All three biles obtained at operation nucleated quickly (NT, 1-4 days), whereas duodenal biles were all beyond the expected range (NT, > 21 days). Chymotrypsin activity, as a marker of pancreatic juice contamination, was detected in five of eight nasobiliary biles and in all seven duodenal biles but in none of the surgical biles. Free fatty acids (reflecting lipolysis) were significantly higher in duodenal than in surgical biles, with nasobiliary bile showing intermediate values. Nasobiliary bile showed either a rapid (median NT, 3 days) or a slow (median NT, 22 days) NT, depending on whether chymotrypsin activity was absent or present (p < 0.05). We conclude that duodenal bile is never suitable for NT determination because of contamination by pancreatic enzymes, and that nasobiliary bile, if not contaminated by pancreatic enzymes, may be suitable for NT determination but that its collection via a nasobiliary tube after cholecystokinin injection carries a risk of pancreatitis."
CD012009,0,2466917,0,Failure of somatostatin or an analog to promote closure of end pancreatic fistulae.,"Somatostatin has been reported to promote closure of pancreatic fistulae, but use of the analog SMS 201-995 (Sandoz, Inc.) has not previously been published. We used this analog to treat two patients with end pancreatic fistulae refractory to conventional therapy. One patient had disruption of a pancreaticojejunostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy and the other had acute necrotizing gallstone pancreatitis and disruption of the pancreatic duct in the tail. SMS 201-995 (100-150 micrograms/d) abruptly decreased fistula output by 50% in both patients but further increases in dosage had no further effect on output. Neither fistula healed after 3-4 wk of therapy. Treatment with somatostatin or its analogs alone will not lead to closure of a pancreatic fistula complicated by factors such as distal obstruction, infection, or foreign body. Somatostatin may promote closure of lateral fistulae and may simplify the management of patients with high output fistulae."

CD012009,0,12466745,0,EUS-guided pancreatic pseudocyst drainage: review and experience at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.,"Pancreatic pseudocyst, the most common cystic lesion of the pancreas, is a localized collection of fluid rich in amylase within or adjacent to the pancreas and enclosed by a nonepithelialized wall, occurring as a result of acute or chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, or pancreatic duct obstruction. Currently, at least 3 major forms of therapy are available: percutaneous drainage, surgical intervention, and endoscopic drainage. Controversy exists concerning which of these techniques should be offered to the patient as initial therapy. Three options exist for the surgical management of pancreatic pseudocysts: excision, external drainage, and internal drainage. Surgery, which traditionally was the major treatment approach for pancreatic pseudocysts, has been challenged by newer endoscopic techniques. Given the low complication and mortality rates and the high success rate of endoscopic drainage when compared with surgery, surgical intervention should be reserved only for certain cases. Addition of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for endoscopic drainage is a new and exciting development and may decrease the risks associated with endoscopic drainage. We report our experience of 14 cases of EUS-guided pancreatic pseudocyst drainage and review the literature for advantages and disadvantages of these pancreatic pseudocyst drainage procedures.

In general, these fistulas have a good prognosis; however, delay in finding the correct diagnosis influences the prognosis. This is often due to unfamiliarity with the disease and the non-specific presentation of patients with pleural effusion. The initial presentation usually comprises respiratory (dyspnoea, coughing due to pleural effusion) and occasional abdominal symptoms (epigastric pain). A definitive diagnosis is made when elevated pleural effusion amylase levels are demonstrated. Surgical treatment is only indicated if conservative or endoscopic treatment fails, and consists of resection of the fistula and drainage of the pancreatic duct via a lateral pancreaticojejunostomy or resection of the part of the pancreas where the fistula originates. In the first patient, surgical drainage of the fluid accumulation was applied, but she died of aspiration pneumonia after she had removed the feeding tube and had refused further treatment.

The entity is classified into 4 different types according to the anatomy of the malformation, which effects or not the intrahepatic biliary tree. The authors review theirs experience with 16 consecutive patients with choledochal cyst operated between 1971 and 1985. In 12 children (mean age: 5,8 years, 11 girls) without previous surgery, preoperative diagnosis was made with abdominal ultrasonography and, in some cases, endoscopic retrograde cholangio-wirsungography. Peroperative cholangiography demonstrated a common pancreatico-biliary channel associated with high choledochal amylase content in 6 cases. Surgical treatment consisted in cyst excision with hepatico-jejunostomy in those 12 patients. We also discuss the surgical treatment of 4 previously operated patients with postoperative cholangitis or biliary carcinoma. An anomalous pancreatico-biliary ductal junction (long common channel allowing free pancreatico-biliary reflux) is usually observed in these patients; it is considered to play a role in the etiology of congenital choledochal cysts.

We report our diagnostic observations and therapeutic experiences in non-operative and surgical management. A review on the pertinent literature is given. Acute pancreatitis frequently (10-20%) occurs in conjunction with small left-sided pleural effusions. These effusions usually undergo spontaneous regression. Their genesis is explained by vascular transdiaphragmatic inflammatory involvement of the pleural space. In patients with alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis pleural effusion is, however, a rare event. The activity of the pancreas-specific enzymes (amylase, lipase) are extremely high. The most likely underlying pathogenetic mechanism is transdiaphragmatic lymphatic transfer of pancreatic secretions to the subpleural space. A rare cause is the formation of a pancreatico-pleural fistula. The use of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) can reveal the site of pancreatic fistulas to the pleural cavity."

Six patients had injuries of the pancreatic body, necessitating distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy in four cases. Two patients with contusion of the pancreatic tail were treated by drainage, followed by development of an infected pancreatic pseudocyst in one case. Six patients died (43%). It is concluded that complete inspection of the pancreas and peripancreatic hematoma is mandatory in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic injuries."

CD012009,0,1411884,0,Long term results of percutaneous catheter drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts.,"Percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) has become an established and often preferred alternative to surgical treatment in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts. However, the long term results of percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts remain uncertain. In an effort to determine the long term outcome of this therapy, 42 patients undergoing PCD of a pancreatic pseudocyst were analyzed retrospectively. Forty-two pancreatic pseudocysts were drained percutaneously in 42 patients. Sixty-seven percutaneous drainage procedures were performed--22 patients underwent one, 15 had two and five patients required three procedures. Percutaneous drainage was considered not to be effective when the pseudocyst persisted or when it recurred after initial resolution. Twenty-three pseudocysts were infected at the time of drainage and 19 were not infected. In 30 patients, the cause of the pseudocyst was alcoholic pancreatitis. There were no deaths related to the procedures and seven complications occurred, including hemorrhage, pancreatic fistula and empyema. Mean follow-up evaluation time of the patients was ten months. In nine patients, the pseudocyst was successfully drained and resolved. There were 33 treatment failures, among which 26 pseudocysts failed to resolve and seven recurred after initial resolution. Eventually, 25 patients underwent a surgical procedure, 20 for persistent pseudocyst and five for recurrence. Using contingency table analysis, the size of the pseudocyst, amount of fluid drained, amylase concentration in the aspirate, presence of infection, number of drainage procedures performed and duration of catheter drainage had no influence on the likelihood of success in long term pseudocyst resolution after PCD. Pseudocysts not related to alcoholic pancreatitis seemed to be less likely (p < 0.05) to resolve with percutaneous drainage than those caused by alcohol. PCD is a safe and valuable procedure in the acute management of patients with pancreatic pseudocyst. However, the current data suggest that despite early success with percutaneous drainage, the lack of resolution and recurrence rate of pancreatic pseudocyst is high. Therefore, it should not be considered as the definitive form of therapy in most patients. Close surveillance of patients undergoing percutaneous drainage and communication between surgeons and radiologists are critical in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts."

Initial therapy was conservative, consisting of gastrointestinal rest, serosal apposition with paracentesis or thoracentesis, with or without the administration of anti-secretagogues. This therapy was successful in 21 of 42 patients, but 5 deaths occurred. Operative therapy was performed in 24 patients. There was one surgical failure and two deaths early in the experience. Ten of our final 16 patients underwent liver biopsy, and all 10 were found to have cirrhosis. All patients, even those with documented cirrhosis, should have routine amylase and albumin determinations on ascitic or pleural fluid. Internal pancreatic fistulae should be treated initially nonoperatively; if this is ineffective, operative therapy has an acceptably low morbidity and mortality."

Computed tomography or ultrasound-guided aspiration or percutaneous pancreatic ductography enabled specific diagnoses in 43 of 45 patients (96%). In almost half the patients, diagnostic aspiration with 22-gauge needles was unsuccessful due to viscous contents or firm cavity walls. Single-step needle aspiration of noninfected pseudocysts was successful in only three of ten patients (30%). Catheter drainage cured six of seven noninfected pseudocysts (85.7%) and seven of nine infected pseudocysts (77.7%). Pancreatic phlegmons were aspirated in five patients to exclude secondary infection and help determine the need for surgery. Pancreatic abscesses were drained successfully in nine of 13 patients (69.2%); temporizing benefit was achieved in the other four who eventually underwent surgery in improved condition. Early diagnosis of the complications of pancreatitis may be established almost uniformly, and at least 70% of patients with infected or noninfected pseudocysts and pancreatic abscesses may be cured by nonoperative drainage."
CD012009,0,1093266,0,Pancreatic pseudocysts.,"Pseudocysts are fascinating lesions of the pancreas which present as upper abdominal masses in about 80 per cent of cases, but also as obstructive jaundice, intrasplenic and intra-left-renal masses, mediastinal masses, flank abscess, pleural effusions, and ascites rich in amylase. They are diagnosed by urine amylase with greater sensitivity than by serum amylase. Cysts must be differentiated from pancreatic abscesses, indolent phlegmonous pancreatitis, cystadenomas, and carcinomas of the pancreas, as well as lymphomas and other rare tumors. They may be satisfactorily treated by large sump tube drains to the outside but about one third will require a further operation. Internal drainage by cystogastrostomy is the simplest and best current procedure, but not applicable to all cases. A good alternative is Roux-en-y cyst-jejunostomy. Caution is needed in the preoperative workup since all procedures are accompanied by an operative mortality approaching 10 per cent, mostly due to hepatic disease, portal hypertension, stress ulcerations, and hemorrhage. The follow-up shows 85 per cent good results from proper drainage but 40 per cent are diabetics and in many patients the ravages of alcoholism continue unabated."

Nineteen combined isografts were performed using this technique in inbred male Lewis (RT1:I) rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Six recipients died within 1 month from early complications (two from uremia, two from pancreatitis, one from bleeding, one from peritonitis); the other 13 survived more than 1 month after transplantation with both the pancreas and kidney grafts functioning. Four of the 13 rats died after 1 month (one from uremia secondary to an obstructed ureter, one from unexplained uremia, one from peritonitis after a biopsy, and one of unknown causes). The pancreas isografts of two animals were excised at 1 and 3 months to confirm dependence on the graft; both animals became hyperglycemic after graft pancreatectomy and had immediate declines of urine amylase activity to normal. One animal was sacrificed at 3 months to determine the insulin content of its native and transplanted pancreas; insulin was very low in the former and normal in the latter. The remaining rats survived with both grafts functioning for at least 6 months (normoglycemic, high urinary amylase levels, normal or near-normal plasma creatinine concentrations), before being sacrificed within the context of other experiments and for histological observations. Both the kidney and pancreas isografts were well preserved microscopically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD012009,0,1709346,0,[Non-surgical treatment of cysts and pseudocysts of the pancreas. A study of a series of 33 cases].,"Pancreatic cysts and pseudocysts had to be treated by surgery until 15 years ago. Nowadays they can be aspirated (or drained) either endoscopically or by ultrasonic and computed tomographic guided punctures. The aim of this study was to see if these non-surgical treatments were efficient enough among the actual treatments. From 1984 to 1988, 33 patients were admitted in one single institution with a pancreatic cyst or pseudocyst, 22 of which were a consequence on an acute pancreatitis and 11 complicated a chronic pancreatitis. Ten cysts were connected with the Wirsung channel while 11 others were not, but the ERCP failed to give any accurate information on this point in 12 cases. As a first treatment, we abstained of any invasive procedure in 9 cases, 18 were treated by percutaneous aspiration guided by ultrasound and 6 patients underwent surgery. The mean follow-up was 30 months. All the patients who had no treatment remained symptom free; their cysts improved in 5 cases and disappeared in 4 cases. Among the cysts treated by percutaneous aspiration, 4 had to be operated, 5 disappeared, 3 improved and 6 recurred; the percutaneous aspiration obtained a lasting symptoms' relief for these patients, whatever the connection the cyst had with the Wirsung channel. This study suggests that percutaneous aspiration or drainage guided by ultrasound may be a treatment of the highest quality for acute and chronic pancreatitis cystic formations. However, it seems to act upon the symptoms rather than upon the cystic formations themselves."

CD012009,0,6864832,0,Traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts.,"At the Martin Luther King, Jr, General Hospital in Los Angeles, during the period from June 1972 to April 1981, seven patients underwent surgery for traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts. The overall average age was 28 and the average hospital stay was 31 days. Ultrasound was the most useful test for diagnosis and follow-up. Preoperatively, serum amylases were not consistently elevated. Overall recurrences and complications totaled 57 percent. There were no deaths. The authors consider a large cystogastrostomy the treatment of choice for mature cysts that are satisfactorily adherent to the stomach. The second preference is a Roux-en-Y cystojejunostomy. External drainage was employed for acute cysts that required drainage. A distal pancreatectomy was performed for patients with small pancreatic tail pseudocysts. Patients who underwent acute drainage were usually drained externally and had a poorer outcome than patients who were operated on later with internal drainage. When compared with another group of 15 alcoholic patients who were operated on for pancreatic pseudocysts, patients with traumatic pseudocysts had a poorer outcome."
CD012009,0,7616475,0,Therapeutic strategies for pancreatic pseudocysts.,"During the last 15 years, a total of 26 patients were treated for pancreatic pseudocysts, at the 2nd Department of Propaedeutic Surgery, University of Athens. There were 16 (61.5%) men and 10 (38.5%) women aged between 19 and 82 years old (mean age 61 years). Dominating symptoms in most patients were epigastric mass and pain, nausea, vomiting, mild fever and leucocytosis, and persistent elevation of serum amylase. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound, CT scan, and ERCP, were mostly helpful in establishing diagnosis. In most cases, attack of acute pancreatitis preceded with the exception of two cases where there was chronic pancreatitis and another which was post-traumatic. Rapid progression of underlying pancreatitis led to urgent laparotomy in two patients (7.7%). Elective surgery was performed in 22 patients (84.6%), 1-7 months after onset of pancreatitis (median 2 months). Selection of operative procedure depended on the patient and cyst condition. Cystogastrostomy was performed in 18 patients (69.2%), cystojejunostomy in three patients (11.5%), and external drainage in three patients (11.5%). There were three postoperative deaths (11.5%). Haemorrhage and infection were the main complications. Percutaneous drainage was performed in two cases (7.7%) (one for a cyst remnant after an operative procedure), and medical treatment with somatostatin in another case (3.8%) with excellent clinical results. In conclusion, conservative treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts has good clinical results, but it is not always indicated. Surgical drainage remains the preferred method of treatment."
CD012009,0,19400483,0,Critical care of the patient with acute pancreatitis.,"Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory process of the pancreas with variable involvement of regional tissues and remote organs. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the aetiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy of acute pancreatitis relevant to the intensivist. Recent international guidelines on the management of acute pancreatitis are summarised. Eighty percent of acute pancreatitis episodes are related either to gallstones or to alcohol abuse. Independent of its aetiology, the pathophysiologic hallmark of acute pancreatitis is the premature activation of trypsin, which leads to massive pancreas inflammation, systemic overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators and ultimately remote organ dysfunction. All guidelines agree that the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should include clinical symptoms, increased serum amylase or lipase levels and/or characteristic findings on computed tomography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is recommended as a causative therapy in patients with acute cholangitis or a strong suspicion of gallstones. All guidelines underline the importance of vigorous fluid resuscitation and supplemental oxygen therapy and prefer enteral over parenteral nutrition, with the majority favouring the nasojejunal route. In view of lacking scientific evidence, antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infection of pancreatic necroses is discouraged by most guidelines. Computed tomography-guided fine needle aspiration is the technique of choice to differentiate between sterile and infected pancreas necrosis. While sterile pancreatic necrosis should be managed conservatively, infected pancreatic necrosis requires debridement and drainage supplemented by antibiotic therapy. Surgical necrosectomy is the traditional approach, but less invasive techniques (retroperitoneal or laparoscopic necrosectomy, computed tomography-guided percutaneous catheter drainage) may be equally effective."
CD012009,0,11996073,0,Is there any benefit of preservation of the spleen in distal pancreatectomy?,"For a pancreatic body or tail tumor, distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy (DPS) is a standard operation. Spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (SPDP) was introduced in order to preserve the organ and thus provide the patient with a better quality of life. Clinical data were compared between 38 Japanese patients with DPS and 9 with SPDP for benign tumors or tumor-like lesions at the body or tail of the pancreas at preoperative, early postoperative (< 3 months after operation), and late postoperative periods (>6 months after operation). The preoperative findings were not different between the two groups except for the significantly higher serum amylase levels in the SPDP group. Operation time, operative blood loss, and length of postoperative hospital stay were not different between the two groups. Pancreatic fistula occurred in 3 (8%) of the 38 patients in the DPS group and in 1 (11%) of the 9 patients in the SPDP group, abdominal abscess in 5 (13%) of the 38 patients in the DPS group and none (0%) in the 9 patients in the SPDP group. At short-term, clinical findings were not different between the two groups except for a significantly greater platelet count in the DPS group than in the SPDP group (46.8 x 10(4)/microl versus 29.6 x 10(4)/microl, P = 0.0081). At long-term after the operation, clinical findings, including the platelet count, were not different between the two groups. Computed tomography revealed a pseudocyst in 9 (53%) of 17 patients examined in the DPS group and in 3 (75%) of 4 patients examined in the SPDP group at short-term after operation. All patients with pseudocysts were asymptomatic. Two asymptomatic patients (one in the DPS group and one in the SPDP group) first developed a pseudocyst at long-term after the operation. The alteration of glucose tolerance was similar between the two groups. Postoperative pancreatic exocrine function (the N-benzol-L-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid test) was not different between the two groups. These data suggest that SPDP with preservation of the splenic vessels can be satisfactorily performed without elongating operative time and postoperative hospital stay or increasing risk of postoperative complications, with the exception of increased platelet count in the DPS group at short-term after the operation. Thus, SPDP is worth considering as one of the options for the treatment of benign lesions of the body or tail of the pancreas."
CD012009,0,7531962,0,Pancreatic injuries from blunt trauma.,"Pancreatic injuries from blunt trauma are infrequent, and their diagnosis and management can be extremely difficult. Over the past 10 years we treated 13 patients with major pancreatic injuries from blunt trauma. Twelve had been involved in motor vehicle collisions, none of whom were wearing seat belts. One patient was injured in an assault. Only five patients had physical findings suggesting intra-abdominal injury. Serum amylase levels were elevated in seven of the nine patients (78%) in whom this test was obtained. Computed tomography scans demonstrated pancreatic injury in three of the four patients in whom it was performed. The five patients in whom peritoneal lavage was performed had free intraperitoneal blood from injuries to other abdominal viscera. One injury was diagnosed by ultrasound. Injuries were equally distributed throughout the pancreas, with two injuries in the head, three in the body, five in the tail, and three with injuries in both the head and the body. Five patients had ductal injuries. All patients underwent celiotomy. Eight patients required no operative management of their pancreatic injuries other than drainage. Injury Severity Score averaged 28.5 +/- 2.6 (mean +/- standard error), and mean hospital stay was 31 +/- 9.8 days. One patient with delayed diagnosis of a pancreatic injury developed a pseudocyst, but all other complications and prolonged hospitalizations were due to injuries to the head, chest, other abdominal organs, or extremities. All patients survived. The diagnosis of blunt pancreatic injury requires a high index of suspicion, and diagnostic studies may demonstrate only subtle signs of injury. Most injuries can be managed by localized resection and/or drainage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We report the first case in the literature of the salvage of a partially ischemic pancreatic allograft. The procedure consisted of resecting the head of the pancreas and draining the residual segment to the ureter with a duct-to-ureter end-to-side anastomosis. The postoperative course was uneventful, and 15 months after surgery graft function is satisfactory with a urinary amylase level of 5000 U/h.

CD012009,0,15239986,0,Central pancreatectomy with pancreaticogastrostomy for benign pancreatic pathology.,"Benign lesions of the neck and proximal body of the pancreas pose an interesting surgical challenge. If the lesions are not amenable to simple enucleation, surgeons may be faced with the choice of performing a right-sided resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy) or a left-sided resection (distal pancreatectomy) to include the lesion, resulting in resection of a substantial amount of normal pancreatic parenchyma. Central pancreatic resection has been reported with Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy reconstruction; however, this interrupts small bowel continuity and obligates an additional anastomosis. We have reviewed our experience with central pancreatectomy with pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) for benign central pancreatic pathology. Between January 1999 and December 2002, 14 central pancreatectomies were performed with PG reconstruction. There were 7 women and 7 men with a mean age of 60.9 years. Five resections were performed for islet cell tumors, three were performed for noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, two were performed for serous cystadenoma, and one each was performed for a simple cyst, pseudocyst, mucinous metaplasia, and focal chronic pancreatitis. Seven out of 14 patients experienced a total of 10 complications. Pancreatic fistulae manifested by drainage of amylase-rich fluid from the operatively placed drains developed in 5 patients (36%). Reoperation or interventional radiologic procedures were not required in any patient with a fistula. Postoperative follow-up demonstrated 13 out of 14 patients to be alive and well without evidence of pancreatic insufficiency. One patient died at home on postoperative day 57 of cardiac pathology. Central pancreatectomy with PG is a safe and effective procedure that allows for preservation of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine function without disruption of enteric continuity. The complication of pancreatic fistula was managed conservatively via maintenance of operatively placed drains."

In the past decade we have treated 10 patients with pancreaticopleural fistulas. Eight of them had a previous history of inflammatory pancreatic disease. Diagnosis was made by finding a markedly elevated amylase level (10 pts) in the pleural fluid. US and CT examination enabled the establishment of the diagnosis of pancreatic origin, showing chronic pancreatic (9 pts) and pancreatic pseudocyst (6 pts). Pancreaticopleural fistula was successfully demonstrated by ERCP in four patients. Initial treatment was non-operative using total parenteral or jejunal nutrition and multiple thoracocentesis or thoracic drainage. Anti-secretory octreotide therapy was used in all patients. This conservative treatment was successful in three patients (3/10). Septic complication (1 pt) and unsuccessful medical therapy (6 pts) recommended surgical intervention.

A postal survey was undertaken of the 517 members of the Association of upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (AUGIS). 57 surgeons undertook pancreatic resection from 162 overall respondents. Cross-checking with the list of members of the Pancreatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland yielded 64 pancreatic surgeons. 734 pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) were reported by respondents compared with 822 procedures according to Government maintained Hospital Episode Statistics. The modal resection volume performed per annum was 6-10. There were 24 in-hospital deaths in 732 resections (3%) mortality. For individual respondents the modal percentage mortality was 5% (0 to 16%). All clinicians with mortality rates in excess of 10% did less than 10 resections per annum. Respondents favoured ""amylase rich discharge beyond 7th post-operative day"" as optimal for definition of post-resection pancreatic fistula. Accepting the limitations of questionnaire surveys, the results provide an important overview of pancreatic surgical practice: pancreaticoduodenectomy is carried out by a range of specialists, lower volume resectionists appear to have poorer outcomes and this study shows widespread agreement on optimum terminology for post-operative pancreatic fistula."

Histopathological diagnosis was mature teratoma perforating into pericardiac sac, which included skin, bronchus and pancreatic tissue. We concluded that the progress of the tumor and the mechanical inflammation were major cause of perforation of the tumor into the pericardial sac, and autodigestion by enzyme from pancreas was minor cause of perforation."

We reviewed the series from four university and one central hospitals in Switzerland over a period of ten to twenty years. Among these 75 cases, 84% were consecutive to blunt trauma. All the cases with an open injury were operated on rapidly. 15 patients with blunt trauma were treated conservatively. Out of the 58 operated patients, 20 had a caudal resection, 3 a pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis and 1 a duodeno-pancreatectomy. The others were drained. Nine patients died, 5 of them as a direct consequence of the pancreatic lesions. The morbidity was high (48%). After an open abdominal trauma, or when the patient remains unstable after blunt trauma an emergency laparotomy should be undertaken. It can lead to damage control surgery as a first step when the general and local conditions are bad. When the patient is hemodynamicaly stable, a conservative approach should be considered.

They were utilized as diagnostic methods laboratory exams, especially serial seric and urinary amylase as creatinine and at the same time abdominal echography, upper gastrointestinal tract X-rays, thorax X-rays, Barium Enema and Biliary tract X-rays. Although the great number of transit accidents, the traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts were seldom found and most of them were operated as a result of a chronic pancreatitis. Contrarily the pancreatic pseudocysts as result of an acute pancreatitis and recurrent acute pancreatitis were in a limited number. We observed only 2 cases of acute pancreatitis with biliary etiology. We realized one operation in 31 cases and in one resection, four of the series, was the only occasion that we recurred for a second and a third operation. The external drainage was realized exclusively in 3 cases while internal drainage was performed 28 times. The surgical technic frequently used as internal drainage was the Roux en-Y Cystojejunostomy and was perfomed in 21 patients. This method demonstrated to be the most fit by morphologic as functional reasons.

Two pseudocysts were treated operatively; five were drained percutaneously with fluoroscopic guidance. These five ranged from 5 to 15 cm in diameter and were present for 10 to 42 days (mean, 26 days). In all cases, the cyst fluid was clear, had an amylase level of greater than 40,000 IU/L, and grew no organisms. The pigtail catheters left in place in four of the five children were removed when drainage stopped. Patients were followed by ultrasound while still in the hospital and 1 month after discharge. There were no complications nor any pseudocyst recurrence. Percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children is an effective alternative to the standard operative therapy of pseudocystenteric anastomosis."
CD012009,0,9070179,0,Complement component C5 deficiency reduces edema formation in murine ligation-induced acute pancreatitis.,"The complement cascade is activated in humans and animals with acute pancreatitis. Activation of complement component C5 liberates C5a, C5a-desarg, and terminal complement complexes (TCCs) that increase capillary permeability, edema, and leukocyte chemotaxis at injured sites. Complement activation plays a major role in pathogenesis of capillary leak and edema formation in severe acute pancreatitis; however, the contribution of C5 (C5a/C5a-desarg, TCCs) has not been defined. Using He gene mutant mice lacking circulating C5, the role of C5 in ligation-induced acute pancreatitis was evaluated. We performed the following experiments: C5-sufficient (Hc1/Hc1) and C5-deficient (Hc0/Hc0) mice had bile and pancreatic ducts ligated. Sham-operated mice had ducts dissected but not ligated. Mice were killed at 4, 8, and 24 hr after bilepancreatic duct ligation. Serologic and morphologic evidences of acute pancreatitis were evaluated. Pancreatic edema was assessed using analysis of pancreatic water content, histologic edema score, and determination of wet weight ratio. After 4, 8, and 24 hr of bile-pancreatic duct ligation, hyperamylasemia and histologic changes of acute pancreatitis were observed in both C5-deficient and C5-sufficient mice. Edema developed in all mice with acute pancreatitis. However, when compared to C5-sufficient mice, mice deficient in C5 developed significantly less pancreatic edema at both 8 and 24 hr of bile-pancreatic duct ligation. This difference was not observed 4 hr after induction of acute pancreatitis. We conclude that C5 contributes to edema formation in murine ligation-induced acute pancreatitis. The presence of an early C5-independent phase, in conjunction with the observation of significant edema in mice deficient in C5, suggests there are other mediators of edema formation in this acute pancreatitis model."

A pseudo-cyst was found 12 times out of 20 and a chronic pancreatitis without pseudocyst was found 8 times out of 20. Pleural effusion has a definite diagnostic valve, because in 70% of cases pancreatopathy cannot be recognized before it happens. The pleural liquid is rich in proteins and haemorrhagic in 2/3 of cases and its amylasic activity is either high or very high. Amylase level in pleural liquid is usually superior to amylasemia. The injection of lipiodol in the pleural cavity enables the visualization of a transdiaphragmatic fistula but this examination is not always well tolerated. The preoperatory cystography can opacify the pleura.

The review of the world medical literature gives the overall number of 2500 cases of choledochal cyst. The incidence of this disease is about 1 in 2000000, but it is about four times more frequent in the Yellow race, and 3 times more frequent in females. Congenital choledochal cyst is a disease of paediatric population, as 60% of all patients are younger than 10 years. The basic anomaly of the disease is the embryological arrest of the normal migration of the pancreaticobiliary junction towards the duodenal wall. The result of the disturbance is the extraduodenal location of the pancreaticobiliary junction and the abnormally long common biliopancreatic channel. The flow of bile and pancreatic juice in the duodenal luminary space is insufficient, so the accumulation of bile and pancreatic juice in the common channel and the reflux of this activated mixture towards biliary ducts occur. Choledochal cyst is formed with all its complications: cholangitis, liver abscess, biliary stone formation, biliary cirrhosis, acute and chronic relapsing pancreatitis, and after many years, biliary cancer. Our results in the treatment of this disease are given. We operated on 31 paediatric patients for choledochal cyst over the period 1978-1998. The study is both retrospective and prospective."

Leaks of the graft duodenum (DL) remain a significant complication after transplantation. We studied incidence and predisposing factors of DLs in both simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) and pancreas after kidney (PAK) transplantation. Between January 2002 and April 2013, 284 pancreas transplantations were performed including 191 SPK (67.3%) and 93 PAK (32.7%). Patient data were analyzed for occurrence of DLs, risk factors, leak etiology, and graft survival. Of 18 DLs (incidence 6.3%), 12 (67%) occurred within the first 100 days after transplantation. Six grafts (33%) were rescued by duodenal segment resection. Risk factors for a DL were PAK transplantation sequence (odds ratio 3.526, P = 0.008) and preoperative immunosuppression (odds ratio 3.328, P = 0.012). In the SPK subgroup, postoperative peak amylase as marker of preservation/reperfusion injury and recipient pretransplantation cardiovascular interventions as marker of atherosclerosis severity were associated with an increased incidence of DLs. CMV-mismatch constellations showed an increased incidence in the SPK subgroup, however without significance probability. Long-term immunosuppression in PAK transplantation is a major risk factor for DLs. Early surgical revision offers the chance of graft rescue."
CD012009,0,2233231,0,Pancreaticopleural fistula. Report of 7 patients and review of the literature.,"Pancreaticopleural fistula is an uncommon clinical condition. Its presentation is often confusing because of the paucity of clues suggestive of pancreatic disease and the preponderance of pulmonary symptoms and signs. Most patients are alcoholics but only one-half will have a clinical history of previous pancreatitis. Pleural effusions are large, recurrent, and highly exudative in nature. Many patients go through extensive pulmonary evaluation before the pancreas is identified as the site of primary pathology. An elevated serum amylase may be the first clue to the diagnosis. However, the key to the diagnosis is a dramatically elevated pleural fluid amylase. Effusions in association with acute pancreatitis, esophageal perforation, and thoracic malignancy are important to consider in the differential diagnosis of an elevated pleural fluid amylase but are usually easy to exclude. Computed tomography is excellent in defining pancreatic abnormalities and should be the first abdominal imaging study in suspected cases. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is used as a diagnostic tool only in confusing cases. Although no systematic study evaluates medical versus surgical therapy, we recommend an initial 2 to 4-week trial of medical therapy, including allowance of no oral intake, total parenteral nutrition, chest tube thoracostomy, and possibly a regimen of somatostatin or its analogs. The major complication in these patients is superinfection, which results in significant morbidity and mortality. Failure of medical therapy should be considered failure of pleural effusion(s) to clear, recurrence after reinstatement of oral intake, or superinfection. For those patients who fail to benefit from medical therapy, surgery is indicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD012009,0,8685947,0,Clinical determinants of glucose homeostasis after pancreas transplantation.,"Although successful simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation (SPK) achieves normoglycemia in the majority of diabetic recipients with end-stage renal disease, little is known about the factors that influence long-term endocrine function. In this prospective study of 48 bladder-drained SPK patients, 209 oral glucose tolerance tests were performed between 3 months and 6 years after transplantation. Normal fasting glucose levels and systemic hyperinsulinemia were stable for up to 6 years after SPK. Multivariate analysis revealed that increased area-under-curve (AUC) levels of C-peptide 3 months after transplantation were predicted by short surgical pancreas anastomosis time, greater recipient body weight, and total HLA mismatch score. Episodes of acute pancreas rejection were not associated with reduced allograft insulin output in the long term. Insulin output, stimulated by oral glucose tolerance tests and assessed by the ratio of AUC insulin to AUC glucose, fell gradually after transplantation and was decreased by an elevated serum calcium level and high cyclosporine dose. The ratio of fasting insulin to glucose, which acts as a marker of peripheral insulin resistance, fell with time after transplantation and was increased by greater body weight, higher prednisolone dose, and lower cyclosporine dose. The inhibitory effect of cyclosporine on both fasting and postprandial insulin output was, however, minor when quantified by multivariate analysis. Endocrine function of the transplanted pancreas was not correlated with its exocrine function measured by urinary amylase excretion, nor was there a correlation with change in renal function measured by isotopic glomerular filtration rate. In summary, simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation leads to excellent long-term glucose homeostasis maintained at the expense of systemic hyperinsulinemia. The key factors adversely affecting peripheral resistance in SPK were corticosteroid therapy, body weight, and time after transplantation. The susceptibility of islets to ischemia-reperfusion injury, as quantitated by surgical anastomosis time, may have implications for islet transplantation programs, as may the relative resistance of islets to allograft rejection. Glucose homeostasis after SPK, while remaining abnormal, may be used as the standard against which islet transplantation must be measured."

On the 7th postoperative day with stabilized pancreatic secretion the juice was collected in 10 min fractions, while interdigestive secretory phases of the parenchyma were established by volume changes. At the beginning of a phase, 100 ml slightly hyperosmolar (400 mOsm/l) oligopeptide diet with 360 kJ (90) kCal) was given as a bolus injection to another 7 patients or 60 min infusion into the second jejunal loop by fine-needle catheter jejunostomy to another 7 patients. Pancreatic water, bicarbonate, protein, chymotrypsin, peak amylase levels, and integrated secretory responses were measured. It was observed that infusion of the diet did not disturb cycling interdigestive phases and did not increase peak and integrated outputs. Bolus administration interrupted interdigestive phases and stimulated pancreatic water, bicarbonate, protein, chymotrypsin and amylase outputs nonparallelly. On the basis of the data it was concluded that pancreatic secretion seems to be well preserved without duodenal regulatory mechanisms, and continuous jejunal infusion feeding seems to be useful in pancreatic disease and in other postoperative states when pancreas has to be put into rest."

Fifth annual Samuel Jason Mixter Lecture.,"The records of 299 patients with 357 admissions for pancreatic pseudocysts seen between 1960 and 1989 were studied; 233 patients underwent operation. The natural history of pancreatic pseudocysts has been clarified by newer technology, such as ultrasonography, computer tomography, amylase isoenzyme measurements, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. All have influenced diagnosis, nonoperative management, and surgical operation. Differences between pancreatic pseudocysts associated with acute pancreatitis in contrast with chronic pancreatitis, and the complications of obstruction, hemorrhage, rupture, pancreatic ascites, infection, and jaundice can now be more rationally treated. Pancreatic pseudocysts and pancreatic ductal changes are now revealed earlier, especially by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Paradoxically, this information has encouraged nonoperative conservative therapy and also larger operations, eg, resection and adjunctive pancreaticojejunostomy. Partial resection of the pancreas together with the pancreatic pseudocysts was performed in 58 (25%) of the 233 patients. Recent technology permits cautious exploration of selective pancreatic pseudocyst drainage percutaneously or transgastroduodenally avoiding laparotomy."
CD012009,0,2421423,0,Intestinalization of pancreatic fragments in dogs.,"A new operative procedure for the preservation of pancreatic fragments is introduced (""intestinalization"") in which vascularized fragments are placed inside a jejunal pouch. This step is done to manage all secretions, lymph and potential debris coming from the pancreas; to maintain the primary portal drainage of insulin; to avoid vascular operations, and to keep the fragment in a denervated state and still preserve its endocrine function to prevent diabetes. The procedure was compared with conventional end to end pancreaticojejunostomy. Sixteen dogs were studied. Group 1 consisted of four dogs that had intestinalization of the pancreatic tail. Group 2 is made up of eight dogs that had complete resection of the remaining duodenal portion of the gland as well as intestinalization of the pancreatic tail. Group 3 consisted of four dogs that had end to end pancreaticojejunostomy to the isolated tail and complete resection of the duodenal portion of the gland as those dogs in group 2. No dog became diabetic during the time of observation (up to one year)--fasting glucose levels and K values in glucose tolerance tests remained normal. Insulin peak values at ten minutes were lower postoperatively. However, return to fasting levels occurred equally fast postoperatively. There was no difference among the groups. The most important morphologic finding in the intestinalized fragments was a firm capsule surrounding the tissue after two weeks. Exocrine atrophy was present in both groups 2 and 3 after one year. No reinnervation of intestinalized pancreas was seen. Intestinalization may offer an alternative to pancreatic resection especially when heterotopic autotransplantation is considered."
CD012009,0,1559400,0,[The management of exocrine pancreatic secretion--a central problem of allogeneic pancreas transplantation].,"In a consecutive series of 47 pancreatic transplantations, the duct occlusion technique and the bladder drainage technique are evaluated. Major problems, when using the duct occlusion technique are pancreatic fistulae with secondary infections and bleedings. Early postoperative graft thrombosis remains a crucial problem. Finally, graft rejection can not be diagnosed in time when using the duct occlusion technique. In contrast, the bladder drainage technique guarantees an absolutely safe management of the exocrine pancreas secretion. The risk of early postoperative graft thromboses reaches nearly zero. In addition, by monitoring urinary amylase and thereby the function of the exocrine pancreas, rejection episodes can be diagnosed very early. Early postoperative graft pancreatitis of the bladder drained pancreatic allografts remains a significant problem. In addition due to excessive bicarbonate loss via the urine oral bicarbonate substitution is necessary. A high incidence of urinary tract infections as well as unspecific irritations of the urinary tract are further drawbacks of the bladder drainage technique. They can be managed, however, relatively easily. Since using the bladder drainage technique, 1-year-graft-function rate of the pancreatic allografts increased by more than 40% and reaches now 88%. The new operative technique represents the best surgical procedure for control of the exocrine secretion of pancreatic allografts at the moment. Simultaneous pancreas-/kidney transplantation in the technique described can therefore be recommended a selected group of type-I diabetics with end-stage renal disease as the therapy of choice."

Three of the 5 had undergone laparotomy but in only 1 had the pancreatic injury been noted. All 5 had elevated serum amylase activity on admission here, but in only 2 had this been measured in the referring hospital. Three were seriously ill at the time of transfer, and all 6 patients required prolonged hospitalization (1.3--5.5 mo). The lesion resolved spontaneously in 1, and was drained externally in 3 and by cystogastrostomy alone i 1. One child required multiple surgical procedures, terminating in subtotal pancreatectomy. The seriousness of this lesion demands constant alertness to the possibility of pancreatic pseudocysts in children who have suffered upper abdominal trauma, however minor."

Duration of symptoms ranged from 2 to 36 years. Seven of the eight patients had hereditary pancreatitis. Recurrent epigastric pain was characteristic and serum amylase was elevated in all patients on admission or shortly thereafter. Demonstration of an obstructed dilated pancreatic duct in all and stones in seven of eight patients by operative pancreatography in three early patients and by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in five others established the therapeutic problem and facilitated treatment by removal of stones and longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy. Results were uniformly excellent, both in the early postoperative period and in long-range follow-ups. Early diagnosis and early surgical drainage of the obstructed pancreatic duct by longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy are desirable objectives in chronic relapsing pancreatitis with onset in childhood."

Extrapancreatic locations of pancreatic pseudocyst in the liver, pleura, mediastinum, or pelvis have been described. However, a pancreatic pseudocyst located in the liver is an infrequent condition. We present the case of a 46-year-old man with pancreatic pseudocyst located in the liver secondary to chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. During admission, the patient underwent an abdominal CT scan that showed a mass located in the head and body of the pancreas, as well as a thrombosis of the splenic vein. A percutaneous needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreas was obtained under CT guidance, which showed no tumoral involvement. Fourty-eight hours after the procedure the patient developed abdominal pain and elevated serum amylase levels. A pancreatic MRI exam showed two pancreatic pseudocysts, one of them located in the left hepatic lobe, the other in the pancreatic tail. Chronic pancreatitis signs also were found. Enteral nutrition via a nasojejunal tube was administered for two weeks. The disappearance of the pancreatic pseudocyst located in the pancreatic tail, and a subtotal resolution of the pancreatic pseudocyst located in the liver were observed. To date twenty-seven cases of pancreatic pseudocyst located in the liver have been published, most of them managed with percutaneous or surgical drainage."
CD012009,0,7218391,0,Experiences in the management of pancreatic trauma.,"A 30-year experience in the management of 283 consecutive patients with acute pancreatic trauma was reviewed. Of these injuries 224 were penetrating; 59 were from blunt trauma. Diagnosis was made by laparotomy in all patients, although elevated serum amylase suggested this injury in 23 (56%) of 41 patients with nonpenetrating injuries. Operative measures were initially involved with correction of associated injury when present (961 organ injuries in 278 patients: 3.5 injuries per patient). During the earlier years, Penrose drains were placed to the site of injury. Significant pancreatic complications (fistula in 13, suppurative pancreatitis or abscess in six, pseudocyst in three) were noted in 19 (46%) of the 41 patients so managed. Routine sump drainage dramatically reduced the incidence of pancreatic complications to 2% in the 198 patients having external drainage alone. Distal resection was performed in 29 patients, without later pancreatic insufficiency. Most disappointing were the results from Roux-en-Y internal drainage: fistula developed in five and lethal bacterial pancreatitis in three of the seven patients so treated. Five patients died from exsanguination during exploration for major vascular trauma, and all three patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy succumbed within 20 hours after operation. The overall mortality was 13.8%, with only seven deaths out of the last 100 patients treated. Profound hemorrhagic shock and its complications (19), suppurative pancreatitis (eight), and post-traumatic respiratory insufficiency (three) accounted for 30 of the 39 fatalities."

CD012009,0,12828106,0,Duodenum-preserving resection of the pancreatic head with the ultrasonic coagulating shears.,"Duodenum-preserving resection of the pancreatic head is a risk factor for pancreatic fistula because of the wide surface of the transected pancreas. We report on a 72-year-old woman undergoing this procedure for cystadenoma in the pancreatic head using the ultrasonic coagulating shears. The soft pancreatic parenchyma was extensively transected around the cyst with the coagulating shears. Suture of the cut stump was not necessary due to absence of bleeding. The distal pancreatic duct was well preserved for pancreatojejunostomy. We oversewed the possible opening of the main pancreatic duct on the remaining pancreas attached to the duodenum after confirming the location by intrabiliary dye injection. The postoperative course was uneventful. The draining fluid amylase level was low and there were no viscous materials from the drains. We compared histologic changes of a porcine pancreas transected with the coagulating shears or electrocautery to evaluate the sealing effect of the transected surface. The cut stump was covered by a continuing layer of thick protein coagulum in cases of coagulating shears, but by a disrupted layer of coagulating necrosis with charring in cases of electrocautery. The coagulating shears are useful for pancreatic transection in duodenum-preserving resection of the pancreatic head to prevent bleeding and pancreatic fistula from the cut surface."

The study group was composed of 123 patients who underwent left pancreatectomy since 1996. Pancreatic closure was accomplished by a hand-sewn technique (39 patients) or two kinds of mechanical staplers: Proximate (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH) (46 patients) and Endo-GIA (United States Surgical, Norwalk, CT) (38 patients). Fistula was defined as output greater than 5 ml, with amylase x 5, after day 5. In case of fistula, the drain removal was scheduled at a daily output less than 5 ml. Mortality was 0%, morbidity was 48%, and pancreatic fistula rate was 34%. Fistula rate was 38% after hand-sewn closure, 26% after Proximate, and 39% after Endo-GIA (NS). None of the other factors (separate duct ligation, hand-sewn suture in addition to stapler, spleen preservation, use of pledgetted suture, sex, age, and indication for pancreatectomy) proved to be related to a reduction in the onset of fistula. All fistulas healed spontaneously. Mean fistula duration was 36 days; 92.8% of patients with fistula were discharged with drain. The policy of delayed drain removal allowed a low rate of fistula associated morbidity (16%) and of readmission (4.7%). In conclusion, fistula is an unsolved problem of left pancreatectomy. However, a careful drain management allows a good outcome in patients with fistula."

CD012009,0,7509356,0,The acute effects of pancreaticopyelostomy on the pancreas and kidney. A preliminary study.,"A modified canine pancreaticopyelostomy model with an intact kidney was constructed. The effects of this procedure on the pancreas and kidney were examined in five dogs by monitoring the serum and urine levels of pH, bicarbonate, chloride, glucose, urea, creatinine and amylase in 24-h periods for up to 72 h. The contralateral kidney served as controls. The pancreas and kidney were removed and examined under light microscopy after the animals were sacrificed. Both of the organs had maintained their normal histological architecture. The serum and urine glucose levels were consistent with a normal response after the initial elevation immediately following the surgical trauma. The urine urea concentrations from both kidneys were similar, as were the creatinine excretion trends throughout the 72 h, except for a significant rise in the creatinine excretion on the pancreaticopyelostomy side at 24 h. The pH, bicarbonate, chloride, and amylase values revealed a normal and functioning exocrine pancreas. It is concluded from this preliminary study that pancreaticopyelostomy with an intact kidney does not have acute adverse effects, either on the pancreas or on the kidney. This procedure may be an alternative method for pancreatic exocrine drainage if similar results are obtained in chronic models."

CD012009,0,2799640,0,Dorsal duct sphincterotomy is effective long-term treatment of acute pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum.,"Nonbiliary, nonalcoholic pancreatic inflammatory disease was investigated by biochemical investigation, ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and secretin tests. Twenty-five consecutive cases were followed up for 12 months to 10 years after treatment of disease associated with pancreas divisum, diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Thirteen patients had no recurrence of acute pancreatitis after dorsal duct sphincterotomy alone, during long-term follow-up (mean, 54 months); one patient had recurrent pancreatitis during 33 months after failed sphincterotomy. Eight patients had variable results 12 months to 8 years (mean, 49 months) after dorsal duct sphincterotomy for pancreatic pain syndrome (without amylase elevation), three were pain free, and one had recurrent pancreatitis. For 10 years after dorsal duct sphincterotomy for chronic pancreatitis, one patient had no pain relief; after subtotal pancreatectomy and pancreaticojejunostomy of the dorsal duct, both for chronic pancreatitis, one patient each was pain free and normoglycemic after 54 and 12 months, respectively. Dorsal duct sphincterotomy alone is successful in achieving long-term freedom from recurrence of acute pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum. Pancreatic pain syndrome is not consistently improved by dorsal duct sphincterotomy. Chronic pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum should be treated by resection or drainage procedures, not by dorsal duct sphincterotomy."
CD012009,0,23624444,0,Diagnosis and management of pancreaticopleural fistula.,"Pancreaticopleural fistula is a rare diagnosis requiring a high index of clinical suspicion due to the predominant manifestation of thoracic symptoms. The current literature suggests that confirmation of elevated pleural fluid amylase is the most important diagnostic test. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is the recommended imaging modality to visualise the fistula, as it is superior to both computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in delineating the tract within the pancreatic region. It is also less invasive than ERCP. While a trial of medical regimen has traditionally been the first-line treatment, failure would result in higher rates of complications. Hence, it is suggested that management strategies be planned based on pancreatic ductal imaging, with patients having poor chances of spontaneous closure undergoing either endoscopic or surgical intervention. We also briefly describe a case of pancreaticopleural fistula in a patient who was treated using a modified Puestow procedure after failed endoscopic treatment."

CD012009,0,8623171,0,Isolated pancreas rejection in combined kidney pancreas tranplantation.,"The clinical success of pancreas transplantation is limited by the difficulty in diagnosing rejection. In simultaneous pancreas kidney (SPK) transplantation, the diagnosis of pancreatic rejection is particularly difficult in the absence of clinical evidence of kidney rejection. Moreover, patients receiving only pancreas grafts will not have a concomitantly grafted kidney to serve as a ""sentinel"" for rejection. Percutaneous pancreas graft biopsy has been reported in a few small series but has not been adopted for broad clinical use. We describe the evaluation of 69 consecutive episodes of suspected isolated pancreas allograft rejection by percutaneous pancreas allograft biopsy. These rejection episodes occurred in 41 patients with bladder-drained pancreas transplants (25 SPK, 14 pancrease after kidney transplants [PAK], amd two pancreas transplant alone [PTA]). The indications for percutaneous pancreas biopsy were a twofold or greater increase in serum amylase or lipase, or a sustained 40% to 50% drop in urine amylase in the setting of no evidence of renal allograft dysfunction in SPK transplants. Biopsies were performed with color-flow Doppler ultrasound localization using an 18-gauge automated biopsy needle. Pancreatic tissue adequate for histologic evaluation was obtained in 61 of 69 cases (88%). There were two cases of intraabdominal bleeding, one of which required surgical intervention; the other resolved spontaneously. Histologic assessment of the biopsies demonstrated varying degrees of acute cellular rejection in 48 of 61 specimens (79%). Twelve specimens (20%) were free of histologic evidence of rejection, and one specimen (2%) showed acute pancreatitis. At the time of suspected rejection mean serum amylase and lipase values were increased 3.6 and 8.3-fold, respectively, and urine amylase was decreased by a mean of 45%. We conclude that the commonly used markers for pancreas allograft rejection are only about 80% specific for acute rejection. Percutaneous pancreas allograft biopsy is safe and allows the avoidance of unnecessary antirejection therapy with its attendant side effects and cost."

CD012009,0,7524375,0,"Pancreatic anastomotic leak after pancreaticoduodenectomy: incidence, significance, and management.","Anastomotic leak at the pancreaticojejunostomy remains a common and dreaded complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Our aim was to determine the incidence, presentation, methods of management, and preoperative and postoperative factors that influence the clinical outcome. We reviewed our collective experience with 375 consecutive patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy from 1980 to 1992 for a variety of pathologic indications. Clinical, biochemical, intraoperative, and postoperative factors were reviewed in an attempt to determine prognostic factors. Sixty-six patients (18%) developed a pancreatic anastomotic leak as determined by increased amylase in drainage fluid (44%), radiographic documentation (41%), operative re-exploration (9%), or percutaneous drainage of a peripancreatic, amylase-containing fluid collection (6%). Most leaks (73%) were clinically insignificant and were managed by simple maintenance of intraoperatively placed drains. Active intervention was required in 18 patients (27%) and included percutaneous drainage in 8, completion pancreatectomy in 7, and reoperative drainage with or without anastomotic repair in 3. Although octreotide was used therapeutically in 13 patients (20%), a significant, objective response was noted in only 1 patient. Five (8%) of the 66 patients died, all related directly to the pancreatic leak. The overall operative mortality was lower, 15 (4%) of 375 patients. Of the clinical, biochemical, intraoperative, and postoperative factors reviewed to determine prognostic factors, only postoperative intra-abdominal hemorrhage predisposed the patient to mortality as a result of the pancreatic anastomotic leak. We conclude that most anastomotic leaks at the pancreaticojejunostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy can be managed conservatively. Use of octreotide to aid in closure of the pancreatic leak was disappointing, whereas patients with postoperative intra-abdominal hemorrhage or those requiring completion pancreatectomy to manage the anastomotic leak have increased mortality."

CD012009,0,25301343,0,[The role of drains in pancreatic surgery].,"Pancreatic fistula is a significant complication following pancreatic resection. Several methods aimed at lowering the postoperative pancreatic fistula rate were studied in the past. These methods mainly include pharmacological prophylaxis and technical modifications of pancreatic remnant management. Another method which can influence postoperative pancreatic fistula rate is the use of and the manipulation with intra-abdominal drains following pancreatic resection. Recent studies have shown that the use of the drains, the type of drain and manipulation with the drains can influence the outcomes. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge about the use of drains in pancreatic surgery. There are three questions to ask when studying the use of drains in pancreatic surgery: 1) Whether to use the drains at all 2) When to remove the drains? 3) Which type of the drain is more appropriate? Ad 1) Despite the growing number of studies showing comparable or even better results in patients without intra-abdominal drains following pancreatic resection, the latest randomized study proved that avoiding the use of drains is associated with more clinically significant postoperative complications and higher postoperative mortality. It is also important to consider the risk factors of pancreatic fistula development, especially pancreatic texture and the main pancreatic duct diameter. Currently, pancreatic resection without intra-abdominal drains cannot be routinely recommended. Ad 2) Two studies addressed the question when to remove the drains after pancreatic resection, and both studies clearly showed that early removal brings better results. Ad 3) No study has specifically addressed the question whether the type of drain can influence the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula and of other complications. Gravity drains and closed-suction drains are most commonly used nowadays. The closed-suction drains are more effective due to the active suction. On the other hand, active suction can cause leak of the amylase-rich fluid through the pancreatic anastomosis or suture line and thus promote the development of pancreatic fistula or even worsen its clinical significance. There are no data in the literature so far regarding the type of drain. Therefore, we have commenced a randomized control trial which aims to compare closed-suction drains and closed gravity drains."
CD012009,0,8871464,0,Pancreaticopleural fistula: a rare complication of chronic pancreatitis.,"Pancreaticopleural fistula is an uncommon sequelae of pancreatitis. The condition is often elusive, as respiratory rather than abdominal symptoms usually predominate and the fistula can be difficult to demonstrate radiologically. Confirmation is by demonstrating a high amylase content in the pleural aspirate relative to the serum. About half the fistulae will close with conservative treatment but persistent or recurrent effusions, often associated with stenosis or disruption of the main pancreatic duct, are an indication for surgery. The long-term outcome is good in 80-95% of cases. We report five patients with pleural effusion of pancreatic origin due to pancreaticopleural fistula."
CD012009,0,15472543,0,Application of a new collagen-based sealant for the treatment of pancreatic injury.,"Pancreatic injury is the most frequent serious morbidity that can occur following laparoscopic splenectomy. The presumed mechanism of injury is direct trauma to the pancreatic tail during hilar dissection or transection with endovascular staplers. It was our aim to study the direct application of topical sealants to a pancreatic injury to prevent a pancreatic leak. A porcine model of pancreatic injury in a normal pancreas was developed. Fourteen animals underwent midline laparotomy and subtotal (8 cm) distal pancreatectomy. The pancreas was sharply divided and minimal cauterization used. A (1/4)-inch round Jackson Pratt drain was secured to the pancreatic stump in all animals. The control group (n = 7) underwent no further treatment. Two groups underwent treatment with a sealant. Group 1 (n = 3) had a hydrogel applied to the pancreatic remnant. Group 2 (n = 4) had a biodegradable sealant of PEG (polyethylene glycol)-collagen formulation applied to the pancreatic stump by aerosol. During the postoperative period, animals were fed 2.2 lb/d of a high fat (10% lard) diet to stimulate pancreatic exocrine function. Total daily drain outputs were recorded, and drain amylase content and serum amylase concentration were measured on postoperative days 3, 7, and 10. A significant pancreatic leak was defined as a drain to serum amylase content of greater than 3:1. Animals were killed on day 10 and explored for undrained fluid collections. The pancreas was removed for histologic evaluation. Control and treatment groups were compared using repeated measures ANOVA of log-transformed data. All animals survived until elective necropsy. In group 1, average total drain outputs were not significantly less than the controls (125 mL versus 269; P = .66). The mean drain/serum amylase concentration on days 3, 7, and 10 were not significantly different between group 1 and the control group. Group 2 had significantly less overall average drainage output than controls (40 mL versus 269 mL; P = .0006). Furthermore, group 2 had a significant reduction in pancreatic leaks on days 3, 7, and 10 as measured by mean drain/serum amylase concentration. No undrained fluid collections were identified at autopsy. Based on our experimental porcine model, a novel collagen-based, biodegradable hydrogel can prevent a ductal leak following pancreatic injury. These encouraging data have fostered application by aerosol treatment to the hilar bed at laparoscopic splenectomy to diminish capsular disruption from mechanical injury."
CD012009,0,17001484,0,The leaking pancreatic duct in childhood chronic pancreatitis.,"The leaking pancreatic duct in childhood chronic pancreatitis presents with ascites and pleural effusion and is a potentially lethal condition. Seven children with this condition were seen in the period 2003-2006. The correct diagnosis was not entertained till a raised serum amylase was discovered. The diagnosis was confirmed by very high levels of amylase in the aspirated abdominal or pleural fluid. Computerized tomogram was the most useful imaging study and demonstrated a dilated pancreatic duct. All children were operated within 6 days of diagnosis by a Puestow's procedure in six and peripancreatic drainage in one. Six children made a prompt and lasting recovery after a Puestow's procedure while one child, also suffering from metastatic neuroblastoma, died in the immediate post operative period after peripancreatic drainage. We recommend prompt and definitive surgical management of this potentially lethal condition."
CD012009,0,15759197,0,The value of endoscopic diagnosis and the treatment of pancreas injuries following blunt abdominal trauma.,"Injuries to the pancreas following blunt abdominal trauma are rare due to its protected retroperitoneal position. Many pancreatic lesions remain unnoticed at first and only become apparent when complications arise or during treatment of other injuries. The mortality rate is between 12 and 30%, and if treatment is delayed it is as high as 60%."
CD012009,0,2445612,0,Lactoferrin in acute necrotizing pancreatitis.,"Lactoferrin, as measured in the pancreatic juice, has been thought to be of diagnostic value in chronic pancreatitis, but due to the hazards in cannulation of the pancreatic duct in the acute phase of pancreatitis the behavior of lactoferrin has remained obscure. In this study, lactoferrin levels were studied in pancreas tissue specimens obtained in ablative surgery for acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and in serum samples. A higher pancreatic lactoferrin content was found in ANP than in normal pancreas. Lactoferrin seemed not to leak from a necrotic pancreas in any considerable amounts into the circulation, as no differences were found in serum lactoferrin concentrations between ANP and controls. It remains an open question whether the lactoferrin increase is only an unspecific reaction in inflammation or is something specific for pancreatitis."
CD012009,0,1124220,0,Pancreatic and gastrointestinal trauma in children.,"Injuries to the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract following blunt abdominal trauma continue to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric age group. Optimal treatment of these injuries is frequently hampered by considerable delays in diagnosis. Factors contributing to these delays include the location of much of the duodenum and the pancreas in the retroperitoneum resulting in an absence of initial symptoms and signs, the often trivial nature of some of the responsible blunt traumatic accidents, inappropriate child-parent or child-physician communication, failure to achieve a meaningful physical examination in uncooperative or unconscious patients, and false negative paracentesis. Eighty per cent of these injuries occurred in boys. Eleven of 16 patients with pancreatic trauma had pseudocysts. A persistently elevated serum amylase level was invariably noted and epigastric mass was palpable in eight patients. Significant delays in diagnosis were prevalent and pseudocysts was misdiagnosed as appendicitis in three cases. Internal drainage by cystgastrostomy or cystjejunostomy was effective operative treatment. In instances of acute pancreatic injuries, sump drains, gastrostomy, cholecystostomy, and total parenteral hyperalimentation were useful therapeutic adjuncts. There was one death for a 6.2 per cent mortality rate. Forty patients had gastrointestinal injuries involving the duodenum in 17, jejunum in 14, ileum in seven, and stomach in two. Perforations occured in 65 per cent of cases, obstructing hematomas in 30 per cent, and mesenteric avulsions in 5 per cent. Associated injuries were observed in 15 patients (37.5 per cent). Pain and tenderness were the only consistent findings. Upper gastrointestinal contrast studies were diagnostic of duodenal hematomas. Eighty per cent of perforations were managed by simple closures and 20 per cent by resection and anastomosis. Obstructing hematomas unassociated with other injuries may be expected to resolve without requiring operation in 50 per cent of patients managed conservatively. Complications occurred in 35 per cent of patients and the mortality rate was 12.5 per cent (five deaths)."
CD012009,0,9823403,0,Conversion from bladder to enteric drainage after pancreaticoduodenal transplantations.,"Bladder drainage is the most common technique for managing the exocrine secretions of pancreaticoduodenal grafts. However, bladder drainage can cause urinary, pancreatic, and metabolic complications that may require conversion to enteric drainage. With enteric drainage, urinary amylase levels cannot be monitored as a marker for rejection. After enteric conversion, rejection is the major cause of graft loss. Timing the conversion to reduce immunologic graft loss would greatly improve patient and graft survival rates. Our study was designed to assess the incidence of, indications for, and complications of converting from bladder to enteric drainage after pancreaticoduodenal transplantations."
CD012009,0,2464771,0,Relapsing pleural exudate complicating chronic pancreatitis.,"Chronic pancreatitis, often with a pseudocyst, is a rare cause of a pleural exudate. A pancreatic pleural fistula is created, leading to a relapsing massive haemorrhagic pleural exudate with a very high amylase content. The diagnosis is confirmed by means of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography. Treatment is primarily conservative; surgical drainage is sometimes necessary. The prognosis is generally favourable. The case history of a young woman with this condition is presented."
CD012009,0,2450446,0,Percutaneous aspiration and drainage of abdominal fluid collections after pancreatic transplantation.,"Pancreatic transplantation, performed to avert or delay the long-term complications of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is sometimes complicated by the development of intraabdominal fluid collections. We performed 33 sonographically guided and CT-guided percutaneous abdominal aspiration and drainage procedures in 22 transplant patients; 25 procedures were done with the pancreatic graft-in-situ, and eight were done after removal of the transplant. All 11 percutaneous aspirations performed in 10 patients were successful in obtaining microbiologic culture material, and there were no complications. Sixteen percutaneous catheter drainages were performed in 13 patients with the graft-in-situ. Subsequent surgical intervention was avoided after only five (31%) of these drainage procedures. However, further intervention was unnecessary after five (83%) of six percutaneous catheter drainages in five patients who had previously undergone transplant pancreatectomy. No significant short-term or long-term complications were identified. Guided percutaneous aspiration of abdominal fluid collections after pancreatic transplantation is a safe and effective means of obtaining diagnostic material, and guided catheter drainage is definitive treatment in approximately one-third of procedures with the graft-in-situ and in most procedures done after removal of the graft."
CD012009,0,3566376,0,Cystic tumors mistaken for pancreatic pseudocysts.,"A small fraction of pancreatic cysts are neoplastic rather than inflammatory in origin. Failure to recognize the true nature of a neoplastic cyst will lead to an incorrect treatment strategy. This is a report of eight patients whose cystic neoplasms were misdiagnosed and maltreated. Five of the eight tumors proved to be malignant. Five were drained by anastomosis to a viscus and one by aspiration; drainage was recommended for the other two. Treatment by drainage led to complications (persistent painful gastric ulcer, infection in the cysts), growth of new cysts, no cures, but missed opportunities to cure cancer. Three patients with no metastases at first operation had metastatic spread to the liver, omentum, or lungs at reoperation. In three of the five cases initially treated by cystenterostomy (including one cancer), subsequent resection was possible and probably curative. One cystadenocarcinoma was watched for 3 years before apparently curative resection. Guidelines based on serum and cyst amylase levels, morphologic appearance, angiography, pancreatography, and biopsy are given for the purpose of differentiating inflammatory cysts from neoplastic cysts of the pancreas. Confusion of these entities should not occur, but errors can often be corrected."
CD012009,0,16001676,0,The role of surgery in pancreatic pseudocyst.,"Surgery has been the only option available for many years for treating pseudocyst of the pancreas. Recently, new methods, such as percutaneous drainage, endoscopic transenteric drainage and transpapillary drainage, began to be used for treatment of the pseudocyst. But we have to agree that no single technique offers the desired combination of 100% success and no complications. We'd like to present our surgical experience in the past 14 years."
CD012009,0,7766474,0,[Treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocyst by percutaneous Huisman's drainage].,"Pancreatic pseudocysts is a complication of acute posttraumatic pancreatitis. They usually cause recurrent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and elevation of serum amylase levels. A history of epigastric blunt trauma, the before mentioned clinical signs and echographic or scanning studies may lead to a certain diagnosis. Although most of them resolve spontaneously, some persist and active therapeutic measures are required. Surgical internal drainage has been the operative technique of choice in children. Nevertheless, treatment can be achieved by percutaneous aspiration or drainage of pancreatic recurrent collections. We present our experience in two children with posttraumatic pancreatic pseudocyst, treated successfully by means of a percutaneous transabdominal pig-tail catheter (Huisman catheter). The technique of catheter placement and clinical aspects are discussed."
CD012009,0,646495,0,Management of pancreatic trauma.,"Since 1950, 300 patients sustaining pancreatic injuries have been managed. Three-fourths of the injuries were due to penetrating trauma with a 20% mortality and one-fourth due to blunt trauma resulting in an 18% mortality. The pancreatic injury was responsible for death in only 3% of patients. Early onset of shock resulted in 38% mortality whereas only 4% of normotensive patients died. No patient died of an isolated pancreatic injury. Sepsis was the second most common cause of death following hemorrhage. Preoperative serum amylase was elevated more frequently following blunt trauma than penetrating trauma, but did not correlate with injury. There has been a tendency toward more frequent use of distal pancreatectomy for simple penetrating injuries without obvious ductal violation which increases operative time, blood loss and possible intra-abdominal abscess since resection usually requires splenectomy. Patients considered for an 80% distal resection are better managed with a Roux-en-Y limb to the distal pancreas since three patients developed diabetes following an 80% or greater resection. A conservative approach consisting of Penrose and sump drainage is adequate for most injuries."
CD012009,0,20460853,0,[A case of pancreatic carcinoma presenting as pancreaticopleural fistula with pancreatic pleural effusion].,"A 63-year-old man was admitted with left pleural effusion, and an amylase level of 30994IU/l. A diagnosis of pancreaticopleural fistula was made, based on the findings of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP). After the placement of an endoscopic naso-pancreatic drainage tube, the pleural effusion markedly reduced. When ERP was performed for internal drainage, the main pancreatic duct and stricture were biopsied and showed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma histologically. CT revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas. He underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of pancreatic carcinoma presenting as pancreaticopleural fistula with pancreatic pleural effusion. Clinicians should pay attention to the possible presence of cancer and pancreaticopleural fistula in patients with pancreatic pleural effusion."

CD012009,0,6737522,0,Duodenal trauma: experience of a trauma center.,"In the past decade 93 patients with duodenal injury were treated at a trauma center. By chart review, the age, sex, mechanism of injury, time to initial exploration (and the reason for delay), laboratory results, associated injury, extent of duodenal injury, operative repair, use of drains and tube decompression, morbidity, and cause of death were tabulated in order to improve management of these injuries. Of 87 patients surviving until the time of operative repair 73% required no repair (four) or primary closure (59). The remainder had either resection with primary anastomosis (ten), diverticulization (12), or pancreaticoduodenectomy (two). All patients with penetrating trauma were immediately explored. Patients with blunt trauma were explored on the basis of the judgment of house staff and faculty. Overall mortality was 18%. Significant morbidity occurred in 49% of survivors. This urban experience was heavily weighted toward penetrating injury. In this group early death usually resulted from associated vascular injuries. Blunt duodenal injury was less frequently associated with immediate exsanguination. Mortality associated with blunt duodenal injury was usually the result of delayed diagnosis. In blunt duodenal trauma peritoneal lavage is not diagnostic and may often be misleading; in this series 50% of lavages were false negatives. Blunt duodenal trauma, particularly when combined with pancreatic injury or delayed repair, was a lethal combination. A high index of suspicion and aggressive diagnostic evaluation (CT contrast study/amylase) in the emergency department is required in equivocal cases to avoid morbidity and mortality."

CD012009,0,6155900,0,Massive pancreatic serous effusions.,"The condition of massive pancreatic serous effusion is being increasingly recognized as a specific complication of pancreatitis. It occurs as a result of leakage of pancreatic juice into the pleural or peritoneal cavity after disruption of the duct system. Five such cases are described. The difficulties in making the diagnosis are mainly due to the absence of symptoms of pancreatitis, and most patients present because of the effects of the effusion. Once suspected, the diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of a grossly elevated amylase level in the fluid. A rational surgical approach is usually successful, and depends on the demonstration of a leak from a pseudocyst or disruption of the pancreatic duct system."

CD012009,0,1281951,0,[Simultaneous en-bloc allotransplantation of pancreas and kidney in the animal model. Comparison of separate organ and en-bloc pancreas/kidney transplantation in swine].,"The high technical complication rate of pancreas transplantation requires large animal models to improve clinical transplant survival rates. The pig is a very suitable animal due to its anatomy, physiology and immunology which are similar to humans. In this study a model of en-bloc simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation was established which--in contrast to separate transplantation of both organs--decreases preservation time, operation time, and clamp time. Furthermore, the rates of intra- and postoperative complications were reduced compared with separate transplantation. The donor aorta (encompassing celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, and left renal artery) is anastomosed en-bloc to the recipients aorta in a an oblique-to-side fashion. The portal vein is anastomosed end-to-side to the left common iliac vein. The exocrine pancreatic secretions are drained via duodenocystostomy to allow for monitoring of urinary amylase for rejection. The en-bloc technique is an alternative for pediatric donor organs since the risk of vascular complications is lower compared with separate implantation of the donor vessels. Based on our results in a large animal model the en-bloc technique could be used in adult uremic diabetic patients who receive a combined pancreas-kidney transplant from a pediatric cadaver donor."
CD012009,0,2427798,0,Urinary amylase monitoring for early diagnosis of pancreas allograft rejection in dogs.,"The diagnosis of pancreas allograft rejection is usually made on the basis of blood glucose concentration, a late indicator of rejection. We performed segmental pancreas transplants in totally pancreatectomized dogs with the exocrine secretions drained into the bladder (ductocystostomy). We directly measured exocrine pancreatic secretions (urinary amylase), in an attempt to find a sensitive indicator for early rejection. Five groups were studied: (I) autografts; (II) autografts immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (CsA), azathioprine and prednisone; (III) allografts without immunosuppression; (IV) allografts immunosuppressed with CsA alone; (V) allografts immunosuppressed with CsA, azathioprine, and prednisone. The control groups (I, II) maintained high urine amylase concentrations indefinitely (mean +/- SE of 125,544 +/- 36,931 u/liter). Rejection, as diagnosed by rise of serum glucose to greater than 150 mg/dl, occurred at a mean (+/- SE) of 9.0 +/- 0.2 days in nonimmunosuppressed recipients of Group III, at 9.3 +/- 0.7 days in cyclosporine-treated dogs of Group IV, and at 28.0 +/- 8.3 days after transplantation in dogs immunosuppressed with triple therapy of Group V. In all allograft recipients, urine amylase declined precipitously (less than 1000 u/liter) before the onset of hyperglycemia, by 1.3 +/- 0.2 days in Group III, 3.3 +/- 1.0 days in Group IV, and 9.4 +/- 2.8 days in Group V. In a further experiment, nine dogs with pancreas allografts received cyclosporine for prophylactic immunosuppression; further antirejection therapy with azathioprine and antilymphocyte globulin was given for 5 days beginning the first day that rejection was diagnosed. In five dogs (Group A) rejection was diagnosed when serum glucose rose to greater than 150 mg/dl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A potential clinical aid.,"Isoamylase analysis by isoelectric focusing was performed in the serum of 30 healthy volunteers, 65 patients with acute or chronic pancreatic diseases, nine with acute abdomen, four with macroamylasemia, and four with duodenal duplication. In controls, up to four fractions (2 salivary, 2 pancreatic) were found; the pancreatic fractions were as a mean 44.7% (SD 8.6) of total. In chronic pancreatitis, only patients with steatorrhea showed a significant reduction of pancreatic isoamylase (p less than 0.001). In all patients with acute pancreatitis or pseudocysts, an additional fraction (similar to the so-called P3 fraction) was resolved. Moreover, additional isoenzymes were found in all patients with severe acute pancreatitis or pseudocysts, and not in controls or patients with mild forms, acute abdomen or duodenal duplication. A similar pattern was shown in a stored control serum after 10 mo at -20 degrees C. These fractions disappeared after successful surgical drainage. No specific alteration was found in pancreatic cancer. Amylase fractionation by isoelectric focusing can be used to confirm an acute pancreatitis, and to monitor patients with pancreatic pseudocysts and collections after surgical drainage."
CD012009,0,7694532,0,Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas: problems in differential diagnosis.,"From 1970 to 1990 we observed 18 patients with histologically proven pancreatic cystic tumors. The average duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 14.1 months. A presumptive diagnosis was made preoperatively in nine patients. CT-guided fine needle cytology performed in three cases correctly showed a benign lesion in one patient and malignancy in two patients. Amylase and tumoral marker levels (CEA, CA19-9) were low in cystic fluid of two patients with cystadenomas who underwent preoperative percutaneous aspiration. Intraoperative biopsy of the cystic wall failed to detect epithelial lining in two cases; one patient had internal drainage for cystadenocarcinoma mistaken for pancreatic pseudocyst. Sixteen patients underwent surgery, two of whom died. Of the seven patients with a malignant condition, resection for cure was performed on three. The preoperative diagnosis of these very rare tumors remains difficult. Fine-needle cytology and cystic fluid examination may be a promising technique, but resection of all suspected lesions, whenever possible, is the procedure of choice for diagnosis and treatment."
CD012009,0,20009748,0,Management of severe acute pancreatitis: a surgical odyssey.,"Throughout much of history, surgery of the pancreas was restricted to drainage of abscesses and treatment of traumatic wounds. At the turn of the 20th century under the impetus of anesthesia, such surgical stalwarts as Mayo Robson, Mickulicz, and Moynihan began to deploy laparotomy and gauze drainage in an effort to salvage patients afflicted with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Over the next thirty years, surgical intervention in SAP became the therapy for choice, despite surgical mortality rates that often exceeded 50%.When the discovery of the serum test for amylase revealed that clinically milder forms of acute pancreatitis existed that could respond to nonoperative therapy, a wave of conservatism emerged, and, for the next quarter century, surgical intervention for SAP was rarely practiced. However, by the 1960s, conservative mortality rates for SAP were reported to be as high as 60% to 80%, leading surgeons to not only refine the indications for surgery in SAP, but also to consider new approaches. Extensive pancreatic resections for SAP became the vogue in continental surgical centers in the 1960s and 1970s, but often resulted in high mortality rates and inadvertent removal of viable tissue.Accurate diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis by dynamic CT led to new approaches for management. Some surgeons recommended restricting intervention to those with documented infected necrosis, and proposed delayed exploration employing sequestrectomy and open-packing. Others advocated debridement early in the course of the disease for all patients with necrotizing pancreatitis, regardless of the status of infection. In the 1990s, however, a series of prospective studies emerged proving that nonoperative management of patients with sterile pancreatic necrosis was superior to surgical intervention, and that delayed intervention provided improved surgical mortality rates.The surgical odyssey in managing the necrotizing form of SAP, from simple drainage, to resection, to debridement, to sequestrectomy, although somewhat tortuous, is nevertheless an notable example of how evidence-based knowledge leads to improvement in patient care. Today's 10% to 20% surgical mortality rates reflect not only considerable advances in surgical management, but also highlight concomitant improvements in fluid therapy, antibiotics, and intensive care. Although history documents the important contributions that surgical practitioners have made to acute pancreatitis and its complications, surgeons are rarely complacent, and the recent emergence of minimally invasive techniques holds future promise for patients afflicted with this ""... most formidable of catastrophes."""

CD012009,0,6160076,0,"Aging changes of pancreatic isoamylases and the appearance of ""old amylase"" in the serum of patients with pancreatic pseudocysts.","Human serum and pancreatic secretions contain at least three isoamylases of pancreatic origin. As determined by gel electrophoresis and saccharogenic amylase assay, P1, P2, and P3 designate isoenzymes with slow, intermediate, and rapid electrophoretic mobilities, respectively. The P1 isoamylase normally accounts fo 80-90% of total amylase activity, P2 for 10-20%, and P3 for 0-4% in both serum and pancreatic juice. When pancreatic amylase is incubated at 37 degrees C, P1 decreases, and P2 and P3 increase within hours. Whereas P2/P1 is always < 0.25 in fresh pancreatic juice, normal serum, acute pancreatitis serum, chronic pancreatitis serum, or pancreatic cancer serum, the ratio was elevated in 11 of 12 pseudocyst contents (mean P2/P1 = 0.51) and in 14 of 16 sera from patients with proven pseudocysts (mean P2/P1 = 0.43) (P < 0.001). After pseudocysts were surgically drained, the proportions of the pancreatic isoamylases in serum reverted to normal. The precise, characteristic, and predictable changes in electrophoretic mobility, presumably a result of specific spontaneous chemical alterations of the isoenzyme molecules, allow identification of ""old amylase"" in the serum of patients with pancreatic pseudocysts. This finding may be a useful adjunct for diagnosis, but whether the amount of ""old amylase"" can be used to estimate the age of a pseudocyst is not yet known."

Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made on the ninth postoperative day and was based on clinical symptoms and an upper gastrointestinal barium study. Both serum and urine amylase values were normal. Abdominal ultrasound examination was nondiagnostic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient's clinical condition deteriorated sharply. Chest and abdominal roentgenograms revealed free intraperitoneal air, as well as air in the lesser sac. Diagnosis of a ruptured pancreatic abscess was made, and he underwent immediate exploratory laparotomy. Four liters of purulent fluid were present in the peritoneal cavity. A ruptured pancreatic abscess was found, and it had dissected above the superior mesenteric vessels and down the right gutter over the inferior vena cava.

In the Department of Surgery at Kurume University School of Medicine, 318 patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomies. The present study includes 15 of these patients, all of whom had pancreatojejunal sutural insufficiency. The frequency of sutural insufficiency was 4.7%. Five patients had bile duct cancer, 5 had cancer of the papilla of Vater, 2 had a carcinoma of the pancreatic head, 1 each had gallbladder cancer, chronic pancreatitis, and papillitis. Six (40%) of the 15 patients died during hospitalization. The presence or absence of sutural insufficiency was confirmed mainly by radiography and determining the properties and amylase levels of the drainage fluid. There was no significant difference due to the method of anastomosis. End-to-side anastomosis had a rate of 5 (5.9%) of 85 patients, while end-to-end had 10 (4.3%) of 233 patients. The sutural insufficiency was manifested as a major leakage in 6 patients and a minor leakage in 9. The degree of lymph node dissection was D0 in 6.1%, D1 in 1.4%, D2 in 4.8% and D3 in 10.8%, with a high incidence of sutural insufficiency in D3 patients. The pancreatic duct diameter was smaller than 4 mm in 10, 5-7 mm in 4 and over 8 mm in 1 patient. The intraoperative pancreatic findings were a soft pancreas in 8, slightly hard in 3, and hard in 4 patients. Fibrosis of the pancreas was normal to slight in 11 and moderate in 4 patients. Drainage by relaparotomy was performed in 4 of the 6 patients with major leakages to control sutural insufficiency, and the other 2 underwent continuous aspiration with an intraperitoneal drain inserted during the operation. The 9 patients with minor leakage underwent conservative treatment including continuous aspiration via an intraperitoneal drain inserted during surgery, fasting, intravenous hyperalimentation, and antibiotic administration. All of the patients with major leakage died from an associated occurrence of hepatic insufficiency, renal insufficiency, intraperitoneal hemorrhage or diffuse peritonitis during hospitalization. However, 8 of the 9 patients with minor leakage had some healing, and the 1 remaining patient developed a pancreatic fistula. The frequency of pancreatojejunal sutural insufficiency was high in patients with minimal pancreatic fibrosis, with soft pancreatic tissue without dilatation of the pancreatic duct, and with relatively good pancreatic function."

Hypotonic duodenography demonstrated reflux of contrast material into the choledochoduodenal fistula. The bile sample collected from the common bile duct showed extremely high levels of pancreatic enzymes, including amylase, phospholipase-A2, and elastase-I. Furthermore, Helicobacter DNA was detected in bile by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. This experience suggests to us that parapapillary choledochoduodenal fistula may be a risk factor for biliary tract carcinoma, and surgical management is the treatment of choice for this rare condition, even when the patient has no significant clinical symptoms."
CD012009,0,14699594,0,Plasmapheresis for hyperlipidemic pancreatitis.,"Patients with triglyceride levels over 1,000 mg/dl are at high risk of developing acute pancreatitis. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of plasma exchange (PE) in reducing triglyceride levels during an acute attack of hyperlipidemic pancreatitis (HLP). A total of 17 hypertriglyceridemic patients with the complication of acute pancreatitis received one course of PE treatment for one or two consecutive sessions. The respective mean removal rates during a single PE for triglyceride, cholesterol, amylase, and lipase were 66.3, 62.1, 70.0, and 84.8%, respectively. An additional one exchange increased the removal rate to 83.3, 66.2, 85.5, and 87.0%, respectively. For the two-sessions of treatment, the removal rates were higher for triglyceride (P=0.0015) and amylase with a borderline statistical significance (P=0.0641). Better triglyceride clearance correlated well with lower levels of transmembrane pressure (TMP) at 90 minutes after PE (r2=0.5782, P=0.0010) and shorter plasmapheresis duration (r2=0.2241, P=0.0427). Thirteen of seventeen patients (76.5%) recovered completely, eight patients in a single-session, and five in two-sessions. Two patients developed intra-abdominal abscess, necessitating surgical drainage and two patients died due to both septic shock and multi-organ failure. No significant predictor of clinical outcome was identified. In summary, PE treatment is an effective method to clear lipids and enzymes from plasma in a single session for most HLP patients. A greater extraction of triglyceride would result in a reduced TMP and a shorter duration of PE treatment."

CD012009,0,15868077,0,Right intrahepatic pseudocyst following acute pancreatitis: an unusual location after acute pancreatitis.,"The location of a pseudocyst (PC) in the liver is an exceptional event, and intrahepatic PCs are mainly located in the left lobe. We report here a case of right intrahepatic PC following acute pancreatitis associated with cystic (aberrant pancreatic) dystrophy of the duodenal wall (CDDW) and chronic pancreatitis. Morphological assessment (ultrasound, computed tomography [CT] scan, and cholangio-magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) revealed a 10-cm right intrahepatic collection and rupture of the main pancreatic duct. Percutaneous puncture permitted us to detect a high level of amylase in the collection, confirming the diagnosis of intrahepatic PC. Surgical drainage concomitant with pancreatico-duodenectomy for the treatment of CDDW resulted in disappearance of the collection. The mechanism involved in this patient was rupture of the pancreatic duct in the retroperitoneal cavity and erosion reaching the right hepatic parenchyma. Although intrahepatic PCs are rare, the diagnosis of intrahepatic PC complicating acute pancreatitis can be confirmed by a high level of amylase in the collection. Asymptomatic intrahepatic PCs can be treated conservatively, and symptomatic intrahepatic PCs can be managed either transcutaneously or surgically."

Both patients recovered after drainage of peripancreatic fluid collections, in the first patient by surgical followed by cutaneous drainage and in the second by cutaneous drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst. In addition to the frequent pancreatic reaction observed during asparaginase treatment, signs of pancreatic necrosis requiring urgent treatment have to be identified.

CD012009,0,11191006,0,Marked effect of octreotide acetate in a case of pancreatic pleural effusion.,"A pancreaticopleural effusion is a rare complication of chronic pancreatitis. Fasting, a protease inhibitor, and/or a surgical intervention are generally selected for the treatment of the pancreatic effusion. We reported here the case, in which octreotide acetate was effective for resolving pancreatic effusion. A 67-year-old man was admitted with a massive pleural effusion. This effusion contained a high level of amylase. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography followed by computed tomography revealed a pancreaticopleural fistula. The pleural effusion was not improved by the treatment of the protease inhibitor with total parenteral nutrition and fasting. A pancreatic stent could not be emplaced because the major pancreatic duct was coiled. Administration of octreotide acetate, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, markedly diminished the effusion and closed the pancreaticopleural fistula. Transient eosinophilia of peripheral blood was seen on admission, but the number of eosinophils decreased after the octreotide therapy and normalised when pleural effusion disappeared. Octreotide is one of the effective options for the treatment of pancreatic pleural effusion."
CD012009,0,2581338,0,Acinar structure and function in canine pancreatic autografts with duct drainage into the urinary bladder.,"Autotransplants of pancreas in 8 dogs, with exocrine drainage into the urinary bladder, were stimulated in vivo with cholecystokinin-pancreozymin (CCK-PZ). Transplant biopsies, when compared with 6 normal pancreases, showed normal acinar structure by light and electron microscopy 13-18 months after initial surgery; 2 transplants with sutures unintentionally transecting ducts were fibrosed and had duct obstruction. After in vivo stimulation, the normal-appearing transplants produced a 7-fold increase in urinary amylase, and quantitative electron microscopy showed a 50% reduction in mature zymogen granules; there were no intracellular organelle abnormalities prior or subsequent to stimulation. Fibrosed transplants produced lesser urinary amylase both prior to and after stimulation. In vitro stimulation of grafts with normal structure increased amylase secretion from 1.5-2.1-fold. In vitro dose-response showed a maximum at 10(-9)M cholecystokinin-octopeptide (CCK-OP) in transplant and control. The in vivo stimulation is more responsive and may be useful for clinical monitoring of graft survival. In vivo stimulation occurred after induced urinary tract infection; because no pancreatitis ensued, a regimen of trophic stimulation by CCK-PZ was not contraindicated. The bladder tolerated exocrine drainage with no significant change, and bladder infection did not adversely affect the transplant. The islets appeared normal in the transplants by light and qualitative electron microscopic observation; fasting blood glucose and insulin values were normal during the 12-18-month follow-up. Bladder drainage of segmental grafts of pancreas provides a preparation with intact acinar-islet relationships; the present observations suggest that this may permit longer islet survival in the absence of acinar destruction and subsequent fibrosis."
CD012009,0,2669347,0,Review of pancreatic trauma.,"In reviewing the literature on pancreatic trauma (1,984 cases), I found that it resulted from penetrating trauma in 73% and blunt trauma in 27% of cases. Associated injuries were common (average 3.0 per patient). Increased mortality was associated with shotgun wounds, an increasing number of associated injuries, the proximity of the injury to the head of the pancreas, preoperative shock, and massive hemorrhage. High mortality was found for total pancreatectomy, duct reanastomosis, and lack of surgical treatment, with lower mortality for Roux-en-Y anastomoses, suture and drainage, distal pancreatectomy, and duodenal exclusion and diverticulization techniques. Most patients required drainage only. The preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic trauma is difficult, with the diagnosis usually made during surgical repair for associated injuries. Blood studies such as amylase levels, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, and plain radiographs are not reliable. Computed tomographic scanning may be superior, but data are limited."

CD012009,0,2459789,0,Postoperative pancreatitis.,"Our experience with 52 patients who had postoperative pancreatitis develop during a nine year period was reviewed to characterize this group, to determine the incidence of complications and to identify variables predictive of complications. Biliary tract procedures (n = 10), colectomy (n = 9) and intestinal resection (n = 9) were the most frequently performed operations preceding pancreatitis. Thirty of the procedures were near the pancreas. Pancreatitis was detected within seven days of the operation in 26 of the patients. Sixteen patients had complications related to the pancreas, 12 had other nonlethal complications and nine died. Fourteen patients had severe pancreatitis (greater than or equal to 3 Ranson's criteria) and were more likely to have a complicated course (p less than 0.05). Complications related to the pancreas included pancreatic pseudocyst (n = 9), abscess (n = 4), fistula (n = 2) and arterial hemorrhage (n = 1). Age, operation performed, serum amylase level and frequency of hypotension, renal failure and other complications were similar in patients with and without complications related to the pancreas. A high index of suspicion must remain throughout the postoperative period to recognize inflammation of the pancreas and its complications so that prompt diagnosis and management can be undertaken."
CD012009,0,1259581,0,Pancreatic ascites: recognition and management.,"In a patient with chronic ascites, an abnormally raised ascitic fluid amylase concentration and a protein content above 2.5 gm/100 ml is diagnostic of pancreatic ascites. Thirty-one episodes in 26 patients treated between 1958 and 1975 have been analyzed. Twenty patients (65%) experienced abdominal pain and ten (32%) had concomitant pleural effusions roentgenographically. Although a leaking pancreatic pseudocyst was the cause of ascites in at least 21 episodes (70%), an abdominal mass could only be palpated in two of 26 patients. Roentgenographic series of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract failed to demonstrate pancreatic pseudocyst in 7 of 21 episodes (33%). Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography is invaluable in delineating the pancreatic ductal system and, in conjunction with intraoperative pancreatography, makes a vital contribution to rational surgical therapy. Medical treatment or external drainage during 18 episodes resulted in death in four (22%) and recurrences of ascites or pancreatic pseudocyst in nine (64%). Since routine pancreatography followed by pancreatic resection or internal drainage has been instituted, mortality and recurrence have been reduced to zero."

Previously, he had a history of excessive alcohol consumption and chronic epigastrium pain for 2 year. At first, he was treated as tuberculous pleural effusion according to exudative lymphocytic pleural effusion. Diagnosis was delayed because of no abdominal symptoms at the time of admission. Chronic pancreatic pleural effusion was later diagnosed by calcified pancreas and suspected pseudocyst on CT chest included upper abdomen in addition with high pleural fluid amylase. ERCP was done followed by an operation. After operative procedure of pancreatic stone removal and sump drainage, serum amylase decreased and right intercostal drainage could be removed. The overall clinical presentation was improved and he was advised to stop drinking alcohol."

CD012009,0,7738761,0,The efficacy of early ERCP in pediatric pancreatic trauma.,"Recognition of pancreatic injuries is frequently delayed, and optimal treatment is often controversial. The use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has allowed accurate delineation of pancreatic ductal injuries; however, the small size of children and the concern with inducing pancreatitis and/or lesser sac contamination have limited its use in children. In 1988, the authors began using ERCP for selected pancreatic injuries. This report describes their experience with this technique and examines the role of ERCP in pediatric pancreatic injuries. Six children with pancreatic transections resulting from blunt trauma were treated between 1988 and 1993. The age range was 2 1/2 to 8 years, and the weight range was 13.6 to 27.9 kg. The average period from injury to referral to the hospital was 14 days (range, 2 to 30 days). All six children presented with chemical evidence of pancreatitis and had an initial computed tomography (CT) scan; five scans were interpreted as being normal. Five of the six patients had subsequent CT scans, which showed lesser-sac fluid collection. Three patients were treated with drainage (2 percutaneous, 1 open [outside hospital]), and when this failed, ERCP was performed, at 13.6 days (average) after presentation. These three patients underwent ERCP relatively early in the course (an average of 3 days after presentation). All six children had major ductal transections documented through ERCP. After ERCP, the serum amylase level remained elevated in three, increased in one, and normal in one. (It was not measured in one of the recent cases taken for immediate operation.)(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Insulin response and corresponding blood sugar levels were controlled, the remaining pancreas was examined histologically. The obstruction of the pancreatic ducts by prolamine showed mainly sclerosis of the exocrine tissue whereas the duct ligation was followed by atrophy. The free intraperitoneal draining of the duct system showed both alterations, the pancreatojejunostomy did hardly impair the exocrine pancreas. According to the grade of sclerosis of the exocrine tissue, the insulin response was delayed followed by a pathologic glucose tolerance. This was shown particularly for the obstruction of the ducts by prolamine."
CD012009,0,1166332,0,Management of pancreatic ascites.,Two patients with persistent pancreatic ascites are presented. Both were managed successfully by internal drainage. A trial of nonoperative treatment with nasogastric intubation and intravenous hyperalimentation is advocated for patients with pancreatic ascites. Patients who fail to improve usually have a pancreatic duct disruption and should have internal drainage operation and/or distal pancreatic resection.
CD012009,0,937845,0,Diagnosis and management of pancreatic trauma.,The diagnosis and management of 76 patients with pancreatic trauma is reviewed. There was an overall mortality rate of 5 per cent. A preoperative serum amylase determination was a valuable parameter when assessing blunt trauma. Operative management required debridement and external drainage in approximately three-fourths of all injuries. Pancreatic resection was reserved for ductal disruption. Interruption of ductal integrity accounted for 47 per cent of all complications. Only one-third required reoperative therapy. Associated major vascular injuries accounted for all deaths.

This condition is clearly different from acute rejection on the basis of marked hyperamylasaemia and significant local findings over the allograft. Graft rejection was the cause of graft loss in one of the patients; eight are alive, seven with a functioning graft 61, 30, 27, 25, 21, 18 and 14 months after transplantation. Two patients died: one from severe graft pancreatitis and the other from cytomegalovirus infection. Bladder drainage with or without antibiotics has been the most common therapy, based on the theory that damage is caused by duodenal content and infected urine reflux. To prevent graft loss, antiviral treatment should be given when pancreatitis due to cytomegalovirus is suspected or diagnosed. Two patients with native pancreatitis are also described; the disease was severe and surgery was required in both cases. The pancreas grafts have now been functioning for 2 years 7 months and 2 years 10 months respectively."
CD012009,0,8840448,0,Sequential endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment of cholecystocholedocholithiasis.,"Preoperative common bile duct (CBD) clearance with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) is routinely performed in many centers where laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the procedure of choice for the treatment of cholelithiasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of the sequential endoscopic-laparoscopic management in patients with gallstones and suspected CBD stones. From November 1990 to May 1993, 700 consecutive patients were evaluated for LC. Preoperative workup included clinical history and physical examination; serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and amylase; and ultrasonography. Preoperative ERCP was indicated in cases with previous or present jaundice or acute pancreatitis, altered liver or pancreatic blood tests, dilated CBD (> 6 mm) and CBD stones at ultrasonography. If CDB pathology was confirmed, ES was performed and treatment attempted. All patients were assigned to undergo LC within 48 h. Morbidity, mortality, hospital stay, and disability were recorded. Of 700 patients, 49 (7%) underwent ERCP. In 26 patients (54.2%), CBD stones were identified; ES was performed and stone extraction succeeded in 22 patients (84.6%). Two patients with intrahepatic stones were successfully treated with a percutaneous transhepatic approach and then underwent surgery. Two patients with cholecystocholedochal fistula underwent open surgery. In two cases ERCP showed a papillary stenosis, which was treated with ES. Of 44 patients, 35 (79.5%) underwent LC within 48 h. The overall morbidity (ERCP/ES plus LC) was 10.4%. No mortality occurred. The mean hospital stay was 4.5 days. Return to normal activities occurred within 11 days after LC. This sequential approach resulted in a safe and effective treatment of cholecystocholedocholithiasis and a decrease in the overall costs."
CD012009,0,8486216,0,Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of refractory peripancreatic abscess associated with severe acute pancreatitis.,"Five patients with peripancreatic abscesses associated with severe acute pancreatitis were treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO). In 3 patients, the course after surgical mobilization of the pancreas and drainage of the pancreas bed was complicated by peripancreatic abscesses. HBO was conducted under a pressure of 2.8 atmospheres for two hours daily. Four of the 5 patients showed a progressive improvement in their condition. In one patient who failed to respond despite seven sessions of HBO, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the discharge, and resection of necrotic tissue and drainage were performed. The main effects of HBO were the alleviation of high spiking fever, the improvement of white blood cell count and serum amylase levels, and the reduction of the abscess size. We recognized HBO to be a successful treatment for peripancreatic abscess associated with severe acute pancreatitis and better results were obtained than in cases that did not receive HBO."

The medical records of 190 patients who underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy at the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Korea between January 2000 and December 2002 were reviewed. Patients were divided into either the octreotide (n = 81) or control group (n = 109). The octreotide group received subcutaneous injections of 100 microg of octreotide every 12 hours for more than five days after surgery. The control group was not treated with octreotide. The criterion of pancreatic fistula was the drainage of the amylase rich fluid, over 500 U/mL in the three days after surgery. The morbidity and mortality rates were 32.1% and 1.2% in the octreotide group and 31.2% and 0% in the control group, respectively. Pancreatic fistula was the second most common complication (8.4%). In the univariate analysis, octreotide was ineffective in reducing pancreatic fistula (p = 0.26). However, in the multivariate regression analysis, combined gastrectomy (p = 0.018), cellular origin of the disease (p = 0.049), and use of octreotide (p = 0.044) were the risk factors that increased the frequency of pancreatic fistula. Therefore, the routine use of octreotide after a pancreaticoduodenectomy should be avoided until a worldwide consensus is established."

CD012009,0,21107971,0,[Diagnosis and definition of anastomotic leakage from the surgeon's perspective].,"The leak rates of different gastrointestinal anastomoses vary considerably but despite this there are common and general concepts for diagnosis and management. Early diagnosis and timely consistent therapy must guide management to prevent harm to the patients. Diagnosis of anastomotic leaks is coupled to clinical signs of the patients and should be initiated promptly. Dependent on the localization of the leak, computed tomography with administration of oral or rectal contrast dye and endoscopy are of high diagnostic value. Both procedures guarantee the option of drainage or stenting through interventional drains or stent placement. Only the implementation of uniform definitions of anastomotic leaks enables surgeons to compare and to improve surgical treatment. Over recent years consensus definitions of postoperative complications including bile leak, pancreatic fistula and colorectal leak have been formulated. These definitions are based on a 3-fold increase of bilirubin (bile leak) or amylase levels (pancreatic fistula) in abdominal drainage fluid compared to serum levels or on an intestinal wall defect with communication of the intraluminal and extraluminal compartments (colorectal anastomosis). The definitions each describe three severity grades A-C. A change of clinical management is required in grade B whereas grade C usually requires a re-operation. Comparable consensus definitions for anastomotic leaks following esophagogastrostomy or esophagojejunostomy or following small bowel anastomosis have not been established. The authors strongly recommend implementation of the presented consensus definitions into clinical and academic daily practice."

In majority of cases the pancreatitis is oedematous and self-limiting. Acute haemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis caused by L-asparaginase is rare but potentially life-threatening complication. We present 2 cases of acute pancreatitis in children aged 2 and 4 years. They were diagnosed to have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and were treated according to the ALLLIC BFM 2002 protocol. Acute pancreatitis developed in these children after induction therapy and was followed by formation of a pseudocyst. In both cases the diagnosis of this complication was made directly after phase I of the protocol I (after eighth dose of L-Asparaginase). In the first case the course of acute pancreatitis was mild. Normalization of the amylase levels occurred after 7 days and the diagnosis of post inflammatory cyst was made 15 days after the first signs of the disease. But thereafter, during the additional complication (pneumonia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriemia) the pancreatic cyst became infected. In the second case acute pancreatitis had a severe course and the child required treatment in the Intensive Care Unit for 21 days. The cyst was diagnosed after 20 days from the beginning of symptoms. The surgical procedure, applied in both cases was internal drainage by anastomosis of the cyst with the back wall of the stomach. Antileukaemic treatment was recommenced after 6-8 weeks when complications resolved. Currently both children are well and remain in haematological remission and continue maintenance chemotherapy."
CD012009,0,7506011,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in biliary pancreatitis.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has emerged as the treatment of choice for uncomplicated cholelithiasis. Despite early concerns, many surgeons have applied this new technique to more complicated biliary tract disease states, including biliary pancreatitis. To evaluate the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in this setting, we retrospectively reviewed 29 patients with clinical and laboratory evidence of biliary pancreatitis who underwent this procedure between March 1990 and December 1992. The severity of pancreatitis was determined by Ranson's criteria. Two patients had a Ranson's score of 6, one of 5, one of 4, five scored 3, nine scored 2, nine also scored 1, and two patients scored 0. The mean serum amylase level on admission was 1,610 (range 148 to 7680). All patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same hospital admission for biliary pancreatitis, with the mean time of operation being 5.5 days from admission. Operative time averaged 123 minutes (range 60-220 minutes). Intraoperative cholangiography was obtained in 76 per cent of patients. Three patients had choledocholithiasis on intraoperative cholangiography and were treated with choledochoscopy, laparoscopic common bile duct exploration, and saline flushing of the duct. The mean length of hospital stay was 11 days (range 5-32 days). There were seven postoperative complications requiring prolonged hospitalization with all but one treated non-operatively. One patient with a preoperative Ranson score of 6 developed necrotizing pancreatitis and subsequently required operative pancreatic debridement and drainage. There were no deaths in this series and no postoperative wound infections. The average recovery period for return to work was 2 weeks. These statistics compare favorably with literature reports for open cholecystectomy in biliary pancreatitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Abdominal pain (68%), a mass (64%), and vomiting (52%) were the most frequent findings. The serum amylase was elevated and the upper gastrointestinal contrast study consistent with a mass in 88% of cases. Operative treatment included external drainage in 25 children (33%), cystgastrostomy or cyst-jejunostomy in 34 (45%), excision in 10 (13%) and miscellaneous procedures in 6 (8%). Complications were relatively few and there were no deaths recorded. Recurrence rate for cyst-gastrostomy was 4.7%, cyst-jejunostomy 7.6%, external drainage 8% and cyst-duodenostomy 50%. External drainage operations had prolonged cutaneous drainage. These observations suggest the appropriate operation is determined by the location and duration of pseudocyst. Internal drainage is preferred and avoids complications seen following resection and external drainage. Cyst-gastrostomy is effective when the pseudocyst is retrogastric and adherent to the stomach wall. Cyst-jejunostomy is most useful in instances in which the pseudocyst in not adherent to the stomach wall. Low recurrence rates and a zero mortality rate makes operative treatment highly acceptable therapy. Low recurrence rates are expected in childhood cases, (particularly related to trauma) due to an absence of underlying pancreatic disease and ductal obstruction."
CD012009,0,25112411,1,Low drain fluid amylase predicts absence of pancreatic fistula following pancreatectomy.,Improvements in the ability to predict pancreatic fistula could enhance patient outcomes. Previous studies demonstrate that drain fluid amylase on postoperative day 1 (DFA1) is predictive of pancreatic fistula. We sought to assess the accuracy of DFA1 and to identify a reliable DFA1 threshold under which pancreatic fistula is ruled out.
CD012009,0,8751245,0,Surgical treatment of pancreatic ascites and pancreatic pleural effusions.,Massive ascites and pleural effusions are uncommon but well-documented complications of chronic pancreatitis. The present study reviews the results of surgical management of pancreatic ascites and pleural effusions of pancreatic origin.
CD012009,0,24306817,1,Diagnostic value of abdominal drainage in individual risk assessment of pancreatic fistula following pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"The use of prophylactic abdominal drainage following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is controversial as its therapeutic value is uncertain. However, the diagnosis of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), the main cause of PD-associated morbidity, is often based on drain pancreatic amylase (DPA) levels. The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of DPA, plasma pancreatic amylase (PPA) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) for diagnosing POPF after PD."
CD012009,0,20151128,0,LigaSure for pancreatic sealing during distal pancreatectomy.,Pancreatic fistula is an unresolved problem after distal pancreatectomy. The current study investigated the safety of LigaSure for distal pancreatic resection in a porcine model.
