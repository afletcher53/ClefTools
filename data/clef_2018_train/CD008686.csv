CD008686,0,22459097,0,Anterolateral kyphoplasty in the management of cervical spinal metastasis.,"Management of spinal metastasis is still controversial and must take into account various parameters. The aim of this study is to report the technical feasibility of a less invasive anterior cervical balloon kyphoplasty for vertebral body reinforcement. Six consecutive patients with an osteolytic cervical metastasis, without neurologic compromise, and for whom a curative treatment was not indicated, were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent balloon kyphoplasty through a small anterolateral cervicotomy. Evaluation of the technique outcomes was clinical and radiologic with a systematic CT-scan. During the follow-up period (6 months average), neurologic examination was normal in all cases with reduced cervical pain and without reported loss of motion of the cervical spine. A cement leakage was noticed in two cases without clinical consequences. This less invasive procedure was feasible and provided satisfactory preliminary results. It can therefore be a valuable alternative in selected cases where a curative treatment is not indicated."
CD008686,0,22439092,0,Metastatic spinal tumor.,"In accordance with extending survival periods of cancer patients, number of consecutively developing metastatic spinal tumor is also increasing. There have been improvements in the treatment results of metastatic spine tumor by virtue of the developments in diagnostic radiology, chemotherapy, adjuvant treatment, operative device and technique, discrete preoperative plan, and standardized operation. Accordingly, surgical indication has also increased. Clinically, in case of metastatic spine tumor, treatment of tumor itself should be focused on pain relief, preservation of neurologic function, prevention of pathologic fracture, prevention of pathologic fracture, and correction of spinal instability for improving quality of life, rather than for extension of survival. Additionally, etiology of spinal tumor, correct diagnosis and subsequent treatment principles should be thoroughly understood before establishing treatment plans for effective treatments."
CD008686,0,22439091,0,Myelopathy and Quadriparesis due to Spinal Cord Compression of C1 Laminar Osteochondroma.,"The aim of this paper is to show that osteochondromas of the cervical vertebrae can cause myelopathy and neck pain.The reported etiology, diagnosis, treatment and differential diagnosis were reviewed. Osteochondromas may present as a solitary lesion with no genetic component or as multiple lesions as a part of a genetic disorder known as hereditary multiple exostosis. Osteochondromas of the spine are rarely encountered in clinical practice. These lesions are reported more commonly with neural compression in cases associated with hereditary multiple exostosis. The authors describe a unusual clinical manifestation of a solitary osteochondroma located in the right posterior arch of the atlas. Complete removal of the tumor was performed resulting in the relief of neck pain and spastic quadriparesis. Although unusual, osteochondromas of the cervical spine must be considered in patients with persistent neck pain and progressive symptoms of myelopathy. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with plain radiograms is the neuroradiological modality of choice. The diagnosis and surgical excision of these tumors are important because they can cause spinal stenosis resulting in neural tissue compression and myelopathy."

CD008686,0,22431937,0,A rare cause of low back pain: report of a tailgut cyst.,"Tailgut cysts, also known as retrorectal cystic hamartomas, are rare developmental abnormalities that typically occur in the retrorectal space. They are believed to arise from remnants of the embryonic hindgut (Hjermstad and Helwig, 1988). They can present as incidental findings during routine examination but over half of patients are thought to present with symptoms. MRI has become the modality of choice to image these frequently misdiagnosed cysts. Biopsy is not recommended. Complete intact surgical excision is advised to avoid the potential complications of these cysts which include infection, fistula formation, and the possibility of malignant transformation (Hjermstad and Helwig (1988), Mathis et al. (2010)). We describe the case of a 46-year-old female who presented with a 6-month history of low back pain. CT and MRI imaging demonstrated a complex retrorectal lesion with supralevator and infralevator components. This was removed using a combined transperineal and transabdominal approach. Histology confirmed a tailgut cyst."

We present clinical, radiologic profile and treatment outcome of 15 spinal PNET patients from June 2003 to March 2010 treated with chemoradiotherapy. Median duration of backache was 6.5 months; all had features of myelopathy and/or radiculopathy; 5/15 (33.3%) patients were diagnosed initially as spinal tuberculosis. The event-free survival (EFS) was 24.73% at a median follow-up of 22 months. Complete functional recovery to treatment significantly predicted better EFS; 4 patients discontinued treatment because of poor functional recovery. It is important to recognize spinal PNET early to prevent permanent neurological damage, which in turn would improve compliance, quality of life, and perhaps EFS."

CD008686,0,22417981,0,A review of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic and malignant vertebral compression fractures.,"Vertebral compression fractures are a common clinical problem and the incidence of them will increase with the ageing population. Traditionally management has been conservative; however, there has been a growing trend towards vertebroplasty as an alternative therapy in patients with persisting severe pain. NICE produced guidance in 2003 recommending the procedure after 4 weeks of conservative management. Recent high-quality studies have been contradictory and there is currently a debate surrounding the role of the procedure with no agreement in the literature. We examine the evidence in both osteoporotic and malignant vertebral compression fractures; we also describe the benefits and side effects, alternative treatment options and the cost of the procedure. Finally, we recommend when vertebroplasty is most appropriately used based on the best available evidence."

CD008686,0,22405461,0,"Tropical spastic paraparesis and HTLV-1 associated myelopathy: clinical, epidemiological, virological and therapeutic aspects.","In 1980, Human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was the first oncogenic human retrovirus to be discovered. HTLV-1 belongs to the Retroviridae family, the Orthoretrovirinae subfamily and to the deltaretrovirus genus. HTLV-1 preferentially infects CD4(+) lymphoid cells in vivo. Three molecules have been identified for binding and/or entry of HTLV-1: heparan sulfate proteoglycans, neuropilin-1, and glucose transporter 1. An efficient transfer of the virus from an infected cell to a target cell can occur through the formation of a viral synapse and/or by virofilm structure. As for all retroviruses, HTLV-1 genome possesses three major ORFs (gag, pol and env) encoding the structural and enzymatic proteins. HTLV-1 encodes also some regulatory and auxillary proteins including the tax protein with transforming activities and the HBZ protein which plays a role in the proliferation and maintenance of the leukemic cells. HTLV-1 is present throughout the world with clusters of high endemicity including mainly Southern Japan, the Caribbean region, areas in South America and in intertropical Africa. The worldwide HTLV-1 infected population is estimated to be around 10-20 million. HTLV-1 has three modes of transmission: (1): mother to child, mainly linked to prolonged breast-feeding; (2): sexual, mainly occurring from male to female and (3): contaminated blood products. HTLV-1 possesses a remarkable genetic stability. HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of mainly two severe diseases: a malignant T CD4(+) cell lymphoproliferation, of very poor prognosis, named Adult T cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL), and a chronic neuro-myelopathy named Tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy (TSP/HAM). The lifetime risk among HTLV-1 carriers is estimated to be around 0.25 to 3%. TSP/HAM mainly occurs in adults, with a mean age at onset of 40-50 years and it is more common in women than in men. Blood transfusion is a major risk factor for TSP/HAM development. Clinically, TSP/HAM is mainly defined as a chronic spastic paraparesis and minor sensory signs. The onset is insidious with often gait disturbance and urinary symptoms. In more than 90% of the cases, the neurological features involve: spasticity and/or hyperreflexia of the lower extremities, urinary bladder disturbance, lower extremity muscle weakness, and in around 50% of the cases, sensory disturbances with low back pain. Central functions and cranial nerves are usually spared. The clinical course is generally progressive without remission. High levels of antibodies titers directed against HTLV-1 antigens are present in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A high HTLV-1 proviral load is frequently observed in the blood. Mild to moderate increase of proteins may be present in the CSF. However, intrathecal production of specific HTLV-1 antibody index provides additional data to support the diagnosis. Brain white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging are frequent. A mild atrophy of the thoracic spinal cord can also be observed. Pathologically, it is characterized by a chronic inflammation with perivascular lymphocytic cuffing and mild parenchymal lymphocytic infiltrates. The cells are mostly CD4(+) in early disease and mostly CD8(+) in latter disease. Pyramidal tract damage with myelin and axonal loss, mainly in the lower thoracic spinal cord are observed. TSP/HAM pathogenesis is still poorly understood and viral and host factors as the proviral load and the cellular immune response play a major role in disease progression. TSP/HAM can be associated with other HTLV-1 associated symptoms (uveitis, myositis, infective dermatitis). Therapy of TSP/HAM remains disappointing and symptomatic treatment remains still the mainstay of therapy."

CD008686,0,22400081,0,Cutaneous metastasis of renal cell carcinoma: a report of two cases.,"Cutaneous metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is very rare. The author herein report two cases of RCC with cutaneous metastasis. Case 1: is a 75-year-old man with right lumbago. Imaging modalities including CT and MRI revealed a right renal tumor. Nephrectomy was performed. Pathological diagnosis of the renal tumor was RCC of clear cell type (Fuhrman's grade II). He denied follow-up. Nine years later, he (at the age of 84 years), a neck skin tumor emerged. Clinical diagnosis was hemangioma. Imaging modalities including CT and MRI showed several tumors in both lungs. The resection of the neck tumor was performed. The tumor was composed of clear cell type arranged in a trabecular pattern. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for pancytokeratins, cytokeratin 18, CD10, Ki-67 (labeling=13%), but negative for CD34, factor-VIII-related antigen, CEA, EMA, melanosome (HMB45), S100 protein, p53, and HepPar-1. Metastatic RCC was diagnosed. Despite interferon therapy, he died of 6 months after the second admission. Case 2 is a 66-year-old man with gross hematuria. Imaging modalities revealed left renal tumor. A nephrectomy was performed. The pathological diagnosis was RCC of clear cell type (grade II). The tumor was invasive into the renal pelvis. He was treated by chemoradiation, but metastases of lungs, skin (thigh), and lib emerged, and died of cachexia 9 months after the admission. Necropsy of the skin tumor was performed. The skin tumor was composed of clear cells arranged in a trabecular pattern. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for pancytokeratins (AE1/3, CAM5.2), CD10, p53, and Ki-67 (labeling=20%), but negative for CD34, factor-VIII-related antigen, CEA, melanosome (HMB45), S100 protein, and HepPar-1. A diagnosis of RCC (grade II) was diagnosed."

CD008686,0,22386901,0,Combined open decompressive laminectomy and vertebroplasty for treatment of thoracolumbar fractures retrospective review of 41 cases.,"Vertebral compression fractures are common, and can occur concomitantly in patients with symptomatic degenerative stenosis. Less commonly, complicated vertebral body fractures may involve retropulsion of bone into the spinal canal, resulting in stenosis with myelopathy and/or radiculopathy. Decompression of the neural elements can lead to destabilization and progressive kyphotic deformity. Laminectomy combined with open vertebroplasty provides a way to decompress the neural elements and stabilize the anterior columns in patients who cannot tolerate extended surgical time or complications associated with instrumentation and fusion. The authors describe the combination of decompressive laminectomy and open transpedicular vertebroplasty as a means to decompress neural elements and simultaneously stabilize the anterior vertebral column."
CD008686,0,22386658,0,Clinical course of incidental syringomyelia without predisposing pathologies.,"Although the widespread use of MRI has facilitated the diagnosis of subclinical syringomyelia, little information has been established regarding its natural course. To elucidate the clinical course and treatment strategy of incidental syringomyelia without predisposing pathologies, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 12 adult patients with incidental syringomyelia. No patients had any predisposing pathology, including Chiari malformation or spinal cord tumor. Using the medical records and MRI, we analyzed the neurological and radiological features of each patient. After a mean of 39.9 months follow-up, no patient developed neurological deterioration. Although one patient had radiological progression without neurological deterioration, 11 patients (91.7%) had no change on MRI. Additionally, all patients experienced a favorable clinical course without surgery. These results indicate that, for patients with incidental syringomyelia without predisposing pathology, close observation rather than surgery can be recommended."
CD008686,0,22385767,0,Peritoneal metastases of medulloblastoma due to placement of ventriculoperitoneal shunt in an adult patient.,"Medulloblastoma is a highly aggressive tumor of the posterior fossa. It is more common in children and has a very low incidence in adults. This tumor may cause endocranial hypertension, which requires placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt after surgical resection. It is possible, however, that neoplastic cells found in the cerebral spinal fluid can migrate through the shunt and implant themselves into the peritoneal cavity, producing multiple metastases that create great difficulty in treatment and offer a poor prognosis. This event is extraordinarily rare, which explains the few published cases and the lack of guidelines for treatment."
CD008686,0,22385464,0,Giant cell tumor expanded into the thoracic cavity with spinal involvement.,"This article describes a case of a giant cell tumor that expanded into the thoracic cavity and through the spinal canal into the vertebrae. A 36-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of back pain and dyspnea. Plain chest radiographs showed a huge mass accompanied by right pleural effusion. The mass involved the 12th thoracic spine, and the spinal cord was severely compressed. The tumor was resected with a 2-stage procedure. As a first stage to separate the tumor from the anterior vital structures under direct vision, thoracic surgeons performed a right thoracotomy with chest wall reconstruction from the 8th to 11th ribs. The right lung and inferior vena cava were gently retracted, and the tumor was carefully detached from these structures. We were not able to separate the tumor from the right diaphragm due to severe invasion; therefore, we performed partial resection of the right diaphragm with the tumor. After excision of the anterior part of the tumor, the thoracic wall was reconstructed with the right eighth rib and Marlex mesh. When the patient's general condition improved 2 weeks later, spondylectomy by posterior approach was performed. We achieved excision of a giant cell tumor that had expanded into the thoracic cavity and through the spinal canal into the vertebrae. The patient had achieved full rehabilitation with no neurological or respiratory abnormalities at 7 years postoperatively."
CD008686,0,22356219,0,Heterogeneity of chronic pain.,"Chronic pain is a widespread public health issue that has many effects on physical, emotional and cognitive functions. An estimated 10-55% of all adults are thought to have chronic pain. Chronic pain is a multifactorial condition, caused by the complex interplay of nociceptive, neuropathic or mixed pathogenic mechanisms. Chronic pain is associated with specific and non-specific medical conditions such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, low back pain or spinal stenosis and is broadly categorized as cancer pain and non-cancer pain. Evaluation of chronic pain requires a clear understanding of the nature of the pain and its underlying pathophysiology. Adequate assessment of pain, using validated tools, is an essential prerequisite of successful pain management. Unidimensional scales are useful for the measurement of pain intensity, while multidimensional scales measure both pain intensity and the extent to which pain interferes with life activity and emotional functioning. Patients should be reassessed and followed up in order to monitor progress and measure improvements in pain."
CD008686,0,22382854,0,Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis in a breast cancer patient: report of a case.,"We herein report a rare case of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO) coexisting with breast carcinoma. A 71-year-old female presented with neck pain without fever. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed suspected metastatic lesions in her neck (C7 and Th1). Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed increased FDG uptake in the neck spines and in the left breast. A core needle biopsy of the left breast revealed the presence of invasive ductal carcinoma. Our first tentative diagnosis of the patient was left breast carcinoma with bone metastases, and first-line endocrine therapy was started. However, surgical intervention for the spines had to be considered, because her neurological symptoms progressed. A repeated MRI scan showed a narrowing of the disc space and fluid accumulation around the vertebrae. This suggested the presence of PVO rather than metastases. Surgery confirmed the presence of PVO in C7 and Th1, and a culture of the abscess yielded Escherichia coli. The patient's neurological symptoms dramatically improved after surgery. Breast conserving surgery was performed 3 months after the surgery for PVO. The patient is well and has no clinical evidence of disease 18 months after the breast conserving surgery. PVO is rare, but should be included in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with early breast carcinoma."

CD008686,0,22335411,0,Three-dimensional C-arm computed tomography combined with fluoroscopic guided pediculoplasty for treatment of vertebral body metastasis with lytic pedicle.,"The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate a percutaneous pediculoplasty (PP) technique, using 3-dimensional C-arm CT reformation combined with fluoroscopic guidance for patients presented vertebral body metastasis with lytic pedicle. Thirteen patients (average age 57.8 years) were treated through lytic pedicle approach in our study. Subjective good and partial pain relief was reported with Visual Analogue Scale reduction ≥ 4 in 11/13 patients at 1 month after procedure, two patients with insufficient pain relief died from clinical complications unrelated with PP at 3 month follow-up. Pain relief was maintained in 10 patients at 6 month post-procedural follow-up. One patient died from underlying disease unrelated with the procedure at 5 month follow-up. PP through the lytic pedicle approach under 3-dimensional C-arm CT reformation combined with fluoroscopic guidance was a feasible, safe, and minimally invasive procedure that could provide both the precise control of needle placement and cement injection with one imaging system."
CD008686,0,22335404,0,Comparison of whole versus partial vertebral body stereotactic body radiation therapy for spinal metastases.,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference in clinical outcomes for patients with metastatic spine disease treated with a whole versus partial vertebral body contouring approach. A retrospective study was performed for the clinical outcomes of 154 metastatic lesions to the spine in 117 patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) using the Cyberknife(TM) Robotic Radiosurgery System. Each patient was treated with a single session of radiotherapy using either a whole (WB) or a partial vertebral body contour approach (PB). The primary endpoint was re-treatment rate and the secondary endpoints were pain status, neurologic status, toxicity, tumor control, and survival. The WB group had a lower re-treatment rate (11% (WB) vs. 18.6% (PB), p=0.285). Prior surgery status (β=1.953, OR=7.052, p<0.001) was correlated to the re-treatment rate. Trends for local tumor control were distinct for both treatment groups (X(2)=3.380, p-value=0.066). Treatment group (β=-1.1017, OR=0.362, p=0.029) was significantly correlated to the local tumor control rate. The 2-year survival was 25.7% in WB and 20.9% in PB (p=0.741). Contouring the whole vertebral body for stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment of metastatic spinal lesions shows potential benefits by reducing the risk of recurrence, improving symptomatic relief and providing improved local tumor control."
CD008686,0,22335313,0,Diagnosis and treatment of acute low back pain.,"Acute low back pain is one of the most common reasons for adults to see a family physician. Although most patients recover quickly with minimal treatment, proper evaluation is imperative to identify rare cases of serious underlying pathology. Certain red flags should prompt aggressive treatment or referral to a spine specialist, whereas others are less concerning. Serious red flags include significant trauma related to age (i.e., injury related to a fall from a height or motor vehicle crash in a young patient, or from a minor fall or heavy lifting in a patient with osteoporosis or possible osteoporosis), major or progressive motor or sensory deficit, new-onset bowel or bladder incontinence or urinary retention, loss of anal sphincter tone, saddle anesthesia, history of cancer metastatic to bone, and suspected spinal infection. Without clinical signs of serious pathology, diagnostic imaging and laboratory testing often are not required. Although there are numerous treatments for nonspecific acute low back pain, most have little evidence of benefit. Patient education and medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants are beneficial. Bed rest should be avoided if possible. Exercises directed by a physical therapist, such as the McKenzie method and spine stabilization exercises, may decrease recurrent pain and need for health care services. Spinal manipulation and chiropractic techniques are no more effective than established medical treatments, and adding them to established treatments does not improve outcomes. No substantial benefit has been shown with oral steroids, acupuncture, massage, traction, lumbar supports, or regular exercise programs."

CD008686,0,22314480,0,Von Hippel-Lindau disease in a pregnant lady.,"Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by various tumours and cysts in the central nervous system and other viscera. Here a case was described in a young female who was pregnant at the time of initial presentation with the complaints of occasional headache, low back pain and pain in the upper abdomen. After the birth of a healthy baby she was admitted to the hospital and the CT scan of upper abdomen suggested a multiloculated pancreatic cyst. MRI of thoracolumbar spine revealed an intracanalicular extradural mass and CT scan of brain revealed a cerebellar cystic mass. The spinal and cerebellar masses both were diagnosed histologically as haemangioblastoma. After a month she underwent laparotomy with near total pancreatectomy. Microscopically it was a microcystic cystadenoma. Based on the clinical presentation, imaging and histopathology of spinal, cerebellar and pancreatic lesions as well as a family history of her father's death due to brain tumour the final diagnosis was Von Hippel-Lindau disease."

Inspection time, a measure of the efficiency of visual information processing, was evaluated, and its usefulness in patients with intracranial tumors was compared with that of other widely used cognitive tests. Newly presenting inpatients with supratentorial intracranial tumors (n = 118) underwent preoperative assessment using inspection time and a number of other measures of cognitive function, mood, and functional status. The brain tumor cohort was compared with patients admitted for elective spinal surgery (n = 85) and a healthy control group (n = 80). Analysis of covariance was used to compare the performance of the 3 groups. The brain tumor cohort had significantly lower inspection time scores than the spinal surgery group (P = .005) and the healthy volunteer control group (P < .001). The effect size was moderate. There was a large effect size of participant group for the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Digit Symbol-Coding, and Verbal Fluency (P = .002). The performance of patients with brain tumors was significantly worse than that of both of the control groups. Inspection time was well-tolerated by patients with intracranial tumors. However, inspection time is neither as easy to perform nor as sensitive as some other measures of cognitive function. Although its lack of any motor speed or coordination requirements, conceptual simplicity, repeatability, and relative lack of learning effect make inspection time a potentially useful tool in clinical neuro-oncology, practical considerations will limit its use."

A 41-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of dyspnea, fever and significant chest pain associated with night sweats and weight loss. The physical examination disclosed a firm painful paravertebral mass. The chest radiograph demonstrated a left apical opacity. The thoracic scan showed parenchymal infiltration of the apico-dorsal segment of the left upper lobe with vertebral and costal lytic lesions. Surgical biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation with giant-cell intracytoplasmic inclusions. Fungal studies yielded Blastomyces dermatitidis which responded excellently to ketoconazole. Outcome has been excellent at 3.5 years months follow-up. The clinical and radiographic presentation of blastomycosis is non-specific and can be mistaken for a neoplasm.

Symptoms may vary from simple vertebral pain, sometimes resistant to conservative medical treatment, to progressive neurological deficit. Surgery or radiotherapy have been the treatment of choice for several years, but they were worsened by intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhagic complications related to the rich vascularization that characterize these kinds of lesions, often preceded by a preoperative embolization in the acute setting. Recently, a percutaneous, minimally invasive technique of vertebroplasty has been introduced into clinical practice as an alternative to traditional surgical and radiotherapy treatment of symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas with or without features of aggressiveness at imaging studies."

CD008686,0,22268312,0,Neurological complications in HIV.,"HIV is neuroinvasive with early involvement of the nervous system and has the potential to cause disease at any site of the neuro-axis during the evolution from seroconversion to late stage HIV. Disease may result from direct viral infection, indirect immune-deficiency driven opportunistic infections, AIDS-defining cancers, antiretroviral (ARV) drug therapy, or less well elucidated associations, such as vascular events (Table 1). Recognition of each of these is paramount in the prevention or attenuation of long-term morbidity. Though the epidemiology of neurological disease has altered substantially since the arrival of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), with reduced incidence and improved survival, the spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) diseases has remained relatively unchanged. Despite available treatment options, mortality remains high and the morbidity significant. CNS diseases can result in long hospital stays, reduced quality of life and marked disability. The majority of disease occurs in the advanced stages of HIV infection where immunosuppression is the predominant influence. Diagnosis can prove challenging as presentation is often atypical and there can be significant neurological involvement with limited evidence of disease. Multiple aetiologies can co-exist and investigations may yield unexpected results, rendering interpretation difficult. Paradoxically, cART may also alter the way CNS disease manifests and unmask opportunistic infections or cause clinical representation of the opportunistic infections, when it represents immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS). Clinical assessment, imaging (typically magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) sampling remain the chief diagnostic tools. This conference summary reviews these differing aspects."
CD008686,0,22265264,0,Spondyloarthritides.,"The most important clinical features of the spondyloarthritides (SpA) are not only inflammatory back pain (IBP) but also peripheral (enthesitis) and extra-articular symptoms. For clinical purposes, two forms related to the predominant clinical manifestation - axial and peripheral SpA - and five subgroups- ankylosing spondylitis (AS), SpA associated with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), reactive arthritis and undifferentiated SpA - are differentiated. Axial SpA including AS is the most frequent subtype of SpA, followed by psoriatic arthritis and undifferentiated SpA, while reactive arthritis and IBD-related SpA are less frequent. The prevalence of SpA has been shown to be similar to rheumatoid arthritis. The outcome of the disease is influenced by the degree of disease activity over time, which is mainly related not only to inflammation but also on the structural damage (new bone formation) that occurs over time. Treatment options for patients with SpA have been limited for decades. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are currently considered first choice, since they have shown good amelioration of symptoms in SpA patients especially when suffering by the typical symptom of IBP. Furthermore, there is a clear role for regular physiotherapy in AS to prevent loss of spinal mobility. For patients who have insufficiently responded to conventional therapies, four anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents are available and are approved for the treatment of patients with active AS: infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab and golimumab. As far as it stands now, TNF blockers seem to have no influence on new bone formation in AS."

However, in the story of the management of tumours involving the spinal cord, there is no doubt at all about priority; the surgeon was Victor Horsley and the date was June 1887! The patient was a Captain Gilbey, a business man and a retired Army officer. In 1884, shortly after his wife's death following a road traffic accident, he developed severe upper thoracic back pain. He was seen over succeeding months and years by numbers of specialists, whose diagnoses ranged from an aneurysm to neurasthenia, and whose treatments included advice to take a long sea voyage, to have Turkish baths and to take the cure at the medicinal baths at Aix-la-Chapelle. His various medical advisors thought his condition to be functional, even though he was gradually losing sensation and movement in his legs and trunk, was having considerable difficulty in passing his urine and was now requiring morphia for the pain."

We report a case of a 25-year-old man with back pain and bilateral progressive weakness of the lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a markedly enhanced dumbbell-shaped mass at the T7 level. The lesion was intradurally located at the left side of the spinal cord, and extended extradurally to the extraforminal space through the T7-8 intervertebral foramen. The tumor was completely excised through a posterior approach. Microscopic examination and immunohistochemical studies confirmed mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Postoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy were also performed to prevent local recurrence and metastasis. The patient has been symptom-free for two years after surgery. Herein, we reviewed and discussed the clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of primary intraspinal mesenchymal chondrosarcomas in the literature."

CD008686,0,22246201,0,Stereotactic radiosurgery for primary and metastatic sarcomas involving the spine.,"The treatment for spinal sarcomas is difficult due to inadequate surgical margin and an inability to deliver high dose radiation. Advanced technology of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) enabled higher biological effective doses of radiation to be delivered to spinal sarcomas by hypofractionation method. The authors evaluated local control rate following SRS for primary and metastatic spinal sarcomas. Thirty-two spinal sarcomas (10 primary tumors, 22 metastatic tumors) in 27 patients were treated by SRS from November 2002 to September 2009. Patients were assessed for pain status, neurological status and radiological response by regular follow-up. Overall survival and local progression-free survival were calculated and prognostic factors were sought. Median tumor volume was 18.6 ml. Radiation doses to the tumor margins ranged from 16 to 45 Gy in one to three fractions, and the median single session equivalent dose was 21.8 Gy. Follow-up ranged from 4 to 68 months (median, 22 months). Overall median survival was 29 months and no related prognostic factors were identified. During follow-up, pain was controlled in 89.3% (25/28) lesions at 6 months, in 68.2% (15/22) at 1 year, and in 61.5% (8/13) at 2 years. Tumor volume was found to be significantly related to post-SRS pain control rate. Radiological evaluation showed that local control was maintained in 96.7% (29/30) lesions at 6 months, in 78.3% (18/23) at 1 year, and in 76.9% (10/13) at 2 years. Radiation dose and tumor volume were found to be related to radiological control at 24 months following SRS. Nine cases developed recurrence between 2 and 33 months, median local progression-free survival was 23 months. Age was found to be predictive of local progression-free survival (P = 0.009). SRS proved to be an effective modality for the local control of primary and metastatic spinal sarcomas, and age was significantly related to local recurrence."
CD008686,0,22238045,0,Managing chronic pain with spinal cord stimulation.,"Since its introduction as a procedure of last resort in a terminally ill patient with intractable cancer-related pain, spinal cord stimulation has been used to effectively treat chronic pain of varied origins. Spinal cord stimulation is commonly used for control of pain secondary to failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome, as well as pain from angina pectoris, peripheral vascular disease, and other causes. By stimulating one or more electrodes implanted in the posterior epidural space, the patient feels paresthesias in their areas of pain, which reduces the level of pain. Pain is reduced without the side effects associated with analgesic medications. Patients have improved quality of life and improved function, with many returning to work. Spinal cord stimulation has been shown to be cost effective as compared with conservative management alone. There is strong evidence for efficacy and cost effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation in the treatment of pain associated with intractable angina, failed back surgery syndrome, and complex regional pain syndrome. In this article, we review the history and pathophysiology of spinal cord stimulation, and the evidence (or lack thereof) for efficacy in common clinical practice."

CD008686,0,22232957,0,[Low back pain vs. leg dominant pain].,"There are two patterns of back pain: 1) back-dominant pain and 2) leg pain dominant, greater than back pain. The causes of back pain are very different and numerous, but mostly are due to vertebral, mechanical etiology, and rarely because of non vertebral, visceral etiology. Leg pain greater than back pain is mostly disease of spinal nerve root, generally presented by radicular pain in a dermatomal distribution. Mechanical compression of spinal roots, caused by disc herniation or by spinal stenosis, results in radicular symptoms. Rarely, in about 1% of patients, there are some other reasons except vertebral mechanical cause, like infection, tumor or fracture. There are several causes of pseudoradicular pain like periferal neuropathy, myifascial syndromes, vascular diseases, osteoarthritis. Spondylarthropathies should be taken in cosideration as well. A complete history and physical examination is important to determine further diagnostic evaluation and to provide eficient therapy."

CD008686,0,22225487,0,Primary telangiectatic osteosarcoma of the cervical spine.,"Telangiectatic osteosarcoma (TOS) is one of the 8 subtypes of osteosarcoma that infrequently affects the spine. The radiopathological features of TOS overlap with those of more benign entities, most commonly the aneurysmal bone cyst), and therefore is a significant diagnostic challenge. It is a rare but well-described entity in the thoracolumbar and sacral spine, and to the authors' knowledge has not been previously reported in the cervical spine. The authors report the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented with a 6-month history of neck pain and torticollis. He underwent preoperative glue embolization followed by a staged subtotal C-5 spondylectomy and posterior fusion for a C-5 vertebral body lytic expansile lesion. Histopathological examination showed the lesion to be TOS. The surgery was followed by adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy with a favorable outcome at the 1-year follow-up. This report reiterates that TOS is an important differential diagnosis for aneurysmal bone cyst and giant-cell tumor of the spine, as its biological behavior and clinical outcome differ from those of these more benign lesions, which it mimics."

CD008686,0,22181328,0,Radiosurgery of spinal meningiomas and schwannomas.,"Purpose of this study is to analyze local control, clinical symptoms and toxicity after image-guided radiosurgery of spinal meningiomas and schwannomas. Standard treatment of benign spinal lesions is microsurgical resection. While a few publications have reported about radiosurgery for benign spinal lesions, this is the first study analyzing the outcome of robotic radiosurgery for benign spinal tumors, treated exclusively with a non-invasive, fiducial free, single-fraction setup. Thirty-six patients with spinal meningiomas or schwannomas were treated, utilizing a robotic radiosurgery system (CyberKnife®, Accuray Inc. Sunnyvale CA), and were followed prospectively. Medical history, histology, clinical symptoms and radiographic outcome were recorded. Thirty-nine spinal lesions were treated because of tumor recurrence, remnants after microsurgery, multiple lesions, or rejection of open surgery. Median age was 45 years (range 18-80 years). Median target volume was 3.4 cm(3) (range 0.2-43.4 cm(3)). Histology revealed 28 schwannomas and 11 meningiomas (WHO grade I). All spinal levels were affected. Median prescription dose was 14 Gray (95% C.I. 13.4-14 Gy) to the 70% isodose. After a median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-50 months) no local tumor progression was detected. 20 lesions (51%) remained stable, 19 tumors (49%) decreased in size. One patient with schwannomatosis was treated repeatedly for three new tumor locations. Pain was the initial symptom in 16 of 25 schwannoma patients, and in 3 of 11 patients with meningiomas. Pain levels decreased in 8/19 patients. All but one patient with motor deficits remained clinically stable. No myelopathic signs where found. Single-session radiosurgery for benign spinal tumors in selected patients has proven to inhibit tumor progression within the observed period without signs of early toxicity. Radiosurgery offers an additional treatment option, if microsurgery is not feasible in cases of tumor recurrence, post-resection remnants, multiple lesions, or medical comorbidity."

This study was performed as a retrospective review of the first ten consecutive patients treated with this combined approach. The MASS technique was based on a tubular retraction system to gain access for decompression and mechanical stabilization achieved using methyl-methacrylate (MMA) applied under direct visualization. SBRT consisted of one to five image-guided high dose per fraction treatments. Eight patients were symptomatic at baseline. Pain, disability, and quality of life (QOL) were prospectively determined using the visual analogue score (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Short-Form-36 version 2, respectively. The median follow-up was 13 months (range, 3-18). MASS successfully decompressed each patient. The median blood loss was 335 ml. Following MASS, the median time to SBRT treatment planning was 6.5 days and subsequent median time to treatment was 7 days. Local control was observed in 7 of the 10 patients. Improvements in VAS, ODI and QOL were observed post-SBRT. We report preliminary efficacy for our MASS-SBRT combined approach for patients with spinal metastases, mechanical pain and epidural disease."

This region has unique anatomic and oncologic properties. The cytopathologic files at The Johns Hopkins Hospital over a 20-year-period were searched. Imaging studies and medical records were also reviewed. Ninety-one cases of sacral/presacral FNA were identified. There were 46 males and 45 females; 62% had a prior history of malignancy. The most common presentation was lower back pain (44%). Imaging revealed lytic and/or soft tissue lesions masses from 1 to 12 cm (mean = 5.0 cm). Of the 71 (78%) diagnostic cases, 19 (27%) were nonneoplastic, 2 (3%) were suspicious for neoplasm, while 50 (70%) cases were neoplastic. Of the nonneoplastic cases, 10 (53%) showed nonspecific inflammation. Two (4%) of the 50 neoplastic lesions were benign tumors (schwannoma and neurofibroma), and of the malignant cases, 11 (23%) were primary, and 37 (77%) were metastatic/secondary. The most common primary malignant tumor was chordoma (four cases, 36%). Of the 37 secondary tumors, the most common were colorectal carcinoma (8, 22%) and plasmacytic tumors (5/9, 56%). The overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of FNA were 96, 95, and 100%, respectively. Sacral and presacral lesions represent rare targets for FNA. Benign tumors are rare (2%). Most cancers are metastatic (41%), with colorectum being the most common primary site (9%). Primary malignancies are uncommon (14%), with chordomas being the most frequent of these entities (4%)."

The follow-up period ranged from 1 year and 6 months to 1 year and 8 months. The neurological deficit due to thoracic meningioma after surgery for lumbar canal stensois was decreased after mass excision. So, careful physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging can reveal another thoracic spine compressive lesion such as meningioma. Additional thoracic decompressive surgery can provide partial amelioration of each patient's neurological condition.

The patient first presented in 2003 with 9 months of vomiting and a 9-kg weight loss. A head MRI showed a heterogeneously enhancing posterior fossa mass with hydrocephalus. Gross total resection was performed and the tumor was consistent with a classic medulloblastoma. Postoperative chemotherapy and craniospinal radiation was administered. The patient remained tumor-free until 2008, at which time he presented with right-sided weakness and numbness, left eye pain, vomiting and weight loss. Imaging showed abnormalities within the posterior pons, medulla, inferior cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar hemispheres and cervicomedullary junction with expansion of the medulla and cervical spinal cord. Due to the location of the lesion, biopsy was felt to be too risky and was avoided. Despite receiving chemotherapy, his symptoms continued to worsen and he died 4 months later. Post mortem examination limited to the brain and spinal cord confirmed the radiographic extent of the tumor. Microscopic examination showed a highly cellular infiltrative glial neoplasm with extensive palisading necrosis. A diagnosis of glioblastoma was rendered. The question of whether the first and second tumors were related is of potential clinical and academic interest. The first tumor was synaptophysin-positive and GFAP-negative, consistent with medulloblastoma. The second tumor was synaptophysin-negative and focally GFAP-positive, consistent with glioblastoma. The glioblastoma displayed EGF receptor amplification, and interestingly, it also displayed MYCN amplification; both tumors showed low level PTEN deletion. The medulloblastoma displayed a signal pattern consistent with an isochromosome 17q, while the glioblastoma showed some cells with an isochromosome 17q signal pattern amid a background of cells with abundant chromosomal instability. The relationship between these two tumors, particularly with regard to various molecular events, is discussed."

A rapid and effective treatment of pain and appropriate analgesia can prevent patients from being traumatized.For severe pain, malignancy- or chemotherapy-induced (eg. mucositis WHO grade 3 and 4) initial use of strong opiates is recommended instead of climbing the WHO ladder. For strong opiates, there is no maximum dose, as long as a dose increase leads to clinically observable increase in analgesia, without severe side effects. Patient-controlled analgesia with morphine as continuous subcutaneous or intravenous infusions and the possibility of a bolus injection is suited for children aged 6 years. A measurement of O2-saturation is essential during this infusion. Prophylactic approaches also must be used consistently in regard to the acute side effect of opiate treatment. Good experience, we have also made a non-drug therapy, e.g. personnel/physical affection, cuddling, massage, etc.The choice of analgesia depends on the nature and cause of pain. In neuropathic pain or phantom pain coanalgetics should be used to effectively treat pain in young patients. Different analgesic treatment approaches of the appropriate indications and adverse effects are presented. A particular challenge for the pediatrician is the sufficient and adequate pain therapy in palliative care."

Here, a 22-year-old man, with underlying AML (M2-Subtype, FAB classification) and cytogenetic analysis resulted in 45, x, -y, t(8;21) (q22;q22)[15] whose presenting symptoms of low back pain and incontinence, 10 months after first remission, was reported. This was followed by peripheral and bone marrow relapse. The magnetic resonance image (MRI) findings revealed leukemic infiltration at S1-S5 of the spinal cord canal with associated soft tissue component at presacral area encasing bilateral S1-S5 exiting root with heterogeneous enhancement in bone marrow of S2-S4. The therapeutic and prognosis implications of spinal cord involvement by leukemia were discussed. Because of severe morbidity, the patient developed bone marrow failure and died from sepsis."
CD008686,0,22144222,0,Late diagnosis of type 2B multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN 2B) in a 23 year-old patient.,"We present a case of MEN 2B diagnosed in a 23 year-old patient on the basis of bilateral pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma. This young male patient also had multiple paragangliomas located along the spine, marfanoid features of body habitus and numerous mucosal neuromas of the oral cavity and intestinal ganglioneuromatosis. The patient was hospitalised several times between the ages of 11 and 14 due to heart rhythm disorders (tachycardia, multiple supraventricular beats) and pain in the precardiac area. Elevated blood pressure was not observed at that time. In 2010, the patient was admitted to hospital due to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and hypertension; bilateral adrenal tumours were then detected. The patient was referred to the Department of Endocrinology in Szczecin, with suspected pheochromocytoma in order to continue the diagnostic process. This resulted in the diagnosis of bilateral pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma. On the basis of the whole clinical picture, the diagnosis of MEN 2B was established and subsequently confirmed with genetic test results. Following the removal of adrenal tumours and thyroidectomy, the patient was referred to the Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology in Gliwice for further treatment (X-ray therapy and further surgery due to recurrence of medullary carcinoma). This article presents a case of late MEN 2B diagnosis despite the presence of clinical symptoms suggestive of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia observed from early childhood."

CD008686,0,22133181,0,Tarlov cysts: a controversial lesion of the sacral spine.,"The primary aim of our study was to provide a comprehensive review of the clinical, imaging, and histopathological features of Tarlov cysts (TCs) and to report operative and nonoperative management strategies in patients with sacral TCs. A literature review was performed to identify articles that reported surgical and nonsurgical management of TCs over the last 10 years. Tarlov cysts are often incidental lesions found in the spine and do not require surgical intervention in the great majority of cases. When TCs are symptomatic, the typical clinical presentation includes back pain, coccyx pain, low radicular pain, bowel/bladder dysfunction, leg weakness, and sexual dysfunction. Tarlov cysts may be revealed by MR and CT imaging of the lumbosacral spine and must be meticulously differentiated from other overlapping spinal pathological entities. They are typically benign, asymptomatic lesions that can simply be monitored. To date, no consensus exists about the best surgical strategy to use when indicated. The authors report and discuss various surgical strategies including posterior decompression, cyst wall resection, CT-guided needle aspiration with intralesional fibrin injection, and shunting. In operative patients, the rates of short-term and long-term improvement in clinical symptoms are not clear. Although neurological deficit frequently improves after surgical treatment of TC, pain is less likely to do so."
CD008686,0,22132916,0,Tumoral calcinosis presenting as a deformity of the thoracic spine.,"The authors describe a rare case of tumoral calcinosis (TC) of the thoracic spine in a 13-year-old boy with thoracic scoliosis. The patient presented with a 2-year history of back pain. He had no personal or family history of bone disease, deformity, or malignancy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass involving the T-7 vertebral body and the left pedicle. Computed tomography findings suggested that the mass was calcified and that this had resulted in scalloping of the vertebral body. The lesion was resected completely by using a left T-7 costotransversectomy and corpectomy. The deformity was corrected with placement of a vertebral body cage and pedicle screw fixation from T-5 to T-9. Pathological analysis of the mass demonstrated dystrophic calcification with marked hypercellularity and immunostaining consistent with TC. This represents the third reported case of vertebral TC in the pediatric population. Pediatric neurosurgeons should be familiar with lesions such as TC, which may be encountered in the elderly and in hemodialysis-dependent populations, and may not always require aggressive resection."

CD008686,0,22099638,0,Prevalence of neuroleptic-induced restless legs syndrome in patients taking neuroleptic drugs.,"Dopamine deficiency or dopamine dysfunction has been implicated as one of the factors involved in the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome (RLS). Our objective is to determine the prevalence of primary RLS in patients taking neuroleptic drugs. One hundred patients taking neuroleptic drugs and 100 healthy age- and sex-matched controls were interviewed with the Cambridge-Hopkins diagnostic questionnaire for RLS. Patients with malignancy, end-stage renal disease, neuropathy, history of spinal cord diseases, pregnancy and Parkinson's disease were excluded. Only one patient had symptoms consistent with RLS (1%), similar to one patient in the control group. She was a 40 years old female with a diagnosis of depression. She started having RLS symptoms approximately four years after starting perphenazine. The symptoms persisted after the medications were discontinued but decreased in severity and frequency. Her serum ferritin level was 90.3 ng/ml. The prevalence of primary RLS is low in patients attending the out-patient clinic who are taking neuroleptic drugs. Other factors apart from dopaminergic dysfunction are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of RLS."
CD008686,0,22099075,0,Clinical presentation and outcome of patients with intradural spinal cord tumours.,"We aimed to retrospectively investigate the clinical presentation and outcome of surgical intervention of patients with intradural spinal cord tumours (IDSCT), and to assess the predictors of surgical outcome. A total of 109 patients with IDSCT (57 males and 52 females) (130 admissions; mean age, 45.9 years; range, 14-89 years) underwent surgery between 1 January 1994 and 30 June 2009 at The Royal Melbourne Hospital. Ninety per cent of tumours were classified as low grade. Pain was the most common symptom at presentation (60%) and the mean duration of symptoms was 37.8 weeks (0-4 years). Total resection was achieved in 72.3% of patients with IDSCT. An extramedullary location was the strongest predictor of greater extent of tumour resection (odds ratio [OR]=4.367, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.876-10.204, p=0.001), whereas a rostral location was also a significant predictor of greater resection (OR=1.393, 95% CI=1.014-1.908, p=0.040). The surgical mortality rate was 0.92%. A good pre-operative clinical grade was the strongest predictor of a positive post-operative neurological status at discharge for IDSCT (OR=7.382, 95% CI=4.575-11.912, p<0.001). The mean follow-up was 37.9 months (16 days-165 months). A good post-operative clinical grade was the most significant predictor of a positive neurological outcome at short-term follow-up (OR=9.953, 95% CI=4.941-20.051, p<0.001), while a good pre-morbid clinical grade was the most significant predictor of a positive outcome at long-term follow-up (OR=9.498, 95% CI=2.780-32.451, p<0.001). We concluded that surgical outcome was influenced by pre-morbid, pre-operative and post-operative clinical grades, the extent of resection, tumour grade and tumour location with respect to the spinal parenchyma. Surgical intervention has a high success rate for tumour control and we recommend total resection where possible."

CD008686,0,22093436,0,Low back pain as the presenting sign in a patient with primary extradural melanoma of the thoracic spine--a metastatic disease 17 years after complete surgical resection.,"Primary spinal melanomas are extremely rare lesions. In 1906, Hirschberg reported the first primary spinal melanoma, and since then only 40 new cases have been reported. A 47-year-old man was admitted suffering from low back pain, fatigue and loss of body weight persisting for three months. He had a 17-year-old history of an operated primary spinal melanoma from T7-T9, which had remained stable for these 17 years. Routine laboratory findings and clinical symptoms aroused suspicion of a metastatic disease. Multislice computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed stage-IV melanoma with thoracic, abdominal and skeletal metastases without the recurrence of the primary process. Transiliac crest core bone biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. It is important to know that in all cases of back ore skeletal pain and unexplained weight loss, malignancy must always be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in the subjects with a positive medical history. Patients who have back, skeletal, or joint pain that is unresponsive to a few weeks of conservative treatment or have known risk factors with or without serious etiology, are candidates for imaging studies. The present case demonstrates that complete surgical resection alone may result in a favourable outcome, but regular medical follow-up for an extended period, with the purpose of an early detection of a metastatic disease, is highly recommended."

The aim of this work is to assess the safety and efficacy of intrathecal (IT) combination of ziconotide and morphine in malignant pain refractory to high doses of oral opioids. Patients with malignant pain refractory to high oral opioids doses with a mean visual analogue scale of pain intensity (VASPI) score of ≥ 70 mm were enrolled. An IT combination therapy was administered: Ziconotide was started at a dose of 2.4 μg/day, followed by increases of 1.2 μg/day at intervals of at least 7 days, and an initial IT daily dose of morphine was calculated based on its oral daily dose. Percentage change in VASPI scores from baseline was calculated at 2 days, at 7 days, and weekly until the first 28 days. The mean percentage change of VASPI score from baseline was used for efficacy assessment. Safety was monitored based on adverse events and routine laboratory values. Twenty patients were enrolled, with a mean daily VASPI score at rest of 90±7. All had a disseminated cancer with bone metastases involving the spine. The percentage changes in VASPI mean scores from baseline to 2 days, 7 days, and 28 days were 39±13% (95% confidence interval [CI]=13.61-64.49, P<.001), 51±12% (95% CI=27.56-74.56, P<.001), and 62±13% (95% CI=36.03-87.89%, P<.001), respectively.

CD008686,0,22071831,0,The effects of anaesthetic agents on cortical mapping during neurosurgical procedures involving eloquent areas of the brain.,"In patients presenting for surgical resection of lesions involving, or adjacent to, the functionally important eloquent cortical areas, it is vital to achieve complete or near complete resection of the pathology without damaging the healthy surrounding tissues.The eloquent areas that the surgeons are concerned with are the primary motor, premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex and speech areas. If the lesions are within these regions surgeons could either take a biopsy or do a intracapsular decompression without damaging the mentioned areas to avoid postoperative dysfunction. If the lesions are adjacent to the above mentioned areas, the normal anatomy would get distorted. However, proper identification of the above mentioned areas would enable the surgeon to radically remove the tumours. Intraoperative mapping of the cortex with stimulating and recording electrodes is termed as electrophysiological (EP) mapping.The EP mapping of motor, sensory and language cortex is widely employed in the resection of lesions involving or adjacent to the eloquent areas. Both intravenous and inhalational agents are known to affect these EP mapping techniques."

At the first consultation to our hospital, he had felt strong neck stiffness with Glasgow Coma Scale 5 (El, V1, M3), and his body temperature was 37.0 degrees C. His laboratory findings were as follows; white blood cell count 14600/microL, C-reactive protein 4.39mg/dL, and marked elevation of the cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid. We had administered high dose of meropenem, 6 g/day, and also vancomycin (VCM) on therapeutic drug monitoring. Since his clinical symptoms and laboratory findings had not shown adequate response after 4 days later, we had changed VCM to linezolid 1200 mg/day, and had also continued MEPM, which had resulted in prompt resolution of the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. Microbiological examination for cerebrospinal fluid has yielded a growth of serotype III group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae).

CD008686,0,22059207,0,Postoperative respiratory depression with pregabalin: a case series and a preoperative decision algorithm.,"Pregabalin is gaining popularity in the perioperative period for its usefulness in treating neuropathic pain and its apparent opioid- sparing effect. The present report describes the perioperative course of three patients who received pregabalin and experienced significant respiratory depression in the postoperative period. All three patients consented to the report and publication of the present case series. The first patient was elderly with borderline renal dysfunction. She experienced respiratory arrest in the immediate postoperative period following a craniotomy for tumour excision. The second patient presented with severe respiratory depression 12 h after receiving a spinal anesthetic for joint replacement, and was later found to have clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea. The third patient, who was an otherwise healthy elderly individual on benzodiazepines for anxiety, experienced respiratory arrest in the postanesthesia care unit after an uneventful anesthesia for lumbar spine decompression. All of these patients were treated successfully with standard resuscitation measures. Although other causes of respiratory depression in these patients were considered, there appears to be an association between pregabalin and this complication. The present article briefly reviews the evidence regarding the perioperative use of pregabalin. Based on the authors' experience and the available evidence, they believe that pregabalin may be useful in the management of acute pain in carefully selected patients undergoing certain surgeries. A clinical algorithm has been developed to guide the perioperative use of pregabalin. This algorithm may be helpful in increasing the safety of perioperative pregabalin use."

Until recently, only a programmed basal rate of infusion could be delivered, and therefore, breakthrough pain required ongoing use of oral or transmucosal opioids. Recently, an implanted pump manufacturer has introduced a handheld device to bolus additional medication for breakthrough pain.

CD008686,0,21990513,0,Percutaneous plasma mediated radiofrequency ablation of spinal osteoid osteomas.,"Plasma mediated radiofrequency ablation (pmRFA) may allow for the percutaneous treatment of spinal tumors with a decreased risk of thermal injury to neural structures compared with traditional (radiofrequency or interstitial laser) ablation. However, usage of pmRFA has not been previously reported for a primary bone tumor, including an osteoid osteoma. Three patients with a spinal osteoid osteoma underwent pmRFA. The procedure was performed under computed tomography guidance using the 11 gauge Coblation SpineWand (ArthroCare). One lesion (at T11) was directly abutting the spinal canal. With an average follow-up of 20.7 (range 16-24) months, the mean Visual Analog Scale score for back pain decreased from 8.67 to 0.67 and no patient experienced tumor recurrence. pmRFA of spinal osteoid osteomas is feasible, even when the tumor is abutting the spinal canal. Larger studies with a longer follow-up are needed to further delineate the safety and efficacy of this technique."

CD008686,0,21958939,0,Electroacupuncture attenuates mechanical and warm allodynia through suppression of spinal glial activation in a rat model of neuropathic pain.,"Neuropathic pain remains one of the most difficult clinical pain syndromes to treat. It is traditionally viewed as being mediated solely by neurons; however, glial cells have recently been implicated as powerful modulators of pain. It is known that the analgesic effects of electroacupuncture (EA) are mediated by descending pain inhibitory systems, which mainly involve spinal opioid, adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic receptors. However, studies investigating the suppressive effects of EA on spinal glial activation are rare. In the present study, we assessed the cumulative analgesic effects of EA on mechanical and warm allodynia in a rat model of neuropathic pain. We investigated the clinical efficacy of EA as long-term therapy and examined its effects on spinal glia, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9/MMP-2, proinflammatory cytokines and serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration. Rats were randomly divided into four groups as follows: the operation group (OP), operation with EA-non acupoint (EA-NA), operation with EA-ST36 acupoint (EA-ST36), and sham operation (shamOP). Following neuropathic or sham surgery, repeated EA was performed every other day after the behavioral test. On day 53 after the behavioral test, rats were perfused for immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis to observe quantitative changes in spinal glial markers such as OX-42, astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), MMP-9/MMP-2, and proinflammatory cytokines. Allodynia and OX-42/GFAP/MMP-9/MMP-2/tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α/interleukin (IL)-1β activity in the EA-ST36 group was significantly reduced, compared to the OP and EA-NA groups, and IgG in EA-ST36 rats significantly increased. Our results suggest that the analgesic effect of EA may be partly mediated via inhibition of inflammation and glial activation and repeated EA stimulation may be useful for treating chronic pain clinically."
CD008686,0,21956072,0,Functioning paraganglioma of the cervical spine.,"Extradural paraganglioma of the cervical spine is rarely seen. Few reports of this functioning disorder appear in the literature. A 29-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of left shoulder pain and occasional transitional dizziness. This is the first case of a functioning cervical spinal paraganglioma with symptoms of catecholamine excess throughout the operation. A mass in the neck region was discovered by the patient 2 months prior to hospital admission. Physical examination revealed an egg-shaped soft and unflexible mass with no clear boundary in the anterior left part of the neck. Neither sensory disturbance nor motor weakness was evident in the upper and lower extremities. Laboratory studies were normal. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging implied neurilemmoma. Embolization of the branches supplying the mass was taken to reduce perioperative bleeding complications 1 day preoperatively. The patient demonstrated frequent hypertensive spikes with tumor handling. The blood pressure changed between 80/40 mm Hg and 200/105 mm Hg throughout the surgery. The tumor was dissected successfully from the paraspinal tissues, followed by spinal cord decompression of C4 to C6, C5 corpectomy, anterior column reconstruction, and anterior internal fixation with a plate. The histopathological examination yielded a postoperative diagnosis of paraganglioma. Diagnosis and treatment of this rare case require comprehensive perioperative management and meticulous surgical excision."

CD008686,0,21946725,0,Preoperative diagnosis of intramedullary spinal schwannomas.,"Intramedullary spinal schwannomas are rare benign spinal cord tumors and are easily misdiagnosed because of the imaging characteristics shared with intramedullary glioma. Correct preoperative definitive diagnosis is essential for treatment and prognosis. To improve the preoperative diagnostic strategy, clinical and imaging data of seven patients with intramedullary spinal schwannoma (6 men, mean age 44 years, mean duration of illness 4.2 years) treated in our department between 2003 and 2010 were collected and retrospectively evaluated. The cervical cord was affected in five patients, followed by the thoracic cord in two. All seven cases were misdiagnosed as intramedullary glioma based on the imaging characteristics. Comparison of the clinical features of these 7 patients with those of patients with intramedullary tumors (173 ependymomas and 70 astrocytomas) admitted during the same period revealed significant differences in somatic pain and root pain as the initial symptoms between intramedullary spinal schwannomas and ependymomas (p = 0.005) and between intramedullary spinal schwannomas and astrocytomas (p = 0.019), but not between ependymomas and astrocytomas (p = 0.175). Root or somatic pain as an initial symptom is important for the preoperative diagnosis of intramedullary spinal schwannoma, especially if the imaging characteristics are not entirely specific."

CD008686,0,21938604,0,[Epidural spinal cord stimulation for therapy of chronic pain. Summary of the S3 guidelines].,"Epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a reversible but invasive procedure which should be used for neuropathic pain, e.g. complex regional pain syndrome I (CRPS) and for mostly chronic radiculopathy in connection with failed back surgery syndrome following unsuccessful conservative therapy. Epidural SCS can also successfully be used after exclusion of curative procedures and conservative therapy attempts for vascular-linked pain, such as in peripheral arterial occlusive disease stages II and III according to Fontaine and refractory angina pectoris. Clinical practice has shown which clinical symptoms cannot be successfully treated by epidural SCS, e.g. pain in complete paraplegia syndrome or atrophy/injury of the sensory pathways of the spinal cord or cancer pain. A decisive factor is a critical patient selection as well as the diagnosis. Epidural SCS should always be used within an interdisciplinary multimodal therapy concept. Implementation should only be carried out in experienced therapy centers which are in a position to deal with potential complications."

CD008686,0,21928007,0,[Degenerative diseases of the spine].,"Degenerative alterations of the spine are among the most common causes of complaints of the musculoskeletal system. Imaging procedures are an established component of diagnostics and differential diagnoses. A reduction in height of the intervertebral space and sclerotization of the basal and covering plates are part of the first radiological alterations and in the further course can be accompanied by formation of spondylophytes, arthrosis of the intervertebral joints and degenerative vertebral surface gliding. However, early changes of the mobile segments can often not be visualized in x-ray images. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) substantially improve the diagnostic options. Using MRI the spinal column and the surrounding soft tissues can be visualized in 3-D and a differential diagnostic differentiation between inflammatory, traumatized or neoplastic processes is possible. A lack of correlation between the imaging findings and clinical symptoms remains problematic. A meaningful interpretation of x-ray images and MRI can only be made with the appropriate knowledge of the symptoms and possible diseases."
CD008686,0,21927882,0,Symptomatic spinal cord metastasis from cerebral oligodendroglioma.,"Spinal subarachnoid spread is not uncommon in brain oligodendrogliomas; on the other hand, symptomatic involvement of the spinal cord and cauda is very rare, with only 16 reported cases. We report the case of a 41-year-old man who underwent resection of a low-grade frontal oligodendroglioma 4 years previously. He was again observed because of bilateral sciatic pain followed by left leg paresis. A spine MRI showed an intramedullary T12-L1 tumor with root enhancement. At operation, an intramedullary anaplastic oligodendroglioma with left exophytic component was found and partially resected. Two weeks later, a large left frontoparietal anaplastic oligodendroglioma was diagnosed and completely resected. The patient was neurologically stable for 8 months and died 1 year after the spinal surgery because of diffuse brain and spinal leptomeningeal spread. The review of the reported cases shows that spinal symptomatic metastases can occur in both low-grade and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, even many years after surgery of the primary tumor; however, they exceptionally occur as first clinical manifestation or as anaplastic progression. The spinal seeding represents a negative event leading to a short survival."

CD008686,0,21920667,0,Tumor necrosis factor-α levels correlate with postoperative pain severity in lumbar disc hernia patients: opposite clinical effects between tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and 2.,"Lumbar disc hernia (LDH) is a leading cause of chronic pain in adults. The underlying pathology of chronic pain after discectomy remains unclear. Chronic local inflammation is considered to underlie painful symptomatology. In this context, we investigated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) expression at the time of surgery in LDH patients and correlated it with the severity of postoperative pain. We analyzed protein and mRNA levels from muscle, ligamentum flavum (LF), annulus fibrosus (AF), and nucleus pulposus (NP) in LDH patients and scoliosis patients (SP), who served as controls. Pain assessment with the visual analogue scale (VAS) was performed 1 day before surgery and 6 weeks and 12 months postoperatively. TNF-α protein levels were detected in AF, LF, and NP in all LDH patients, but not in SP. TNF-α mRNA was significantly greater in LDH patients than in SP; ie, 5-fold in AF, 3-fold in NP, and 2-fold in LF. For NP, TNF-α protein levels correlated with VAS scores (r=0.54 at 6-week and r=0.65 at 12-month follow-up). Also, TNFR1 protein levels in NP positively correlated with VAS scores (r=0.75 at 6-week and r=0.80 at 12-month follow-up). However, TNFR2 protein levels in AF negatively correlated with VAS scores (r=-0.60 at 6 weeks and r=-0.60 at 12 months follow-up). These data indicate that TNF-α levels could determine the clinical outcome in LDH patients after discectomy. Moreover, the opposite correlation of TNF receptors with pain sensation suggests that an unbalanced expression plays a role in the generation of pain."
CD008686,0,21915706,0,Glandular odontogenic cyst: analysis of 46 cases with special emphasis on microscopic criteria for diagnosis.,"The glandular odontogenic cyst (GOC) is now a relatively well-known entity with recent reviews indicating over 100 cases reported in the English literature. The GOC's importance relates to the fact that it exhibits a propensity for recurrence similar to the odontogenic keratocyst, and that it may be confused microscopically with central mucoepidermoid carcinoma (CMEC). Numerous histopathologic features for the GOC have been described, but the exact microscopic criteria necessary for diagnosis have not been universally accepted. Furthermore, some of the microscopic features of GOC may also be found in dentigerous, botryoid, radicular, and surgical ciliated cysts. The purpose of this multicenter retrospective study is to further define the clinical, radiographic, and microscopic features of GOC, to determine which microscopic features may be helpful for diagnosis in problematic cases, to determine the most appropriate treatment, and to determine if GOC and CMEC share a histopathologic spectrum. In our series of 46 cases, the mean age at diagnosis was 51 years with 71% of cases in the 5th-7th decades. No gender predilection was noted. 80% of cases occurred in the mandible, and 60% of the lesions involved the anterior regions of the jaws. Swelling/expansion was the most common presenting complaint, although some cases were asymptomatic. Radiographically, most cases presented as a well-defined unilocular or multilocular radiolucency involving the periapical area of multiple teeth. Some lesions displayed a scalloped border. Cases also presented in dentigerous, lateral periodontal, and ""globulomaxillary"" relationships. The canine area was a common location for maxillary cases. All cases were treated conservatively (enucleation, curettage, cystectomy, excision). Follow-up on 18 cases revealed a recurrence rate of 50% (9/18), with 6 cases recurring more than once (range of follow-up: 2 months to 20 years; average length of follow-up: 8.75 years). The mean interval from initial treatment to first recurrence was 8 years, and from first recurrence to second recurrence was 5.8 years. Two cases recurred three times and the interval from second to third recurrence was 7 years (exact interval only documented in one case). All cases exhibited eosinophilic cuboidal (hobnail) cells, a feature not specific for GOC, but necessary for diagnosis, in our opinion. Univariate analysis indicated several features that are most helpful in distinguishing GOC from GOC mimickers in problematic cases, including: (1) the presence of microcysts (P < 0.0001); (2) epithelial spheres (P < 0.0001); (3) clear cells (P = 0.0002); (4) variable thickness of the epithelial cyst lining (P = 0.0002); and (5) multiple compartments (P = 0.006). Stratified analysis indicated that when microcysts are present, epithelial spheres and multiple compartments are still significant, and clear cells are marginally significant in distinguishing GOCs from GOC mimickers. The presence of microcysts (P = 0.001), clear cells (P = 0.032), and epithelial spheres (P = 0.042) appeared to be most helpful in distinguishing GOC associated with an unerupted tooth from dentigerous cyst with metaplastic changes. There were no statistically significant differences microscopically between GOCs that recurred and those that did not. The presence of 7 or more microscopic parameters was highly predictive of a diagnosis of GOC in our series (P < 0.0001), while the presence of 5 or less microscopic parameters was highly predictive of a non-GOC diagnosis (P < 0.0001). Islands resembling mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC-like islands) were identified in the cyst wall of three cases, only one of which had follow-up (no evidence of disease at 74 mo.); therefore, at this time insufficient information is available to determine whether GOC and CMEC share a histopathologic spectrum or whether MEC-like islands in GOCs are associated with more aggressive or malignant behavior."

However, seizure during treating non-brain lesion is not a familiar situation to neurosurgeon. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a relatively common situation after systemic chemotherapy. The aim of this study is to make neurosurgeons aware of this potential medical problem. A 52-year-old woman with advanced gastric cancer, presented with low back pain due to spinal metastasis at the 4th lumbar vertebra. Ten cycles of chemotherapy with FOLFOX (5-Fluoruracil/Oxaliplatin) had been completed 23 days ago. Two days before the planned operation, a generalized tonic clonic seizure occurred. She did not have a history of hypertension or seizure. The seizure was stopped with lorazepam 4mg. The brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed high signal changes in both parieto-occipital lobes on the T2-weighted images, and these were partially enhanced, suggesting PRES. The surgery was preceded by treatment with an antiepileptic drug. The MR images, taken 1.5 months after the seizure, showed that the lesion was no longer present. At 3 month follow-up, no additional seizure attack occurred without any seizure medication. The possibility of a seizure attack should be considered if the patient has a history of chemotherapy."

CD008686,0,21850405,0,Therapeutics for childhood neurofibromatosis type 1 and type 2.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and type 2 (NF2) are genetically and medically distinct neurocutaneous disorders that are both associated with tumors affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. NF1 has a frequency of 1 in 3,000, compared with 1 in 30,000 for NF2. Careful surveillance is important for both conditions, to allow early identification and treatment of complications. The most common and important problems in NF1 are cognitive impairment, optic pathway gliomas, plexiform neurofibromas, and orthopaedic issues. Early intervention and tailored educational programs are indicated for learning difficulties. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may be amenable to treatment with stimulant medication. A clinical trial is under way to evaluate lovastatin in the treatment of cognitive problems in children with NF1. Chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin is the current standard of care for symptomatic optic pathway gliomas, but new agents with improved efficacy are needed. Plexiform neurofibromas may be treated with surgery, but often recur. To date, no medical therapy has proven effective in limiting plexiform neurofibroma growth, but several candidate medications are under consideration in clinical trials. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors may arise in preexisting plexiform neurofibromas, so changes in tumor growth or an increase in pain or focal neurologic deficit should prompt further investigation and early treatment with wide surgical resection, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Specialist surgical intervention may be needed for scoliosis and tibial pseudoarthrosis. In NF2, surgical treatment remains a cornerstone of management for symptomatic progressive vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and spinal tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors show promise for the treatment of vestibular schwannomas, with the aim of delaying surgery, and other targeted molecular therapies are becoming available as investigational options. Hearing aids and brainstem and cochlear implants have a role in optimizing functional hearing in some patients. Specialist ophthalmology input should be arranged to monitor for ophthalmologic complications. A coordinated effort is needed to enroll NF1 and NF2 patients in international multicenter clinical trials of promising new pharmacologic agents. Genetic testing is useful for prenatal diagnosis and may be important in understanding individual responses to novel medical therapies in the future. Effective transition to adult services is important, considering the likelihood of further complications in the adult years."
CD008686,0,21849962,0,Failure in long-term treatment of chronic pain in cervical spondylotic myelopathy.,"Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a disease of high variability and its progressive form leads to severe disability. This paper reports on a case of a 31-year-old woman with whiplash neck injury sustained at the age of 11, and subsequent neck pain and numbness of arms. Slow progression of symptoms led to tetraparesis, and C3C4 disc herniation along with cervical myelopathy were revealed at the age of 26. Previously, she started a treatment for hypothyroidism. She underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Two additional operative treatments were done during the next two years due to lack of clinical improvement. Because of chronic pain the number of medications and the number of symptoms have gradually increased. We emphasize the problem of long-term treatment for chronic non-malignant pain and therapeutic dilemma in situations of inadequate analgesia."

CD008686,0,21830055,0,A case of symptomatic cervical perineural (Tarlov) cyst: clinical manifestation and management.,"Perineural (Tarlov) cysts are most often found in the sacral region and are rare in the cervical spine. Although they are usually asymptomatic, a small number of those at the lumbosacral level have been known to produce localized or radicular pain. Few reports are available on symptomatic perineural cysts in the cervical spine and it has not been discussed how they should be managed. We present here a case of cervical perineural cysts with persistent radicular pain where the pain was adequately managed with repetitive transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI). The patient had experienced intractable pain in the posterior neck and left upper extremity for more than 7 years. The nature of the pain was cramping and a tingling sensation, which was aggravated in the supine position. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a perineural cyst in the neural foramen of left C7 root. The patient underwent three repetitive TFESIs targeted at the root. Each injection provided incremental relief, which lasted more than 6 months. Follow-up image revealed shrinkage of the cyst. This case illustrates in detail the clinical manifestation of a rare symptomatic perineural cyst in the cervical region and to our knowledge is the first to report the beneficial effect of repetitive TFESI."
CD008686,0,21822693,0,Hypothalamic dysfunction in a patient with primary lymphoma of the central nervous system.,"A 60-year-old woman with no previous history of chronic disease or malignancy presented with intense back and left leg pain and sleep disturbances. The patient had been treated unsuccessfully for the past 6 months with analgetics. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a soft tissue tumor in the L5-S1 region that involved the spinal canal, and a pathohistological analysis of the tumor specimen confirmed the presence of non-Hodgkin, diffuse large B cell lymphoma. After the diagnosis was confirmed, malaise, nausea, and vomiting developed. Multislice computed tomography of the endocranium showed focal infiltration of the hypothalamus and lateral ventricle; dissemination of a systemic lymphoma was excluded. Therapy was initiated as per the De Angelis protocol. After intravenous and intrathecal administration of metotrexate, the patient developed signs of central diabetes insipidus, which responded to therapy with an antidiuretic hormone analog. Despite the obvious infiltration of the hypothalamus, we cannot exclude an idiosyncratic effect of methotrexate on the central diabetes insipidus."
CD008686,0,21822608,0,Comparative analysis on the diagnosis and treatments of multisegment intramedullary spinal cord tumors between the different age groups.,"Multisegment intramedullary spinal cord tumors (MSICT) are a special type of spinal cord tumor. Up to now, no comparative clinical study of MSICT has been performed according to different age groups. Seventy-seven patients underwent microsurgery for MSICT. As grouped with two different methods, the parametric and nonparametric data of MSICT and patients were comparatively analyzed using statistically correlative methods. Forty-eight patients were males and 29 were females, ranging in age from 4 to 64 years (mean, 32.9 years). Among the six groups, being divided with intervals of 10 years, the whole difference in the initial symptoms of patients (Z = 17.4, P = 0.004) and in the histological classification of tumors (Z = 12.5, P = 0.03) was statistically significant, respectively. Neurodevelopmental tumor and benign glioma predominated in adolescents and decreased in frequency into adulthood where ependymoma became more predominant. In the 25 years old grouping method, there were 27 adolescent and 50 adult patients. The difference in initial symptoms of patients (Z = -2.08, P = 0.04) was statistically significant between the two groups. Pain with motor weakness and gait deterioration predominated in adolescents and decreased in frequency into adulthood where sensory disturbances became more predominant."

The therapy was successful in three patients but one patient with idiopathic facial pain had pain relief only during the test phase of ziconotide with an external pump and not after implanting the Synchromed® pump. With intrathecal morphine therapy this patient achieved good pain relief. We recommend that patients with neuropathic facial pain should be treated with ziconotide after implementation of guideline-based therapy. In the test phase the ziconotide dose should be increased by 0.6 µg/day per week after an initial dose of 0.6-1.2 µg/day to avoid side-effects."
CD008686,0,21816761,0,A second case of Marburg's variant of multiple sclerosis with vasculitis and extensive demyelination.,"Marburg's variant of multiple sclerosis is a rapidly progressive and malignant form of multiple sclerosis (MS) that usually leads to severe disability or death within weeks to months without remission. Few cases have been described in the literature since the original description by Marburg. The classic pathological findings usually include highly destructive zones of extensive demyelination, necrosis with dense cellular infiltrate, and giant reactive astrocytes. We report a case of a 31-year-old woman with Marburg's variant of MS who, over a period of eight months, became totally disabled, blind, and quadriplegic, with vocal cord paralysis, requiring a tracheostomy. The patient underwent diagnostic stereotactic brain biopsy. Clinical findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), serologic and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, and neuropathology are discussed. MRI showed extensive white matter involvement in the brain and spinal cord that continuously progressed over time. A diagnostic stereotactic brain biopsy revealed extensive active demyelination with unexpected finding of active vasculitis and fibrinoid necrosis with a vascular inflammatory cell infiltrate, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils and rare eosinophils. Serologic work-up for vasculitis and neuromyelitis optica was unremarkable and the CSF showed only one oligoclonal band (OCB) not present in serum. This is the second case of Marburg's variant of MS that demonstrated both demyelination and vasculitis. In our case these features were demonstrated simultaneously, even though the demyelination was the predominant pathological finding. Since vasculitis is not a feature of classic MS, these findings pose the question as to whether Marburg's variant of MS is a true variant or different entity altogether."
CD008686,0,21815592,0,Imaging presentation highly manifested as tuberculosis in a case of spinal metastatic carcinoma.,"Usually the clinical manifestations between spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease) and metastasis are not characteristic. Nevertheless, their respective imaging presentations are typical and specific, which makes it relatively easier to attain a correct diagnosis. Imaging features of Pott's disease, in general, include narrowing of intervertebral disk space, collapse of vertebral bodies with eventual progression to kyphotic deformity, destruction of the anterior parts of adjacent vertebrae, formation of a large paravertebral abscess, and calcifications or sequestra within the paravertebral abscess. Spinal tuberculosis is usually endemic, especially in Eastern countries. However, the trend of cancer incidence is also increasing in modern society, which makes it difficult to diagnose spinal osseous lesions. This article presents a case of a 45-year-old man with a 9-month history of low back pain. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine supported the initial diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis. However, pathological examination on the excised specimen resulted in the diagnosis of spinal metastatic adenocarcinoma. We suggest that a definitive diagnosis of spinal metastasis or tuberculosis should not be based on imaging alone. Instead, more attention should be paid to atypical imaging presentations. In addition, biopsy is usually necessary for final diagnosis."
CD008686,0,21814843,0,Strategy of radiation therapy for bone metastases and MSCC in breast cancer patients.,"Bone metastasis is a common event in advanced cancers such as prostate, breast, lung, and renal cancers. Radiation therapy has been widely used for bone metastasis. However, it remains a challenging therapy because no radiation therapeutic guidelines, including radiation dose, radiation field, and fractionation, for patients with bone metastasis have been established. Many randomized controlled trials for bone metastasis have been carried out. They showed no significant difference in pain relief with a short course of radiation therapy such as 8 Gy/1 Fr and 20 Gy/5 Fr or with a long course of radiation therapy such as 30 Gy/10 Fr, 37.5 Gy/15 Fr, and 40 Gy/20 Fr. Toxicity rates with short and long courses were also the same. Recurrence rate at 2 years, however, was significantly higher in patients irradiated with a short course than in patients irradiated with a long course. Those trials also showed that response rate is affected by patient's age, performance state, tumor type, pathological state, number of metastatic tumors, and span from diagnosis of cancer to development of metastatic tumor. Breast cancer has a better prognosis than most other cancers. Recently, there have been significant advances in cancer therapy techniques and improvement in clinical results. Bone metastasis can cause extreme pain and motor deficits. Quality of life for patients with bone metastasis is drastically worsened. Patients with bad prognosis should be treated with radiation therapy when analgesia is the main aim of treatment. Survival of patients with oligometastasis or predominantly bone metastasis is expected to be better than that of patients with visceral metastasis. For patients with vertebral or weight-bearing long bone metastasis, long-course therapy is recommended. Many patients who are expected to have a good prognosis should be treated with a long course of radiation."

Seven patients underwent a total of 22 treatment sessions (3-4 sessions per patient); treatment responses were evaluated clinically, and lesion size was determined using computed tomography (CT). Over 10-26 months of follow-up, tumor sizes and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of all patients were decreased. No patients had complications during the follow-up period. Preliminary results showed that PIIT with pingyangmycin lipiodol emulsion under fluoroscopic guidance is effective and safe and may be considered as a treatment option."

CD008686,0,21782449,0,Surgical treatment and outcomes of metastatic breast cancer to the spine.,"Metastatic vertebral body and spinal epidural lesions cause significant pain and neurological morbidity and negatively impact quality of life and survival. In instances of metastatic epidural spinal cord compression, treatment typically involves surgery and radiotherapy. The incidence of spinal metastases in breast cancer patients is high. In the light of recent improvements in survival among some patients with breast cancer, we reviewed the treatments and outcomes for patients with breast cancer who presented to our institution with metastatic epidural spinal cord compression. We identified all patients undergoing open surgery for the treatment of breast cancer metastases to the spine at our center from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2009. We retrospectively reviewed records for the details of medical history, treatment, surgery, radiographic imaging, and follow-up. The Death Master File from the United States Social Security Administration was queried to identify the date of death where the medical record was incomplete. Outcomes were assessed by overall survival as well as preoperative and postoperative ambulatory status, bladder function, and the American Spinal Injury Association impairment classification system (ASIA). A total of 15 female patients were identified as having surgical intervention directly related to breast cancer metastasis to the spine. Most lesions (12/15) were located in the anterior vertebral column (vertebral body and/or pedicle). Two patients required re-operation, one for epidural fluid collection and one for infection. Roughly half of the patients (8/15) had well-controlled systemic disease at the time of surgery. Five patients had non-contiguous metastatic lesions elsewhere in the spine. Median survival following surgery was 1,025 days; control of systemic disease did not predict duration of postoperative survival. Seven patients had documented improvement in their ability to ambulate in the first 30 days following surgery. Bladder function was preserved in all. No patient deteriorated; and five patients had postoperative improvement of their ASIA impairment scale grade. We concluded that aggressive therapy, including surgery, is warranted for patients with symptomatic metastatic epidural spinal cord compression from breast cancer, including in the setting of advanced and progressive systemic disease."

CD008686,0,21764317,0,Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis and multiple brain metastases from urothelial carcinoma.,"Intramedullary spinal cord metastases (ISCM) are rare spinal cord neoplasms associated with severe neurological deterioration and poor life expectancy. However, their incidence is expected to increase as a result of advances in diagnostic techniques and longer survival of patients with cancer due to improvements in cancer therapy. Reports on ISCM from primary urothelial carcinoma are virtually non existent. We report a 74-year-old male patient with a significant history of a high-grade urothelial carcinoma who presented with progressive back pain and concomitant weakness, grade 3-4/5 proximally and 0-1/5 distally, and distal hyperesthesia and hyperalgesia, particularly of the left lower limb. MRI revealed a contrast-enhancing intramedullary lesion at Th11/Th12. Laminectomies of Th11/Th12 and lesion resection were performed. Postoperative histopathological examinations confirmed the metastatic nature of the lesion. Subsequently the patient developed multiple brain metastases. Radiation therapy was refused by the patient. We conclude that ISCM are devastating complications of systemic cancer. Early and thorough diagnosis, as well as carefully considered and prompt therapy, is important for minimizing the patient's functional deficit, thus improving quality of life."

CD008686,0,21761185,0,[Neuroprotection in the treatment of multiple sclerosis].,"Atrophy, the wasting or shrinkage of tissue, of the nervous system is the main feature of neurodegeneration, i.e. the umbrella term for the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons. Loss of neurons due to cell death and axonal degeneration characterize neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In these illnesses, it still has to be elucidated to which extent inflammation is part of the pathology. Conversely, in chronic inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS), atrophy has previously also been described and neurodegeneration is discussed as a pathologic feature. The most frequent chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS is multiple sclerosis (MS), which leads to devastating relapsing-remitting symptoms and disability during the relapses, increasingly during the course of disease in patients. Meanwhile it became clear that axons already reveal pathology early in the disease and neurons are affected in the cortex and the spinal cord, albeit to a different extent. The broadening of understanding neurodegenerative aspects of MS pathology demands and creates new therapeutic strategies. Current medication used in MS treatment as well as medications about to be approved are primarily anti-inflammatory therapies. By modulating the immune system and thereby blocking key steps of the pathology, the immunomodulation therapies in MS have a slight impact on disability progression. There is, however, clinical and experimental data concerning the potential neuroprotective properties of novel therapies. Combining anti-inflammatory and direct neuroprotective or even neuroregenerative therapy strategies would be a step forward in the treatment of multiple sclerosis."
CD008686,0,21757849,0,Radiotherapy for patients with symptomatic intramedullary spinal cord metastasis.,"The study was performed to evaluate radiotherapy for patients with intramedullary spinal cord metastasis (ISCM) and to identify the clinical features of ISCM. The subjects were 18 patients (8 men, 10 women) with ISCM who underwent radiotherapy between September 2002 and February 2008. The primary lesions were lung cancer in 8 patients (2 small cell, 6 non-small cell), breast cancer in 6, malignant melanoma in 2, renal cell carcinoma in 1, and rectal cancer in 1 patient. Diagnosis, symptoms and survival of these patients were compared with those for 544 patients with vertebral metastases who underwent radiotherapy at the same institute between September 2002 and November 2006. In the 18 patients with ISCM, the 6-month survival rate after radiotherapy was 36% and the median survival period was 4.0 months. Ten patients had neurological improvement or pain relief after radiotherapy. Brain metastases were six fold more frequent in the patients with ISCM than in those with vertebral metastasis [89% vs. 15%, p = 0.001]. At the time of radiotherapy, back pain in patients with vertebral metastasis was more frequent [97% vs. 33%, p = 0.001] but neurological deficits were less common [24% vs. 100% , p = 0.001]. Most ISCM cases were diagnosed by contrast-enhanced MRI, with detection by contrast-enhanced CT in only 3/18 cases (17%). ISCM has a poor prognosis and most patients have neurological deficits that impair quality of life. Early diagnosis by MRI is important for suspected ISCM to allow initiation of radiotherapy before development of neurological deficits."
CD008686,0,21757812,0,Orthopaedic issues in children and adolescents with central nervous system tumors.,"Musculoskeletal deficits remain significant impediments to the function and independence of children and adolescents following successful treatment of Central Nervous System Tumors (CNS) tumors. The sequelae often impair the function of the upper and lower extremities and manifest themselves as difficulties in gross and fine motor skills, which encompasses self care and walking. Overall, the five-year survival rate for children younger than 15 years with brain tumors is between 60 to 90 percent. Approximately two-thirds of survivors have long term neurological deficits. These neurologic deficits often manifest themselves as musculoskeletal abnormalities. It is essential to recognize the potential consequences of a CNS tumor and its associated treatments in an effort to prevent disability. Following the initial neurosurgical and oncologic treatment, the acute and chronic stages of the orthopaedic care for these patients differ significantly. Many of the rehabilitation and treatment principles for brain tumor patients have evolved from the principles used in stroke and traumatic brain injury. Orthopaedic treatment specifically includes preventing, identifying, and treating spasticity, contractures, bony and spinal deformities, and gait abnormalities."

CD008686,0,21749464,0,Concurrent spinal nerve root schwannoma and meningioma mimicking single-component schwannoma.,"We present a first case of concurrent tumors consisting of schwannoma and meningioma arising at the same spinal level in a patient without neurofibromatosis. A 49-year-old man without clinical evidence of neurofibromatosis presented with a 5-month history of right neck pain. MRI demonstrated an extradural tumor involving the right-sided C2 nerve root with a small intradural component. T1- and T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced MRI could not differentiate the intradural tumor as different from the extradural tumor. Total removal of the tumors was performed. No contiguity of the extradural tumor with the intradural tumor was seen. The intradural tumor attached strongly to the dura mater around the C2 nerve root exits. Intraoperative pathological diagnosis confirmed the extradural tumor as schwannoma and the intradural tumor as meningioma. We therefore thoroughly coagulated the dura mater adjacent to the intradural tumor and resected the dura mater around the nerve root exits together with the tumor. Pathological examination revealed that the resection edge of the extradural component consisted of a spinal nerve with thickened epineurium and was free of neoplastic cells. No schwannoma component was evident in the intradural tumor. No obvious transition thus existed between the extra- and intradural tumors. Distinguishing these tumors prior to surgery is critical for determining an optimal surgical plan, as schwannoma and meningioma require different surgical procedures. We therefore recommend a careful review of preoperative imaging with the possibility of concurrent tumors in mind."

CD008686,0,21738111,0,"Bone metastases, general and clinical issues.","The skeleton is the most common organ for metastasis from solid tumours. Bone metastases pose significant diagnostic and clinical challenges and represent an important cause of cancer-related morbidity. Without appropriate bone-directed therapy, many patients will be at high risk for potentially debilitating skeletal-related events (SREs), such as pain, bone fractures, neurologic deficits and hypercalcemia, severely impacting on the patient's quality of life. Because of their high incidence, bone metastases impose significant demands on health care resources. The optimal management of skeletal metastases depends on the underlying biology of the disease, the extent of bone involvement, the presence and severity of symptoms, the availability of effective systemic therapies and life expectancy of the patient. This article discusses clinical issues concerning diagnosis and available treatment approaches based on the presentation of skeletal involvement. Emphasis is placed on the role of external beam-radiotherapy as a local mode of treatment for palliation of bone pain, decompression of epidural compression and as potential ablative approach through high-dose image-guided irradiation (IGRT) in patients presenting with oligometastatic disease."

CD008686,0,21703587,0,"Intervertebral disk repair by protein, gene, or cell injection: a framework for rehabilitation-focused biologics in the spine.","Low back pain carries an enormous socioeconomic burden. Current treatment modalities for symptomatic intervertebral disk (IVD) degeneration have limited and often inconsistent clinical benefits. Novel approaches with the potential to halt or even reverse disk degeneration and restore physiologic disk function, such as biological treatments, are therefore very attractive. The following barriers are impeding the development of successful therapeutic interventions: (1) the biology and pathophysiology of disk degeneration are not well understood, and (2) the precise relationship between IVD degeneration and low back pain remains unclear. This article reviews the structural changes that take place during IVD degeneration and their relationship to diskogenic back pain. It also presents treatment modalities that currently are under laboratory investigation and are being studied in clinical trials. The authors of recent studies have shown that the content of large proteoglycans, such as aggrecan and versican, decreases with aging and IVD degeneration, whereas the content of certain small proteoglycans, such as biglycan, increases. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α also are associated with IVD degeneration and are potential biomarkers of IVD degeneration and repair. Our group of investigators and others have developed in vitro models of IVD cell and explant culture in addition to in vivo animal models to study IVD degeneration and repair. With the use of these models, we have tested candidate therapeutic agents to assess their therapeutic potential for matrix restoration. When a rabbit annular puncture model of IVD degeneration was used, injections of either bone morphogenetic protein-7 (also known as osteogenic protein-1) or bone morphogenetic protein-14 (also known as growth differentiation factor-5) were shown to be effective in restoring IVD structures. On the basis of these data, the Food and Drug Administration has recently allowed the initiation of Investigational New Drug clinical trials on osteogenic protein-1 and growth differentiation factor-5 in the United States. Protein therapies such as other growth factors, inhibitors of degradation enzymes or cytokines, and cell therapies also are being investigated in laboratory settings with the goal of restoring disk function and alleviating back pain symptoms. These therapies may be used by physiatrists with the skills required to administer intradiskal injections and supervise a comprehensive rehabilitation program after the procedures. Ultimately, the clinical use of any biological treatment discussed in this article would require the collective efforts of clinicians and researchers."

Independent of their origin, spinal tumors usually manifest with progressive local or radicular pain and neurological deficits. The treatment of choice for most of these tumors is a complete surgical resection. In tumors with infiltrative growth into the intramedullary area, a marginal tumor tissue has to be left in situ in order to avoid additional neurological deficits. In particular if neurological deficits appear, a fast surgical intervention is indicated, since the prognosis depends on duration and severity of the preoperative existing deficits.

Although many cases of LBP are related to the musculoskeletal system and appropriate for the care of the physical therapist (PT), some episodes of LBP have a systemic cause. Thus, it is the role of the PT to ensure each patient is appropriate for physical therapy intervention throughout the episode of care. When the patient's condition is not appropriate for physical therapy intervention, it is the PT's responsibility to refer the patient to other medical professions to ensure optimal patient care. The purpose of this case report is to describe a patient referred to PT who was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis. The patient presented initially to physical therapy with a diagnosis of LBP.

Use of expandable implants is supported by an emerging body of literature. Newer expandable cages have some advantages over traditional mesh implants, structural allograft, and polyetheretherketone or carbon fiber cages. To determine the utility of an expandable titanium cage in spine reconstruction, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who had undergone this reconstruction after single or multilevel thoracic and/or lumbar vertebrectomy. Here we report on our experience using expandable cages at 2 large academic medical centers. Outcome was based on both clinical and radiographic measures with cross-sectional analysis. Thirty-five patients were identified. Of these, 20 had undergone surgery for neoplasm, 8 for trauma, and 7 for infection. Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 12 to 50 months). Early postoperative kyphosis correction, restoration of sagittal alignment at 12 months, and reduction in visual analog scale pain score were significant. There was no difference in Oswestry Disability Index or height restoration. Expandable intervertebral body strut grafts appear to be a safe and effective option in spine reconstruction after a vertebrectomy and should be considered a treatment option."

Subacute MTX neurotoxicity occurs within days to weeks after the intravenous or intrathecal therapy and characterized by a distinct presentation with remarkable clinical resemblance to stroke, including hemiparesis, hemisensory deficits, aphasia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and diplopia. Herein the authors describe the clinical and typical neuroimaging features of a female patient with ALL who presented with subacute MTX neurotoxicity that rapidly progressed to a severe clinical condition in a few hours but eventually resolved completely with dexamethasone and folinic acid. Subacute MTX neurotoxicity is a transient neurological dysfunction that should be considered in patients presenting with stroke-like and various neurological symptoms 10 to 14 days after intrathecal therapy and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging should be undertaken for the correct diagnosis and exclusion of possible ischemic infarct. Discontinuation of subsequent intrathecal MTX therapies should be considered in severe cases and treatment with dexamethasone and folinic acid may help to resolve the symptoms."
CD008686,0,21695605,0,[Clinical and neuroradiological diagnostics of orbital tumors].,"Exophthalmus is the leading sign of space-occupying lesions of the orbit. Patients may further present with lid swelling, impaired ocular motility and optic neuropathy including a relative afferent pupillary defect, compressive optic disc edema or optic atrophy. Orbital tumors can be classified into various categories depending on the etiology, as lymphoproliferative lesions (in particular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as the most common malignant orbital tumor of adulthood), optic nerve and meningeal lesions, lacrimal gland lesions, secondary orbital tumors which extend to the orbit from neighboring structures and metastases. Slightly less common are vasculogenic and cystic lesions including cavernous hemangioma as the most common benign orbital tumor of adulthood and dermoid cysts as the most common benign orbital tumor of childhood. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common malignant orbital tumor of childhood but has a low total incidence. Orbital tumors might not only cause symptoms like pain, diplopia and loss of visual acuity but may also lead to esthetically disfiguring changes. Particular attention should be paid to underlying systemic diseases and generalized tumor diseases. This article illustrates the approach to a detailed clinical and neuroradiological assessment which is mandatory for the care of orbital tumor patients."

Indication for surgery included intractable neck pain, spinal cord compression and stabilization of impending pathological fractures. We report our experience with expandable cylindrical cages in order to reconstruct and to stabilize cervical spine with metastasis. Between June 2004 and January 2006, a consecutive series of six patients underwent to resection of metastatic tumor in the cervical spine followed by expandable cylindrical cage reconstruction of the anterior vertebral column. All patients achieved immediate stability with neurological preservation. There were no significant complications related to the expandable cages in a mean follow up period of 10.5 months. Expandable cylindrical cages are effective resources for functional reconstruction after tumor resection in patients with cervical metastasis with advantages in the quality of life."

This increases the risk of injury to this vessel if the surgeon is unaware of such abnormalities preoperatively. The aim of our retrospective study was to identify patient factors that may predict anomalous intraforaminal vertebral arteries. Patient records were obtained from a previous study. In that study, the records of each consecutive patient who underwent cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for axial neck pain, radiculopathy, or myelopathy between January 2007 and January 2008 were reviewed. The social and medical histories of each patient were evaluated with respect to the presence or absence of an aberrant vertebral artery. We reviewed the medical records of the 250 patients whose MRIs were reviewed in the previous study. Seven patients were excluded for incomplete records. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were performed to compare the normal vertebral artery anatomy patients to the aberrant patients. The medical records of 19 patients with aberrant vertebral arteries and 224 patients with normal vertebral arteries were reviewed. The aberrant group was significantly older than the normal group (P=.00015). The only diagnostic condition that represented a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups was incidence of cancer. A relationship may exist between patient age, cancer, and medialization of the vertebral artery. The mechanism of this possible relationship is unclear. Although aberrant vertebral arteries are rare, a surgeon should have raised suspicion of this possibility in patients with a history of cancer."

CD008686,0,21654459,0,Van neck disease: osteochondrosis of the ischiopubic synchondrosis.,"Van Neck disease (VND) is a benign skeletal abnormality of children involving a hyperostosis of the ischiopubic synchondrosis (IPS) seen on radiographs. Patients typically complain of vague groin or buttock pain. Few descriptions of this disorder exist and it easily can be mistaken for other entities, particularly osteomyelitis or tumor. It is often considered a diagnosis of exclusion as laboratory values are usually normal and routine radiographic workup may be nonspecific. We present a series of patients with VND and we compare them with a similar cohort of patients with acute hematogenous ischiopubic osteomyelitis (IPOM). We also draw attention to a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding that seems to support the theory that VND results from an excessive pull of the hamstring tendon on the ischial tuberosity."

CD008686,0,21621005,0,Transverse myelitis.,"Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is an etiologically heterogeneous syndrome with acute or subacute onset, in which inflammation of the spinal cord results in neurologic deficits, manifesting as weakness, sensory loss and autonomic dysfunction. It is frequently associated with infectious or systemic autoimmune diseases, but its etiology remains unknown in a substantial portion of cases, which are classified as idiopathic. Unifying diagnostic criteria for idiopathic and disease-associated ATM were proposed in 2002. Although they have been applied to a few cohorts of patients, the limited information provided in the relevant publications has not yet yielded many new insights on the clinical characteristics, disease course, and outcome of adult patients with idiopathic ATM compared to older studies that did not always distinguish between the various etiologies of ATM. There is, however, some new epidemiological data indicating that the incidence of idiopathic ATM is considerably higher, and the female preponderance greater, than previously recognized. In addition, new data on children with ATM show that the prognosis in pediatric patients is not always as benign as previous studies had indicated. The combination of ATM and optic neuritis characterize Devic's syndrome or neuromyelitis optica (NMO). A seminal discovery was the identification of an antibody that is a specific marker not only for NMO, but also of some of its characteristic manifestations in isolation, including longitudinally extensive TM. This has resulted in the proposal that all of the disorders that are associated with NMO-IgG positivity constitute part of an NMO spectrum of disorders. This antibody recognizes aquaporin-4, which represents the most abundant water channel of the central nervous system. There is growing evidence that the antibodies targeting this channel protein have pathogenic potential, thereby providing insights into the possible pathogenetic mechanisms of at least one type of ATM."

CD008686,0,21607920,0,Looking at appearance of urine before performing a renal biopsy in nephrotic syndrome.,"Chyluria results from an abnormal connection between lymphatic bed and urinary tract, causing lymph leakage into the urine. The clinical picture often begins with the appearance of cloudy, milky urines accompanied by monolateral flank pain, malnutrition, weight loss and weakness. We report a case of chyluria that occurred in a young woman who was referred to our unit for nephrotic-range proteinuria. Before performing a renal biopsy, we found that urine analysis demonstrated a massive lipiduria. Therefore, we collected urine samples from each kidney with a selective ureteral catheterization, demonstrating a monolateral source of lipids and proteins. We suspended the renal biopsy and performed a lymphography that showed an inherited lymphangioma on the left lumbar lymphatic bed. Sclerosing solution instillation, renal pedicle lymphatic disconnection or laser therapy are invasive therapeutical options that may cause severe adverse effects. Instead of these procedures, a conservative therapy based on a low-fat diet supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides was chosen. This dietetic schedule was followed by complete resolution of proteinuria and lipiduria. The patient progressively gained body weight and improved quality of life. No relapses were observed after 3 years of follow-up. This case emphasizes the possible role of a noninvasive therapeutical option for patients with chyluria."
CD008686,0,21607186,0,Sparganosis in the lumbar spine : report of two cases and review of the literature.,"Sparganosis is a rare parasitic infection affecting various organs, including the central nervous system, especially the lumbar epidural space. This report describes the identification of disease and different strategies of treatments with preoperative information. A 42-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of urinary incontinence and impotence. He had a history of ingesting raw frogs 40 years ago. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed an intramedullary nodular mass at conus medullaris and severe inflammation in the cauda equina. A 51-year-old woman was admitted with acute pain in the left inguinal area. We observed a lesion which seemed to be a tumor of the lumbar epidural space on MR imaging. She also had a history of ingesting inadequately cooked snakes 10 years ago. In the first patient, mass removal was attempted through laminectomy and parasite infection was identified during intra-operative frozen biopsy. Total removal could not be performed because of severe arachnoiditis and adhesion. We therefore decided to terminate the operation and final histology confirmed dead sparganum infection. We also concluded further surgical trial for total removal of the dead worm and inflammatory grannulation totally. However, after seeing another physician at different hospital, he was operated again which resulted in worsening of pain and neurological deficit. In the second patient, we totally removed dorsal epidural mass. Final histology and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed living sparganum infection and her pain disappeared. Although the treatment of choice is surgical resection of living sparganum with inflammation, the attempt to remove dead worm and adhesive granulation tissue may cause unwanted complications to the patients. Therefore, the result of preoperative ELISA, as well as the information from image and history, must be considered as important factors to decide whether a surgery is necessary or not."
CD008686,0,21605634,0,APP/SOD1 overexpressing mice present reduced neuropathic pain sensitivity.,"There are controversies regarding pain expression in mentally disabled people, including Down syndrome patients. The aim of this study was to examine neuropathic pain-related behavior and peripheral nerve regeneration in mouse model of Down syndrome. Sciatic nerves of double transgenic mice, overexpressing both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) genes, and FVB/N wild type mice were transected and immediately resutured. Evaluation of autotomy and functional recovery was carried out during 4-week follow-up. We found markedly less severe autotomy in transgenic animals, although the onset of autotomy was significantly delayed in control mice. Interestingly, neuroma formation at the injury site was significantly more prominent in transgenic animals. Sciatic function index outcome was better in transgenic mice than in wild-type group. Histological evaluation revealed no statistically significant differences in the number of GAP-43-positive growth cones and macrophages in the distal stump of the transected nerve between groups. However, in transgenic animals, the regenerating axons were arranged more chaotically. The number of Schwann cells in the distal stump of the transected nerves was significantly lower in transgenic mice. The number of surviving motoneurons was markedly decreased in transgenic group. We measured also the atrophy of denervated muscles and found it decreased in APP/SOD1 overexpressing mice. Taken together, in this model of Down syndrome, we observed increased neuroma formation and decreased autotomy after peripheral nerve injury. Our findings suggest that APP/SOD1 overexpressing mice are less sensitive for neuropathic pain associated with neuroma."

CD008686,0,21600368,0,Cancer rehabilitation.,"Cancer rehabilitation is the subspecialty of rehabilitation medicine concerned with restoring and maintaining the highest possible level of function, independence, and quality of life to patients at all stages of their cancer diagnosis, including those undergoing potentially curative therapy and those receiving palliative care, as well as cancer survivors. Cancer rehabilitation physicians specialize in the evaluation and treatment of neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, and functional complications of cancer and cancer treatments such as acute and chronic pain, weakness, muscle spasm, myelopathy, radiculopathy, plexopathy, neuropathy, myopathy, deconditioning, contracture, spasticity, lymphedema, amputation, shoulder dysfunction, and gait disorders, among others. Late effects of radiation represents a particular challenge for cancer rehabilitation physicians as radiation fibrosis may affect multiple structures, including the spinal cord, nerve roots, plexus, local nerves, and muscles, as well as their supporting structures. A comprehensive clinical evaluation involving an in-depth working knowledge of neuromuscular and musculoskeletal anatomy and incorporating specialized physical examination maneuvers allows the physiatrist to clarify the specific etiology of pain and functional disorders. A safe and effective rehabilitation program will depend heavily on an accurate diagnosis of the cause of pain or dysfunction."

The mean age incidence of osteoblastoma is 20.4 years. In our case, a rare presentation of osteoblastoma was seen in the first decade. The child was admitted with a 1-year history of increasing back pain and radiculopathy. The child was evaluated with X-rays, computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging, which indicated involvement of the posterior elements of the 4(th) lumbar vertebrae. Decompression of the L5 nerve and resection of the tumor was performed. Osteoblastoma is a rare tumor with an incidence of 1% of all tumors and 30-40% of cases involving the spine. Osteoblastoma occurs most commonly in males (M:F, 2.5:1). The most common area of involvement is the cervical spine followed by the lumbar spine.

CD008686,0,21556025,0,Bone metastasis in prostate cancer: emerging therapeutic strategies.,"Metastatic bone disease (MBD) in advanced-stage cancer increases the risk of intractable bone pain, pathological skeletal fracture, spinal-cord compression and decreased survival. The disease manifestation course during MBD is largely driven by homotypic and heterotypic cellular interactions between invading tumor cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The outcome is a sustained vicious cycle of bone matrix remodeling. Osteoclast-mediated bone degradation and subsequent bone loss are the hallmarks of secondary bone metastases from most solid tumors. An additional complication in prostate cancer is the predominance of osteosclerotic lesions typified by inappropriate bone production. Successful therapeutic strategies for the treatment of osteolytic MBD include the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates or subcutaneous inhibitors of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL). Inhibitors of SRC and cABL kinases and cathepsin K are under clinical investigation as potential anti-osteolytics. In contrast to the rapid progress being made in the development of anti-osteolytic therapies, the treatment of osteosclerotic MBD remains restricted to palliative radiotherapy for symptomatic solitary lesions and systemic taxane-based chemotherapy for widespread multiple lesions. This Review discusses the complex pathology of bone lesions in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and focuses on new therapeutic strategies and targets that are emerging in preclinical studies."

She presented with a 3-week history of progressively increasing headaches, retrobulbar pain, rapidly progressive visual loss in the right eye and blurred vision in the left eye. Early clinical examination revealed right optic disc swelling and she was initially diagnosed with demyelinating optic neuritis. Her clinical course deteriorated with total visual loss in the right eye and progressive visual loss in the left eye despite treatment with intravenous (IV) methylprednisone and IV immunoglobulins. MRI revealed enhancement of the right optic nerve and optic chiasm, with multiple periventricular hyperintense foci. Six weeks later, the patient presented with left facial palsy and left hemiparesis. Follow-up MRI showed multiple enhancing lesions in addition to the previous lesions involving right lentiform and right thalamic nucleus, right cerebral peduncle, right temporal and parietal lobes. Although the optic nerve biopsy was inconclusive, the brain biopsy revealed glioblastoma multiforme. This report demonstrated that malignant glioma of adulthood may be multicentric and may mimic optic neuritis clinically, which might help explain the difficulties in diagnosis."
CD008686,0,21548521,0,Lymphangioma circumscriptum and Whimster's hypothesis revisited.,"An 11-year-old boy was referred to our department for vesicular lesions of the buttocks of 7 years' duration (Figure 1). He also complained of intermittent oozing of serosanguineous fluid, which caused social impairment. On clinical examination, clusters of flesh-colored to translucent papules were present over the buttocks, perianal area, and left calf. The lesions were excised 4 years ago, after confirming the diagnosis of lymphangioma circumscriptum on histopathology. They started recurring on and around the surgical site within 6 months of surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to evaluate the deeper extension of the lesion. The lymphangioma previously identified by cutaneous examination manifested as an altered T2 signal, spreading to subcutaneous tissues and major and minor muscles and infiltrating the sacral vertebrae and presacral area (Figure 2). Although the muscles were infiltrated, the boy was asymptomatic. He did not have pain, tenderness, or difficulty in the movement of the back and hip muscles. Renal function was also normal. Options of surgical resection and sclerotherapy were rejected by the parents because of the extensive spread of lymphangioma and fear of disfigurement. Carbon dioxide laser ablation was performed, and the parents were asked to follow up regularly for control of any symptoms, if they appear in the future."

CD008686,0,21509348,0,Spondylodiscitis as the only clinical manifestation of the onset of psoriatic spondyloarthritis.,"We report the case of a 47-year-old man with insidious onset of progressively disabling back pain in the dorsal region. The patient had minimal dermatitic lesions to the elbows and behind the ears, which were attributed to minimal psoriasis. An initial MRI of the spine, one month after the onset of symptoms, showed an alteration in the D7-D8 vertebrae as from bone marrow edema. The successive CT scan of the spine, after about six months, showed a significant osteolytic process of the D7 and D8 vertebrae and extensive swelling of surrounding tissues. A contemporary lung CT scan showed opacity in the right lung. A first hypothesis of lung cancer with vertebral metastases was ruled out by the negative bronchoscopy and the subsequent disappearance of lung opacity after antibiotic therapy. A CT-guided needle biopsy of the spine gave negative results for granulomatous and infectious tumor pathology. The later appearance of peripheral polyarthritis and the presence of initial bone marrow edema justified the diagnosis of psoriatic spondylodiscitis. Therapy with anti-TNF-alpha (Eternacept) was initiated, with which both the painful symptomatology and the radiological damage were quickly resolved. This is the first case in literature about spondylodiscitis as the manifestation of the onset of psoriatic spondyloarthritis."

CD008686,0,21507652,0,Kyphoplasty for the treatment of malignant vertebral compression fractures caused by metastases.,"Despite the literature supporting the efficacy of kyphoplasty for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in multiple myeloma, few reports exist documenting its use in the treatment of malignant vertebral compression fractures (MVCF) caused by metastases. Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of kyphoplasty in the treatment of MVCF without epidural involvement. We performed a retrospective review of clinical outcome data for 48 patients with multiple spinal metastases treated with kyphoplasty. Outcome data (vertebral body height variation, degree of kyphosis, visual analog scale score for pain, Oswestry Disability Index score, the Short Form-36 [SF-36] questionnaire score for function) were collected preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after treatment. Significant improvements in all of the outcome measures were observed postoperatively and throughout the duration of follow-up. The mean anterior vertebral body height variation improved from 52.7 ± 16.8% preoperatively to 85.3% ± 13.2% postoperatively (p < 0.001). Kyphotic angle improved from 16.4° ± 4.7° preoperatively to 8.4° ± 2.5° postoperatively (p < 0.001). The mean visual analog scale score decreased significantly from presurgery to postsurgery (7.4 ± 2.1 to 3.8 ± 1.6; p<0.001), as did the Oswestry Disability Index score (71.5 ± 16.7 to 32.4 ± 9.6; p<0.001). The SF-36 scores for bodily pain, physical function, vitality, and social functioning all also showed significant improvement (p<0.05). Kyphoplasty is an effective, minimally invasive procedure for the stabilization of pathological vertebral fractures caused by metastatic disease, even in levels with vertebral wall deficiency, leading to a statistically significant reduction in pain, improvement in function and prevention of further kyphotic deformity of the spine."
CD008686,0,21500136,0,Tarlov cysts: an overlooked clinical problem.,"Symptomatic Tarlov cysts typically cause chronic pelvic and lower extremity pain and sacral nerve root radiculopathy. Historically, open surgical treatment involved significant patient morbidity, particularly postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and infection. These CSF leaks often required multiple surgical procedures to seal. Over the past 20 years, there have been two or three isolated case reports of computed tomography (CT)-guided needle aspirations that offered limited evidence of treatment efficacy and safety. Some have reported high rates of postprocedure aseptic meningitis that were not well explained. These poor results dissuaded physicians from caring for these patients. As a group these patients are usually treated dismissively and told their cysts are asymptomatic and their pain must be coming from somewhere else. Many of them have had an unnecessary discectomy or a spinal fusion, and when these procedures did not relieve their pain they were told they are a ""failed back patient."" We have treated more than a hundred patients with symptomatic Tarlov cysts by CT fluoroscopic-guided needle aspiration and fibrin injection and have had excellent results with no meaningful complications and never a case of aseptic meningitis. We believe this is a safe, highly effective first-line treatment for symptomatic Tarlov cysts."

Failure and delays in test follow-up are a frequent problem in medicine, occurring in more than 5% of significantly abnormal ambulatory test results. Rather than simply blaming involved clinicians, systems for managing tests need to be reengineered using methods from reliability sciences. These begin with investigations into the systemic causes of the failures, then application of approaches such as heightened situational awareness, closed-loop systems, improved handoffs, just-in-time work, culture and practices of stopping to fix problems, forcing functions and simplification, enhanced visual cues, and cautious use of information technology and redundancy, all while avoiding suboptimization. Emerging test management systems and critical test follow-up recommendations illustrate how applying these principles can enhance this important aspect of patient safety."

The procedure, although minimally invasive, could be painful and is better tolerated if a conscious sedation regimen is added to local anesthesia.

CD008686,0,21424101,0,Urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis associated with cystic disease of the kidney.,"Primary tumors of the renal pelvis and ureter account for about 8% of all urinary tract tumors. More than 90% of them are urothelial carcinomas. On the other hand, unilateral multicystic renal disease is an uncommon pathologic condition that may be mistaken for unilateral autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, multilocular cystic nephroma or cystic neoplasm. We present the case of a 54-year-old male known with arterial hypertension, admitted in the Second Surgery Department of Emergency County Hospital, Constanta, with intense right flank and right lumbar pain. This symptom started one month before hospital admission. Based on clinical features and imaging evaluations we established a presumptive diagnosis of unilateral autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. For these reasons, total right nephrectomy was performed. Pathologic examination of the nephrectomy specimen revealed high-grade urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis associated with unilateral multicystic renal disease. The particularity of this case lies in the uncommon association between two rare renal pathological conditions diagnosed by pathological examination."
CD008686,0,21448582,0,Anterior vertebroplasty of adjacent levels after vertebral body replacement.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a new method, which should help to avoid cage subsidence after vertebrectomy in short fusions. After implantation of an extendable vertebral body replacement (VBR) the two adjacent endplates to the fractured or destroyed vertebra were augmented with bone cement using the anterior approach in 20 patients with short circumferential fusion. All patients were followed up for 2 years clinically and radiographically. X-rays were reviewed for kyphosis, cage subsidence, presence of a solid fusion mass and instrumentation failure. Changes in every day activities (Oswestry Disability Index-ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS), pain score, as well as technique-related complications were examined. The mean amount of kyphosis correction was 12.8° (±6.4°) and changed by only 0.3° (±0.4°) until last follow-up. Pain (VAS) and ODI scores were significantly improved and did not change until last follow-up. In all but two cases, the authors observed solid union with incorporation of the cage. No surgery-related complications were recorded. In one case revision was advised because of non-union due to septic loosening. The augmentation of the adjacent vertebras after anterior VBR provides an enhancement of the interface between cage and vertebra in cases with poor bone quality and in revision surgery. The technique is simple and safe, as the needles can be placed under visual control. Cement augmentation of the endplates may reduce interbody device subsidence."
CD008686,0,21437176,0,Spinal chondrosarcoma: a review.,"Chondrosarcoma is the third most common primary malignant bone tumor. Yet the spine represents the primary location in only 2% to 12% of these tumors. Almost all patients present with pain and a palpable mass. About 50% of patients present with neurologic symptoms. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are generally unsuccessful while surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Early diagnosis and careful surgical staging are important to achieve adequate management. This paper provides an overview of the histopathological classification, clinical presentation, and diagnostic procedures regarding spinal chondrosarcoma. We highlight specific treatment modalities and discuss which is truly the most suitable approach for these tumors. Abstracts and original articles in English investigating these tumors were searched and analyzed with the use of the PubMed and Scopus databases with ""chondrosarcoma and spine"" as keywords."

CD008686,0,21436316,0,Serine proteases mediate inflammatory pain in acute pancreatitis.,"Acute pancreatitis is a life-threatening inflammatory disease characterized by abdominal pain of unknown etiology. Trypsin, a key mediator of pancreatitis, causes inflammation and pain by activating protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR(2)), but the isoforms of trypsin that cause pancreatitis and pancreatic pain are unknown. We hypothesized that human trypsin IV and rat P23, which activate PAR(2) and are resistant to pancreatic trypsin inhibitors, contribute to pancreatic inflammation and pain. Injections of a subinflammatory dose of exogenous trypsin increased c-Fos immunoreactivity, indicative of spinal nociceptive activation, but did not cause inflammation, as assessed by measuring serum amylase and myeloperoxidase activity and by histology. The same dose of trypsin IV and P23 increased some inflammatory end points and caused a more robust effect on nociception, which was blocked by melagatran, a trypsin inhibitor that also inhibits polypeptide-resistant trypsin isoforms. To determine the contribution of endogenous activation of trypsin and its minor isoforms, recombinant enterokinase (ENK), which activates trypsins in the duodenum, was administered into the pancreas. Intraductal ENK caused nociception and inflammation that were diminished by polypeptide inhibitors, including soybean trypsin inhibitor and a specific trypsin inhibitor (type I-P), and by melagatran. Finally, the secretagogue cerulein induced pancreatic nociceptive activation and nocifensive behavior that were reversed by melagatran. Thus trypsin and its minor isoforms mediate pancreatic pain and inflammation. In particular, the inhibitor-resistant isoforms trypsin IV and P23 may be important in mediating prolonged pancreatic inflammatory pain in pancreatitis. Our results suggest that inhibitors of these isoforms could be novel therapies for pancreatitis pain."
CD008686,0,21435886,0,Thymic carcinoma with primary spine metastasis.,"Thymic carcinomas (TC) are rare tumors, representing 0.2% to 1.5% of all malignancies, with extrathoracic metastases to liver, kidney and bone occurring in 1% to 15% of patients. Although TC exhibit highly aggressive biological behavior, spinal metastasis with cord compression is rare. We describe a 57-year-old man with a 2-month history of cervicodorsal pain diagnosed with TC with primary spinal metastasis. We conclude that TC should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients who have developed spine metastatic tumors. Early detection and appropriate surgical treatment can lead to preservation of spinal stability and neurologic improvement."

Her medical history was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed complete paraplegia, total sensory loss below the T7 dermatome, and significant vesicorectal dysfunction. MRI revealed an intraspinal mass from T3 to T4, which was hyperintense on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. Blood examination found no abnormality. She underwent emergent hemilaminectomy and removal of the hematoma. Intraoperatively, unusually ectatic venous vessels were found adhered to the lower surface of the epidural clot. No concurrent vascular malformations were identified and the dura mater was intact. The histological diagnosis was angiolipoma. Postoperatively her neurological deficits showed remarkable improvement, and she gave birth to a healthy baby. Spinal angiolipoma in a pregnant woman may be complicated with acute epidural hemorrhage. Emergent surgical evacuation can be performed safely with a good functional prognosis."

CD008686,0,21415298,0,Contrasting natural histories of thoracic spine pneumatocysts: resolution versus rapid enlargement.,"An intraosseous pneumatocyst is an unusual cause of gas in a vertebral body and is rarely reported in the thoracic spine. We report the evolution of thoracic spine pneumatocysts, one that enlarged rapidly with resorption of fluid and one that resolved. A 65-year-old female with lower back and left leg pain underwent MRI of the lumbar spine, which demonstrated a well-defined lesion in a T10 vertebral body of low-signal on T(1) and T(2) weighted imaging. CT confirmed this as a gas-containing cyst. Review of previous imaging showed that this lesion had initially contained fluid and had expanded rapidly over 14 months. It also showed smaller pneumatocysts, which had resolved. The variable natural history and imaging features of pneumatocysts make them an important differential diagnosis of an intravertebral lesion. Their aetiology is not known, but previous case reports suggest that they can occur spontaneously or in association with vacuum phenomenon in adjacent discs or facet joints. Previous reports have observed that they can fill with granulation tissue or fluid, and the case we report demonstrates that this fluid can be resorbed and that the pneumatocyst can undergo rapid enlargement. A pneumatocyst is a differential diagnosis for an expanding intravertebral lesion of indeterminate MRI characteristics. The diagnosis can be made with CT if the lesion is gas or gas and fluid filled."

Bisphosphonates have proven their effectiveness in reducing the number of bone complications (hypercalcemia, pain, disease-related fractures, spinal cord compression) and delaying their occurrence in patients with bone tumours; they have also been shown to reduce the need for bone surgery and palliative or pain-relieving radiotherapy in these patients. International recommendations for the treatment of bone lesions related to malignant solid tumours and multiple myeloma have been established. We have elaborated clinical practice guidelines on the use of bisphosphonates to assist treatment decision-making in bone oncology. The guide contains decision trees and tables with information to guide pre-treatment evaluation and patient follow-up, as well as indications and conditions of use of bisphosphonates. In 2007, the regional cancer network of Rhône-Alpes, ONCORA, formed a working group (GIP ONCORA) to elaborate the guideline.

There is a wide variety of conditions in this broad spectrum. In some cases, the dissemination in the CNS is limited to the optic nerves and spinal cord. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and the NMO spectrum disorders have a predilection for the optic nerves and spinal cord. Clinical, MRI, cerebrospinal fluid and neuropathological features show that NMO could be considered as a distinct disease rather than as a variant of multiple sclerosis.

The most common symptom associated with retropharyngeal ganglioneuromas is dysphagia. We report a retropharyngeal ganglioneuroma with an unusual clinical presentation of neck stiffness and pain. A 42-year-old woman presented with incapacitating neck pain, neck stiffness, right upper extremity weakness, as well as dysphagia. Neurological workup was normal. Imaging revealed a hyperdense, ill-defined, diffuse right retropharyngeal mass suggestive of a possible nerve sheath tumor with no communication with the cervical spine. Surgical removal was uneventful and associated with a postoperative Horner's syndrome. In follow-up, dysphagia and neck symptoms improved. Retropharyngeal ganglioneuromas can occur in a wide age range of patients. Surgical excision via a cervical approach offers definitive therapy but may be associated with an iatrogenic Horner's syndrome for which the patients should be counseled prior to operative intervention. Neck pain is an atypical symptom that needs to be worked up to rule out a communication with the spinal column prior to surgical removal.

CD008686,0,21358309,0,"Structural bone changes in spondyloarthritis: mechanisms, clinical impact and therapeutic considerations.","Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is an inflammatory disease of the spine, the peripheral joints and the entheses and shares some clinical features with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Chronic inflammation of musculoskeletal structures leads to disease symptoms such as pain and stiffness and structural changes in the bone tissue. Furthermore, therapies for SpA are based on those for RA, which attempt to inhibit synovial inflammation that leads to retardation or even arrest of structural damage. However, in SpA, the bone tissue directly exposed to inflammation (osteitis) is the trabecular bone of the vertebrae, but not the cortical bone surface as in RA (synovitis). Therefore, the success of treatment strategies for structural changes in RA may not be appropriate for SpA. In this article, the authors discuss the pathophysiology of structural damage in SpA and concepts for the preservation of the physiologic bone architecture in patients with SpA."

CD008686,0,21329893,0,Solitary intradural extramedullary metastasis of renal cell carcinoma to the conus medullaris.,"We report the case of a 68-year-old man with a 6-year history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), who presented with severe low backache and paraparesis for a month before admission. In addition, he experienced urinary retention for 2 weeks. A spinal magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed the presence of an intradural extramedullary solitary mass at the conus medullaris. We performed a laminectomy and completely excised the tumor. The histopathological findings were suggestive of spinal metastasis of RCC. After the operation, the patient did not complain of backache and urinary retention, and paraparesis improved significantly. Spinal metastases of RCC are usually extradurally located. Intradural metastases of RCC are rare. Thus far, only six cases of RCC metastasizing to the cauda equina have been reported; however, RCC metastasis to the conus medullaris has not yet been reported. Conus medullaris lesions may cause symmetrical motor and sensory deficits accompanied by early autonomic system impairment. Surgery is the treatment of choice in cases of resectable RCC metastases, especially in cases of solitary metastasis."

He received radiotherapy for pain relief and for vertebral instability with incipient spinal stenosis, but additional targeted systemic therapy was intended. Therefore, multiple attempts at minimally invasive and open biopsies for histological characterisation of the bone metastases were performed, but failed to provide a conclusive specimen, although CT, MRI and bone scintigraphy were used for biopsy planning. Only histopathological analysis of an (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT-guided additional biopsy at a site with high metabolic activity yielded the final diagnosis of bone metastases of a neuroendocrine small cell cancer of unknown origin; hence, the patient had a third malignancy requiring a different therapy regimen and diagnostic work-up."

They provide rapid pain relief and the restoration of spinal stability. In the cervical spine, attempts have been made to use cement augmentation for these indications. However, the cervical spine's anatomy complicates the transpedicular approach, as well as the pre-formation of a vertebral body cavity and the application of bone cement. We report the case of a 46-year-old woman suffering from symptomatic C2 and C5 osteolysis caused by metastatic breast cancer. Following a surgical staging and classification (Tokuhashi-Score) that indicated palliative procedures, we performed a C2 and C5 kyphoplasty using one minimal-invasive anterior approach through a small incision. We observed an uneventful procedure and postoperative course as well as immediate pain relief and patient mobilization. Last patient follow-up at 3 months showed an excellent outcome. Our observations showed cervical spine kyphoplasty via a minimally invasive anterior approach to be feasible, successful and safe surgical method in the interdisciplinary palliative treatment."

Occasionally, however, a large ganglionic cyst of the hip area is observed that becomes symptomatic following compression of adjacent neurovascular bundles. In this report, the authors describe a 51-year-old man with symptoms of sciatica caused by a giant ganglionic cyst of the posterior hip joint. Because of its intermuscular location, the cyst was not palpable, and was probably misdiagnosed previously as a herniated disc of the lumbar spine. After resection of the cyst, the patient's symptoms resolved completely.

CD008686,0,21285392,0,The role of RANK-ligand inhibition in cancer: the story of denosumab.,"The diagnosis of bone metastases is an event with certain consequences for the patient. They often mean pain and can also mean pathological fractures, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression, all synonymous with a diminished quality of life and often also hospitalization. Since the advent of the intravenous bisphosphonates, things began to look a bit brighter for patients with bone metastases-bone destruction was kept at bay a little longer. The next generation of bone metastasis treatments is well on its way in clinical development, and among them, the most advanced drug is denosumab. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclast maturation, activation, and function by binding to receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand, with the final result being a reduced rate of bone resorption. In this review, we give an overview of relevant preclinical and clinical data regarding the use of denosumab in patients with solid tumors in general and prostate cancer in particular."

CD008686,0,21271647,0,Back to the future: proceedings from the 2010 NF Conference.,"The neurofibromatoses (NF) encompass the rare diseases NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis. The NFs affect 100,000 Americans; over 2 million persons worldwide; and are caused by mutation of tumor suppressor genes. Individuals with NF1 in particular may develop tumors anywhere in the nervous system; additional manifestations can include learning disabilities, bone dysplasia, cardiovascular defects, unmanageable pain, and physical disfigurement. Ultimately, the NFs can cause blindness, deafness, severe morbidity, and increased mortality and NF1 includes a risk of malignant cancer. Today there is no treatment for the NFs (other than symptomatic); however, research efforts to understand these genetic conditions have made tremendous strides in the past few years. Progress is being made on all fronts, from discovery studies-understanding the molecular signaling deficits that cause the manifestations of NF-to the growth of preclinical drug screening initiatives and the emergence of a number of clinical trials. An important element in fuelling this progress is the sharing of knowledge, and to this end, for over 20 years the Children's Tumor Foundation has convened an annual NF Conference, bringing together NF professionals to share ideas and build collaborations. The 2010 NF Conference held in Baltimore, MD June 5-8, 2010 hosted over 300 NF researchers and clinicians. This paper provides a synthesis of the highlights presented at the Conference and as such, is a ""state-of-the-field"" for NF research in 2010."

This rare anomaly, which should be differentiated from other pathological conditions (destructive processes, tumors, metastases, inactivate atrophy), was discovered during the MRI examination of his lumbosacral (LS) spine which the patient underwent due to deterioration of chronic low back pain. His right psoas muscle was hypertrophic. CT examination of his abdomen has shown the identical finding. The MRI examination of his LS spine has shown the intensive and extensive degenerative changes. Besides the hypoplasia of the lower portion of his left psoas muscle, the radiological examinations of the LS spine (MRI) and abdomen (CT) have not shown any other congenital anomalies.

The disease is common in the West, but little if any information is available on its existence in the Arab world, including Saudi Arabia. We present four cases of Saudi patients with Paget disease with variable presentations. The first case, a 63-year-old woman with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, presented with bone, shoulder and chest wall pain and foci of uptake in the ribs and skull that were thought to be metastases, indicating the possibility of diagnostic difficulty in a patient with history of malignancy. Bone biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Paget disease. The second case was a 47-year-old asymptomatic woman with an elevated alkaline phosphatase of 427 U/L, a common presentation but at an unusual age. Plain x-rays and bone scan confirmed the diagnosis. The third case was a 43-year-old man who presented with hearing impairment and right knee osteoarthritis, unusual presentations at a young age leading to a delay in diagnosis. The fourth case was a 45-year-old man who presented with sacroiliac pain and normal biochemical values, including a normal alkaline phosphatase. Bone biopsy unexpectedly revealed features of Paget disease, which evolved over time into a classical form. A common feature in all except the first case was the relatively young age. Paget disease does exist in Saudi Arabia, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of similar cases."

CD008686,0,21206517,0,Improving management of patients with advanced cancer.,"Development of bone metastases in patients with advanced cancer is associated with skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, the requirement for surgery or palliative radiotherapy to bone, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Skeletal morbidity may reduce patient mobility, limit functional independence, and impair quality of life (QOL). Proactive management of new or worsening bone pain or motor impairment is crucial because of the potential for rapid progression of symptoms. Administration of bisphosphonate therapy as a monthly infusion to patients with bone metastases prevents or delays the onset and reduces the frequency of SREs and provides clinically meaningful improvements in bone pain and QOL. In addition to administration of therapy, the monthly infusion visit allows a dedicated team of healthcare professionals to regularly assess SREs, response to therapy, adverse events (AEs), QOL, and adherence to oral medications and supplements. The continuity of care that occurs during the monthly infusion visit provides oncology nurses with an opportunity to educate patients about effective strategies to manage SREs and AEs. In addition, regular interaction provides oncology nurses with an opportunity to recognize and proactively address subtle changes in the patients' medical condition. Using a multidisciplinary medical team also eliminates barriers between the various healthcare professionals involved in patient management. Consequently, the monthly infusion visit can result in effective patient management and improved clinical outcomes in patients with malignant bone disease."

We present the case of an 18-year-old girl, who had one-year lower back pain and one-month lower limb weakness. Magnetic resonance images of the spinal cord showed an intramedullary mass from level T8 to T10, which was then radically removed. Histology revealed an anaplastic oligodendroglioma. The patient was treated with radiotherapy postoperatively. Eight months after the treatment, follow-up magnetic resonance images disclosed an enhancing intramedullary mass at level T4-T8; recurrence of the tumor was therefore diagnosed. Maximum surgical removal of the recurrent tumor was performed, diagnosis of anaplastic oligodendroglioma was made, and a chromosome 1p deletion was determined by FISH. After treatment with temozolomide for six months, the patient had a remarkable improvement of her lower limb symptoms, and complete imaging regression of the residual tumor showed no evidence of recurrence at any other sites. The most recent MRI of brain and spinal cord showed postoperative changes without evidence of tumor recurrence of the spine and oligodendrogliomatosis along the cerebral-spinal axis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a recurrent anaplastic oligodendroglioma with 1p deletion occurring in the spinal cord.

CD008686,0,21150183,0,Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma: an overview of systematic reviews.,"Individual studies rarely provide definitive answers to questions related to the effects of treatments. Whether the treatment is associated with more good than harm is best answered by considering the totality of evidence on the topic through the methodology of systematic reviews. The objective of this overview is to summarize all existing systematic reviews on treatments in multiple myeloma (MM), which accounts for 14% of new cases of hematological malignancies each year. Therefore, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched to identify systematic reviews of interventions. Data were extracted on patients, interventions, control and outcomes. Methodological quality of the systematic reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR assessment tool. Eleven systematic reviews on treatment of MM were included in the overview. Ten addressed seven unique questions and also performed a meta-analysis. One addressed 21 clinical questions related to treatment decisions in myeloma. The quality of systematic reviews varied. The results from the overview show that early treatment does not offer survival benefit. Thalidomide is associated with improved survival when added to standard chemotherapy regimens as induction or maintenance therapy but at the expense of an increased risk of serious adverse events, such as venous thromboembolism. High-dose therapy with single autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHCT) is associated with superior event-free but not overall survival compared to chemotherapy. Tandem AHCT does not prolong survival but is associated with better event-free survival in comparison to single AHCT. In addition, combination treatment with bisphosphonates reduces pathological vertebral fractures and pain, but does not prolong survival. We found no systematic review evaluating the effects of other novel agents, such as bortezomib or lenalidomide, as single agents or in combinations. Several key clinical questions have been successfully answered by conducting systematic reviews. However, currently many questions of importance for the management of patients with myeloma continue to be dealt with in individual studies instead of synthesized evidence. There is urgent need to perform research synthesis of data related to the effects of novel agents."

CD008686,0,21142465,0,Sacral tumor resection and the impact on pelvic incidence.,"pelvic incidence (PI) directly regulates lumbar lordosis and is a key determinant of sagittal spinal balance in normal and diseased states. Pelvic incidence is defined as the angle between the line perpendicular to the S-1 endplate at its midpoint and the line connecting this point to a line bisecting the center of the femoral heads. It reflects an anatomical value that increases with growth during childhood but remains constant in adulthood. It is not altered by changes in patient position or after traditional lumbosacral spinal surgery. There are only 2 reports of PI being altered in adults, both in cases of sacral fractures resulting in lumbopelvic dissociation and sacroiliac (SI) joint instability. En bloc sacral amputation and sacrectomy are surgical techniques used for resection of certain bony malignancies of the sacrum. High, mid, and low sacral amputations result in preservation of some or the entire SI joint. Total sacrectomy results in complete disruption of the SI joint. The purpose of this study was to determine if PI is altered as a result of total or subtotal sacral resection."

Results are satisfying though surgery can be challenging for patients and surgeons due to its invasiveness. A less invasive transnasal approach could provide a sufficient extent of resection with less collateral damage. The technique of transnasal endoscopic odontoid resection is demonstrated by a case series of three patients. A fully endoscopic transnasal odontoid resection was conducted by use of CT-based neuronavigation. A complete odontoid resection succeeded in all patients. Symptoms such as dysarthria, swallowing disturbance, salivary retention, myelopathic gait disturbances, neck pain, and tetraparesis improved in all patients markedly. Transnasal endoscopic odontoid resection is a feasible alternative to the transoral technique. It leaves the oropharynx intact, which could result in lower approach related complications especially in patients with bulbar symptoms."
CD008686,0,21121746,0,Cervicothoracic junction kyphosis: surgical reconstruction with pedicle subtraction osteotomy and Smith-Petersen osteotomy. Presented at the 2009 Joint Spine Section Meeting. Clinical article.,"Sagittal plane deformities can be subdivided into kyphotic and lordotic forms and further characterized according to their global or regional (focal) presentation. Regional deformities of a significant magnitude constitute a gibbous deformity. Pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) and interlaminar Smith-Petersen osteotomies have been used to correct sagittal plane deformities in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. By resecting a portion of the vertebral body and closing in the gap of this vertebra, the spine is placed in local lordosis and kyphosis is corrected. These osteotomies have generally been carried out in the lumbar or less frequently in the thoracic area. While PSO has been performed in the mid and lower thoracic spine, there have been no case series of patients undergoing PSO at the CTJ. Specifically, a PSO approach that addresses the challenges of the CTJ is needed. Here, the authors review their case series of PSOs performed in the CTJ. Their goal in the treatment of these patients was to correct the regional CTJ kyphosis, restore forward gaze, and reduce the pain associated with the deformity."

The authors decided to evaluate occurrence according to etiology and permanent consequences after treatment in patients that were treated at the Department of Neurosurgery P. J. Safarik University Hospital in Kosice during 12 years (1996-2007). 95 patients from the 101 members file had SCE caused by disc herniation or spinal stenosis. Rare etiology of SCE was found in the six cases: three had traumatic origin, one spinal epidural abscess, one tumor. SCE developed after surgery of intervetebral disc herniation in one patient. Patients underwent control examination or answered by a questionnaire one year from the beginning of SCE or later. Three patients with traumatic SCE had the moderate residual problems. One patient suffered from intermittent pain, perianogenital hypesthesia had two patients, light motor deficit another one. One patient needs to use increased abdominal pressure for urination. Nobody from this subgroup had sexual difficulties or problems with anal spincters' control. The result of treatment patient with SCE caused by spinal epidural abscess was unfavourable. Permanent pain, perianogenital hypesthesia, hard motor deficit and loss of sexual functions persisted. Patient with oncological SCE had deficit in every traced signs. Similar clinical picture was in a patient with postoperative SCE, but residual deficit was moderate."

Distant skeletal metastasis is reported very rarely and the vertebral column is the most common site. A 58-year-old male smoker presented with pain and massive swelling of the left scapula for six months. He also noticed a slowly-growing painful ulcerated lesion on the outer aspect of the right lower lip for last two years. Biopsy from the lip ulcer, as well as cytologic smears from the scapular mass, revealed features of squamous cell carcinoma. Though no neck node was detected, patient was found to have extensive skeletal metastasis on whole body bone scan. It is rare as well as clinically appealing to have such disfiguring symptomatic massive scapular metastasis as the chief presenting feature in carcinoma of the lip."
CD008686,0,21118835,0,Chest wall bleeding with giant intrathoracic meningocele in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"We report the case of a 66-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 who developed chest wall bleeding with severe scoliosis and a giant intrathoracic meningocele. She was brought to the emergency department with acute-onset of left-sided chest pain and clinical signs of hypovolemia. Bleeding control was difficult in the first operation because the tissue was friable and there were multiple subcutaneous bleeding points. During the first operation, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation, which required immediate management; therefore, the surgery was aborted and a repeat surgery was performed later to stop the bleeding. The major cause of bleeding was presumed to be the mechanical stretching of the intercostal arteries and branches of the internal thoracic artery secondary to the severe deformity of the thoracic vertebra and ribs. The massive bleeding remained as a hematoma and did not lead to development of hemothorax. This was believed to be because the giant intrathoracic meningocele supported the expansion of the hematoma and prevented the perforation of the visceral pleura. After the second operation, the hematoma shrunk gradually; however, the patient required ventilatory support because the decrease in the size of the hematoma was accompanied by the expansion of the meningocele."

CD008686,0,21111244,0,Implications of bone metastases and the benefits of bone-targeted therapy.,"Several cancers, including those originating in the breast, prostate, and lung, exhibit a propensity to metastasize to bone, resulting in debilitating skeletal complications. These sequelae, such as intractable pain, pathologic fractures, spinal compression, and hypercalcemia, greatly erode the patients' quality of life. Bisphosphonates, a class of antiresorptive drugs, are now the mainstay of the treatment of skeletal-related events in myeloma bone disease and many solid cancers with bone metastases. Current evidence indicates that newer-generation nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, particularly zoledronic acid, are potent inhibitors of bone resorption. In addition, increased understanding of the pathogenesis of bone metastasis has resulted in the development of several bone-targeted therapies including a monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand (RANKL). In this review, clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of currently available bone-targeted therapies including bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody in the treatment of bone metastasis due to breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and multiple myeloma bone disease will be summarized."

CD008686,0,21107993,0,Complications related to the placement of an intraventricular chemotherapy device.,"Leptomeningeal meningitis occurs in 4-15% of patients with solid tumors. It is a severe disease which seriously affects patients' neurological status and quality of life. Intrathecal chemotherapy increases survival and improves quality of life. Administration of drugs by lumbar puncture causes pain and discomfort, reducing therapeutic compliance. Implantation of an intraventricular catheter fixed to a subcutaneous reservoir overcomes these drawbacks. To evaluate complications compared with implantation of an intraventricular chemotherapy device, between June 2006 and December 2009, 50 patients with a solid tumor underwent implantation of a catheter to treat leptomeningeal metastases. Clinical evaluation of all patients was performed every two weeks and magnetic resonance imaging at one month then every three months. Surgical data (operative time, blood loss) and all clinical and radiological complications were prospectively monitored. All patients underwent surgery with local anesthesia. The mean operative time was 15 min, with no complication during surgery. We report five complications (10%) during the follow-up; three required the removal of the device and another was lethal. There was no case of misplacement or obstruction of the catheter. Intraventricular chemotherapy is an effective treatment procedure which improves therapeutic compliance with acceptable morbidity."

A 57 year old woman diagnosed with glioblastoma developed a subacute progressive history of bilateral symmetric numbness of her fingers and toes, belt-type neuropathic pain, a left facial droop and upper and lower extremity muscle weakness. There was no evidence of a tumor mass or leptomeningeal disease in the spine. Electrophysiological studies confirmed the diagnosis. Although rare, GBS should be considered in primary brain tumor patients with generalized acute-subacute progressive weakness that is inconsistent with the location of their tumor, particularly if they are also on chemotherapy contributing to their immunosuppressive state."

Most cases of back pain are non-specific and self-limiting. In children and adolescents, pain is usually related to the posterior elements of the spine and disc-related problems are rare. Serious pathology, including malignancy and infection needs to be excluded.

CD008686,0,21091310,0,Alemtuzumab in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by CNS inflammation, demyelination and cellular damage with atrophy. Most patients with MS initially present with a relapsing-remitting course, with periodic episodes of neurologic symptomatology that do not follow a predictable pattern. In order to maintain a stable clinical course, it is felt to be important to control the number and severity of relapses, as disability, at least in part, is a cumulative effect of damage from multiple lesions within the brain and spinal cord. Historically, MS has not been considered curable, because the immune system could not be adequately normalized over the course of a lifetime. Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H; Campath(®), Genzyme, MA, USA) has recently been investigated in a Phase II clinical trial in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. The results observed in the study are very encouraging and multiple insights have been made into the nature of autoimmunity in general based on the clinical response to this monoclonal antibody. Enrollment in two pivotal Phase III clinical trials of alemtuzumab in MS is now complete."

CD008686,0,21053876,0,A nonphosphaturic mesenchymal tumor mixed connective tissue variant of the sacrum.,"Tumor-induced or oncogenic osteomalacia is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by overproduction of fibroblast growth factor-23 as a phosphaturic agent and renal phosphate wasting. A range of predominantly mesenchymal neoplasms have been associated with tumor-induced osteomalacia and classified as phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor mixed connective tissues. However, phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor mixed connective tissues could be nonphosphaturic in the first stage of the disease, either because the tumors are resected early in the clinical course or because the patient's osteomalacia was attributed to another cause. This article presents a case of a 42-year-old woman with a 2-year history of low back and right leg pain. Laboratory examinations including serum and urine calcium and phosphorous were within normal values. Imaging of the lumbar spine and pelvis showed an osteolytic lesion occupying the right sacral wing. Histology was unclear. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis for fibroblast growth factor-23 was positive and confirmed the diagnosis of phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor mixed connective tissues. Preoperative selective arterial embolization and complete intralesional excision, bone grafting, and instrumented fusion from L4 to L5 to the iliac wings bilaterally was performed. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Neurological deficits were not observed. A lumbopelvic corset was applied for 3 months. At 12 months, the patient was asymptomatic.

The aetiology and the intensity of the symptoms may defer significantly. The effectiveness of the surgical treatment remains obscure. Our purpose, through this systematic review is to evaluate the results of surgical treatment of coccygectomy. Literature retrieval was performed by the use of the PubMed searching engine utilising the terms 'coccygodynia-coccygectomy' in the English language from January 1980 to January 2010. Case reports and tumour related case series were excluded as well as articles published in other languages. In total 24 manuscripts were analyzed. Only 2 of them were prospective studies whereas 22 were retrospective case series; five were classified as Level III studies and the remaining as Level IV studies. In total, 671 patients with coccygodynia underwent coccygectomy following failed conservative management. The sex ratio, male/female was 1:4.4. The most popular aetiology for coccygodynia was direct trauma in 270 patients. 504 of the patients reported an excellent/good outcome following the procedure. There were 9 deep and 47 superficial infections. Other complications included two haematomas, six delayed wound healings and nine wound dehiscence. The overall complication rate was 11%. Patients with history of spinal or rectal disorders, as well as idiopathic or with compensation issues, had less predictable outcome than those with history of trauma or childbirth. Coccygectomy can provide pain relief to as high as 85% of the cases. The most common reported complication was wound infection."

CD008686,0,20977958,0,Imaging the back pain patient.,"Imaging is an integral part of the clinical examination of the patient with back pain; it is, however, often used excessively and without consideration of the underlying literature. The primary role of imaging is the identification of systemic disease as a cause of the back or limb pain; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excels at this. Systemic disease as a cause of back or limb pain is, however, rare. Most back and radiating limb pain is of benign nature, owing to degenerative phenomena. There is no role for imaging in the initial evaluation of the patient with back pain in the absence of signs or symptoms of systemic disease. When conservative care fails, imaging may be undertaken with due consideration of its risks: labeling the patient as suffering from a degenerative disease, cost, radiation exposure, and provoking unwarranted minimally invasive or surgical intervention. Imaging can well depict disc degeneration and disc herniation. Imaging can suggest the presence of discogenic pain, but the lack of a pathoanatomic gold standard obviates any definitive conclusions. The imaging natural history of disc herniation is resolution. There is very poor correlation between imaging findings of disc herniation and the clinical presentation or course. Psychosocial factors predict functional disability due to disc herniation better than imaging. Imaging with MRI, computed tomography (CT), or CT myelography can readily identify central canal, lateral recess, or foraminal compromise. Only when an imaging finding is concordant with the patient's pain pattern or neurologic deficit can causation be considered. The zygapophysial (facet) and sacroiliac joint are thought to be responsible for axial back pain, although with less frequency than the disc. Imaging findings of the structural changes of osteoarthritis do not correlate with pain production. Physiologic imaging, either with single-photon emission CT bone scan, heavily T2-weighted MRI sequences (short-tau inversion recovery), or gadolinium enhancement, can detect inflammation and are more predictive of an axial pain generator."

Demyelinating as well as neoplastic spinal cord diseases can cause paresthesia, progressive sensomotoric deficits and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Imaging of the spine, especially with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is an essential component in the diagnostic assessment of myelopathy and makes a substantial contribution to achieving the correct diagnosis. Although intramedullary neoplasms are far less common than demyelinating spinal cord diseases, radiologists should be familiar with the three most common entities, astrocytoma, ependymoma and hemangioblastoma, which represent over 70% of all spinal cord neoplasms. An early diagnosis and therapy is essential with neoplastic and demyelinating spinal cord diseases to hold residual neurological deficits as low as possible."

Apart from the neonatal period, where ultrasound is used as the primary method for investigation of closed spinal dysraphia, radiography is still considered to be the first choice examination, which nevertheless should only be carried out after a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination. For targeted follow-up and especially exclusion of neoplasms, MRI is the method of choice in most cases.

We investigated TNF-α and IL-6 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with radicular pain caused by lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). A total of 30 LSS patients and 10 age-matched controls were examined. CSF samples were obtained adjacent to the level of stenosis in 30 LSS patients, and at the L4-L5 level in the 10 control patients. TNF-α and IL-6 levels in the samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We compared the amounts of TNF-α and IL-6 with severity of pain (low back and leg pain), walking ability, and severity of stenosis (cross-sectional area of dural space). The concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in LSS patients than in controls, but TNF-α levels were beneath the limit of detection. There was no correlation between IL-6 levels and severity of pain or walking ability (p > 0.05). However, there was a significant correlation between IL-6 levels and severity of stenosis (p < 0.05). The current study showed that the increased CSF IL-6 levels in LSS patients with radicular pain were not correlated with pain severity; although not proven in this study, the increase in CSF IL-6 concentration could indicate pathological nerve damage or degeneration of lumbar radiculopathy represented by the severity of stenosis."

Recent evidence suggests that depressive symptoms and pain, as interacting factors, have an effect on the circulating levels of inflammatory markers relevant to coronary artery disease. Our previous work showed a higher serum level of an inflammatory marker tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) in patients with cLBP, which did not correlate with intensity of low back pain alone. In the present study we investigated the cross-sectional associations of depressive symptoms, low back pain and their interaction with circulating levels of TNFα."

We report a 41-year-old woman with a family history of anencephaly, spina bifida, and scoliosis who presented with increasing left-sided mid-thoracic pain uncontrolled by her usual pain medication for symptomatic moderate rotary scoliosis. A magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a paravertebral saccular lesion at the level of the sixth thoracic vertebra. The 2.1×1.5×1.3 cm T6 paravertebral cyst was excised through a left thoracotomy. The final microscopic diagnosis and immunohistochemistry revealed endosalpingiosis. On the basis of histology, immunohistochemical staining characteristics, and the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors, we conclude that our patient with a benign mediastinal paravertebral endosalpingiotic müllerian cyst had a lesion identical to those described by Hattori, Thomas-de-Montpreville and Dulmet, and Businger et al.

CD008686,0,20868241,0,Anterior cervical corpectomy: review and comparison of results using titanium mesh cages and carbon fibre reinforced polymer cages.,"Different types of cages have recently become available for reconstruction following anterior cervical corpectomy. We review the results using titanium mesh cages (TMC) and stackable CFRP (carbon fibre reinforced polymer) cages. Forty-two patients who underwent anterior cervical corpectomy between November 2001 and September 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Pathologies included cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), cervical radiculopathy, OPLL (ossified posterior longitudinal ligament), metastasis/primary bone tumour, rheumatoid arthritis and deformity correction. All patients were evaluated clinically and radiologically. Outcome was assessed on the basis of the Odom's criteria, neck disability index (NDI) and myelopathy disability index (MDI). Mean age was 60 years and mean follow-up was 1½ years. Majority of the patients had single-level corpectomy. Twenty-three patients had TMC cages while 19 patients had CFRP cages. The mean subsidence noted with TMC cage was 1.91 mm, while with the stackable CFRP cage it was 0.5 mm. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). However, there was no statistically significant correlation noted between subsidence and clinical outcome (p > 0.05) or between subsidence and post-operative sagittal alignment (p > 0.05) in either of the groups. Three patients had significant subsidence (> 3 mm), one of whom was symptomatic. There were no hardware-related complications. On the basis of the Odom's criterion, 9 patients (21.4%) had an excellent outcome, 14 patients (33.3%) had a good outcome, 9 patients (21.4%) had a fair outcome and 5 patients (11.9%) had a poor outcome, i.e. symptoms and signs unchanged or exacerbated. Mean post-operative NDI was 26.27% and mean post-operative MDI was 19.31%. Fusion was noted in all 42 cases. Both TMC and stackable CFRP cages provide solid anterior column reconstruction with good outcome following anterior cervical corpectomy. However, more subsidence is noted with TMC cages though this might not significantly alter the clinical outcome unless the subsidence is significant (>3 mm)."

CD008686,0,20837191,0,Gout: epitome of painful arthritis.,"Arthritic pain and disability are at or near the top of the list of reasons adult patients seek medical attention. At least 47.8 million US residents have arthritis. In Europe, the magnitude of the problem is similar, affecting 8 million in the United Kingdom and 108 million across the continent. Osteoarthritis is by far the most common form of arthritis. In a regional UK study, nearly half of adults 50 years or older reported some form of osteoarthritic knee pain over a 1-year period. Among the arthritides, gout is notable for the agonizing nature and unique pathogenesis of the pain it generates. Gout is the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis among men and postmenopausal women. Because of the atypical nature of some of its clinical manifestations, gout can present serious diagnostic challenges for practicing physicians. In recent years, knowledge about gout's pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis has advanced on a broad front. Genetic variants within a newly identified transport gene, SLC2A9, have been associated with a low fractional excretion of uric acid and the presence of gout in several population samples. The SLC2A9 gene encodes glucose transporter 9-a unique hexose and high-capacity urate transporter. In addition, human ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G2 (ABCG2), encoded by the ABCG2 gene, has been found to mediate renal urate secretion. Introduction of a mutation encoded in a model system by a common single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2231142, resulted in a 53% reduction in urate transport rates compared with wild-type ABCG2. Based on a large population study, it has been estimated that at least 10% of all gout cases in white persons may be attributable to this single nucleotide polymorphism causal genetic variant. Of the various categories of arthritis, the crystal-induced arthropathies, gout and pseudogout, are manifested by acute inflammation and tissue damage arising from deposition in joints and periarticular tissues of monosodium urate (MSU), calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate, or basic calcium phosphate crystals. The innate immune system rapidly detects invading pathogenic microbes and nonmicrobial ""danger signals"" such as MSU crystals. When these crystals are deposited in synovial tissues, NLR proteins (NOD-like receptors) form multiprotein complexes known as inflammasomes that trigger secretion of inflammation-producing cytokines like interleukin-1β and interleukin-18. Usually, gout can be diagnosed by medical history, physical examination, and presence of hyperuricemia (urate >416 μmol/L). However, a urate concentration less than 416 does not by itself rule out gout. Confirmation of the diagnosis by identification of typical MSU crystals in aspirated synovial fluid is definitive. Analysis of joint fluid is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis, which can rapidly become lethal. Because of its special ability to identify and quantitate urate deposits in peripheral tissues, dual-energy computed tomography should prove valuable in the differential diagnosis of gout. Gout mimics a variety of illnesses; for example, spinal gout may masquerade as metastatic cancer, epidural abscess, and nerve compression syndrome."

CD008686,0,20845613,0,[Successful treatment of angiomatosis with thalidomide and interferon alpha. A description of five cases and overview of treatment of angiomatosis and proliferating hemangiomas].,"Our paper describes 5 patients with a vascular malformation - angiomatosis. In the first patient, a young man, angiomatosis affected the stomach, intestine, the area of mesenterium and retroperitoneum as well as mediastinum. Angiomatous mass had invaded pelvic bones and vertebrae. Treatment was initiated with interferon alpha in a maximum tolerated dose of 3 million units 3 times a week. Because of low efficacy of interferon alpha, thalidomide was added at a dose of 100 mg per day. Bone pain disappeared following a few applications of zoledronate administered in regular monthly intervals. After 3 years of concomitant administration of interferon alpha and thalidomide, we changed the regimen due to adverse effects and are administering thalidomide and interferon alternatively in 4-monthly intervals. Treatment has resulted in 50% reduction, according to imaging, of angiomatous mass, reduced intensity of disseminated intravascular coagulation and disappearance of clinical signs. The second was a case of multiple angiomatosis affecting the intestine only (multiple intestinal angiodysplasias) where we used thalidomide monotherapy. This treatment reduced blood losses and haemoglobin concentrations rose to normal levels. This male patient had consumed 120 transfusion units per year before the initiation of thalidomide. The third case was a slowly progressing vascular malformation of the face. This vascular malformation troubled its sufferer by spontaneous shortening that could not be resolved surgically because of its fragility. Two years of combined treatment with interferon a 6 million unites 3 times a week and thalidomide 100 mg daily led to a reduction and flattening of the malformation, paling of its colour and ceasing of spontaneous bleeding. This development enabled minor surgery--partial excision of this large vascular malformation. Histology examination confirmed that there was no evidence of new capillary formation. Histological examination thus confirmed efficacy of the treatment. The fourth case involved a patient with large vascular malformations affecting supraclavicular region of the neck and nape in whom radiotherapy was applied (54 Gy) leading to a reduction of the malformation mass by a at least 50%. The fifth is a case of an extensive periorbital lymphangioma that diminished following treatment with interferon alpha. These cases illustrate the benefits of combined treatment including thalidomide and interferon alpha in patients with multiple angiomatosis or large proliferating hemangioma (vascular malformation). If combined treatment with thalidomide and interferon a is not possible, it is beneficial to use thalidomide monotherapy. Radiotherapy is another alternative, although it is necessary to apply doses exceeding 50 Gy which may not be always possible."

CD008686,0,20840379,0,Acute transverse myelitis and antiphospholipid antibodies in lupus. No evidence for anticoagulation.,"Current views suggest that prothrombotic properties of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) have a role in the development of acute transverse myelitis (ATM) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Consequently, empiric anticoagulation may be included in these patients' treatment. We performed a systemic review of the literature to explore the clinical value of the presence of aPL in patients with lupus myelitis and the possible effectiveness of anticoagulation. We analyzed clinical and laboratory data extracted from published cases of SLE-associated ATM, fulfilling the Transverse Myelitis Consortium Working Group diagnostic criteria, that provided information on aPL. We report on a total of 70 patients. aPL, detected upon ATM onset in 54% of patients, neither predicted the involvement of the thoracic part of the spine, which has been postulated to reflect a predominantly thrombosis-induced injury, nor correlated with relapsing ATM, additional lupus CNS manifestations, or worse clinical outcome. An unfavorable outcome could be predicted by paralysis (P=0.02) and abnormal CSF findings at presentation (P=0.02). Whilst all patients received major immunosuppressive regimens, severe neurologic impairment (estimated Expanded Disability Status Scale score>7) was found primarily in aPL-negative patients (P=0.03). Anticoagulation was more frequently applied in aPL-positive patients (P=0.04), but any additional therapeutic effect was not evident. Detection of circulating aPL at ATM onset appears unreliable to suggest a thrombotic cause and perhaps not enough to dictate therapeutic anticoagulation. Registry creation of ATM in patients with SLE is needed to obtain more definite answers on the role of aPL in this condition."
CD008686,0,20826067,0,NK-1-receptor-mediated lesion of spinal post-synaptic dorsal column neurons might improve intractable visceral pain of cancer origin.,"The cancer-related visceral pain has traditionally been frustrating to treat by either medical or surgical means. Recent investigations from bench and bedside have suggested that a critical visceral nociceptive pathway originates from post-synaptic dorsal column (PSDC) neurons located in the central area of the spinal-cord. Interruption of the PSDC pathway using different surgical approaches effectively relieves intractable visceral pain in cancer patients. However, the indications of surgical lesion of DC are very limited in clinical setting because of the surgical risks and complications. Thus, a means of high-specific pharmacological lesion of DC pathway is necessary. Some evidence has shown that spinal PSDC neurons start to express neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors after visceral stimulation, suggesting new targets for the development of pharmacological strategies for the control of visceral pain. Here, we present our hypothesis that the targeted cytoxin composed of substance P coupled to the cytotoxic ribosome inactivating protein, saporin, might selectively destroy spinal PSDC neurons expressing NK-1 receptors, which will lead to pharmacological interruption of PSDC pathway and will greatly improve intractable visceral pain of cancer origin. Based on the data from related research, we believe that the current therapy we propose might be one of the optimal pharmacological approaches to replace the neurosurgical interruption of DC pathway and could be used for cancer-related visceral pain in wider clinical indications."
CD008686,0,20825565,0,14. Coccygodynia.,"Coccygodynia is painful condition localized in the region of the coccyx. In most cases a traumatic etiology is present. In the idiopathic form other causes such as infections and tumor have to be excluded. Coccygodynia can also be the result of pain referred from visceral structures due to conditions such as disorders of the rectum, the colon sigmoideum, and the urogenital system. In case of a traumatic etiology the diagnosis is made based on the typical medical history whereby the pain is provoked by prolonged sitting and cycling. Lateral images of the coccyx are always indicated. The same is true for manual examination of the coccyx. In case of absence of provocation of the coccygeal pain by prolonged sitting and manual examination neurological causes such as lumbar disc hernias are a possible reason for the coccygodynia. In the acute phase the first choice of treatment are NSAIDs. Treatment for patients with severe pain in the chronic phase consists of manual therapy and/or a local injection of local anesthetic and corticosteroid into the painful segment (2 C+). Other interventional treatments such as intradiscal injections, ganglion impar block, radiofrequency treatment and caudal block are advised only under study conditions (0). Coccygectomy is not recommended because of long-term moderate results and the chance of major complications."

CD008686,0,20809755,0,Intramedullary spinal cord cavernous malformations.,"Although originally the subject of rare case reports, intramedullary spinal cord cavernous malformations (CMs) have recently surfaced in an increasing number of case series and natural history reports in the literature. The authors reviewed 27 publications with 352 patients to consolidate modern epidemiological, natural history, and clinical and surgical data to facilitate decision making when managing these challenging vascular malformations. The mean age at presentation was 42 years without a sex predilection. Thirty-eight percent of the cases were cervical, 57% thoracic, 4% lumbar, and 1% unspecified location. Nine percent of the patients had a family history of CNS CMs. Twenty-seven percent of the patients had an associated cranial CM. On presentation 63% of the patients had motor deficits, 65% had sensory deficits, 27% had pain, and 11% had bowel or bladder dysfunction. Presentation was acute in 30%, recurrent in 16%, and progressive in 54% of cases. An overall annual hemorrhage rate was calculated as 2.5% for 92 patients followed up for a total of 2571 patient-years. Across 24 reviewed surgical series, a 91% complete resection rate was found. Transient morbidity was seen in 36% of cases. Sixty-one percent of patients improved, 27% were unchanged, and 12% were worse at the long-term follow-up.

To study the clinical characteristics of these tumors, we reviewed the microsurgical management of 18 patients with dumbbell C1 and C2 schwannomas by the far lateral approach. Data regarding clinical manifestations, radiological findings and surgical results were analyzed retrospectively. Total and subtotal resection of the tumor was achieved in 15 and three patients, respectively. At the time of discharge, 12 patients showed improvement while five patients remained the same. The average follow-up duration was 43 months (range = 3-110 months); six of seven patients had recovery from local pain or numbness. With the exception of one patient with hemiplegia or hemiparesthesia preoperatively, all patients recovered within 6 months postoperatively. The far lateral approach offers adequate exposure and access with minimal neural manipulation for treating dumbbell C1 and C2 schwannomas, and is considered the preferred surgical approach for resection of these tumors located ventrally or ventrolaterally to the first two cervical vertebrae."
CD008686,0,20797890,0,[Dosimetric factors predictive of late toxicity in prostate cancer radiotherapy].,"Dose escalation in prostate cancer is made possible due to technological advances and to precise dose-volume constraints to limit normal tissue damage. This article is a literature review focusing on the correlations between exposure (doses and volumes) of organs at risk (OAR) and rectal, urinary, sexual and bone toxicity, as well as on mathematical models aiming at toxicity prediction. Dose-volume constraint recommendations are presented that have been shown to be associated with reduced rectal damage. Indeed, the clinical data is relatively strong for late rectal toxicity (bleeding), with constraints put on both the volume of the rectum receiving high doses (≥70 Gy) and the volume receiving intermediate doses (40 to 60 Gy). Predictive models of rectal toxicity (Normal Tissue Complication Probability) appear to accurately estimate toxicity risks. The correlations are much weaker for the bulb and the femoral heads, and nearly do not exist for the bladder. Further prospective studies are required, ideally taking into account patient-related risk factors (co-morbidities and their specific treatments), assays of normal tissue hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and mathematical models applied on 3D images acquired under the treatment machine (e.g. Cone Beam CT)."

Before advances in diagnostic modalities, prone tests were popularly performed in ophthalmology practices as provocative tests for detecting potentially occludable angles. In patients with a positive test result, direct observation shows that the anterior chamber shallows and the angle closes over time, compromising aqueous humor outflow facility. Furthermore, the degree of angle narrowing is proportional to the rise in IOP. A common scenario involving a prone position is spine surgery, which can last several hours with the patient unconscious."

CD008686,0,20722624,0,Prevention and treatment of bone metastases.,"Certain primary tumours including breast and prostate cancers have a particular propensity for metastasis to bone. Metastatic bone disease can have significant impact on morbidity and mortality of cancer patients. Skeletal-morbidity (spinal cord compression, hypercalcaemia, fracture, need for radiotherapy and surgery to bone) can be effectively reduced by bisphosphonates, a class of anti-resorptive drugs. They are also effective in relieving pain from bone metastases, and may improve survival in patients with accelerated bone resorption. Additionally, there is an exciting body of evidence that suggest these drugs may have anti-tumor effects that may be exploited to prevent or delay the development of bone metastases. Reported effects include inhibition of cancer cell migration, adhesion and invasion as well as anti-angiogenic and immunomodulating effects. The pre-clinical evidence is compelling, and some recently reported randomised clinical studies go part way to support their use in clinical practice at earlier stages of the disease to prevent bone metastases. However, further results are awaited before routine clinical use in the adjuvant setting can be recommended."

We describe an acquired neuropathy associated with cetuximab treatment in a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Our patient was treated with cetuximab from May to July 2008. In December 2008, he first noticed numbness in his feet. He progressed over the next 5 months to develop weakness in both legs, a lack of sensation up to his knees, pain in the dorsum of his feet with a burning sensation, and difficulty ambulating to the point of requiring a walker. He also had numbness in his fingertips and was unable to use his hands for fine movements. Electrodiagnostic studies demonstrated prolonged distal latencies, conduction block, and prolonged F-wave latencies, consistent with a diagnosis of definite CIDP according to EFNS/PNS criteria. Low amplitude potentials were noted in nerves of the lower extremities, indicative of secondary axonal loss. Extensive workup for an alternative cause was negative. He improved clinically after IVIG and corticosteroid treatment. We cannot strongly establish a causal relationship in this case, as 5 months elapsed between cetuximab treatment and the onset of neuropathic symptoms.

We report a case of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) in a 60-year-old Japanese man treated with MTX for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). SPTCL is a rare cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma characterized by involvement of subcutaneous fat mimicking panniculitis. The patient, who had been on MTX therapy for RA, manifested high fever and lumbago. Physical examination showed multiple subcutaneous nodules on the trunk including axillary and inguinal regions. Biopsy of the inguinal nodule showed profuse infiltration of CD8(+) T-cell lymphoma cells in the subcutaneous adipose tissues. A diagnosis of SPTCL was made according to the diagnostic criteria of World Health Organization classification. EBV-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization revealed that the lymphoma cells contained EBV genome. The cells were positive for EBV latent membrane protein 1, but not for EBNA2. After discontinuation of MTX, the nodules regressed spontaneously. Studies have reported that most MTX-LPDs are B-cell type lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. To the best of our knowledge, EBV-positive SPTCL has not been reported in patients receiving MTX. Our case emphasizes the importance of clinical and virological characterization of MTX-associated SPTCL."

In the majority of cases, the scoliosis is idiopathic, but it may be the manifestation of an occult spinal pathology. The clinical history and examination may elicit certain worrying features such as pain, neurological symptoms or an atypical curve pattern. These findings should prompt advanced imaging, as early and accurate detection of an underlying cause allows optimal planning and timing of surgery and helps reduce associated risks. The most common occult pathologies detected by advanced imaging are Arnold Chiari malformations, syringohydromyelia and closed spinal dysraphism such as diastematomyelia. Advanced imaging techniques, in particular multiplanar MRI, are also increasingly requested in children with known congenital scoliosis associated with spinal dysraphism and developmental causes of scoliosis such as neurofibromatosis and Klippel-Feil syndrome, as it allows superior delineation of the spinal column without the radiation risk. This review aims to examine the different imaging techniques currently used in the evaluation of scoliosis and provide a pictorial summary of the more common causes and associations."

Although they may have different origins, they may share the same symptoms, surgical approaches, and complications. An extension of these lesions along the posterior fossa cisterns, foramina, and spinal canal--usually involving various cranial nerves (CNs) and the vertebral and cerebellar arteries--poses a surgical challenge. The primary goals of both surgical and radiosurgical management of schwannomas in the CCJ are the preservation and restoration of function of the lower CNs, and of hearing and facial nerve function. The origins of schwannomas in the CCJ and their clinical presentation, surgical management, adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery, and outcomes in 36 patients treated at Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) are presented."

Progressive pulmonary function loss predisposes Pompe disease patients to an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, atelectasis, and all pulmonary infections. Given the impaired cough resulting from abdominal muscle weakness, patients with Pompe disease who undergo abdominal major surgery are prone to great risks of postoperative pulmonary complications. In our case, to optimize the patient's pulmonary toilet during the postoperative period, epidural block was provided as well as general anesthesia. Although she had a severe scoliotic spine and a worst pulmonary function test, the attempt of epidural block provided excellent pain control and pulmonary toilet care."

CD008686,0,20607538,0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty to treat painful myelomatous vertebral deposits-long-term efficacy outcomes.,"Developed for benign conditions including osteoporotic fractures and haemangiomas, vertebroplasty has since been employed in neoplastic lesions, including myeloma. Advances in myeloma treatments, yielding improved survival times, have led to an increasing need for effective therapies that improve quality of life. The first randomised trials of vertebroplasty to treat painful osteoporotic crush fractures have cast doubt of its benefit over a placebo procedure, with a proposed rationale that fracture healing over time may account for the non-superiority of the results. However, these findings cannot be extrapolated to myeloma where the pathology is one of progressive bony destruction coupled with failure of new bone formation. In this paper, we present the outcome data for myeloma patients treated at our tertiary referral centre over a 5-year period, focusing on both subjective and objective measures of efficacy and safety. Records were reviewed to extract pain score, function and analgesia pre/post-procedure. Where possible, patients were then contacted directly and asked to assess their benefit by grading change in pain score, analgesia use and mobility. Performance status was assessed using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale. Of the 26 patients treated for painful thoraco-lumbar lesions, 77% reported improved pain score (P < 0.003). Analgesia reduction, better mobility and improved performance status were also seen. Our data support the consideration of vertebroplasty as a first-line treatment for painful myelomatous vertebral disease. Prospective randomised studies are now required to further define its role."
CD008686,0,20606622,0,Classification of juvenile spondyloarthritis: Enthesitis-related arthritis and beyond.,"Spondyloarthritis (SpA) refers to a spectrum of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases with overlapping features, which differ from other types of inflammatory arthritis in genetic predisposition, pathogenesis and outcome. SpA frequently involves the axial skeleton, and can result in abnormal bone formation with eventual ankylosis of the spine, resulting in substantial disability. SpA often begins as an 'undifferentiated' disease, the presentation of which differs in children and adults; most notably, spinal involvement is uncommon, while hip arthritis and enthesitis are frequently seen in juvenile-onset disease. Currently, the classification of SpA in adults and children is approached differently. Using the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) system for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, most childhood SpA is classified as enthesitis-related arthritis. However, in contrast to adult SpA classification, the presence of, or a family history of, psoriasis dictates a separate category of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. More importantly, the ILAR system does not specifically recognize the presence of axial disease in juvenile SpA. Resolution of these issues will improve communication and the transitioning of patients from pediatric to adult clinics, will facilitate research in genetics and pathogenesis, and will be particularly important in the evaluation of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and other biologic agents for early, axial SpA."

An elderly male patient with a history of controlled hypertension initially experienced chest pain. A computed tomographic scan revealed aortic intramural hematoma; thus, conservative therapy was performed. One and a half months later, tumors in both adrenal glands and the lumbar vertebra were discovered. The primary site was not identified, and the patient died following septic shock 1 month later. An autopsy revealed intramural hematoma throughout the aorta, as well as systemic metastases of adrenocortical carcinoma with invasion into the aortic wall and formation of a pseudolumen accompanied by disruption of the vasa vasorum. As far as we know, this is the second case of aortic dissection associated with metastatic carcinoma. The highly aggressive nature of the tumor cells was demonstrated by high mitotic ratio and Ki-67 labeling index. The tumor was also positive for matrix metalloproteinase-12, thus suggesting disruption of the aortic media."

A review.,"With continued growth of the elderly population and improvements in cancer therapies, the number of patients with symptomatic spinal metastases is likely to increase, and this is a condition that commonly leads to debilitating neurological dysfunction and pain. Advancements in surgical techniques of resection and spinal reconstruction, improvements in clinical outcomes following various treatment modalities, generally increased overall survival in patients with metastatic spine disease, and a recent randomized trial by Patchell and colleagues demonstrating the superiority of a combined surgical/radiotherapeutic approach over a radiotherapy-only strategy have led many to suggest increasingly aggressive interventions for patients with such lesions. Optimal management of spinal metastases encompasses numerous medical specialties, including neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, medical and radiation oncology, radiology, and rehabilitation medicine. In this review, the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of spinal metastatic disease are discussed. Ultimately, the goal of treatment in patients with spinal metastases remains palliative, and clinical judgment is required to select the appropriate patients for surgical intervention."
CD008686,0,20594020,0,"Clinical presentation, histology, and treatment in 430 patients with primary tumors of the spinal cord, spinal meninges, or cauda equina.","OBJECT Patients having a primary tumor of the spinal cord, spinal meninges or cauda equina, are relatively rare. Neurosurgeons encounter and treat such patients, and need to be aware of their clinical presentation, tumor types, treatment options, and potential complications. The purpose of this paper is to report results from a series of 430 patients with primary intraspinal tumors, taken from a larger cohort of 9661 patients with primary tumors of the CNS. METHODS Extensive information on individuals diagnosed (in the year 2000) as having a primary CNS neoplasm was prospectively collected in a Patient Care Evaluation Study conducted by the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons. Data from US hospital cancer registries were submitted directly to the National Cancer Database. Intraspinal tumor cases were identified based on ICD-O-2 topography codes C70.1, C72.0, and C72.1. Analyses were performed using SPSS. RESULTS Patients with primary intraspinal tumors represented 4.5% of the CNS tumor group, and had a mean age of 49.3 years. Pain was the most common presenting symptom, while the most common tumor types were meningioma (24.4%), ependymoma (23.7%), and schwannoma (21.2%). Resection, surgical biopsy, or both were performed in 89.3% of cases. Complications were low, but included neurological worsening (2.2%) and infection (1.6%). Radiation therapy and chemotherapy were administered to 20.3% and 5.6% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Data from this study are suitable for benchmarking, describing prevailing patterns of care, and generating additional hypotheses for future studies."
CD008686,0,20594011,0,A systematic review of occipital cervical fusion: techniques and outcomes.,"OBJECT Numerous techniques have been historically used for occipitocervical fusion with varied results. The purpose of this study was to examine outcomes of various surgical techniques used in patients with various disease states to elucidate the most efficacious method of stabilization of the occipitocervical junction. METHODS A literature search of peer-reviewed articles was performed using PubMed and CINAHL/Ovid. The key words ""occipitocervical fusion,"" ""occipitocervical fixation,"" ""cervical instrumentation,"" and ""occipitocervical instrumentation"" were used to search for relevant articles. Thirty-four studies were identified that met the search criteria. Within these studies, 799 adult patients who underwent posterior occipitocervical fusion were analyzed for radiographic and clinical outcomes including fusion rate, time to fusion, neurological outcomes, and the rate of adverse events. RESULTS No articles stronger than Class IV were identified in the literature. Among the patients identified within the cited articles, the use of posterior screw/rod instrumentation constructs were associated with a lower rate of postoperative adverse events (33.33%) (p < 0.0001), lower rates of instrumentation failure (7.89%) (p < 0.0001), and improved neurological outcomes (81.58%) (p < 0.0001) when compared with posterior wiring/rod, screw/plate, and onlay in situ bone grafting techniques. The surgical technique associated with the highest fusion rate was posterior wiring and rods (95.9%) (p = 0.0484), which also demonstrated the shortest fusion time (p < 0.0064). Screw/rod techniques also had a high fusion rate, fusing in 93.02% of cases. When comparing outcomes of surgical techniques depending on the disease status, inflammatory diseases had the lowest rate of instrumentation failure (0%) and the highest rate of neurological improvement (90.91%) following the use of screw/rod techniques. Occipitocervical fusion performed for the treatment of tumors by using screw/rod techniques had the lowest fusion rate (57.14%) (p = 0.0089). Traumatic causes of occipitocervical instability had the highest percentage of pain improvement with the use of screw/plates (100% improvement) (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Based on the existing literature, techniques that use screw/rod constructs in occipitocervical fusion are associated with very favorable outcomes in all categories assessed for all disease processes. For patients requiring occipitocervical arthrodesis for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, screw/rod constructs are associated with the most favorable outcomes, while posterior wiring and onlay in situ bone grafting is associated with the least favorable outcomes. Occipitocervical arthrodesis performed for the diagnosis of tumor is associated with the lowest rate of successful arthrodesis using screw/rod techniques, while posterior wiring and rods have the highest rate of arthrodesis. The nonspecified disease group had the lowest rate of surgical adverse events and the highest rate of neurological improvement."

Sensations of pain and temperature had been disturbed in the right leg since 42 years old. MRI showed Gadolinium-enhanced lesion as a ring-like-enhancement of the spinal cord at C1-2 on T1-weighted image (T1WI), with high signal area and swelling of the spinal cord at the upper C1 to C6 areas on T2-weighted image. We diagnosed her as having DRM after considering the differential diagnosis, e.g., multiple sclerosis, spinal tumor and other neurological diseases. Her sensory symptoms quickly improved following therapy with prednisolone and warfarin. Although she remained healthy for a few years, dysesthesia of the neck on the right side appeared 5 years later after the first clinical occurrence. At this time, MRI demonstrated Gadolinium-enhanced lesion as a ring-like enhancement of the spinal cord at C2 on T1WI. but the area also differed from that of previous lesion; a high signal area and swelling of the spinal cord was also seen on FLAIR image of the medulla and upper C1 to C6. For recurrence of DRM, we administered prednisolone and warfarin. Thereafter, the patient recovered and the spinal cord lesion on MRI decreased markedly. The clinical course demonstrated that administration of prednisolone and warfarin might be effective for relapsed DRM."

CD008686,0,20577932,0,Neurologic manifestations of neoplastic and radiation-induced plexopathies.,"Metastatic plexopathy is often a disabling accompaniment of advanced systemic cancer, and may involve any of the peripheral nerve plexuses. Brachial plexopathy most commonly occurs in carcinoma of the breast and lung; lumbosacral plexopathy is most common with colorectal and gynecologic tumors, sarcomas, and lymphomas. Neoplastic plexopathy is often characterized initially by severe, unrelenting pain followed by development of weakness and focal sensory disturbances. In previously treated patients, the main differential diagnostic consideration is radiation-induced plexopathy, which can be difficult to distinguish from tumor plexopathy. Diagnosis is usually made following an analysis of the clinical, neuroimaging, and electrophysiologic features. Treatment of metastatic plexopathy has included surgical resection of tumor in selected cases, radiotherapy to the plexus, systemic chemotherapy, interventional pain management procedures, and symptomatic treatment. These measures often offer temporary (months) relief or improvement. Physicians treating these patients should focus on effective management of pain and prevention of complications of immobility produced by the neuromuscular dysfunction."
CD008686,0,20574672,0,Prognostic factors for skeletal complications from metastatic bone disease in breast cancer.,"Skeletal morbidity is common in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer (BC) and can undermine patients' functional independence and quality of life. Previously defined prognostic factors may not reflect current treatment standards and the use of antiresorptive therapies. We report a comprehensive multivariate analysis of potential prognostic factors for skeletal-related events (SREs) using data from a phase III, randomized study of zoledronic acid in patients with bone metastases from BC. The trial evaluated the number and timing of SREs (pathologic fracture, palliative radiotherapy to bone, surgery to bone to treat or prevent a fracture, and spinal cord compression) and assessed variables for prognostic significance in univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analyses. Continuous variables were categorized with predefined cutpoints. All associations with P < 0.05 were considered significant. A total of 444 zoledronic acid-treated patients with assessments of biochemical markers of bone metabolism and complete baseline variable data were included. Significant baseline prognostic factors for occurrence of a first SRE by multivariate analyses included age, pain score, prior history of an SRE, predominant lesion type, elevated bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Prior fracture was found to be prognostic in a reduced multivariate analysis of time to first fracture, but not for time to first palliative radiotherapy. In conclusion, this model identified several prognostic factors that may be useful in routine clinical care. Validation of these factors in a separate dataset and generation of a prognostic risk score are recommended next steps."
CD008686,0,20573033,0,An autopsied case of sporadic adult-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with FUS-positive basophilic inclusions.,"Basophilic inclusions (BIs), which are characterized by their staining properties of being weakly argyrophilic, reactive with Nissl staining, and immunohistochemically negative for tau and transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), have been identified in patients with juvenile-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and adult-onset atypical ALS with ophthalmoplegia, autonomic dysfunction, cerebellar ataxia, or a frontal lobe syndrome. Mutations in the fused in sarcoma gene (FUS) have been reported in cases of familial and sporadic ALS, and FUS immunoreactivity has been demonstrated in basophilic inclusion body disease (BIBD), neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID), and atypical frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive and tau-negative inclusions (aFTLD-U). In the present study, we immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally studied an autopsy case of sporadic adult-onset ALS with numerous BIs. The patient presented with the classical clinical course of ALS since 75 years of age and died at age 79. Postmortem examination revealed that both Betz cells in the motor cortex and motor neurons in the spinal cord were affected. The substantia nigra was spared. Notably, BIs were frequently observed in the motor neurons of the anterior horns, the inferior olivary nuclei, and the basal nuclei of Meynert. BIs were immunopositive for p62, LC3, and FUS, but immunonegative for tau, TDP-43, and neurofilament. Ultrastructurally, BIs consisted of filamentous or granular structures associated with degenerated organelles with no limiting membrane. There were no Bunina bodies, skein-like inclusions, or Lewy-like inclusions. All exons and exon/intron boundaries of the FUS gene were sequenced but no mutations were identified."

They are very rare and account for 0.3 to 1.5 % of all spinal schwannomas. It is not known for certain why this happens, and several theories have been put forward. They do not exhibit any characteristic clinical picture, being pain the most frequent symptom. Imaging is also not specific and the correct diagnosis is attained most of the times after pathological examination. The goal of treatment must be complete removal, which is curative. We are presenting two patients in whom an intramedullary tumor was removed. The true nature of the lesions was suspected during the operation, but only after pathological examination was confirmed. A review of the literature has been undertaken, with special attention to the theories about the origin of these uncommon tumors."

We retrospectively reviewed our prospective breast cancer database to determine the percentage of patients who underwent breast cancer operations with either local or paravertebral block regional anesthesia from January 1 through June 30, 2008. Fifty-two of 70 patients (74%) were able to undergo breast cancer surgery with local or paravertebral block regional anesthesia. Operations included mastectomy, full axillary dissections, and expander or implant reconstruction. There were no conversions to general anesthesia and no unplanned overnight admissions. Only 5 of 52 patients (10%) undergoing surgery with local or paravertebral block regional anesthesia developed postoperative nausea or vomiting. We conclude that most elective outpatient breast cancer surgery operations can be performed with the patients given local or regional anesthesia."

No consensus exists regarding the type of stem cell, if any, that will prove to be effective therapeutically. Most data suggest that no single therapy will be sufficient to overcome all the biological complications caused by SCI. Rationales for therapeutic use of stem cells for SCI include replacement of damaged neurons and glial cells, secretion of trophic factors, regulation of gliosis and scar formation, prevention of cyst formation, and enhancement of axon elongation. Most therapeutic approaches that use stem cells involve implantation of these cells into the spinal cord. The attendant risks of stem cell therapy for SCI--including tumor formation, or abnormal circuit formation leading to dysfunction--must be weighed against the potential benefits of this approach. This Review will examine the biological effects of SCI, the opportunities for stem cell treatment, and the types of stem cells that might be used therapeutically. The limited information available on the possible benefits of stem cell therapy to humans will also be discussed."

Magnetic resonance imaging showed evidence of myositis corresponding to the 'radiation-recall phenomenon', an inflammatory reaction of irradiated tissue."
CD008686,0,20522095,0,20 year old lady with a paraspinal mass.,A 20 year old female presented with a 4 month history of right upper limb pain and paraesthesias. She had no systemic symptoms and no prior medical or family history of note. MRI revealed a right-sided intradural extramedullary mass extending from C7-T1 and displacing the spinal cord. While awaiting surgery her symptoms progressed to involve the right lower limb. She was re-imaged and the lesion now extended from C5 to T3 with spinal cord compression at C7-T1. The radiological features and recent rapid growth were felt to be in keeping with a large plexiform neurofibroma. The patient underwent emergency resection of the lesion and pathology revealed Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL)-mixed cellularity type. A mediastinal mass was identified on further imaging and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of HL-stage IV. The patient is currently undergoing treatment with ABVD chemotherapy. CNS-HL is extremely rare and may occur de novo or in association with systemic disease. Lesions may be parenchymal or dural based and are usually intracranial with an increased risk of CNS involvement in HL-mixed-cellularity type as in our patient. This is the first report in the literature of CNS-HL radiologically mimicking a paraspinal plexiform neurofibroma.
CD008686,0,20518613,0,Perispinal etanercept: a new therapeutic paradigm in neurology.,"Etanercept is a potent antagonist of TNF, a pleotropic immune signaling molecule that is also a pivotal regulator of synaptic function. Excess TNF is centrally involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of inflammatory neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, sciatica, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. Perispinal etanercept produces rapid improvement in both Alzheimer's disease and sciatica and in other forms of disc-related pain. Basic research and the observed clinical effects suggest that etanercept has the surprising ability to penetrate into the cerebrospinal fluid after perispinal administration. Perispinal administration is a novel method of delivery designed to introduce this anti-TNF molecule into the bidirectional cerebrospinal venous system and the cerebrospinal fluid to facilitate its selective delivery to either spinal structures or the brain. The scientific rationale, physiologic mechanisms, clinical effects and potential clinical indications of this therapeutic approach are the subject of this article."
CD008686,0,20512551,0,Atypical appearance of a neural foraminal elastofibroma of the lumbar spine mimicking a schwannoma on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.,Elastofibromas are rare benign lesions that are most commonly found in the periscapular region. We describe a rare case of a 40-year-old woman presenting with right buttock radiating pain. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a homogeneously enhanced mass occupying the right neural foramen at the L4/5 level. The clinical and radiological presentation suggested a schwannoma. Pathology examination of the tissue indicated elastofibroma.
CD008686,0,20511182,0,Adult ependymal tumors: prognosis and the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center experience.,"Ependymomas in adults are rare and often misdiagnosed. This study reports on a series of adult patients with confirmed ependymoma treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Patients aged >17 and with ependymoma were identified, and clinical data were collected by retrospective chart review. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the clinical data, Kaplan-Meier methods were used to generate survival curves, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association of clinical characteristics with survival. This series included 123 adult patients [51% male; median age 39 years (18-72)]. Forty had tumors in the brain, 80 in the spine, and 3 had both. The majority were Grade I/II lesions (108) vs Grade III (anaplastic; 15). Eighteen patients had tumors that were reclassified as ependymal tumors at MDACC. The most common presenting symptom was pain, with an average of 4 symptoms reported prior to diagnosis. Sixty-three percent of patients had a gross total resection, and 49% received radiation therapy. Average follow-up was 5.5 years, and 13% had died. Median time to recurrence was 21 months (Grade II) brain and 18 months (Grade III). Worse outcome measured by overall and progression-free survival were associated with brain location (P = .01, P = .04) and tumor anaplasia (P = .0025, P = .001). An MIB-1 > 10 was associated with worse outcome (P = .03). Tumor grade and brain location are associated with a worse prognosis. Reclassification of ependymoma by neuropathologists is common. Results of this study have lead to a multicenter study to further define important diagnostic and prognostic variables for adults with ependymoma."
CD008686,0,21848066,0,Somatosensory evoked potential for detection of subclinical neuropathy in Egyptian children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.,"To evaluate neurological changes developing during paediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) therapy clinically and through electrophysiological Study of Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs) changes in different phases of therapy. Thirty five-ALL patients with age range from 3-14 years were included compared to 30 healthy controls. History, neurological examination, complete blood counts, cytological examination of bone marrow aspirate and cerebrospinal fluid with Measurement of Serum Methotrexate (MTX) were done. The SSEPs were performed and patients subjected to another SSEP with measurement of serum MTX level before and 10 days after intra-thecal injection (IMTX). Clinical neurological findings in patients after induction were depressed deep tendon reflexes (43.3%), hypotonia (28.6%), lost pain sensation (28.6%), muscle weakness (17.1%) and movement disorders (17.1%). Percentage of delayed SSEPs after induction were at levels of brachial plexus (28.6%), spinal cord (68.6%), cortical conduction (31.4%), ERB-N13 Inter Peak Latency (IPL) (74.3%) and N13-N20 IPL (17.1%) in the studied patients. Significant prolonged latency of N13 (p = 0.005), N20 (p = 0.04) and IPL of ERB-N 13 (p = 0.005), N13-N20 (p = 0.01), Inter-Side Difference (ISD) of N13 (p = 0.01), ERB-N13 (p = 0.02) and N13-N20 (p = 0.03) after induction compared to values at diagnosis. Significant positive correlation were found between serum MTX after IMTX with N13-N20 IPL (p = 0.01), N20 ISD (p = 0.03) with significant prolongation in N20 latency, N13-N20 IPL and ISD of N20 compared to values before injection. ALL patients have prolonged latency of SSEPs at cervical cord and cortical levels which increased after IMTX due to axonal injury throughout the cord. SSEPs could be an early diagnostic tool for subclinical neuropathy."
CD008686,0,20508971,0,Radiosurgery using the Cyberknife for benign spinal tumors: Korea Cancer Center Hospital experience.,"This study evaluated clinical outcome and safety of radiosurgery using the Cyberknife for treatment of benign spinal tumors. The authors treated 30 benign spinal tumors in 20 patients with the Cyberknife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) from 2002 to 2008. Among these there were 20 neurogenic tumors, eight hemangioblastomas, and two meningiomas. Four patients with neurofibromatosis (NF) type 2 and four patients with Von Hippel Lindau disease were also included. Radiosurgery was done as primary treatment for 22 lesions, for postoperative residual tumor control for four lesions, and for the remaining four lesions with image-based progression after initial subtotal resection. The distribution of lesions was cervical (18 tumors), thoracic (six), and cauda equina level (six). Follow-up data included imaging studies, clinical findings, and radiotherapy data. Tumor volume ranged from 0.04 to 33.65 cm³ (mean, 4.52 cm³). A 14-33 Gy marginal dose was delivered in 1-5 fractions. The mean follow-up period was 35.6 months (range, 12-84 months). On follow-up, most lesions decreased in size (57%) or remained unchanged (33%). Two lesions initially decreased, then increased later. One lesion increased without response. With regard to clinical aspects, radicular pain and myelopathic pain improved after radiosurgery in most cases (94%). Motor weakness recovered in two out of five patients and recovery of sensory change occurred in four out of ten patients. In two patients, symptoms were aggravated by tumor enlargement and the occurrence of new lesion. Mean spinal cord volumes receiving more than 10 and 8 Gy were 0.40 ± 0.4 and 0.81 ± 0.7 cm³, respectively. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using the Cyberknife showed the ability to control benign spinal tumors without complication in most cases."
CD008686,0,20508352,0,Diagnosis and surgical management of intraspinal hemorrhagic juxtafacet cysts in lumbar spine: experience of eight cases.,"Hemorrhagic juxtafacet synovial cysts have rarely been reported in the literature. We reviewed case records of eight patients with hemorrhagic juxtafacet cysts treated surgically. Back pain and acute radicular pain were the presenting features in the all patients. The possible cause for hemorrhage could be identified in only three patients. Six patients had medial facetectomy and hemilaminectom and two patients with stenosis had medial facetectomy and laminectomy. Following surgery there was immediate relief from pain with significant improvement of the Oswestry disability index (ODI). Six patients had an excellent outcome while the remaining two patients had a good outcome. During the follow-up there was no progression of slippage, no segment instability, and no recurrence. Hemilaminectomy or laminectomy with medial facetectomy without fusion might serve as an effective and safe management strategy to treat lumbar hemorrhagic juxtrafacet synovial cysts."

CD008686,0,20506942,0,Chronic spinal cord injury in the cervical spine of a young soccer player.,"A 17-year-old male soccer player presented with numbness in the upper- and lower-left extremities of 6 months' duration. He had no apparent history of trauma but experienced neck pain during heading of the ball 5 years prior. A high-signal intensity area was seen on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine. No muscle weakness was observed. Hypoesthesia was observed in bilateral forearms, hands, and extremities below the inguinal region. Plain radiographs in the neutral position showed local kyphosis at C3/4. A small protrusion of the C3/4 disk was observed on T1-weighted MRI. A high-signal area in the spinal cord at the C3/4 level was observed on T2-weighted MRI, but this was not enhanced by gadolinium. Multiple sclerosis, intramedullary spinal cord tumor, sarcoidosis and malignant lymphoma, and spinal cord injury were all considered in the differential diagnosis. However, in view of the clinical, laboratory, and radiological investigations, we concluded that repeated impacts to the neck caused by heading of the ball during soccer induced a chronic, minor spinal cord injury. This contributed to the high-signal intensity change of the spinal cord in T2-weighted MRI. The present case demonstrates that repeated impact may cause chronic spinal cord injury. Soccer, American football, or rugby players presenting with neck or extremity symptoms should not be overlooked for the possibility of latent spinal cord injury, as this could present later development of more severe or unrecoverable spinal cord injuries."

CD008686,0,20499113,0,Percutaneous anterolateral balloon kyphoplasty for metastatic lytic lesions of the cervical spine.,"The purpose of our report is to describe a new application of kyphoplasty, the percutaneous anterolateral balloon kyphoplasty that we performed in two cases of metastatic osteolytic lesions in cervical spine. The first patient, aged 48 years, with primary malignancy in lungs had two metastatic lesions in C2 and C6 vertebrae. Patient's complaints were about pain and restriction of movements (due to the pain) in the cervical spine. The second patient, aged 70 years, with primary malignancy in stomach, had multiple metastatic lesions in thoracolumbar spine and C3, C4 and C5 vertebrae without neurological symptoms. The main symptoms were from cervical spine with severe pain even in bed rest and systematic use of opiate-base analgesic. The preoperative status was evaluated with X-rays, CT scan, MRI scan and with Karnofsky score and visual analogue pain (VAS) scale. Both patients underwent percutaneous anterolateral balloon kyphoplasty via the anterolateral approach in cervical spine under general anaesthesia. No clinical complications occurred during or after the procedure. Both patients experienced pain relief immediately after balloon kyphoplasty and during the following days. The stiffness also resolved rapidly and cervical collars were removed. VAS score significantly improved from 85 and 95 preoperatively to 30 in both patients. Karnofsky score showed also improvement from 40 and 30 preoperatively to 80 and 70, respectively, at the final follow-up (7 months after the procedure). Fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous anterolateral balloon kyphoplasty proved to be safe and effective minimally invasive procedure for metastatic osteolytic lesions of the cervical spine, reducing pain and avoiding vertebral collapse. Experience and attention are necessary in order to avoid complications."

A 60-year-old man presented with a history of back pain for several months. The patient subsequently developed gait disturbance and numbness on bilateral lower limbs. Preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a neoplastic lesion occupying the posterior column of the ninth thoracic vertebra. The most likely preoperative diagnosis was osteoblastoma. The patient underwent tumor excision and posterior fusion with instrumentation. No nerve involvement of the tumor was identified intraoperatively. Histological diagnosis was schwannoma. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report of intraosseous schwannoma originating from the posterior column of the mobile spine."

All patients with upper abdominal visceral pain should be considered for celiac plexus neurolysis soon after diagnosis. Intrathecal therapy should be considered in any patient with moderate-to-severe pain despite a reasonable therapeutic trial of opioid pharmacotherapy or in any patient intolerant of opioid therapy. Specific interventions for vertebral metastases and other sites of metastatic bone pain, including vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, and image-guided tumor ablation, should be understood and considered. A collaborative model of care, including pain medicine specialists with expertise in interventional therapies, should be standard in all oncologic practices in order to optimize outcomes for patients with cancer throughout the course of their treatment."
CD008686,0,20455409,0,[A case of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Cupriavidus pauculus].,"Cupriavidus pauculus (formerly CDC Group IVc-2) is a non-fermentative, motile, gram-negative bacillus, rarely associated with human infections. It has been isolated from water, water from ultrafiltration systems and bottled mineral water. To date, 19 cases of bacteremia, two cases of peritonitis and one case of tenosynovitis associated with C. pauculus have been reported in English literature. In this paper, we report the first case of C. pauculus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in Turkey. A 47 years-old female with breast cancer was performed total mastectomy six years ago and received six cures of chemotherapy after surgery. The patient was hospitalized in medical oncology clinic with complaints of weight loss, nausea and vomiting for one year. Since she had problems of consiousness, dysphagia and pitosis, lumbar puncture was performed to rule out central nervous system infection or metastasis. Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed upon the examination of Indian-ink stained smear of cerebrospinal fluid and amphotericin B was initiated. On the 11th day of her follow up, she developed respiratory distress and was transferred to pulmonary intensive care and underwent invasive mechanical ventilator (IMV) therapy. On the 4th day of IMV; a new infiltration was detected on the upper zone of chest X-ray in addition to fever (38.3 degrees C) and intense endotracheal secretion. Therefore, bronchoscopic examination was performed and bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchoscope aspiration materials were obtained and cultivated. Bacteria grown at blood agar and EMB agar after 48 hours of incubation were stained as gram-negative bacilli and identified as C. pauculus by VITEK 2 compact system (bioMérieux Inc, USA). The strain was susceptible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacilin/tazobactam and resistant to amikacin. The case was considered as C. pauculus VAP and imipenem (500 mg, 4 x 1) for 14 days was initiated. Clinical and microbiological resolution was achieved by imipenem therapy. In conclusion, rare pathogens like C. pauculus should be considered among the possible causative agents in infections that develop in immunocompromised host."

Her chief complaint was a gradually increasing swelling in the left side of her maxilla, during the preceding 2 months. After clinical examination, the radiologic and computerized tomographic scan examinations revealed the presence of a radiopaque foreign material in contact with the apex of tooth #22, confined within the limits of a radiolucent area. On dental anamnesis and after communication with her dentist, it was concluded that calcium hydroxide was deliberately extruded for the healing of the large lesion. The patient was scheduled for periapical surgery. The histopathologic features of the lesion revealed the presence of a periapical cyst and the absence of foreign body giant cells. After an observation period of 1 year, healing was uneventful."

CD008686,0,20443133,0,Characterization of a new renal cell carcinoma bone metastasis mouse model.,"Metastatic bone disease caused by renal cell carcinoma (RCC) occurs frequently and becomes more and more prevalent presumably because survival times among patients with disseminated cancers are increasing. Patients with bone metastases from renal cell carcinoma suffer from severe pain, nerve compression syndromes and pathologic fractures. Very little is known about the mechanisms of skeletal metastases of RCC. Thus, to better understand the molecular mechanism of renal cell cancer (RCC) bone metastasis, it is crucial to develop new animal models. We have established a new animal model of RCC metastasis to bone by inoculation of human 786-O/luciferase cells into the left cardiac ventricle of athymic nude mice. The animals developed aggressive osteolytic bone destruction as monitored by radiography and micro-CT-scans with the mean endpoint at 62 +/- 8 days. The extensive bone destruction observed was comparable to the clinical setting and mainly occurred in hind limbs, forelimbs and the spine. The tumors were primarily located within the bone and resulted in destruction of cortical bone. No soft tissue metastases were detected by BLI or histomorphometry. To increase the bone-metastatic potential of the 786-O cell line, an in vivo selection was done yielding a subpopulation causing osteolytic lesions with the mean endpoint of 47 +/- 3 days. The selected subline secreted more proangiogenic factors VEGF and bFGF in vitro compared to the parental cell line suggesting that these tumors are highly vascular. This model provides a reliable reproduction of the clinical situation and therefore, is suitable for designing and evaluating more effective treatments for RCC bone metastasis."

CD008686,0,20424916,0,Unusual clinical presentation of brown tumor in hemodialysis patients: two case reports.,"Brown tumor or osteoclastoma is a lytic bone tumor, which is common in secondary hyperparathyroidism (1.5-13%) in chronic dialysis patients, mainly in those with untreated renal osteodystrophy. Brown tumor appears as a result from excess osteoclast activity and consists of collections of osteoclasts intermixed with fibrous tissue and poorly mineralized woven bone. It can be manifested as a single or multiple bone lesions. Although invasive, it has no malignant potential and should be distinguished from giant cell tumors of the bone. Two unusual cases of brown tumor in dialysis patients are reported. We present a first patient with five subtotal parathyroidectomies between 2002 and 2009 and a tendency toward recurrence of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPTH). The double MRI check up could not reveal any ectopic parathyroid gland. Although the patient had permanently high PTH values, serum calcium level was never above the normal range. However, the brown tumor in the cervical spine was destructing the cervical vertebrae and required surgical intervention. Despite the conservative treatment with calcium and non-calcium-based binders and various forms of vitamin D, the patient's clinical and biochemical condition improved only after the use of cinacalcet. The second patient, a 58-years-old female on chronic hemodialysis since 1998, was found with high PTH serum levels in 2009. The development of sHPTH was scintigraphically confirmed and surgically treated. During the late 2008, she started feeling pain, numbness and swelling of the 3rd right hand finger, prior to the full clinical manifestation of the tumor. The CT scan of the right hand showed osteolytic changes and soft tissue destruction of the middle phalanx of the 3rd right hand finger. This formation corresponded to an unusual presentation of brown tumor associated with sHPTH. As expected, after the parathyroidectomy, there was no marked change in the destructed bone of the 3rd right hand finger middle phalanx, but only a gradual improvement in the subjective clinical condition of the patient. Based on these two reports, we would recommend that in cases of severe or recurrent sHPTH either total parathyroidectomy or early administration of calcimimetics should be considered. Furthermore, the implementation of regular checkup and treatment according to the KDIGO guidelines should be advised and clinical appearance of any bone tumor immediately checked for an association with sHPTH, which is a rather common entity in dialysis patients."

The case of a 14-year-old female with a history of having a fall from a height of 50 cm with a direct trauma in the left lumbar region 3 years ago is presented. She was asymptomatic until one month before going to consultation when she had a minor trauma (a fall from her own height) and a volume increase was detected in the upper left abdominal quadrant. Physical examination revealed splenomegaly 8 cm below the ridge rib and pain was induced after deep palpation. omputed tomography showed a 12 x 10 x 8 cm cystic lesion in the upper splenic pole. Laparotomy and splenectomy was performed. The histological analysis showed that the cyst wall consisted of dense collagen without epithelial lining. Currently the patient is asymptomatic."

CD008686,0,20420495,0,Recent development in therapeutics for breakthrough pain.,"Breakthrough pain is defined as transitory flares of pain. Breakthrough pain is caused by cancer, cancer complications, treatment or comorbidities. The usual onset to maximum breakthrough pain intensity time is 3 min and duration is 30 min; therefore, the assessment for response needs to be at short intervals. The rapid onset and offset of pain results in inadequate responses when oral opioids are used to manage pain flares. Several strategies have been used to manage breakthrough pain: titration of the chronic opioid, independent titration of rescue opioids and alternative routes. Buccal fentanyl has a rapid onset to analgesia and appears to be superior to oral morphine. Newer fentanyl preparations have been released to manage breakthrough pain in the opioid-tolerant individual. Other routes of administration that have a rapid onset to analgesia include intranasal hydrophilic and lipophilic opioids, inhaled opioids delivered by special delivery devices and parenteral morphine. In a small series of patients experiencing severe flares of pain with spinal opioids unrelieved by parenteral opioids, sublingual ketamine and bolus doses of intrathecal local anesthetics have been effective. Nonpharmacological approaches to managing activity-related pain include radiation therapy, surgical correction of impending fractures, kyphoplasty and radioisotopes."

CD008686,0,20398443,0,GnRH antagonists in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.,"Analogues of the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This has provided treatment modalities for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. The latest group of analogues, the GnRH antagonists, make promising treatments available that avoid the transient surge in testosterone that occurs with the use of GnRH agonists. Such surges may stimulate tumor growth, causing patients to experience new or worsening cancer symptoms and potential serious adverse effects, including increased bone pain, urinary retention, and spinal cord compression and consequently delay the therapeutic benefits of agonist therapy. Degarelix, an antagonist, recently approved in the United States and Europe, achieves faster, more profound and sustained testosterone suppression and with fewer adverse effects when compared with agonists and other antagonists. This review discusses and compares the compounds degarelix, abarelix, and cetrorelix."

A randomized clinical trial was used in 40 children (aged 7-12 years) with leukemia, followed by interviews in 20 of these participants. The participants were randomly assigned to a music group (n = 20) or control group (n = 20). The primary outcome was pain scores and the secondary was heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation measured before, during, and after the procedure. Anxiety scores were measured before and after the procedure. Interviews with open-ended questions were conducted in conjunction with the completed procedures. The results showed lower pain scores and heart and respiratory rates in the music group during and after the lumbar puncture. The anxiety scores were lower in the music group both before and after the procedure. The findings from the interviews confirmed the quantity results through descriptions of a positive experience by the children, including less pain and fear."

Paraplegia is the most serious complication of the disease and is caused by compression of the spinal cord by the cysts. We report a 30-year-old woman with an isolated primary hydatid cyst that responded to treatment with albendazole. She presented with back and right leg pain. MRI of the lumbar spine showed a solitary cyst measuring 2.2 x 2.7 cm, with an intraspinal extension at L4-L5. Physical examination did not reveal any focal deficit and the patient was treated with albendazole drug therapy (400mg daily). After 7 months' treatment, she had improved both clinically and radiologically. Albendazole drug therapy appears to be effective for conservative treatment of patients with primary solitary hydatid disease in the lumbar spine."

Only few reports in the literature describe these pathologies. In this article, the authors report five cases (3 males and 2 females) of lumbar discal cysts treated surgically by microdiscectomy. These patients were admitted with a history of back pain and/or sciatalgia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine of all patients revealed lumbar discal cysts, causing compression to the spinal dura and roots. All patients were treated by partial hemilaminectomy and microscopic cyst resection. Postoperatively, the complaints showed improvement, and the patients were discharged with no complications. The cases of lumbar discal cysts are described in the literature as individual case reports, therefore; the authors performed a wide systemic review of all these cases published in PubMed and MedLine, including the patients in the present report.

However, even in the presence of metastases, patients with Hürthle cell carcinoma have a relatively good prognosis. There are few reports of Hürthle cell carcinoma metastases to the vertebral column, and none describing aggressive resection of spinal metastases. Here, we report a 68-year-old woman with a solitary metastasis of Hürthle cell carcinoma to the T1 vertebral body causing severe kyphotic deformity, myelopathy, and pain. The patient was treated with aggressive excisional decompression of the spinal cord and T1 vertebral body resection from an entirely posterior approach. Reconstruction and stabilization of the anterior spine was accomplished with a transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion allograft spacer and posterior instrumentation.

CD008686,0,20306047,0,Osteoanabolic therapy: a non-surgical option of treatment for Kümmell's disease?,"Kümmell's disease is the current eponym of avascular osteonecrosis (AVN) of a vertebral body leading to a delayed non-healing vertebral compression fracture (VCF) and thus pseudo-arthrosis. AVN is characterized by production of gas that outlines a radiolucent zone in the vertebral body, called vacuum cleft sign (VCS) or ""Kümmell's sign"". This sign has been observed in up to one-third of VCFs and is often associated with osteoporosis and never with malignant or inflammatory diseases. Generally, treatment strategies are conservative management and percutaneous vertebroplasty. Teriparatide (rhPTH [1-34]) is an osteoanabolic agent approved for treatment of osteoporosis and helpful in fracture's healing too. Here, we describe the case of an 81-year-old osteoporotic woman presented with a 1-year history of persistent low back pain onset after a trauma. A lumbar spine Computer Tomography (CT) scan performed 2 months after the injury (November 2006) showed the VCS within a VCF of the first lumbar vertebra; a control CT scan 1 year later showed persistence of the finding. After 12 months of treatment with teriparatide 20 mcg/day, symptoms disappeared and vacuum was significantly reduced. In conclusion, Kümmell's disease may be hypothesized in patients with chronic spinal symptoms, especially in the presence of osteoporosis. Moreover in this condition, osteoanabolic treatment may be used in patients with Kümmell's disease to enhance vertebral fracture's healing and contribute to back pain relief."

Pain is with dyspnea and emesis in the first time in a rate of about 50%, in the terminal stage up to 90% the most tormenting symptom. For more than 90% of patients the 3-step-WHO-regimen for cancer pain is able to relieve pain successfully. But a little group of cancer patients need invasive measures and methods to relieve pain sufficiently. This would be the 4th step, according to the enlarged WHO-regimen. Intravenous or intrathecal applications, eventually regional blockades should be considered. The following case-report shows the steps of a difficult cancer pain therapy in a regional general hospital. It is sometimes not evidence based, on the one hand because of necessary organizational, staff-related, or other makeshifts in daily clinical practice, on the other hand because of the lack of appropriate EBM-guidelines.

CD008686,0,20227645,0,Sciatica.,"Sciatica is a symptom rather than a specific diagnosis. Available evidence from basic science and clinical research indicates that both inflammation and compression are important in order for the nerve root to be symptomatic. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a key mediator in animal models, but its exact contribution in human radiculopathy is still a matter of debate. Sciatica is mainly diagnosed by history taking and physical examination. In general, the clinical course of acute sciatica is considered to be favourable. In the first 6-8 weeks, there is consensus that treatment of sciatica should be conservative. We review and comment on the levels of evidence of the efficacy of patient information, advice to stay active, physical therapy analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), epidural corticosteroid injections and transforaminal peri-radicular injections of corticosteroid. There is good evidence that discectomy is effective in the short term. but, in the long term, it is not more effective than prolonged conservative care. Shared decision making with regard to surgery is necessary in the absence of severe progressive neurological symptoms. Although the term sciatica is simple and easy to use, it is, in fact, an archaic and confusing term. For most researchers and clinicians, it refers to a radiculopathy, involving one of the lower extremities, and related to disc herniation (DH). As such, the term 'sciatica' is too restrictive as nerve roots from L1 to L4 may also be involved in the same process. However, even more confusing is the fact that patients, and many clinicians alike, use sciatica to describe any pain arising from the lower back and radiating down to the leg. The majority of the time, this painful sensation is referred pain from the lower back and is neither related to DH nor does it result from nerve-root compression. Although differentiating the radicular pain from the referred pain may be challenging for the clinician, it is of primary importance. This is because the epidemiology, clinical course and, most importantly, therapeutic interventions are different for these two conditions. It should, however, be emphasised that the quality of the available evidence is rather limited due to a considerable heterogeneity in the study populations included in the trials. This makes generalisation of findings across studies, and to routine clinical practice, a challenge. Prevalence estimates of radicular pain related to DH also vary considerably between studies, which is, in part, due to differences in the definitions used. A recent review showed that the prevalence of sciatic symptoms is rather variable, with values ranging from 1.6% to 43%. If stricter definitions of sciatica were used, for example, in terms of pain distribution and/or pain duration, lower prevalence rates were reported. Studies in working populations with physically demanding jobs consistently report higher rates of sciatica compared with studies in the general population."

A 33-year-old woman was admitted to the pulmonary department with headache, dyspnea and hemoptysis. There was a history of cesarean section due to intrauterine fetal death at 37-weeks gestation and this occurred 2 weeks before admission to the pulmonary department. The radiological studies revealed a nodular lung mass with hypervascularity in the left upper lobe and also a brain parenchymal lesion in the parietal lobe with marginal bleeding and surrounding edema. She underwent embolization for the lung lesion, which was suspected to be an arteriovenous malformation according to the pulmonary arteriogram. Approximately 10 days after discharge from the pulmonary department, she was readmitted due to back pain and progressive paraparesis. The neuroradiological studies revealed a hypervascular tumor occupying the entire L3 vertebral body and pedicle, and the tumor extended to the epidural area. She underwent embolization of the hypervascular lesion of the lumbar spine, and after which injection of polymethylmethacrylate in the L3 vertebral body, total laminectomy of L3, subtotal removal of the epidural mass and screw fixation of L2 and L4 were performed. The result of biopsy was a choriocarcinoma."

In the past decade, minimally invasive bone augmentation techniques for VF, such as percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) have become more widespread. According to the literature, both techniques provide significant pain relief. However, KP is more expensive and technically more demanding than VP. The current study surveyed German surgeons who practice percutaneous augmentation to evaluate and compare decisions regarding the implementation of these techniques.

We report a case of a lumbo-sacral epidural cavernous vascular malformation presenting with acute onset of right-sided S1 radiculopathy. Clinical aspects, imaging, intraoperative findings, and histology are demonstrated. The patient, a 27-year-old man presented with acute onset of pain, paraesthesia, and numbness within the right leg corresponding to the S1 segment. An acute lumbosacral disc herniation was suspected, but MRI revealed a cystic lesion with the shape of a balloon, a fluid level and a thickened contrast-enhancing wall. Intraoperatively, a purple-blue tumor with fibrous adhesions was located between the right S1 and S2 nerve roots. Macroscopically, no signs of epidural bleedings could be denoted. After coagulation of a reticular venous feeder network and dissection of the adhesions the rubber ball-like lesion was resected in total. Histology revealed a prominent venous vessel with a pathologically thickened, amuscular wall surrounded by smaller, hyalinized, venous vessels arranged in a back-to-back position typical for the diagnosis of a cavernous angioma. Lumina were partially occluded by thrombi. The surrounding fibrotic tissue showed signs of recurrent bleedings. There was no obvious mass hemorrhage into the surrounding tissue. In this unique case, the pathologic mechanism was not the usual rupture of the cavernous angioma with subsequent intraspinal hemorrhage, but acute mass effect by intralesional bleedings and thrombosis with subsequent increase of volume leading to nerve root compression. Thus, even without a sudden intraspinal hemorrhage a spinal cavernous malformation can cause acute symptoms identical to the clinical features of a soft disc herniation."
CD008686,0,20212227,0,Myelopathies in patients with cancer.,"Myelopathy is a devastating neurologic complication of cancer. The resulting pain, paralysis, and incontinence can turn a patient with cancer from a functioning individual to one who is confined to a chair or bed. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy can prevent or ameliorate these symptoms and improve both duration of survival and quality of life. Accurate neurologic assessment of patients is crucial for early diagnosis and correct therapy. Myelopathy in patients with cancer is not rare. Epidural spinal cord compression (SCC) affects an estimated 5% of patients with cancer; other disorders such as intramedullary spinal cord metastases, adverse effects of therapy, and paraneoplastic spinal cord syndromes, although less common, are equally devastating. Because of space limitations, this review addresses the pathophysiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and treatment of only some of the myelopathies that affect patients with cancer (Table 1).

This paper documents the detailed clinical, histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features of a case occurring in the pubic bone of a 57-year-old diabetic woman presenting with a history of pain and compromised mobility involving her hip. Radiology revealed a destructive lesion in the right pubic bone. The lesion was resected, and 7 months postoperatively it recurred. The patient died following metastases to multiple bony sites and liver, some 4 years after the onset of symptoms. Histologically, the tumor was consistent with SEF, although it showed some anomalous immunostaining, which, however, is typical of the tumor (for example, for S-100 protein and epithelial membrane antigen). By electron microscopy, some rough endoplasmic reticulum was present, but also tonofibrils and desmosomes.

CD008686,0,20142811,0,Sciatica: what the rheumatologist needs to know.,"Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a specific diagnosis, and is caused by a herniated lumbar disc in the vast majority of cases. The most important symptom is lower limb pain radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The clinical course of acute sciatica is generally favorable, with most pain and related disability improving within 2-4 weeks with or without treatment. Diagnosis mainly involves history taking and physical examination. Imaging is warranted if there is evidence of an underlying pathology other than disc herniation, such as infection or malignancy, and in patients with severe symptoms that do not improve after 6-8 weeks of conservative treatment. MRI is the preferred imaging modality, as it can visualize soft tissues better than CT and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. Conservative treatment is generally the first-line option in patients with sciatica; however, the currently available evidence does not show any intervention--including a broad range of conservative and surgical approaches--to have clearly superior outcomes. Thus, patient preference seems to be an important factor in the clinical management of sciatica."

Magnetic resonance imaging shows nodular contrast enhancement lining the CSF spaces. Positive CSF cytology requires optimal sampling and processing, and the treatment of neoplastic meningitis must be individualized. The CSF dissemination can be treated with intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate or Ara-C.

Systemic chemotherapy is needed to control solid manifestations or, in the case of substances entering the CSF, to support intrathecal chemotherapy."
CD008686,0,20140475,0,A case of Serratia granuloma in the soft tissue around the left kidney: a role of PTHrP in the formation of Serratia granuloma.,"Serratia marcescens is an ubiquitous, saprophytic gram-negative bacillus that is associated with infections such as bacteremia, pneumonia and osteomyelitis. However, it has not been known to form granulomas. A 72-year-old man with a history of tricuspidal insufficiency, mitral insufficiency and ureterolithiasis presented with lumbago on the left side. He was admitted to our hospital, where abscess formation in the subcapsular space and perirenal fat space of the left kidney, and left renal calculi were identified by computed tomography of the abdomen. As infection and/or a tumor were suspected, nephrectomy was performed. The histopathological findings in the resected kidney indicated severe infiltration by inflammatory cells with lymphoid follicles in the interstitium, and the proliferation of mesangial cells and matrix in glomerulus. Furthermore, giant cell granulomas were observed in the soft tissue around the kidney. As an aerobic culture of the abscess from the granulomas only produced Serratia marcescens, these granulomas were diagnosed as Serratia marcescens granulomas. In addition, expressions of PTHrP and PTH/PTHrP-receptor were observed in the giant cells in Serratia granuloma, which suggested that PTHrP might be involved in giant cell formation in Serratia granuloma by autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms."
CD008686,0,20134224,0,[Modified posterior unilateral laminectomy for a complex dumbbell schwannoma of the thoracolumbar junction].,"We report on an uncommon type of complex dumbbell schwannoma involving the thoracolumbar region, which was successfully managed with unilateral hemilaminectomy using a modified posterior approach. A 19-year-old male patient presented with one-year history of low back pain radiating to the lower limbs, limping of two month-history, and hesitancy of micturition of 15-day duration. Clinically, a diagnosis of conus-cauda lesion was suspected. Findings of the X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging of the dorsolumbar spine were suggestive of a complex dumbbell schwannoma, extending from the lower part of the T11 level to the upper part of the L1 vertebrae left to the spinal cord, with extension through the intervertebral foramina to the paraspinal region on the left side. A modified posterior approach with unilateral laminectomy was used for complete removal of the tumor. The histological diagnosis was schwannoma. The patient had minimal pain postoperatively, he was mobilized on the third day without the need for any external support. At one year follow-up, he had normal motor and sensory functions in the lower limbs."
CD008686,0,20131657,0,"Sacral meningocele in a military pilot, presenting during flight.","This study describes an unusual case of a military pilot with sacral meningocele that contained cerebrospinal fluid and presented as episodes of gluteal neuralgia during flight. The patient, a 38-yr-old male pilot, had complained of a dull and mild low lumbar pain over the previous 10 mo. These pains were exacerbated and radiated to the left gluteal region during flight. The patient's history, clinical examination, imaging findings, and treatment are reported. CT and MRI imaging revealed an unusual case of sacral meningocele (2.2 cm x 3.6 cm X 5.8 cm). These lesions can progress steadily in size, leading to worsening symptoms and potentially requiring surgical management. However, surgery is not indicated for stable and asymptomatic lesions not associated with tumors. In our case, tactical monitoring was suggested, since no other symptoms appeared. There are currently no other reported cases involving pilots, so an individual approach to treatment should be taken in accordance with their military health service, the potential, risk factors, and depending on the level of acceleration experienced. We discuss the pathogenesis, the clinical and radiological findings of this rare condition, and note that a spinal cyst is of special interest when occurring in pilots since they are exposed to intense accelerations and spinal strain."

He presented with severe low back pain, and imaging revealed features of discitis and paraspinal abscesses. On aspiration of the abnormal tissue, culture confirmed infection with M. bovis. Quadruple antituberculous therapy was commenced at this stage, with a subsequent good clinical response. Hematogenous spread of M. bovis is a rare, often delayed, complication of intravesical BCG therapy, but early appropriate treatment can result in a good prognosis."
CD008686,0,20127495,0,Higher risk of dural tears and recurrent herniation with lumbar micro-endoscopic discectomy.,"Existing studies on micro-endoscopic lumbar discectomy report similar outcomes to those of open and microdiscectomy and conflicting results on complications. We designed a randomised controlled trial to investigate the hypothesis of different outcomes and complications obtainable with the three techniques. 240 patients aged 18-65 years affected by posterior lumbar disc herniation and symptoms lasting over 6 weeks of conservative management were randomised to micro-endoscopic (group 1), micro (group 2) or open (group 3) discectomy. Exclusion criteria were less than 6 weeks of pain duration, cauda equina compromise, foraminal or extra-foraminal herniations, spinal stenosis, malignancy, previous spinal surgery, spinal deformity, concurrent infection and rheumatic disease. Surgery and follow-up were made at a single Institution. A biomedical researcher independently collected and reviewed the data. ODI, back and leg VAS and SF-36 were the outcome measures used preoperatively, postoperatively and at 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up. 212/240 (91%) patients completed the 24-month follow-up period. VAS back and leg, ODI and SF36 scores showed clinically and statistically significant improvements within groups without significant difference among groups throughout follow-up. Dural tears, root injuries and recurrent herniations were significantly more common in group 1. Wound infections were similar in group 2 and 3, but did not affect patients in group 1. Overall costs were significantly higher in group 1 and lower in group 3. In conclusion, outcome measures are equivalent 2 years following lumbar discectomy with micro-endoscopy, microscopy or open technique, but severe complications are more likely and costs higher with micro-endoscopy."
CD008686,0,20120827,0,Improving recognition of psoriatic arthritis.,"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a common form of inflammatory arthritis but is underdiagnosed. Psoriasis affects over 1.5% of the UK population. Around 15% of these patients will be diagnosed with PsA, but up to 40% may have evidence of arthritis if reviewed thoroughly. PsA can be difficult to diagnose as patients present with a variety of different patterns of arthritis. Most patients with PsA have relatively mild skin psoriasis, but some have more significant disease. Only 10-20% develop arthritis before their skin disease. Many patients have mild skin psoriasis that they are unaware of, or have not had diagnosed. Joint involvement is far more variable in PsA, compared with rheumatoid arthritis, and patients may present with: monoarthritis; oligoarthritis; involvement of the distal interphalangeal joints; a rheumatoid arthritis-like picture with multiple joints involved including the small joints in the hand or axial disease producing symptoms similar to ankylosing spondylitis. Features such as dactylitis (uniform sausage-like swelling of the whole digit either finger or toe) and enthesitis (inflammation at the sites of muscle or tendon attachment to bone) may also help diagnose PsA. Skin disease is present in the majority of patients although not all. Hidden areas for psoriasis include: behind the ears; at the top of the natal cleft and around the umbilicus. Larger joints, particularly the knees, can develop very big effusions causing obvious swelling. Areas to test for enthesitis should include the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, costochondral joints and the elbow. Patients with suspected PsA should be referred promptly to a rheumatologist for further assessment and treatment. Diagnosis of PsA can be made on clinical grounds but blood tests and radiographs are performed routinely to aid diagnosis. Initial therapy for PsA should include NSAIDs to ease pain and stiffness. Local injections of corticosteroids are recommended for peripheral arthritis (given IA) and dactylitis (usually by injection into the flexor tendon or adjacent joints). DMARDs are routinely used to treat all aspects of psoriatic disease, except spinal disease, and prescribing should be initiated by a specialist."
CD008686,0,20112889,0,Management of erectile dysfunction.,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most common sexual problem in men. The incidence increases with age and affects up to one third of men throughout their lives. It causes a substantial negative impact on intimate relationships, quality of life, and self-esteem. History and physical examination are sufficient to make a diagnosis of ED in most cases, because there is no preferred, first-line diagnostic test. Initial diagnostic workup should usually be limited to a fasting serum glucose level and lipid panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and morning total testosterone level. First-line therapy for ED consists of lifestyle changes, modifying drug therapy that may cause ED, and pharmacotherapy with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and smoking greatly increase the risk of ED. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are the most effective oral drugs for treatment of ED, including ED associated with diabetes mellitus, spinal cord injury, and antidepressants. Intraurethral and intracavernosal alprostadil, vacuum pump devices, and surgically implanted penile prostheses are alternative therapeutic options when phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors fail. Testosterone supplementation in men with hypogonadism improves ED and libido, but requires interval monitoring of hemoglobin, serum transaminase, and prostate-specific antigen levels because of an increased risk of prostate adenocarcinoma. Cognitive behavior therapy and therapy aimed at improving relationships may help to improve ED. Screening for cardiovascular risk factors should be considered in men with ED, because symptoms of ED present on average three years earlier than symptoms of coronary artery disease. Men with ED are at increased risk of coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular diseases."

CD008686,0,20082204,0,[Identification and grouping of pain patients according to claims data].,"The ICD classification does not provide the opportunity to adequately identify pain patients. Therefore we developed an alternative method for the identification and classification of pain patients which is based on prescription and diagnoses data from the year 2006 of one nationwide sickness fund (DAK) and which is led by two main assumptions: 1. Beneficiaries without prescription of an analgetic drug but with a diagnosis pattern that is characteristic of patients who are treated with opioids are also likely to be pain patients. 2. Each combination of diagnosis groups can be traced back to one primary diagnosis out of a diagnosis group according to the patient classification system CCS (Clinical Classifications Software). The selection of this diagnosis group (CCS) allows for the allocation of the beneficiary to only one pain type. As a result we identified 65 combinations of CCS diagnosis groups--aggregated to nine ""CCS pain types""--to which 77.1% of all patients with at least two opioid prescriptions can be allocated: 26.3% to pain due to arthrosis, 18.0% to pain due to intervertebral disc illnesses, 13.1% to other specific back pain, 6.7% to neuropathic pain, 4.5% to unspecific back pain, 4.2% to headache, 2.4% to pain after traumatic fractures, 1.3% to pain of multimorbid, high-maintenance patients, and 0.6% to cancer pain. Based on our method beneficiaries who have a high probability of suffering from moderate to strong pain can be identified and included in further claims data analyses of health care delivery and utilization pattern of pain-related disorders in Germany."

CD008686,0,20068278,0,[Pyogenic spondylitis following unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].,"Pyogenic spondylitis is regarded as a rare infectious disease. The incidence of this disease has been increasing recently due to an increase in the ratio of elderly people in the population as well as an increase in immunocompromised hosts complicated by cancer, diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is now performed widely as a curative treatment for various malignant hematological diseases. However, allogeneic HSCT causes chronic immunocompromise. There is no case report describing infectious spondylitis after HSCT. Here we describe a case of infectious spondylitis after HSCT and discuss risk factors and treatment. The patient was a 56-year-old female with AML-M1 who underwent allogeneic HSCT in our hospital. She developed back pain and fever about 150 days after HSCT and became unable to walk due to the severity of back pain. MRI T1 images showed a low intensity area, T2 images showed a high intensity area and Gd-DTPA-enhanced images showed a high intensity area at the S1-2 disk space. Clinical findings and MRI findings suggested pyogenic spondylitis. Back pain improved gradually after conservative treatment with meropenem (MEPM) for two weeks. After 4 weeks of MEPM administration, she had fully recovered and there has not been any recurrence of back pain to date. In conclusion, pyogenic spondylitis should be considered in the differential diagnoses for HSCT recipients with severe back pain."

CD008686,0,20064871,0,The evidence for whole-spine MRI in the assessment of axial spondyloarthropathy.,"In the past decade, fat-suppression MRI techniques have been increasingly used for the assessment of axial-SpA. Indeed, newly proposed classification criteria have suggested the inclusion of fat-suppression MRI for the evaluation of the SI joint in inflammatory back pain (IBP) of suspected axial-SpA. However, recent data on the whole spine have identified certain MRI spinal lesions to be highly diagnostic of axial-SpA; that the SI joint can be spared in axial-SpA; and that IBP may originate in the lumbar spine rather than SI joint. Therefore, it is proposed that MRI of the whole spine and not just the SI joint should now become a routine part of the assessment of axial-SpA. Not only is spinal MRI of great diagnostic utility in axial-SpA but there is also increasing evidence to suggest that it can play a significant role in the management, in particular directing anti-TNF therapy in AS, and also it may be prognostically useful in axial-SpA. With the wider availability, improving technology and falling cost of MRI, and the difficulty that clinical assessment of axial-SpA poses, especially in early disease, there is now a strong case for the use of whole-spine MRI in the diagnosis and management of axial-SpA."

CD008686,0,20060207,0,Diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for confounding radiation myelitis.,"We report a case of confounding radiation myelitis to demonstrate the usefulness of surgical biopsy in ensuring the correct diagnosis and to avoid unnecessary treatment. The patient was a 40-year-old man with a history of epiglottis carcinoma and sarcoidosis. Six months after radiation therapy and chemotherapy for epiglottis carcinoma, he noticed paresthesia and dysesthesia in the left arm and leg. Two months after that, he complained of severe neck pain and rapidly progressing weakness in all extremities. MRI showed an enhanced intramedullary lesion with extensive edema in the cervical spinal cord. Radiation myelitis, intramedullary spinal tumor, and neurosarcoidosis were considered as differential diagnoses. Spinal cord biopsy with laminectomy was performed and radiation myelitis was diagnosed. After the surgery, the lesion was significantly decreased in size even though corticosteroid therapy was rapidly tapered. We emphasize that a spinal cord biopsy is indicated to obtain a pathological diagnosis and to make a clear treatment strategy for patients with associated diseases causing lesions of the spinal cord."
CD008686,0,20054789,0,Ten years observation and treatment of multifocal pilocytic astrocytoma.,"Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) usually occurs in younger patients. It is a benign, generally well-delineated, WHO grade I tumour with favorable prognosis, which makes it different from diffuse astrocytomas, classified as higher grades of malignancy. A case study of PA was presented in a young female patient, observed and treated at the Neurosurgical Department for the period of 10 years, during which time she had frequent surgical procedures due to recurrence and dissemination of the tumour. The initial symptom of the disease was epileptic seizure at the age of 16. Neuroradiological study revealed cerebral tumour in the right temporal lobe, then the first temporal lobe surgery followed by re-operation and radiotherapy was performed. The patient developed hydrocephalus, treated with the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. After 5 years local recurrence of the tumour appeared in the right temporal region. The patient was operated and the tumour was totally removed. Initially, the histopathological diagnosis of ganglioglioma was suggested for primary tumour, finally the diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma for both recurrent and primary tumour was established. During the next years of observation increasing neurological symptoms in lower limbs developed. Subsequently, the patient reported pain syndrome in lumbosacral and perineal area. Consecutive MRI studies revealed a spinal canal tumours localized at the thoracic level and next at sacral level. The spinal tumour was surgically treated in both locations; the last operation was done 10 years after surgery of the primary temporal lobe tumour. Histopathological examinations of the excised foci from spinal canal revealed neoplasm consistent with WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma. The presented case indicates that despite the spread of the neoplastic process, a histopathologically benign tumour (WHO I grade) allows for long-term survival and observation period. Unfortunately, multifocal tumour involving midline structures causes major neurological symptoms and deficits. In the presented case we dealt now with the ascending spread process and the occurrence of the new foci in both subtentorial and parameningeal spaces inside the cranial cavity. It is a rare clinical manifestation of a disease ever described in the literature."

CD008686,0,20030695,0,Oncological emergencies: clinical importance and principles of management.,"Oncological emergencies are common conditions associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in unfavourable outcomes. Cancer itself, cancer-related hormones or cytokines, or treatment effects can cause emergency problems. Febrile neutropaenia, frequently associated with chemotherapy, can lead to life-threatening conditions. Treatment requires systematic evaluation and early empirical antibiotics. Hypercalcaemia of malignancy is the most common metabolic emergency in cancer patients. Non-specific clinical features may cause delay in diagnosis and increase morbidity and mortality. Treatment includes active fluid resuscitation, diuretics and intravenous bisphosphonates. Superior vena cava syndrome is usually caused by external compression. Computerised tomography is useful to confirm diagnosis, evaluate the extent of disease and guide invasive tissue diagnosis. Treatment and prognosis depend on the underlying malignancies. Spinal cord compression is a true emergency due to risk of permanent neurological impairment. Localised back pain is the most common presenting symptom while late presentation of neurological deficit is associated with irreversible outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging is the investigation of choice. Treatment includes corticosteroids, radiotherapy and/or decompressive surgery."
CD008686,0,20027112,0,Clinical and genetic aspects of neurofibromatosis 1.,"Neurofibromatosis 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple café-au-lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple cutaneous neurofibromas, and iris Lisch nodules. Learning disabilities are present in at least 50% of individuals with neurofibromatosis 1. Less common but potentially more serious manifestations include plexiform neurofibromas, optic nerve and other central nervous system gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, scoliosis, tibial dysplasia, and vasculopathy. The diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 1 is usually based on clinical findings. Neurofibromatosis 1, one of the most common Mendelian disorders, is caused by heterozygous mutations of the NF1 gene. Almost one half of all affected individuals have de novo mutations. Molecular genetic testing is available clinically but is infrequently needed for diagnosis. Disease management includes referral to specialists for treatment of complications involving the eye, central or peripheral nervous system, cardiovascular system, spine, or long bones. Surgery to remove both benign and malignant tumors or to correct skeletal manifestations is sometimes warranted. Annual physical examination by a physician familiar with the disorder is recommended. Other recommendations include ophthalmologic examinations annually in children and less frequently in adults, regular developmental assessment in children, regular blood pressure monitoring, and magnetic resonance imaging for follow-up of clinically suspected intracranial and other internal tumors."

Age of the patients at disease onset ranged from 3 to 15 years. The first clinical signs were pain in different locations, and urinary retention. Paraparesis or plegia reached its maximum within five days. By all patients spinal MRI and lumbar puncture were performed at admission. These results were interpreted together with the clinical signs, and therapy was started immediately. We used methylprednisolon pulse therapy. Within 10-30 days the patients started to walk. We have followed the children for 1.5-13 years. Few residual clinical signs were observed: by one child left sided spastic monoparesis persisted, by the other right sided latent monoparesis was stated, and by one partial urinary incontinence persisted. By the control spinal MRI persisting signal changes or atrophy were detected just by those two children who had residual clinical signs. In the follow-up period no clinical relapse occured. Neither did the brain or spinal MRI show new lesions. The quick diagnosis and the immediately started therapy determine mostly the clinical outcome of these children. We hope that our long follow-up period can help in better understanding the disease even in adult patients. In the future we try to join multicenter clinical studies."

We describe the case of a patient with SCLC treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. One month later, after finishing the scheduled treatment, the patient was admitted to the hospital again with symptoms of low back pain that radiated to bilateral lower legs with painful paresthesias, urinary incontinence, and constipation. After a series of examinations, including bone scan and magnetic resonance imaging, the patient received an L2-L3 laminectomy. The concluded diagnosis through histopathologic examination with immunohistochemistry was extramedullary-intradural spinal metastasis causing cauda equina syndrome. The metastatic tumour originated from the SCLC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of SCLC metastasized to the cauda equina causing cauda equina syndrome."

He assumed a functional abnormality of the suboccipital-high cervical spine, resulting in positional preference of the infant;s head. A broad spectrum of symptoms and complaints have been attributed to ""KiSS-Syndrome"". Patients are advised to undergo manual therapy, with pressure applied locally in order to readjust the cervical spine. Life threatening side-effects have been published repeatedly. We present two infants with brain tumours who developed torticollis and further neurological findings such as ataxia and reflex differences. In both cases, symptoms caused by the tumour were interpreted as ""KiSS-syndrome"", and appropriate diagnostics and therapy were delayed for months. There is no scientific evidence for the actual existence of ""KiSS-syndrome"" as a clinical entity or for the positive effects of manual therapy. Approximately 12% of all infants <12 months show a positional preference of the head, about 8% present with body asymmetry. Whereas most cases are benign, there is a long list of serious differential diagnoses for torticollis in infants. We give an updated review of the literature regarding ""KiSS-Syndrome"" and discuss the differential diagnostics in infants with torticollis."

CD008686,0,19999236,0,Reducing and eliminating neuropathic pain.,"Neuropathic pain is initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the central and/or peripheral nervous systems, including infection, trauma, metabolic abnormalities, and nerve compression, and is typically accompanied by hyperalgesia and allodynia. Neuropathic pain can be mild to excruciating, debilitating, difficult to manage, cause depression, decrease the quality of life, require extremity amputations, and has a variety of clinical symptoms. It effects up to 5% of the population, 70% of patients with advanced cancer and inflammatory pathologies, and 95% of patients with spinal cord injuries. The primary treatments of neuropathic pain are antidepressants, anticonvulsants, local anesthetic/topical agents, and opioids. The rapidly evolving symptom- and mechanism-based approaches to the treatment of neuropathic pain holds promise for improving the quality of life of patients with neuropathic pain. However, pharmacological treatment of the symptoms are difficult because of the limited understanding of the underlying causes of the pain, and the systemic levels of multiple side effects induced by various agents at an effective dose. Further, neuropathic pain is often refractory to conventional analgesic treatments, with most patients obtaining only partial relief with these agents, and with tolerability or side effects often limiting their use. Alternative treatments to pharmacology include peripheral or neuraxial nerve blockade, and implanted cortical or spinal cord stimulators. However, the great need remains for development of new and more effective approaches to reducing neuropathic pain. This review examines various approaches currently used for treatment of neuropathic pain and potential new and more effective approaches."

CD008686,0,19903594,0,[A positioning pillow to improve lumbar puncture in paediatric haematology-oncology patients: a randomized controlled trial.].,"ObjectivesLumbar punctures (LPs) are common in children with cancer. Although pain management during the LP has been well standardised, dealing with stress and anxiety is not well addressed yet. Our objective was to evaluate the potential improvement of the LPs success rate using a positioning pillow, to ensure maximum lumbar flexion, and allow paravertebral muscles to relax, in children who are awake, with either conscious sedation or no sedation.Patients and methodsChildren aged 2-18 years undergoing LPs were randomly assigned to a positioning pillow or no intervention. The primary outcome was the rate of success, i.e. achieving the LPs (sampling or injection) at the first attempt, without bleeding (RBC < 50/mm3). The secondary outcomes included: the child's pain, assessed by a self-administered visual analogical scales (VAS) for children over 6 years of age; the parents' and caregivers' perception of the child's pain; the satisfaction of the children, the parents, the caregivers and the physician. The child's cooperation and the occurrence of post-LP syndrome were also evaluated.ResultsOne hundred twenty-four children (62 in each group) were included. The LP pillow tended to increase the success rate of LPs (67 vs 57%; P = 0.23), and decreased the post-LP syndromes (15 vs 24%; P = 0.17) but the differences were not statistically significant. In children over 6-year of age (N = 72), the rate of success was significantly higher in the pillow group (58.5 vs 41.5%; P = 0.031), with a tendency to feel less pain (for less pain and better satisfaction) [median VAS: 25 vs 15 mm; P = 0.39] and being more satisfied (84.4 vs 75.0%; P = 0.34).ConclusionEven if the results presented here are not as optimistic as we might have wished, we can confirm that there is a benefit in using this pillow for LPs. It is especially promising in children over 6-year of age."

CD008686,0,19967372,0,Sacroplasty for local or massive localization of multiple myeloma.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of cementoplasty in the treatment of sacral multiple myelomas. We retrospectively reviewed the records of eight patients (four women and four men; age range 47-68 years; mean age 57.8) who underwent cementoplasty for painful osteolytic localization of multiple myeloma between April 2007 and May 2009. The patients had difficulty walking because of increasing pain. Six patients had persistent pain despite other cementoplasties for vertebral and femoral localization, whereas two patients referred at the time of diagnosis had only sacral lesions. The clinical indication for treatment was (1) a pain intensity score ≥5 on visual analogue scale (VAS) and (2) pain totally or partially refractory to analgesic treatment in patients with a life expectancy >3 months. Technical planning was based on computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. Six patients had previously undergone radiotherapy or chemotherapy and were receiving varying doses of analgesics, whereas sacroplasty represented the first treatment for two patients. Five patients had monolateral local involvement, and the other patients had massive involvement of the sacrum; Technical success was achieved in all cases. We had only one small and asymptomatic foraminal leak. All patients experienced improvement in symptoms after the procedure, as demonstrated by improved VAS scores and performance status (PS) and decreased analgesic dose constant during follow-up. In our experience, percutaneous stabilization can be used effectively and safely in patients with focal or extensive involvement of the sacrum by multiple myeloma."
CD008686,0,19963388,0,Clinical and radiographic results of balloon kyphoplasty for treatment of vertebral body metastases and multiple myelomas.,"Kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that is used to augment vertebral body strength. This technique has been commonly used to treat osteoporotic, vertebral body compression fractures. The technique was also used to augment painful metastatic vertebral fractures. The objective of this study was to review the clinical and radiological results after kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral body compression fractures due to spinal metastasis and multiple myeloma and to determine factors that may affect outcome. Thirty-one patients had 41 vertebral body fractures secondary to spinal metastasis or multiple myeloma. A kyphoplasty procedure was performed on 39 levels. The pain and neurological status were evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the American Spinal Injury Association classification scale scores, respectively. Radiological evaluations were used to measure vertebral body height loss (VBHL) and the segmental kyphosis angle before and after surgery. The major symptoms that patients presented with included pain (25 patients); and neurological deficit (four patients). Two patients presented with no symptoms because the metastases were found during cancer screening. The mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) VAS score was 7.2+/-2.2 before surgery and 1.6+/-1.3 after surgery. The mean preoperative VBHL was 27.8+/-11.3% for the thoracic spine and 27.7+/-12.5% for the lumbar spine. VBHL values were reduced to 22.4+/-10.0% and 18.4+/-10.4% for the thoracic and lumbar spine after surgery, respectively. The segmental kyphosis angles decreased from 21.2+/-11.4 degrees to 17.0+/-9.8 degrees for the thoracic spine and from 15.3+/-8.8 degrees to 10.4+/-7.2 degrees for the lumbar spine after surgery. There was a correlation between the symptom duration and VBH restoration rate. There was no correlation between the amount of injected polymethylmethacrylate and pain relief. We concluded that kyphoplasty is a safe and effective procedure for treating painful vertebral body fractures caused by metastasis and multiple myeloma. It can restore VBH and correct the kyphosis angle. While the increased amount of the injected PMMA led to its leakage, it did not contribute to restoration of the VBH or kyphosis correction. Therefore, one should avoid injection of excessive amounts of PMMA."
CD008686,0,19961812,0,Guideline update: what's the best approach to acute low back pain?,"GRADE A RECOMMENDATIONS (based on good-quality patient-oriented evidence): Advise patients to stay active and continue ordinary activity within the limits permitted by pain, avoid bed rest, and return to work early, which is associated with less disability. Consider McKenzie exercises, which are helpful for pain radiating below the knee. Recommend acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if medication is necessary. COX-2 inhibitors, muscle relaxants, and opiate analgesics have not been shown to be more effective than NSAIDs for acute low back pain. Consider imaging if patients have no improvement after 6 weeks, although diagnostic tests or imaging is not usually required. GRADE B RECOMMENDATIONS (based on inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence): Reassure patients that 90% of episodes resolve within 6 weeks-regardless of treatment. Advise patients that minor flares-ups may occur in the subsequent year. Consider a plain lumbosacral spine x-ray if there is suspicion of spinal fracture or compression. Consider a bone scan after 10 days, if fracture is still suspected or the patient has multiple sites of pain. Suspect cauda equina syndrome or severe or progressive neurological deficit if red flags are present. Obtain complete blood count, urinalysis, and sedimentation rate if cancer or infection are possibilities. If still suspicious, consider referral or perform other studies. Remember that a negative plain film x-ray does not rule out disease. GRADE C RECOMMENDATIONS (based on consensus, usual practice, opinion, disease-oriented evidence, or case series): Recommend ice for painful areas and stretching exercises. Discuss the use of proper body mechanics and safe back exercises for injury prevention. Refer for goal-directed manual physical therapy if there is no improvement in 1 to 2 weeks, not modalities such as heat, traction, ultrasound, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Do not refer for surgery in the absence of red flags."

We report two cases of secondary osteosarcoma arising after treatment for childhood hematologic malignancies (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lymphoblastic leukemia). A 10-year-old boy, at the age of 3, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He received chemotherapy, radiation, and bone-marrow transplantation and then was in complete remission. At 6 years, he complained of increasing pain of the right thigh and was diagnosed with osteoblastic osteosarcoma. A 26-year-old man, at the age of 6, was diagnosed as having acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). He received chemotherapy, radiation, and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). At 11 years after PBSCT, he visited with the complaint of left lumbar swelling. He was diagnosed with chondroblastic osteosarcoma. In both cases alkaline phosphatase (ALP) had already increased prior to the onset of the symptom. We should rule out secondary osteosarcoma at the abnormal elevation of ALP during clinical follow-up of patients after treatment of childhood hematologic malignancies."

Spinal radiosurgery provides excellent long-term radiographic control for vertebral metastases. Percutaneous cement augmentation using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) may be contraindicated in lesions with spinal canal compromise due to the risk of displacement of tumor resulting in spinal cord or cauda equina injury. However, there is also significant morbidity associated with open corpectomy procedures in patients with metastatic cancer, especially in those who subsequently require adjuvant radiotherapy. This study evaluated a treatment paradigm for malignant vertebral compression fractures consisting of transpedicular coblation corpectomy combined with closed fracture reduction and fixation, followed by spinal radiosurgery."

We highlight a case of a 75-year-old female household ambulator who presented with significant thoracolumbar pain and delayed T12 collapse after a ground-level fall. The patient had sustained a trivial fall at home 4 months prior to this presentation and had been hospitalized in our institution at that time for a general medical workup. Dedicated spine radiographs were not obtained during this visit. However, lateral chest radiograph demonstrated an intact T12 vertebral body. The patient was able to mobilize successfully with therapy and was discharged home. During the interim between the initial fall and subsequent presentation, she resumed physical activity including ambulating independently and performing various housework. Approximately 4 months following her initial injury, the patient returned to a local emergency department with vague complaints of abdominal pain without any history of recent fall or injury. After an unremarkable workup, the patient was sent home. Ten days later, she represented to our institution's emergency room with worsening pain. Radiographs and CT scan demonstrated interval collapse of the T12 vertebral body. A linear vacuum cleft was noted on X-rays and CT. An extensive workup to exclude other processes such as malignancy or infection, which was negative, ensued. Delayed post-traumatic vertebral collapse was diagnosed. A trial of medical management and therapy was attempted, but she continued to experience significant pain. A T12 vertebroplasty was therefore offered and performed to stabilize the injury and to relieve the pain. She was subsequently able to be discharged from the hospital and transitioned back to home life. At approximately 2 years following her injury, the patient was noted to be able to ambulate with a walking aid. Her final radiograph after her surgery demonstrated that the T12 vertebroplasty had maintained its height and sagittal alignment. This Grand Round case highlights the clinical presentation of Kummell's disease. Aspects of the clinical entity that will be discussed include a historical review of the disease, hallmark radiographic findings and treatment options."

The first case is developing normally but has severe limb anomalies, congenital constriction rings, scoliosis because of vertebral anomalies, a left accessory nipple, a small tumor-like swelling on his lower back with tiny skin tubular appendages, a hypoplastic scrotum, and an anchored penis. The second case is developmentally delayed with limb malformations, congenital constriction rings, a lumbar myelomeningeocele, hemangioma, and tiny tubular skin appendages on the back. The patient also had bilateral optic atrophy. The constellation of features in our patients cannot be fully explained by the amniotic disruption complex. The first patient may represent an additional case of the human homolog of the mouse disorganization mutant. The presence of bilateral optic atrophy in the second case, although without an absent septum pellucidum nor other brain anomalies resembles the infrequently reported disorder of septo-optic dysplasia with limb anomalies. Both cases were sporadic and could be caused by a new dominant mutation because of the high paternal age of case 1 and the history of paternal occupational exposure to heat for both fathers. We draw attention to the phenotypic overlap between the disorganization-like syndrome and septo-optic dysplasia with limb anomalies."

He had a history of primary spinal intramedullary malignant melanoma at the T6 level 18 years previously, which had remained stable for 18 years. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed central nervous system (CNS) dissemination of malignant melanoma. Whole brain radiation therapy (30 Gy), local radiation therapy (15 Gy), and routine intrathecal injection of interferon beta were performed. The progression of CNS dissemination of malignant melanoma was controlled without neurological deterioration for 38 months. The prognosis for primary CNS malignant melanomas better than that for cutaneous melanoma. However, the clinical course is still unknown, and CNS dissemination is regarded fatal. The unusually long survival in the present case indicates the effectiveness of the combined radiotherapy and interferon therapy."
CD008686,0,19940405,0,Intramedullary schwannoma of the conus medullaris complicated by dense adhesion to neural tissue.,"A 29-year-old man presented with an intramedullary schwannoma of the conus medullaris manifesting as an 8-month history of mild bladder dysfunction, sexual impotence, and paresthesia in the buttocks. Subtotal removal of the lesion was achieved, as part of the tumor showed dense adhesion to the rostral neural tissue, with only postoperative transient deterioration of bladder dysfunction. Intramedullary schwannoma, especially involving the conus medullaris and the proximal spinal cord, is relatively rare and the pathogenesis and pathophysiology are unclear. Complete resection is often advised to avoid recurrence, but tumor adhesion to neural tissue sometimes renders complete resection difficult, and may create the risk of unacceptable operative morbidity. The present case shows that transient neurological deterioration may occur even with just subtotal removal, leaving the adherent part. Therefore, recognition of the particular features and the strategy for treatment in intramedullary schwannoma of the conus medullaris is essential for making appropriate decisions on the degree of removal."

Left hemianopsia and choked disc were identified by an ophthalmologist who referred her to us. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a 5-cm homogeneously enhanced mass in the trigone of the right lateral ventricle. The tumor was totally removed by two stage surgery. The histological findings were consistent with HPC. HPC is very important to differentiate from meningioma and solitary fibrous tumors because HPC is more aggressive. The histological and immunochemical findings are important for the differential diagnosis. The present case showed no local recurrence or metastasis without radiation therapy for 4 years, indicating that radiation therapy is not absolutely imperative for patients with intraventricular HPC showing low MIB-1 staining index after total removal."

CD008686,0,19932564,0,Keratinocytes acting on injured afferents induce extreme neuronal hyperexcitability and chronic pain.,"Keratinocytes play an important role in the dialog between skin and cutaneous sensory neurons. They are an essential source of cutaneous nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin that contributes to persistent pain in inflammation and neuropathy. We studied the interaction of human keratinocytes (hKTs) and regenerating afferent nerve fibers by transplanting hKTs into a ligated and transected peripheral nerve. The hKTs self-assembled into a multi-laminar spheroid cellular structure resembling the stratum spinosum of epidermis. Axonal sprouts surrounded the structure although they were excluded from entry. Levels of NGF were elevated at the transplant site. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings from primary afferent neurons whose cut axons were present near the transplanted hKTs displayed extreme hyperexcitability. These neurons generated high frequency trains of action potentials during step depolarization stimuli, and they sometimes showed afterdischarge and fired spontaneously at resting membrane potential. This spontaneous firing originated from subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. The animals with the hKT transplants exhibited spontaneous pain behavior manifest as autotomy. The results demonstrate that an interaction between injured/regenerating nerve fibers and keratinocytes such as may occur during wound healing, results in afferent hyperexcitability and pain. These results have implications for persistent pain associated with burn and traumatic skin injuries."

We describe a 40-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer who presented with neck and shoulder pain of 1 week duration with no neurological deficit. Following clinical examination, radiographs taken of the cervical spine was normal. Radiographs repeated 3 weeks later revealed a large lytic lesion of the odontoid occupying 70-80% of the peg. Further investigation including magnetic resonance imaging and bone scan showed no further spinal lesions.

We report a case of transient lower limb pain following the accidental placement of an epidural catheter into the thoracic subarachnoid space. A 31-year-old woman was scheduled to undergo laparoscopic myomectomy. An epidural catheter was accidentally inserted subarachnoid at the T12-L1 intervertebral space with a 2-ml test dose of 2% lidocaine, and was promptly removed. Fulgurant pain and allodynia extending over the L2-5 areas of the left lower limb and buttock started immediately postoperatively. We treated the persistent pain in our patient with epidural infusion of local anesthetics and steroids during her hospital stay, and with carbamazepine and a tricyclic antidepressant after her discharge from the hospital. All signs of allodynia had disappeared on postoperative day 25. Sagittal and axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the Th12 level revealed a small high-intensity area without mass effect in the ipsilateral dorsal column. The patient's clinical course and MRI diagnosis suggested the inhibition of descending inhibitory pathways resulting from a lesion of the spinal cord as the possible etiology of the transient lower limb pain and allodynia."

CD008686,0,19910618,0,Transforaminal 5% phenol neurolysis for the treatment of intractable cancer pain.,"This is the first case report of using a transforaminal approach for phenol administration. A 76-yr-old patient with a history of leiomyosarcoma and multiple metastatic lesions had unremitting pain in the right thoracic and lumbar regions and had prohibitive opioid-induced side effects. The patient underwent phenol neurolysis using a transforaminal approach in 2 stages at 3 levels (L3-4, L1-2, and T12-L1). The patient had complete resolution of pain, without any complications, and opioid treatment was nearly discontinued. Transforaminal phenol neurolysis is a reasonable treatment option for patients suffering from intractable pain for whom conventional therapies have proven ineffective."
CD008686,0,19903623,0,A case of anterior maxillary radiolucency.,"A 46-year-old woman sought treatment for pain in her maxillary anterior teeth. Physical examination revealed facial tenderness and an expanded anterior maxilla, with palatal swelling in the approximate midline. The lesion had eroded through the midline anterior palate and anterior nasal spine and had shifted the nasal floor in a superior direction. Teeth No. 8-10 tested nonvital to electrical stimulation. The lesion was dissected carefully and lifted off the nasal floor while the patient was under general anesthesia. Histologically, the lesion was cystic with an epithelial lining composed of respiratory and squamous epithelium. As a result, a nasopalatine duct cyst was diagnosed."
CD008686,0,19902891,0,Osteoid osteoma: a diagnosis for radicular pain of extremities.,"Osteoid osteoma is a benign tumor commonly found in young patients. The most interesting feature of the tumor is its peculiar obvious pain. The intensity of pain produced by osteoid osteoma is unproportionate to its nature and size. Much has been written about the mechanism of this symptom of the tumor and the specific characteristics of the pain that can be misleading when appearing as radicular pain especially when some subtle neurologic signs and symptoms accompany the pain. In this article, 12 patients who were referred to our clinic with radicular pain and neurological signs and symptoms months after initiation of symptoms between 2000 and 2008 are presented. Of these 12 patients, most were first thought to have root compression disease before being referred to our hospital. Precise history taking and special attention to physical examinations led to a suspicion of osteoid osteoma. Plain radiographs, computed tomography, and bone scans indicated osteoid osteoma, and excisional biopsy confirmed its diagnosis. Osteoid osteoma should always be considered in young patients with radicular pain, even with subtle neurological signs and symptoms."
CD008686,0,19901958,0,Bone health and prostate cancer.,"Bone metastases are a substantial burden to men with advanced prostate cancer as they often cause pain and can cause fractures and spinal cord compression. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are both pathologically activated in the setting of prostate cancer bone metastases. As osteoclast activation is associated with disease progression, skeletal complications and death, osteoclast-targeted therapies are a rational approach to disease management. Zoledronic acid is standard of care for castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases as it reduces the risk for skeletal-related events. Additional trials are needed to better define the ideal dose, frequency and duration of zoledronic acid therapy. No bisphosphonate has yet been shown to prevent bone metastases or to benefit men with androgen-sensitive disease. Denosumab is an experimental osteoclast-targeted monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand. Two ongoing phase III trials are expected to define its efficacy in preventing bone metastases and disease-related skeletal events in men with prostate cancer. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer is associated with osteoporosis and fragility fractures. Several bisphosphonates have been shown to improve bone mineral density in men receiving ADT. Two recent phase III trials have shown that denosumab and toremifene reduce the incidence of fragility fractures in these men. The World Health Organization has developed a fracture risk assessment model (FRAX) for the general population to guide the selection of patients who may benefit from pharmacotherapy. In the absence of a prostate cancer-specific algorithm, we advocate the use of FRAX for men receiving ADT."
CD008686,0,19901717,0,Multiple extradural spinal arachnoid cysts causing diffuse myelomalacia of the spinal cord.,Extradural spinal cyst is a rare cause of compression myelopathy.

We present a case of multiple spinal arachnoid cysts causing diffuse myelomalacia secondary to a significant compression of the spinal cord with no symptom relief after surgical decompression.
CD008686,0,19898915,0,"Extracerebellar MRI-lesions in ataxia telangiectasia go along with deficiency of the GH/IGF-1 axis, markedly reduced body weight, high ataxia scores and advanced age.","Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive ataxia, neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition. Pathoanatomical studies reported a degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells as the striking feature of the disease. Although recent studies suggested the involvement of extracerebellar structures such as the brainstem and basal ganglia, this has rarely been studied in human AT. Thus, we performed a detailed cliniconeuroradiological investigation of 11 AT patients, aged 8 to 26 years by collecting clinical neurological data, ataxia scores, growth status, body mass index (BMI), growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like-growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and correlated them to extracerebellar neuroimaging findings in human AT. Neuroimaging was done by cranial and spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo and fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences. We compared clinical and neuroradiological findings of six patients with IGF-1 levels and BMI below the third percentile to five patients with normal IGF-1 serum levels and BMI above the third percentile. Three of the six first mentioned patients older than 20 years and two patients older than 12 years showed noticeable high Klockgether ataxia scores above 25 points. Three of these patients presented with marked hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white matter of T2-weighted MR images. Interestingly, all six patients suffered from marked spinal atrophy. Two of the patients presented with severe extra-pyramidal symptoms, but only one patient showed associated MRI abnormalities of the basal ganglia. MRI in patients with normal IGF-1 levels showed the expected cerebellar lesions in four patients, whereas spinal atrophy was found only in two patients. There was no affection of the cerebral white matter or basal ganglia in this group. We conclude that central cerebral white matter affection, spinal atrophy, and extrapyramidal symptoms are more often present in patients with pronounced deficiency of the GH/IGF-1 axis accompanied by markedly reduced body weight and high ataxia scores. This may point to a major role of IGF-1 and nutritional status in neuroprotective signaling."

An intraspinal fluid-filled collection of variable dimensions is frequently observed on spine MR imaging in patients with idiopathic superficial siderosis. A similar finding has also been reported in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypotension. The authors report on a patient with superficial siderosis and a longitudinally extensive intraspinal fluid-filled collection secondary to a dural tear. The patient had a history of low-pressure headaches. His spine MR imaging and spine CT suggested the possibility of an underlying vascular malformation, but none was found on angiography. Repair of the dural tear resulted in resolution of the intraspinal fluid collection and CSF abnormalities. The significance of the association between superficial siderosis and idiopathic intracranial hypotension, and potential therapeutic and pathophysiological implications, are the subject of this report."

A subsequent diagnostic evaluation revealed the presence of a glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are rare, benign, small vascular tumors, which originate from glomus bodies present in the reticular dermis. Glomus tumors constitute less than 2.0% of all primary soft tissue tumors, approximately 80% of the lesions are located in the upper extremity, and more than 75% are subungually located. However, many locations have been reported in the literature. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this glomus tumor that occurred on the back is very rare."
CD008686,0,19881247,0,Clinical usefulness of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET in a case with multiple bone metastases of carcinoid tumor after ten years.,"We report a peculiar case in an 80-year-old man with multiple bone metastases due to the recurrence of thymic carcinoid tumor after surgical resection and radiation therapy ten years earlier. He was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of lumbago. Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET was useful for recognition of multiple bone metastases due to the recurrence of thymic carcinoid tumor, while (201)Tl-whole body scintigraphy and by (99)mTc-methylene diphosphonate ((99)mTc-MDP) bone scintigraphy did not reveal the metastases. Finally, we performed a CT-guided bone biopsy from lumbar vertebra and could obtain the diagnosis of metastases of carcinoid tumor histologically. As evident in this case, it is important to consider the recurrence of carcinoid tumor even if a long time has passed after the surgical resection and radiation therapy; also FDG-PET may be a useful diagnostic imaging modality to detect metastases from thymic carcinoid tumor to other organs."

CD008686,0,19864202,0,Radicular cyst with actinomycotic infection in an upper anterior tooth.,"Actinomycosis is an infection caused by filamentous, branching, Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria. It rarely infects the jawbone. This case report describes a patient with a left maxillary central incisor with an apical lesion and actinomycotic infection. A 23-year-old male patient underwent conventional root canal treatment of tooth 21, in a local dental clinic for about 1 year. However, percussion pain and a sinus tract that originated from tooth 21 were still present after treatment. Nonsurgical root canal treatment of tooth 21 was performed again but failed to relieve the symptoms. Therefore, apicoectomy and retrograde filling of the apical root canal with mineral trioxide aggregate were carried out. Periradicular bony defect was grafted by biocompatible material, and postoperative antibiotics (250 mg amoxicillin) were given three times daily for 5 days. Pathological examination of the removed periapical tissue showed a radicular cyst with actinomycosis. At the 9-month postoperative recall, the sinus tract had disappeared and radiographic examination showed healing of the apical lesion. Periradicular actinomycosis is one important reason for failure of nonsurgical endodontic treatment. Clinically, if the tooth shows a recurrent sinus tract and poor response to conventional root canal treatment combined with antibiotic control, apical actinomycotic infection should be highly suspected, and an alternative endodontic surgical approach is needed for successful treatment."

A 54-year-old Caucasian male presented with a several-year history of progressive, vague bilateral upper and lower extremity paresthesias and pain. MRI of the spine revealed a heterogenously enhancing mass in the dorsal aspect of the spinal canal at the level of the atlas with mild spinal cord compression. The lesion was resected and upon gross and histologic examination it was a cavernous malformation embedded within a branch of the spinal accessory nerve. Post-operatively, the patient had no complications and some improvement in his symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with a spinal accessory nerve cavernous malformation, and this should be considered in the differential of lesions in the craniocervical region."

CD008686,0,19827352,0,[Collection of hematopoietic progenitor cells from healthy donors].,"Allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) transplantation is an established therapy for many hematologic disorders. HPCs may be collected from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. In order to minimize the risk for healthy HPC donors, thorough investigation is required before donation. The donor work-up should include medical history, physical examination, ECG, chest x-ray, blood count, coagulation screening, and testing for infectious disease markers. Donors should be fully informed on the donation procedure and sign an informed consent for donation. HPCs are traditionally collected from bone marrow with the donor in general anesthesia. The procedure includes multiple bone marrow aspirates from pelvic bones and at least overnight hospital stay. Although marrow donation is generally safe and well tolerated, minor complications like pain at the collection site, fatigue and pain on walking or sitting may occur in a relatively small proportion of donors (6%-20%). Major and life-threatening complications such as anesthesia-related events, mechanical injury to the bone, sacroiliac joint and sciatic nerve following marrow donation are relatively rare, being estimated to 0.1%-0.3% of cases. In the last decade, peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have become an increasingly used altemative to bone marrow. PBPC transplantation offers faster hematopoietic recovery and lower early transplant-related morbidity and mortality. The incidence of acute graft vs. host disease (GvHD) is no greater than in bone marrow transplants. However, there is evidence for increased chronic GvHD, which is in part related to the higher number of T and NK cells that are collected with PBPC and re-infused to the patient. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is used to mobilize PBPCs for collection by leukapheresis. Leukapheresis is usually perfomed after 4 to 5 days of G-CSF subcutaneous administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg b.w. Vascular access for apheresis may be accomplished by use of apheresis needle in antecubital vein. Placement of a double-lumen central apheresis catheter is rarely required in healthy donors. Citrate is the most commonly used anticoagulant for apheresis. One to three leukapheresis procedures are required to collect adequate graft. There is an interindividual variation in progenitor cell mobilization among healthy donors, with a subset of donors that do not exhibit effective CD34+ cell mobilization. Donor age and G-CSF schedule are the factors that significantly affect PBPC mobilization and collection in healthy donors. Procedures for mobilization and collection of PBPC from healthy donors are generally well tolerated. Common adverse reactions of G-CSF application include bone pain, myalgia, headache and fatigue. Beside these mild side effects, moderate to life-threatening complications are sporadically observed. Spontaneous splenic rupture, acute lung injury, acute iritis, severe pyogenic infections, and anaphylactoid reactions were reported in healthy donors after G-CSF administration. Adverse effects of apheresis for PBPC collection are the same as for other apheresis procedure and include complications related to venous access and citrate toxicity. Leukapheresis typically results in a lower platelet count, an effect that is exacerbated by the use of G-CSF, which has been documented to cause mild, reversible thrombocytopenia. Fewer side effects were noted in pediatric donors compared to adult donors. PBPC collection in pediatric donors is safe and desired PBPC yields are easily achieved. Theoretical concerns exist about the potentially increasing long-term risk of leukemia after G-CSF administration in healthy donors. Recently, a report of AML developing in a 62-year-old female donor 14 months after G-CSF-primed PBPC donation has been published. Whether G-CSF therapy contributed to the development of this cancer is unknown, but future studies should carefully follow the donors and report any similar event. According to currently available evidence, the risk of major late toxicities secondary to administration of G-CSF is minimal."
CD008686,0,19818628,0,Evaluation of quality of life parameters in patients who have syringomyelia.,"Syringomyelia is a centromedullary syndrome that can be treated conservatively or with various neurosurgical procedures. We hypothesized that different clinical subgroups of patients exist, which would necessitate the need for individualised neurosurgical intervention and maintenance to achieve optimal quality of life (QoL). Using both the short-form 36-item (SF-36) questionnaire and the Syringomyelia Disability Index, clinical and QoL data was prospectively assessed in 142 patients with syringomyelia. Cluster analysis was then performed on the subscale results of the SF-36. The SF-36 scores of those with syringomyelia were significantly lower than those of the general German population, as well as when compared to those patients suffering from other chronic diseases. The SF-36 scores were independent of the syringomyelia patients' underlying syrinx pathology. Cluster analysis of the QoL patterns revealed four indicative patient groups. Syringomyelia is a chronic, progressive disease, and the syrinx itself appears to be the source of the symptoms, rather than the underlying pathology. The identified QoL subgroups in syringomyelia patients indicate the necessity of appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the pathology so that expansion of the syrinx cavity is reduced, maintaining QoL and functionality of these patients."

CD008686,0,19789074,0,Preclinical and early clinical investigations related to monoaminergic pain modulation.,"The balance between descending controls, both excitatory and inhibitory, can be altered in various pain states. There is good evidence for a prominent alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibitory system and 5-HT(3) (and likely also 5-HT(2)) serotonin receptor-mediated excitatory controls originating from brainstem and midbrain areas. The ability of cortical controls to influence spinal function allows for top-down processing through these monoamines. The links between pain and the comorbidities of sleep problems, anxiety, and depression may be due to the dual roles of noradrenaline and of 5-HT in these functions and also in pain. These controls appear, in the cases of peripheral neuropathy, spinal injury, and cancer-induced bone pain to be driven by altered peripheral and spinal neuronal processes; in opioid-induced hyperalgesia, however, the same changes occur without any pathophysiological peripheral process. Thus, in generalized pain states in which fatigue, mood changes, and diffuse pain occur, such as fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome, one could suggest an abnormal engagement of descending facilitations with or without reduced inhibitions but with central origins. This would be an endogenous central malfunction of top-down processing, with the altered monoamine systems underlying the observed symptoms. A number of analgesic drugs can either interact with or have their actions modulated by these descending systems, reinforcing their importance in the establishment of pain but also in its control."
CD008686,0,19787015,0,Polymethylmethacrylate and radioisotopes in vertebral augmentation: an explanation of underlying principles.,"We recently reported a novel concept for combining radioactive isotope technology with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement used for vertebral augmentation and have advocated that pain physicians become aware of this new concept when treating malignant compression fractures. The use of vertebral augmentation for malignant compression fractures is steadily increasing, and the goal of this novel approach would be to stabilize the fractured vertebral body while also controlling proliferation of the tumor cells in the vertebral body that caused the vertebral fracture. This approach would therefore provide mechanical stabilization of the fractured vertebral body at the same time as direct targeting of the cancer cells causing the fracture. For our analysis, we investigated six specific radioisotopes with regard to physical and biologic properties as they would interact with PMMA and local bone metastatic disease, taking into consideration anatomical, biological and physical characteristics. The radioisotopes investigated include beta emitting (plus and minus) sources, as well as low energy and mid-energy photon sources and are: P-32, Ho-166, Y-90, I-125, F-18, and Tc-99m. We review the advantages and disadvantages of each radioisotope. In addition, this paper serves to provide pain physicians with a basic background of the biologic principles (Biologically Effective Dose) and statistical modeling (Monte Carlo method) used in that analysis. We also review the potential complications when using radioactive sources in a clinical setting. Understanding the methodologies employed in determining isotope selection empowers the practitioner by fostering understanding of this presently theoretical treatment option. We believe that embedding radioisotopes in PMMA is merely a first step in the road of local treatment for symptomatic local lesions in the setting of systemic disease."
CD008686,0,19777924,0,[Giant lipoma on the back].,"Solitary lipoma is the most frequent soft tissue tumor, often appearing between 40 and 60 years of age.

Its volume is the source of a good many problems in social life (camouflage, difficulties to dress) and causes multiple health problems such as pain, difficulties to sleep, compressions of nerves or vital structures, infections, etc. The diagnosis is primarily clinical. However, it is necessary to systematically exclude a malignant process. Surgical biopsy is recommended if the diagnosis cannot be asserted by the clinic or an imagery. The therapeutic attitude is abstention in case of small volume without functional impairment. Otherwise, total surgical excision is indicated with pathological analysis.

CD008686,0,19774815,0,Quality of life in patients following percutaneous PMMA acetabuloplasty for acetabular metastasis due to carcinoma.,"Pain is the main symptom of acetabular osteolysis from metastatic carcinoma, and it is frequently associated with pathologic fractures. Radiotherapy alone usually is not effective for pain control, and it does not allow weight bearing. Surgical procedures requiring an aggressive approach and consequently high morbidity are rarely indicated in patients with multiple metastases. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) has been widely used in oncologic and spinal surgery as a bone filler. We evaluated the functional results of percutaneous injection of PMMA in 20 patients (24 acetabula) with acetabular osteolysis from metastatic carcinoma. Patients were assessed before and after percutaneous acetabuloplasty, evaluating pain, mobility of the hip joint, general condition, use of analgesics, using the SF-36, QLQ-C30, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale and Harris Hip Score. There was a marked clinical improvement in all patients during the first six post-operative months, with gradual worsening thereafter from deterioration of their general condition over the 12-month follow-up period.

The extension of such cysts averages 3.7 vertebral bodies. The diagnosis is clinical and radiological with the use of MRI, CT myelography or a combination of both. The best treatment option is complete removal of the cyst. However, even when paresis is regressing there is no good recovery from neuropathic pain. Laminectomy approach can cause postoperative complications especially when the cyst(s) expand(s) in more than one level. Alternatively, a cyst fenestration can be performed, including the levels of the maximal spinal cord compression. The clinical outcome is as good as after the cyst resection enabling the patient to walk again. The neuropathic pain may persist and require medication. A clinical case is presented, and the literature is reviewed. In the present case we report a patient with intradural arachnoid cysts extending from T6 to L2 and causing severe gait ataxia as well as neuropathic pain and hypaesthesia. The spinal-cord was compressed at T8 and T12. Surgical treatment with partial cyst resection in the compressed levels with an interlaminar approach brought similar results as complete resection. The patient was able to walk without help which was not possible before surgery. The cysts' extension is impressive as well as the minimal operative procedure."

CD008686,0,19744678,0,[Buttocks sciatic pain].,"Confusion between radicular and nerve trunk syndrome is not rare. With sciatic pain, any nerve trunk pain or an atypical nerve course should suggest nerve trunk pain of the sciatic nerve in the buttocks. The usual reflex with sciatic pain is vertebral-radicular conflict. The absence of spinal symptoms and the beginning of pain in the buttocks and not in the lumbar region should reorient the etiologic search. Once a tumor of the nerve trunk has been ruled out (rarely responsible for pain other than that caused by tumor pressure), a myofascial syndrome should be explored searching for clinical, electrophysiological, and radiological evidence of compression of the sciatic trunk by the piriform muscle but also the obturator internus muscle. Hamstring syndrome may be confused with this syndrome. Treatment is first and foremost physical therapy. Failures can be treated with classical CT-guided infiltrations with botulinum toxin. Surgery should only be entertained when all these solutions have failed."

Esophageal perforations can be spontaneous, iatrogenic, or malignant. We report two cases of esophageal perforations caused by thoracic osteophytes and different management strategies leading to successful outcomes. An 80-year-old male presented with chest pain and dysphagia following a fall. On endoscopy, an esophageal perforation and foreign body was noted which was confirmed as a thoracic osteophyte on computed tomography scan. He was managed conservatively as he declined surgery. A 63-year-old male was admitted with dysphagia following a food bolus obstruction. Following esophagoscopy and dilatation, there was clinical and radiological evidence of perforation. During surgery, a thoracic osteophyte was identified as the cause of perforation. The perforation was closed in layers and the osteophyte was trimmed. Both patients recovered well. Thoracic osteophytes are a rare cause of esophageal perforations and a high index of suspicion is required in patients with osteoarthritis who present with esophageal perforations."
CD008686,0,19731626,0,Therapy of spondyloarthritides.,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the major subtype and a major outcome of an interrelated group of rheumatic diseases now named as spondyloarthritides (SpA). The most important clinical features of this group are inflammatory back pain (IBP), asymmetric peripheral oligoarthritis, predominantly of the lower limbs, enthesitis and specific organ involvement such as anterior uveitis, psoriasis and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Aortic root involvement and conduction abnormalities are rare complications ofAS. For clinical purposes, five subgroups are differentiated: AS, psoriatic SpA (PsSpA), reactive SpA (ReSpA), SpA associated with inflammatory bowel disease (SpAIBD) and undifferentiated SpA (uSpA). The SpA are genetically linked, the strongest known contributing factor is the MHC class I molecule HLA B27, ARTS-7, and IL-23R, others still remain to be identified. Most frequently and characteristically, AS starts in the sacroiliac joints at a mean age of26 years affecting men only slightly more frequent than women. In about 80% of the patients the disease spreads to the spine where all three segments are affected, most frequently the thoracic spine. Osteodestructive structural changes such as erosions occur less frequently than osteoproliferative changes which are pathognomonic for AS being clinically impressive by their appearance as syndesmophytes and ankylosis. Established classification criteria for AS and SpA perform less well in early disease stages. This partly contributes to the delay of diagnosis which is in the range of 5-10 years-mainly due the high frequency of back pain in the population. Major factors to improve the rate of AS patients diagnosed early are HLA B27 and imaging of the sacroiliac joints. International recommendations for the management ofAS have been published. The conventional treatment is mainly based on NSAIDs, patients with peripheral arthritis may be treated with sulfasalazine and patients with persistently active disease benefit from therapy with anti-TNF agents. Physiotherapy is of major importance in the general approach to patients with AS."

Laboratory investigation demonstrated an elevated serum calcium level and renal dysfunction. Systemic bone X-ray survey disclosed only a solitary osteolytic lesion. Circulating plasma cells demonstrated CD19(-)/CD56(-) and MPC-1(-)/CD49e(-)/CD45(+/-), the latter indicating the immature phenotype of the tumor cells. Bone marrow was occupied with immature, atypical plasma cells, of which cytoplasms were positive for IgE by direct immunofluorescence analysis. Chromosomes revealed a translocation of (11;14)(q13;q32), which is concordant with cyclinD1-protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. He was treated with dexamethasone and vincristine, which somewhat improved the laboratory findings. He died of tumor progression after 4-month admission.

She was evaluated by a gynaecologist and submitted to pelvic ecography without finding relevant alterations. In the successive hours, she presented severe headache in occipital region and in the posterior neck, poorly responsive to analgesic drugs. A cerebral CT scan was performed and was normal, and the patient came to our Department of Neurology. The neurological examination on admission was normal. This woman had a 7 years of long-lasting history of headache, diagnosed in another hospital as migraine without aura, and she referred a recent and progressive worsening of both the frequency and the severity of the headache. In the suspect of subarachnoidal haemorrhage, a lumbar puncture was performed, and was negative for bleeding, showing only a mild increase in the number of cells (12 leucocytes). Following the lumbar puncture, the patient presented a dramatic improvement of the headache. In the successive days, she lamented sellar hypoesthesia and, when asked, she referred a recent history of urinary and faecal retention. She was, therefore, submitted to an NMR of the lumbar and sacral medulla with evidence of a voluminous extradural formation in the sacral region suggestive for extradural sacral meningeal cyst. She was finally dispatched to the Department of Neurosurgery for surgical asportation of the cyst."
CD008686,0,19722068,0,What do general neurologists need to know about neuropathic pain?,"Neuropathic pain (NP) is defined as pain caused by lesion or dysfunction of the somatosensory system, as a result of abnormal activation of the nociceptive pathway (small fibers and spinothalamic tracts). The most common causes of this syndrome are the following: diabetes, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, HIV infection, cancer. In the last few years, the NP has been receiving special attention for two main reasons: (1) therapeutical refractoriness of a variety of pain syndromes with predominant neuropathic characteristics and (2) the development of diagnostic tools for neuropathic pain complaints. The present review article provides relevant information on the understanding and recognition of NP, as well as evidence-based therapeutic approaches."

CD008686,0,19715741,0,TRPA1 expression in human lingual nerve neuromas in patients with and without symptoms of dysaesthesia.,"The TRPA1 receptor is a member of the ankyrin family and is found in both spinal and trigeminal neurones. There is evidence to suggest that this receptor may be a sensor of noxious thermal stimuli in normal animals. After nerve injury, TRPA1 shows increased expression in uninjured axons, and has been implicated in the development and maintenance of hyperalgesia. We examined expression of TRPA1 in lingual nerve neuromas and investigated any potential correlation with the presence or absence of symptoms of dysaesthesia. Thirteen neuroma-in-continuity specimens were obtained from patients undergoing repair of a lingual nerve that had previously been damaged during lower third molar removal. Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to record the degree of pain, tingling and discomfort. Tissue was processed for indirect immunofluorescence and the percentage area of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive neuronal tissue also labelled for TRPA1 was quantified. No significant difference between levels of TRPA1 in neuromas from patients with or without symptoms of dysaesthesia and no relationship between TRPA1 expression and VAS scores for pain, tingling or discomfort were observed. TRPA1 expression and the time after initial injury that the specimen was obtained also showed no correlation. These data show that TRPA1 is expressed in lingual nerve neuromas, but, it appears that, at this site, TRPA1 does not play a principal role in the development of neuropathic pain."

Although no clear etiology has been identified, the prevailing theory is that mechanical strain affects the auricular portion of the ilium and causes premature arthritis. The location of the sclerosis has been traditionally confined to the ilium and may give the false impression of sacro-iliac joint involvement. Clinicians must be guided by history, radiographic findings, and laboratory studies in differentiating OCI with other disorders; furthermore additional causes of low back pain including metastatic disease and ankylosing spondylitis must be ruled out. Treatments for the condition are primarily conservative (therapies, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and steroid injections), with surgical resection being reserved for refractory cases."

CD008686,0,19668771,0,Optic nerve sheath meningocele.,"A 53-year-old man presented with a 5-month history of visual loss in his left eye. Visual acuity could be corrected to 20/20 with an increased hyperopic correction. Dilated funduscopy showed faint choroidal folds and elevation of the left optic disc. The coronal view of T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a fluid-filled dilated sheath surrounding normal optic nerves. General physical examination and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were normal. The subject was diagnosed as having dural ectasia of the optic nerve sheath and followed a course of acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily for three months, and displayed good anatomical and functional results during a 2-year follow-up period. Despite the fact that several authors have recommended an optic nerve decompression, most of the patients follow a benign clinical course. The role of corticosteroids is not described in the literature. Raised levels of proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid in the perioptic subarachnoidal space could be a determining factor. On the basis of an osmotic gradient between the cerebral subarachnoid space and perioptic subarachnoid space, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors could be beneficial. In contrast to other reports, we believe that surgical intervention could be reserved for patients with rapid or progressive optic nerve dysfunction."
CD008686,0,19668291,0,"Comprehensive review of epidemiology, scope, and impact of spinal pain.","Persistent pain interfering with daily activities is common. Chronic pain has been defined in many ways. Chronic pain syndrome is a separate entity from chronic pain. Chronic pain is defined as, ""pain that persists 6 months after an injury and beyond the usual course of an acute disease or a reasonable time for a comparable injury to heal, that is associated with chronic pathologic processes that cause continuous or intermittent pain for months or years, that may continue in the presence or absence of demonstrable pathologies; may not be amenable to routine pain control methods; and healing may never occur."" In contrast, chronic pain syndrome has been defined as a complex condition with physical, psychological, emotional, and social components. The prevalence of chronic pain in the adult population ranges from 2% to 40%, with a median point prevalence of 15%. Among chronic pain disorders, pain arising from various structures of the spine constitutes the majority of the problems. The lifetime prevalence of spinal pain has been reported as 54% to 80%. Studies of the prevalence of low back pain and neck pain and its impact in general have shown 23% of patients reporting Grade II to IV low back pain (high pain intensity with disability) versus 15% with neck pain. Further, age related prevalence of persistent pain appears to be much more common in the elderly associated with functional limitations and difficulty in performing daily life activities. Chronic persistent low back and neck pain is seen in 25% to 60% of patients, one-year or longer after the initial episode. Spinal pain is associated with significant economic, societal, and health impact. Estimates and patterns of productivity losses and direct health care expenditures among individuals with back and neck pain in the United States continue to escalate. Recent studies have shown significant increases in the prevalence of various pain problems including low back pain. Frequent use of opioids in managing chronic non-cancer pain has been a major issue for health care in the United States placing a significant strain on the economy with the majority of patients receiving opioids for chronic pain necessitating an increased production of opioids, and escalating costs of opioid use, even with normal intake. The additional costs of misuse, abuse, and addiction are enormous. Comorbidities including psychological and physical conditions and numerous other risk factors are common in spinal pain and add significant complexities to the interventionalist's clinical task. This section of the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP)/Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines evaluates the epidemiology, scope, and impact of spinal pain and its relevance to health care interventions."

CD008686,0,19661172,0,A proposed methodology to select radioisotopes for use in radionuclide therapy.,"The American Journal of Neuroradiology has played a seminal role in the history of vertebral augmentation (VA). Because VA is increasingly being included in the multidisciplinary management of malignant vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), combined therapeutic approaches that include strategies to treat metastatic disease along with the fracture have become appealing options for patients. To that end, we recently investigated the dosimetric feasibility of treating malignant VCFs with radionuclide therapy. The goal would be to provide local control of the systemic disease beyond the pain relief and structural support provided by polymethylmethacrylate cement. The purpose of this article is to propose a methodology for evaluating radionuclides for use in radiation therapy that takes into account a number of factors including radiation characteristics, biochemical effects, production capacity, and safety. The goal of such a methodology is to introduce a systematic approach to selecting radionuclides in designing treatment regimens and future investigations and also to stimulate discussion and experimentation involving new radionuclides that may provide more effective treatments than the current isotopes in widespread use."

The pain worsened in a seated position or after long periods of standing. A T1-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the sacrum and coccyx revealed a well-demarcated intraosseous lesion with homogeneous low signal intensity, while T2-weighted MRIs demonstrated homogeneous high signal intensity. An excisional biopsy revealed benign notochord cell tumor. The biopsy proved to be effective, as it relieved the patient's coccydynia. Due to the rarity of intraosseous benign notochordal cell tumors, it is essential to document and review this type of tumor. Only 2 benign notochordal cell tumors involving the coccyx have been previously reported, both of which presented with the same clinical symptoms of chronic coccydynia as our patient, likely due to the location of the involved lesion. The other leading diagnosis in our patient was chordoma, a malignant and locally aggressive neoplasm that is important to consider and exclude. Although chordomas have been well characterized in the surgery, pathology, and radiology literature, the benign notochordal cell tumor is a relative newcomer."
CD008686,0,19633406,0,Lumbar congestive myelopathy mimicking neoplasia without concurrent vascular malformation.,"A 78-year-old male presented with congestive myelopathy manifesting as progressive gait disturbance following conservative therapy for lumbar spinal canal stenosis, with suspected spinal cord tumor in the conus medullaris. His past medical history was unremarkable and he was not aware of any traumatic injury in the back or infectious disease. On admission, he had clumsy hand, moderate paraparesis, significant sensory disturbance below the L5 level, and severe vesicorectal dysfunction. The deep tendon reflex was promoted in the upper extremities, but poorly induced in the lower extremities. Blood examination found no abnormalities including values of tumor markers. Cerebral, cervical, and thoracic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed no contributory pathology without spondylotic change at the C3-C6 levels. Lumbar MR imaging showed fusiform swelling of the cord from the T10 to T12-L1 levels, with rimlike enhancement at the T12-L1 levels by gadolinium. The patient underwent surgery. Intraoperatively, the dorsal surface of the affected cord was pale, not swollen, and sparsely vascularized without tortuous vessels. Midline myelotomy caused escape of creamy material that was identified as necrotic neural tissue. A collapsed vessel, located on the surface of the cord, was histologically identified as a thrombosed vein. The histological findings were compatible with spinal infarction caused by congestive myelopathy. Whole craniospinal and iliac angiography performed postoperatively failed to reveal any dural and paraspinal vascular malformation. His paraparesis, sensory disturbance, and vesicorectal dysfunction improved significantly after surgery. Congestive myelopathy may be caused by various angiographically occult etiologies other than dural arteriovenous fistula."

In this report, we present an unusual case of a fourth ventricle ependymoma with metastasis to the thoracic spinal cord 19 years after the initial therapy, but without local recurrence. A 37 year-old patient underwent gross total resection of a fourth ventricle ependymoma and postoperative radiation therapy to the posterior fossa. Computed tomography (CT) scanning and/or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed during follow up examinations, conducted annually for ten years after the therapy, revealed no evidence of local tumor recurrence. However, 19 years after the initial treatment, the patient complained of back pain and gait disturbances. MR imaging revealed an intradural extramedullary tumor at the Th2-5 levels. MR imaging of the brain revealed no local tumor recurrence or intracranial tumor dissemination. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology revealed no presence of tumor cells. Total resection of the spinal cord tumor was performed, and the tumor was diagnosed as an ependymoma. We describe the clinical features of this rare lesion and particularly emphasize the need for long-term follow up, for more than ten years after the initial treatment, in patients with fourth ventricle ependymoma."

Under the initial clinical diagnosis of radicular cyst, root canal treatment was performed on the mandibular right second molar. The treatment that continued for six months did not achieve healing. Subsequently surgical intervention was selected since the tooth fracture was found, and the prognosis was judged to be poor. After atraumatic tooth extraction, the apical cystic lesion was enucleated, and the tooth was replanted. A definite diagnosis of orthokeratinized odontogenic cyst was made by histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen. The radiograph taken seven months after the operation showed an improvement in the radiolucent lesion. No clinical signs of tooth mobility, pain, and swelling were present. The tooth was then successfully retained with the final restoration. Careful follow-up is needed in order to detect any signs of recurrence."

Spinal vascular malformations such as intramedullary cavernomas and intradural arteriovenous malformations are the most common cause of atraumatic intramedullary spinal cord hemorrhage based on the existing literature. Additional considerations include warfarin or heparin anticoagulation, hereditary or acquired bleeding disorders, primary spinal cord tumors, spinal cord metastases, Gowers' intrasyringal hemorrhage, or a delayed complication of spinal radiation. Prompt diagnosis of hematomyelia first requires recognition of a myelopathy syndrome (transverse, central, anterior, posterior, or hemi-cord) often accompanied by sudden, severe back or neck pain and sometimes radicular pain. MRI with and without gadolinium is the preferred imaging modality. There are no clinical trials to guide the management of acute intramedullary spinal cord hemorrhage, and subsequent treatment is usually directed toward the underlying cause."

This procedure is most often performed in a percutaneous fashion on an outpatient (or short-stay) basis. Among other indications, the procedure is designated for painful vertebral compression fractures due to primary or metastatic spinal tumors. Published literature favors the use of this procedure in cancer pain management. The overall risk of the procedure is low, although serious complications (including spinal cord compression) can occur.

CD008686,0,19569943,0,Symptomatic osteochondroma of the spine in elderly patients. Report of 3 cases.,"Whereas osteochondroma is a common benign bone tumor in adolescence, it is rarely observed in elderly patients. It is unknown why osteochondromas, which usually develop during skeletal growth, rarely develop in elderly patients. The authors report 3 cases of symptomatic spinal osteochondroma in elderly patients and discuss the possible reasons for the onset of the enlargement of osteochondromas in elderly patients. Clinical history, radiographs, MR images, and CT myelography studies were obtained in each patient and are described. A review of the relevant literature is also presented. In the first case, the cervical osteochondroma caused spinal canal compression and occipital nerve irritation. It was totally excised, which successfully relieved the pain and allowed the patient to return to normal neurological function. In the second case, total removal of the tumor was effective in alleviating clinical symptoms. In the last case, ablation of the articular facet joint partially relieved the patient's lower-back pain. In the first 2 cases, the patients suffered from psoriasis and associated psoriatic arthritis and in the last case, the patient suffered from HIV-associated psoriatic arthritis. The psoriatic arthritis was characterized as asymmetric chronic multiple-joint arthritis and was HLA B27 positive. The pathology of psoriatic arthritis was the accelerating bone turnover and ankylosis. Symptomatic osteochondroma of the spine in elderly patients is extremely rare since it typically develops during skeletal growth. In this report, the authors show that pathological accelerating bone turnover such as psoriatic arthritis may be a possible mechanism for the onset of the enlargement of osteochondromas in elderly patients. The age of the patients in this report suggests that growth of the osteochondroma continues after skeletal development."
CD008686,0,19569548,0,[Modern potentialities of minimally invasive management of chronic non-malignant pain].,"In this retrospective investigation we demonstrated our results of treatment of chronic pain of nonmalignant etiology. The long-term effects of neuromodulation systems were examined in 215 patients with chronic nonmalignant pain syndromes. The mean follow-up period was 4 years. Most of the patients were satisfied with the therapy and have had good pain reduction throughout the follow-up period. In this study we analyzed the indications, selection of patients and the test phase for this kind of therapy. Neuromodulation included spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and intrathecal opioid therapy. We reported about the standards of implantation, the side effects and complications and failures of treatment. Our experience with the long-term administration of spinal opioid medications and SCS for nonmalignant pain encouraged us to use methods of neuromodulation for carefully selected patients. Good results with significant pain reduction demonstrated the consideration this kind of treatment about the conservative therapy."

CD008686,0,19567701,0,"Longitudinal study of intraneural perineurioma--a benign, focal hypertrophic neuropathy of youth.","The natural history of intraneural perineurioma has been inadequately studied. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical presentation, electrophysiologic and imaging features and outcome of intraneural perineurioma. We ask if intraneural perineurioma is a pure motor syndrome that remains confined to one nerve and should be treated by surgical resection. We examined the nerve biopsies of cases labelled perineurioma and selected those with diagnostic features. Thirty-two patients were identified; 16 children and 16 adults; 16 males and 16 females. Median age of onset of neurological symptoms was 14 years (range 0.5-55 years) and median age at evaluation was 17 years (range 2-56 years). All patients had motor deficits; however, mild sensory symptoms or signs were experienced by 27 patients; 'prickling' or 'asleep numbness' in 20, mild pain in 13 and sensory loss in 23. The sciatic nerve or its branches was most commonly affected in 15, followed by brachial plexus, radial nerve and ulnar nerve (four each). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated nerve enlargement (29/32), T1 isointensity (27/32), T2 hyperintensity (25/32) and contrast enhancement (20/20). Diagnoses were made based on targeted biopsy of the focal nerve enlargement identified by imaging. Neurological impairment was of a moderate severity (median Neuropathy Impairment Score was 12 points, range 2-49 points). All patients had focal involvement with 27 involving one nerve and five involving a plexus (one bilateral). Long-term follow-up was possible by telephone interview for 23 patients (median 36 months, range 2-177 months). Twelve patients also had follow-up neurologic evaluation (median 45 months, range 10-247 months). The median Neuropathy Impairment Score had changed from 12.6 to 15.4 points (P = 0.19). In all cases, the distribution of neurologic findings remained unchanged. Median Dyck Disability Score was 3 (range 2-5) indicating a mild impairment without interfering with activities of daily living. Ten patients judged their symptoms unchanged, nine slightly worse and four slightly better. We conclude intraneural perineurioma is a benign hypertrophic (non onion bulb) peripheral nerve tumour that presents insidiously in young people and is motor predominant with mild sensory involvement. It is most often a mononeuropathy, but a plexopathy can occur. Diagnosis of this condition requires clinical suspicion, imaging, targeted fascicular biopsy of the lesion and expertise of nerve pathologists. As these tumours are static or slowly progressive, remain confined to their original distribution and have low morbidity, they probably should not be resected routinely. Because intensive evaluation is needed for diagnosis, intraneural perineurioma is probably under-recognized."

CD008686,0,19556132,0,Percutaneous transpedicular vertebroplasty with polymethyl methacrylate for pathological fracture of the spine.,"We aimed to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of percutaneous transpedicular vertebroplasty (PVP) using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in patients with symptomatic metastatic spine lesions. We included 31 patients in this retrospective study who were treated with PMMA from 2003 to 2005 for intractable pain due to metastatic spine lesions. The types of cancer (and numbers of patients) included: lung cancer (9), breast cancer (7), gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers (5), hepatobiliary malignancies (3), and other types of cancer (7). All patients received vertebroplasty, resulting in 41 treatments (16 in thoracic, 25 in lumbar spine). Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain were measured in all patients. Image studies including contrast-enhanced MRI were performed in all patients. Results showed characteristic metastatic lesions. Suspicious lesions were further confirmed as malignant by a bone scan, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and pathological exam. Vertebroplasty resulted in complete or partial pain relief in 29 patients (95%), and provided no pain relief in 2 patients (5%). The mean preoperative VAS score of 8.9 (+/-0.93) was higher than the mean postoperative VAS score (2.6+/-1.71). Metastatic spine lesions were most common in lung and breast cancer patients and these lesions were located more often on segments T12 to L2 (53.6%). Patients with malignancy of hepatobiliary origin did not show improvement in pain scores as dramatically as patients with other types of malignancies, although only a few cases were included in this study. No patients experienced worsening of symptoms or suffered from vertebroplasty complications. We conclude that vertebroplasty is a safe, effective, and simple treatment for the management of intractable spinal pain due to metastases."

CD008686,0,19553127,0,Giant intradural extramedullary arachnoid cyst of the thoracic spine.,"Spinal intradural arachnoid cysts (ACs) are found frequently in the thoracic region, and often extend over four or five vertebral levels. We present a 28-year-old patient who had a giant thoracic congenital intradural extramedullary AC (T1-T12) with a 10-month history of pain, paresthesia, paraparesis and gait ataxia. A T3 to T6 laminectomy was performed. After durotomy, the posterior wall of the AC was visualized compressing the spinal cord. We resected the cyst wall as widely as possible and connected the cyst to the subarachnoid space using a catheter. There were no postoperative complications. At 1-year follow-up, the patient presented with no motor deficits or pain, and had experienced progressive resolution of the gait ataxia. The treatment of giant intradural extramedullary ACs, especially for those that cannot be totally excised, should include generous fenestration and the insertion of a cyst-subarachnoid shunt."
CD008686,0,19548873,0,A new drug candidate (GEMSP) for multiple sclerosis.,"GEMSP is a mixture of functional polypeptides: fatty acids linked to poly-L-Lysine (PL), antioxidants linked to PL, free radical scavengers linked to PL, and amino acids linked to PL (patent numbers 6114388 (USA) and 792167 (EU)). In this review, we update the data on this new drug reported in the literature. There is evidence suggesting that GEMSP is a good candidate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by focal leukocyte inflammation, demyelization and axonal degeneration, resulting in nerve cell dysfunction. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the main animal model used in the study of MS, a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. EAE has many clinical and histopathological similarities to MS. In this model, preclinical studies on GEMSP have demonstrated that the drug strongly inhibits brain leukocyte infiltration and completely abolishes EAE episodes and clinical scores, and it also appears that GEMSP preserves myelin integrity. In general, treatment with the free constituents of GEMSP (not linked to the inert carrier protein) is poorly active against brain leukocyte infiltration in EAE-immunized animals. This means that free molecules (not linked to PL) exert a very poor action on such infiltration and that these molecules are either rapidly incorporated into the metabolism or are degraded. Moreover, with immunocytochemical techniques, it has been demonstrated that one component of GEMSP, the methionine compound, is stored inside the motoneurons of the ventral horn of the spinal cord. However, this component of GEMSP has not been found in the brain. The new candidate for MS therapy has shown no toxicity either in experimental animals or in humans. An open clinical trial in humans has demonstrated that GEMSP is completely safe. In addition, the approved drugs for the treatment of MS exert marked side effects, but no side effects have been reported following the administration of GEMSP. The results obtained at six months of treatment with low doses of GEMSP (0.75 mg/day) in that open clinical trial in humans were as follows: 55% of the patients maintained a stable expanded disability status scale (EDSS) value and 18% of the patients had a decreased EDSS value instead of a normal progression of 0.25 point on the mean EDSS scale. We focus our review on the following topics: 1) EAE models and clinical evaluation; 2) the synthesis of GEMSP; 3) the effects of GEMSP dosage on EAE; 4) the effects of GEMSP on brain leukocyte infiltration; 5) GEMSP inside motoneurons; 6) the role of the components of GEMSP; and 7) GEMSP in MS patients, GEMSP toxicity, and side effects. In conclusion, all the data reported indicate that GEMSP is a new potential drug candidate for the treatment of MS."

Neurological manifestations of C. neoformans infection include meningitis and, less commonly, parenchymal CNS granulomatous disease. This paper provides detailed clinical descriptions of highly unusual neurological manifestations of cryptococcal nervous system infections. Medical records and diagnostic data including magnetic resonance imaging, histopathology, serology, and CSF analysis were reviewed. A conus medullaris abscess was found in a patient infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A patient with Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis and dermatitis mimicking ophthalmic zoster. An immunocompetent patient presented with recurrent cerebral infarctions in the setting of cryptococcal meningitis.

Limited analgesic efficacy, too many adverse effects.","(1) When oral morphine does not relieve severe pain and when there is no specific treatment for the underlying cause, the first option is to try subcutaneous or intravenous administration. If this standard treatment fails or is poorly tolerated, intrathecal injection is usually preferred as the direct route to the central nervous system. However, one-quarter to one-half of patients still do not achieve adequate pain relief, and adverse effects are relatively frequent; (2) Ziconotide is not an opiate and is not related to the usual classes of drugs that interfere with nervous transmission in the posterior horn of the spinal cord. Marketing authorization has been granted for ""severe, chronic pain in patients who require intrathecal analgesia"". The Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) recommends continuous infusion via an intrathecal catheter connected to a pump; (3) Clinical evaluation of ziconotide does not include any trials versus morphine in patients with nociceptive pain, or any trials versus tricyclic or antiepileptic drugs in patients with neurogenic pain; (4) In a trial in 220 patients in whom systemic morphine had failed, the mean pain score on a 100-mm visual analogue scale was 69.8 mm after three weeks on ziconotide, compared to 75.8 mm with placebo. This difference, although statistically significant, is clinically irrelevant. The proportion of ""responders"" (reduction of at least 30% in the initial pain score) was respectively 16.1% and 12.0% (no statistically significant difference); (5) The two other placebo-controlled trials included 112 patients with pain linked to cancer or HIV infection, and 257 patients with non-cancer pain. After a titration phase lasting 5 to 6 days, a combined analysis of the two trials showed that the mean pain score was 48.8 mm with ziconotide and 68.4 mm with placebo (statistically significant difference). However, many patients did not complete the titration phase. Efficacy also appeared to differ according to the type of pain; ziconotide was more effective on cancer pain than on neurogenic pain; (6) The main adverse effects of ziconotide in clinical trials were cerebellovestibular disorders such as ataxia, dizziness, and gait disorders, as well as confusion, hallucinations (increased in cases of overdose), nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension, and urine retention. About 40% of patients had an elevation in muscle creatine kinase activity, through an unknown mechanism; (7) Intrathecal administration carries a risk of infection (especially meningitis). Some patients might experience a paradoxical increase in pain with ziconotide; (8) In practice, the efficacy of ziconotide in relieving neurogenic pain remains to be established. In cancer pain, the available evidence showing that ziconotide is effective after opiate failure is too weak in view of the potential risks. It is better to re-examine and, if possible, correct the reasons for opiate treatment failure rather than prescribe ziconotide."

CD008686,0,27789982,0,Management of ankylosing spondylitis with infliximab.,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease responsible for back pain, stiffness and progressive loss of functional capacity with limited therapeutic options. Regular physical exercises together with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are the two recognized treatment options in AS. Infliximab is a chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibody that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in the treatment of AS, providing clinical amelioration at both axial and peripheral skeleton. Infliximab also improves quality of life, function, biological parameters (acute phase reactants) and inflammatory lesions of the spine as detected by magnetic resonance imaging. It is given at a 5 mg/kg dosage, as an infusion at weeks 0, 2, 6, and every 6 to 8 weeks after. Open-label and placebo-controlled trials have well demonstrated its high level of efficacy, with an improvement of the disease activity of at least 50% in 60%-80% of patients. In a large placebo-controlled trial, Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis Response Criteria (ASAS20) responders were observed in 61.2% of patients receiving infliximab compared to 19.2% of patients under placebo. Long-term efficacy is maintained when infliximab is administered every 6-8 weeks. Consensus international guidelines for the initiation and the use of this expensive treatment are available. Some questions remain, including the long-term safety, in particular the risk of lymphoma, and the potential influence of infliximab on radiological progression which is not currently demonstrated. Despite these concerns, infliximab has revolutionized the management of AS and represents a considerable therapeutic advancement in this disabling disease."

CD008686,0,19514512,0,[Pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome].,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that is frequently associated with periodic leg movements (PLMS). RLS is generally considered to be a central nervous system (CNS)-related disorder although no specific lesion has been found to be associated with the syndrome. Reduced intracortical inhibition has been demonstrated in RLS by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Some MRI studies have revealed the presence of morphologic changes in the somatosensory cortex, motor cortex and thalamic gray matter. The results of SPECT and PET studies showed that the limbic and opioid systems also play important roles in the pathophysiology of RLS. A functional MRI study revealed abnormal bilateral cerebellar and thalamic activation during the manifestation of sensory symptoms, with additional red nucleus and reticular formation activity during PLMS. PLMS is likely to occur in patients with spinal cord lesions, and some patients with sensory polyneuropathy may exhibit RLS symptoms. RLS symptoms seem to depend on abnormal spinal sensorimotor integration at the spinal cord level and abnormal central somatosensory processing. PLMS appears to depend on increased excitability of the spinal cord and a decreased supraspinal inhibitory mechanism from the All diencephalic dopaminergic system. RLS symptoms respond very dramatically to dopaminergic therapy. The results of analysis by PET and SPECT studies of striatal D2 receptor binding in humans are inconclusive. However, studies in animal models suggest that the participation of the All dopaminergic system and the D3 receptor in RLS symptoms. The symptoms of RLS are aggravated in those with iron deficiency, and iron treatment ameliorates the symptoms in some patients. Neuroimaging studies, analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid, and studies on postmortem tissue and use of animal models have indicated that low brain iron concentrations and dysfunction of iron metabolism and intracellular iron may play key roles in the pathogenesis of RLS. The ""iron-dopamine model"" explains that iron deficiency in the brain causes an abnormality in the dopaminergic system leading to manifestation of RLS. Genetic factors are also important in the development of RLS. A positive family history for RLS has been reported by 40% to 60% of RLS patients. Five loci (RLS 1: 12q, RLS 2: 14q, RLS 3: 9p, RLS 4: 2q, RLS 5: 20p) have been described. Genome-wide association studies have identified variants within the intronic or intergenetic regions of MEIS1 (2p), LBXCOR1/MAP2K5 (15q), BTBD9 (6p), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) (12q) and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type delta (9p) genes. In conclusion, disturbances in the central dopaminergic system, disturbances in iron metabolism, and genetics seem to be the primary factors in the pathophysiology of RLS."
CD008686,0,19514254,0,"[Iliopsoas muscle syndrome. Functional disorders: shortening, spasm and weakness of a structurally unchanged muscle].","Functional (non-organic) disorders of the iliopsoas muscle (IPM), i.e. the shortening, spasm and weakness of the structurally unchanged IPM, can be manifested as abdominal and/or pelvic pain, pain in areas of the thoracolumbar (ThL) and lumbosacral (LS) spine, sacroiliac (SI) joint, hip, groin and anterior thigh on the side of the affected muscle as well as gait disturbances (iliopsoas muscle syndrome). By clinical examination of the IPM, including the transabdominal palpation, stretch and strength tests, pathological masses, shortening, painful spasm, weakness and tendon tenderness of that muscle can be diagnosed. The IPM is, like other postural muscles, inclined to shortening. The weakness of the IPM can be a consequence of the lesion of the lumbar plexus or femoral nerve that innervate the IPM, as well as a consequence of certain organic diseases of the IPM. Painful stimuli coming from somatic and visceral structures that are innervated from Th12-L4 nerve roots, from which the IPM segmental innervation also originates, can cause a reflex spasm of the IPM. A painful spasm of the IPM caused by disorders of the ThL and LS spine, SI and hip joint, can mimic diseases of the abdominal and pelvic organs. In the differential diagnosis of the IPM painful spasm, organic diseases of that muscle should be considered foremost (abscess, hematoma, tumor, metastase), as they can result in spasm, and the diseases of the abdominal and pelvic organs that can cause an IPM reflex spasm. The IPM functional disorders, which are not rare, are often overlooked during a clinical examination of a patient. Reasons for overlooking these disorders are: 1) a nonspecific and variable clinical picture presenting the IPM functional disorders, 2) the IPM functional disorders are a neglected source of pain, 3) the inaccessibility of the IPM for inspection, 4) the lack of knowledge of the IPM examination techniques and 5) the IPM functional disorders cannot be discovered by radiological examinations of the abdomen. From a therapeutic point of view, it is important to recognise the IPM functional disorders since these disorders respond very well to appropriate therapy. Etiopathogenesis, clinical picture, diagnosis, differential diagnosis and therapy of the IPM functional disorders are described in the article."

CD008686,0,19504131,0,Value of MRI imaging prior to a kyphoplasty for osteoporotic insufficiency fractures.,"Previous studies have shown the safety and effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). MRI and particularly the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence are very sensitive for detecting vertebral edema as a result of fresh fractures or micro-fractures. Therefore, it has a great therapeutic relevance in differentiating vertebral deformities seen by conventional X-ray and CT scans. Although an MRI scan is expensive, to my knowledge no study has evaluated the benefits of preoperative MRI in evaluating a therapeutic plan for kyphoplasty. This is a prospective study evaluating the benefit of a preoperative MRI scan regarding changes of kyphoplasty therapy. Twenty-eight patients were included in this study. Twenty-four patients were treated by balloon kyphoplasty, in a total of 40 vertebral bodies. The mean age was 73 years. All patients suffered from OVCFs. As a first step, all patients got a CT scan. The individual therapeutic plan was then defined by the patients' history, complaints and the results of the CT scan. As far as all criteria for kyphoplasty were fulfilled, an MRI examination including the STIR sequences was performed preoperatively. The number of times a change was made in therapy as a result from the additional information from the MRI was then evaluated. By performing a preoperatively MRI examination, the therapy plan was changed in 16 out of 28 (57%) patients. Eight patients underwent additional levels of kyphoplasty at the same procedure. In five patients, lesions were found to be old fractures and therefore were not treated operatively. Two of these patients received no kyphoplasty at all. Another patient only a part of the originally intended levels was treated. The other two cases received a kyphoplasty at different vertebral levels, as these vertebral bodies showed signs of an acute fracture in the MRI scan. Additionally, an incidental diagnosis of carcinoma of the kidney was made in two patients. Kyphoplasty was deferred and they were referred for further evaluation. One patient was found to have an aortic aneurysm. Kyphoplasty was performed and after that the patient was referred in order to treat the aneurysm. This study confirms the diagnostic benefits of an MRI scan before performing a kyphoplasty. For 16 out of 28 patients, the therapeutic plan was changed because of the information obtained by preoperative MRI. Preoperative MRI helped to generate the correct surgical strategy, by demonstrating the correct location of injury and by detecting concomitant diseases."

CD008686,0,19487983,0,Association of mitochondrial allele 4216C with increased risk for sepsis-related organ dysfunction and shock after burn injury.,"Impaired mitochondrial activity has been linked to increased risk for clinical complications after injury. Furthermore, variant mitochondrial alleles have been identified and are thought to result in decreased mitochondrial activity. These include a nonsynonymous mitochondrial polymorphism (T4216C) in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase 1 gene (ND1), encoding a key member of complex I within the electron transport chain, which is found almost exclusively among Caucasians. We hypothesized that burn patients carrying ND1 4216C are less able to generate the cellular energy necessary for an effective immune response and are at increased risk for infectious complications. The association between 4216C and outcome after burn injury was evaluated in a cohort of 175 Caucasian patients admitted to the Parkland Hospital with burns covering greater than or equal to 15% of their total body surface area or greater than or equal to 5% full-thickness burns under an institutional review board-approved protocol. To remove confounding unrelated to burn injury, individuals were excluded if they presented with significant non-burn-related trauma (Injury Severity Score > or =16), traumatic or anoxic brain injury, spinal cord injury, were HIV/AIDS positive, had active malignancy, or survived less than 48 h postadmission. Within this cohort of patients, carriage of the 4216C allele was significantly associated by unadjusted analysis with increased risk for sepsis-related organ dysfunction or septic shock (P = 0.011). After adjustment for full-thickness burn size, inhalation injury, age, and sex, carriage of the 4216C allele was associated with complicated sepsis (adjusted odds ratio = 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-9.1; P = 0.005), relative to carriers of the T allele."
CD008686,0,19485254,0,[Osteoarticular pains as early manifestation of malignancies in children].,"Based on the rewiew of the literature and own clinical observations, we presented examples of the most common pediatric onco-hematologic malignancies, that are manifested early by osteoarticular complaints. When these complaints predominate in the clinical presentation, they lead the diagnosis towards nonmalignant conditions, that are most common cause of such symptoms in children, like injuries, nonspecific reactive arthritis or inflammatory connective tissue diseases. However, in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the most prevalent childhood malignancy, bone and joint pains are present early in 40-60% of cases and they frequently anticipate any abnormalities in complete blood counts. Findings reported in the literature and own observations indicate that these complaints correlate with: lower white cell counts, lower percentage of blast cells in the peripheral blood and lower incidence of organomegaly - that may delay the decision of bone marrow aspiration. In our study we have also presented 4 cases of other malignancies in children, who were complaining of the osteoarticular pains, that limited they activity, long time before the beginning of treatment in Department of Oncology and Pediatric Hematology of University's Pediatric Hospital in Cracow. Long-lasting and intensive osteoarticular complains, that restraint normal activity and do not resolve during rest, spinal compression symptoms, coexisting adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, change of behaviour, unexplicained fever must be recognized as specific ""red flags"". Oncologic vigilance must be inspired by discreet hematological abnormalites (like increased anemia, lower white cell counts with lymphocytosis, mild thrombocytopenia) -that indicate bone marrow infiltration, as well as high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, accompanied by moderately elevated C-reactive protein - characteristic for malignancy. Basic and commonly accessible radiological imaging may provide valuable information, because it can reveal tumors, osteolytic lesions or destruction of bone architecture. Laboratory tests of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and uric acid level, often raised in malignancies are also helpful. The aim of this study was to focus the attention of pediatricians to the necessity of including malignancy in the differential diagnosis of intensive or unexplained osteoarticular complaints."

CD008686,0,19475421,0,Clinical practice: the spine from birth to adolescence.,"The spine in children can be affected by different bone pathologies such as trauma, infection, and tumoral processes. Most typical however are postural deformities, of which the evolution is mainly influenced by growth. An overview will be given of the most frequent problems encountered in children. Back pain is not infrequent and should always be taken seriously. In recent years, however, there has been an increase in functional complaints, mainly due to stress-related problems. Improving imaging techniques allows more and more accurate diagnoses and should be used judiciously. Postural deformities should be divided into functional and structural entities. Functional hyperkyphosis, hyperlordosis, and scoliosis should be identified by a thorough clinical evaluation and certainly not be overtreated. A structural scoliosis has the most potential of creating cardiovascular or pain problems in later life. Not all curves however have a bad prognosis. It is the task of the clinician to identify the children needing special attention, based on their knowledge of the underlying pathology as in congenital scoliosis and of the physiological age or maturity of the child, especially in the adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Treatment should be initiated according to the prognosis regardless of the age of the child."
CD008686,0,19472953,0,Secondary aneurysmal bone cyst in fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur.,"Fibrous dysplasia of bone is a congenital skeletal disorder characterized by proliferation of spindle cells inside an intramedullary collagenous stroma and by formation of metaplastic bone. An aneurysmal bone cyst is a lesion of unknown etiology. Macroscopically it appears like a blood-filled cavity that expands the affected bone. Histologically, fibrous septa are bordered by macrophages, giant cells, inflammatory cells, and areas of bone production. Hemorrhagic areas can rise into fibrous dysplasia. The lesion appears as an aggressive and destructive process that is difficult to diagnose properly. A 29-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of left inguinal and lumbar pain. She reported increased pain after physical activity. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left femur (without intravenous gadolinium) showed a mass extending 14 cm along the femoral metaphysis. This lesion involved cortical bone that was broken in the posteromedial site. Computed tomography confirmed the osteostructural lytic alteration that ""blows up"" the proximal femur metaphysis. A trochar biopsy allowed the diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst on fibrous dysplasia, excluding malignancy. The lesion was treated with curettage and local adjuvants and filled with bone grafts. Internal fixation with a sliding screw plate was also performed. Radiographs at 1 year postoperatively showed good consolidation of the grafts and absence of local recurrence. The patient achieved active and passive mobilization of the left hip with no pain."

CD008686,0,19471276,0,Suspected malignant cord compression - improving time to diagnosis via a 'hotline': a prospective audit.,"The aim of the study was to achieve earlier diagnosis of malignant cord compression (MCC) using urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for selected patients. A comparison was carried out of the current prospective audit of 100 patients referred by a general practitioner or a consultant over 32 months with both a previous national Clinical Research and Audit Group (CRAG) prospective audit (324 cases of MCC) and an earlier retrospective audit of 104 patients referred with suspected MCC. A telephone hotline rapid-referral process for patients with known malignancy and new symptoms (severe nerve root pain +/- severe back pain) was designed. Patients were considered for urgent MRI after discussion with a senior clinician responsible for the hotline. Appropriate referrals were discussed with radiology and oncology ensuring timely MRI reporting and intervention. The main outcome measures are as follows: time from referral to diagnosis; time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis; and mobility at diagnosis. A total of 50 patients (52%) of those scanned had either MCC (44) or malignant nerve root compression (6) compared with the earlier rate of 23 out of 104 patients (22%). Ten out of 44 MCC patients (23%) were paralysed at diagnosis, compared with 149 out of 324 (46%) in the CRAG audit. Time from reporting pain to diagnosis was 32 days compared with 89 days in the CRAG audit. Median time from referral to diagnosis was 1 day, again considerably shorter than the CRAG audit time of 15 days (interquartile (IQ) range: 3-66). In patients at risk of MCC, fast-track referral with rapid access to MRI reduces time between symptom onset and diagnosis, improves mobility at diagnosis and reduces the number of negative MRI scans."
CD008686,0,19468872,0,Lumbar spondylosis: clinical presentation and treatment approaches.,"Low back pain (LBP) affects approximately 60-85% of adults during some point in their lives. Fortunately, for the large majority of individuals, symptoms are mild and transient, with 90% subsiding within 6 weeks. Chronic low back pain, defined as pain symptoms persisting beyond 3 months, affects an estimated 15-45% of the population. For the minority with intractable symptoms, the impact on quality of life and economic implications are considerable. Despite the high prevalence of low back pain within the general population, the diagnostic approach and therapeutic options are diverse and often inconsistent, resulting in rising costs and variability in management throughout the country. In part, this is due to the difficulty establishing a clear etiology for most patients, with known nociceptive pain generators identified throughout the axial spine. Back pain has been termed as ""an illness in search of a disease."" Indeed, once ""red flag"" diagnoses such as cancer and fracture have been ruled out, the differential sources of low back pain remain broad, including the extensive realm of degenerative changes within the axial spine for which radiological evaluation is nonspecific and causal relationships are tentative. We will elaborate on these degenerative processes and their clinical implications. We will further discuss diagnostic approaches and the efficacy of existing treatment options."
CD008686,0,19461836,0,Opioid induced hyperalgesia: clinical implications for the pain practitioner.,"Opioids have been and continue to be used for the treatment of chronic pain. Evidence supports the notion that opioids can be safely administered in patients with chronic pain without the development of addiction or chemical dependency. However, over the past several years, concerns have arisen with respect to administration of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain, particularly non-cancer pain. Many of these involve legal issues with respect to diversion and prescription opioid abuse. Amongst these, opioid induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is becoming more prevalent as the population receiving opioids for chronic pain increases. OIH is a recognized complication of opioid therapy. It is a pro-nocioceptive process which is related to, but different from, tolerance. This focused review will elaborate on the neurobiological mechanisms of OIH as well as summarize the pre-clinical and clinical studies supporting the existence of OIH. In particular, the role of the excitatory neurotransmitter, N-methyl-D-aspartate appears to play a central, but not the only, role in OIH. Other mechanisms of OIH include the role of spinal dynorphins and descending facilitation from the rostral ventromedial medulla. The links between pain, tolerance, and OIH will be discussed with respect to their common neurobiology. Practical considerations for diagnosis and treatment for OIH will be discussed. It is crucial for the pain specialist to differentiate amongst clinically worsening pain, tolerance, and OIH since the treatment of these conditions differ. Tolerance is a necessary condition for OIH but the converse is not necessarily true. Office-based detoxification, reduction of opioid dose, opioid rotation, and the use of specific NMDA receptor antagonists are all viable treatment options for OIH. The role of sublingual buprenorphine appears to be an attractive, simple option for the treatment of OIH and is particularly advantageous for a busy interventional pain practice."

CD008686,0,19449145,0,Comparative study on low back pain misdiagnosed as spondyloarthropathy.,"This study aims to investigate features of different diseases with low back pain misdiagnosed as spondyloarthropathy so as to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for spondyloarthropathy. The clinical and laboratory data of 24 cases misdiagnosed as spondyloarthropathy in recent 3 years were comparatively and retrospectively analyzed. The diagnostic accuracy of the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) criteria, Amor criteria, and the combination of them in these misdiagnosed cases was also analyzed. The final diagnoses of these 24 cases were listed below: four malignant tumors (retroperitoneal adipose sarcoma, advanced gastric carcinoma, ovarian papillary epithelioma, acute lymphocytic leukemia), six benign tumors (two parathyroid adenoma with hyperparathyroidism, one intraspinal lipoma, intraspinal ependymomas, sacral tubulocyst, and intraspinal schwannoglioma, respectively). The other 14 cases included fibromyalgia syndrome (3), osteitis condensans (3), diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (2), lumbar intervertebral disk protrusion (1), congenital scoliosis (1), Wilson's disease (1), ochronosis (1), Fanconi syndrome (1) and hypophosphatemic rachiopathy (1). Among patients with tumor, all except three patients had persistent low back pain without morning stiffness, which aggravated at night and could not be relieved by rest or exercise. The symptoms could not be relieved by administration of multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Eleven patients had inflammatory low back pain defined by Calin. Of the total misdiagnosed cases, 54.17-83.33% could be prevented by application of ESSG criteria or Amor criteria, or a combination of them. From the data, we could see that the clinical features of different diseases with low back pain were different from each other and from those of spondyloarthropathy. The various criteria for spondyloarthropathy may be more effective in combination, along with other clinical information like these clinical features."
CD008686,0,19442446,0,Transdermal fentanyl in cachectic cancer patients.,"Fentanyl is an opioid with high lipid solubility, suitable for intravenous, spinal, transmucosal and transdermal administration. The transdermal fentanyl patch has become widely used in the treatment of both malignant and non-malignant chronic pain. The absorption of fentanyl from the patch is governed by the surface area of the patch, by skin permeability and by local blood flow. The aim of this study is to find out whether absorption of fentanyl in cachectic patients with cancer-related pain is different from that of normal weight cancer patients. We recruited ten normal weight (mean body mass index (BMI) 23 kg/m(2)) and ten cachectic (mean BMI 16 kg/m(2)) cancer pain patients. A transdermal fentanyl patch with a dose approximately equianalgesic to the patients' previous opioid dose was administered to the upper arm of the patient for 3 days. Prior to patch application, the height, weight and BMI of the patient, as well as upper arm skin temperature, local sweating, thickness of skin fold and local blood flow were measured. Plasma fentanyl concentrations were analyzed from blood samples taken at baseline, 4, 24, 48 and 72 h. Plasma fentanyl concentrations adjusted to dose were significantly lower at 48 and 72 h in cachectic patients than normal weight patients. The cachectic patients had a significantly thinner upper arm skin fold, but no differences were found in local blood flow, sweating, or skin temperature. Absorption of transdermal fentanyl is impaired in cachectic patients compared with that of normal weight cancer pain patients."
CD008686,0,19439840,0,Transverse myelitis spectrum disorders.,"Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder that affects the spinal cord focally resulting in motor sensory and autonomic dysfunction. Establishing the diagnosis of ATM is not as difficult as determining the possible etiology. There is a difference in the perception of ATM seen in the West as compared to developing countries. In the West multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system. An attack of ATM may be the beginning of MS. However, this may not be the case in developing countries where MS is uncommon. Most often transverse myelitis is monophasic and at best represents a site-restricted form of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Traditionally the combination of optic neuritis and ATM, occurring as a monophasic illness would have been called as neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Changing concepts in the definition of NMO and the discovery of a biomarker, neuromyelitis optica immunoglobulin (NMO_IgG), has changed the way relapsing autoimmune disorders are being perceived currently. A variety of idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as Japanese form of optic spinal MS, recurrent myelitis, and recurrent optic neuritis have been brought under the umbrella of neuromyelitis spectrum disorders because of the association with NMO-IgG. Complete transverse myelitis accompanied by longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis which is seronegative for this biomarker has also been reported from several countries including Japan, Australia, and India. Thus, ATM is a heterogeneous disorder with a varied clinical spectrum, etiology, and outcome."

CD008686,0,19437045,0,A minimally invasive surgical treatment possibility of osteolytic vertebral collapse in multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B cell malignancy characterized by important alterations of physiologic bone turnover, wherein increased osteoclastic bone resorption is not accompanied by a comparable increase in bone formation, resulting in diffuse osteopenia, focal lytic lesions, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and bony pain. Consequently, patients with MM frequently require for quality of life's improvement and pain's treatment radiation therapy, surgery, and analgesic medication. Minimally invasive surgical procedures such as the kyphoplasty allows patients with pathological osteolytic vertebral lesions to have immediate improvement in their quality of life. This surgical technique provides in myeloma vertebral collapses same quick pain relief as in osteoporotic vertebral fractures, and a minor morphological restoration of the interested vertebra, but sufficient to restore sagittal alignment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the functional and morphological results of kyphoplasty for the treatment of vertebral osteolysis due to MM. We report a retrospective study in 30 such patients (45 vertebral lesions) who were evaluated before and after kyphoplasty, with regard to pain, general condition, quality of life, use of analgesics, by means of evaluation forms: Short-Form-36, Visual Analog Scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and with regard to percentage height restored and reduction of segmental kyphosis. Marked clinical improvement was observed in all patients during the first 12 postoperative months, with gradual a little worsening thereafter from deterioration of their general condition to 60-month follow-up. The restoration of vertebral body mean height was maintained to 5 years clinical and radiographic control. Segmental kyphosis angle correction showed a mean decrease of 1.7 degrees (range 0 degrees -2.5 degrees ) at radiographic control at 5-year follow-up, with respect to the immediate postoperative X-ray, although lower than preoperative. The data obtained demonstrated the effectiveness of kyphoplasty in the treatment of vertebral collapse in MM. The results achieved with this minimally invasive technique were clinically and biomechanically satisfactory."

A prospective non-randomised study on 154 patients.,"In a prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the potential use of kyphoplasty (KP) and vertebroplasty (VP) as complementary techniques in the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). After 1 month of conservative treatment for VCFs, patients with intractable pain were offered treatment with KP or VP according to a treatment algorithm that considers time from fracture (Delta t) and amount of vertebral body collapse. Bone biopsy was obtained intra-operatively to exclude patients affected by malignancy or osteomalacia. 164 patients were included according to the above criteria. Mean age was 67.6 years. Mean follow-up was 33 months. 10 patients (6.1%) were lost to follow-up and 154 reached the minimum 2-year follow-up. 118 (69.5%) underwent VP and 36 (30.5%) underwent KP. Complications affected five patients treated with VP, whose one suffered a transient intercostal neuropathy and four a subsequent VCF (two at adjacent level). Results in terms of visual analogue scale and Oswestry scores were not different among treatment groups. In conclusion, at an average follow-up of almost 3 years from surgical treatment of osteoporotic VCFs, VP and KP show similar good clinical outcomes and appear to be complementary techniques with specific different indications."

CD008686,0,19404690,0,Cervical fixation in the pediatric patient: our experience.,"The surgical management of cervical instability in children is a challenging issue. Although the indications for internal fixation are similar to those for adults, accurate pre-surgery study and sharp surgical techniques are necessary because of the size of such patients' anatomy, their peculiar tissue biology and the wide spectrum of diseases requiring cervical fusion. Our case study is made up of 31 patients, 15 male and 16 female, with an average age of 7 years and 6 months (2 years and 6 months to 18 years) who underwent cervical fusion for instability. Their physical condition presented various different pathologies ranging from congenital deformity, systemic skeletal disease, tumors, trauma, post-surgery instability. We performed occipito-cervical fusion in 11 cases, 5 of which involved stabilization at the cranium-vertebral junction. We used instrumentation in 13 cases (3 sublaminar wiring, 10 rigid adult instrumentation). We used rigid adult instrumentation in three patients under 10 years of age, treated by rod, occipital screws and sublaminar hook instrumentation in steel C0-C2 (9-year-old male, affected by os odontoideum in Down's syndrome; male of 7 years and 10 months, affected by os odontoideum in Down's syndrome; female of 4 years and 6 months with occipito-cervical stenosis and C0-C2 instability in Hurler's syndrome). We operated on two patients under 3 years of age, using sublaminar wiring with bone precursors and allograft at level C0-C2 (one of these was a 30-month-old male with post-traumatic instability C0-C2, while the other was a 17-month-old male with C0-C2 instability in Larsen's syndrome). The average follow-up age was 7 years and 1 month (between 1 and 18 years). Cervical fusion was assessed by X-ray examinations at 4th and 12th weeks and at 6th and 12th months after surgery. Where implants could allow, RMN examination was performed at 1st month after surgery. In the other cases, in which implants do not allow RMN to be performed, CT scan and standard X-rays were carried out, and new X-rays were performed every other year. We experienced two cases of sublaminar wiring rupture without impairment of bone fusion. No patient suffered major complications (infection and osteomyelitis, rigid instrumentation mobilization, incomplete fusion with instability, neurologic impairment, insufficient cervical spine range of movement to cope with everyday life activities, cervical pain). Even though most authors still indicate that rigid instrumentation should be performed in cases over 10 years of age and sublaminar wiring in cases over 3 years of age, our findings demonstrate that this age limit can be lowered. We have treated children under 10 years of age by rigid adult instrumentation and under 36 months of age by wiring. The anatomic size of the patient is the most important factor in determining the use of instrument arthrodesis to treat pediatric cervical spine instability. Although not easy, it is possible and preferable in many cases to adapt fixation to child cervical spine even in very young patients."

CD008686,0,19399534,0,Relevance of the cranioaxial angle in the occipitocervical stabilization using an original construct: a retrospective study on 50 patients.,"We present a retrospective study on a series composed of 50 patients, treated between 1992 and 2006, affected by pathologies of the craniocervical junction. All the patients were treated using an innovative procedure based on a cranial claw made up of low profile hooks, conceived by one of the authors. Advantages of this technique are, to our point of view, a higher resistance to cranial hooks dislodgment, when compared with screw fixation instrumentation, especially in pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis that leads to a qualitative deterioration of the bone stock and to the reduction of the occipital wall thickness. Occipitoaxial alignment was assessed radiographically using the McGregor line. We observed an improvement in the subjective evaluation of pain in all treated patients with a 46% improvement from the initial values. Moreover, patient stabilized with an occipitoaxial angle included in the physiological range showed better results either for the survival of the instrumentation or the onset of junctional pathology. Patients have been followed up afterwards and evaluated by the visual analogue scale for the assessment of pain and by the Nurick scale for the cases associated with myelopathy. We believe that cranial anchorage with a hook claw allows for an instrumentation provided with high stability, particularly useful in revision surgery and major instabilities. The study of the occipitoaxial angles showed that the better results and the long-lasting stability of the implant are correlated to a fusion angle included in the physiological range."

All patients presented with a one-to-3-month history of back pain or numbness in the legs, and sudden neurological deterioration. One also developed cauda equina syndrome and another developed radiculopathy. In all cases, magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass with high signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Facet arthrography and computed tomography revealed communication between the mass and the neighbouring facet joint. The haematomas were removed en bloc with the ligamentum flavum. They were surrounded by the ligament and contained degenerated and lacerated elastic fibres but no synovial lining cells. Facet cyst haematoma is so-named because of bleeding from tissue adjacent to the facet joint into a pre-existing facet cyst."

CD008686,0,19389491,0,Acute transverse myelitis: a practical reappraisal.,"Acute transverse myelitis (ATM), a subgroup of various conditions that cause transverse spinal cord syndromes, is an inflammatory and usually idiopathic spinal cord disease. Idiopathic ATM is diagnosed according to established criteria which mainly assure a clinical picture of bilateral symptoms and signs attributable to spinal cord disease, existence of focal cord inflammation by magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies, and exclusion of many diseases, especially cord compression and ""disease-associated ATM"", as Sjögren disease. Patients with idiopathic ATM have motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunctions with acute or subacute onset, progressing to nadir in 4 h to 21 days, with full or partial recovery in most cases. Emergent treatment to halt inflammation with corticosteroids is required as well as early appropriate symptomatic therapies.

It has been reported that some antidepressants are effective for treating neuropathic pain. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We have recently demonstrated that blocking P2X4 receptors in the spinal cord reverses tactile allodynia after peripheral nerve injury in rats, implying that P2X4 receptors are a key molecule in neuropathic pain.

Fourteen cases were identified, consisting of one os odontoideum; four acute fractures and four non-unions of the odontoid; three tumors and two complex fractures of C2 vertebral body, and one C2-C3 post-traumatic instability. One misplaced screw without clinical consequences was the only complication recorded. Screw loosening or migration was not observed at follow-up, showing a stable fixation."

CD008686,0,19341181,0,Myelitis in the course of systemic lupus erythematosus: review.,"Myelopathy manifested clinically as acute longitudinal or transverse myelitis constitutes one of the most severe and rare neuropsychiatric manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (1-3% of patients). Myelitis has been observed less commonly in other connective tissue diseases, mostly in antiphospholipid syndrome, and rarely in Sjögren's syndrome, Behçet's disease and mixed connective tissue disease. Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) may also be present in diseases of various etiology, including multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, infectious diseases and malignancies. Myelitis in SLE is manifested as a dramatic spinal cord injury leading to paralysis or muscular paresis, sensory deficits, and smooth muscle dysfunction usually in the form of sphincter dysfunction. The imaging technique of choice in case of suspected ATM is magnetic resonance imaging with intravenous contrast agent (gadolinium diethylenetriamine-pentaacid). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination in patients with ATM in the course of SLE indicate usually pleocytosis with prevalence of granulocytes, increased protein levels, low glucose levels, significantly hindering differential diagnosis in the early stage of the disease. Observations made by the authors (2 female patients with SLE) show that antibodies specific to SLE can be found in the CSF collected in the acute phase of myelitis. These observations have not yet been confirmed by other researchers. Early introduction of intravenous immunosuppression with large doses of cyclophosphamide and glucocorticosteroids improves the long-term prognosis. Other therapeutic approaches have been also used in more severe cases. Even with appropriate therapy, prognosis in this disease is uncertain."

CD008686,0,19303342,0,Late Mycobacterium bovis spondylitis after intravesical BCG therapy.,"A 72-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of low back and leg pain. Past medical history revealed transurethral resection of bladder cancer followed by multiple intravesical BCG instillation 12 years ago. Imaging studies of the thoracolumbar spine showed osteolysis of the L3 and L4 vertebrae and the associated intervertebral disc space, and a large soft tissue mass with signal abnormalities suggesting of an abscess. CT-guided needle biopsy showed Mycobacterium bovis infection. A triple anti-tuberculous chemotherapy regimen including isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol was administered for 12 months. Surgical treatment included drainage of the abscess and L2-L5 spinal instrumentation and fusion. Intravesical BCG therapy may be complicated by late disseminated disease to the bone even many years after initial BCG therapy. Patients having BCG therapy should be closely evaluated thereafter for the possibility of hematogenous spread of mycobacteria to distant sites."
CD008686,0,19303302,0,Microsurgical treatment and functional outcomes of multi-segment intramedullary spinal cord tumors.,"We aimed to prospectively analyze correlations between clinical features and histological classification of multi-segment intramedullary spinal cord tumors (MSICTs), and the extent of microsurgical resection and functional outcomes. Fifty-six patients with MSICTs underwent microsurgery for tumor removal using a posterior approach. The tumor was exposed through a dorsal myelotomy. Pre-operative and post-operative nervous function was scored using the Improved Japanese Orthopaedic Association (IJOA) grading system. Correlation analyses were performed between functional outcome (IJOA score) and histological features, age, tumor location, and the longitudinal extent of spinal cord involvement. The most frequently involved levels were the medullo cervical and the cervicothoracic regions (51.8%, 29/56) followed by the conus terminalis (26.8%, 15/56) and the thoracic region (14.3%, 8/56). Ependymoma was the most frequent MSICT type, seen in 22 of 56 patients (39%), followed by low grade astrocytoma (17 patients, 30%) and glioblastoma multiforme (3 patients, 5%). Gross total tumor removal was achieved in 33 cases (58%), subtotal resection in 4 (7%), and partial resection in 16 (28%). The histological classification of the tumor was the most important factor influencing the extent of surgical removal (chi2=22.17, p=0.00). The overall difference between pre-operative and post-operative neurological state was not significant (chi2=5.44, p=0.61). Thus, MSICTs were most commonly seen in the medullo cervical and cervicothoracic regions, with ependymoma and low grade astrocytoma the most common tumour types. We stress the importance of early microsurgical treatment for MSICTs while the patients do not have severe dysfunction."
CD008686,0,19301786,0,Osteochondroma in the lumbar intraspinal canal causing nerve root compression.,"Osteochondromas, which are benign bone tumors that usually develop on long bones, tubular bones, are rarely found in the spine. If they are located in the spinal canal, they may cause nerve root or spinal cord compression, which is a rare but potentially catastrophic manifestation of osteochondromas. In this article, we report a case of a 38-year-old man who presented with low back pain, paresthesia, and weakness of the right lower extremity aggravating gradually for 5 months. No family history of this disease can be traced. The L4-L5 level computed tomography scan showed an abnormal bony protrusion arising from the right interior wall of L5 right lamina toward the intraspinal canal. The protrusion compressed the L5 nerve root severely. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the same level revealed that the L5 nerve root and spinal dura mater were notably compressed by the intraspinal extradural exostosis attached to the right lamina of L5. Considering differential diagnosis, lumbar facet synovial cysts must be excluded as they can also cause myeloradiculopathy with the similar mechanism. The tumor, approximately 6x7x11 mm, was identified after laminectomy of the L5 laminae. Postoperative histopathologic examination confirmed our hypothesis of benign osteochondroma. Postoperatively, the patient recovered rapidly in neurological function and was free of symptoms. Surgery is essential to this rare case. Computed tomography and MRI are helpful for the preoperatively precise indication of tumor extent and its relationships with the adjacent."

The images revealed peripherally increased FDG activity in the left lower lung mass. In addition, there was intense FDG activity in 2 adjacent thoracic vertebrae on PET images corresponding to the regions of bone destruction on the concurrent CT. Therefore, a possible diagnosis of lung carcinoma with bone metastases was suggested. However, subsequent tests demonstrated that the left lung mass was in fact a lung sequestration, whereas the spinal lesions were due to Pott disease (tuberculous spondylitis)."

Her past medical history included stage IV melanoma for which she underwent an excision from the right flank area 25 years ago. She was cleared from any disease 5 years after the excision. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine revealed increased signal intensity in the C7 vertebral body with soft tissue extension into the epidural space. Two weeks after initial presentation the patient underwent a C7 corpectomy and fusion. The C7 vertebral body was grossly pathologic and tissue samples revealed metastatic malignant melanoma. During the 2 weeks following the fusion the patient developed increasing pain and generalized weakness. Repeat MRI of the cervical spine revealed a large soft tissue intensity extending in the spinal canal from C6 to T2. Several days later the patient developed an acute onset of lower extremity weakness as well as urinary incontinence. The patient opted to pursue hospice care, and she died 3 weeks later, 8 weeks after the initial presentation."

In approximative 50% of the cases of bones hydatidosis, the cysts are localized at spines vertebrae, broad bones and mandible. We present a case of a 38 years old female. The patient related an insidious beginning of symptoms, about 3-4 years before, with anterior chest pain, and 3-4 month before hospitalization, the presence of a sternal tumor, in upper portion of the bone. Clinical examination of the patient showed a sternal tumor, at manubrium, painful at palpation, increased consistency, with local inflammation signs. Also, the patient related pain at sterno-clavicular articulation, increased by left upper limb motions, but without mobility restriction. Biochemical analysis revealed an moderate inflammatory syndrome: blood cell sedimentation speed = 40 mm/h, WBC = 9600/mmc, E = 3%, Hb = 11.8g/100ml, alcaline and acid phosphatase - normal range. Thoracic scan: sternal tumor at manubrium with invasion at sternoclavicular joint and bone destruction. Intraoperative we discovered that the sternal tumor was in fact an hydatic cysts, confirmed by the anatomo-pathological exam; we performed cysts removal and resection of osteitic bone. Postoperative outcome was favorable, with antiparasitic treatment after surgery; no recurrence of the hydatic disease or secondary localization."

This article aims to review the interventional options for non-cancer pain. Multiple searches using Medline were carried out and additional searches were made using reference lists of published papers and book chapters. The article discussed procedures ranging from selective nerve root or zygapophyseal (facet) joint block with local anaesthetics to irreversible neurodestruction with radiofrequency energy or neurolytic agents and neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation. Other techniques include intraspinal delivery of analgesics. There is evidence that these interventional procedures are valuable both diagnostically and therapeutically.
CD008686,0,19268050,0,[Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty--treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures].,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The surgical treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body fractures is associated with many complications. Vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) are minimally invasive procedures allowing us to strengthen the vertebral body and thus stabilize it. The aim of this non-randomized study is to evaluate a group of patients treated by VP and KP procedures and to discuss related risks. MATERIAL Between September 2005 and October 2007, a total of 32 patients (37 vertebrae) were treated by the VP and KP techniques. Vertebroplasty was used in 21 and kyphoplasty in 11 patients. In this initial group, four patients were excluded from evaluation because of a tumour aetiology of the fracture. The remaining 28 patients who had an osteoporotic vertebral body fracture verified by CT scan findings were followed up and evaluated. METHODS The evaluation was based on modified Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores recorded at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Cement leakage detected by X-ray was assessed by means of the classification used by Yeom et al. and, at the same time, the occurrence of adjacent vertebral fracture, if any, was detected by 1 year after surgery. RESULTS Radiographic cement leakage was found in eight patients (21.6%), with clinical manifestation in two (5.4%). One had an incomplete motor lesion due to cement leakage into the spinal column, and the other had pulmonary embolism due to cement leakage into the mediastinum. The whole group showed marked improvement in clinical condition, as assessed by the ODI. When expressed as per cent, the average ODI was 57% pre- and 15.7 % post-operatively. All patients reported pain relief in the affected spine. The average VAS score of 8.1 pre-operatively decreased to an average of 2.6 post-operatively. There were no radiographic findings of adjacent vertebral body fracture. DISCUSSION Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are currently used to treat osteoporotic vertebral fracture. Their advantages include an immediate stabilization of the vertebra by cement solidification, possibility of percutaneous application under local anaesthesia, and early patient mobilization without any external fixation. However, when evaluating these techniques, safety of the surgical procedure should be taken into consideration. The most frequent risk is cement leakage. CONCLUSIONS Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty can, under strict adherence to the operative protocol, be an effective approach to the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body fracture. It permits early mobilization of the patient without the necessity of external fixation. Key words: vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, osteoporotic spine fracture, osteoporosis."

Spinal tumors in children are a rare and heterogeneous condition that frequently are diagnosed late because of their uncharacteristic clinical picture. Symptoms are usually limited to diffuse back pain or spinal deformities, prior to leg paresis or sphincter dysfunction. Diagnosis is usually made with MRI or CT. Treatment is surgical in most cases. The prognosis is variable due to the diverse histological findings and it may require the use of complementary treatments as chemotherapy or radiation."
CD008686,0,19265301,0,[Primary multifocal osseous Hodgkin lymphoma].,"A 28-year-old Japanese man presented with a 14-month history of right pelvic and lumbar pain. Despite normal findings on X-ray and CT scan at a previous hospital, sternal tumor had arisen and fever, night sweat, and weight loss developed 5 months before admission. Core needle biopsy of the sternal tumor was performed and a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (mixed cellularity) was made. FDG-PET scan demonstrated increased FDG uptake in the sternum, the right ilium, the right 9(th) rib, and the lower edge of the left scapula, but there were no other apparent lesions. Neither bone marrow biopsy nor cerebrospinal fluid examination showed infiltration of lymphoma cells. ABVD was started and the symptoms resolved immediately. After 6 cycles of ABVD, the patient achieved complete remission and local radiotherapy for the right ilium was added. Primary osseous HL confined to the bone is so rare that only 16 cases have been reported worldwide to date, with none of these cases being from Japan. Since there have not yet been any characteristic symptoms or laboratory findings identified, the diagnosis of osseous HL is difficult and may be delayed. Although systemic chemotherapy appears to have been effective in the reported cases, more cases should be reviewed to clarify its pathophysiological features."
CD008686,0,19263357,0,Intraventricular dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor-like neoplasm with disseminated spinal tumor.,"Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT)- like lesions arise in extracortical locations and behave in a benign fashion similar to that of cortical DNTs. They usually come to attention by symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure rather than focal neurological impairment. Here we report a case of 9-year-old boy with a complaint of headache and back pain. A third ventricular mass lesion with disseminated spinal tumor was detected on his magnetic resonance imaging. The presence of floating neurons in a mucinous matrix, oligodendrocyte-like cells (OLCs) aligning axonal columns and vessels, immunohistochemical profile of the neoplasm in addition to the clinical and radiological manifestations of the patient led to the diagnosis of ""DNT-like neoplasm of the third ventricle""."

X-rays demonstrated a step in the left massa lateralis of the sacrum, thus CT scans and MRI were performed, and multiple perineural cysts (Tarlov's cysts) were found. The patient underwent microsurgical treatment by fenestration of the cyst wall and evacuation of the fluid content in order to avoid further expansion of the cysts. Under consequent treatment with pain killers, complete mobilisation of the patient could be achieved. Ambulant follow-up by clinical controls and X-rays demonstrated a substantial resolution of the patient's preoperative symptoms. Symptomatic perineural cysts should be included into differential diagnosis of severe low back pain, thus CT or MRI scans should be performed in case of long-lasting or intrackable pain."

CD008686,0,19258287,0,Acute transverse myelitis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in childhood: spectrum or separate entities?,"The clinical and radiological features of childhood acute transverse myelitis are compared to those of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis with spinal cord involvement in 22 children with acute transverse myelitis and 12 children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis with spinal cord involvement. Children with acute transverse myelitis were more likely to have a sensory level (55%) and areflexia. Sixty-eight percent of the children with acute transverse myelitis, and 92% of children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis had longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. Demyelination was more extensive in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (mean 15.6 vertebral segments) than in acute transverse myelitis (mean 8.0 vertebral segments). The outcome was normal to good in 82% with acute transverse myelitis and in 100% with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Persistent bladder dysfunction was uncommon in both. Poor prognostic factors in acute transverse myelitis are flaccid paraparesis, respiratory failure, and age less than 6 months. These clinical and radiological differences suggest acute transverse myelitis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis are separate entities."
CD008686,0,19255725,0,Assessment of image-guided CyberKnife radiosurgery for metastatic spine tumors.,"Spinal metastases are associated with significant symptoms. From September 2005 to September 2007, 69 consecutive patients with 127 malignant spine metastatic lesions were treated at Wanfang Hospital with CyberKnife (CK) radiosurgery. The radiosurgery dose ranged from 10 to 30 Gy (mean 15.5 Gy) prescribed to the 75-85% isodose line that encompassed at least 95% of the tumor volume. We used fiducials as tracking landmarks for CK treatment of the thoracic and lumbar spine. A torso anthropomorphic phantom and GafChromic MD-55 films were used to verify the accuracy of CK radiosurgery and 2D dose distribution, demonstrated high targeting accuracy with 2% average deviation of the measured dose from the estimated dose at the set-up center and less than 5% dose deviation in 2D isodose curve. Visual Analogue Scale and Oswestry Disability Index questionnaires were used to monitor functional outcome after radiosurgery. Local tumor control at 10 months was 96.8%. Mean pain scores decreased significantly from 65 to 30 after treatment (P = 0.001). Functional disability was significantly improved after treatment (P = 0.002). The most common treatment toxicities were nausea and fatigue. In conclusion, CK radiosurgery is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for spine tumors with good local tumor control and a favorable outcome on pain and functional improvement after treatment."

There is also a scarcity of studies concerning the potential benefits of this procedure. All patients with RCC who underwent pre-operative PRAE before nephrectomy (n = 227) and all patients solely undergoing surgery (n = 607) at our institution from 1992 to 2006 were included. Information on techniques used, perioperative transfusion requirements, pathological and clinical variables, acute toxicity and complications were obtained from a retrospective review of medical records. Propensity modelling techniques were used to compare cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) in both groups. Propensity scores were calculated from a logistic matching model including age, gender, clinical tumour size, grading, pN stage, cM stage, pT stage, histology and microvascular invasion. This resulted in 189 matches. The mean follow-up of the entire group of matched patients was 81 months. The 5-year actuarial CSS and OS for the total group of matched patients was 80.8% and 73.9%, respectively. CSS and OS did not show any significant differences between the matched treatment groups. There were no statistical differences in surgical complications between all patients treated with pre-operative PRAE (n = 227) and all patients without PRAE (n = 607), except for blood transfusion (61% vs 24%; p<0.01). Symptoms of post-embolization syndrome, including lumbar pain, fever, nausea, hypertension and macroscopic haematuria, were reported by 202 patients (89%), in most cases being mild and self-limited. There is no conclusive evidence that pre-operative PRAE provides survival benefits in the management of surgically resected RCC."

These lesions commonly present as painless, slow-growing mobile masses. We describe a unique case of a 41-year-old woman presenting with a posterior neck swelling and longstanding history of severe ongoing pain in the right scapular region, shoulder and neck, weakness of the palmar grip and limited right lateral neck flexion and rotation. A history of trauma to the right neck in adolescence was noted. Histological analysis revealed a paucicellular lesion with spindle and stellate-shaped fibroblasts involving the cervical nerve roots, typical of collagenous fibroma. In a literature search on Medline and Pubmed, we found no reported cases of collagenous fibromas presenting with neurological symptoms. This report highlights the potential of these lesions to present with neurological symptoms due to infiltration of surrounding tissues, and that preceding trauma may contribute to the aetiology."

While some of these patients present acutely with neck pain and neurological deficits, in others the signs and symptoms may be more subtle. Two patients with CV junction involvement are described. One patient suffered from fracture of the anterior arch of atlas after being involved in a motor vehicle accident and the other had craniovertebral Pott's disease. A detailed history and clinical examination was carried out paying special attention to the situation when patients attempted to recline or while getting up from a reclining position. Patients were further investigated with imaging studies which focused on the CV junction. It was noted that patients with CV junction involvement frequently support their head while attempting to recline or when getting up from a reclining posture.

Their radiographic appearance may cause them to be confused with more serious entities such as fractures, locked facets, and tumor-induced bony erosions. It is important to distinguish these posterior arch abnormalities from the other entities because the treatment is very different."
CD008686,0,19226083,0,Serotonin toxicity as a consequence of linezolid use in revision hip arthroplasty.,"Linezolid is the first in a new group of antibiotics called oxazolidinones. As a potent antimicrobial, it has activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and macrolide-resistant streptococci. There are several documented case reports of serotonin toxicity when used with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The symptoms of serotonin syndrome are alteration of mental state, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular disorders. This article presents a case of an interaction of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine and linezolid and the possible diagnostic problems that can occur. A 58-year-old woman presented with signs of systemic infection. Her medical history included bladder resection for transitional cell carcinoma, bilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA), and depression, for which she was on venlafaxine. Serological and imaging investigations revealed MRSA infection of the bilateral THA. The patient was started on vancomycin and rifampicin intravenously. As intravenous access was becoming problematic and long-term antibiotics were needed, treatment was changed to oral linezolid and oral rifampicin. Four days after the commencement of linezolid, the patient was acutely disorientated with generalized cerebellar signs and no autonomic dysfunction. A computed tomography scan of the head and lumbar puncture revealed no abnormal findings. A diagnosis of serotonin toxicity was made. The patient recovered when linezolid and venlafaxine were discontinued and supportive measures were provided. Linezolid is a popular choice of antibiotic, especially for the treatment of orthopedic-related MRSA infections. Patients who commonly require linezolid as an antimicrobial are those with complex infections where other antibiotic treatment has failed. It is therefore important to be vigilant with linezolid use. Physicians should be aware of the nonspecific presentation of serotonin symptoms and the treatment."
CD008686,0,19224061,0,Aggressive osteoblastoma of the proximal humerus.,"A nine-year-old boy presented with increasingly worsening right shoulder pain of 18 months' duration. On physical examination, there was a tender firm swelling over the right upper arm. Radiographs showed a large osteolytic lesion in the proximal humeral diaphysis, with prominent mixed acute-on-chronic periosteal reaction in a lamellar fashion. There was a pathological fracture. The lesion appeared to be radiographically aggressive in nature. Bone scintiscan showed solitary marked uptake. On-table frozen section histopathological examination of the lesion showed an osteoblastic lesion with aggressive features. Completion curettage and high speed burring of the cavity was performed. In view of the patient's young age, which required a biological solution, and potential for local recurrence, that necessitated a radiopaque filler, the lesion was packed with a calcium phosphate cement paste. The final diagnosis was osteoblastoma with aggressive features. The patient remained well on follow-up to date. The filler continues to be remodelled to native tissue and there is no evidence of local recurrence. Osteoblastoma is a relatively rare benign tumour that typically occurs in the posterior elements of the vertebral column. The humerus is a very rare site of disease in the appendicular skeleton, and poses a diagnostic dilemma which implicates the possibility of osteogenic sarcoma."

CD008686,0,19210218,0,Advanced vertebral fracture among newly diagnosed children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: results of the Canadian Steroid-Associated Osteoporosis in the Pediatric Population (STOPP) research program.,"Vertebral compression is a serious complication of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The prevalence and pattern of vertebral fractures, as well as their relationship to BMD and other clinical indices, have not been systematically studied. We evaluated spine health in 186 newly diagnosed children (median age, 5.3 yr; 108 boys) with ALL (precursor B cell: N = 167; T cell: N = 19) who were enrolled in a national bone health research program. Patients were assessed within 30 days of diagnosis by lateral thoraco-lumbar spine radiograph, bone age (also used for metacarpal morphometry), and BMD. Vertebral morphometry was carried out by the Genant semiquantitative method. Twenty-nine patients (16%) had a total of 75 grade 1 or higher prevalent vertebral compression fractures (53 thoracic, 71%; 22 lumbar). Grade 1 fractures as the worst grade were present in 14 children (48%), 9 patients (31%) had grade 2 fractures, and 6 children (21%) had grade 3 fractures. The distribution of spine fracture was bimodal, with most occurring in the midthoracic and thoraco-lumbar regions. Children with grade 1 or higher vertebral compression had reduced lumbar spine (LS) areal BMD Z-scores compared with those without (mean +/- SD, -2.1 +/- 1.5 versus -1.1 +/- 1.2; p < 0.001). LS BMD Z-score, second metacarpal percent cortical area Z-score, and back pain were associated with increased odds for fracture. For every 1 SD reduction in LS BMD Z-score, the odds for fracture increased by 80% (95% CI: 10-193%); the presence of back pain had an OR of 4.7 (95% CI: 1.5-14.5). These results show that vertebral compression is an under-recognized complication of newly diagnosed ALL. Whether the fractures will resolve through bone growth during or after leukemia chemotherapy remains to be determined."
CD008686,0,19208321,0,An uncommon cause of sciatica.,"A 67-year-old male patient underwent a left nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma. Thirty-eight months later, he presented with right sided lower backache, radiating to the posterior aspect of his thigh, calf and foot, paraesthesiae and numbness in the distribution of the right S1 and S2 dermatomes. The presumptive diagnosis was of nerve root entrapment secondary to a disc prolapse. MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine revealed an enlarged S1 root canal containing a solid solitary lesion suggestive of a neurofibroma of the S1 nerve root. Because of persistent pain, he underwent a right L5/S1 hemilaminectomy. A lesion originating from the right S2 nerve root was found and excised. The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery with complete resolution of his right leg pain. The histopathological examination revealed a portion of the nerve root and dorsal root ganglion infiltrated by metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Although uncommon, nerve root infiltration by a metastasis should be included in the differential diagnosis of back pain and sciatica, especially if there is a previous history of malignant disease."

CD008686,0,19201747,0,Recombinant human erythropoietin attenuates spinal neuroimmune activation of neuropathic pain in rats.,"Neuropathic pain is a complex syndrome resulting from damage to the peripheral nervous system. Central neuroimmune activation contributes to the generation and maintenance of chronic pain after nerve injury. The current study determined the effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) on behavioral hyperalgesia and neuroimmune activation in a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by L5 spinal nerve transection. Animals were randomly assigned into 3 groups: sham-operation with saline; L5 spinal nerve transection with rhEPO (5000 units/kg); or L5 transection with saline. The rhEPO or saline was given ip on the day before surgery and continued daily to day 7 post-transection. The paw pressure threshold and paw withdrawal latencies were measured before surgery and on days 1, 3, and 7 post-operation. Glial activation markers such as macrophage antigen complex-1 (Mac-1, OX-42) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-10, as well as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation were determined in the lumbar spinal cord. Administration of rhEPO resulted in attenuation of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. Furthermore, rhEPO markedly inhibited neuroimmune activation characterized by glial activation, production of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and NF-kappaB activation, but rhEPO enhanced the level of IL-10. These results support the significance of neuroinflammation and neuroimmune activation in the initiation and persistence of behavioral pain responses. The data indicate that rhEPO attenuates behavioral hyperalgesia and neuroimmune activation in neuropathic pain induced by L5 nerve transection."
CD008686,0,19190061,0,The effect of early surgical treatment on recovery in patients with metastatic compression of the spinal cord.,"We analysed the influence of the timing of surgery (< 48 hours, group 1, 21 patients vs > 48 hours, group 2, 14 patients) on the neurological outcome and restoration of mobility in 35 incomplete tetra- and paraplegic patients with metastatic spinal-cord compression. Pain and neurological symptoms were assessed using the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale. More improvement was found in group 1 than in group 2 when comparing the pre-operative findings with those both immediately post-operatively (p = 0.021) and those at follow-up at four to six weeks (p = 0.010). In group 1 the number of pre-operatively mobile patients increased from 17 (81%) to 19 patients (90%) whereas the number of mobile patients in group 2 changed from nine (64%) to ten (71%). These results suggest that early surgical treatment in patients with metastatic spinal-cord compression gives a better neurological outcome even in a palliative situation."
CD008686,0,19188080,0,Pain therapy.,"Cancer-related pain is a major issue of healthcare systems worldwide. The reported incidence, considering all stages of the disease, is 51%, which can increase to 74% in the advanced and terminal stages. For advanced cancer, pain is moderate to severe in about 40-50% and very severe or excruciating in 25-30% of cases. Pain is both a sensation and an emotional experience. Pain is always subjective; and may be affected by emotional, social and spiritual components thus it has been defined as ""total pain"". From a pathophysiological point of view, pain can be classified as nociceptive (somatic and visceral), neuropathic (central, peripheral, sympathetic) idiopathic or psychogenic. A proper pain assessment is fundamental for an effective and individualised treatment. In 1986 the World Health Organisation (WHO) published analgesic guidelines for the treatment of cancer pain based on a three-step ladder and practical recommendations. These guidelines serve as an algorithm for a sequential pharmacological approach to treatment according to the intensity of pain as reported by the patient. The WHO analgesic ladder remains the clinical model for pain therapy. Its clinical application should be employed only after a complete and comprehensive assessment and evaluation based on the needs of each patient. When applying the WHO guidelines, up to 90% of patients can find relief regardless of the settings of care, social and/or cultural environment. This is the standard treatment on a type C basis. Only when such an approach is ineffective are interventions such as spinal administration of opioid analgesics or neuroinvasive procedures recommended."
CD008686,0,19185984,0,Nerve root prolapse into a spinal arachnoid cyst--an unusual cause of radiculopathy.,"Arachnoid cysts are rare lesions of the spine and can present with myelopathy, radiculopathy, local pain or a combination of these symptoms. Nerve root prolapse into an arachnoid cyst causing radiculopathy has not been reported before. We report a nerve root prolapse into a spinal arachnoid cyst presenting clinically as radiculopathy. An 18-year-old female patient presented with mid-back pain, right anterior thigh pain and hip flexor weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) myelography revealed an arachnoid cyst at T12-L1 level on the right side. At surgery, a nerve root was seen prolapsing into an extradural arachnoid cyst. The nerve root was replaced back into dural sac and the dural defect closed. At 20 months of follow-up, the patient continues to be asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence on imaging. Replacing the prolapsed nerve root into the dural sac with meticulous closure of the dural defect could lead to good clinical outcome. We propose a modification to the popular classification of these lesions to better rationalize their surgical management. Classification of extradural arachnoid spinal cysts (Nabors's type 1) should be based on the presence or absence of dural communication. Sacral meningoceles (Nabors' type 1B) should be excluded from the classification as they have free communication with the thecal sac and are not true spinal cysts."
CD008686,0,19181596,0,Sciatica caused by pseudomyxoma peritonei.,"Many etiologies may cause sciatica, and intra-abdominal masses usually affect the lumbosacral plexus by local invasion or distal metastases. Lumbosacral plexopathy caused by compression of intra-abdominal tumors instead of invasion is rarely seen. A 67-year-old woman had a 3-month history of progressive neurogenic claudication, lumbago and left L5 radiculopathy with foot drop. Nocturia and progressive abdominal distension with voiding dysfunction were also noted. Imaging studies showed a huge pelvic mass with severe compression of the left lumbosacral trunk. There was no direct invasion of the lumbosacral plexus by the pelvic mass noted in the preoperative imaging studies or intraoperative findings. Bilateral ovarian borderline mucinous cystic tumor with pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) was diagnosed, and the sciatica was improved dramatically after subsequent abdominal debulking surgery. Although rare, neural compression caused by PMP and intra-abdominal masses needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of sciatica."
CD008686,0,19179905,0,Prevention and management of bone metastases in lung cancer: a review.,"Approximately 30 to 40% of patients with advanced lung cancer will develop bone metastases in the course of their disease, resulting in a significant negative impact on both morbidity and survival. Skeletal complications of bone metastases include pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. Total medical care costs are greater among patients with bone metastases who develop skeletal complications. A randomized phase III trial of the third generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid has shown clinical benefit in the management of a subgroup of patients with bone metastases from lung cancer. Zoledronic acid treatment was associated with a reduction in both the risk of, and time to, a skeletal-related event. One of the markers of bone resorption, N-telopeptide, is both prognositic for development of skeletal-related events and predictive for benefit from zoledronic acid. In preclinical models, bisphosphonates have also demonstrated antitumor activity and are therefore currently being evaluated in adjuvant trials. Inhibition of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand-RANK pathway can reduce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and trials comparing receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand inhibitors with bisphosphonates are ongoing, including patients with lung cancer. In this article, we review the management of bone metastases and hypercalcemia as well as potential future directions for bone directed therapies in patients with lung cancer."

CD008686,0,19169679,0,Transarticular spread of Ewing sarcoma mimicking septic arthritis.,"Transarticular spread of tumor is rare; it has only been reported in the sacroiliac joint, intervertebral disk spaces, and facet joints. The anatomic and kinetic characteristics of the sacroiliac joint, as well as the changes the joint undergoes during a lifetime, make it particularly vulnerable to transarticular tumor invasion. Although extremely rare, Ewing sarcoma can extend through the sacroiliac joint and be virtually indistinguishable radiologically from septic arthritis. Furthermore, the clinical presentation of a child with Ewing sarcoma can be similar to that of a child with osteomyelitis. Laboratory values are quite nonspecific and are not always helpful in differentiating between the entities. Therefore, the possibility of sacroiliac joint transarticular Ewing sarcoma should be considered in a child presenting with hip pain, despite clinical, radiological and laboratory findings suggesting an infectious process."
CD008686,0,19158971,0,Pain and osteolysis of the thoracic spine--a case of a rare monostotic fibrous dysplasia manifestation.,"We describe a case of a young farmer from Central Macedonia, Greece suffering of a mild back pain more than one year. His medical history included hypercholesterolaemia (IIa type) and two episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax of unknown origin two and three years ago respectively. A full imaging survey revealed a single osteolytic lesion at the seventh thoracic vertebra. A CT guided needle biopsy was performed. Diagnosis based on clinical, imaging and histological findings was monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the thoracic spine. We discuss the clinical features and treatment of this non neoplastic condition which may simulate bone osteolytic tumor. Furthermore a possible correlation of concomitant conditions existing in our patient such as the metabolic disorder of hypercholesterolaemia and especially the history of spontaneous pneumothorax episodes with fibrous dysplasia within the spectrum of connective tissue disorder is discussed."

CD008686,0,19119933,0,Primary choroid plexus papilloma of the sacral nerve roots.,"The authors describe a unique case of a choroid plexus papilloma of the sacral nerve roots. This 60-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of a 1-year history of sacral pain, rectal and urinary bladder retention, and paradoxical episodic incontinence. Physical examination revealed sensory abnormalities in the S-2 dermatomes and poor rectal and bladder sphincter contractions. Contrast-enhanced spinal MR imaging showed a well-circumscribed, ovoid, homogeneously enhancing mass at the S1-2 level suggesting a diagnosis of ependymoma or schwannoma, and surgery allowed the identification and complete removal of a soft gray mass intimately adhering to the sacral nerve roots. Histological examination revealed a tumor consisting of papillary structures lined by a single layer of columnar cells, with an immunophenotype that satisfied the diagnostic criteria of choroid plexus papilloma. After diagnosis, contrast-enhanced brain MR imaging excluded the presence of a primary choroid plexus papilloma in the cerebral ventricles, thus ruling out a drop metastasis along the CSF pathways. A review of the literature did not reveal any similar cases of choroid plexus papilloma, and so the authors also discuss the inclusion of primary or metastatic papillary tumors in this unusual location as part of the differential diagnosis."

We report a rare case of adult-onset intradural extramedullary teratoma in the thoracolumbar spinal cord with no evidence of spinal dysraphism and without the history of prior spinal surgery. The patient was a 38-year-old male whose chief complaint was urinary incontinence. X-ray images of the thoracolumbar spine showed the widening of the interpedicular distance and posterior marginal erosion of the vertebral bodies and pedicles at the T11, T12, and L1 level. Magnetic resonance imagings of the lumbar spine showed a lobulated inhomogeneous high signal intradural mass (87x29x20 mm) between T11 and L1 and a high signal fluid collection at the T11 level. Laminectomy of the T11-L1 region was performed, and the mass was subtotally excised. The resected tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as a mature cystic teratoma.

CD008686,0,21048565,0,Evaluating the child with unsteady gait.,"Unsteady gait is a relatively common presentation to the pediatric emergency and neurology services. Unsteadiness can be due to a wide variety of causes, however, the primary concern on initial assessment is to exclude serious disorders such as meningitis, encephalitis, or brain tumors. Recognizing benign and non-neurological causes of unsteady gait is essential to avoid unnecessary investigations and hospital admission. In this review, a clinical approach to the unsteady child is presented with discussion of diagnostic considerations, approach to investigation, treatment, and prognosis. Ataxia can be cerebellar or sensory. Cerebellar ataxia can be acute, chronic, progressive, or episodic. It may result from trauma, infections, metabolic, degenerative disease, space occupying lesions, or congenital anomalies. Sensory ataxia is due to peripheral neuropathy involving large myelinated fibers that carry vibration and position sense, or due to posterior spinal column dysfunction. Accurate assessment depends on detailed history, examination, and then formulation of a differential diagnosis list to guide laboratory investigations."

Notwithstanding their overwhelmingly benign propensity, the occurrence of extramedullary meningioma may nonetheless cause significant morbidity and possible mortality. The consideration therefore, of spinal meningioma in the differential of patients presenting with radiculopathy or complaints of chronic back or neck pain should not be disregarded. The rapidity of diagnosis and the first neurosurgical encounter are cornerstones in patient longevity and neurological preservation. The advent of microsurgical techniques and magnetic resonance imaging and surgical techniques has notably improved clinical outcomes over the past two decades. However, surgical candidacy may be limited, particularly in those patients with significant preexisting medical comorbidities, aggressive or recurring tumors, or multiple lesions. Alternative management strategies such as stereotactic radiosurgery or less invasive surgical techniques are currently underway in clinical practice. A review on neurosurgical diagnosis and treatment modalities in the management of spinal meningioma is therefore pertinent."

The diagnosis should be considered in neonates with large pigmented nevi and in those with more than 3 hairy dark nevi regardless of their size. Neonates with neurocutaneous melanosis are at risk of developing neurological problems. The most common neurological complications are hydrocephalus, seizures, cranial nerve dysfunction, and signs of spinal cord and root involvement. The authors report 3 cases of histologically confirmed neurocutaneous melanosis and describe the course of neurological symptoms and clinical findings including cognitive tests and neuroimaging. The case reports are complemented by an up-to date review on this clinical entity."

CD008686,0,19070267,0,Intrathecal drug delivery for management of cancer and noncancer pain.,"Intrathecal drug delivery (ITDD) has been an option for the management of persistent pain since the 1980s. The discovery of opioid receptors in the central nervous system was the impetus for early attempts to deliver opioids intraspinally. Approximately, 10-20 percent patients with cancer pain get inadequate analgesia from conventional medical management; this group particularly may benefit from ITDD. However, there is also some evidence for the use of ITDD in those with noncancer pain. This review presents options for ITDD, available drugs, evidence for efficacy, principles of patient selection, and problems with the intrathecal route."

Patients with osteolytic metastases often experience intractable local and/or radicular pain. Therapeutic intervention can alleviate pain, preserve or improve neurologic function, achieve mechanical stability, and improve quality of life. Percutaneous polymethylmethacrylate vertebroplasty is an effective and relatively easy method of relieving patients' pain."
CD008686,0,19066642,0,Documentation of red flags by physical therapists for patients with low back pain.,"The comprehensiveness of physical therapists' adherence to the guidelines for red flag documentation for patients with low back pain has not previously been described. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to describe that comprehensiveness. Red flags are warning signs that suggest that physician referral may be warranted. Clinic charts for 160 patients with low back pain seen at 6 outpatient physical therapy clinics were retrospectively reviewed, noting the presence or absence of 11 red flag items. Seven of the 11 red flag items were documented over 98% of the time. Most charts (96.3%) had at least 64% of the red flag items documented. Documentation of red flags was comprehensive in some areas but lacking in others. Red flags that were regularly documented included age over 50, bladder dysfunction, history of cancer, immune suppression, night pain, history of trauma, saddle anesthesia, and lower extremity neurological deficit. The red flags not regularly documented included weight loss, recent infection, and fever/chills. Factors influencing item documentation comprehensiveness are discussed, and suggestions are provided to enhance the completeness of recording patient examination data. The study results provide a red flag documentation benchmark for clinicians working with patients with low back pain and they lay the groundwork for future research."
CD008686,0,19064053,0,Primary malignant tumors of the spine.,"Primary malignant tumors of the spine account for less than 5% of primary bone tumors. Data from the SEER program suggest that the most common bone sarcomas are osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, chordoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma/fibrosarcoma. During the last two decades, tremendous progress has been made in clinical aspects, surgical approaches, and reconstruction with instrumentation at all levels of the spine. Stabilization procedures, including vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, have further allowed palliation of pain and symptom relief from compression fractures. Improved radiation techniques have offered the potential for improved local control. This article reviews the changes in surgical philosophy in the management of malignant spinal tumors during the past two decades."

Standard treatment options, including conventional radiotherapy and surgery, are often limited by anatomic constraints and previous treatment. Image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery using the CyberKnife system (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) is a novel approach in the multidisciplinary management of spinal tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery on pain and quality-of-life outcomes of patients with spinal tumors."
CD008686,0,19053025,0,Intracranial germinoma as a very rare cause of panhypopituitarism in a 23-year old man.,"A 23 year-old patient was referred to the endocrine outpatient clinic with the suspicion of diabetes insipidus as he complained of nycturia and polydipsia since 2-3 months. Further he presented with nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, rapid weight loss, diffuse body pain and fatigue. No headache, blurred vision, or fever were reported. The clinical examination showed sexual infantilism (poor beard, pubic and axillary hair growth, small testis). The patient's skin was strikingly pale as well as dry and scaly. Lymph node palpation was unremarkable. Endocrine evaluation revealed diabetes insipidus as well as complete anterior pituitary insufficiency. MR imaging demonstrated contrast-enhancing mass lesions at the pineal gland, hypothalamus, and anterior horn of lateral ventricles bilaterally. The localization pattern deemed to be highly suspicious for intracranial germinoma. As beta-HCG and AFP were negative in serum and cerebrospinal fluid the diagnosis of germinoma was confirmed histologically. After radiotherapy with cranio-spinal radiation therapy with 24 Gy followed by two weeks of local tumor boost with 16 Gy, the posttherapy MRI scan indicated complete tumor removal. This case demonstrates a very rare and potentially curable tumor as the cause of panhypopituitarism in adults."

A 34-year-old woman presented with a left suboccipital mass causing local pain and neck stiffness. Following physical examination, fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed, which revealed benign cytology. In the light of preoperative radiologic examination and intraoperative observations, the lesion was thought to originate from the greater occipital nerve. Following complete excision of the lesion, histopathological diagnosis was made as schwannoma. Apart from mild neck stiffness and transient local paresthesia in the early postoperative period, no complications were seen during a two-year follow-up period."

Their respective actions are directed to different components of the nociceptive afference. Hematological clinical practice daily challenges diseases in with pain may be a very important symptom, ranging from acute leukemia to the common effects of certain chemotherapy regimens. Multiple myeloma gives one of the best example of a disease in which pain can be inflammatory (the compression of a nerve root) or neuropathic (demyelinating process) in origin. The use of acetaminophen/tramadol combination in the common ward or outward activity with myeloma patients indicates how it is possible to reach a good control of chronic pain with a minimum overlapping of the toxicities related to the primary disease as well as to the specific treatment. Furthermore, acetaminophen/tramadol combination is extremely useful also in those clinical situations in which a short term pain control is needed, particularly for the optimal safety profile."

It is therefore important to validate the reported scs to determine if they hold true across similar patient populations."
CD008686,0,19008588,0,Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis with pseudomyxoma peritonei.,"Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis is an extremely rare tumor with very few case reports in literature. Pseudomyxoma peritonei is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of mucinous gelatinous material in the peritoneal cavity. It occurs secondary to primary mucinous neoplasms of particularly the appendix and the ovary. We present a case of a 35-year-old female who had a history of dull aching pain in the right flank since one and a half years. Upon ultrasonography (USG) and computerized tomography (CT) scan, there was a large cystic mass measuring 15x15x12 cm, extending into the right lumbar region. Grossly, the entire kidney was converted into a cystic mass measuring 15x15x12 cm containing gelatinous mucinous material weighing 1 kg. Histologically, the tumor was composed of simple and complex glandular acini together with a superficial resemblance to colonic mucosa with abundant extracellular mucin. Thus, a diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis leading to pseudomyxoma peritonei was made."

A 69-year-old female presented in December 2007 with a 5-month history of proximal muscle weakness, pain, fatigue and difficulty in walking and swallowing. Blood tests revealed elevated creatine kinase (3,429 U/l) and lactate dehydrogenase (2,013 U/l) levels. Magnetic resonance imaging found lumbar disc protrusion. Review by immunologists showed a diagnosis of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Though electromyography and muscle biopsy at this point were non-specific, corticosteroid treatment was commenced. Her condition worsened precipitously leading to hospitalisation under immunologists. As the provisional diagnosis was polymyositis, we commenced 1.5 mg/kg per day corticosteroid but her muscle power did not improve. Recurrent abdominal symptoms lead to ultrasonography showing intestinal inflammation. While tumour markers were elevated, thorough investigation failed to identify a tumour. Corticosteroid therapy was continued. Persistent abdominal symptoms lead to repeat colonoscopy and biopsy confirming Crohn's disease. Repeat electromyography and muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of polymyositis. Her corticosteroids were tapered off and 5-aminosalicylic acid and azathioprine were started. Her myositic symptoms gradually abated with improvement in her Crohn's disease. She is now able to walk independently and takes 8 mg/day corticosteroids and her muscle enzyme levels are normal. Remember rare systemic associations when dealing with immune-mediated disease. Consider myositis in the differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease associated myopathy. Treating Crohn's disease may lead to improvement in steroid-resistant myositis where the two are associated."

The case of a 74-year-old female patient (BMI 16.8 kg/m(2)) with a metastasising bronchial carcinoma is reported, who suffered from severe back pain due to tumour infiltration. For pain management a tunnelled continuous thoracic peridural catheter (PC) was placed and a mixture of bupivacaine 0.49%, morphine 0.0036% and clonidine 0.0001% was infused at 3 ml/h. After 8 weeks of continuous infusion an ulcer developed in the soft tissue close to the thoracic spine containing whitish crystalline material (CM). A computed tomography examination revealed a subcutaneously displaced PC with extensive fluid collection reaching down to the sacrospinalis muscle. Histologically an unreactive necrosis with enclosed CM of unknown etiology was found. The result of the chemical analysis of the deposits demonstrated bupivacaine, morphine and sodium chloride.

Staging examinations including CT scan of the thorax and abdomen as well as bone scintigraphy were inconspicuous. The patient underwent 6 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (VIDE, similar to Euro Ewing 99). Presurgically, embolisation of the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies was performed on both sides. The tumour was removed via a dorsal approach with corporectomy of L5 and resection of the right nerve root of L5. The defect was bridged by a titanium cage filled with bone cement; a dorsal L4-S1 instrumentation was performed. Early postoperative X-rays showed a screw dislocation in S1, making a revision intervention and screw replacement necessary. For additional fixation, S2 was instrumented. Histopathology classified the tissue samples as containing no active tumour cells. Surgery was followed by additional chemotherapy. The patient has remained free of recurrence until now. The aim of this case report is to call attention to the unusual site of the Ewing sarcoma as well as to discuss therapy options, especially dorsal corporectomy, and the prognosis together with a review of the most current literature."

Report of 4 cases.,"Only 6 cases of pyogenic spondylitis following vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty have been reported, and their causes remained unclear. The authors report on 4 cases of delayed pyogenic spondylitis (DPS) following vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty for osteoporotic compression fractures and metastatic disease. Four patients presented with DPS after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty and underwent surgical treatment. Clinical history, laboratory examination, and MR imaging confirmed the diagnosis of DPS. Anterior debridement, reconstruction, and posterior instrumented fusion were performed. The mean interval for the delayed occurrence of pyogenic spondylitis after surgery was 12.3 months. The infections were primarily bacterial in origin, but most patients also suffered diverse medical comorbidities. Despite successful treatment of the infections, comorbidity was and is a factor that compromises good results. Medical comorbidities associated with compromised immunity may increase susceptibility to DPS after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. In cases of incapacitating back pain after a pain-free period following either of these surgeries, evaluation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level and examination of contrast-enhanced MR imaging studies are essential to rule out delayed vertebral infection. Surgical treatment requires cement removal and anterior reconstruction with or without additional posterior instrumented fusion."
CD008686,0,18923424,0,"ASIC3, a sensor of acidic and primary inflammatory pain.","Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are cationic channels activated by extracellular acidosis that are expressed in both central and peripheral nervous systems. Although peripheral ASICs seem to be natural sensors of acidic pain (e.g., in inflammation, ischaemia, lesions or tumours), a direct demonstration is still lacking. We show that approximately 60% of rat cutaneous sensory neurons express ASIC3-like currents. Native as well as recombinant ASIC3 respond synergistically to three different inflammatory signals that are slight acidifications (approximately pH 7.0), hypertonicity and arachidonic acid (AA). Moderate pH, alone or in combination with hypertonicity and AA, increases nociceptors excitability and produces pain suppressed by the toxin APETx2, a specific blocker of ASIC3. Both APETx2 and the in vivo knockdown of ASIC3 with a specific siRNA also have potent analgesic effects against primary inflammation-induced hyperalgesia in rat. Peripheral ASIC3 channels are thus essential sensors of acidic pain and integrators of molecular signals produced during inflammation where they contribute to primary hyperalgesia."

CD008686,0,18855293,0,Minimally invasive vertebroplasty in the treatment of pain induced by spinal metastatic tumor.,"Spinal metastatic tumor is a common problem and represents a challenging problem in oncology practice. Patients with osteolytic metastases often suffer from intractable local and/or radicular pain. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive, radiologically guided procedure whereby bone cement is injected into structurally weakened vertebrae to provide immediate biomechanical stability. Vertebroplasty is also used to relieve pain by stabilizing metastatically compromised vertebrae that are at risk of pathological burst fracture. In this retrospective study, a total of 57 patients (78 vertebrae) with spinal metastatic tumor were treated with PMMA vertebroplasty. The mean value of the visual analogue scale (VAS) was 8.1 +/- 0.67 preoperatively, and significantly decreased to 3.8 +/- 1.9 (1-8, p < 0.015) one day after vertebroplasty. The mean VAS value 6 months after vertebroplsty was 2.8 +/- 2.0 (p < 0.001). Mean injected bone cement amount in our study is 5.16 +/- 1.6 mL. The complication rate is about 21.8%, bone cement extravasation without neurological deficit is the most common complication. No new or adjacent vertebral fracture has occurred in more than 2 years follow-up. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that offers a remarkable advantage of effective and immediate pain relief with few complications."

A subsequent chest CT scan indicated a 4 cm left hilar mass, extending to the apex and encasing a portion of the left bronchus and pulmonary artery. Initial bronchoscopic and transthoracic biopsies failed to obtain diagnostic material. The patient underwent thoracotomy and was found to have a locally advanced, surgically unresectable lung tumor, involving the pleura, pericardium and diaphragm. The patient failed to respond to radiochemotherapy, and died 11 months following the diagnosis with tamponade and metastasis to the skin of the thoracoabdominal wall. Histologically the tumor had an epithelioid and spindled appearance, without high-grade histological features, and was initially thought to represent biphasic diffuse malignant mesothelioma. Positive immunohistochemistry for vascular markers (CD31, CD34, and FLI-1) disclosed the vascular nature of the tumor. Mesothelioma markers were universally negative and cytokeratin was focally reactive only in some epithelioid cells. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare tumor in the lung that can mimic other more common pathological entities, and should be included in the differential diagnosis of unusual pulmonary neoplasms with epithelioid or biphasic morphology."

CD008686,0,18841731,0,Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment choices.,"Acute lumbar disk herniations are the most common cause of sciatica. After excluding emergent causes, such as cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess, fracture, or malignancy, a six-week trial of conservative management is indicated. Patients should be advised to stay active. If symptoms persist after six weeks, or if there is worsening neurologic function, imaging and invasive procedures may be considered. Most patients with lumbar disk herniations improve over six weeks. Because there is no difference in outcomes between surgical and conservative treatment after two years, patient preference and the severity of the disability from the pain should be considered when choosing treatment modalities. If a disk herniation is identified that correlates with physical findings, surgical diskectomy may improve symptoms more quickly than continued conservative management. Epidural steroid injections can also provide short-term relief."

Magnetic resonance imaging of the vertebral column showed multiple osseous metastases. On the computerized tomography scan of the abdomen, a tumor of the lower esophagus just proximal to the esophagogastric band was seen, of which histological examination revealed an esophageal adenocarcinoma. Esophageal adenocarcinoma after bariatric surgery has been described previously in only a few cases. Although there is no evidence for a causal relationship with bariatric surgery, one should bear in mind that the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is increased in patients with morbid obesity because of the higher incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Also, the symptoms of adenocarcinoma might be masked after bariatric surgery."
CD008686,0,18838115,0,Selective stimulation of either tumor necrosis factor receptor differentially induces pain behavior in vivo and ectopic activity in sensory neurons in vitro.,"Recent studies suggest that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) sensitizes primary afferent neurons, and thus facilitates neuropathic pain. Here, we separately examined the roles of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 1 and 2 by parallel in vivo and in vitro paradigms using proteins that selectively activate TNFR1 or TNFR2 (R1 and R2). In vivo, intrathecally injected R1, but not R2 slightly reduced mechanical and thermal withdrawal thresholds in rats, whereas co-injection resulted in robust, at least additive pain-associated behavior. In vitro, the electrophysiological responses of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from rats with spinal nerve ligation were measured utilizing single-fiber recordings of teased dorsal root filaments. In naïve DRG, only R1 (10-1000 pg/ml) induced firing in Ass- and Adelta-fibers, whereas R2 had no effect. In injured DRG, both R1 and R2 at significantly lower concentrations (1 pg/ml) increased discharge rates of Adelta-fibers. Most interesting, in adjacent uninjured DRG, R2 and not R1, increased ectopic activity in both Ass- and Adelta-fibers. We conclude that TNFR1 may be predominantly involved in the excitation of sensory neurons and induction of pain behavior in the absence of nerve injury, TNFR2 may contribute in the presence of TNFR1 activation. Importantly, the effects of individually applied R1 and R2 on injured and adjacent uninjured fibers imply that the role of TNFR2 in the excitation of sensory neurons increases after injury."
CD008686,0,18836935,0,Orbital metastasis of renal cell carcinoma masquerading as cysticercosis.,"Metastasis to the orbital soft tissues is relatively uncommon. We report a rare case of renal cell carcinoma with orbital metastasis as the first clinical manifestation. A 48-year-old-man presented with left proptosis and complete ptosis of three weeks duration. Radiological examination revealed a left intraconal heterogeneous cyst-like lesion with rim enhancement immediately deep to the left superior rectus muscle. Diagnosed as having orbital cysticercosis, he was prescribed oral albendazole and prednisolone. But there was no clinical improvement. An incisional biopsy performed showed metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma. The patient complained of backache and weight loss in the interim. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed extensive vertebral metastasis to the thoracic and lumbosacral spine and the iliac bone, with an incidental detection of a large mass from the right kidney. Further MRI of abdomen and chest showed a large right renal mass presumed to be a renal cell carcinoma with extension into the right renal vein, intra-abdominal lymph nodes, and peritoneum. There were small nodules in the lung suggesting the possibility of pulmonary metastatic deposits. Renal cell carcinoma does not respond to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation; because of the disease's advanced stage, the patient received palliative treatment. There have been only two other reports in the literature of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the orbit where the proptosis was the initial presenting feature similar to our case."

The patient's phenotype corresponded to trichorhinophalangeal syndrome Type I. The authors attributed the origin of both the retrocerebellar cyst and the abnormal posterior fossa to endochondral ossification anomalies that occur in this syndrome. The patient's spinal pain was most likely a result of the combination of CM-I and syringomyelia. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on the association of CM-I and syringomyelia with a retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst occurring in a patient with trichorhinophalangeal syndrome Type I. The authors discuss the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the production of tonsillar descent and syringomyelia in this patient, and review the current literature on related conditions that can result in this association."
CD008686,0,18822882,0,[Comparative evaluation of 113 cases with severe and mild forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis].,"Tuberculosis, one of the oldest diseases of human beings, has still high mortality rates. In this prospective study, 113 HIV seronegative patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPT) who were admitted to our department between January 2001 and July 2006 have been evaluated and cases with severe or mild forms of EPT have been compared with respect to epidemiological and clinical features, laboratory results and treatment outcomes. The age range of the patients were 16-78 years old (mean age: 46.3 +/- 16.9 years), and 64 of them (56.6%) were female. Severe and mild forms of EPT were diagnosed in 49 (43.3%) and 64 (56.6%) of the patients, respectively. The most frequently involved organ was detected as lymph nodes (43.3%), followed by pleura and vertebrate involvements with the rates of 12.4%. There was an underlying disease in 35 (30.9%) of the patients (diabetes mellitus in 15%; chronic renal dysfunction in 11.5%; malignancy in 4.4%), history of passed tuberculosis infection in 13 (11.5%) and history of contact with a tuberculosis patient in 25 (22.1%). In direct microscopic examination, samples from 19 (16.8) patients were found positive for acid-fast bacilli, and samples cultivated in Lowenstein-Jensen media yielded mycobacterial growth in 25 (22.1%) patients. The diagnosis have been made histopathologically in 89 (78.7%) of the cases. In comparison of the patients with severe and mild forms of EPT, the severe form were detected more frequently in males (p= 0.01), the positivity rates of culture and acid-fast staining were higher in patients with severe form (p= 0.0004 and p= 0.001, respectively). The mortality rate was also found higher in patients with severe form (p= 0.046). The cases who were diagnosed as EPT have been treated by three or four antituberculosis drugs. Izoniazid (300 mg/day, 6-12 months), rifampicin (600 mg/day, 6-12 months), ethambutol (1500 mg/day, 2-4 months), pyrazinamide (2000 mg/day, 2-4 months) and streptomycin (1 g/day, 45-60 days) were used for the therapy. Side effects due to the therapy were observed in 13.3% of the cases (most frequently; gastrointestinal intolerance in 53.3% and hepatitis in 40%), however, there was no necessity to quit the therapy. Surgical treatment has been applied in 14 (12.4%) of the patients. As a result, the investigation of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of extrapulmonary tuberculosis on the large series of cases may be essential for early diagnosis and treatment in endemic countries such as Turkey."

This freedom has led to the application of radiosurgery to targets outside the brain. In this paper, we briefly review the technologies, treatment parameters, and clinical outcomes of radiosurgical treatment for spinal pathology, including metastatic tumors and rare but challenging lesions such as arteriovenous malformations and benign tumors. A special emphasis is put on the newest development, fiducial-less robotic radiosurgery. Spinal radiosurgery is associated with excellent rates of tumor control and pain relief with a good dose sparing of the highly sensitive spinal cord. Further research is required to optimize treatment strategies and to assess clinical benefits and toxicity in the long term."

CD008686,0,18809189,0,[Sciatica due to unusual causes: Tarlov cysts and nerve roots anomalies].,"Tarlov cysts and nerve roots anomalies usually involve lumbosacral roots and are often asymptomatic. MRI has enabled recognition of many conditions that used to be missed by CT or myelography investigations performed for back and leg pain. However, even without additional compressive impingement (disc hernia, spondylolisthesis or lumbar canal stenosis) these anomalies can be responsible for sciatica, motor deficit and bladder sphincter dysfunction. Tarlov cysts are perinervous dilatations of the dorsal root ganglion. CT and especially MRI can reveal these cysts and their precise relations with the neighboring structures. Delayed filling of the cysts can be visualized on the myelogram. MRI is more sensitive than CT myelography for a positive diagnosis of nerve root anomalies, a differential diagnosis with disc hernia and classification of these anomalies. Surgical treatment is indicated for symptomatic Tarlov cysts and nerve root anomalies resistant to conservative treatment. Better outcome is observed in patients with an additional compressive impingement component. We report two cases of sciatica: one caused by Tarlov cysts diagnosed by MRI and the other by nerve root anomalies diagnosed by CT myelography. In both cases, conservative treatment was undertaken. The clinical, radiological and therapeutic aspects of these disorders are discussed."
CD008686,0,18808067,0,Spinal cord compression through extraosseous extension of a vertebral low-grade hemangioendothelioma with histiocytoid differentiation.,"Herein, we report the case of a 47-year-old man clinically presenting a slow progressive loss of lower extremity functions within 8 weeks followed by an acute neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The patient exhibited high-grade paralysis of both legs with reduced sensation from dermatome Th11 downwards as well as marked spasticity of the lower extremity. Neuroradiological examinations revealed a protruding spinal tumor with extraosseous-intraspinal extension. The resected tumor mass exhibited a highly vascularized tumor with architectural complexity and high cellularity finally leading to the diagnosis of a hemangioendothelioma. Interesting was the fact that the tumor vasculature exhibited many CD68-positive cells protruding into the lumen and, therefore, being part of a partially histiocytoid differentiation which is all the more uncommon in hemangioendothelioma. The time frame of 3 hours between embolization and tumor resection is too short to explain a monocytic intravascular reaction. Usually, hemangioendotheliomas arise from the soft tissue, lungs or liver, but intraspinal manifestations are only rarely observed. Furthermore, the clinical course with a progressive development of a paraparesis due to a hemangioendothelioma is very uncommon."
CD008686,0,18806055,0,Ultra-low dose ketamine and memantine treatment for pain in an opioid-tolerant oncology patient.,"Patients taking high-dose opioids chronically for tumor-related or neuropathic pain may develop pain that is refractory to opioids. One option for control of such pain is the use of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine. We describe a case of opioid-refractory pain that responded to a low-dose IV infusion of ketamine in the inpatient setting. The patient was then successfully transitioned to oral memantine for long-term outpatient management, in a novel use of this oral NMDA receptor antagonist. We present recent findings from basic research on pain mechanisms to explain why opioid tolerance, as in this patient, may contribute to the analgesic benefit of NMDA receptor antagonists."

The cases include lumbar radicular herpes zoster, lumbar nerve root schwannoma, lumbar instability, facet hypertrophy, ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, sciatic neuritis, piriformis syndrome, intrapelvic mass and coxarthrosis. The pain pattern and accompanying symptoms were the major factors suggesting a non-discogenic etiology. Pelvic MRI and CT scans, and sciatic nerve magnetic resonance neurography were the main diagnostic tools for diagnosis of NDS. The treatment of choice depended on the primary diagnosis. Detailed physical examinations with special attention paid to the extraspinal causes of sciatica and to pain characteristics are the major components of differential diagnosis of NDS."
CD008686,0,18786842,0,Prostate cancer in dogs: comparative and clinical aspects.,"The canine prostate gland shares many morphological and functional similarities with the human prostate and dogs are the only other large mammals that commonly develop spontaneous prostate cancer. However, the incidence of prostate cancer is much lower in dogs and the precise cell of origin is not known. Dogs with prostate cancer usually present with advanced disease that does not respond to androgen deprivation therapy. Similar to humans, affected dogs often develop osteoblastic bone metastases in the pelvis and/or lumbar spine with associated pain and neurological deficits. Other clinical signs include weight loss, lethargy, and abnormal urination and/or defecation. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation have been used to treat dogs with prostate cancer, but success has been limited by the location and aggressive nature of the disease. It is evident that better methods of early detection and more effective therapies are needed for prostate cancer in dogs and advanced prostate carcinoma in men. Dogs with naturally-occurring prostate cancer are relevant models for the disease in humans and pre-clinical studies of new diagnostics and therapies in dogs may benefit both humans and dogs with prostate cancer."

Since other infectious diseases such as berylliosis, mycobacterium and fungal infections may present with a noncaseating granulomas, histological diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made using the elimination method. Central nervous system manifestations of sarcoidosis may be present in 5-10% of the cases involving cranial nerves, leptomeninges and third ventricle respectively. Any part of the central nervous system can be affected. Involvement of spinal cord in sarcoidosis is extremely rare and presents with only 0.3-0.4% in patients with systemic sarcoidosis. Intramedullary sarcoidosis is a rare first manifestation of the disease and it can mimic an intramedullary tumor, which is often manifested with symptoms that initiate from spinal cord compression, resulting in paraparesis, sensory disorders and sphincter dysfunction. We present a case of intramedullary sarcoidosis that mimics a tumor of the thoracic spinal cord. Clinical features, neuroradiological, pathohistological findings, laboratory analysis and surgical treatment of such a rare entity are being discussed."

CD008686,0,18751740,0,Modic changes: a systematic review of the literature.,"Modic changes (MC) are a common phenomenon on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in spinal degenerative diseases and strongly linked with low back pain (LBP). Histology, radiology, potential mechanisms, natural history and clinical studies of MC has formed the foundation on which our understanding of spinal degenerative diseases is built. The objective of this study was to provide a review of recent important advances in the study of MC and their clinical significance. This review article summarizes these studies, by delineating the possible mechanisms, and raising doubts and new questions. The related aspects such as discography and differential diagnosis with spinal infection and tumor on MRI are also discussed. Although most of researchers believe that MC are common findings in patients with spinal degenerative diseases and have an association with discogenic LBP, different results between studies may be produced from the differences in study design, inclusion criteria, and sample size. How the present knowledge of MC affects the management of spinal degenerative diseases remains unclear. Further studies of MC will explore therapeutic possibilities for future treatments of spinal degenerative diseases."
CD008686,0,18720727,0,[Neuromodulation--controlled analgesia. Criteria for long efficiency].,"In the past three decades, there have been cardinal changes in the surgical treatment of chronic pain syndromes. The early used destructive methods have been mostly substituted for surgical neuromodulation techniques. These include: (1) neurostimulation--the electric stimulation (ES) of peripheral nerves, the spinal cord, and brain; (2) intrathecal drug delivery by means of programmed pumps. Neurostimulation techniques are more frequently used in the treatment of no-cancer pain syndromes. Neurostimulation techniques are more frequently used in the treatment of no-cancer pain syndromes. Detailed analysis of our results showed that negative results and all cases with negative changes in follow-up were noted chiefly in patients with obvious and serious deafferentation signs. Testing ES is a major predictor of effectiveness for MCS. Positive results of chronic ES are observed in the vast majority of patients having good results in the postoperative testing period. Contrary to the current opinion as to worse follow-up results of chronic ES, we have seen positive changes in 5 patients followed up for about 3 years. Thus, by taking into account the high efficiency and minimal invasiveness of neurostimulation, no serious complications, as well as a possibility of improving the effectiveness of ES in a follow-up, this technique may be used as one of the first stages of surgical treatment of patients with neurogenic pain syndrome."

CD008686,0,18717513,0,Ketamine for acute and subacute pain in opioid-tolerant patients.,"Prolonged acute pain, especially that of oncologic neurological origin, is at times difficult to control; it is seldom entirely alleviated by opioids. We report eight patients with severe pain, three of whom suffered from new onset oncologic metastatic bone pain, others had previous pain syndromes and presented with exacerbation of pain. Pain was associated with hyperalgesia and allodynia phenomena in two patients and with phantom pain in a third one. Tolerance to opioids had developed, and high IV doses of morphine, meperidine or fentanyl, and patient-controlled intravenous and epidural analgesia were insufficient. Several patients became dependent on opioids and could not be weaned from assisted ventilation. Pain was controlled with decreasing adjunct doses of ketamine. Within 5-10 days of ketamine and opioid protocols, pain was controlled and after an additional 5-7 days, ketamine could be stopped and pain controlled on oral regimens compatible with outpatient care. Ketamine is an efficient adjuvant analgesic for intractable severe pain, caused by metastasis, trauma, chronic ischemia, or central neuropathic pain. It is effective even when mega doses of IV, epidural, or oral opioids prove ineffective and when signs of tolerance have developed."
CD008686,0,18716504,0,Anterolateral percutaneous vertebroplasty at C2 for lung cancer metastasis and upper cervical facet joint block.,"Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) of the axis (C2) is less aggressive than any surgical stabilizing procedure for the upper cervical spine, and it does not restrict the mobility of the upper cervical joints. Disruption of the weight-bearing unit of the second cervical (C2) vertebral body causes excessive load at the relatively small adjacent upper cervical joints. Upper cervical joint block before or after PVP at the C2 level has not been reported thus far. A 67-year-old man was referred to a pain clinic with a 6-month history of increasing neck pain without focal neurologic symptoms. Studies revealed a compression fracture of the C2 vertebral body and invasion of the adjacent soft tissue. To treat the mechanical component of the symptoms, anterolateral PVP at C2 was successfully performed, but the residual suboccipital headache was alleviated only after upper cervical joint block was performed. Thus, upper cervical joint block can be performed to treat the residual suboccipital headache after PVP at C2."

In three patients there was another indication. A 44-year-old woman suffering from vertebral pain due to an osteolytic lesion caused by multiple myeloma was treated with vertebroplasty of 4 vertebral levels. A 60-year-old woman with progressive complaints of back pain due to an aggressive vertebral haemangioma was treated with vertebroplasty after embolisation had only been partially successful. Lastly, a 50-year-old non-osteoporotic man with back pain persisting for six weeks due to a stable traumatic burst fracture of TIX could not be treated with standard care, i.e. corset and analgesics, because of obesity. He was treated with PVP after a cavity had been created in the vertebral corpus. Vertebroplasty is a minimal invasive procedure resulting in most patients in rapid diminishment of the pain caused by pathological vertebral fractures, which may be present for a longer period and may have different causes. The indication triad for vertebroplasty consists of localised back pain, pain when pressure is applied to the processus spinosus of the fractured level and MRI bone oedema, findings suggestive of microfractures in a pathologically changed vertebral body. The procedure is also suitable in patients with extensive comorbidity or a short life expectancy."

Physical examination showed marked edema in the labia majora, multiple hyperkeratotic papules in the left labium majus, and erythema, induration, and swelling in the left femoral and inguinal regions. A soft tumor that exhibited sinus tracts was palpated in the left gluteus. Excision of the gluteal tumor revealed a teratoma.

CD008686,0,18689435,0,Autologous olfactory ensheathing cell transplantation in human paraplegia: a 3-year clinical trial.,"Olfactory ensheathing cells show promise in preclinical animal models as a cell transplantation therapy for repair of the injured spinal cord. This is a report of a clinical trial of autologous transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells into the spinal cord in six patients with complete, thoracic paraplegia. We previously reported on the methods of surgery and transplantation and the safety aspects of the trial 1 year after transplantation. Here we address the overall design of the trial and the safety of the procedure, assessed during a period of 3 years following the transplantation surgery. All patients were assessed at entry into the trial and regularly during the period of the trial. Clinical assessments included medical, psychosocial, radiological and neurological, as well as specialized tests of neurological and functional deficits (standard American Spinal Injury Association and Functional Independence Measure assessments). Quantitative test included neurophysiological tests of sensory and motor function below the level of injury. The trial was a Phase I/IIa design whose main aim was to test the feasibility and safety of transplantation of autologous olfactory ensheathing cells into the injured spinal cord in human paraplegia. The design included a control group who did not receive surgery, otherwise closely matched to the transplant recipient group. This group acted as a control for the assessors, who were blind to the treatment status of the patients. The control group also provided the opportunity for preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the transplantation. There were no adverse findings 3 years after autologous transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells into spinal cords injured at least 2 years prior to transplantation. The magnetic resonance images (MRIs) at 3 years showed no change from preoperative MRIs or intervening MRIs at 1 and 2 years, with no evidence of any tumour of introduced cells and no development of post-traumatic syringomyelia or other adverse radiological findings. There were no significant functional changes in any patients and no neuropathic pain. In one transplant recipient, there was an improvement over 3 segments in light touch and pin prick sensitivity bilaterally, anteriorly and posteriorly. We conclude that transplantation of autologous olfactory ensheathing cells into the injured spinal cord is feasible and is safe up to 3 years of post-implantation, however, this conclusion should be considered preliminary because of the small number of trial patients."
CD008686,0,18688056,0,Evidence-based standards for cancer pain management.,"High-quality management of cancer pain depends on evidence-based standards for screening, assessment, treatment, and follow-up for general cancer pain and specific pain syndromes. We developed a set of standards through an iterative process of structured literature review and development and refinement of topic areas and standards and subjected recommendations to rating by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Providers should routinely screen for the presence or absence and intensity of pain and should perform descriptive pain assessment for patients with a positive screen, including assessment for likely etiology and functional impairment. For treatment, providers should provide pain education, offer breakthrough opioids in patients receiving long-acting formulations, offer bowel regimens in patients receiving opioids chronically, and ensure continuity of opioid doses across health care settings. Providers should also follow up on patients after treatment for pain. For metastatic bone pain, providers should offer single-fraction radiotherapy as an option when offering radiation, unless there is a contraindication. When spinal cord compression is suspected, providers should treat with corticosteroids and evaluate with whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging scan or myelography as soon as possible but within 24 hours. Providers should initiate definitive treatment (radiotherapy or surgical decompression) within 24 hours for diagnosed cord compression and should follow up on patients after treatment. These standards provide an initial framework for high-quality evidence-based management of general cancer pain and pain syndromes."

The effects of MSCC can range from minor sensory, motor and autonomic changes to severe pain, and complete paralysis that significantly affects the remainder of a patient's quality of life. When caught early, the symptoms of MSCC can be prevented, minimised or possibly reversed. However, failure to recognise the condition and its serious nature, together with limited awareness of the importance of early referral for treatment, can result in irreversible paralysis. Therefore, it is essential that nurses providing clinical care for these at-risk patients are able to identify early symptoms, and undertake a thorough patient history and examination; educating the patient and their family about the signs and symptoms of MSCC that need to be reported as soon as they occur."

This is a case report about the endoscopic appearance of a DLBCL with infiltration to the stomach in a 39-year-old female. She had a 6-mo history of lumbar and left upper quadrant pain with intermittent episodes of melena. A computer tomograghy (CT) scan showed mural thickening of the gastric antrum. Endoscopic examination revealed multiple gastric ulcers. Definite diagnosis could be made by endoscopic biopsies and the patient had a good response to chemotherapy. This response correlated well with a further endoscopic follow-up. A follow-up endoscopic examination could be considered to evaluate a good response to chemotherapy in DLBCL patients with secondary gastric dissemination.

These cases illustrate the heterogeneity and complexity of MUS in elderly patients, which requires broad, multidisciplinary clinical examination by a geriatrician, psychiatrist and psychologist. The first patient presented with persistent pain in the lower back and legs. Examination revealed a spinal stenosis, which was treated surgically; symptoms subsequently resolved. The second patient had chronic abdominal pain and constipation in combination with depression. She was diagnosed with a severe depressive disorder. After adequate drug treatment, her mood improved and the somatic symptoms disappeared. The third patient complained of headache and feared that she may have a brain tumour. There was no somatic diagnosis. She underwent cognitive behavioural group therapy, which substantially improved her functioning. These cases illustrate the diversity and complexity of MUS in elderly patients and underscore the diagnostic appropriateness of the biopsychosocial paradigm. A specialised multidisciplinary examination ensures accurate diagnosis and cognitive behavioural therapy."

Opioids such as Fentanyl is commonly added to local anesthetics to produce spinal and epidural anesthesia. However, significant adverse effects, such as pruritus, respiratory depression, hemodynamic instability and occasionally severe nausea and vomiting, may limit their use. Our present study was designed to assess the effectiveness of using combined intrathecal and epidural magnesium (Mg) in reducing intra-and postoperative analgesic requirements and improving the quality of analgesia."
CD008686,0,18636051,0,Five-level one-piece laminoplasty for extensive tumors of the lumbar spine.,"The authors describe the surgical method and results of nonexpansive one-piece multivel laminoplasty of the whole lumbar spine, for microsurgical resection of extensive spinal tumors. This technique allows a very comfortable approach to the dura and intradural content, as well as a perfect replacement of the posterior spinal arch with supporting elements and an optimal reconstruction of the spinal anatomy. A nonexpansive whole lumbar one-piece laminoplasty was performed for resection of extensive multilevel lumbar tumors. The authors report an illustrative case of a patient who initially presented with a three-year history of numbness on both legs and progressive difficulty in walking. Two months before admission, he complained of bilateral sciatica and rectourinary dysfunction. A spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented an intradural tumor extending from L2 to S1. The patient underwent a nonexpansive whole lumbar one-piece laminoplasty and microsurgical removal of the intradural lesion. The postoperative course was uneventful, the sensory disturbances and bilateral sciatica early recovered while rectourinary disturbance gradually improved up to a complete resolution at one year follow-up. The authors believe that multilevel laminoplasty rather than laminectomy is the technique of choice as a posterior procedure for extensive lumbar spinal tumors. With this technique, it is possible to obtain a very confortable approach to the dura and intradural content, as well as a perfect replacement of the posterior spinal arch with supporting elements and an optimal reconstruction of the normal spine. Moreover, this method prevents postoperative instability and deformity and avoids the so called post-laminectomy epidural membrane."
CD008686,0,18632791,0,Modulation of bladder function by prostaglandin EP3 receptors in the central nervous system.,"Prostaglandin EP3 receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) may exert an excitatory effect on urinary bladder function via modulation of bladder afferent pathways. We have studied this action, using two EP3 antagonists, (2E)-3-{1-[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl]-5-fluoro-3-methyl-1H-indol-7-yl}-N-[(4,5-dichloro-2-thienyl)sulfonyl]-2-propenamide (DG041) and (2E)-N-{[5-bromo-2-(methyloxy)phenyl] sulfonyl}-3-[2-(2-naphthalenylmethyl)phenyl]-2-propenamide (CM9). DG041 and CM9 were proven to be selective EP3 antagonists with radioligand binding and functional fluorescent imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assays. Their effects on volume-induced rhythmic bladder contraction and the visceromotor reflex (VMR) response to urinary bladder distension (UBD) were evaluated in female rats after intrathecal or intracerebroventricular administration. Both DG041 and CM9 showed a high affinity for EP3 receptors at subnanomolar concentrations without significant selectivity for any splice variants. At the human EP3C receptor, both inhibited calcium influx produced by the nonselective agonist PGE2. After intrathecal or intracerebroventricular administration both CM9 and DG041 dose-dependently reduced the frequency, but not the amplitude, of the bladder rhythmic contraction. With intrathecal administration DG041 and CM9 produced a long-lasting and robust inhibition on the VMR response to UBD, whereas with intracerebroventricular injection both compounds elicited only a transient reduction of the VMR response to bladder distension. These data support the concept that EP3 receptors are involved in bladder micturition at supraspinal and spinal centers and in bladder nociception at the spinal cord. A centrally acting EP3 receptor antagonist may be useful in the control of detrusor overactivity and/or pain associated with bladder disorders."

CD008686,0,18628179,0,Survival-adjusted multiple-event analysis for the evaluation of treatment effects of zoledronic Acid in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.,"Bone metastasis causes significant pain and morbidity and is characterized by multiple skeletal-related events (SREs), including fractures, spinal cord compression, and the requirement for radiation or surgery to bone. Analysis of such a composite endpoint provides insight into the clinical impact of the disease. However, SREs typically occur in a complex pattern. Recently, zoledronic acid (4 mg) was approved for the treatment of bone metastases secondary to all solid tumors and primary bone lesions from multiple myeloma based on significant benefits from first-event and skeletal morbidity rate analyses. However, multiple-event methods can provide information about the risk of SREs over the entire course of follow-up and address interpatient variation in event rates and temporal trends. Moreover, multiple-event methodology can adjust for survival, which has an effect on SRE incidence. Herein we present a survival-adjusted multiple-event analysis of the cumulative incidence of radiation to bone (a homogenous endpoint) and SREs (a composite endpoint) in 3 large, randomized clinical trials of zoledronic acid (4 mg) in patients with prostate cancer, lung cancer and other solid tumors, or breast cancer. In patients with prostate cancer, zoledronic acid significantly reduced the cumulative incidence of SREs compared with placebo (P = 0.002) as it did among patients with lung cancer and other solid tumors (P = 0.025). In patients with breast cancer, zoledronic acid significantly reduced the cumulative incidence of SREs compared with pamidronate 90 mg over 25 months (P = 0.050). These results are consistent with those obtained using established methods, supporting the validity of the survival-adjusted cumulative mean function for assessing benefits during bisphosphonate therapy."
CD008686,0,18628140,0,What is the evidence for implantable drug delivery systems for refractory cancer pain?,"Despite best management, 14% of patients with cancer have unrelieved pain and many more have undesirable side effects from pain medicines. Intrathecal implantable drug delivery systems (IDDSs) manage intractable cancer pain by delivering pain medications directly to the spinal fluid. In addition to data from many nonrandomized trials, there are now randomized clinical trial data showing better clinical success, pain relief, drug toxicity control, and perhaps survival compared with comprehensive medical management (CMM). We reviewed published cohort reports from 1980 through 2003 using Medline. We studied 202 patients with unrelieved pain on visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores of >/= 5 on a scale of 0-10 despite conventional management. The main outcome measure was clinical success, defined as a 20% improvement in pain control and composite drug toxicity. We ranked the trials according to accepted levels of evidence. The nonrandomized trials all showed pain relief with acceptable complication rates, but often did not have standardized assessment schemas, had no control groups, and were single-institutional trials. In the randomized trial, more patients had clinical success with IDDS (84.5%) than with CMM (70.5%, P < 0.05). After 4 weeks, the mean VAS pain score decreased from the baseline of 7.75 to 4.74 (39% reduction) in the CMM group and from 7.45 to 3.59 (52% reduction) in the IDDS group (P = 0.057). The drug toxicity scores decreased from the baseline of 6.35 to 5.18 (19% reduction) in the CMM group and from 7.14 to 3.46 (52% reduction) in the IDDS group (P = 0.01). All individual toxicities were improved more by IDDS, especially fatigue and depressed level of consciousness. Patients randomized to IDDS therapy had improved survival, with 53.9% alive at 6 months compared with 37.2% of the CMM group (P = 0.06). There is now high-level randomized clinical trial evidence, in addition to consistent nonrandomized evidence, that IDDSs reduce pain and common drug toxicities and are associated with improved survival. Added to the multiple cohort studies, the evidence is compelling in favor of IDDS."

To prospectively assess the long-term efficacy and safety of BKP in treating thoracic and lumbar spinal metastatic fractures that result in pain or instability. Sixty-five patients (37 men, mean age: 66 years) underwent 99 BKP procedures. Patient-related outcomes of pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index were assessed pre- and post-operatively and after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Correction of vertebral height and kyphotic deformity were assessed by radiographic measurements. Mean pain VAS and Oswestry Disability Index significantly improved from pre- to post-treatment (P < 0.0001), this improvement being sustained up to 24-month follow up. A gain in height restoration and a reduction of the post-operative kyphotic angle were seen post-operatively and at 3 months although these radiographic outcomes returned to pre-operative levels at 12 months. BKP was associated with a rate of cement leakage and incidence vertebral fracture of 12 and 8%, respectively. No symptomatic cement leaks or serious adverse events were seen during the 24 months of follow up. BKP is a minimally invasive procedure that provides immediate and long-term pain relief and improvement in functional ability in selected patients with metastatic VCFs. The procedure appears to have good long-term safety."
CD008686,0,18551568,0,Contemporary role of suprapubic cystostomy in treatment of neuropathic bladder dysfunction in spinal cord injured patients.,"The management of neuropathic bladder dysfunction secondary to spinal cord injury is controversial. With the introduction of clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and anti-cholinergic medication, urinary tract deterioration in this population has declined. Nevertheless, this strategy is problematic for patients who are unable to perform CIC. Suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) is widely viewed as a secondary option, which has a high satisfaction rating among patients, with acceptable clinical efficacy. Despite early reports of long-term renal and bladder complications, recent evidence has demonstrated that improved anti-cholinergic pharmacotherapy and bladder maintenance strategies can enhance SPC efficacy, with diminished morbidity. We set out to review the current literature on SPC in the neuropathic bladder setting and to clarify future management direction."
CD008686,0,18549135,0,[Diagnosis and treatment of patients with spinal epidural metastases].,"Three patients with a medical history of malignancy were referred for back pain: two women aged 53 and 43 years respectively, with breast cancer, and a woman of 85 years with rectal carcinoma. All patients suffered from spinal metastasis. Considerable delay occurred between the initial complaint of back pain and the diagnosis. This adversely influenced the outcome after treatment. A reliable differentiation, based on symptoms and signs, between widely occurring non-malignant back pain and back pain due to spinal metastasis is impossible. This confronts physicians with the dilemma of overexposing their patients to diagnostic tests on the one hand and the risk of missing an important diagnosis on the other. Early recognition of warning signs, i.e. previous medical history of malignancy, onset of back pain above 50 years of age, continuous pain not related to posture or movement and nocturnal pain, should alert physicians."
CD008686,0,18543508,0,[Discrepancy between clinical and radiologic manifestations of an epidural hematoma after catheterization].,"Neuraxial techniques are considered safe if certain guidelines are followed, but they are not risk free. We report the case of an 81-year-old woman with an invasive bladder tumor who underwent radical cystectomy with a Bricker-type procedure. General anesthesia was used and epidural analgesia was also provided for surgical and postoperative pain management. Late in the postoperative recovery period a large epidural hematoma was diagnosed based on radiologic signs of spinal cord compression, in the absence of symptoms other than mild and progressive back pain that developed after extubation. The surgeon decided against emergency surgery to reduce compression. Symptoms resolved gradually, and a magnetic resonance image 45 days after discharge confirmed that the hematoma was smaller. In addition to the usual safety recommendations for epidural anesthesia with regard to drugs that alter hemostasis, it is important to bear in mind circumstances that have pharmacokinetic repercussions and that increase risk. Lower back pain can be a warning sign. Some cases may resolve spontaneously."
CD008686,0,18542765,0,Malignant spinal cord compression secondary to testicular seminoma at the time of initial presentation and at relapse while on surveillance.,"We report cases of 2 pure seminoma patients who developed metastatic spinal cord compressions. One patient was diagnosed at age 33 years with stage 1 seminoma and, after undergoing an orchidectomy, chose to be followed on a surveillance protocol. He was lost to follow-up and presented again 22 months later with back pain, leg weakness and sensory loss when his disease recurred as a spinal cord compression. He was treated with urgent surgical decompression and subsequent standard chemotherapy. More than 2 years posttreatment, he is disease-free with normal neurologic function in his lower extremities. The second patient presented at age 44 years with back pain and rapid loss of leg strength and sensation. Investigations revealed a malignant cord compression with lymphatic and vertebral body metastases. On physical examination, the patient was found to have a 6-cm left testicular mass. He was treated with emergency radiotherapy to the region of his cord compression followed by a left inguinal orchidectomy. Pathology confirmed a pure classic seminoma. Postoperatively, he received standard chemotherapy and eventually regained neurologic function in his legs. Although it is rare for malignant spinal cord compression to occur in seminoma patients-either as the initial presentation of disease or as a site of disease recurrence in stage 1 patients on surveillance-it is crucial to consider seminoma as a possible etiology in young men diagnosed with malignant spinal cord compression because timely contemporary treatments for seminoma will cure most of these patients and offer them excellent functional recovery."

The intervals from onset of the initial symptoms to diagnosis using MRI for cervical, thoracic, and lumbar tumors were 16.9, 16.8 and 8.1 months, respectively. Of the 20 patients with thoracic spine tumors, 10 had been examined with MRI at an incorrect level. The patients with cervical tumors tended to have delayed diagnoses due to the time taken before visiting a physician. Tumors in the thoracic spine were missed because the symptoms were similar to more common degenerative lumbar disorders and the absence of proper MRI screening. The possibility of thoracic spinal tumor should be kept in mind when unexplained low back pain persists in response to various treatments."
CD008686,0,18537651,0,Treatment of central nervous system involvement associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome.,"Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that mainly affects the exocrine glands and usually presents with sicca symptoms of the main mucosal surfaces. The prevalence and the type of central nervous system (CNS) tissue damage caused by SS are debatable. The wide spectrum of CNS manifestations, different classification criteria used and unclear inclusion or exclusion criteria pose some difficulty reviewing these studies. Careful examination of the SS patients and to be aware of neurological findings which may be associated with suspicious CNS involvement is highly important. Central nervous system may also hypothetically have a role in the pathophysiology of SS. The wide spectrum of CNS involvement includes focal (sensorial and motor deficits, brain stem, cerebellar lesions, seizure, migraine etc.) or non-focal (encephalomyelitis, aseptic meningitis, neuropsychiatric dysfunctions), spinal cord (myelopathy, transverse myelitis, motor neuron disease etc.) findings or multiple sclerosis-like illness and optic neuritis. Evolving imaging techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance spectroscopy or magnetization transfer imaging are promising for better understanding the nature of CNS involvement in SS. Treatments usually comprise symptomatic approach in milder cases however, pulse cyclophosphamide and steroids or other immunosuppressants (chlorambucil or azathioprine) are required in cases with progressive symptoms leading to neurological impairment. Anti-TNF agents (infliximab and etanercept) and B cell targeted therapies (rituximab and epratuzumab) are used in primary SS however their efficacy on CNS manifestation is still unclear. Randomized, multicenter studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy of treatment regimes which were reported to be effective in anecdotal reports or in small uncontrolled series. This article reviews the clinical approach to current therapy of CNS involvement in patients with primary SS."

The diagnostic stake in front of an acute low back pain is not to ignore a condition requiring a specific treatment (vertebral fracture, tumours, infections, inflammatory diseases...). Signs of alerts from patient history are to be looked for to enable it. Once the diagnosis of non specific low back pain has been confirmed and in absence of neurological complications, the therapeutic stake is to avoid chronicity by a treatment adapted to every patient. Numerous scientific quality data questioned the interest of the bed rest for non specific acute low back pain and the beneficial role of the preservation of the activities to avoid chronicity.

The initial clinical history taking should aim at identifying ""red flags"", associated with a higher risk of serious disorders. Rapid MRI of the spine should be performed in order to make a specific diagnosis. In chronic LBP, X-rays of the spine are always performed, first to rule out underlying specific diagnosis, then to describe degenerative spine changes. At MRI and X-rays, most of degenerative disc abnormalities are non-specific, frequently found in the asymptomatic subjects. On fat-suppressed T2WI, edema of endplates in degenerative disc disease and of posterior arches in facet arthropathy and spondylolysis is well-correlated to LBP.

CD008686,0,18516976,0,[On the occasion of my retirement as head of the Neurochirurgische Universitätsklinik Zürich--changing aspects of treatment modality in modern neurosurgery and of neuroscience research. Presentation of our experience and historical backgrounds].,"On the occasion of my retirement as head of the Neurochirurgische Universitätsklinik Zürich on 31. May 2007, the changing aspects of neurosurgery in diseases dealt with and in their treatments during the last 70 years (from the foundation of the department by Prof. Krayenbuehl in 1937 successed by Prof. Yaşargil and later on by myself.) were presented. Number of surgical procedures were 1,000 times per year during the interval and the busiest era was that of Prof. Krayenbühl, in which it amounted to as much as 1,500 at the maximum. Lumbar disc surgery was the most frequent one (around 250/year with the use of more than 70 beds) and this belonged to the beginning of the resident's surgical training program. This is now mainly performed by neurosurgeons in practice outside of the university hospital. Although ""new"" technique such as Chymopapain injection or endoscopic methods have been applied, microsurgical lumbar disc surgery remains as the gold standard. Newly the situation of medical economics has changed dramatically. One is forced to adapt oneself more or less to this change, so that these 1,000 surgeries/year could be performed using 30 beds. Vascular neurosurgery has changed considerably in its aspects from development of microsurgery pioneered by Prof. Yaşargil at the end of 1960 and to the endovascular methods by Serbinenco, Grüntzig in 1970s followed by Guglielmi's electrothrombosis at the end of 1980. Our cases of aneurysm clipping decreased from 100 (1993) to 80 (2006), while cases of aneurysm coiling increased from 40 (1993) to 60 (2006). Long-term follow-up results of endovascular methods are still to be evaluated for the final judgement of appropriateness of this tendency. AVMs are now mainly treated with endovascular method (70/year) and their microsurgical removal of AVMs is usually performed in combination with hematoma removal in the acute stage (20/year). Gamma-knife application for AVMs were rare. Traditionally, carotid endarterectomy belonged to vascular surgeons in our hospital, but the tendency of conversion from conventional carotid endarterectomy to endovascular PTA and/or stenting seemed to be marked, while microvascular revascularization procedure represented by extracranial intracranial EC-IC bypass remained constant (around 20/year) in various occasion (277 times on 203 cases: atherosclerosis 93, Moyamoya angiopathy (MMA) 47, aneurysm 57 and skull base tumour 6, during the last 13 years], in spite of negative results of EC-IC bypass international cooperative study for stroke prevention in 1985. Glioma surgery especially glioblastoma surgery the most frequent surgery in our department around 170 / year contributed to improvement of both life expectancy and quality of life by development of therapy modalities (irradiation microsurgery and chemotherapy). Recent life expectancy of cases with primary glioblastoma amounted to 25.8 ms on the average by combination of treatments; microsurgical gross total removal + irradiation + temodal and thalidomide. This was 8.5 ms and 14 ms respectively at the time of Prof. Krayenbühl 1960 (surgical removal plus irradiation) and of Prof. Yaşargil 1970 (microsurgical removal plus irradiation) and these results being those on cases of primary and secondary glioblastoma together. Postoperative quality of life improved also by using modern techniques: intraoperative stimulation, cortical mapping, navigation, open MRI etc.. Acoustic neurinoma (just less than 20/year) is one of benign brain tumours whose treatment has changed remarkably. Cases were referred to us only when their size exceeded 2-3 cm in extrameatal diameter, as the smaller ones are treated by Gamma-knife. Thanks to development of intaroperative neurophysiological monitoring and of surgical technique, preservation of facial nerve function has improved from 60% to more than 85% in spite of the increase of size. Functional neurosurgery represented by microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm and trigeminal neuralgia pioneered by Prof. Jannetta and by the selective amgdalohippocampectomy SAHE for intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy MTLE pioneered by Prof. Yaşargil both in 1970s were around 20/year respectively. Recently stereotactic intervention decreased remarkably. Shunting procedure for hydrocephalus malresorptivus (after subarachnoid hemorrhage and/or idiopathic) were around 100/year. Programmable valve (opening pressure can be changed magnetically percutaneously) has increased clinical effectiveness of the shunt. It was the authors pleasure to have succeeded the Neurochirurgische Universitätsklinik Zürich directed by two foregoing giant neurosurgeons Prof. Krayenbühl and Prof. Yaşargil and therefore to have completed a hard task more or less and have experienced considerable changing aspects of modern neurosurgery as mentioned above."
CD008686,0,18516006,0,A case of primary hepatic Burkitt's lymphoma.,"Burkitt's lymphoma is a rare disease that belongs to the aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Herein, we report a case of primary hepatic Burkitt's lymphoma. A 19-year-old man visited the hospital for right upper quadrant pain. He felt fatigue for two months. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly and no palpable lymph node. He had no fever, weight loss, or night sweating. Laboratory finding showed mild anemia (hemoglobin, 12.4 g/dL), mild elevated transaminase (ALT, 52 IU/L), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 437 IU/L), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP, 129 IU/L). The viral marker was positive for HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc (IgG), and negative for anti-HBe, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV. CEA, AFP, and CA19-9 levels were within normal ranges. The HBV DNA quantitation was 1.3 x 10(9) copies/ml. Abdominal-Pelvis CT scan and abdominal MRI finding were compatible with malignant lymphoma. Liver biopsy examination confirmed Burkitt's lymphoma. No metastasis was detected in the thoracic cavity, bone marrow, and spinal fluid. The patient was treated with the combination regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone and high dose methotrexate. Cytosine arabinoside and methotrexate were added for CNS prophylaxis by intrathecal installation. Chemotherapy was administered every 3 weeks for fifteen cycles. Serial follow-up CT scan showed a marked decrease in the size of hepatic lesions. Follow-up CT scan and PET-CT scan were performed 4 weeks after the final cycle disclosed no definite residual or active lesion confirming the state of complete remission."
CD008686,0,18515241,0,Management of adult patients receiving intraventricular chemotherapy for the treatment of leptomeningeal metastasis.,"Cancer in the central nervous system can arise from a primary brain tumor and metastasize to the brain or to the leptomeninges, leading to leptomeningeal metastasis (LM). LM also is called leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and carcinomatous meningitis. When LM occurs, signs and symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, lumbar back pain, and stiff or painful neck; LM also may lead to mental disturbances and seizures. Nursing care of patients with LM requires an understanding of neurologic anatomy and physiology, along with associated treatments and complications. Treatment of LM may involve intrathecal or, more likely, intraventricular chemotherapy. Very little has been written about appropriate care of patients with LM. The purpose of this article is to review the literature, summarize clinical care recommendations, and construct evidence-based guidelines for the administration of intraventricular chemotherapy and the care and monitoring of patients with LM."

CD008686,0,18507943,0,Clinical study of a new approach to thoracolumbar surgery.,"The conventional approaches for treatment of thoracolumbar diseases require extensive surgical exposure, often leading to postoperative pain and morbidity. Thoracoscopic-assisted surgery in these regions usually requires an extended recovery period due to the placement of drainage. We developed an innovative retroperitoneal-extrapleural approach to thoracolumbar involvement by an extra-diaphragmatic technique using dedicated instruments. Neither incision nor reconstruction of the diaphragm was necessary. Exposure to the lateral part of the thoracolumbar vertebrae could be achieved without crus resection. This study is aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of this new surgical procedure."
CD008686,0,18503622,0,Alleviation of Pancoast's tumor pain by ultrasound-guided percutaneous ablation of cervical nerve roots.,"The case report describes use of real-time ultrasound guidance to facilitate percutaneous ablation of cervical nerve roots in a patient with Pancoast's syndrome. Distortion of anatomy by the tumor made it difficult to perform the procedure safely using fluoroscopy. A 64-year-old right-handed male patient with carcinoma of the left lung presented with severe pain in the left shoulder and the arm. A clinical diagnosis of the left brachial plexopathy secondary to tumor involvement of C5 to C8 nerve roots was made. Radiological appearance of the cervical spine revealed distorted anatomy because of severe degeneration of the cervical spine and guarding torticollis. Diagnostic prognostic block of the C4 to C7 exiting nerve roots was done under ultrasound guidance and resulted in more than 75% reduction in pain intensity for 4 hours. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cervical rhizotomy was performed later. At 3-month follow-up, the patient still had complete pain relief as well as improvement in quality of sleep. Ultrasound-guided cervical nerve roots ablation is a feasible approach for patients with intractable neuropathic pain secondary to Pancoast's tumor. It can be a useful alternative to fluoroscopy in patients in whom a fluoroscopy-guided approach is deemed difficult and hazardous."
CD008686,0,18500019,0,A giant cranial aneurysmal bone cyst associated with fibrous dysplasia.,"An aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is a rare, benign fibro-osseous lesion, considered a vascular phenomenon secondary to fibrous dysplasia or a giant-cell tumour, and occurs mainly in long bones and vertebrae. In this case report a 16-year-old male presented with massive epistaxis. He was admitted with a 3-year history of chronic rhinitis, headaches, right ocular pain and recurrent epistaxis. CT scans showed a predominantly cystic, expansive mass obstructing both nasal cavities, extending to all paranasal sinuses and both orbits, with evidence of anterior cranial fossa skull base destruction. The patient underwent a craniofacial resection of the tumour performed with an external approach and an immediate reconstruction of the dural defect. Histology confirmed the lesion was an ABC associated with fibrous dysplasia. The patient's recovery was complete. A large facial aneurysmal bone cyst can damage the facial skeleton and skull base, and requires excision by a combined external approach."

CD008686,0,18499527,0,Positional cervical spinal cord compression and fibromyalgia: a novel comorbidity with important diagnostic and treatment implications.,"The variable presentation and treatment response of fibromyalgia (FM) may be related to comorbidities, including positional cervical cord compression (PC3). Prevalence of PC3 among routine referrals for rheumatology consultation was assessed over 2 random months (January and February 2006) from a 4-year experience of 1100 patients. PC3 was defined as cord abutment, compression or flattening with a spinal canal diameter of <10 mm by magnetic resonance sagittal flexion, neutral, and extension images. Of 107 referrals, 53 had FM, 32 had a connective tissue disease (CTD) without FM, and 22 had chronic widespread pain (CWP) without FM criteria. The dynamic cervical spine images were obtained in 70 patients: 49 of 53 with FM, 20 of 22 with CWP and 1 of 32 with CTD, based on history and examination. Among those who received magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], 52 patients met PC3 criteria (71% of FM group [35/49], 85% of CWP group [17/20]). Two patients had a Chiari malformation (FM), 1 had multiple sclerosis (CWP), and 1 had multiple myeloma (CWP). Extension views were required for diagnosis for 37 of these 52 (71%) subjects, as well as for 8 patients who also had cervical spinal cord flattening. The pilot data suggest that further evaluation of PC3 in a controlled trial is warranted among patients with FM and CWP."
CD008686,0,18499080,0,Clinical characterization of neuroschistosomiasis due to Schistosoma mansoni and its treatment.,"The involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) by Schistosoma mansoni may or may not cause clinical manifestations. When symptomatic, neuroschistosomiasis mansoni (NSM) is one of the most severe presentations of this infection. The neurological manifestations are due to numerous granulomas grouped in confined areas of the spinal cord or the brain. Considering the symptomatic form, myelopathy is far more frequent than the cerebral disease. Spinal cord NSM presents as a low cord syndrome of acute/subacute progression usually associated with involvement of the cauda esquina roots. Lower limbs pain, weakness and sensory disturbance, and autonomic dysfunctions, particularly bladder dysfunction, are often present. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination generally shows an inflammatory pattern with or without eosinophils and/or IgG against schistosomal antigens. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates signs of inflammatory myelopathy. Cerebral NSM presents as a slow-expanding intracranial tumor-like lesion. Its clinical manifestations are variable and depend on the increased intracranial pressure and on the site of the lesion. The diagnosis of spinal cord NSM is based on clinical evidence whereas the cerebral disease is usually diagnosed by biopsy of the nervous tissue. There is no consensus on the treatment of NSM. We discuss the literature data on this topic, and suggest a therapeutic approach based on our experience with 69 spinal cord NSM patients who have been followed up by a long period of time. Outcome is largely dependent on early treatment, particularly in the medullar disorder, and is better in cerebral NSM."
CD008686,0,18496194,0,Radiosurgery for benign intradural spinal tumors.,The role of stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial benign tumors is well established.

CD008686,0,18495896,0,The investigation and management of back pain in children.,"Back pain in children and adolescents is probably much less common than in adults, but its true incidence is unknown. Although back pain has traditionally been considered a rare and often sinister presentation in the paediatric age group, recent literature now suggests that a relatively high number of children do experience back pain, but only a small proportion seek medical attention. For the majority of children with back pain no underlying cause is identified, but some require investigation to exclude serious underlying pathology. Laboratory and imaging investigations should be targeted towards those with ""red flag"" symptoms and signs. Imaging studies, particularly MRI, have an important role in diagnosis of underlying pathology such as infection or malignancy."

Radiological findings were normal with the exception of a cystic paravertebral tumor in the left retroperitoneum. The cyst was primarily regarded as a coincidental finding because no criteria for malignancy were present. Magnetic resonance tomography, however, the cyst showed a progressive increase in size and the pain remained unchanged so that surgical resection was performed. The histopathological examination showed a lymphangioma and the pain was nearly completely resolved after surgery."
CD008686,0,18471225,0,Three unusual neuropathologic-related causes of sudden death.,"We discuss the autopsy findings of three medico-legal cases of sudden death associated with uncommon neuropathologic findings of which the general forensic pathologist may not be familiar. Case 1 was a 43-year-old man who died of a seizure due to malignant melanoma of the temporal lobe associated with neurocutaneous melanosis (NCM). Case 2 was a 57-year-old woman with a history of mental retardation and incoordination because of chronic lead poisoning, who died of a pulmonary thromboembolism due to deep venous thrombosis status post left leg fracture after a fall down a staircase. Autopsy revealed atrophy and gliosis of her cerebellum as a result of childhood lead poisoning. The third patient was a 75-year-old woman who died as a result of acute bacterial leptomeningitis at the cervico-medullary junction with acute inflammation of the connective tissue of her upper cervical spinal column associated with subluxation of her atlantoaxial (AA) joint, also known as Grisel's syndrome."

CD008686,0,18456162,0,Clinical assessment of stereotactic IGRT: spinal radiosurgery.,"The role of stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial lesions is well established. Its use for the treatment of spinal lesions has been limited because of the availability of effective target immobilization devices. Recent advances in stereotactic IGRT have allowed for spinal applications. Large clinical experience with spinal radiosurgery to properly assess clinical outcomes has previously been limited. At our institution, we have developed a successful multidisciplinary spinal radiosurgery program in which 542 spinal lesions (486 malignant and 56 benign lesions) were treated with a single-fraction radiosurgery technique. Patient ages ranged from 18 to 85 years (mean 56 years). Lesion location included 92 cervical, 234 thoracic, 130 lumbar, and 86 sacral. The most common metastatic tumors were renal cell (89 cases), breast (74 cases), and lung (71 cases). The most common benign tumors were neurofibroma (24 cases), schwannoma (13 cases), and meningioma (7 cases). Eighty-nine cervical lesions were treated using skull tracking. Thoracic, lumbar, and sacral tumors were tracked relative to either gold or stainless steel fiducial markers. The maximum intratumoral dose ranged from 12.5 to 30 Gy (mean 20 Gy). Tumor volume ranged from 0.16 to 298 mL (mean 47 mL). Three hundred thirty-seven lesions had received prior external beam irradiation with spinal cord doses precluding further conventional irradiation. The primary indication for radiosurgery was pain in 326 cases, as a primary treatment modality in 70 cases, for tumor radiographic tumor progression in 65 cases, for post-surgical treatment in 38 cases, for progressive neurological deficit in 35 cases, and as a radiation boost in 8 cases. Follow-up period was at least 3 to 49 months. Axial and/or radicular pain improved in 300 of 326 cases (92%). Long-term tumor control was demonstrated in 90% of lesions treated with radiosurgery as a primary treatment modality and in 88% of lesions treated for radiographic tumor progression. Thirty of 35 patients (85%) with progressive neurological deficits experienced at least some improvement after treatment. Spinal stereotactic radiosurgery is now a feasible, safe, and clinically effective technique for the treatment of a variety of spinal lesions. The potential benefits of radiosurgical ablation of spinal lesions are short treatment time in an outpatient setting with essentially no recovery time and excellent symptomatic response. This technique offers a new therapeutic modality for the primary treatment of a variety of spinal lesions, including the treatment of neoplasms in medically inoperable patients, previously irradiated sites, for lesions not amenable to open surgical techniques, and as an adjunct to surgery."

CD008686,0,18453303,0,Unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with a solitary metastasis to the mandible.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to pose a worldwide burden on health resources with an occurrence of 1.4 million cases annually. It represents the fifth most common cancer in men and eighth most common in women worldwide. Eighty per cent of patients have a background cirrhotic liver, most commonly in the United States, resulting from chronic hepatitis C infection, whereas alcoholism also commonly contributes to the development of cirrhosis. Fifty per cent of patients diagnosed with HCC present with metastatic disease. Sites of metastasis commonly include the lungs, vertebral bones, and abdominal lymph nodes. Metastasis to the oral region is very rare. We report a 55-year-old man with metastatic HCC to the mandible. The patient was previously diagnosed with unresectable HCC and had undergone six cycles of chemoembolization therapy. Although the lesion remained stable in size, he did not qualify for liver transplantation because of active alcohol use. He presented to the emergency room for evaluation of recent-onset jaw pain. There was no history of trauma and an oral examination did not reveal any mucosal lesions. Mild swelling and tenderness of the right jaw was noted, and a subsequent CT scan revealed a right-sided mass centered around a fracture of the body of the mandible and surrounded by the masseter muscle. A biopsy of the mass revealed a metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis confirmed it to be a solitary metastasis. The patient underwent surgical resection of a segment of the right mandible and the metastatic tumor. He continues to receive regional chemoembolization and is currently pain-free. Solitary metastasis to the mandible in the setting of HCC is exceedingly rare. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the lesion with immunohistochemical analysis is useful in characterizing the lesion and identifying the primary site. Radiotherapy has been used to palliate mandibular metastases; however, surgical intervention proved to be very effective in managing this patient's disease."
CD008686,0,18444221,0,Osteoid osteoma of a cervical vertebral body.,"We report a very rare case of 5-year-old boy with osteoid osteoma of the cervical vertebral body. The patient presented with a 6-month history of neck pain with radiation into the shoulder and arm on the left side, which was relieved by ibuprofen. Neurological examination and plain radiographs of the cervical spine were normal. CT scan and bone scintigraphy, rather than MRI suggested the pathological diagnosis, which was confirmed on histological examination. The patient underwent excision of the lesion via an anterior approach with complete resolution of the pain postoperatively."
CD008686,0,18440778,0,Analysis of magnetic resonance imaging characteristics and pain in temporomandibular joints with and without degenerative changes of the condyle.,"The aim of this study was to investigate temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics in 104 TMJs with and 58 without degenerative changes of the condyle, such as osteophytes, erosion, avascular necrosis, subcondral cyst and intra-articular loose bodies. TMJ images were also assessed for flattening, retropositioning and hypomobility of condyle and disc displacement. Comparison of the TMJ side-related data showed a significant relationship between disc displacement without reduction (DDwoR) and the presence of degenerative bony changes (p=0.00). Flattening, retropositioning and hypomobility of condyle showed no significant difference in relation to the presence or absence of degenerative bony changes. Retropositioning of the condyle was significantly associated to disc displacement with reduction (DDwR) (p=0.00), while condylar hypomobility was significantly more frequent in TMJ with DDwoR (p<0.05). Independent of the presence or type of DD, TMJ pain was more frequent in the presence of degenerative bony changes. When considering only DDwR, TMJ pain was significantly associated to a degenerative condition (p=0.03). When there were no degenerative bony changes, TMJ pain was significantly more frequent in DDwoR (p=0.04). Despite the present findings, the absence of symptoms in some patients with condylar bony changes suggests that the diagnosis of osteoarthritis should be established by evaluation of magnetic resonance images in association with clinical examination."

CD008686,0,18432321,0,[Adult Scheuermann's disease as cause of mechanic dorsalgia].,"Scheuermann's disease (SD) or vertebral osteochondrosis is the most frequent cause of non postural kyphosis and one of more frequent cause of adolescent's dorsalgia. The criteria for the diagnosis are: more than 5 degrees of wedging of at least three adjacent vertebrae at the apex of the kyphosis; a toracic kyphosis of more than 45 of Cobb's degree; Schmorl's nodes and endplates irregularities. In addition to classic SD, there are radiological alterations that remain asymptomatic for a long time to reveal in adult age: in that case it speaks of adult Scheuermann's disease (ASD). We considered the diagnosis of patients came from April 2006 to April 2007 on Day Hospital in our Clinic. ASD was diagnosed, besides, in 10 of these patients. 7 patients had previous diagnosis such as: dorsal Spondiloarthrosis (4 subjects); Osteoporosis with vertebral fractures (3 subjects). All these diagnosis was not confirmed by us. In case of chronic dorsalgia of adult, ASD is rarely considered as differential diagnosis. Besides, the vertebral dorsalgia, even in absence of red flags as fever, asthenia,hypersedimetry, functional loss and aching spinal processes to tapping, could hide a serious scene that lead us to be careful in the differential diagnosis, because of similar radiological pictures of the MSA to other pathology as spondylodiscitis, primitive or metastasic spinal tumors, and brittleness vertebral fractures."

CD008686,0,18414334,0,Diagnosis and management of malignant spinal cord compression: part 1.,"Malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC) is a particularly challenging area of cancer care where early diagnosis and expert multidisciplinary care and rehabilitation are paramount in optimising quality of life for the affected individual. The effects of MSCC can range from minor sensory, motor and autonomic changes to severe pain and complete paralysis that significantly affects the remainder of a patient's quality of life. When caught early, the symptoms of MSCC can be prevented, minimised or possibly reversed. However, failure to recognise the condition and its serious nature, together with limited awareness of the importance of early referral for treatment, can result in irreversible paralysis. Therefore, it is essential that nurses providing clinical care for these at-risk patients are able to identify early symptoms, and undertake a thorough patient history and examination, educating the patient and their family about the signs and symptoms, which should be reported as soon as they occur."

CD008686,0,18400050,0,"Improved outcome of EAN, an animal model of GBS, through amelioration of peripheral and central inflammation by minocycline.","Experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) is a widely used animal model of the human acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, which is the most common subtype of Guillain-Barré Syndrome. EAN is pathologically characterized by breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier, infiltration of reactive immune cells, local inflammation, demyelination in the peripheral nervous system and mechanical allodynia. Minocycline is known to have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, relieve of neuropathic pain following minocycline administration was observed in a variety of animal models. Here, we investigated the effects of minocycline on rat EAN. Suppressive treatment with minocycline (50 mg/kg body weight daily immediately after immunization) significantly attenuated the severity and duration of EAN. Macrophage and T-cell infiltration and demyelination in sciatic nerves of EAN rats treated with minocycline were significantly reduced compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated EAN rats. mRNA expressions of matrix metallopeptidase-9, inducible nitric oxide synthase and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in EAN sciatic nerves were greatly decreased by administration of minocycline as well. Furthermore, minocycline attenuated mechanical allodynia in EAN rats and greatly suppressed spinal microglial activation. All together, our data showed that minocycline could effectively suppress the peripheral and spinal inflammation (immune activation) to improve outcome in EAN rats, which suggests that minocycline may be considered as a potential candidate of pharmacological treatment for autoimmune-mediated neuropathies."
CD008686,0,18399615,0,Malignant bone tumors.,"Malignant bone tumors represent a small percentage of cancers nationwide and also are much less common than malignant soft-tissue tumors. The rarity of the condition makes it imperative that orthopaedic surgeons in nononcologic practices are able to recognize the symptoms that suggest a possible bony malignancy to avoid inappropriate or delayed treatment. The most common primary malignant bone tumors, osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma, occur in childhood. Chondrosarcoma occurs more frequently in older adults. Rare tumors such as chordoma and adamantinoma have anatomic predilections for the sacrum and tibia, respectively. The primary symptom of a patient with a malignant bone tumor is pain, which often occurs at rest or at night. There are also characteristic findings on physical examination such as swelling or decreased joint range of motion. Patients with a likely malignancy require thorough staging to determine the extent of disease and a well-planned biopsy for accurate diagnosis. The biopsy can be an image-guided needle biopsy or an open incisional biopsy. Knowledge of specific tumor characteristics and treatment options for osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, chordoma, and adamantinoma is important. Patients with osteosarcoma and resectable Ewing's sarcoma are treated with chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. Secondary sarcomas can occur in previously benign bone lesions and require aggressive treatment. Specific techniques are available for the resection of malignant bone tumors from the upper extremities, lower extremities, pelvis, and spine. Reconstruction options include the use of allografts, megaprostheses, and vascularized autografts. There has been a trend toward more prosthetic reconstructions because of early complications with allografts. The care of patients with primary malignant bone tumors requires a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. The orthopaedic oncologist is a vital member of a team composed of musculoskeletal radiologists and pathologists, radiation oncologists, medical and pediatric oncologists, and microvascular surgeons."

Wound exudate and serum mediators, pain scores, and analgesic consumption were measured at 1, 6, 24, and 48 hours after cesarean. In wound exudate, 19 of 20 mediators were reliably detected including interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1beta), nerve growth factor (NGF), prostaglandin E2 (PG-E2), and substance P. Wound PG-E2 and various cytokines peaked early, whereas NGF showed a more delayed release. There were no correlations between the concentration versus time profile of wound and serum cytokines. Analgesic consumption during the first 24 hours after surgery was negatively correlated with IL-1beta, IL-6, and G-CSF in the wound exudate. This study demonstrates the feasibility of collecting and measuring nociceptive and inflammatory mediators in surgical wounds at specific time points. The lack of significant correlations between wound and serum levels emphasizes the importance of determining site-specific release if localized pathologies are to be studied."
CD008686,0,18393166,0,Gangliocytic paraganglioma of the cauda equina with significant calcification: first description in pediatric age.,"A 17-year-old boy was referred with a 2-month history of low back pain and bilateral sciatica and difficulty in ambulation. Neurological examination found mild muscle weakness and diminished deep tendon reflexes in his right leg. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intradural-extramedullary tumor at the level of the L4, exiting through the right L4-L5 intervertebral foramen into the right psoas muscle. After total resection of the tumor, histopathological diagnosis revealed a gangliocytic paraganglioma. There are 184 paraganglioma cases reported at the lumbar region to date, and only 4 of them were in the pediatric age group. This report is the fifth paraganglioma case in the lumbar region and the first gangliocytic paraganglioma case in the pediatric age population."

CD008686,0,18389186,0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty and bone cement leakage: clinical experience with a new high-viscosity bone cement and delivery system for vertebral augmentation in benign and malignant compression fractures.,"The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of and venous leakage reduction in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) using a new high-viscosity bone cement (PMMA). PV has been used effectively for pain relief in osteoporotic and malignant vertebral fractures. Cement extrusion is a common problem and can lead to complications. Sixty patients (52 female; mean age, 72.2 +/- 7.2) suffering from osteoporosis (46), malignancy (12), and angiomas (2), divided into two groups (A and B), underwent PV on 190 vertebrae (86 dorsal, 104 lumbar). In Group A, PV with high-viscosity PMMA (Confidence, Disc-O-Tech, Israel) was used. This PMMA was injected by a proprietary delivery system, a hydraulic saline-filled screw injector. In Group B, a standard low-viscosity PMMA was used. Postprocedural CT was carried out to detect PMMA leakages and complications. Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank test were used to assess significant differences (p < 0.05) in leakages and to evaluate the clinical outcome. PV was feasible, achieving good clinical outcome (p < 0.0001) without major complications. In Group A, postprocedural CT showed an asymptomatic leak in the venous structures of 8 of 98 (8.2%) treated vertebrae; a discoidal leak occurred in 6 of 98 (6.1%). In Group B, a venous leak was seen in 38 of 92 (41.3%) and a discoidal leak in 12 of 92 (13.0%). Reduction of venous leak obtained by high-viscosity PMMA was highly significant (p < 0.0001), whereas this result was not significant (p = 0.14) related to the disc. The high-viscosity PMMA system is safe and effective for clinical use, allowing a significant reduction of extravasation rate and, thus, leakage-related complications."

CD008686,0,18379151,0,"Development of tumor-induced osteomalacia in a subcutaneous tumor, defined by venous blood sampling of fibroblast growth factor-23.","A 25-year-old man with severe lumbago was referred to our department for further evaluation. Serum phosphate and TmP/GFR levels were decreased. Physical examination revealed an elastic tumor in the instep of the right foot, which the patient reported having since the age of 10 years. He had no symptoms of osteomalacia at that time. Within the recent years, the tumor had grown in size and the patient developed lumbago. To examine the existence of a fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23)-producing tumor, venous blood was collected from four main veins. FGF-23 levels were significantly increased in the right femoral vein, compared with other veins. After the resection of the tumor, the histopathology was consistent with a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor (mixed connective tissue variant). Taken together, these results indicated that the development of osteomalacia in this patient was associated with the production of FGF-23 in the subcutaneous tumor."

CD008686,0,18362461,0,Spinal granulocytic sarcoma manifesting as radiculopathy in a nonleukemic patient.,"A 26-year-old nonleukemic woman presented with lumbosacral granulocytic sarcoma manifesting as progressive low back pain and numbness of her left lower leg persisting for 3 months. Physical examination revealed hypesthesia within the left S1 area of the sensory dermatome, decreased Achilles tendon reflex in the left lower extremity, and walking impairment due to severe pain in her left hip and leg. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an extradural mass in the spinal canal at the L5-S2 levels with invasion to the pelvis from the left sacral foramen. Positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) showed hyperaccumulation indicating malignant tumor. Baseline laboratory data were normal. Decompressive laminectomy and tumor removal were performed. Histological examination identified granulocytic sarcoma. Bone marrow involvement was absent. She underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, resulting in reduced residual lesion and neurological improvement. Immediate diagnosis and adequate systematic treatment are recommended for spinal granulocytic sarcoma in nonleukemic patients to prevent or delay progression to leukemia. The importance of immunohistochemical staining in the differential diagnosis from other types of spinal tumor, and the efficacy of FDG-PET for evaluation of the treatment are also emphasized."
CD008686,0,18361019,0,Anaesthetic management of a child with Freeman-sheldon syndrome undergoing spinal surgery.,"Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, or distal arthrogryposis type 2A, is a rare congenital myopathy and dysplasia characterised by multiple contractures, abnormalities of the head and face, defective development of the hands and feet and skeletal malformations. The facial muscle contracture produces the typical 'whistling face' appearance. Anaesthetic issues include difficult intravenous access, difficult airway and postoperative pulmonary complications. Although an association with malignant hyperthermia has been suggested, this has not been confirmed. We report the management of a seven-year-old girl with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome undergoing anterior and posterior spinal surgery and describe a successful anaesthetic regimen based on a total intravenous anaesthesia technique with remifentanil and propofol without neuromuscular blocking agents. The child had an uneventful anaesthetic and postoperative course. We believe the presence of the myopathy warranted the use of a 'non-triggering' anaesthetic, as suxamethonium and volatile agents may be associated with significant complications such as muscle rigidity and rhabdomyolysis in myopathic patients, even in the absence of malignant hyperthermia."
CD008686,0,18360122,0,Granular perineurioma: the first report of a rare distinctive subtype of perineurioma.,"Perineurioma represents a relatively recently described neoplasm in the spectrum of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors composed of perineurial cells staining immunohistochemically positive for epithelial membrane antigen. Although intraneural, extraneural and sclerosing perineurioma, rare variants of perineurioma, do occur, and knowledge of them is important in the differential diagnosis of mesenchymal tumors of different lines of differentiation and more importantly if their clinical course differs from that of other perineuriomas. We report herein the first case in the world literature of granular perineurioma arising in the dermal and subcutaneous tissues of the trunk of a 28-year-old female. The diagnosis was confirmed morphologically and immunohistochemically. More interestingly, 3 years later the patient complained of right lower extremity pain, for which magnetic resonance imaging studies showed an intraneural perineurioma confined to the sciatic nerve. The latter finding was confirmed both histopathologically and immunohistochemically to have exactly the same appearances of the original dermal and subcutaneous mass. Neoplastic cells stained positively for epithelial membrane antigen and for the newly described antibodies claudin-1 and glut-1. Interestingly, the granular component of this large tumor (4.5 cm in maximum diameter) was negative for S100, but positive for NKI-C3. The morphology, immunohistochemistry, and the clinical behavior for this tumor and the differential diagnoses are discussed."
CD008686,0,18351037,0,Parapharyngeal tumor mimicking cervicogenic headache.,"Nasopharyngeal cancer can occur in any age group and is often misdiagnosed. Cervicogenic headache (CEH) is a clinical condition, putatively originating from nociceptive structures in the neck. A patient with CEH-like symptoms occurring as a result of nasopharyngeal cancer invasion is reported. A 77-year-old man was admitted to the anesthesiology department (pain unit) with a 3-month history of severe unilateral headache. The headache began in the right part of the neck and spread to the right frontoorbital region and was always unilateral. There was no history of neck trauma, and the headache did not increase with neck movement. Analgesics were ineffective. The visual analog scale score for pain was 6. Neurological examination demonstrated tenderness over the right greater occipital nerve and reduced range of motion in the cervical spine. Cervical computerized tomography revealed a solid tumor in the right parapharyngeal region, adjacent to the C2-C3 vertebrae. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case in the literature of tumoral invasion of nasopharyngeal cancer presenting as CEH. Cervical neuroimaging is obligatory in patients with late-onset, severe CEH."
CD008686,0,18348718,0,Hereditary sensory neuropathy type I.,"Hereditary sensory neuropathy type I (HSN I) is a slowly progressive neurological disorder characterised by prominent predominantly distal sensory loss, autonomic disturbances, autosomal dominant inheritance, and juvenile or adulthood disease onset. The exact prevalence is unknown, but is estimated as very low. Disease onset varies between the 2nd and 5th decade of life. The main clinical feature of HSN I is the reduction of sensation sense mainly distributed to the distal parts of the upper and lower limbs. Variable distal muscle weakness and wasting, and chronic skin ulcers are characteristic. Autonomic features (usually sweating disturbances) are invariably observed. Serious and common complications are spontaneous fractures, osteomyelitis and necrosis, as well as neuropathic arthropathy which may even necessitate amputations. Some patients suffer from severe pain attacks. Hypacusis or deafness, or cough and gastrooesophageal reflux have been observed in rare cases. HSN I is a genetically heterogenous condition with three loci and mutations in two genes (SPTLC1 and RAB7) identified so far. Diagnosis is based on the clinical observation and is supported by a family history. Nerve conduction studies confirm a sensory and motor neuropathy predominantly affecting the lower limbs. Radiological studies, including magnetic resonance imaging, are useful when bone infections or necrosis are suspected. Definitive diagnosis is based on the detection of mutations by direct sequencing of the SPTLC1 and RAB7 genes. Correct clinical assessment and genetic confirmation of the diagnosis are important for appropriate genetic counselling and prognosis. Differential diagnosis includes the other hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN), especially HSAN II, as well as diabetic foot syndrome, alcoholic neuropathy, neuropathies caused by other neurotoxins/drugs, immune mediated neuropathy, amyloidosis, spinal cord diseases, tabes dorsalis, lepra neuropathy, or decaying skin tumours like amelanotic melanoma. Management of HSN I follows the guidelines given for diabetic foot care (removal of pressure to the ulcer and eradication of infection, followed by the use of specific protective footwear) and starts with early and accurate counselling of patients about risk factors for developing foot ulcerations. The disorder is slowly progressive and does not influence life expectancy but is often severely disabling after a long duration of the disease."
CD008686,0,18338266,0,The effects of hyperprolactinemia on bone and fat.,"Many patients with prolactin secreting pituitary tumors have decreased bone mineral. The bone loss is associated with an increase in bone resorption and is secondary to prolactin-induced hypogonadism. In both sexes trabecular bone in the spine and hip is more affected than cortical bone in the distal radius. Normalization of prolactin and restoration of gonadal function increases bone density but is not associated with normalization of bone mass. It is not known whether the bone loss in hyperprolactinemic subjects represents a failure to achieve peak bone mass or is due to accelerated bone loss. Despite low bone density hyperprolactinemic subjects do not demonstrate increased fractures. The association between prolactin, weight gain and obesity suggests that prolactin may also be a modulator of body composition and body weight. It is not known whether hyperprolactinemia associated weight gain is due to stimulation of lipogenesis or due to disruption of central nervous system dopaminergic tone. Hyperprolactinemia is also associated with insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction which may improve after normalization of prolactin. The clinical significance of these findings and the precise role of prolactin in regulation of weight and metabolism remain to be elucidated."

CD008686,0,18328982,0,Sclerosing bone disorders.,"Sclerosing bone disorders are a diagnostic challenge. However, hereditary sclerosing disorders often have characteristic radiological features that allow their diagnosis. Osteocondensation can result from decreased bone resorption; malignant recessive osteopetroses have been related to mutations in several genes necessary for osteoclast function and also, more recently, to osteoclast differentiation (RANK-L). Albers-Schonberg disease or autosomal-dominant osteopetrosis type II has the characteristic 'sandwich vertebrae' and 'bone within bone' radiological features. It has been related to mutation in chloride channel 7, which is necessary for osteoclast acidification. Osteocondensation can also be related to increased bone formation. Camurati-Engelman dysplasia is a disabilitating disorder with leg pain and weakness, and thickening of the diaphysis of long bones on x ray. It is due to activating mutations in the gene encoding TGF-beta, a growth factor that increases bone formation. Other less common recessive or dominant sclerosing disorders, such as endosteal hyperostosis, sclerostosis, van Buchen disease and high bone mass syndrome, are due to mutations in two genes (LRP5 and SOST) of the Wnt pathway that induce increased osteoblast activity. Recent elucidation of the molecular mechanism responsible for several hereditary diseases with osteocondensation has improved our comprehension of bone remodelling. It has allowed the discovery of new targets for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, some of which are already being investigated in clinical trials. Molecular mechanism for some hereditary osteocondensation remains to be discovered."

Involvement of the sciatic nerve mimics chronic sciatic pain due to a herniated disk. If there is no lumbar pain and lumbar MRI is normal, the sciatic nerve must be clinically and radiologically examined all along its course. We report a patient with chronic sciatica in whom physical examination revealed a painful mass with a Tinel sign in her back thigh. MRI showed a multilobular mass along the sciatic nerve. Surgery of this plexiform schwannoma allowed a complete relief from pain."
CD008686,0,18318883,0,Neuropathic and psychogenic itch.,"Neuropathic and psychogenic itch are two entities that have not been well studied. Neuropathic itch is related to pathology located at any point along the afferent pathway of the nervous system. It could be related to damage to the peripheral nervous system, such as in postherpetic neuropathy, brachioradial pruritus, notalgia paresthetica, and in central nervous system damage as a result of spinal cord tumors and demyelinization diseases such as multiple sclerosis. It has many clinical features similar to neuropathic pain. Patients complain of itch, which coincides with burning sensation, aching, and stinging. Psychogenic itch is related to psychologic abnormalities e.g., itch in obsessive compulsive disorders, depression, and delusions of parasitosis. Although no controlled studies have been conducted for treatment of neuropathic and psychogenic itch, medications that are part of the treatment armentarium for neuropathic pain, depression, and anxiety seem to be effective."

CD008686,0,18310848,0,Chondromyxoid fibroma of the seventh cervical vertebra.,"Chondromyxoid fibroma is a rare benign bone tumor representing less than 0.5% of all bone tumors. It commonly involves the long tubular bones. Involvement of the spine is rare. A 35-year-old man presented with history of neck pain, restriction of neck movements, pain and numbness along the medial aspect of the left forearm and weakness with wasting of the left hand. A presumptive diagnosis of a bony tumor such as an aneurysmal bone cyst or a giant cell tumor involving the seventh vertebral body was made on plain X-rays, MRI and bone scan. He underwent C7 central corpectomy, incomplete intralesional curettage with iliac bone grafting and C6 to T1 interspinous wiring. The histological diagnosis was chondromyxoid fibroma. On eight years' follow-up, CT scan showed no progression of the tumor with good alignment and fusion of the graft at the site of the corpectomy. The authors conclude that corpectomy and iliac bone grafting for chondromyxoid fibroma has a good outcome on long-term follow-up."
CD008686,0,18310274,0,Bone metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinoma.,"The presence of distant metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinoma decreases the 10-year survival of patients by 50%. Bone metastases represent a frequent complication especially of follicular thyroid cancer and severely reduce the quality of life causing pain, fractures, and spinal cord compression. Diagnosis is established by correlating clinical suspicion with imaging. Imaging is essential to detect, localize, and assess the extension of the lesions and should be used in conjunction with clinical evidence. Bone metastases are typically associated with elevated markers of bone turnover, but these markers have not been evaluated in differentiated thyroid cancer. Skeletal and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging and fusion 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) are the best anatomic and functional imaging techniques available in specialized centers. For well-differentiated lesions, iodine-PET scan combined (124)I-PET/CT is the newest imaging development and (131)I is the first line of treatment. Bisphosphonates reduce the complications rate and pain, alone or in combination with radioiodine, radionuclides, or external beam radiotherapy and should be employed. Surgery and novel minimally invasive consolidation techniques demand an appropriate patient selection for best results on a multimodal approach. Basic research on interactions between tumor cells and bone microenvironment are identifying potential novel targets for future more effective therapeutic interventions for less differentiated tumors."

T2-weighted magnetic resonanse imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord showed hyperintense lesions in the thoracic and sacral cord. Multiple sclerosis was assumed, and steroid pulse therapy was therefore administered: this temporarily improved the symptoms and imaging findings. However, the symptoms recurred in 2 months. The patient died after ineffective steroid therapy. Large B-cell lymphoma cells were identified on bone marrow biopsy. Macroscopic neuropathology revealed neoplastic cells in the blood vessels of the cauda equina.

CD008686,0,18303662,0,[Acute low back pain--assessment and management].,"Acute low back pain is a very common symptom. Up to 90% of all adults suffer at least once in their life from a low back pain episode, in the majority of cases a nonspecific lumbago. They are, with or without sciatica, usually self-limited and have no serious underlying pathology and subside in 80-90% of the concerned patients within six weeks. Beside a sufficient pain medication and physiotherapy, reassurance about the overall benign character and the favourable prognosis of the medical condition should be in the centre of the therapeutic efforts. A more thorough assessment is required for selected patients with warning signs, so called ""red flags"" findings, because they are associated with an increased risk of cauda equina syndrome, cancer, infection, or fracture. These patients also require a closer follow-up and, in some cases, an urgent surgical intervention. Among patients with acute nonspecific mechanical low back pain, imaging diagnostic can be delayed for at least four to six weeks, which usually allows the medical condition to improve. From a therapeutic viewpoint, there is enough evidence for the effectiveness of paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, heat therapy, physiotherapy, and the advice to stay ""active"". A complete relief and protection represent an out-dated concept, because the deconditioning is stimulated and the return to the workplace is needlessly delayed. Spinal manipulative therapy may provide short-term benefits in certain patients. In a multimodal therapeutic concept, the patient education should focus on the natural history of an acute back pain episode, the overall good prognosis, and recommendations for an effective treatment."

Next cauda equina compression is differentiated from clinical entities that can be treated on an elective basis. Low back strain, herniated nucleus pulposis, spinal stenosis, and degenerative disease are each discussed with an emphasis on imaging studies finding a correlation between history, physical, and the neurodiagnostic testing.

Magnetic resonance imaging of neck demonstrated wide spread enhancing mass of the deep neck space, leading to the final diagnosis of deep neck abscess.

However, the clinico-pathological spectrum might be very heterogenous. Herein, we report 4 cases exhibiting lumbar tumor masses, 1 causing muscular atrophy over a 30-year period, 3 displaying clinical history of persisting lumbar pain for only several weeks. All tumors were crooked with dura and spinal roots resulting in incomplete resection in three cases. On histological examination, two tumors were almost acellular and showed polycyclic hyaline and fibrotic extracellular matrix leading to differential diagnoses of chordoma, meningioma, fibrolipoma and ependymoma. Finally, together with the immunohistochemical investigations, electron microscopy led to the diagnosis of myxopapillary ependymoma, WHO Grade I, with massive degenerative changes. The other 2 cases presented with the typical neuropathology of myxopapillary ependymomas but showed local recurrence within 1 and 13 years throughout the whole neuraxis, and in 1 case additional metastases of the 3rd ventricle. Although the morphological feature of these myxopapillary ependymomas was benign, the presented cases showed that the biological behavior of myxopapillary tumors might differ greatly and that these tumors present a serious operative and diagnostic challenge. Myxopapillary ependymomas occur most often in the lumbosacral region. Due to the anatomic complexity of the cauda equina, a complete resection can be technically challenging in this region. However, a gross total resection at the primary surgery is the most predictive factor for the outcome."
CD008686,0,18249122,0,Lumbar spinal epidural angiolipoma.,"Spinal angiolipomas are rare benign tumours most commonly found in the thoracic spine. A case of an extradural lumbar angiolipoma in a 47-year-old female is described. She had a recent history of lower back pain accompanied by sciatica. Lumbar MRI revealed a dorsal epidural mass at the L2-L3 level. The patient underwent a bilateral laminectomy, in which the tumour was totally excised. The pathological examination indicated haemangiolipoma. Post-operatively, the patient's neurological signs and symptoms improved remarkably quickly. MRI at 6 and 18 months after surgery revealed no evidence of tumour recurrence."
CD008686,0,18248288,0,Cystic lesion of the ventriculus terminalis: proposal for a new clinical classification.,"The ventriculus terminalis is a small cavity inside the conus medullaris that is formed during the embryonic development. Previous reports regarding cystic lesion of the ventriculus terminalis (CLVT) in adults have detailed a broad and diversified distribution in terms of clinical symptoms, clinical evolution, neurological findings, and treatment. Therefore, nonstandardized management has led to unsatisfactory outcomes. Thus, the authors propose a new classification system in which the clinical presentation is taken into account to standardize the cases and facilitate the proper management of these lesions. Two more cases are described. The literature was reviewed, dividing the patients into 3 groups by clinical presentation as follows: CLVT Type I, patients with nonspecific neurological symptoms or nonspecific complaints; CLVT Type II, presence of focal neurological deficit; and CLVT Type III, presence of sphincter disturbances (bowel or bladder dysfunction). Two patients were classified as CLVT Type I, 3 as CLVT Type II, and 12 as CLVT Type III. In Type I, no improvement was observed in clinical evaluation after surgery, and stable symptoms were achieved with clinical management. In Type II, 2 patients had total improvement and 1 had subtotal improvement after surgery. Finally, in Type III, 92% of the patients improved postoperatively; among these 33% presented with total improvement. Only 1 case in this group was handled conservatively and no improvement was documented. This new classification is useful to group the patients into 3 clinical types to provide guidance as to the best management options. Treatment for the Type I lesion seems to be best conducted conservatively, whereas Types II and III seem to be best handled surgically."

CD008686,0,18242856,0,Peripheral cannabinoids attenuate carcinoma-induced nociception in mice.,"We investigated the cannabinoid receptor (CBr) agonists Win55,212-2 (non-selective) and AM1241 (CBr2 selective) and the peripheral receptor (CBr1) in carcinoma-induced pain using a mouse model. Tumors were induced in the hind paw of female mice by local injection of a human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Significant pain, as indicated by reduction in withdrawal thresholds in response to mechanical stimulation, began at 4 days after SCC inoculation and lasted to 18 days. Local administration of Win55,212-2 (10 mg/kg) and AM1241 (10 mg/kg) significantly elevated withdrawal thresholds, indicating an antinociceptive effect. Ipsilateral expression of CBr1 protein in L5 DRG was significantly upregulated compared to ipsilateral L4 DRG and in normal tissue. These findings support the suggestion that cannabinoids are capable of producing antinociception in carcinoma-induced pain."
CD008686,0,18242822,0,Calcifying pseudoneoplasm of the spine.,"Calcifying pseudoneoplasms have been rarely reported to involve the spine. Diagnostically, MRI characteristics have not been well-described. We present the case of a 59-year-old woman with a C8 radiculopathy and history significant for metastatic breast cancer. MRI showed a C7-T1 extradural mass with an isointense signal to the spinal cord on T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Mild peripheral enhancement was also noted. The patient underwent a laminectomy to accomplish resection of the underlying lesion. The mass was firm, tan-colored, and adherent to the adjacent dura. A gross total resection was achieved and, postoperatively, the patient had resolution of her radiculopathy. Pathologic analysis confirmed a calcifying pseudoneoplasm. Calcifying pseudoneoplasms can cause exclusively axial pain or may induce radicular or myelopathic symptoms. The pathogenesis is unclear, although the lesions are usually benign. MRI findings can vary, but typically the lesions are extradural, well-demarcated, and mildly enhance peripherally. Surgical resection, either subtotal or total, is highly successful."

The tumor was incidentally diagnosed during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine to investigate back pain. The MRI was followed by fine needle aspiration cytology that confirmed the diagnosis. The patient, however, did report a history of intermittent episodes of headaches, increased sweating, palpitations, and elevations in blood pressure. The tumor was excised laparoscopically without complications. Needle biopsy of a retroperitoneal mass that could be a paraganglioma must be avoided."
CD008686,0,18232277,0,"[Obesity, personal and social problem].","Obesity is risk-factor for the most common nowdays diseases, as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, some carcinomas, degenerative diseases of weight bearing joints (spine, hips, knees), and present a huge medical and social problem, as well. It causes not only somatic but mental problems as well, especially in females and younger persons. Some of them undergo risky weight reducing methods, surgical procedures, etc, to reduce their body weight and to release mentally stressing body deformities. Aim of the work is to quantify negative impaction of obesity on functionality of the knee, the key joint in everyday body activities (rising, standing, walking, and climbing). Study has analyzed 22 randomly chosen patients (5 male, 17 female) with strong degenerative alteration of the knee (osteoarthritis), who were treated on the Department for orthopedic and traumatology, Clinical center Sarajevo during 2005 and 2006. Average age was 63.6 +/- 10.6 (54-76) years, with Body Mass Index (level of obesity) 31.1 +/- 3.5 (27-38) points, and average duration of symptoms 9.1 +/- 7.4 (1-25) years. The knee functionality was assessed by Knee Society Knee Score (KSKS). Completely healthy knee has 200 points--50 points for pain free knee, 25 points for stabile knee, and forfull extension-flexion arch, both, 50 points for normal walking and stairs climbing, both. Average value of KSKS was 118.1 +/- 35.0 points. As it was expected, there were strong significant correlation between KSKS and age (r = -0.50, p = 0.015). The duration of disability correlated with KSKS (r = -0.5, p = 0.02), and level of pain (r = 0.60, p=0.00). The obesity has significantly increased level of pain in the knee (r = -0.44, p = 0.04), all patients were obese persons. Persons with reduced functional abilities avoid body activity, it causes increasing of obesity, and one makes other worse. Concerning on incidence of described problem and its impaction on society in general, it is necessary to make every effort in prevention and treatment of obesity, as important risk factor and consequence of reduced functional abilities and risk factor of most common nowadays diseases."
CD008686,0,18215498,0,Pain control by image-guided radiosurgery for solitary spinal metastasis.,"Precision and accuracy of image-guided spinal radiosurgery has been previously demonstrated. This study was carried out to determine the clinical efficacy of spine radiosurgery for the treatment of solitary spinal metastases with or without cord compression. A total of 49 patients with 61 separate spinal metastases were treated with radiosurgery. All patients had pathologically proven primary cancers and had either synchronous or metachronous metastasis to the spine. The majority of the patients presented with back pain. All patients received single-dose radiosurgery to the involved spine only. The radiosurgery dose ranged from 10 to 16Gy. The primary endpoint was pain control, but outcomes in neurological status and radiological tumor control also were assessed. The median time to pain relief was 14 days and the earliest time of pain relief was within 24hours. Complete pain relief was achieved in 46%, partial relief in 18.9%, and stable symptoms in 16.2%. Relapse of pain at the treated spinal segment was 6.9%. Median duration of pain relief at the treated spine was 13.3 months. Overall pain control rate for one year was 84%. This experience demonstrates that spinal radiosurgery can achieve rapid and durable pain relief. Single-dose radiosurgery has a potential to be a viable treatment option for single spinal metastasis."
CD008686,0,18208886,0,Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome.,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by severe episodes of optic nerve and spinal cord inflammation. NMO-IgG (anti-aquaporin-4) has been recently described as a sensitive and specific marker for NMO. As there have been prior published reports of an association between NMO and systemic autoimmune diseases, the prognostic value of the antibody test in these cases is uncertain. We describe a 47-year old woman with recurrent transverse myelitis and a long-standing history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS). While she did not have a history of optic neuritis, serological testing for the NMO-IgG was positive when she was admitted for her second episode of transverse myelitis. Testing for the NMO-IgG in cases of isolated or recurrent transverse myelitis attributed to current SLE and APLS may help clarify the diagnosis of a distinct disease process likely to cause recurrent and severe disability, warranting more aggressive immunotherapy."

CD008686,0,18204960,0,[Use of imaging procedures in the diagnostics of osteoporosis interpretation of x-rays and bone density measurements].,"According to the recently published BoneEVA study, 7.8 million Germans (6.5 million women) are affected by osteoporosis. Of them, 4.3% experienced at least one clinical fracture. Only 21.7% were treated with an anti-osteoporotic drug, whereby only 10% received a bisphosphonate and 17% given calcium and vitamin D. On the other hand, as osteoporosis may be associated with severe pain in 90% of patients, analgesics are prescribed. The total direct costs attributable to osteoporosis amounted to Euro 5.4 billion in 2003. One out of three postmenopausal women and one out of five men over the age of 50 years will experience osteoporotic fractures unless preventive measures are undertaken. According to the German guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis, bone densitometry using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) together with other clinical risk factors (previous low trauma fracture, use of nicotine, low body weight [BMI<20 kg/m2], immobilisation, and more than two falls during the last six months) are recommended for diagnosis. Using typical cases out of clinical practice, this article delineates frequent mistakes in the interpretation of DXA measurements. Furthermore, the present paper clarifies the role of classical x-rays, which still represent the predominant procedure for the identification of fractures and especially vertebral fractures. In comparison to x-rays, CT or MRI are more important in differential diagnosis of malignant disease and bone metastases. Essentially a reduction of vertebral height without evidence of central endplate fracture in postmenopausal women may be unrelated to osteoporosis. Quantitative morphometry should not be used alone for the assessment of vertebral fracture in clinical decision-making. Therefore, we recommend differential diagnosis of morphometric vertebral deformities by an expert reader to rule out deformities related to degenerative disease and norm variants of which we will present several examples to train the view of the reader."

We document a case in a 58-year-old man who presented with about 2 months history of motor weakness and speech dysfunction. The tumor was a heterogeneously enhanced dural-based tumor with high vascularity and perifocal edema in the left frontal lobe. The tumor was completely removed followed by embolization and preoperative radiotherapy. Histologic examination revealed a hemangioblastoma with features resembling angiomatous meningioma. Immunohistochemistry for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and S100 may be helpful to make differential diagnosis.

In the higher age groups, the incidence increases. Multiple myeloma is an illness that reacts well to treatment which can result in periods of remission lasting for years. Some of the patients are even able to return to work. A pre-requisite for successful treatment is early diagnosis and this is usually in the hands of first line physicians. This is the reason why the Czech Myeloma Group, in conjunction with neurologists, orthopedicians and radio diagnosticians has issued the following recommendations for first line physicians containing a more detailed description of the symptoms and the diagnostic pitfalls of the disease. This disease reminds a chameleon for the variety of its symptoms. For the sake of clarification, we shall divide multiple myeloma symptoms into five points, each of which is reason enough to warrant an examination to confirm or rule out a malignant cause of health problems (a negative result does not automatically mean exclusion). If any of the recommended examinations results positive, the diagnostic process must be continued, in which case a general practitioner refers the patient to a specialist health centre. Observing these recommendations should minimize the number of cases of late diagnosis. 1. Bone destruction symptoms. - Unexplained backache for more than one month in any part of spine even without nerve root irritability or without pain in other part of skeleton (ribs, hips, or long bones). - Pain at the beginning of myeloma disease is very similar to benigne common discopathy, however the intensity of backache is decreasing within one months in benigne disease. In the case of malignant process the intensity of bone pain is steadily increasing. - Immediate imaging and laboratory investigation are indicated by resting and night pain in spinal column or in any part of skeleton. - Backache with the sign of spinal cord or nerve compression should be sent for immediate X Ray, and focussed CT/MRI followed by acute surgery if needed. - Osteoporosis especially in men and premenopausal women. 2. Features of changed immunity or bone marrow function. Persistent and recurrent infection, typical is normochromic anaemia, with leucopenia and trombocytopenia. 3. Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate even increase concentration of total plasma protein. 4. Impaired renal function. Increased level of creatinin or proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome with bilateral legs oedema. 5. Hypercalcemia with typical clinical symptoms (polyuria with dehydratation, constipation, nausea, low level conscience, coma). Every one from these points has to be reason for general medical doctor to start battery of tests: -X-ray of bones focused to painful area (mandatory before physiotherapy, local anaesthesia or other empiric therapy). If plain X-ray does not elucidate pain and symptoms are lasting more than one month, please consider all circumstances and results from laboratory investigation. This patient needs referral to the centre with MRI/CT facilities (CT or MRI is necessary investigation in case of nerve root or spine compression). -Investigation of erythrocyte sedimantion rate (high level of sedimentation of erythrocyte can indicate multiple myeloma). -Full blood count. -Basic biochemical investigation serum and urine: serum urea, creatinin, ionts including calcium, total protein, and albumin CRP (high concentration of total protein indicates myeloma, low level of albumin indicates general pathological process, similary increased concentration of fibrinogen, impaired renal function indicates myeloma kidney, however hypercalcemia is typical for highly aggressive myeloma). -Quantitative screening for IgG, IgM and IgA in serum (isolated raised level one of immunoglobulin with decreased level of the others indicates myeloma). -Common electrophoresis of serum is able to detect monoclonal immunoglobulin level at few gramm concentration. If all the laboratory investigation are in normal level the possibility that the current problems are multiple myeloma origine is smaller, but it does not exclude one of rare variant--non secretory myeloma (undifferentiated plasmocyt lost characteristic feature to produce monoclonal immunoglobulin). If any of tests indicate the possibility of myeloma, patient require urgent specialist referral to department with possibility to make diagnosis of malignant myeloma."

We report on the case of a patient with primary leiomyosarcoma of the thyroid gland and review the literature. An 83-year-old woman complaining of neuropathic pain in her left arm and enlargement of her anterior neck underwent multiple surgical biopsies of the thyroid gland. The tumor was composed of interlacing fascicles of spindle-shaped cells that expressed smooth muscle actin and vimentin but were negative for cytokeratins and thyroglobulin. Ultrastructurally, bundles of myofilaments were present. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a thyroid tumor that directly extended to the adjacent vertebra with an associated pachymeningitis. The patient died 2 months after surgery. The diagnosis of primary leiomyosarcoma of the thyroid gland is difficult and requires numerous clinical, radiologic, and pathologic data.

CD008686,0,19505000,0,[Lumbago and sciatica].,"Low back pain, together woth shoulder and neck pain, affect millions of individuals, and is a very usual topic of concern. Frequently is associated with sciatica. Two different low back pain groups are reported: 1--Unspecific low back pain; 2--Organic low bck pain. Unspecific low back pain: two considerations must be present: a) Absence of clinical or radiological signs of concrete disease, and b) Presence of a psychological profile defined by a personality unable to live together with pain. Different pathogenic mechanisms have been invoked to explain the unspecific low back pain: disc herniation irritating the posterior disc ring and the common posterior vertebral ligament, arthritis of small and real--have synovial--, interapophyseal joints, trigger zones of local spasm in the spinal muscles, postural changes after having remained a long time in the same position, and for some few ones, ligament instability in the sacroiliac joint. Organic low back pain: characterized like congenital diseases, acquired diseases--discal herniation, spondylosis, lumbar spine stenosis--, And systemic diseases affecting the spine: aortoiliac chronic vascular disease and abdominal processes causing lumbar and buttocks pain. The therapeutic alternative is either conservative or surgical. Surgery is protagonist in post-traumatic unstale spine, in unstable spondylolisthesis, in spine persistent infections and in spine tumours. Also is subsidiary of surgical treatment the disc degeneration with nerve root irritation causing motor disturbance. The disc degeneration without root irritation precludes conservative management: percutaneous manual nucleotomy, coblation nucleoplasty or back schools programmes, defined like interventions consisting of education and skill programmes supervised by a physical therapist trained in back rehabilitation."
CD008686,0,19364066,0,Administration of autologous bone marrow stem cells into spinal cord injury patients via multiple routes is safe and improves their quality of life: comprehensive case studies.,"Presently, there is no cure or effective treatment for spinal cord injury (SCI). Studies in SCI patients have shown that for a treatment to be effective it must primarily improve their quality of life. Numerous studies have shown that stem cells represent an alternative treatment for various disorders and have shown promise in several disease/trauma states. For instance, the use of autologous CD34+ stem cells has been shown to ameliorate symptoms of several disorders such as leukemia, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis. For the first time, we report eight case studies of SCI (four acute, four chronic) with approximately 2 years of follow-up that were administered bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) via multiple routes: directly into the spinal cord, directly into the spinal canal, and intravenous. Magnetic resonance imaging illustrated morphological changes in the spinal cord of some of the patients following BMSCs administration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate improvements in ASIA, Barthel (quality of life), Frankel, and Ashworth scoring. Moreover, in order to assess bladder function, we designed a simple numerical clinical scoring system that demonstrates significant changes in bladder function following BMSCs administration. To date, we have administration BMSCs into 52 patients with SCI and have had no tumor formations, no cases of infection or increased pain, and few instances of minor adverse events. These studies demonstrate that BMSCs administration via multiple routes is feasible, safe, and may improve the quality of life for patients living with SCI."

CD008686,0,18157607,0,Chylous cyst formation following laparoscopic fundoplication.,"Formation of an abdominal chylous cyst is a rare event, predominantly occurring after spinal, vascular or urologic retroperitoneal surgery. As far as we know, the presented case is the first report in the literature of chylous cyst formation after laparoscopic fundoplication. A 57-year-old man with a history of a conservatively treated spinal compression fracture (T11/12) underwent laparoscopic fundoplication in 1996 for recurrent heartburn with insufficient response to treatment with PPI. His reflux symptoms disappeared but over the following years he developed intermittent abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. Gastroscopy in 2002 revealed a slight compression of the distal esophagus. CT scan revealed a cystic formation next to the distal esophagus which was initially interpreted to be part of the fundoplicate itself. Aggravation of symptoms and weight loss was noted in 2006. A further CT scan revealed a 7 cm cyst along the fundoplicate and the lesser curvature of the stomach. The cyst was subsequently drained laparoscopically. Cholesterol (351 mg/d), LDL-cholesterol (263 mg/dl), triglycerides (334 mg/dl) and chylomicrons led to the diagnosis chylous cyst and the patient was put on a medium-chain triglyceride diet. After 12 weeks the discharge stopped and the drain was removed. The patient remained symptom-free for seven months but then presented again with the same complaints. This time an even larger cyst was diagnosed, extending from the lesser curvature of the stomach through the esophageal hiatus up to the right atrium. A Roux-en-Y chylous cystojejunostomy was then performed and has solved the problem up to the present. A chylous cyst may develop after laparoscopic fundoplication. If simple drainage fails, a cystojejunostomy can solve this problem."

CD008686,0,18092709,0,Evaluation of back pain in children and adolescents.,"Back pain is fairly prevalent in healthy children and adolescents. When children or adolescents seek medical care for back pain, it is highly likely that underlying pathology will be identified. Common causes of back pain include nonspecific pain or muscle strain, herniated disk, spondylolysis, scoliosis, and Scheuermann's kyphosis. Less common causes include tumor, infection, and sickle cell crisis. If nonspecific back pain is suspected, treatment may include home-based exercise, physical therapy, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If the history and physical examination suggest underlying pathology, radiography, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a C-reactive protein measurement should be performed. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or bone scanning may be needed depending on the suspected cause. It is generally accepted that the following factors warrant immediate evaluation: patient age younger than four years, persistent symptoms, self-imposed activity limitations, systemic symptoms, increasing discomfort, persistent night-time pain, and neurologic symptoms."

Initial intrathecal morphine dose was calculated from the previous opioid consumption using a morphine oral-intrathecal ratio of 100:1. Then, doses of both drugs were modified during the treatment according to the clinical needs and balanced with adverse effects. Fifty-five patients were assessed during admission, before starting the intrathecal treatment, during the titration phase, and followed up to death, by frequent phone contacts or visits, as available. Pain and symptom intensities were recorded before starting the intrathecal treatment (T0), at time of hospital discharge (T dis), and then at 1 month (T1), 3 months (T3), 6 months (T6) intervals, and the last observation, at least 1 week before death (T death). Fifty-five patients were selected for starting an intrathecal treatment. Thirty-two patients were males. The mean age was 60 years (95% CI 57-63), and 65.4% of patients were under 65 years. The most frequent indication was the presence of adverse effects and poor pain control. Complete data with adequate follow-up until death were available in 45 patients. Statistical differences in pain intensity were found at the different time intervals examined until death. Statistical decreases in the intensity of drowsiness and confusion were found until 1 month after starting intrathecal therapy. Statistical differences were found in daily intrathecal morphine doses, with a 3-fold increase at time of hospital discharge. Subsequently, further increases in doses were not significant. Conversely, systemic opioids, expressed as oral morphine equivalents, significantly decreased at all the intervals examined until death. Early complications included mild bleeding in 2 patients, without consequences, headache in 4 patients, bladder catheterization in 6 patients, reoperation for bleeding or changes of catheter position in 4 patients, unrelated death in 1 patient, and stroke in another 1. Late complications included local infection in 2 patients, and discontinuation of intrathecal therapy due to spinal compression. In patients who had received multiple trial of opioids and routes of administration, the intrathecal treatment started with an oral-intrathecal morphine conversion ratio of 100:1, and local anesthetics at the most convenient clinical doses provided a long-term improvement of analgesia, with a decrease in adverse effects and opioid consumption until death."
CD008686,0,18074136,0,Epidural hematoma mimicking transverse myelitis in a patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome.,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease, and its most critical pathologic process is thrombosis, which may explain most of the clinical features. Acute management of thrombosis involves immediate anticoagulation. Acute proximal venous thrombosis can be managed with thrombolytic therapy to reduce the long-term complications of the postthrombotic syndrome (pain, swelling, skin discoloration, or ulceration) and perform recanalization of occluded vessels. However, thrombolytic therapies are associated with high risks of bleeding. To our knowledge, this is the first report of epidural hematoma mimicking transverse myelitis after catheter-directed thrombolysis in a patient with primary APS. A 42-year-old male was admitted with sudden onset pain and swelling on left lower extremity. Venography demonstrated multiple thrombi on superficial femoral vein, common femoral vein, common iliac vein, and external iliac vein. Laboratory tests indicated the presence of IgM anticardiolipin antibody. He was diagnosed with primary APS with multiple venous thrombi. He was treated with urokinase (200,000/h) as thrombolytic therapy. After 1 day, he complained both leg weakness and urinary dysfunction. T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of spine showed about 8 cm-sized mass, suggesting hematoma on the posterior epidural space at thoracolumbar area. Despite the successful evacuation of hematoma, neurologic symptoms persisted and he is now receiving aspirin, warfarin, and physical therapy."
CD008686,0,18071987,0,The surgical management of metastatic spinal disease: prospective assessment and long-term follow-up.,"The last decade has witnessed a resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of metastatic spinal disease to compliment radiotherapy. A recent randomized controlled trial looking directly at this issue concluded strongly in favour of a combination of surgical decompression and radiotherapy, and there is now growing enthusiasm for surgery to play a role in the management of these patients. We present a prospective cohort study of 62 patients who presented with metastatic cord or cauda equina compression, and were treated with surgical decompression and fixation where necessary. Patients were treated by one surgeon working in a single unit. They were followed-up long term and were assessed objectively, by clinical assessment and prospective questionnaires that included SF36, visual analogue pain scores and Roland Morris back pain scores. Sixty-two patients with a median age of 62 (22-79 years, 27 male) were included in the study. The commonest primary tumours were breast (26%) and lymphoma (13%). The majority of patients had involvement of thoracic vertebrae (58%). 56% of patients were alive at 1 year and 28% at 3 years, with significant improvements observed in both walking and continence. Similarly, significant improvements were seen in SF36 quality of life scores as well as pain. With careful patient selection, long-term survival and good quality of life can be achieved. However, not every patient is suitable or appropriate for surgery, and the discussion focuses on where the surgical threshold should be set."
CD008686,0,18070825,0,Thoracic paravertebral block for analgesia following liver mass radiofrequency ablation.,"A 66-year-old man presented for a second attempt of radiofrequency ablation of a metastatic carcinoid liver lesion. The first attempt using intravenous sedation was unsuccessful because of inadequate pain control and subsequent patient combativeness. Despite fentanyl being given during general anaesthesia, the patient complained of severe right flank pain after emergence. A thoracic paravertebral block was performed without complication and the patient's pain decreased to ""3 out of 10"" on a standard 10-point scale after 10 min, and ""0 out of 10"" after 30 min. The patient's pain score remained 0 throughout the following day, and no further analgesics were required. Thoracic paravertebral block can provide complete and lasting analgesia following hepatic radiofrequency ablation, and warrants further study for patients undergoing hepatic radiological interventions."
CD008686,0,18068658,0,Jaw avascular osteonecrosis after treatment of multiple myeloma with zoledronate.,"Multiple myeloma, the second most common haematopoietic cancer, which represents the collection of plasma-cell neoplasms that invariably becomes fatal when self-renewing myeloma cells begin unrestrained proliferation. The major clinical manifestation of multiple myeloma is related to the loss of bone through osteolysis. This can lead to pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, hypercalcaemia, and pain. It is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients, who frequently require radiation therapy, surgery and analgesic medications. Bisphosphonates are specific inhibitors of osteoclastic activity, and are currently used to prevent bone complications and to treat malignant hypercalcaemia in patients with multiple myeloma, or bone metastases from breast and prostate cancers. Hence, osteonecrosis of the mandible has been reported in three patients from Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia (CHVNG) with multiple myeloma treated for over 18-48 months with intravenous zoledronate, commonly prescribed for multiple myeloma therapy. Although, this report alerts clinicians about the potential complication of bone necrosis in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, many questions remain concerning the underlying pathogenesis of this process."

Only little is known about CSF findings in this new disorder. Here we report the results of 29 lumbar punctures in 17 patients with VGKC-LE. Slight pleocytosis, mainly consisting of lymphocytes and monocytes, and elevated total protein concentrations were present in 41 and 47%, respectively. Intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis as defined by the presence of CSF-specific oligoclonal IgG bands, an increased IgG index, or an elevated IgG, IgA, or IgM ratio, was not detected in any of the patients, but dysfunction of the blood-CSF barrier was found in 35%. CSF findings were normal in 23%."

CD008686,0,18062751,0,Treatment of bicalutamide-induced breast events.,"Bicalutamide is a competitive nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist. In the European Union and a number of other countries, bicalutamide 150 mg per day is approved as an adjuvant to primary treatments (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy) or as monotherapy as an alternative to surgical or medical castration in men with locally advanced, nonmetastatic prostate cancer. The ongoing bicalutamide Early Prostate Cancer (EPC) program has shown that breast events, defined as gynecomastia, breast pain or both, are a significant limitation of bicalutamide. Nearly 90% of patients experienced one or both symptoms and nearly 16% of patients withdrew from the EPC program as a consequence of bicalutamide-induced breast events. Tamoxifen, anastrozole and radiotherapy have all been studied as options for the treatment of breast events. To date, tamoxifen appears to be the superior agent in terms of outcomes; however, further studies are still required to determine the optimal dose and timing of tamoxifen administration for both prophylaxis and treatment. In addition, the impact on prostate cancer control remains uncertain. An ongoing clinical trial using toremifene to prevent morphometric vertebral fractures in men undergoing medical and/or surgical castration will provide some additional data on the effects of selective estrogen receptor modulators in men with prostate cancer."

CD008686,0,18060011,0,Ankylosing spondylitis: recent breakthroughs in diagnosis and treatment.,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is generally easy to diagnose when the characteristic findings of the ""bamboo"" spine and fused sacroiliac joints are present on radiographs. Unfortunately, these changes are usually seen late in the disease after tremendous suffering has been incurred by the patient. Diagnostic delay averages seven to ten years. Historically, once the diagnosis was made, the treatment options were often inadequate or poorly tolerated in many individuals. This condition most often starts in early adulthood when people are typically in the earlier stages of their careers, resulting in diminished workforce participation and decreased quality of life. If an individual has a family physician, this might be the first encounter with a healthcare provider. Quite often, the initial practitioner is sought at a public walk-in clinic or chiropractic office. In recent years, there have been two major developments in the management of AS that make earlier diagnosis possible and offer the hope of alleviating pain and preventing structural changes that result in loss of function. These developments include the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize the inflammatory changes in the sacroiliac joint and the axial spine, and the demonstration that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocking agents are highly efficacious in reducing spinal inflammation and possibly in slowing radiographic progression. This review outlines diagnostic strategies that can help identify AS in its earlier stages. Special attention is focused on treatment advances, including the use of anti-TNF agents, and how these medications have been incorporated into clinical recommendations for daily use."
CD008686,0,18058082,0,[Chronic spinal subdural hematoma].,"Compared with spinal epidural hematomas, spinal subdural hematomas are rare; chronic forms are even more uncommon. These hematomas are associated not only with lumbar puncture and spinal trauma, but also with coagulopathies, vascular malformations and tumors. Compression of the spinal cord and the cauda equina means that the patients develop increasing back or radicular pain, followed by paraparesis and bladder and bowel paralysis, so that in most cases surgical decompression is carried out. On magnetic resonance imaging these hematomas present as thoracic or lumbar subdural masses, their signal intensity varying with the age of the hematoma. We report the clinical course and the findings revealed by imaging that led to the diagnosis in three cases of chronic spinal subdural hematoma."

Data from this review were compared with those obtained from the same institution 10 years earlier (covering the period 1988-1995) and from other reported series. There were 69 male and 48 female patients aged from 13 to 87 years old (mean age, 51.9). The most common pathologic findings were metastasis in 45.3% (53/117), nerve sheath tumors in 28.2% (33/117), meningiomas in 12% (14/117) and neuroepithelial tumors in 6% (7/117). The peak ages at diagnosis were 41-50 years and 61-70 years. A slight male predominance was noted for all tumors, except meningiomas. Motor weakness, even paralysis, was the major clinical presentation (64-86%), followed by sensory deficits (50%) and pain (42%). The location of tumors was most often in the thoracic (50.4%; 59/117), lumbosacral (27.4%; 32/117) and cervical spine (22.2%; 26/117) segments. Among the metastatic tumors, the lung (22.6%) and breast (15.1%) were the most common primary sites of origin, followed by unknown origin, the liver (hepatocellular carcinoma), the gastrointestinal tract and the nasopharynx (nasopharyngeal cancer)."
CD008686,0,18036691,0,Outcome of early detection and radiotherapy for occult spinal cord compression.,Retrospective analysis in 150 patients with metastatic prostate cancer was conducted to determine whether early detection with MRI spine and treatment of clinically occult spinal cord compromise (SCC) facilitate preservation of neurologic function. Our results suggest that prophylactic radiotherapy for patients with back pain or radiological SCC without neurologic deficit may facilitate preservation of neurologic function. Thus MRI surveillance for SCC may be important for prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.

CD008686,0,18034001,0,Indications and range of surgery in the treatment of spine metastatic tumours.,"Background. Spine is the most common place of metastatic tumors in the skeletal system. Due to diagnostic problems and the risk of quickly increasing neurological defects, the treatment of metastatic spine tumors is a significant clinical problem. The goal of surgical treatment is decreasing pain, neurological improvement and achieving full spinal stability. <br /> Material and methods. Material consists of 31 patients with metastases in spine, who underwent spine surgery. Tumors were placed in thoracic spine at 48% patients, at lumbar spine - 42% patients, and at cervical spine in 10% patients; one level was involved in 56% cases, two or more levels - in 44 % cases. Qualification for surgery contained: the type of primary tumor, the amount of metastases to the spine impairment of spinal biomechanics and overall patient's condition of the. Corporectomy with anterior stabilization (intervertebral cage) was performed at 13 patients, and with additional anterior implants at 2 cases. At 8 patients, with destabilization of posterior spinal column, in spite of corporectomy, posterior stabilization was done. Surgery from posterior approach was performed in 3 cases. <br /> Results. After operation, we noted pain relief at 34% of patients, while in 14% of them transient increase of pain occurred. Neurological status worsened after surgery at 1 patient. We achieved proper spine stabilization, without the need of use of external orthoses at 30 patients. At one patients, reoperation with change of implants and the range of stabilization was necessary. The amount of complications correlated with patient's general condition at the time of surgery.<br /> Conclusions. 1. The main condition of success in operative treatment of spinal metastatic tumors is individual patient's qualification for surgery, including the extent of disease and general patient's condition. 2. Good stabilization with use of implants is a necessary element of surgery of spinal metastases from both anterior and posterior approach."
CD008686,0,18033050,0,[Favorable outcome of acute porphyric neuropathy after treatment with heme arginate].,"Neurologic disorders represent the most severe complications of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). Cognitive disturbances, bulbar and spinal weakness appear as the most critical neurological complications as they may lead to death or definitive motor weakness. A 38-year-old woman was admitted for an acute and painful tetra paresis occurring after a laparoscopy for an ovarian cyst. She also complained of abdominal pain treated with noramidopyrine, tachycardia, hypertension and hyponatremia. The electrophysiological examination showed a motor axonal neuropathy. The increase of Urine ALA at 268 micromol/l (N<38) and of at 235 micromol/l (N<5) strongly suggested AIP that was further confirmed by PBG desaminase deficiency in red cells. Thanks to the prescription of heme arginate (HA) at the dose of 3 mg/kg/day for 4 days, pain resolved immediately and motor function began to improve since the second day of treatment concurrently to a dramatic decrease of both urine ALA and PBG concentrations. Motor recovery was complete after 12 months of evolution. This case illustrates the potential severity of acute porphyric neuropathy when precipitating factors (noramidopyrine, surgery) are present in previously undiagnosed AIP. Moreover, motor neuronal function improved while HA therapy was initiated 22 days after the clinical onset of weakness. This tempts us to propose HA therapy at any stage of acute porphyric neuropathy."

CD008686,0,18028045,0,Meralgia paresthetica: diagnosis and management strategies.,"Meralgia paresthetica (MP), coined from the Greek words meros (thigh and algos), meaning pain, is a neurological disorder characterized by a localized area of paresthesia and numbness on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. The incidence of MP is more common than often reported in the literature. The etiology of MP includes mechanical factors such as obesity, pregnancy, and other conditions associated with increased intrabdominal pressure, surgery of the spine, and pelvic osteotomy. A coherent history and pertinent physical examination is essential in making the diagnosis; however, red flags such as tumor and lumbar disk herniations must be recognized and appropriately treated. While the diagnosis of MP is essentially a clinical diagnosis, sensory nerve conduction velocity studies are a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool. The management of MP includes treating the underlying cause (if any) and conservative management. Surgery should only be adopted when all nonoperative therapies have failed to manage the condition in an effective manner."
CD008686,0,18025516,0,"Management of chronic low back pain: rationales, principles, and targets of imaging-guided spinal injections.","If low back pain does not improve with conservative management, the cause of the pain must be determined before further therapy is initiated. Information obtained from the patient's medical history, physical examination, and imaging may suffice to rule out many common causes of chronic pain (eg, fracture, malignancy, visceral or metabolic abnormality, deformity, inflammation, and infection). However, in most cases, the initial clinical and imaging findings have a low predictive value for the identification of specific pain-producing spinal structures. Diagnostic spinal injections performed in conjunction with imaging may be necessary to test the hypothesis that a particular structure is the source of pain. To ensure a valid test result, diagnostic injection procedures should be monitored with fluoroscopy, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. The use of controlled and comparative injections helps maximize the reliability of the test results. After a symptomatic structure has been identified, therapeutic spinal injections may be administered as an adjunct to conservative management, especially in patients with inoperable conditions. Therapeutic injections also may help hasten the recovery of patients with persistent or recurrent pain after spinal surgery."

CD008686,0,18001417,0,Metastatic ductal eccrine adenocarcinoma masquerading as an invasive ductal carcinoma of the male breast.,"We report the case of a 38-year-old man with metastatic ductal eccrine adenocarcinoma (DEA) of the left breast responding to 5-flourouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) chemotherapy. He initially presented with a 2-week history of difficulty walking because of bilateral hip and lower back pain. Examination showed an ulcerating cutaneous mass over the left anterior chest wall, left axillary lymphadenopathy and tenderness over the spine. A punch biopsy of the breast lesion resulted in a diagnosis of metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast. He received palliative radiotherapy to the spine and also received six cycles of FEC chemotherapy and was subsequently commenced on tamoxifen and ibandronate. There was a symptomatic and radiological response to the FEC chemotherapy. Referral was subsequently made to our institution where the original punch biopsy was reviewed. This showed tumor cells that were polygonal with darkly stained pleomorphic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and were also localized to areas of fibrotic stroma containing eccrine glands and ducts but did not appear to involve mammary tissue. Immunohistochemical studies showed the tumors to be cytokeratin 7 and gross cystic disease fluid protein-15/prolactin inducible protein negative and estrogen receptor alpha positive. Both the morphological and the immunohistochemical characteristics of the tumor were consistent with a revised diagnosis of DEA rather than IDC. When last reviewed, the patient remains pain free and his disease stable 17 months after his original presentation. This case emphasizes the challenge in discriminating histopathologically between two rare tumors of the male breast, namely DEA and IDC. In addition, clinical response to FEC by metastatic DEA has not been previously documented, and this therapeutic regimen warrants further investigation."

CD008686,0,17997704,0,Trigeminal neuralgia: for one nerve a multitude of treatments.,"Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is reputed to be one of the most painful conditions in human experience. Thus, many treatments, both medical and surgical, have been developed for this relapsing and remitting, paroxysmal stabbing or electrical, facial pain syndrome. The likely etiology in many cases is vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone, leading to focal demyelination and aberrant neural discharges. MRI may disclose neurovascular contact, although not with sufficient sensitivity or specificity to substitute for careful clinical diagnosis. In treating TN, antiepileptic drugs are superior to traditional analgesics. Carbamazepine is the first choice drug. Additional drugs for which there is evidence of efficacy include oxcarbazepine, baclofen, gabapentin, lamotrigine and phenytoin. Many patients eventually experience tachyphylaxis or may not tolerate effective doses. Surgical options include: microvascular decompression; balloon compression; radiofrequency thermocoagulation or glycerol rhizotomies; and subcutaneous alcohol branch blockade. Stereotactic gamma knife radiosurgery is a further option. Motor cortex stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, although having shown initial promise for trigeminal neuropathic pain, seem to be ineffective for classical TN. The choice of drug, whether or when to operate, and which procedure to choose should be individualized to the particular needs and conditions of the patient."

A 16-yr-old girl diagnosed as having primary SS at 8 yr of age presented headache and vomiting. CSF studies revealed lymphocyte-dominant pleocytosis and high IgM index, but no evidence of infection. Disturbed consciousness and diffuse slow waves on electroencephalogram led to the diagnosis of SS-meningoencephalitis. The clinical condition subsided after a cycle of dexamethasone therapy, however, 2 months later urinary retention and paresthesia of the lower body developed. Craniospinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive intraparenchymal lesions with high T2-weighted signal intensity adjacent to the posterior left horn of lateral ventricle of the brain and the longitudinal lesion from C5 to T10 of the spinal cord. High-dose methyl-prednisolone and subsequent tacrolimus therapy has effectively controlled the activity of SS-meningoencephalomyelitis. Monitoring of systemic and CSF cytokine levels during the course of illness revealed that CSF interleukin-6, but not interferon-gamma or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were the sensitive indicator of disease activity. The unique cytokine profile, differing from those of infectious meningitis may be useful for predicting the central nervous system involvement in autoimmune disease."

CD008686,0,17983127,0,Clinical indications for simultaneous TMJ and orthognathic surgery.,"There are many temporomandibular joint (TMJ) conditions that can cause pain, TMJ and jaw dysfunction, and disability. The most common of these conditions include: (1) articular disk dislocation; (2) reactive arthritis; (3) adolescent internal condylar resorption; (4) condylar hyperplasia; (5) osteochondroma or osteoma; and (6) end-stage TMJ pathology. These conditions are often associated with dentofacial deformities, malocclusion, TMJ pain, headaches, myofascial pain, TMJ and jaw functional impairment, ear symptoms, etc. Patients with these conditions may benefit from corrective surgical intervention. Open joint surgery provides direct access to the TMJ allowing manipulation, repair, removal and/or reconstruction of the anatomical structures that cannot be accomplished by other treatment methods. TMJ surgery and orthognathic surgery can be predictably performed during one operation with high success rates. This paper discusses the most common TMJ pathologies and presents the surgical management considerations to correct the specific TMJ conditions and associated jaw deformities."

Because they are so rare, their exact origin and details of the clinical manifestations are still unknown. The authors report on five men treated for discal cysts. The mean age of the patients at the time of the surgery was 32 years (range 25-38 years). All patients suffered from lower-extremity pain and the results of the straight leg-raising test were positive in all cases. Three patients reported motor weakness and four had sensory disturbance--symptoms similar to those found in patients with lumbar disc herniation. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated spherically shaped extradural lesions of various sizes with low and high signal intensities on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. Discography revealed obvious communication between the cyst and the intervertebral disc with reproducible leg pain in all patients. All patients underwent posterior decompression and excision of the cysts either with or without additional discectomy. The radicular symptoms were remarkably improved in all patients immediately after surgery, and no recurrent lesions were noted during follow up."

Syndromatic integration through radiological clinical correlation].,"Cervical spine dysmorphisms (CSD) occurs in an heterogeneous group of patients unified by the presence of congenital defects result from malalignment, formation or segmentation of the cervical spine; generating disability. This problem requires comprehensive evaluation of patients with scoliosis diagnosis, correlating clinical and radiological findings and the presence of numerous abnormalities of other systems in order to give an opportunely syndrome diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of this patients with the aim to give them an integral rehabilitation treatment increasing their quality of life. In this study we described clinical and radiological findings in children with CSD diagnosis. We studied 47 consecutive outpatients of Pediatric Rehabilitation Division in Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitaci6n (INR) with scoliosis diagnosis. Sixteen patients (34%) had CSD diagnosis. Most frequently syndromes (Sx) were: Klippel-Feil Sx (19%), Wildervanck (4.3%), neurofibromatosis (4.3%), Morquio (2.1%), Stickler (2.1%) and Williams (2.1%).

A 75-year-old man had a history of falling due to weakness of his left lower limb. MRI revealed a well-defined oval mass in the conus medullaris. The tumor had an isointense signal relative to spinal cord on T1-weighted images, hyperintense signal areas intermixed with punctate spots of hypointensity on T2-weighted images, and heterogeneous obvious enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images. Associated abnormally tortuous vessels were noted in the dura proximal to the tumor. Histological findings were compatible with the diagnosis of hemangioblastoma. Hemangioblastoma should be included in the differential diagnosis in patients with an enhancing tumor and adjacent engorged vessels of the spinal cord."
CD008686,0,17927931,0,Interventional therapies for cancer pain management: important adjuvants to systemic analgesics.,"Optimized use of systemic analgesics fails to adequately control pain in some patients with cancer. Commonly used analgesics, including opioids, nonopioids (acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjuvant analgesics (anticonvulsants and antidepressants), have limited analgesic efficacy, and their use is often associated with adverse effects. Without adequate pain control, patients with cancer not only experience the anguish of poorly controlled pain but also have greatly diminished quality of life and may even have reduced life expectancy. Interventional pain therapies are a diverse set of procedural techniques for controlling pain that may be useful when systemic analgesics fail to provide adequate control of cancer pain or when the adverse effects of systemic analgesics cannot be managed reasonably. Commonly used interventional therapies for cancer pain include neurolytic neural blockade, spinal administration of analgesics, and vertebroplasty. Compared with systemic analgesics, which generally have broad indications for control of pain, individual interventional therapies generally have specific, narrow indications. When appropriately selected and implemented, interventional pain therapies are important components of broad, multimodal cancer pain management that significantly increases the proportion of patients able to experience adequate pain control."

While avulsion fractures to the anterior superior iliac spine, the iliac crest and the pubic bone are common, injuries to the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) are only rarely encountered. We report on two 42 and 43-year old male soccer players complaining of groin pain. Both had AIIS avulsion fractures diagnosed by conventional plain x-ray of the pelvis, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. One patient had an acute adductor longus muscle injury with concomitant asymptomatic AIIS avulsion fracture. Conservative treatment of the muscle injury with initial RICE therapy followed by pain-restricted jogging brought him back to sport within four weeks. The other patient had local tenderness and exercise pain at AIIS with a large exostosis on imaging studies mimicking a pseudotumor. Surgical resection was applied and the rectus femoris muscle was reattached. After three months of intensive physical therapy he could be return to sport. Avulsion fractures of the AIIS may cause persistent pain syndrome and mimic a pseudotumor decades after the initial trauma, which can be treated by surgical resection and reattachment of the rectus femoris muscle with good results. Conservative treatment for minor dislocated AIIS avulsion fractures can be effective in sportsmen. Differential diagnosis often involves bony tumors, so patient's soccer history gives important information regarding past avulsion fractures of the pelvis, which often occur during kicking in the adolescence."

CD008686,0,17883186,0,Elective neck dissection in oral carcinoma: a critical review of the evidence.,"More than 50% of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity have lymph node metastases and histological confirmation of metastatic disease is the most important prognostic factor. Among patients with a clinically negative neck, the incidence of occult metastases varies with the site, size and thickness of the primary tumour. The high incidence rate of occult cervical metastases (> 20%) in tumours of the lower part of the oral cavity is the main argument in favour of elective treatment of the neck. The usual treatment of patients with clinically palpable metastatic lymph nodes has been radical neck dissection. This classical surgical procedure involves not only resection of level I to V lymph nodes of the neck but also the tail of the parotid, submandibular gland, sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein and spinal accessory nerve. It is a safe oncological surgical procedure that significantly reduces the risk of regional recurrences, however it produces significant post-operative morbidity, mainly shoulder dysfunction. Aiming to reduce morbidity, Ward and Roben described a modification of the procedure sparing the spinal accessory nerve to prevent post-operative shoulder morbidity. Several clinical and pathological studies have demonstrated that the pattern of metastatic lymph node metastases occurs in a predictable fashion in patients with oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma. The use of selective supraomohyoid neck dissection as the elective treatment of the neck, in oral cancer patients, is now well established. However, its role in the treatment of clinically positive neck patients is controversial. Some Authors advocate this type of selective neck dissection in patients with limited neck disease at the upper levels of the neck, without jeopardizing neck control. The main factors supporting this approach are the usually good prognosis in patients with single levels I or II metastasis independent of the extent of neck dissection, and the low rates of level V involvement in oral cavity tumours. Furthermore, the high incidence of clinically false-positive lymph nodes in oral cavity cancer patients is well recognized. In selected cases, supraomohyoid dissection could be extended to level IV, and followed by radiotherapy when indicated. Several reports have confirmed the usefulness of minimally invasive sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma and breast tumours. However, only preliminary data testing the feasibility of the method exist regarding the management of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The complexity of lymphatic drainage and the presence of deep lymphatics of the neck make application of this method difficult. This attractive concept has recently been explored by several investigators who examined the feasibility of identifying the sentinel lymph node in primary echelons of drainage from oral cavity squamous carcinoma. The current knowledge of sentinel lymph node biopsy does not allow avoiding the indication of elective neck dissection in clinical practice. Sentinel lymph node biopsy cannot be considered the standard of care at this time. However, there are multi-institutional clinical trials testing this approach. Management of occult neck node metastasis continues to be a matter of debate. The role of imaging methods such as ultrasound-guided needle biopsy, sentinel node biopsy and positron emission tomography-computed tomography are still being evaluated as alternatives to elective neck dissections. Whether one of these techniques will change the current management of cervical node metastasis remains to be proved in prospective multi-institutional trials."

We studied a consecutive series of 126 patients with CSS, defined as involvement of 2 or more of the third, fourth, fifth (V1, V2), or sixth cranial nerves, or involvement of only 1 of them in combination with a neuroimaging-confirmed lesion in the cavernous sinus. Tumors were the most common cause of CSS (80 patients). All patients with optic nerve involvement had a tumor. No patient with a normal MRI had a tumor. The lack of pain during the course of the disease (odds ratio [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.06-0.40), V2 involvement (OR, 12.17; 95% CI, 2.98-49.71), and male sex (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.31-8.14) were independently associated with the presence of a tumor.

CD008686,0,17870234,0,Demyelinating plaque imitates an intramedullary tumour.,"An isolated spinal demyelinating lesion is very rare and almost always associated with multiple sclerosis. There are only a few reports of biopsy or resection of MS-associated lesions. Sometimes the radiological and the histopathological findings can lead to a false diagnosis of a tumour. A 15-year-old girl presented with a progressive spastic tetraparesis and various associated clinical symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested a possible intramedullary tumour extending from C4 to C7 and the need for surgical intervention. There was no previous neurological or other history and the brain MRI was normal. The performing surgeons based their procedures on oncological criteria. The extracted lesion was finally diagnosed as a demyelinating plaque. The postoperative course was uneventful without deterioration of the neurological status and the young patient improved completely after 4-months of rehabilitation. After an 8-year follow-up, the patient remains in remission and free of neurological defects. Apart from the radiological findings, the CSF exam as well as the evoked potentials does not suggest a diagnosis of MS. A demyelinating plaque in the cervical spinal cord can occasionally imitate a cervical intramedullary tumour leading to an operation. Such lesions underscore the sensitivity of present-day lesion detection procedures. An addition of a MS work up could be beneficial in some cases of intramedullary tumours without a typical history, although in the case presented this type of workup was negative."

CD008686,0,17683649,0,Efficacy and safety of intravenous bisphosphonates in patients with bone metastases caused by metastatic breast cancer.,"Solid tumors frequently metastasize to bone. This results in debilitating skeletal complications such as intractable bone pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. Patients frequently require palliative radiation therapy or orthopedic surgery. Bisphosphonates have been shown to delay the incidence and decrease the frequency of skeletal-related events. Zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate that has provided benefits for patients with bone metastases secondary to a broad range of solid tumors. Among patients with metastatic breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid has demonstrated significant reductions in pain and skeletal morbidity compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid has also shown significant reductions in skeletal morbidity in patients with lung cancer or other solid tumors compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid is generally well tolerated. Flu-like symptoms which are manageable with standard treatment can occur. Renal monitoring is recommended, with dose reductions for patients with renal dysfunction.

TSI is the complete left-to-right inversion of the thoracic and abdominal organs. It develops due to an abnormal rotation of the cardiac tube during embryogenesis, the mechanism of which is of unknown mechanism. Syringomyelia (SM) is an uncommon disease of the spinal cord and is known as the occurrence of a cystic space in the middle of the spinal cord. SM occurs due to spinal cord injury, a primary tumor of the spinal cord, or an extramedullary lesion at the foramen magnum such as a Chiari type 1 malformation (CM1).

The treatment of both benign and malignant osseous spinal tumors is basically surgical. Simple curettage or resection is appropriate for the management of benign tumors. Although a curative wide resection is optimal for the malignant tumor, it is not unusual that only the marginal or intralesional resection is indicated because of the highly progressed stage of the tumor.

CD008686,0,17762848,0,The assessment of ankylosing spondylitis in clinical practice.,"Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that predominantly affects the axial skeleton in adolescent patients causing spinal pain and stiffness. There is a marked delay, on average 8 years, between onset of disease symptoms and clinical diagnosis. The distinction between the symptoms of mechanical and inflammatory back pain remains one of the main contributing factors for the delay in diagnosis. Several classification criteria exist to aid the diagnosis of AS, but their accuracy is poor. The Ankylosing Spondylitis Assessment Study group (ASAS) has defined a core set of domains for clinical outcome measurement in AS in order to assess the disease process in individual patients and to identify those with rapidly progressive disease. New therapies, such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, have transformed the treatment paradigm in AS, especially for those patients with aggressive disease. Thus, the definition of both patient selection criteria for these agents and the development of clinical methods to assess response to therapy have become a priority. This Review focuses on measuring the degree of disease activity, function and damage in patients with AS in an ambulatory care setting, and the assessment of suitability of various outcome measures for monitoring response to treatment with TNF inhibitors."

A 48-yr-old woman presented with a 2-month history of a relapsed oral ulcer, progressive dyspnea, and a thoracic pain induced by breathing. A tumorous mass was noticed in the right costodiaphragmatic recess on chest computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and the patient underwent a right costotransversectomy with excision of the tumor, which originated from the 12th intercostal nerve. Histology and immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor was an IMT of the intercostal nerve. The patient's postoperative course was not favorable; dyspnea persisted after surgery, and a progressive pulmonary compromise developed. The cause of the respiratory failure was found to be bronchiolitis obliterans, which in this case proved to be a fatal complication of paraneoplastic pemphigus associated with an IMT. This case of IMT of the spinal nerve in the paravertebral region is unique in terms of its location and presentation in combination with paraneoplastic pemphigus, which is rare. A brief review of the heterogeneous theories concerning the pathogenesis, clinicopathological features, and differential diagnosis of this disease entity is presented."

CD008686,0,17691360,0,Spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of chronic non-malignant pain.,"Over the past four decades, techniques and devices for spinal cord stimulation have undergone considerable refinement. Currently, percutaneous implantable electrodes are placed in the epidural space and a low-frequency electrical current is used to modify the transmission of chronic pain signals in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Before permanent implantation, the spinal cord stimulation will be examined during a test phase to determine its analgesic effect and tolerability. We have reviewed our experience in 88 patients with chronic nonmalignant pain. The follow-up of our study ranged from 15 to 75 months, with an average of 60 months. The indication for SCS in these 88 patients was mainly neuropathic pain syndromes. The patients were followed up by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), level of activity and subjective assessment of the quality of life. On the basis of the patients' self-assessments using the VAS, the degree of pain relief was excellent/good in 72 of 88 patients (82%). At the end of the follow-up period, 50% of the patients were in a better psychological status and 86% of the patients reported an improvement in activities of their daily living and a reduction in the use of analgesic medication. Ninety percent of the patients stated that they would go through the procedure again for the same result. The findings of the present study indicate that spinal cord stimulation is an efficacious therapy for the treatment of chronic non-malignant pain."
CD008686,0,17691355,0,Intrathecal opioids for intractable pain syndromes.,"For more than 20 years intrathecal opioid application with implantable pumps is an option for selected patients with malignant as well as non-malignant pain. In general, most types of pain should be treatable by opioid medication. However, the associated systemic side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation or the risk of suppression of the central nervous system hinder the application of oral or intravenous opioid therapy as a sole, widely applicable treatment. Causes of non-malignant pain that may represent an indication for intrathecal drug-delivery systems include: failed back syndrome, neuropathic pain, axial spinal pain, complex regional pain syndrome, diffuse pain, brachial plexitis, central pain, failed spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy, arachnoiditis, poststroke pain, spinal cord injury pain and peripheral neuropathy. Due to the proximity to the receptor sites, the therapeutic effect of intrathecal drug application lasts longer and the rate of systemic side effects is reduced. Before definitive pump implantation, the therapeutic effect of intrathecal opioid therapy is tested with an external pump. If there is no clear and satisfactory effect in this trial application, pump implantation is not indicated. In our patients, with a follow-up exceeding 3 years, the reduction of non-malignant pain (assessed with the Visual Analogue Scale, VAS) was good or excellent (pain decrease >50%) in 71.3% of the patients, fair (VAS 5-6) in 19.8% and poor (VAS 7-10) in 8.9%. After 3 years of continuous treatment, we observed catheter-related technical problems (catheter dislocation, obstruction, kinking, disconnection or rupture) in 17 of 165 patients. Pump malfunctions were very rare (8 of 165 cases) and limited to older pump types. Reversible, specific drug-related side effects of long-term therapy with intrathecal pumps developed in 32 of the 165 patients. In our series, the mean serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration ratio for morphine was 1/3000, which explains the low rate of systemic side effects. Local diffusion difficulties in CSF cause an uneven distribution of morphine in CSF. Therefore the clinical effect is markedly influenced by the position of the catheter tip, a fact that should be kept in mind during catheter implantation. Intrathecal drug application is cost effective and can significantly improve the quality of life in selected patients. An intensive training in this method and awareness of its specific complications is necessary for everyone to participate in the consulting and implanting team. Pumps for chronic intrathecal opioid application should only be implanted in specialized centers."
CD008686,0,17691288,0,Motor cortex stimulation for chronic non-malignant pain: current state and future prospects.,"Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) was proposed by Tsubokawa in 1991 for the treatment of post-stroke thalamic pain. Since that time, the indications have been increased and included trigeminal neuropathic pain and later other types of central and peripheral deafferentation pain. The results reported in the literature are quite good; the mean long-term success rate is 80% in facial pain and 53% in non-facial pain. Our own results are less impressive: 4 of 14 patients (28%) experienced a greater than 40% pain relief, but in 2 of them the effect faded with time. Only few minor complications have been reported. The accurate placement of the epidural electrode over the motor cortex that somatotopically corresponds to the painful area is believed to be essential for pain relief. Predictive factors included the response to pharmacological tests, the relative sparing from the disease process of the cortico-spinal tract and the sensory system, and the analgesic response achieved during the test period of MCS. A possible predictive factor might be a test of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the motor cortex. MCS may act by rebalancing the control of non-nociceptive sensory inputs over nociceptive afferents at cortical, thalamic, brainstem and spinal level. In addition, it may interfere with the emotional component of nociceptive perception. Biochemical processes involving endorphins and GABA may also be implicated in the mechanism of MCS. It is time for a large multicenter prospective randomized double blind study evaluating not only the effect of MCS on pain (based on the available guidelines for assessment of neuropathic pain), but also the optimal electrode placement and stimulation parameters, and the possible relationship with the response to rTMS. New electrode design and a new generation of stimulators may help in improving the results."

The authors present a detailed characterization of a spinal epidural hemangioma in a 30-year-old woman who presented with complaints of gradual onset of low-back pain that worsened over 1 year. The MR imaging findings indicated a large L2-S1 epidural spinal mass causing thecal sac compression. The patient underwent an L2-S1 laminectomy, and a vascular extradural mass was noted on the posterior aspect of the dura mater. Preoperative spinal angiography as well as intraoperative angiography was performed. Total resection of the tumor was achieved using intraoperative embolization with sodium tetradecyl sulfate and microscopic dissection. The postoperative MR imaging findings and clinical outcome were excellent. The findings and use of sodium tetradecyl sulfate in gross-total resection are discussed. The authors also review treatment modalities and demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of intraoperative sodium tetradecyl sulfate in grosstotal resection of large difficult spinal epidural hemangiomas."

The diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma was confirmed by biopsy specimens of the right supraclavicular lymph node. The clinical stage was IIIB, and the prognostic score was 3. Plasma levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were elevated to 446 pg/mL, and 1,710 pg/mL,respectively. Six-course combination chemotherapy with the ABVD regimen was initiated,and a complete response (CR) was achieved. Clinical signs disappeared and plasma levels of IL-6 and VEGF decreased to 5.0 pg/mL and 100 pg/mL, respectively. The patient remained in CR as of December 2006. Elevated IL-6 and VEGF may be appropriate tumor markers for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma."
CD008686,0,17682223,0,[Experience with endoscopic interventions in diseases of the vertebral column].,"The paper analyzes the results of treatment for various diseases of the vertebral column, by applying endoscopic technologies. Group 1 included 5 patients with cervical hernias appeared as cervical radiculopathy. Group 2 comprised patients with diseases of the thoracic vertebral column, including 8 patients with discal hernias, 6 with primary or metastatic lesions of the thoracic vertebrae, 2 with sympathalgia, and 5 with uncomplicated thoracic vertebral body fractures. Group 3 consisted of 86 patients with lumbosacral hernias, of whom 33 patients were endoscopically operated on and the remaining 53 patients made up a control group and were microsurgically operated on. The clinical findings were analyzed by using the current scales and questionnaires to make an objective assessment of subjective index, such as pain syndrome. A preliminary comparison of endoscopic and microscopic surgical treatments for diseases and lesions of the vertebral column demonstrate the noticeable advantages of endoscopic technology. Further development of neuroendoscopy in spinal neurosurgical care is expected to substantially enhance the efficiency of treatment due to the lower traumaticity rates of surgical interventions. Furthermore, mastering endoscopictechniques in surgery of bone tumors, but also spinal cord extra- and intramedullary neoplasms is promising, as considered by the authors."

CD008686,0,17669655,0,A ligamentum flavum hematoma presenting as an L5 radiculopathy.,"This study reports two patients with ligamentum flavum hematoma, of which only seven cases have been reported in the literature. Two elderly male patients (74 and 80 years) presented with a history of chronic lumbar strain and effort. They had low back pain radiating to both legs. Their neurologic examination findings were consistent with left L5 root compression. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an epidural mass lesion at L4-L5 that was continuous with the ligamentum flavum. After removal of the hematoma, the symptoms completely resolved. The most common cystic lesion in the lumbar spine is synovial cyst associated with the facet joints, but ligamentum flavum hematoma should be included in the differential diagnosis. The clinical, radiological and surgical features are described. Surgery should be the treatment of choice to resolve symptoms in ligamentum flavum hematoma."
CD008686,0,17668943,0,Versatility of the Novalis system to deliver image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for various anatomical sites.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) programs to treat brain tumors were implemented when we first acquired the Brainlab Novalis system in 2003. Two years later, we started an extra-cranial stereotactic radio-ablation or more appropriately a stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) program using the Brainlab Novalis image-guided system at The Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas. We hereby summarize our initial experience with this system in delivering image-guided SBRT to a total of 80 patients during our first year of clinical implementation, from February 2005 to January 2006. Over 100 lesions in more than 20 distinct anatomical sites were treated. These include all levels of spine from cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral lesions. Spinal lesions encompass intramedullary, intradural, extradural, or osseous compartments. Also treated were lesions in other bony sites including orbit, clavicle, scapula, humerus, sternum, rib, femur, and pelvis (ilium, ischium, and pubis). Primary or metastatic lesions located in the head and neck, supraclavicular region, axilla, mediastinum, lung (both central and peripheral), abdominal wall, liver, kidney, para-aortic lymph nodes, prostate, and pelvis were also treated. In addition to primary radiotherapy, SBRT program using the Brainlab Novalis system allows re-irradiation for recurrence and ""boost"" after conventional treatment to various anatomical sites. Treating these sites safely and efficaciously requires knowledge in radiation tolerance, fraction size, total dose, biologically equivalent dose (BED), prior radiotherapy, detailed dose volume histograms (DVH) of normal tissues, and the radiosensitive/radioresistant nature of the tumor. Placement of radio-opaque markers (Visicoil, Radiomed) in anatomical sites not in close proximity to bony landmarks (e.g., kidney and liver) helps in measuring motion and providing image guidance during each treatment fraction. Tumor/organ motion data obtained using 4D-CT while the patient is immobilized in the body cast aids in planning treatment margin and determining the need for respiratory motion control, e.g., abdominal compressor, gating, or active breathing control. The inclusion of PET/CT to the Brainlab treatment planning system further refines the target delineation and possibly guides differential fraction size prescription and delivery. The majority of the patients tolerated the SBRT treatment well despite the longer daily treatment time when compared to that of conventional treatment. All patients achieved good pain relief after SBRT. Compared to conventional standard radiotherapy of lower daily fraction size, we observed that the patients achieved faster pain relief and possibly more durable symptom control. Very high local control with stable disease on imaging was observed post SBRT. Our initial experience shows that the Brainlab Novalis system is very versatile in delivering image-guided SBRT to various anatomical sites. This SBRT approach can be applied to either primary or metastatic lesions in the primary, ""boost,"" or re-irradiation settings. The understanding of fraction size, total dose, BED, and DVH of normal tissues is very important in the treatment planning. Appropriate use of immobilization devices, radio-opaque markers for image-guidance, 4D-CT for tumor/organ motion estimates, and fusion of planning CT scans with biological/functional imaging will further improve the planning and delivery of SBRT, hopefully leading to better treatment outcome."
CD008686,0,17662364,0,Hemangioblastoma of filum terminale associated with arteriovenous shunting.,"Spinal arteriovenous shunt typically presents in middle age or in the elderly with a strong male predilection. The clinical presentation is usually progressive neurological deficits such as paraparesis or incontinence due to cord edema, although back pain is also a common presentation. Progress of neurological deficit is typically stopped by occlusion of the shunt (surgically or endovascularly), but the return of loss of function may be found in less than half of these patients. In contrast, spinal hemangioblastomas usually occur in adults, and the most common presentation is pain with radiculopathy. Location in the filum terminale is very rare."

Clinical feature of a case of PTCL-U was investigated and the optimal treatment protocol was proposed. The clinical presentation of this case was progressing limbs weakness with sudden paralysis. Multiple superficial lymph nodes swelling and decreased sensation in all modalities below T10 level were found in physical examination. Bilateral leg paralysis (Grade 0/5) with high muscle tension, overactive knee reflex, bilateral Babinski sign (+) were present. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) showed the mass, which was around spinal cord located in T6-T8 vertebra canal, with intense enhancement after the administration of gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid. Abnormal signal in multiple centrum and accessories could also be found in MRI scan. Initial diagnosis was lymphoma, multiple systems involved. Laminectomy and epidural tumor resection were performed immediately. The dural sac was narrowed obviously by surrounding tumor. The result of pathological examination was PTCL-U. After operation, the level of pain sensation was descent, and touch sensation recovered. The patient received chemotherapy and his muscle strength was partly recovered in 4 months. Early diagnosis of peripheral T cell lymphomas-unspecified was difficult and easily misdiagnosed with poor prognosis. A review of literature showed central nervous system lesions occurred in advanced stage. However, the report of representation of intraspinal mass as initial symptom like the case was rare. For acute paraplegia, laminectomy and tumor resection should be performed as soon as possible. Regular radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be considered after operation. However, the value of local chemotherapy need to be further investigated."

CD008686,0,17641744,0,FDG-PET Lacks Sufficient Sensitivity to Detect Myxoid Liposarcoma Spinal Metastases Detected by MRI.,"Purpose. To document a case of myxoid liposarcoma in which PET scan was less sensitive than MRI in detecting spinal metastasis. Materials and Methods. The case of a 65-year-old female with a history of myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) of the thigh resected 5 years previously and now presenting with low back pain is presented. Her medical oncologist ordered an FDG-PET scan to evaluate distant recurrence. Subsequently, an MRI of her spine was obtained by her surgeon. Results. The FDG-PET scan was obtained 1 week prior to the MRI, and it did not show increased glucose uptake in the spine. Her MRI did show increased signal intensity in her lumbar spine. CT needle biopsy confirmed the lesion to be metastatic MLS. Conclusion. FDG-PET scans are utilized to detect distant recurrence of cancerous lesions. Myxoid liposarcoma has a unique propensity to metastasize to the spine. Previous reports have documented the unreliability of bone scintigraphy to diagnose these metastases. Our report demonstrates that FDG-PET may also lack the sensitivity needed to detect these lesions. We advocate total spine MRI when screening for metastases in this population when they present with back pain."

CD008686,0,17633497,0,Palliative dual iliac screw fixation for lumbosacral metastasis. Technical note.,"Spinal fixation for destructive metastatic lesions at the lumbosacral junction is challenging because of the large and unique load-bearing characteristics present. In particular, caudal fixation is difficult in cases of sacral destruction because of insufficient S-1 pedicle screw anchorage. The authors describe their surgical technique for secure iliac screw placement and the clinical results obtained in five patients with metastatic spinal disease. All patients in this study underwent palliative operations with dual iliac screw fixation between April 1999 and October 2002, and the clinical and radiological findings were assessed. In all five patients, spinal metastases extended into the sacrum. The metastases were from renal cell carcinomas in two patients, lung cancer in two, and a paraganglioma in one patient. Postoperative follow-up periods ranged from 3 months to 6 years (mean 28.4 months). Preoperatively, four patients could not walk due to severe pain or neurological compromise. Postoperatively, all patients reported a reduction in pain and regained the ability to walk. Complications included one case of early wound infection. In the patients with long survival after the operation, there was one case of iliac screw loosening and one case of rod breakage. The dual iliac screw fixation technique provided sufficient immediate stability for destructive lumbosacral metastasis."
CD008686,0,17630916,0,"Use of radiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.","In 1942, Dr. Seidlin of the Memorial Hospital in New York was faced with a 51-year- old patient who had undergone a thyroidectomy in 1923 [1]. At the time, the histologic diagnosis was a 'malignant adenoma' of the thyroid. In 1938 the patient returned with overt signs of thyroid hyperfunction (hyperthyroidism) and lower back pain. A metastasis was found in the lower spine, and surgically removed. Over the next years the patient remained hyperthyroid and developed more bone metastases. At the time of presentation to Dr. Seidlin, the patient was in an extremely poor condition: he was in severe pain, severely hyperthyroid, and severely underweight. At this time radioiodine therapy had just reached the clinical arena. In 1937 Hertz, Roberts and Evans investigated the rabbit's thyroid function using I-128 [2]. Later they pursued therapeutic goals for e.g. Graves' disease using I-130. They used dosages that we now know would have been merely diagnostic if it were not for a probable 10% I-131 contaminant [3]. Livingood and Seaborg identified I-131 as a separate isotope. In 1942 two groups independently reported on the successful treatment of hyperthyroidism with I-131 sodium iodide [4,5]. Radioiodine was so rare that it was recovered from the urine, purified and re-administered to the patient. The patient responded favourably to the radioiodine treatment, and he received several more courses of I-131. Geiger-counter examination of the patient revealed two previously unknown metastases, thereby indicating the diagnostic capabilities of radioiodine. The patient did very well on these courses: the hyperthyroidism subsided, the body-weight kg increased from 38 to 53 kilograms, and the pains diminished. This report of a potential cure for terminally ill patients fuelled the public imagination to a degree that it hit the political agenda. Effective on August 1, 1946, the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) made radioisotopes available for medical use in the USA. This date marks the beginning of 'atomic medicine', later named nuclear medicine."

The patient had a history of skin ulcer formation on both toes due to poor circulation. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomographic scan revealed a huge retroperitoneal tumor compressing the right kidney. Serum levels of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, aldosterone, adrenalin, noradrenalin, urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, homovanillic acid, 17-ketosteroid and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid were all within normal limits. Combining all preoperative diagnostic information, the possibility of retroperitoneal liposarcoma could not be thoroughly ruled out. The patient consented to undergo resection of the tumor with the right kidney. Prior to the scheduled operation simulation of the positioning on the operation table was done to evaluate the compressing pressure. During operation decompressing pads were used to minimize the compressing pressure and intermittent pneumatic compression was also used to prevent pressure ulcer and facilitate circulation to the lower extremities. Five thousands units of heparin (FragminR, Pfizer, USA) was used daily to prevent deep vein thrombosis until the patient could use his wheelchair. Perioperative rehabilitation was conducted by a team of physical therapists. The excised tumor weighed 1,320 g. Pathologic diagnosis was an adrenal myelolipoma. Convalescence was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 10th post operative day. Between 1992 and 2006, 80 cases of adrenal myelolipoma were reported in Japan. Our case was found to be the second largest one. We reviewed these 80 cases and discussed the diagnosis and treatment strategy of the adrenal myelolipoma. We also discussed the perioperative management for patients with spinal cord injury."

A 41-year-old Hispanic man presented to the emergency department complaining of severe low back pain, cauda equina syndrome, bilateral lower extremity edema, and an extra heart sound on physical examination. CT of the lumbosacral spine done in the emergency department demonstrated a sclerotic lesion in the sacrum with cortical destruction, extension into the spinal canal and a bulky soft tissue mass containing calcifications. Supplemental MRI demonstrated marrow replacement of L4, L5, and the sacrum, soft tissue extension of the tumor, and invasion iliac veins extending into the IVC; however, the full extent of the intravascular tumor was not seen on this examination. Surgical laminectomy and biopsy of the spinal tumor provided the diagnosis of osteogenic sarcoma. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed while the patient was recovering due to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which showed an echogenic mass within the right atrium and ventricle. CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the echocardiogram showing a tumor extending through the pulmonary valve into the main pulmonary artery. The patient underwent en bloc resection of the tumor from the venous and cardiac systems. Histologic examination of the tumor confirmed osteogenic sarcoma. While vertebral osteogenic sarcoma is uncommon, invasion of the spinal canal is common in these tumors. However, tumor extending into the central venous and cardiac system is rare. The previously reported cases of central venous and cardiac involvement have been related to distant metastases or primary cardiac osteosarcomas. There is only one other reported case of direct extension into the venous system by an iliac bone osteosarcoma in an adolescent; however, the tumor did not extend into the pulmonary circulation."

The clinical diagnosis is usually straightforward, but may be delayed for many years in a schwannoma of the posterior tibial nerve. The symptoms are often attributed to entrapment neuropathy or to lumbosacral radiculopathy. We describe 25 patients with a schwannoma of the posterior tibial nerve. Only three were diagnosed within a year of presentation. The mean time to diagnosis was 86.5 months with a median of 48 months (2 to 360). All the patients complained of pain, which was felt specifically in the sole of the foot in 18. A Tinel sign was detected in all 25 patients. MRI confirmed the diagnosis in all the cases in which it had been undertaken. Surgical resection of the lesion abolished the neuropathic pain. In patients with a long history of neuropathic pain in the lower limb in whom lumbar and pelvic lesions have been excluded, a benign tumour of the sheath of a peripheral nerve may explain the symptoms.

Percutaneous vertebroplasty involves the injection of acrylic surgical cement into the vertebral body. The basic principles of vertebroplasty and the authors' own clinical experiences are described. Material and methods. Between November 1999 and January 2005 the authors performed percutaneous vertebroplasty on 75 patients: 45 with osteoporotic compression fractures, 15 with angiomas of the vertebral bodies, and 12 patients with spinal neoplasms. There were also 3 patients with coexisting spinal angiomas and osteoporotic compression fractures. All these patients were treated under local anesthesia. Cement injections were realized by the transpedicular approach under fluoroscopic guidance; in certain cases a CT-guided approach was used. The clinical outcome was assessed based on follow-up examinations, the Oswestry questionnaire, and the Visual Analog Pain Scale. Plain x-rays or CT scans were made for purposes of radiological evaluation. Results. Follow-up examinations revealed pain relief or significant reduction of pain in 89% of the patients.

The choice of treatment method for metastases to the spine remains an unresolved and controversial question. The major complication in disseminated neoplastic disease compression of the spine and nervous elements. Vertebroplasty performed jointly with palliative radiotherapy has been proposed as a procedure to treat metastases complicated by cancer infiltrations in the vicinity of the spine. Material and methods. We examined 21 patients treated since May 2004. Vertebroplasty was performed by surgery using acrylic cement, followed by palliative radiotherapy. Results. Outcome was assessed by clinical examination, neurological evaluation, and other methods, such as X-ray, CT scan, and MRI. All patients showed prompt relief of pain and substantial improvement in mobility. No complications or side effects were observed in connection with the joint palliative treatment. Conclusions. Vertebroplasty is an effective method and works to help stabilize spinal fractures. Satisfactory results were obtained using palliative treatment. The use of acrylic cement made it possible to perform radiotherapy safely with an optimum margin of healthy tissues, which enhances treatment. These initial results point to the need for further clinical collaboration between neurosurgeon and radiotherapist."

Clinical evaluation, neurophysiology and magnetic resonance imaging are common tools in diagnosing lumbosacral radiculopathy. Nevertheless, sometimes tumour may mimic radiculopathy. With the improvement of ultrasound, most peripheral nerves may be virtually identified. We describe two patients where tumour of sural nerve and tibial nerve mimicked S1 radiculopathy.

Patient characteristics, surgical methods, and postoperative course were reviewed. The most common preoperative symptom, painful radiculopathy, occurred in all cases, followed by motor weakness in five, sensory loss in four, and intermittent claudication in four. All patients underwent bilateral total (n = 6) or partial laminectomy (n = 4), with minimal (n = 3) or no (n = 7) facetectomy. Cysts were gross totally resected in eight cases and partially resected in two. Concomitant fixation was not performed. Painful radiculopathy, motor weakness, and sensory disturbance all resolved, resulting in good or excellent outcome in all patients. Postoperative symptomatic spondylolisthesis had not been noted at mean 52.1 months postoperatively. However, new juxtafacet cysts were later detected on the contralateral side to the initial lesion in two patients. Surgical removal of juxtafacet cysts is recommended for immediate symptomatic relief. Concomitant spinal fixation to prevent progression of spinal spondylolisthesis or cyst recurrence depends on cyst size, involvement of surrounding structures, degree of preoperative spondylolisthesis, and facet joint destruction."

CD008686,0,17583467,0,"Hazards for pain severity and pain interference with daily living, with exploration of brief pain inventory cutpoints, among women with metastatic breast cancer.","Few longitudinal studies have assessed risk factors for pain outcomes in tumor-specific populations. Such studies are needed to improve clinical practice guidelines for cancer pain management over the course of treatment. Among patients with metastatic breast cancer, we assessed the impact of baseline clinical and demographic risk factors on patients reaching different pain severity and interference scores. We analyzed data originally collected in a clinical trial of two bisphosphonate therapies. Pain was measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) severity and interference with daily living 0-10 subscales. We fit univariate (per-cutpoint) and multivariate (cutpoints 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the BPI) proportional hazards models to identify predictors of pain outcomes over 51 weeks among 1,124 women with metastatic breast cancer. Predictors included race, age, education, geographic region, performance status, chemotherapy versus hormonal therapy only, time from first bone metastasis to randomization, and previous skeletal-related event (SRE, e.g., fractures, spinal cord compression). Non-Caucasian women had greater hazards for reaching higher cutpoints (5 and above) on the severity scale than Caucasian women (hazard ratio [HR] for cutpoint 5 interaction term=1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.37-2.26). For the interference scale, these hazards were greater for those patients with restricted (versus active) baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (HR for cutpoint 5 interaction term=2.51; 95% CI=2.01-3.13). In the multivariate severity model, other factors associated with higher pain severity were restricted baseline ECOG performance status, previous SRE, and not being employed full-time at baseline (HRs=1.70, 1.23, and 1.33, respectively). Our findings that non-Caucasian race and restricted performance status were associated with greater pain hazards over time confirm previous cross-sectional findings that these characteristics are pain risk factors. Because we found that the most influential demographic and clinical baseline factors had predictive value for worsening outcomes as early as cutpoint 5, we recommend that pain management strategies use cutpoints informed by risk factors for worsening outcomes as cues for earlier intervention, thus delaying or preventing worst pain among women with metastatic disease who are at greatest risk."
CD008686,0,17582695,0,Are multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis autoimmune disorders of endogenous vasoactive neuropeptides?,"Autoimmune dysfunction of endogenous vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs) such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) has been postulated as a cause for some fatigue-related conditions. VN receptors are class II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which couple primarily to the adenylate cyclase (AC)-cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway and cAMP has a central role in neurological metabolism including influencing blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-spinal barrier (BSB) permeability, coordinating neuroregulatory pathways, and protecting against neuronal apoptosis. Complex clinical signs occur in multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While traditionally viewed as diseases of the motor system, the clinical picture of these conditions is considerably more complex. Disturbances of cognition and memory, as well as emotional lability occur along with fatigue and motor dysfunction. This paper explores the hypothesis that autoimmune dysfunction of VNs may contribute to MS and ALS. While MS and ALS differ in important respects, they have common pathogenic features including inflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Apoptotic mechanisms are associated with activation of caspase pathways and functional interplay between proinflammatory cytokines, interferon gamma and nitric oxide is suggested associated with oxidative stress and glial activation. Diseases such as MS and ALS may represent related conditions resulting from variation in expression of different receptor subtypes of the VN family. Anatomical differences of these receptors, perhaps in areas overly dependent on a specific VN receptor sub-type, may predispose to autoimmune susceptibility to these conditions, either in impaired expression of receptors or antibody and cellular immune targeting of them. Further studies are required to determine if such VN receptor sub-types of significant specificity exist and if they are susceptible to compromise. This hypothesis, if proven, may have implications for the development of treatment and preventive strategies."

Physical examination revealed her abdomen was distended and nontender. Her white blood cell count and serum markers for ovarian cancer were normal (alpha-fetoprotein level, 1.6 microg/L; Ca-125 level, 15 U/mL; beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin level < 2 IU/mL). She had no important medical history; in particular, she had no history of malignancy. She denied having any chest symptoms; in particular, she denied experiencing chest pain, cough, or dyspnea. She had stopped smoking at the age of 40 years after having smoked for a total of 20 pack-years. A computed tomographic (CT) examination of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. Helical CT was performed with 150 mL of intravenous contrast material (iohexol, Omnipaque; Amersham Healthcare, Cork, Ireland) and 750 mL of oral contrast material (diatrizoate sodium, Hypaque; Amersham Health, Princeton, NJ). CT sections were 5 mm thick and were acquired from the top of the diaphragm through the ischial tuberosities with a rotation time of 13.5 seconds per rotation and use of a LightSpeed 16 CT scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wis)."
CD008686,0,17579499,0,CNS complications of breast cancer: current and emerging treatment options.,"In general, the development of CNS metastases of breast cancer depends on several prognostic factors, including younger age and a negative hormone receptor status. Also, the presence of a breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1) germline mutation and expression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu) proto-oncogene seem to contribute to an increased rate of development of CNS metastases. The choice of appropriate therapy for brain metastases also depends on prognostic factors, including the age of the patient, the Karnofsky performance score, the number of brain metastases and the presence of systemic disease. Surgery followed by whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is generally restricted to ambulant patients with a single brain metastasis without active extracranial disease. In patients who have two to four metastases, stereotactic focal radiotherapy (i.e. radiosurgery) with or without WBRT is usually indicated. In the remainder of patients, WBRT alone provides adequate palliation. Although breast carcinoma is sensitive to chemotherapy, the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is still unclear. Objective responses after cyclophosphamide-based therapies were reported in studies performed in the 1980s. Subgroup analysis of data from a randomised study indicates that survival may improve if WBRT is combined with the radiosensitiser efaproxiral. Interestingly, the Her2/neu antibody trastuzumab, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, produces systemic responses and enhanced survival, without a clear effect on brain metastases. Breast cancer constitutes the most common solid primary tumour leading to leptomeningeal disease. Clinical symptoms such as cranial nerve dysfunction or a cauda equina syndrome can be treated with local radiotherapy. A randomised study in patients with leptomeningeal disease secondary to breast cancer has revealed that intrathecal chemotherapy is associated with substantially more adverse effects than non-intrathecal treatment, without a clear benefit in terms of response or survival. Intramedullary metastasis is rare but often presents with a rapidly progressive myelopathy. Local radiotherapy may preserve neurological function. Epidural spinal cord metastasis occurs in approximately 4% of patients and can lead to paraplegia. A randomised study has shown that surgical intervention together with local radiotherapy is superior to local radiotherapy alone."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed a sacral insufficiency fracture complicated by an epidural haematoma. Bleeding tendency in this case can be accounted for by platelet function defects, often described in plasma cell disorders in the absence of obvious coagulation abnormalities. Surgical intervention was contraindicated as a result of poor overall patient performance status (poor surgical candidate due to extensive myelomatous bone disease, previous vertebral compression fractures requiring orthopaedic stabilisation, and requiring opiate analgesia for bone pain) and management was conservative. Patients presenting with back pain and documented bone disease in the setting of myeloma should be managed with a high index of clinical suspicion and considered for urgent MR imaging to avoid missing this serious and potentially reversible complication. We report the undescribed causative association between sacral insufficiency fracture and lumbo-sacral epidural haematoma. We illustrate the MRI signal and contrast enhancement pattern of an acute presentation of epidural haematoma."

She was admitted to our clinic with the complaint of low-back pain and was later diagnosed to have a brown tumor. The patient underwent surgery and partial sacrectomy and iliac wing resection was performed in Orthopedic Surgery Department. Subsequently the patient underwent parathyroid adenoma excision in General Surgery Department. On her control examination at postoperative 3 months, she had no pain and was able to perform daily activities without any problem. We believe it is an interesting clinical case both because it shows a very rare localization of brown tumor and points out the importance of employing a wide clinical scope in the differential diagnosis of back pain."

A systematic review was performed on all available records on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL electronic databases. Studies were considered eligible if they investigated a cohort of low back pain patients, used an appropriate reference standard, and reported sufficient data on the diagnostic accuracy of tests. Two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data to calculate positive (LR+) and negative (LR-) likelihood ratios. Six studies evaluating 22 different clinical features and tests were identified. The prevalence of malignancy ranged from 0.1 to 3.5%. A previous history of cancer (LR+ = 23.7), elevated ESR (LR+ = 18.0), reduced hematocrit (LR+ = 18.2), and overall clinician judgement (LR+ = 12.1) increased the probability of malignancy when present. A combination of age > or =50 years, a previous history of cancer, unexplained weight loss, and failure to improve after 1 month had a reported sensitivity of 100%. Overall, there was poor reporting of methodological quality items, and very few studies were performed in community primary care settings. Malignancy is rare as a cause of low back pain. The most useful features and tests are a previous history of cancer, elevated ESR, reduced hematocrit, and clinician judgement."
CD008686,0,17564154,0,A study of oncology fellows' training in end-of-life care.,"Caring for the dying is a core competency for oncologists, yet the quality of oncology fellowship training in end-of-life (EOL) care has not been assessed. A convenience sample of physicians attending the 2004 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology responded to a 112-item questionnaire that assessed fellows' knowledge and education about EOL care. Of the 120 respondents, 107 (89%) rated caring for dying patients as""quite"" or ""very important. ""Forty-two percent of the fellows rated the overall quality of teaching EOL care in their fellowship as ""very good"" or ""excellent,"" whereas 23% gave such ratings to EOL teaching in fellowship (P < or = 0.001). Fellows viewed attending oncologists as having more expertise in dealing with acute complications of cancer (eg, managing spinal cord compression, 78%) than in delivering EOL care (eg, managing pain, 54%; P < 0.001). Fellows also were more likely to have received observation and feedback on bone marrow biopsies than on EOL discussions. Knowledge about key EOL care topics was poor; only 31% correctly performed an opioid conversion. Oncology fellows described deficiencies in training on EOL issues;they may benefit from improved education on EOL topics."

CD008686,0,17558456,0,Transclival cerebrospinal fluid fistula in a patient with Marfan's syndrome.,"Marfan's syndrome is a disease associated with reduced structural integrity of connective tissues. We report a 36-year-old patient with Marfan's syndrome who presented with rhinorrhoea, occipital headache and vomiting. Physical examination revealed typical Marfan's syndrome features including dolicocephalous, mandibular micrognathia, tall stature, disproportionately long limbs and digits, and hypermobility of the joints. A high-resolution CT scan demonstrated pneumoencephalous, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filling the sphenoidal sinus, and a small bone defect of the clivus. Surgery performed through a transsphenoidal approach revealed the sphenoid sinus to be filled with CSF and a small fenestration in the clivus. The arachnoid diverticulum and the fenestration were repaired and covered with a graft of abdominal fat. In this patient, a deficiency in bone development associated with Marfan's syndrome gave rise to a clival fenestration and a transclival CSF fistula. Although abnormalities of the spinal meningeal membranes have been reported in Marfan's syndrome, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a fistula located in the cranial base in this condition."

CD008686,0,17552138,0,Vertebroplasty in the treatment of vertebral metastases: clinical cases and review of the literature.,"Bone metastases are the most common tumours affecting the musculoskeletal system. The most frequently affected area of the skeleton is the spine. The vertebral bodies are reached largely via the bloodstream and neoplastic substitution of the bone tissue causes progressive structural destruction leading to loss of stability and compression of the intracanal nerve structures. The treatment of bone metastases in the spine is different and controversial, mostly because of the wide spectrum of clinical and radiographic pattern of the local and systemic disease. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is emerging as one of the most promising new interventional procedures for relieving (or reducing) pain and improve stability. In this article we review indications, contraindications, technique, and complications of percutaneous vertebroplasty in spine metastases."

CD008686,0,17550752,0,Fluoride-related bone disease associated with habitual tea consumption.,"Acquired osteosclerosis is a rare disorder of bone formation but an important consideration in adults with sclerotic bones or elevated bone density results. In such patients, malignancy, hepatitis C, and fluorosis should all be considered when making a diagnosis. We describe 4 patients evaluated at our Metabolic Bone Disease Clinic from May 1, 1997, to July 1, 2006, whose bone disorders resulted from chronic fluoride exposure due to excessive tea intake. Three of these patients had toxic serum fluoride levels (> 15 micromol/L). Although the clinical presentation of the patients varied, all 4 had an unexpectedly elevated spine bone mineral density that was proportionately higher than the bone mineral density at the hip. Other clinical features included gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and weight loss; lower extremity pain sometimes associated with stress fractures of the lower extremities; renal insufficiency; and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Readily available, tea often contains high levels of fluoride. Obsessive-compulsive drinking behaviors and renal insufficiency may predispose to excessive fluoride consumption and accumulation. The current cases show that fluoride-related bone disease is an important clinical consideration in patients with dense bones or gastrointestinal symptoms and a history of excessive tea consumption. Furthermore, fluoride excess should be considered in all patients with a history of excessive tea consumption, especially due to its insidious nature and nonspecific clinical presentation."

CD008686,0,17533093,0,Case studies in the diagnosis of upper extremity pain using magnetic resonance imaging.,"The diagnosis of upper extremity pain can be a daunting task for the examining physician. The differential diagnosis for pain at each level in the upper extremity is often extensive and diverse. Quite frequently, the clinical signs and symptoms of multiple pathologic conditions are overlapping and nonspecific. The decision to treat conservatively or with surgery often depends on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. MRI's ability to produce multiplanar images with excellent soft tissue contrast has made it an indispensable tool for diagnosis and treatment planning in patients with upper extremity pain. In most instances, MR imaging provides information that all other modalities cannot. This is all possible due to an incredible imaging device that creates magnificent images painlessly and with no known detrimental biological side effects. This article demonstrates only a small number of the possible causes of upper extremity pain that can be diagnosed with MR imaging. It is comforting to know that the vast majority of pathology causing pain in the upper extremity can be visualized with MRI scanning."

CD008686,0,17525348,0,Orofacial pain in cancer: part I--mechanisms.,"The mechanisms involved, and possible treatment targets, in orofacial pain due to cancer are poorly understood. The aim of the first of this two-part series is to review the involved pathophysiological mechanisms and explore their possible roles in the orofacial region. However, there is a lack of relevant research in the trigeminal region, and we have therefore applied data accumulated from experiments on cancer pain mechanisms in rodent spinal models. In the second part, we review the clinical presentation of cancer-associated orofacial pain at various stages: initial diagnosis, during therapy (chemo-, radiotherapy, surgery), and in the post-therapy period. In the present article, we provide a brief outline of trigeminal functional neuro-anatomy and pain-modulatory pathways. Tissue destruction by invasive tumors (or metastases) induces inflammation and nerve damage, with attendant acute pain. In some cases, chronic pain, involving inflammatory and neuropathic mechanisms, may ensue. Distant, painful effects of tumors include paraneoplastic neuropathic syndromes and effects secondary to the release of factors by the tumor (growth factors, cytokines, and enzymes). Additionally, pain is frequent in cancer management protocols (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy).

Physical examination revealed a palpable loin mass, fixed flexion deformity of the lumbar and cervical spines, with severely restricted cervical movement and mouth opening. An ultrasound and computed tomography scan confirmed a 7-cm solid mass in the left kidney. Following a multidisciplinary meeting he elected to undergo radical laparoscopic nephrectomy. An anesthetic opinion was sought in view of the expected difficulties with intubation. Mouth opening was restricted to 3 fingers and he was Mallampati grade 3 on airway examination. As the degree of spinal flexion deformity and restricted spinal movement was significant, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position, and surgery was performed using a transperitoneal approach. A five-port technique was employed and was carried out successfully with no complication. Operative time was 240 minutes and estimated blood loss was 700 mL. His postoperative inpatient stay was 4.5 days. Surgical margins were clear and the patient was disease-free at 2-year follow-up.

CD008686,0,17478048,0,P2X7-related modulation of pathological nociception in rats.,"Growing evidence supports a role for the immune system in the induction and maintenance of chronic pain. ATP is a key neurotransmitter in this process. Recent studies demonstrate that the glial ATP receptor, P2X7, contributes to the modulation of pathological pain. To further delineate the endogenous mechanisms that are involved in P2X7-related antinociception, we utilized a selective P2X7 receptor antagonist, A-438079, in a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments. Injection of A-438079 (10-300 micromol/kg, i.p.) was anti-allodynic in three different rat models of neuropathic pain and it attenuated formalin-induced nocifensive behaviors. Using in vivo electrophysiology, A-438079 (80 micromol/kg, i.v.) reduced noxious and innocuous evoked activity of different classes of spinal neurons (low threshold, nociceptive specific, wide dynamic range) in neuropathic rats. The effects of A-438079 on evoked firing were diminished or absent in sham rats. Spontaneous activity of all classes of spinal neurons was also significantly reduced by A-438079 in neuropathic but not sham rats. In vitro, A-438079 (1 microM) blocked agonist-induced (2,3-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP, 30 microM) current in non-neuronal cells taken from the vicinity of the dorsal root ganglia. Furthermore, A-438079 dose-dependently (0.3-3 microM) decreased the quantity of the cytokine, interleukin-1beta, released from peripheral macrophages. Thus, ATP, acting through the P2X7 receptor, exerts a wide-ranging influence on spinal neuronal activity following a chronic injury. Antagonism of the P2X7 receptor can in turn modulate central sensitization and produce antinociception in animal models of pathological pain. These effects are likely mediated through immuno-neural interactions that affect the release of endogenous cytokines."
CD008686,0,17477101,0,Evaluation and treatment of acute low back pain.,"Acute low back pain with or without sciatica usually is self-limited and has no serious underlying pathology. For most patients, reassurance, pain medications, and advice to stay active are sufficient. A more thorough evaluation is required in selected patients with ""red flag"" findings associated with an increased risk of cauda equina syndrome, cancer, infection, or fracture. These patients also require closer follow-up and, in some cases, urgent referral to a surgeon. In patients with nonspecific mechanical low back pain, imaging can be delayed for at least four to six weeks, which usually allows the pain to improve. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, heat therapy, physical therapy, and advice to stay active. Spinal manipulative therapy may provide short-term benefits compared with sham therapy but not when compared with conventional treatments.

CD008686,0,17467892,0,Pathogenetic role of myelitis for syringomyelia.,"CSF-flow obstruction is regarded as a mandatory factor for the development of syringomyelia. However, there are conditions in which syringomyelia is not associated with evident persistent CSF-flow obstruction, as in the case of inflammatory spinal cord lesions. In these instances we hypothesize that the accumulation of vasogenic edema may play a role in the development of the syrinx. Recently proposed theories underline, even in the event of CSF-flow obstructions, a major role for the accumulation and final coalescence of interstitial spinal fluid, rather than CSF penetration through the spinal cord."
CD008686,0,17464087,0,Complete spinal cord injury treatment using autologous bone marrow cell transplantation and bone marrow stimulation with granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor: Phase I/II clinical trial.,"To assess the safety and therapeutic efficacy of autologous human bone marrow cell (BMC) transplantation and the administration of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a phase I/II open-label and nonrandomized study was conducted on 35 complete spinal cord injury patients. The BMCs were transplanted by injection into the surrounding area of the spinal cord injury site within 14 injury days (n = 17), between 14 days and 8 weeks (n = 6), and at more than 8 weeks (n = 12) after injury. In the control group, all patients (n = 13) were treated only with conventional decompression and fusion surgery without BMC transplantation. The patients underwent preoperative and follow-up neurological assessment using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), electrophysiological monitoring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The mean follow-up period was 10.4 months after injury. At 4 months, the MRI analysis showed the enlargement of spinal cords and the small enhancement of the cell implantation sites, which were not any adverse lesions such as malignant transformation, hemorrhage, new cysts, or infections. Furthermore, the BMC transplantation and GM-CSF administration were not associated with any serious adverse clinical events increasing morbidities. The AIS grade increased in 30.4% of the acute and subacute treated patients (AIS A to B or C), whereas no significant improvement was observed in the chronic treatment group. Increasing neuropathic pain during the treatment and tumor formation at the site of transplantation are still remaining to be investigated. Long-term and large scale multicenter clinical study is required to determine its precise therapeutic effect. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article."

CD008686,0,17439592,0,"Non-traumatic vertebral fractures in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer: a previously unreported, unrecognized problem.","Recent studies suggest cancer therapy may compromise bone integrity. What is the rate of vertebral fractures among patients who have received trimodality therapy (radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery) for locally advanced esophageal cancer? This single-institution, retrospective study attempted to answer this question, focusing on 337 patients who had received trimodality therapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer between 1996 and 2005. Reports of serial radiographs were reviewed to identify vertebral fractures. Duration of follow-up was gathered for all esophageal cancer patients with the intention of calculating fracture incidence rates. Fracture-related symptoms, types of intervention and fracture recurrence were also gleaned from the clinical records. First-time fractures were identified in 47 patients, and 45 of these were new since the cancer diagnosis. Thus, the first-time fracture incidence rate from the time of cancer diagnosis was 12 fractures per 100 patient years. The median time from cancer diagnosis to fracture was 9 months. Fifteen (33%) patients were symptomatic. Acknowledging that a retrospective study can inadvertently result in information omission, we report that pain medications were started in only seven patients (16%), and osteoporosis medication in only six (13%). Two patients were hospitalized, and two underwent vertebroplasty. The median survival after fracture diagnosis was 36 months. This report describes a seemingly high fracture incidence rate that requires confirmation. If confirmed, future studies should focus on identifying risk factors and optimal strategies for the prevention and treatment of vertebral fractures in patients with esophageal cancer."

CD008686,0,17427644,0,A case of pulmonary vein tumor presenting as a left atrial mass.,"Primary cardiac tumors are extremely rare and can originate within the heart or be the result of tumor spread from other sites. We report a female patient with a pulmonary vein tumor extending into the left atrium that had a suspicious primary malignant origin with a sacral metastatic carcinoma. The patient was admitted complaining of pain in her buttock area as a result of a sacral tumor. It was believed that the sacral tumor was a metastasis from the imaging study and clinical manifestation. The primary malignant origin was evaluated. The chest CT showed a left atrium thrombus-like lesion without a pulmonary abnormality. After a transesophageal echocardiogram, the patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary vein tumor extending to the left atrium. The patient was given palliative radiotherapy for the sacral pain. Initially, the clinical impression was a metastatic sacral tumor with a thromboembolism of the left atrium. However, this patient was finally diagnosed with a pulmonary vein tumor with a left atrium extension by a transesophageal echocardiogram."
CD008686,0,17424785,0,[Treatment of osteoporotic fractures of the spine].,"Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease characterized by reduced bone strength due to the loss of bone mass, structural disproportion and reduced calcium level as well as changes in the bone structure caused by trabecular deficit. The loss of bone mass in the vertebrae leads to an increased risk of fractures. Osteoporotic vertebral fractures are two to three times more frequent than hip fractures, especially in women. Osteoporotic compressive fractures of the spine mostly occur in the middle and lower thoracic spine and in the thoracolumbar spine. Common consequences of fractures include long-term pains, decrease in the height and spinal deformity, which significantly correlate with disorders in the gait and mobility, reduced pulmonary function, loss of appetite and in the end increased mortality. Clinical picture in acute conditions manifests itself as a sudden pain in the back following minimal trauma but also often without any trauma at all. Diagnostics is based on a detailed medical history and a thorough clinical examination. Radiological diagnosis relies on standard x-rays. In case of clinical indication (differential diagnosis of tumor or spondylitis, neurological weakness) CT and/or MR imaging is performed. The approach to the treatment of osteoporotic fractures of the spine is individual and is based upon the medical history, localization of symptoms and correlation of the clinical examination with the radiological finding. Open reduction, decompression and fixation are indicated in patients with posttraumatic stenosis and neurological weakness. Current operative methods include vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, which significantly reduce pain and improve mobility of the patient and consequently, the quality of life."

CD008686,0,17409792,0,Neurosurgical management of intramedullary spinal cord tumors in children.,"The majority of intramedullary spinal cord tumors in children are low-grade glial tumors. They become symptomatic with pain, neurologic deficits or spinal deformity. The diagnosis is most readily obtained using magnetic resonance imaging. The natural history is significant for slow progression of symptoms. Surgery is the best treatment and is also indicated to confirm the histological diagnosis. In case of a low-grade tumor or a vascular lesion such as hemangioblastoma or cavernoma, a total or near-total resection is attempted. For astrocytomas the resection almost always remains biologically incomplete, but a near-total resection is still associated with a long progression-free survival. Neurologic morbidity is relatively low during long-term follow-up but can be up to 30% for transient motor deficits. The risk for neurologic deterioration is higher for patients with pronounced dysfunction preoperatively. This is an important argument for early surgical resection. Surgery is performed using the spectrum of microsurgical techniques as well as advanced technology, e.g. lasers and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring with motor evoked potentials. High-grade tumors are resected conservatively and treated with radiation and chemotherapy. The prognosis of high-grade glial tumors remains poor."
CD008686,0,17406908,0,Surgical treatment strategies and outcome in patients with breast cancer metastatic to the spine: a review of 87 patients.,"Aggressive surgical management of spinal metastatic disease can provide improvement of neurological function and significant pain relief. However, there is limited literature analyzing such management as is pertains to individual histopathology of the primary tumor, which may be linked to overall prognosis for the patient. In this study, clinical outcomes were reviewed for patients undergoing spinal surgery for metastatic breast cancer. Respective review was done to identify all patients with breast cancer over an eight-year period at a major cancer center and then to select those with symptomatic spinal metastatic disease who underwent spinal surgery. Pre- and postoperative pain levels (visual analog scale [VAS]), analgesic medication usage, and modified Frankel grade scores were compared on all patients who underwent surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess risks for complications. A total of 16,977 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer, and 479 patients (2.8%) were diagnosed with spinal metastases from breast cancer. Of these patients, 87 patients (18%) underwent 125 spinal surgeries. Of the 76 patients (87%) who were ambulatory preoperatively, the majority (98%) were still ambulatory. Of the 11 patients (13%) who were nonambulatory preoperatively, four patients were alive at 3 months postoperatively, three of which (75%) regained ambulation. The preoperative median VAS of six was significantly reduced to a median score of two at the time of discharge and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively (P < 0.001 for all time points). A total of 39% of patients experienced complications; 87% were early (within 30 days of surgery), and 13% were late. Early major surgical complications were significantly greater when five or more levels were instrumented. In patients with spinal metastases specifically from breast cancer, aggressive surgical management provides significant pain relief and preservation or improvement of neurological function with an acceptably low rate of complications."
CD008686,0,17405452,0,Genetic susceptibility and development of chronic non-malignant back pain.,"Previous data indicate that persistent pain states often involve sensitization within the central nervous system (CNS). Many recently described human genetic variants may affect these central processes. Genetic variability influences both synthesis and function of proteins affecting the plasticity of the CNS. Hence, individual genetic variability may be important to understand the development of many persistent pain conditions including chronic nonmalignant back pain. In this review we argue that genotyping of each patient may be a valuable complement to diagnosis of back disorders. This may be important for future prescription of medicine to individuals predisposed for persistent pain. Increased understanding of genetic variability may also improve multidisciplinary and cognitive-behavioral approaches to management of persistent pain. Translation of this information from the laboratory into clinical application will be important for future prevention as well as treatment of long-lasting non-malignant pain conditions."

CD008686,0,17388989,0,Hepatocellular carcinoma presenting as nervous system involvement.,"To analyze the clinical features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with signs and symptoms of nervous system involvement as the initial presentation. Over a period of 11 years (January 1993 to December 2003), 15,008 HCC patients were identified at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Amongst them, 42 cases had nervous system involvement, of which six had nervous system involvement as their initial presentation. These six cases were enrolled in this study and their clinical and laboratory data were analyzed. The clinical features of the other 36 HCC cases with nervous system involvement were also analyzed for comparison. The six cases were all males, aged 36-68 years old. The involved parts of the nervous system were the cerebellar hemisphere (one), the frontal lobe (one), the sphenoid sinus, sellar turcica, and cavernous sinus (one), the cervical spine (one), and the thoracic spine (two). Their corresponding neurologic presentations were back pain, headache, consciousness disturbance, visual disturbance, and limb weakness. Whilst three out of six patients presenting with nervous system manifestations were found to have concurrent systemic metastases in other expected sites (lung, bone), three had isolated nervous system involvement even after extensive work up. The associated medical conditions of the six cases included hepatitis B (three), hepatitis C (one), liver cirrhosis (two), portal vein thrombosis (three), and diabetes mellitus (two). All the six died within 9 months after the detection of nervous system involvement. The prevalence of nervous system involvement in HCC patients is 0.28% (42/15,088), with 0.04% (6/15,088) having this as their initial presentation. The prognosis of HCC with nervous system involvement is grave. Their clinical and laboratory data are not unique but the diagnosis could only be confirmed by hepatic and nervous system imaging studies, histopathologic examination, and serum alpha-fetoprotein detection. This consideration should be emphasized especially in areas that are hyperendemic for HCC and if the original focus of metastatic lesion is obscure."

CD008686,0,17365137,0,"Final report on the safety assessment of capsicum annuum extract, capsicum annuum fruit extract, capsicum annuum resin, capsicum annuum fruit powder, capsicum frutescens fruit, capsicum frutescens fruit extract, capsicum frutescens resin, and capsaicin.","Capsicum-derived ingredients function as skin-conditioning agents--miscellaneous, external analgesics, flavoring agents, or fragrance components in cosmetics. These ingredients are used in 19 cosmetic products at concentrations as high as 5%. Cosmetic-grade material may be extracted using hexane, ethanol, or vegetable oil and contain the full range of phytocompounds that are found in the Capsicum annuum or Capsicum frutescens plant (aka red chiles), including Capsaicin. Aflatoxin and N-nitroso compounds (N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine) have been detected as contaminants. The ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrum for Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract indicates a small peak at approximately 275 nm, and a gradual increase in absorbance, beginning at approximately 400 nm. Capsicum and paprika are generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food. Hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts of Capsicum Frutescens Fruit at 200 mg/kg resulted in death of all mice. In a short-term inhalation toxicity study using rats, no difference was found between vehicle control and a 7% Capsicum Oleoresin solution. In a 4-week feeding study, red chilli (Capsicum annuum) in the diet at concentrations up to 10% was relatively nontoxic in groups of male mice. In an 8-week feeding study using rats, intestinal exfoliation, cytoplasmic fatty vacuolation and centrilobular necrosis of hepatocytes, and aggregation of lymphocytes in the portal areas were seen at 10% Capsicum Frutescens Fruit, but not 2%. Rats fed 0.5 g/kg day-1 crude Capsicum Fruit Extract for 60 days exhibited no significant gross pathology at necropsy, but slight hyperemia of the liver and reddening of the gastric mucosa were observed. Weanling rats fed basal diets supplemented with whole red pepper at concentrations up to 5.0% for up to 8 weeks had no pathology of the large intestines, livers, and kidneys, but destruction of the taste buds and keratinization and erosion of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract were noted in groups fed 0.5% to 5.0% red pepper. The results of 9-and 12-month extension of this study showed normal large intestines and kidneys. In rabbits fed Capsicum Annuum Powder at 5 mg/kg day-1 in the diet daily for 12 months damage to the liver and spleen was noted. A rabbit skin irritation test of Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract at concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 1.0% produced no irritation, but Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract induced concentration-dependent (at 25 to 500 microg/ml) cytotoxicity in a human buccal mucosa fibroblast cell line. An ethanol extract of red chili was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, but not in TA100, or in Escherichia coli. Other genotoxicity assays gave a similar pattern of mixed results. Adenocarcinoma of the abdomen was observed in 7/20 mice fed 100 mg red chilies per day for 12 months; no tumors were seen in control animals. Neoplastic changes in the liver and intestinal tumors were observed in rats fed red chili powder at 80 mg/kg day-1 for 30 days, intestinal and colon tumors were seen in rats fed red chili powder and 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine, but no tumors were observed in controls. In another study in rats, however, red chile pepper in the diet at the same dose decreased the number of tumors seen with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. Other feeding studies evaluated the effect of red chili peppers on the incidence of stomach tumors produced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, finding that red pepper had a promoting effect. Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract promoted the carcinogenic effect of methyl(acetoxymethyl)nitrosamine (carcinogen) or benzene hexachloride (hepatocarcinogen) in inbred male and female Balb/c mice dosed orally (tongue application). Clinical findings include symptoms of cough, sneezing, and runny nose in chili factory workers. Human respiratory responses to Capsicum Oleoresin spray include burning of the throat, wheezing, dry cough, shortness of breath, gagging, gasping, inability to breathe or speak, and, rarely, cyanosis, apnea, and respiratory arrest. A trade name mixture containing 1% to 5% Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract induced very slight erythema in 1 of 10 volunteers patch tested for 48 h. Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract at 0.025% in a repeated-insult patch test using 103 subjects resulted in no clinically meaningful irritation or allergic contact dermatitis. One epidemiological study indicated that chili pepper consumption may be a strong risk factor for gastric cancer in populations with high intakes of chili pepper; however, other studies did not find this association. Capsaicin functions as an external analgesic, a fragrance ingredient, and as a skin-conditioning agent--miscellaneous in cosmetic products, but is not in current use. Capsaicin is not generally recognized as safe and effective by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fever blister and cold sore treatment, but is considered to be safe and effective as an external analgesic counterirritant. Ingested Capsaicin is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine in animal studies. Subcutaneous injection of Capsaicin in rats resulted in a rise in the blood concentration, reaching a maximum at 5 h; the highest tissue concentrations were in the kidney and lowest in the liver. In vitro percutaneous absorption of Capsaicin has been demonstrated in human, rat, mouse, rabbit, and pig skin. Enhancement of the skin permeation of naproxen (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent) in the presence of Capsaicin has also been demonstrated. Pharmacological and physiological studies demonstrated that Capsaicin, which contains a vanillyl moiety, produces its sensory effects by activating a Ca2 +-permeable ion channel on sensory neurons. Capsaicin is a known activator of vanilloid receptor 1. Capsaicin-induced stimulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis has been shown using bull seminal vesicles and rheumatoid arthritis synoviocytes. Capsaicin inhibits protein synthesis in Vero kidney cells and human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells in vitro, and inhibits growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas solanacearum, and Bacillus subtilis bacterial cultures, but not Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Oral LD50 values as low as 161.2 mg/kg (rats) and 118.8 mg/kg (mice) have been reported for Capsaicin in acute oral toxicity studies, with hemorrhage of the gastric fundus observed in some of the animals that died. Intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous LD50 values were lower. In subchronic oral toxicity studies using mice, Capsaicin produced statistically significant differences in the growth rate and liver/body weight increases. Capsaicin is an ocular irritant in mice, rats, and rabbits. Dose-related edema was observed in animals receiving Capsaicin injections into the hindpaw (rats) or application to the ear (mice). In guinea pigs, dinitrochlorobenzene contact dermatitis was enhanced in the presence of Capsaicin, injected subcutaneously, whereas dermal application inhibited sensitization in mice. Immune system effects have been observed in neonatal rats injected subcutaneously with Capsaicin. Capsaicin produced mixed results in S. typhimurium micronucleus and sister-chromatid exchange genotoxicity assays. Positive results for Capsaicin were reported in DNA damage assays. Carcinogenic, cocarcinogenic, anticarcinogenic, antitumorigenic, tumor promotion, and anti-tumor promotion effects of Capsaicin have been reported in animal studies. Except for a significant reduction in crown-rump length in day 18 rats injected subcutaneously with Capsaicin (50 mg/kg) on gestation days 14, 16, 18, or 20, no reproductive or developmental toxicity was noted. In pregnant mice dosed subcutaneously with Capsaicin, depletion of substance P in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves of pregnant females and fetuses was noted. In clinical tests, nerve degeneration of intracutaneous nerve fibers and a decrease in pain sensation induced by heat and mechanical stimuli were evident in subjects injected intradermally with Capsaicin. An increase in mean inspiratory flow was reported for eight normal subjects who inhaled nebulized 10(-7) M Capsaicin. The results of provocative and predictive tests involving human subjects indicated that Capsaicin is a skin irritant. Overall, studies suggested that these ingredients can be irritating at low concentrations. Although the genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and tumor promotion potential of Capsaicin have been demonstrated, so have opposite effects. Skin irritation and other tumor-promoting effects of Capsaicin appear to be mediated through interaction with the same vanilloid receptor. Given this mechanism of action and the observation that many tumor promoters are irritating to the skin, the Panel considered it likely that a potent tumor promoter may also be a moderate to severe skin irritant. Thus, a limitation on Capsaicin content that would significantly reduce its skin irritation potential is expected to, in effect, lessen any concerns relating to tumor promotion potential. Because Capsaicin enhanced the penetration of an anti-inflammatory agent through human skin, the Panel recommends that care should be exercised in using ingredients that contain Capsaicin in cosmetic products. The Panel advised industry that the total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)/pesticide contamination should be limited to not more than 40 ppm, with not more than 10 ppm for any specific residue, and agreed on the following limitations for other impurities: arsenic (3 mg/kg max), heavy metals (0.002% max), and lead (5 mg/kg max). Industry was also advised that aflatoxin should not be present in these ingredients (the Panel adopted < or =15 ppb as corresponding to ""negative"" aflatoxin content), and that ingredients derived from Capsicum annuum and Capsicum Frutescens Plant species should not be used in products where N-nitroso compounds may be formed.

Technical note.,"Elderly patients in poor general health frequently suffer vertebral body (VB) fractures due to osteoporosis or vertebral metastatic lesions. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty have become the standard treatment for these types of fractures. In certain conditions that cause local kyphosis, such as spinal cord compression due to a metastatic epidural tumor or the shortening of the spinal canal secondary to vertebral compression, the surgical treatment should provide decompression and stabilization during a short intervention. In this study the authors evaluated a surgical technique that frequently combines a same-session surgical decompression, such as a laminectomy, and posterior instrumentation-assisted stabilization during the same open intervention in which the VB is stabilized by kyphoplasty."

The initial diagnosis of brown tumor was delayed, but later pain in her leg worsened and a sacral lesion was incidentally discovered on lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); multiple destructive bone lesions were then found radiologically. The radiological features of the multiple bone lesions, which mimicked multiple metastatic tumors, seemed to be those of the terminal stage of malignancy. However, pathological examination and abnormal laboratory data showing elevated serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone and low serum phosphate confirmed the diagnosis of brown tumor. Adenoma in the parathyroid gland was confirmed and surgically resected.

Neurologic examination revealed mild occipital neuralgia, difficulty with movements of the cranium, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, but no Babinski sign. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine showed a 1x2 cm well-circumscribed extradural mass, with lytic destruction and fracture of the lateral mass of C1. Preoperatively dynamic cervical radiographs showed no instability. Using a transcondylar approach, the tumor was removed, and posterolateral fixation and fusion (using iliac autograft) was performed. Biopsy was reported as plasmacytoma. The patient was pain-free with bony fusion 3 years after surgery. This paper presents a pathologic fracture of C1.

CD008686,0,17344085,0,Radiculopathy as a manifestation of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis.,"Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare condition of children and young adults in which Langerhans' cells proliferate. The clinical spectrum ranges from solitary or few focal lesions to multisystem involvement mimicking vasculitis or hematological malignancy. Focal bone lesions, known as eosinophilic granulomas, are the most common manifestations. Eosinophilic granuloma usually presents with a variable combination of pain, swelling, fracture, and fever. Facial bone involvement may manifest as an ear discharge, hearing loss, or exophthalmos. Nerve root pain is rarely reported, even in patients with lesions in the axial skeleton. We report four cases of nerve root pain caused by LCH. Two male patients aged 25 and 34 years, respectively, presented with truncated femoral neuralgia related to acetabular granulomas. A 25-year-old woman with involvement of the L5 vertebral body and a 41-year-old man with a sacral lesion presented with sciatica."
CD008686,0,17341047,0,Spinal cord stimulation: indications and outcomes.,"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is the most commonly used implantable neurostimulation modality for management of pain syndromes. In this paper the authors describe the current indications for SCS and its efficacy in the treatment of those diseases. Specifically, the literature on patient selection and outcomes after SCS for failed-back surgery syndrome (FBSS), refractory angina pectoris, peripheral vascular disease, and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) Type I was reviewed. Effective pain relief was obtained in 60 to 80% of patients with FBSS and CRPS Type I. Furthermore, these patients had significant improvements in quality of life (QOL) and a significantly greater chance of returning to work than patients who did not undergo SCS. The use of SCS in patients with inoperable angina (that is, refractory angina pectoris) resulted in significant decreases in chest pain and hospital admissions as well as increased exercise duration, with less morbidity than with open procedures that were performed for pain control only. Patients with inoperable PVD also demonstrated significant improvements in pain relief, QOL, and limb mobility. Reported complications were mostly related to hardware and were relatively minor. Review of randomized controlled studies supports the use of SCS as an effective treatment modality for pain associated with FBSS, refractory angina pectoris, peripheral vascular disease, and CRPS Type I."
CD008686,0,17336528,0,Management of cervicomedullary compression in patients with congenital and acquired osseous-ligamentous pathologies.,"We present our experience in the diagnosis, surgical management and long-term follow-up of congenital and acquired osseous-ligamentous abnormalities or pathologies of the craniovertebral junction. The purpose of this study was: (i) to determine the incidence and degree of cervicomedullary compression in pediatric and young adult patients with congenital and acquired abnormalities, and (ii) to correlate cervicomedullary compression with other imaging and clinical factors to determine to what extend cervicomedullary compression is successfully treated with a posterior decompressive procedure, transoral decompression, and medical management. Between January 1995 and December 2004, 26 cases were managed in our department. These patients had: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (3); traumatic injury (2); congenital basilar impression (5, in 2 cases a posteriorly oriented or retroflexed odontoid); infection (10); craniovertebral junction Pott's disease (9); os odonteideum (3); condylus tertius (1); and tumor (2). Six of the patients (23.1%) had syringomyelia. Only three (11.3%) were in the pediatric age group. Symptoms and signs included headache (72%), ataxia (38%), lower cranial nerve dysfunction (54%), quadriparesis (44%), hyperreflexia (76%), Hoffman positivity (72%), achilles clonus (72%) nystagmus (33%) and dysphagia (22%). The mean follow-up time was 44 months (range 3-85). Twelve (46.2%) had undergone posterior fossa decompression; seven (26.6%) had ventral decompression. Seven of the patients (26.6%) had medical management. The major morbidity included pharyngeal wound sepsis leading to dehiscence (3.8%), valopharyngeal insufficiency (3.8%), cerebrospinal fluid leakage (3.8%), postoperative macroglossia (3.8%) and inadequate anterior decompression (3.8%). Transient neurological deterioration occurred in two patients (7.6%). Our management paradigm will result in some neurologic improvements and limit the progression of symptoms. Patients with these pathologies are likely to show a good neurologic outcome when treatment, whether with or without surgery, is administered early in the course of the disease."

The epidural catheter was removed on the ward after 24 hours. However, 72 hours after the intervention, the patient developed lower limb weakness and associated paresthesia mainly on the right side. Examination disclosed flaccid paralysis from the second lumbar vertebra affecting mainly the right lower extremity with no involvement of the sphincters. Emergency magnetic resonance imaging was negative for masses occupying the spinal canal. After a battery of tests over the following days (electromyography, lumbar puncture, and magnetic resonance imaging), bilateral polyradiculitis related to epidural analgesia was diagnosed.

CD008686,0,17287967,0,[Surgical management of vertebral column metastatic disease].,"The spine is the most frequent site of skeletal metastases. Among all spinal malignancies metastatic disease is most frequent and indicative of disseminating tumor disease. Depending on primary tumor entity, estimated survival time, general health status of the patient, presence of spinal instability and neurological deficits an oncological useful and patient-specific therapeutic intervention should be performed. New anterior approaches, resections and reconstruction techniques are making surgery a preferred method over radiation therapy. For differential indication of the multiple surgical treatment modalities prognostic scores are available to assist individual decision making. Indications for surgery include survival prognosis of minimum 3 months, intractable pain, progress of myelon compression and/or neurological deficits under radiochemotherapy, spinal instability and necessity for histological diagnosis. Resulting quality of life depends on efficient decompression of the spinal cord and restoration of spinal stability. To achieve these ultimate goals there are different anterior and posterior approaches, instrumentations and vertebral body replacement implants available. Preoperative embolization should be performed in hypervascular tumors, e.g., renal cell cancer. Vertebro-/Kyphoplasty as a percutaneous intervention should be considered for painful multisegmental disease and symptomatic osteolysis without epidural tumor compression to reach analgesia and stability. A multidisciplinary approach in patient selection, decision making and management is an essential precondition for complication avoidance and acceptable quality of life."

CD008686,0,17237903,0,Prevalence of acquired cystic disease in black Africans on hemodialysis in West Africa.,"Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) is a late manifestation of end-stage renal disease. To determine the prevalence of ACKD in black African patients on chronic hemodialysis in West Africa, we examined by ultrasonography the native kidneys of 83 patients from February to August 2002. ACKD was present in 26 patients, with estimated prevalence of 31% that was higher in males. There were 20 (77%) ACKD patients with a duration on dialysis of more than five years. The associated clinical manifestations were lumbar pain (58%), hematuria (23%) and urinary tract infection (23%). No case of renal cancer was detected during this study. We conclude that the prevalence of ACKD and its complications in black African patients on chronic hemodialysis in West Africa is high.

The mean age of the patients at the time of the surgery was 32 years (range 25-38 years). All patients suffered from lower-extremity pain and the results of the straight leg-raising test were positive in all cases. Three patients reported motor weakness and four had sensory disturbance-symptoms similar to those found in patients with lumbar disc herniation. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated spherically shaped extradural lesions of various sizes with low and high signal intensities on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. Discography revealed obvious communication between the cyst and the intervertebral disc with reproducible leg pain in all patients. All patients underwent posterior decompression and excision of the cysts either with or without additional discectomy. The radicular symptoms were remarkably improved in all patients immediately after surgery, and no recurrent lesions were noted during follow up."

Some studies suggest an ongoing inflammation in the spinal cord in these patients. From this perspective, intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) could be a therapeutic option. We performed a double-blinded randomized controlled pilot study with 20 patients to investigate the possible clinical effects of IvIg in PPS. Twenty patients were randomized to either IvIg 2 g/kg body weight or placebo. Primary endpoints were changes in pain, fatigue and muscle strength 3 months after treatment. Surrogate endpoints were changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine levels. Secondary endpoints were pain, fatigue and isometric muscle strength after 6 months. Patients receiving IvIg reported a significant improvement in pain during the first 3 months, but no change was noted for subjective fatigue and muscle strength. CSF levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were increased compared with patients with non-inflammatory neurological disorders. In conclusion, in this small pilot study no effect was seen with IvIg treatment on muscle strength and fatigue, however IvIg treated PPS patients reported significantly less pain 3 months after treatment. TNF-alpha was increased in the CSF from PPS patients. The results are promising, but not conclusive because of the low number of patients studied."
CD008686,0,17222113,0,Saddle sensation is preserved in a few patients with cauda equina or conus medullaris lesions.,"Although saddle sensory deficit seems the most useful clinical sign in the diagnosis of a cauda equina or conus medullaris lesion, findings of previous studies were controversial. The aim of the present study was to try to resolve this issue. The data from the author's series of patients with clinical, electrodiagnostic and radiological findings compatible with a cauda equina lesion were reviewed. Of the 117 patients in the series, 11 (10 men) did not have a saddle sensory deficit. These 11 patients had less severe sacral dysfunction than the others, and none of them needed urgent surgical intervention. They all had electromyographic (EMG) signs of a significant motor fibre lesion, and in seven men the sacral (penilo-cavernosus) reflex was clinically abnormal. The study revealed normal saddle sensation in approximately 10% of patients with cauda equina or conus medullaris lesions. Dissociation between preserved touch sensation and abnormal EMG findings, as well as dissociation between preserved touch sensation and a non-elicitable penilo-cavernosus reflex might be explained by preservation of the thinner sensory nerve fibres, which are more resistant to compression. Although, saddle sensory loss seems to identify patients who might benefit from urgent spinal imaging and surgery, further diagnostic evaluation is also indicated in patients with normal saddle sensation, particularly due to the increased frequency of spinal tumours found in this subgroup."

The two patients had contrast enhanced MRI, which was negative for vestibular schwannomas. Both underwent surgical excision of symptomatic lesions. Histopathology confirmed these lesions as schwannomas. Molecular genetic analysis in case 1 demonstrated two distinct mutations of the NF2 gene in two different schwannomas, with concomitant loss of heterozygosity in both tumours. In contrast peripheral blood lymphocytes did not reveal mutations of NF2. The authors recommend surgery for symptomatic lesions. Asymptomatic tumours can be monitored. Regular follow up is essential as they may develop fresh lesions at any time. The relevant literature is discussed."
CD008686,0,17207742,0,Subarachnoid transplant of a human neuronal cell line attenuates chronic allodynia and hyperalgesia after excitotoxic spinal cord injury in the rat.,"The relief of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) remains daunting, because pharmacologic intervention works incompletely and is accompanied by multiple side effects. Transplantation of human cells that make specific biologic agents that can potentially modulate the sensory responses that are painful would be very useful to treat problems such as pain. To address this need for clinically useful human cells, the human neuronal NT2 cell line was used as a source to isolate a unique human neuronal cell line that synthesizes and secretes/releases the inhibitory neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine. This new cell line, hNT2.17, expresses an exclusively neuronal phenotype, does not incorporate bromodeoxyuridine during differentiation, and does not express the tumor-related proteins fibroblast growth factor 4 and transforming growth factor-alpha during differentiation after 2 weeks of treatment with retinoic acid and mitotic inhibitors. The transplant of predifferentiated hNT2.17 cells was used in the excitotoxic SCI pain model, after intraspinal injection of the mixed AMPA/metabotropic receptor agonist quisqualic acid (QUIS). When hNT2.17 cells were transplanted into the lumbar subarachnoid space, tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by the injury were quickly and potently reversed. Control cell transplants of nonviable hNT2.17 cells had no effect on the hypersensitivity induced by QUIS. The effects of hNT2.17 cell grafts appeared 1 week after transplants and did not diminish during the 8-week course of the experiment when grafts were placed 2 weeks after SCI. Immunohistochemistry and quantification of the human grafts were used to ensure that many grafted cells were still present and synthesizing GABA at the end of the study. These data suggest that the human neuronal hNT2.17 cells can be used as a ""biologic minipump"" for antinociception in models of SCI and neuropathic pain."

CD008686,0,17205349,0,Sacral chordoma: a diagnosis not to be sat on?,"Sacral chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumours that are amenable to surgery, but unfortunately often diagnosed late. The aim of the study was to identify presenting symptoms, which may aid diagnosis and reduce the treatment time. Forty-four patients were identified with sacral chordoma between 1989 and 2006. Clinical and pathological records were reviewed retrospectively to elicit the symptoms recorded prior to diagnosis, duration of symptoms, surgical treatment, size of tumour and survival. Eleven patients were excluded, leaving 33 patients in the study group. Thirty-one patients had chordomas arising from the sacrum and two patients from the coccyx. The mean duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 120 weeks (2.3 years), with a median of length of 104 weeks (two years) and range of 26 to 416 weeks (0.5 to eight years). The mean maximum tumour size at resection was 8.3 cm, with a mean volume of 614 cm(3) (range 9-2,113 cm(3)). Pain, typically dull and worse with sitting, was the most common presenting symptom in 85% of patients. The classic symptoms of cauda equina (saddle anaesthesia, bladder or bowel dysfunction) occurred in 70% patients (23 patients). Sacral chordoma should be considered in cases of back pain with coccydynia, especially with neurological symptoms."

Fifty-Three patients (33 women and 20 men, with an average age of 60.8 years) were evaluated retrospectively by neurosurgery. All of the patients had received simple X-P, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgery. The neurological findings were evaluated on admission and in a follow-up review. Surgical intervention was performed on all patients and they underwent gross-total cyst removal. During surgery, the origin of a cyst was well observed. Follow-up data ranged from 6 to 46 months. Patient outcome was graded on a scale of excellent, good, or poor. Histological findings were evaluated. In 53 patients 58 cysts were identified. Four of the patients had multiple cysts. All cysts were associated with mobile spine. Fifty-five cysts were found in the lumbo-sacral region, two cysts were found in the cervico-thoracic region and one cyst in the thoracic region. Forty-two patients presented back pain and 52 patients presented radicular pain. Four patients had a cauda equina syndrome. Sensory disturbance was observed in 24 cases and motor weakness was observed in 21 cases. Claudication was observed in 19 cases. All cases with cervico-thoracic or thoracic cysts presented myelopathy. The duration of these clinical symptoms ranged from 10 days to 10 years. After surgery there was no case of a recurrent cyst during the follow-up period. Thirty-four cases had an excellent outcome, 18 a good outcome, and one a poor outcome. Out of 58 cysts 32 were joint cysts (11 synovial cysts, 21 ganglion cysts). A further 19 were flavum cysts, one was a posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) cyst and six others were unknown pseudo cysts. In 34 of the cysts we found hemosiderin deposits and in eight amyloid deposits. Present investigation and findings in literature show a clear comparison of these cystic formations and the mobile part of the spine. An anatomical relation to a vertebral joint (""facet"") is only found in some of the cases (32 of 58). Further to that, the name ""cyst"" is not correct either, because most of the cystic formations are presented without a cell lining on their internal wall and therefore they are pseudo-cystic. We think that these cystic formations should be called ""cystic formations of mobile spine"" (CYFMOS) rather than ""juxtafacet cysts"". A surgical intervention is the best treatment for these cysts if they cause a compression of nerve roots or/and of the spinal cord."

From August 2002 to July 2004, 283 patients (216 females; mean age: 73.8 +/- 9.9 years) underwent PVP on 749 vertebrae. Pain was evaluated with the pain intensity numeric rating scale (PI-NRS) (0 = no pain; 10 = worst pain) before the procedure and at the end point in September 2004 (follow-up:1-24 months; median: 7 months). A reduction of at least two points of the PI-NRS score was considered clinically relevant. Two hundred four patients were available for evaluation at the end point. Overall results showed a reduction of the median pain score from 8 at baseline to 1 at the end point (p < 0.0001); a clinically relevant pain reduction was observed in 176/205 patients (86%); 89/147 patients (61%) gave up a brace support (p < 0.0001); and 117/190 patients (62%) gave up drug therapy. Results were similar in different subgroups stratified according to age, underlying pathology, number of fractured or treated vertebrae, and length of follow-up. This study adds evidence that PVP is effective in treating painful vertebral fractures. A significant reduction in drug assumption and significant mobility improvement can also be achieved."

During the physical examination, a monstrous skin tumor was found on the back of the patient. MRI showed cerebellopontine angle tumors in the area of the trigeminal nerve and the beginnings of hydrocephalus. A diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 was made on this basis. This disease, which is also called Recklinghausen's disease, belongs to a group of diseases called phakomatosis. It can develop due to the inheritance of an autosomal dominant trait, but can also arise through new mutations. Treatment varies with the symptoms. In the present case, the tumor was surgically removed without complications."

Primary spinal cord tumours in the cancer patients may be deceptive and considered as the recurrent first cancer. Therefore, it should be precisely differentiated and appropriately managed. We report such a case of intramedullary ependymoma of the cervical spinal cord mimicking metatstatic recurrent lymphoma and causing cord compression. A 50-year-old man developed intramedullary ependymoma of the cervical spinal cord 1.5 years following chemoradiation for Waldeyer's ring lymphoma. He presented with a 2-month history of neck pain, progressive upper- and lower-extremity numbness and weakness, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intramedullary expansive lesion extending from C4 to C6 levels of the cervical spinal cord. The clinical and radiological findings were suggestive of malignant process. A comprehensive investigation failed to detect another site of disease. He underwent operation, and the tumour was subtotally resected. The patient's neurological deficits improved subsequently. The development of the intramedullary ependymoma following treating lymphoma has not been reported. We describe the clinical, radiological and pathological findings of this case and review the literature."

CD008686,0,17142646,0,Differential and synergistic effects of selective norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitors in rodent models of pain.,"There is increasing recognition that norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (NRIs and SRIs) are efficacious in treating some types of pain. To date, studies have not systematically evaluated the relative activity at the NE and/or 5-HT transporter required for maximal efficacy in rodent pain models. Known selective NE and 5-HT reuptake inhibitors reboxetine, desipramine, fluoxetine, and paroxetine were evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Using the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain, the compounds differentially reversed tactile allodynia. Evaluation of a broader spectrum of reuptake inhibitors in the para-phenylquinone (PPQ)-induced abdominal constriction model, a model of acute visceral pain, demonstrated that both the SRIs and the NRIs significantly blocked abdominal constrictions. However, the magnitude of this effect was greater following treatment with compounds having greater affinity for NRI compared with SRI affinity. In addition, isobolographic analyses indicated significant synergistic effects for all combinations of desipramine and fluoxetine in the PPQ model of visceral pain. Collectively, the present results support the hypothesis that compounds with greater NRI activity should be more effective for the treatment of pain than compounds having only SRI activity, and this hypothesis is also supported by clinical data. These studies also suggest that the potency and effectiveness of NRIs might be enhanced by the presence of 5-HT activity."

She was initially and had been repeatedly misdiagnosed as having neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1). The diagnosis of BML was not obvious due to its rare nature, the patient's not detailing the specifics of her gynecologic history of having undergone resection of a large uterine leiomyoma and followed by disseminated pelvic leiomyomatous nodules, histologic misinterpretation of an extrauterine lesion of the spine and the brachial plexus as a neurofibroma and the radiologic diagnosis of lung nodules as being ""non-specific"" in nature. In addition and importantly, no clinical, radiographic or histologic features of NF 1 were present.

CD008686,0,17134117,0,"Primary central nervous system lymphoma: presentation, diagnosis and staging.","Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the brain, spinal cord, leptomeninges, and eyes. The clinical presentation and neuroimaging appearance of PCNSL differ in immunocompetent patients and in those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A magnetic resonance (MR) image of the brain in immunocompetent patients with PCNSL typically demonstrates one or more homogeneously enhancing lesions located in the periventricular white matter, characteristically spanning the corpus callosum. In patients with AIDS, multiple ring-enhancing lesions are more common. After neuroimages raising the suspicion of PCNSL are obtained, a definitive diagnosis should be established in both immunocompetent and AIDS patients by performing pathological analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), vitreous fluid, or a biopsy specimen. Brain biopsy sampling remains the gold standard for PCNSL diagnosis in all patients, although the possibility of establishing routine, minimally invasive diagnostic procedures in which Epstein-Barr virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the CSF and nuclear imaging are used is currently under investigation in the population of patients with AIDS. At the time of diagnosis, the patient should undergo further evaluation, which should include a physical examination, ophthalmic evaluation with a slit-lamp examination, serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, human immunodeficiency virus testing, computed tomography scans of the chest/abdomen/pelvis, bone marrow biopsy sampling, contrast-enhanced brain MR imaging, and lumbar puncture (LP). Testicular ultrasonography studies should be considered in men.

CD008686,0,17120898,0,Regression of retroodontoid pseudotumors following C-1 laminoplasty. Report of three cases.,"The authors report a new technique for C-1 laminoplasty without fusion in the treatment of cervical myelopathy associated with a retroodontoid pseudotumor (also known as a phantom tumor). The authors review the cases of three patients who underwent C-1 laminoplasty in which hydroxyapatite was used and fusion was not performed. All patients suffered from severe progressive myelopathy before surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a retroodontoid pseudotumor compressing the spinal cord at the C-1 level in all cases. Computed tomography was performed to examine the extent of bone erosion at the atlantoaxial joint and dens. Clinical parameters included neurological function, measured using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, and neck pain. Imaging parameters included pre- and postoperative atlas-dens intervals; the space available for the spinal cord; instability of the atlantoaxial joints; osteoarthritic changes of the atlantoaxial joint; postoperative changes in T2 high-intensity signal; and postoperative alteration in the size of the pseudotumor. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated complete disappearance of the pseudotumor in two cases and partial reduction in one case. In all three cases sufficient neurological recovery was observed. The mean recovery rate was 87.0%. This new technique is less invasive than standard procedures, preserves the cervical range of motion, and avoids the morbidity of obtaining a bone graft and placing instrumentation. The authors conclude that C-1 laminoplasty without fusion is an option in the surgical management of cervical myelopathy associated with a retroodontoid pseudotumor, either without C1-2 instability or with slight, but reducible, C1-2 instability."

We report here our successful experience using irinotecan and cisplatin in three consecutive infants with progressing intramedullary astrocytomas. The first patient was a 16-month-old girl who presented with a grade III intramedullary astrocytoma that rapidly progressed after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Weekly irinotecan (50 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)) for four consecutive weeks (one cycle) for a total of four cycles (I/C regimen) was used in order to avoid or delay radiotherapy. Radiological complete remission was achieved 10 months after completion of therapy, and 3.5 years after diagnosis the patient remains disease free. The second patient was a 19-month-old boy with a C3-T4 grade II intramedullary astrocytoma who received up-front vincristine and carboplatin for two months but remained clinically symptomatic. A followup MRI showed a larger tumor, and the patient was switched to the I/C regimen. A marked clinical improvement occurred after the first cycle, and MRI showed a very good partial remission at the end of therapy. At 16 months after diagnosis, the patient remains disease free. The third patient was a 10-month-old girl with a C2-T3 grade II intramedullary astrocytoma. She presented with severe pain that became steroid dependent during the month she was treated with the vincristine-carboplatin regimen. When she was switched to the I/C regimen, the clinical symptoms responded within days. MRI at the end of therapy showed a significant reduction in tumor size, and one year after diagnosis the patient remains symptom free. Using this I/C regimen for childhood intramedullary astrocytoma, we obtained remarkable clinicoradiological responses while avoiding the use of radiotherapy."

Very rarely they have been observed in lumbar vertebrae. We report a neurilemoma involving the lower thoracic spine and present the clinical, radiological and histological findings with surgical management and 5-year follow-up. An 18-year-old-male presented with back pain and deteriorating locomotor function. Neurological examination revealed wasting of both calves and weakness in plantar flexion and dorsiflexion bilaterally. X-rays showed a D12 vertebral body abnormality with cystic changes and collapse of the body and pedicle. MRI showed a tumor occupying the D12 vertebrae with perivertibral protrusion compressing the thecal sac. Surgical decompression, excision and stabilisation with an extendable cage, bone graft and anterior rod system were achieved through a thoracolumbar approach. Histology results confirmed an intraosseous schwannoma with no remnants of an originating nerve. These tumors are rare but can be successfully treated with surgical excision and maintenance of spinal stability with recovery of neurological and functional change. Recurrence is uncommon."

We present two pediatric patients who developed ascending motoric paraplegia (AMP) following intrathecal chemotherapy. Both patients suffered from progressive weakness of their lower extremities, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, autonomous neural dysregulation and minor sensory deficits. Despite an initially similar clinical picture, progression and outcome were fairly different.

CD008686,0,17072572,0,[Spondylarthritides].,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the major subtype and a major outcome of an interrelated group of rheumatic diseases now named as spondyloarthritides (SpA). The most important clinical features of this group are inflammatory back pain (IBP), asymmetric peripheral oligoarthritis, predominantly of the lower limbs, and enthesitis. Established classification criteria for AS and SpA are known to perform less well in early disease stages. This partly contributes to the delay in diagnosis, mainly due the high frequency of back pain in the population. The methods for making an early diagnosis have recently improved. The major factors involved in this improvement are HLA B27 and magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints, but also of the spine. Conventional radiography, however, is still the gold standard. International recommendations for the management of AS have recently been published. Conventional medical treatment is based mainly on the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs); patients with peripheral arthritis may be treated with sulfasalazine. Patients with persistently active disease benefit from therapy with anti-TNF agents. Physiotherapy is of major importance in the general approach to patients with SpA, especially with AS."

Metastases from lung cancer traditionally have been believed to be relatively responsive to radiation therapy. However, conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large single-fraction doses of radiation and simultaneously limit the dose to radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. The current study evaluated the efficacy of single-fraction radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal lung cancer metastases."
CD008686,0,17062714,0,Treatment for myeloma bone disease.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B cell malignancy characterized by enhanced bone loss commonly associated with diffuse osteopenia, focal lytic lesions, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and bony pain. Bone destruction in MM results from asynchronous bone turnover wherein increased osteoclastic bone resorption is not accompanied by a comparable increase in bone formation. Consequently, patients with MM frequently require radiation therapy, surgery, and analgesic medications. The recent development of minimally invasive surgical procedures such as kyphoplasty allows patients with myeloma with vertebral compression fractures to have immediate improvement in their quality of life with shorter hospital stays. Bisphosphonates are specific inhibitors of osteoclastic activity, and these agents have been evaluated in patients with MM with bone disease during the past 15 years. Monthly i.v. infusions of either pamidronate or zoledronic acid have reduced the skeletal complications among patients with MM and are now a mainstay of myeloma therapy. Orally administered bisphosphonates, in contrast, have shown little ability to slow the development of skeletal complications in these patients. Although preclinical studies suggest that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates have potent antitumor effects, clinical trials will be necessary, probably at higher doses given more slowly, to establish their possible antitumor effects clinically. Moreover, recent advances in the use of bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals make these attractive therapeutic candidates to combine with bisphosphonates or radiosensitizing drugs (e.g., bortezomib) to achieve a synergistic effect. As our understanding of the pathophysiology of myeloma bone disease continues to grow, new target therapies will continue to emerge, offering new and more advanced options for the management of myeloma bone disease."

CD008686,0,17042056,0,Diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis.,"This article focuses on the early diagnosis and effective management of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a disease that is not uncommon and that can cause early retirement and severe functional disability. AS, like most other rheumatologic diseases, has no diagnostic gold standard. Correct diagnosis depends largely on a constellation of clinical symptoms and signs in addition to radiological findings. Early diagnosis has become all the more important because effective therapies are available: tumor necrosis factor antagonists that suppress disease activity and improve functional ability in patients with AS refractory to conventional drug therapy. The biologic agents are probably even more effective if given early. Inflammation of the sacroiliac joints and the spine is a common, early feature and possibly the most frequent first manifestation of disease. Therefore, its early detection is important, and magnetic resonance imaging has proven useful in this regard. To optimize diagnostic accuracy of early disease, it is crucial to use a comprehensive approach and have a deep understanding of the disease and its clinical picture. The clinician should gather a complete history, paying close attention to all the elements of this multisystem disease, as well as judiciously ordering laboratory testing and imaging. New strategies are being developed to assist primary care physicians in their screening for these patients, which in turn should result in early referral to rheumatologists and early diagnosis."
CD008686,0,17040583,0,Spinal accessory nerve function after neck dissections.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate spinal accessory nerve function after functional neck dissection (FND) and radical neck dissection (RND) by monitoring the nerve with electromyographic (EMG) examinations. A prospective, double-blind, clinical study was undertaken in 21 patients (42 neck side dissections) operated on for head and neck malignant diseases, separated into two groups: 10 neck sides in the RND group and 32 neck sides in the FND group. Electromyographic examinations were performed pre-operatively and post-operatively in the third week and third and ninth months. Additionally, a questionnaire, modified from the neck dissection impairment index, was applied to all the patients in order to assess shoulder function in the ninth post-operative month. All patients had maximum EMG scores pre-operatively. Following the operation, motor amplitudes decreased in both groups. At the third post-operative month, amplitudes decreased to their lowest values. As expected, the decreases in amplitude and EMG score were more prominent in the RND group. Following reinnervation, the amplitudes of the trapezius motor response increased in the FND group but never reached pre-operative values (during the time of follow up). The FND group scores for pain, neck and shoulder stiffness, and disability in heavy object lifting, light object lifting and reaching overhead were significantly lower than those of the RND group. In FND, one aims to preserve anatomically the spinal accessory nerve, and it is presumed to be intact after the procedure. However, using EMG nerve function monitoring, our study revealed that profound spinal nerve injury was detected immediately after FND surgery, which tended to improve over subsequent months but had not regained its original function by the end of the ninth post-operative month."
CD008686,0,17039143,0,Alveolar echinococcosis of the spine.,"Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a rare parasitic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis. It differs from cystic echinococcosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus. The main endemic areas of AE are Alaska, Canada, Japan, and parts of Europe. Hepatic involvement invariably occurs, but it is unusual for bone to be affected. We report the case of a woman presenting with a long history of pain, cachexia, morning stiffness, and biological signs of inflammation. Radiographs and principally magnetic resonance images were nonspecific, showing inhomogeneous osteolysis of vertebral bodies without loss of intervertebral disc height but with a paravertebral mass. The diagnosis ultimately relied on pathological examination, which showed an anhistic laminated membrane colored in red with Periodic-Acid-Schiff surrounding a central cavity, and by the serologic testing, principally ELISA Em2(+) method, which allowed a 97% specificity and 99% specificity in the diagnosis of AE. AE involving bone is an uncommon condition. Although magnetic resonance imaging can be used to search for local complications, the features it detects are, like those revealed by radiographs, nonspecific and can lead to AE being misdiagnosed as neoplasm or tuberculous osteitis. When a patient presents with suspected AE in an endemic area, the diagnosis can be achieved by serological testing alone (Western blot and Em2(+) ELISA), thereby avoiding the need for biopsy."

CD008686,0,17019692,0,Paraplegia as the presenting manifestation of extramedullary megakaryoblastic transformation of previously undiagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia.,"Extramedullary tumors, also known as granulocytic sarcomas (GS), occur most frequently in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). They may signal the onset of the accelerated phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or the blastic transformation of a myeloproliferative disorder. Occasionally, a GS may be the presenting sign of undiagnosed AML, and rarely the presenting sign of undiagnosed CML or aleukemic leukemia. Paraplegia due to a spinal cord GS is an extremely rare presentation of undiagnosed leukemia. This is the first case report of paraplegia as the presenting manifestation of extramedullary megakaryoblastic transformation of previously undiagnosed CML. A 53-year-old woman reported back pain for 6 days, rapidly progressing to paraplegia. Physical examination noted a large abdominal mass and flaccid paralysis in both lower extremities. Spinal MRI revealed a T4-T6 vertebral mass causing spinal stenosis and cord compression. Tumor debulking and laminectomy were performed emergently. The tumor consisted of noncohesive blast cells. The CBC revealed a leukocyte count of 238,300/microl and a differential consistent with CML. Reexamination of the patient found that the abdominal mass was a giant spleen. Further immunohistochemical studies of the tumor were consistent with extramedullary acute megakaryoblastic blast transformation of CML. Although extramedullary blast crises herald the accelerated phases in approximately 10% of CML cases, megakaryoblastic blast transformation of CML accounts for less than 3% of these cases.

All patients were men, with a mean age of 41.6 years. The lungs were involved in 11 cases (84.6%) and only two cases had mycosis limited to the central nervous system. Co-morbidity was observed in four patients (malignant neoplasm in three and diabetes mellitus in one). The most frequent neurological manifestations were paresis (eight cases), headache (five cases) and gait disturbance (four cases). Neuroimaging diagnosis showed a predominance of multiple round lesions with ring enhancement following contrast medium injection. Lesions were seen in the brain hemispheres (nine cases), thalamus (nine cases), cerebellum (four cases), brainstem (four cases) and spinal cord (four cases). Most cases responded well to therapy. Lesions with enhancement following contrast medium injection persisted in four patients for a period of 6 months to 8 years. These findings emphasize the importance of considering NPCM in the differential diagnosis of brain and spinal cord lesions in endemic areas of paracoccidioidomycosis."

The clinical picture depends upon the size and localization of the tumor in relation to the cross section and the height along the longitudinal axis of the spinal cord. Typical symptoms due to transverse damage of the spinal cord are complete lesion, Brown-Sequard syndrome, a lesion of the central spinal cord, and posterior cord syndrome. Tetraparesis, spastic, or flaccid paraparesis result from lesions at the cervical spine, thoracic spine, or below the first lumbar vertebral body, respectively."

Although narrowing of intervertebral disc spaces, irregular ossification of the vertebral end-plate as well as osteophytes, facet joint osteoarthritis and spondylolisthesis can be observed, early changes in the discs or the subdiscal bone can not be detected by x-rays. Moreover, 3-dimensional imaging is not possible. Computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are reliable for identifying disorders of the spine and soft-tissue. Differentiation between inflammation, trauma and tumor is possible. There is still a problem with the relationship between the information obtained by x-rays or MRI and clinical symptoms. Therefore, interpretation of radiological examinations assumes a knowledge of clinical symptoms and the different kinds of diseases which are possible."

CD008686,0,16967616,0,[Ankylosing spondylitis--the current situation and new therapeutic options].,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, immunologically mediated rheumatic disease whose progression largely depends on the extent of inflammatory activity. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), therapeutic control of AS is very limited. Therapy of ankylosing spondylitis should not only control inflammatory processes, but also prevent structural damages and maintain the functions. Until recently, physiotherapy and non-steroidal antiphlogistics (NSA) therapy was a gold standard of AS treatment. NSA therapy alleviates inflammatory pain of spine in 60 to 80% of patients. According to the most recent findings, long-term administration of NSA can affect also X-ray progression. DMARD therapy, which is efficient in RA, has insignificant effect on axial form of AS. Sulfasalazine proved to be efficacious against peripheral form of AS; administration of MTX and leflunomide is not supported by controlled studies. Peripheral arthritis and enthesitis is usually treated by short-term application of corticoids. The fact remains that an important role in AS immunopathogenesis is played by TNF alpha whose increased levels were found in patients with AS in serum, synovial fluid and SI joints. Anti-TNF therapy with infliximab and etanercept proved to be highly efficacious in patients with AS resistant to conventional therapy. Infliximab and etanercept reduced the disease activity (50% improvement in more than half of patients), improved the function and slowed down the structural damage. MRI studies of anti-TNF therapy proved reduction of inflammatory activity in SI joints and spine. Other studies verified the efficacy of adalimumab in AS therapy and showed that adalimumab is a promising drug. Also, several randomized clinical studies proved efficacy of thalidomide whose administration, however, is limited by its severe adverse effects. Until now, the results of studies focused on pamidronate therapy appear to be rather controversial. Better understanding of AS pathogenesis led to implementation of new therapeutic procedures that significantly improve activity and functional condition of patients."

The use of early radiographic evaluation is often unnecessary for uncomplicated acute low back injuries. Select patient populations have been identified for early evaluation. If the following red flags are associated with the pain, spinal imaging is indicated: possible fracture, neoplasm, infection, and cauda equina syndrome.

Laboratory studies were unremarkable. Computed tomographic scan showed a mixed lytic and sclerotic process at the T5-T6 level of the vertebral column in continuity with an adjacent paravertebral soft tissue mass. Nuclear medicine scan demonstrated increased uptake in the T5 vertebral body. Histology revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating mature, gliotic neural tissue, with areas of necrosis and prominent perivascular space involvement. Associated vertebral fragments showed bone destruction, reactive bone formation, and fibrosis. By immunohistochemistry, the carcinoma cells were positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 5/6, EMA, and MIC-2 (membranous staining).

Abnormal contour of L1 and L2 vertebrae and intervertebral disc space was noted during radiologic examination. Pseudoarthrosis was suspected based on extensive osseous resorption and reactive sclerosis about the discovertebral junction on magnetic resonance imaging study. She underwent emergency operation due to spinal instability with neurologic deficit. Pseudoarthrosis was confirmed intraoperatively. No evidence of infection or neoplasms was found.

Conventional treatments can be successful in alleviating symptoms; however, this approach has not been shown to halt the progression of disease. The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is central to the pathogenesis of AS. Several anti-TNF drugs have been developed and have been shown to control symptoms effectively, and possibly to prevent both clinical and radiographic progression of disease, in patients with AS.

Although treatment of MESCC remains a palliative endeavor, emerging surgical techniques, in combination with imaging modalities that detect spinal metastatic disease at an early stage, are resulting in improved outcomes. Here, we review the clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up and management options in the management of MESCC. A treatment paradigm is outlined with emphasis on early circumferential surgical decompression of the spinal cord with concomitant spinal stabilization. Radiation therapy has a clearly defined role in the treatment of patients with MESCC, particularly those with radiation-sensitive tumors in the setting of non-bony spinal cord compression and those with a limited life expectancy. Spinal stereotactic radiosurgery, vertebroplasty, and kyphoplasty, are emerging treatment options that are beginning to be used in selected patients with MESCC."

CD008686,0,16918206,0,Anterior lumbar fusion with titanium threaded and mesh interbody cages.,"The authors report their experience with 42 patients in whom anterior lumbar fusion was performed using titanium cages as a versatile adjunct to treat a wide variety of spinal deformity and pathological conditions. These conditions included congenital, degenerative, iatrogenic, infectious, traumatic, and malignant disorders of the thoracolumbar spine. Fusion rates and complications are compared with data previously reported in the literature. Between July 1996 and July 1999 the senior authors (C.I.S., R.P.N., and M.J.R.) treated 42 patients by means of a transabdominal extraperitoneal (13 cases) or an anterolateral extraperitoneal approach (29 cases), 51 vertebral levels were fused using titanium cages packed with autologous bone. All vertebrectomies (27 cases) were reconstructed using a Miami Moss titanium mesh cage and Kaneda instrumentation. Interbody fusion (15 cases) was performed with either the BAK titanium threaded interbody cage (in 13 patients) or a Miami Moss titanium mesh cage (in two patients). The average follow-up period was 14.3 months. Seventeen patients had sustained a thoracolumbar burst fracture, 12 patients presented with degenerative spinal disorders, six with metastatic tumor, four with spinal deformity (one congenital and three iatrogenic), and three patients presented with spinal infections. In five patients anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) was supplemented with posterior segmental fixation at the time of the initial procedure. Of the 51 vertebral levels treated, solid arthrodesis was achieved in 49, a 96% fusion rate. One case of pseudarthrosis occurred in the group treated with BAK cages; the diagnosis was made based on the patient's continued mechanical back pain after undergoing L4-5 ALIF. The patient was treated with supplemental posterior fixation, and successful fusion occurred uneventfully with resolution of her back pain. In the group in which vertebrectomy was performed there was one case of fusion failure in a patient with metastatic breast cancer who had undergone an L-3 corpectomy with placement of a mesh cage. Although her back pain was immediately resolved, she died of systemic disease 3 months after surgery and before fusion could occur. Complications related to the anterior approach included two vascular injuries (two left common iliac vein lacerations); one injury to the sympathetic plexus; one case of superficial phlebitis; two cases of prolonged ileus (greater than 48 hours postoperatively); one anterior femoral cutaneous nerve palsy; and one superficial wound infection. No deaths were directly related to the surgical procedure. There were no cases of dural laceration and no nerve root injury. There were no cases of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, retrograde ejaculation, abdominal hernia, bowel or ureteral injury, or deep wound infection. Fusion-related complications included an iliac crest hematoma and prolonged donor-site pain in one patient. There were no complications related to placement or migration of the cages, but there was one case of screw fracture of the Kaneda device that did not require revision. The authors conclude that anterior lumbar fusion performed using titanium interbody or mesh cages, packed with autologous bone, is an effective, safe method to achieve fusion in a wide variety of pathological conditions of the thoracolumbar spine. The fusion rate of 96% compares favorably with results reported in the literature. The complication rate mirrors the low morbidity rate associated with the anterior approach. A detailed study of clinical outcomes is in progress. Patient selection and strategies for avoiding complication are discussed."

The procedure was carried out under spinal anesthesia. No adverse events occurred during puncture or surgery, or in the immediate postoperative recovery period. Recovery from the sensory and motor block was normal. Twenty-four hours after surgery gluteal and lower limb pain and paresthesia developed, with no sensory or motor deficit. The symptoms suggested transient neurological syndrome. This syndrome has been defined by pain in the lower limbs, buttocks, thighs and calves after uncomplicated spinal anesthesia and full recovery from the sensorimotor block during the immediate postoperative period (first 24 hours). The condition is self-limiting and does not leave permanent neurological sequelae. Recent studies have demonstrated biochemical and anatomical changes that provide a structural basis for this clinical entity. According to this literature, transient neurological syndrome might be a mild expression of local anesthetic toxicity. Recent findings show that the initial injury to the nerve cell membrane, induced by high concentrations of local anesthetic could lead to permanent neuronal damage."

CD008686,0,16884424,0,Childhood glioblastoma multiforme of the spinal cord.,"Astrocytoma accounts for more than 50% of all central nervous system tumours diagnosed, with particular prevalence in the 15- to 34-year-old age bracket, rarely arising in younger children. In 1995, a 7-year-old boy presented in Emergency with a 3-day history of severe radicular back pain and associated muscle spasms, exacerbated by lying on his back. Both bone scan and plain X-rays were unremarkable; however, MRI showed a 3-cm space-occupying lesion at the level of T5-T6. The patient proceeded to biopsy and partial excision of the tumour through laminectomy, histology confirming an anaplastic astrocytoma (glioblastoma multiforme), St Anne Mayo grade 4. Treatment consisted of a radical course of radiotherapy alone, delivering a total dose of 44.8 Gy at 1.6 Gy per fraction. The treatment comprised of three phases using two oblique wedged fields on a 6 MV linear accelerator. The patient remains disease free 7 years post treatment, with the only effect noted being a slight kyphoscoliosis at the site of the laminectomy and radiation. This report highlights the efficacy of combined surgery and radiation therapy in the management of spinal cord glioblastoma multiforme in preventing tumour recurrence, with acceptable morbidity.

To analyse the incidence of primary tumours of the spine and to record the site of occurrence, sex distribution, survival and pathology of these tumours. Primary tumours of the spine are particularly rare, accounting for between 4 and 13% of published series of primary bone tumours. The Leeds Bone Tumour Registry was reviewed and a total of 2,750 cases of bone tumours and tumour-like cases were analysed. Consultants in orthopaedic surgery, neurosurgery, oncology and pathology in North and West Yorkshire and Humberside contribute to the Registry. Primary bone tumours of the osseous spine constitute only 126 of the 2,750 cases (4.6%). Chordoma was the most frequent tumour in the cervical and sacral regions, while the most common diagnosis overall was multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma. Osteosarcoma ranked third. The mean age of presentation was 42 years and pain was the most common presenting symptom, occurring in 95% of malignant and 76% of benign tumours. Neurological involvement occurred in 52% of malignant tumours and usually meant a poor prognosis. The establishment of Bone Tumour Registries is the only way that sufficient data on large numbers of these rare tumours can be accumulated to provide a valuable and otherwise unavailable source of information for research, education and clinical follow-up."

CD008686,0,16850132,0,Carcinomatous meningitis from non-small-cell lung cancer responding to gefitinib.,"The prognosis for carcinomatous meningitis remains poor, and focal neurological dysfunctions usually do not improve despite the available treatment options. We report a case of carcinomatous meningitis from non-small-cell lung cancer treated with gefitinib, which brought about a sustained clinical response. A 40-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in the right lower lobe of the lung, and with multiple pulmonary and brain metastases. Six courses of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy and gamma-knife radiosurgery induced a near complete response in all lesions. However, 2 months later, cauda equina syndrome and left oculomotor paralysis from carcinomatous meningitis developed rapidly. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord revealed the enhancement of leptomeningeal disseminations. The patient was treated with 250 mg/day gefitinib. All his neurological symptomatology disappeared within 2 weeks. The shrinkage of the leptomeningeal disseminations was confirmed by follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. The patient is currently doing well and is able to work. Cancer relapse was not observed at 4 months after the initiation of gefitinib. Although the survival benefit is controversial, gefitinib may have a role in the treatment of carcinomatous meningitis from non-small-cell lung cancer to improve neurological dysfunctions."
CD008686,0,16845308,0,Capillary hemangioma of the cauda equina presenting with radiculopathy and papilledema.,"A 42-year-old, non-obese man with a three-month history of headache, pulsatile tinnitus, transient visual obscurations, and scintillations later developed low back pain with right lower extremity radiation. Brain MRI and magnetic resonance venography were normal, but spine MRI revealed a mass in the cauda equina. Neuro-ophthalmologic examination disclosed bilateral optic disc edema with normal visual function. During spine surgery, cerebrospinal fluid, released under high pressure despite prior hyperventilation, contained a glucose level of 51 mg/dl and a protein level of 1840 mg/dl. Histologic and immunohistochemical features of the lesion were compatible with a capillary hemangioma. Although spinal cord tumors have been associated with papilledema, this is the first report of a capillary hemangioma of the cauda equina in this context.

CD008686,0,16832584,0,Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS) and guanylate kinase 1 (GUK1) are differentially expressed in GH-secreting adenomas.,"Pituitary tumors, adenomas in their vast majority, represent around 10-15% of the intracranial neoplasms. Pituitary carcinomas are exceedingly rare. Clinically, these neoplasms cause hormonal dysfunctions, and mass effect symptoms as headache and visual disorders in the case of macroadenomas. Pituitary tumorigenesis is still poorly understood. In order to investigate the expression of cancer-related genes in pituitary tumors, we employed a human cancer cDNA macroarray membrane with 1176 well-characterized human genes related to cancer and tumor biology. We were able to identify several differentially expressed genes, among them hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS) and guanylate kinase 1 (GUK1) which were over expressed in a pool of clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, compared with a spinal cord metastasis of a nonfunctioning pituitary carcinoma. HGS and GUK1 mRNA expression were chosen to be validated by quantitative RT-qPCR, however, only GUK1 had the differential expression confirmed between the adenomas and the metastasis of a pituitary carcinoma. We have also investigated HGS and GUK1 mRNA expressions in a series of 46 pituitary adenomas (18 nonfunctioning, 12 GH-secreting, nine PRL-secreting, and seven ACTH-secreting adenomas). HGS and GUK1 were significantly over expressed in GH-secreting adenomas, compared with ACTH-secreting adenomas and nonfunctioning tumors, and with PRL-secreting adenomas, respectively. We have shown that these genes, involved in tumorigenesis in other tissues, are as well over expressed in the pituitary tumors, however, their role in the oncogenesis of these tumors need to be further investigated."

CD008686,0,16807981,0,Postoperative spinal epidural hematoma: risk factor and clinical outcome.,"We report a series of epidural hematomas which cause neurologic deterioration after spinal surgery, and have taken risk factors and prognostic factors into consideration. We retrospectively reviewed the database of 3720 cases of spine operation in a single institute over 7 years (1998 April- 2005 July). Nine patients who demonstrated neurologic deterioration after surgery and required surgical decompression were identified. Factors postulated to increase the postoperative epidural hematoma and to improve neurologic outcome were investigated. The incidence of postoperative epidural hematoma was 0.24%. Operation sites were cervical 3 cases, thoracic 2 cases, and lumbar 4 cases. Their original diagnoses were tumor 3 cases, cervical stenosis 2 cases, lumbar stenosis 3 cases and herniated lumbar disc 1 case. The symptoms of epidural hematomas were neurologic deterioration and pain. After decompression, clinical outcome revealed complete recovery in 3 cases (33.3%), incomplete recovery in 5 cases (55.6%) and no change in 1 case (11.1%). Factors increasing the risk of postoperative epidural hematoma were coagulopathy from medical illness or anticoagulation therapy (4 cases, 44.4%) and highly vascularized tumor (3 cases, 33.3%). The time interval to evacuation of complete recovery group (29.3 hours) was shorter than incomplete recovery group (66.3 hours). Patients with coagulopathy and highly vascularized tumor were more vulnerable to spinal epidural hematoma. The postoperative outcome was related to the preoperative neurological deficit and the time interval to the decompression."

CD008686,0,16778468,0,Neurosyphilis manifesting as spinal transverse myelitis.,"Spinal myelitis caused by neurosyphilis is an extremely rare disease, and there are only few visual examples of magnetic resonance imaging scans. We present a clinical case of neurosyphilis, which is of great importance concerning diagnostic, differential diagnosis, and tactics of management. A patient complaining of progressive legs weakness, numbness, and shooting-like pain in the legs as well as pelvic dysfunction was admitted to the hospital. Neurological examination revealed spinal cord lesion symptoms: legs weakness, impairment of superficial and deep sensation together with pathological symptoms in the legs. Hernia of intervertebral disc or tumor was suspected, and myelography with computed tomography of the spine was performed. No pathological findings were observed. More precise examination of the patient (a small scar in the genitals and condylomata lata in anal region were noticed) pointed to possible syphilis-induced spinal cord lesion. Serologic syphilis diagnostic tests (Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay, reagin plasma response, serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and cerebrospinal fluid tests (general cerebrospinal fluid test and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test) confirmed the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Spinal cord lesion determined by magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated as spinal syphilis or syphilis-induced myelitis. Conventional treatment showed a partial effect."
CD008686,0,16774557,0,Fungal osteoarticular infections in patients treated at a comprehensive cancer centre: a 10-year retrospective review.,"This study reviewed retrospectively the clinical characteristics of 28 cancer patients with fungal osteoarticular infections (FOAIs) between 1995 and 2005. Most patients (26; 93%) had haematological malignancies (19 had leukaemia); half (14) were allogeneic stem-cell transplant recipients. Twelve patients (43%) had severe neutropenia (< or = 100/mm3) with a mean duration of 65 days (range 10-500 days), and ten (36%) patients had received a significant dose of corticosteroids. Most (19; 68%) FOAIs were caused by contiguous extension, while nine (32%) were associated with haematogenous spread. Pain, joint instability and local drainage were seen in 28 (100%), six (21%), and seven (25%) patients, respectively. Sixteen (57%) patients had symptoms for < 1 month. The sinuses (ten; 36%) and the vertebral spine (six; 21%) were the most common sites involved. Moulds were the predominant pathogens: Aspergillus fumigatus (two); non-fumigatus Aspergillus spp. (eight); non-specified Aspergillus spp. (three); Fusarium spp. (six); Zygomycetes (five); Scedosporium apiospermum (two); and Exserohilum sp. (one). Candida was the causative pathogen in four cases (including two cases of mixed FOAIs). Arthritis and post-operative FOAIs were both uncommon manifestations, occurring in two patients each. All patients received systemic antifungal therapy (combinations in 20 cases), and 19 cases underwent adjunctive surgery. The crude mortality rates (at 12 weeks) were 44% (9/20) in the patients who underwent surgery and antifungal therapy vs. 33% (2/6) in patients who received antifungal therapy alone (p not significant). FOAI is a rare, yet severe, manifestation of localised or systemic mycoses, caused predominantly by moulds, and is seen typically in patients with haematological malignancies."
CD008686,0,16773516,0,[Joint involvement in chronic inflammatory bowel disease--current diagnostics and treatment options].,"Joint involvement is the most frequent extra-intestinal manifestation of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Arthralgias are common and spondylarthropathy may affect peripheral joints, the spine as well as tendons. Clinical assessment has the greatest impact on diagnostics and therapy. In particular, a history of ""inflammatory back pain"" should lead to further investigations. HLA-B27 may be indicative of ankylosing spondylitis in IBD. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are preferred diagnostic modalities for the assessment of inflammation. Arthralgia often improves during treatment of IBD. In contrast, polyarticular arthritis, sacroiliitis, ankylosing spondylitis and enthesitis often require additional continuous therapy. Baseline therapy includes analgesics, intra-articular corticosteroid administration, and physiotherapy. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as sulfasalazine and methotrexate are used in polyarticular arthritis. Sulfasalazine may be effective in patients with early axial disease as well. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocking agents may be employed in patients with active disease not responding to conventional treatment. For patients who fail to respond to TNF blockade, the emergence of other targets of the inflammatory cascade may provide more treatment choices in the future."

CD008686,0,16768759,0,35-year-old woman with progressive bilateral leg weakness.,"A 35-year-old woman presented with one month's history of progressive bilateral leg weakness and altered sensation. There had been no pain. She had noted urinary frequency and constipation in the previous two weeks. On examination, the patient had diffuse lower extremity weakness (2-3/5), with a T6 sensory level to pain and temperature sensation. MRI demonstrated a T4-5 intradural mass ventral to the spinal cord, with an enhancing dural tail, consistent with meningioma. At surgery an intradural, extramedullary, firm, black neoplasm was encountered, which invaded the ventral dura and elevated and distorted the spinal cord. The mass was removed, leaving only microscopic invasion of the ventral dura. There was no bone invasion. Serial sections revealed a homogeneous black tumor without necrosis. H&E stained sections showed an occasionally fascicular tumor of melanocytes and small round blue tumor spindle cells with melanin pigmentation and 1-2 mitotic figures per 10 high-powered fields. The nuclei are generally oval-shaped and elongated, with prominent nucleoli. Necrosis, hemorrhage, and nuclear and cellular pleomorphism are not present and mitotic figures are rare. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for S-100 and HMB-45. MIB-1 labeling averaged 1-2%. A diagnosis of primary meningeal melanocytic tumor was made. Primary meningeal melanocytic tumors (PMMTs) are rare; fewer than 100 cases have been described. PMMTs of the CNS consist of a spectrum of tumors ranging from well-differentiated melanocytoma to its overtly malignant counterpart, melanoma. Intermediate grade melanocytomas (IMGs) are the least common variant, comprising about 10% of PMMTs reported. IGMS occur in the spinal leptomeninges and intracranially in approximately equal proportions. IGMs are more cellular than the well-differentiated variant, with 1-3 mitotic figures per 10 HPFs and MIB-1 labeling of <6%. By contrast, melanomas contain more mitotic figures (3-15 per 10 HPF) and MIB-1 labeling rates up to 15%. Once metastasis, including drop metastasis from pigmented medulloblastomas, have been excluded, the differential includes pigmented meningiomas and schwannomas (solitary or as part of Carney complex), as well as other pigmented CNS tumors such as ependymoma and pineoblastoma and systemic diseases such as lymphoma . . . For primary CNS melanocytic neoplasms, complete tumor resection is preferred, as it leads to cure of well-differentiated and intermediate-grade melanocytomas and most melanomas. Radiotherapy is recommended for incomplete resection of IMGs and melanomas; the recurrence potential of low-grade melanocytomas is less clear and watchful waiting may be employed, since recurrent tumors may be treated surgically prior to radiation. Two months after surgery, the patient had normal sensation and strength. She was given focused radiotherapy to the region of the ventral thecal sac to 40 cGy. At one year following surgery, the patient's neurological examination is normal and she remains free of residual disease by MR examination."
CD008686,0,16768252,0,Osteoid osteoma.,"Osteoid osteoma is a relatively frequent benign bone tumour, consisting of osteoid and woven bone, and surrounded by a halo of reactive sclerotic bone, with an average size of the nidus less than 1.5 cm. It is a condition of late childhood, adolescence and young adult age. It usually occurs in the appendicular skeleton and the spine, and is generally localised in or near the cortex. The lesion causes pain, especially at night, but can cause joint pain with synovitis and joint effusion if located in the vicinity of chondral structures, or painful scoliosis if located in the spine. Osteoid osteoma may have an unpredictable course, and may require treatment or resolve spontaneously. In some cases, the diagnostic approach is challenging; there are different treatment methods, some of which have been recently introduced, with promising results. We review the literature about the natural history, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach and classical or modern treatment modalities of osteoid osteoma."
CD008686,0,16767911,0,Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty: new equipment for malignant vertebral fractures treatment.,"The Purpose of our study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of Percutaneous Vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty, in the treatment of pain deriving from neoplastic vertebral compression fractures (VCF). We treated with these new techniques oncologic patients with unremitting pain over spine, refractory to the conventional medical therapy (analgesics, bed-rest, bracing and bisphosphonates), elicited by pressure over spinous process and in absence of neurological signs. Both methods demonstrated a swift pain relief associated with an evident augmentation in vertebral body resistance. Nevertheless only Kyphoplasty revealed itself able to restorate the original somatic morphology and to diminish the spinal kyphosis. Polymethylmethacrylate's leakages (PMMA) not observed in the Kyphoplasty, instead have been found in the Vertebroplasty localized in the intersomatic or perispinal areas. Neither confirmation of epidural or foraminal extravasations, nor complications which pulmonary embolism for the involvement of venous plexus or connected to phenomenon of infection having to do with the procedures. Kyphoplasty and Vertebroplasty are effective alternatives, simple and safe in the treatment of vertebral collapses consequent to aggressive haemangiomas, myelomas and metastases. This entails a complete relief of symptoms and restoration of mobility in 90% of patients within 24 hours from the procedure."
CD008686,0,16761740,0,Myeloma in young age.,"Total 14 cases of myeloma in young age group (<40 years) have been reported out of 178 cases of myeloma in a time period of 7 years (1993-1999). Males predominated overfe males. Like adult myeloma, patients presented mostly with the backache, pain in pelvis, lower spine and weakness in about 60% of cases followed by swelling of bone in 40% of cases. One case presented with bleeding gum, malena and hepatosplenomegaly and was diagnosed as plasma cell leukemia. Radiological examination revealed lytic lesion in almost all the cases with fracture femur and rib in 28.57% of cases. Anaemia and raised ESR was noted in all the cases. Myeloma typing revealed IgG myeloma in 10 cases, light chain myeloma in 3 cases and IgA myeloma in one case. None of the patient was traceable after 2 years. Thus our study concludes that myeloma in the young age in India occurs in increased frequency and clinically presents just like adult and elderly myeloma, but serologically are predominantly of IgG type. There is also an increased frequency of solitary plasmacytoma as compared to adult myeloma."

CD008686,0,16749755,0,Spinal lipomas.,"Lipomas of the spinal cord are among the most fascinating lesions encountered by the pediatric neurosurgeon. An understanding of spinal lipomas may, however, be difficult because the terminology used to describe the accumulations of spinal fat is confusing, inconsistently applied, and at times contradictory. An anatomical characterization of lipomas may assist in understanding these lesions. Lipomas of the spinal cord are very rare and cause symptoms related to mass effect and secondary compressive myelopathy. Lipomas of the conus medullaris (or lipomyelomeningocele) are the most common form of fatty masses in the spine and can be divided into dorsal, caudal, and transitional forms. These lesions are a manifestation of occult spinal dysraphism and a common cause of the tethered cord syndrome (TCS). The natural history of untreated lipomyelomeningocele, although incompletely understood, appears to be progressive neurological deterioration with loss of bladder control. Timely, careful surgical intervention may prevent significant neurological deterioration and progressive disability in the majority of children harboring these lesions. In surgical intervention the surgeon seeks to disrupt the connection between the fibrofatty mass and underlying cord as well as to reestablish normal anatomical planes. Several intraoperative video segments illustrating lipomyelomeningocele resection are included in this paper. Lipomas of the terminal filum (fatty filum) are truly occult and are also associated with TCS. Surgical treatment of filum lipomas carries significantly lower risk than that for lipomas of the conus medullaris. Again, the goal of surgery is to disrupt the connection between the abnormal fibrofatty tissue and the underlying spinal cord."

CD008686,0,16702748,0,Pulmonary adenocarcinoma associated with SAPHO syndrome difficult to differentiate from multiple bone metastasis.,"The patient was a 57-year-old man with a chief complaint of anterior chest pain who was diagnosed with clinical stage IV (c-T2N2M1) non-small-cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma). Tenderness in the sternoclavicular joint, acne, periodontitis, and palmoplantar pustulosis were evident, and SAPHO syndrome was diagnosed. SAPHO syndrome is a rare disorder that results in synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteomyelitis. Bone scintigraphy showed tracer accumulation in the costal cartilage, sternoclavicular joint, and cervical vertebrae 6-7. Although the bone lesions of SAPHO syndrome were difficult to differentiate from bone metastasis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic bone tumors were ruled out by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. There have been no previously reported cases of lung cancer with comorbid SAPHO syndrome. We report such a case and discuss the relevant literature, particularly that concerned with the evaluation of bone lesions."

Patients fulfilling the following criteria were included: (1) presentation with myelopathy without overt visual involvement at initial presentation; (2) demonstration with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of contiguously abnormal signal in the spinal cord spanning at least three vertebral segments without evidence of arteriovenous malformation or significant disk disease; (3) absence of systemic disease or neoplasm. All patients were women, identified themselves as African American and were older than 35 years. Pain was reported at initial presentation in four cases. The distinctive feature was a relapsing course with intervening variable improvement of function and progression to quadriplegia in less than 4 years. An increased IgG index and/or oligoclonal banding was detected in two patients. The leukocyte count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was elevated in all cases but in only one specimen did the count exceed 50 cells. None of the patients initially had clinical signs of an optic neuropathy but unilaterally prolonged visual evoked potentials were present in one individual who went on to developed optic neuritis 19 months after the first clinical presentation. Another patient developed optic neuritis 45 months after disease onset. Immunomodulatory and plasma exchange therapy were of some benefit at least early in the course but the disease progressed despite these interventions. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO)-IgG antibody, a serum or CSF marker described in individuals with classic NMO and optico-spinal multiple sclerosis (MS), was present in all cases. On the basis of shared clinical and imaging features in the cord, progressive necrotizing myelopathy observed in this case series exhibits key features of a limited form of NMO (Devic's disease) and opticospinal MS. The presence of NMO-IgG antibody marker suggests that progressive necrotizing myelopathy is part of a disease spectrum of which traditional NMO is a select presentation."

CD008686,0,16650839,0,Cardiac ankyrins: Essential components for development and maintenance of excitable membrane domains in heart.,"Ankyrins are intracellular proteins required for the biogenesis and maintenance of membrane domains in both excitable and non-excitable cells. Ankyrin family polypeptides have been implicated in the targeting and stabilization of membrane proteins including ion channels, transporters, exchangers and cell adhesion molecules in diverse tissues and cell types including the erythrocyte, kidney, lung and brain. Dysfunction in ankyrin-based pathways has previously been linked to abnormalities in vertebrate physiology including spherocytosis and anemia, ataxia and axonal degeneration. Recent findings have illuminated the importance of ankyrin-based pathways in excitable cells of the heart. Specifically, two ankyrin gene products, 220-kDa ankyrin-B and 190-kDa ankyrin-G, have been implicated in the targeting of structurally diverse membrane ion channels and transporters to excitable membrane domains in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, findings in humans and mice have determined the critical nature of ankyrin-based pathways for normal cardiac excitability. Reduction of ankyrin-B expression levels in mice or the presence of ankyrin-B loss-of-function mutations in humans leads to 'ankyrin-B syndrome', a cardiac disease with a spectrum of clinical presentations including bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death in response to catecholaminergic stimuli. Ankyrin-G is required for expression of the major cardiac voltage-gated Na(v) channel, Na(v)1.5, at specialized cardiac membrane domains. Human variants in SCN5A (encodes Na(v)1.5) that block Na(v)1.5 interaction with ankyrin-G lead to loss of Na(v)1.5 membrane expression and Brugada syndrome. Together, these recent findings in heart reinforce the importance of ankyrin-based pathways for normal vertebrate physiology and raise exciting new questions regarding the cellular roles for ankyrin polypeptides in cardiac and other excitable cells. While ankyrins have only been recently identified in heart, our current understanding suggests that elucidating the roles of ankyrins in organizing and targeting protein complexes to excitable membrane domains will yield important insights into the molecular basis of cardiac arrhythmias."

CD008686,0,16612477,0,Renal and extrarenal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.,"The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency of the most common clinical features in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in a sample of the Brazilian population. The medical records of 92 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease attended during the period from 1985 to 2003 were reviewed. The following data were recorded: age at diagnosis, gender, associated clinical manifestations, occurrence of stroke, age at loss of renal function (beginning of dialysis), and presence of a family history. The involvement of abdominal viscera was investigated by ultrasonography. Intracranial alterations were prospectively investigated by magnetic resonance angiography in 42 asymptomatic patients, and complemented with digital subtraction arteriography when indicated. Mean age at diagnosis was 35.1 +/- 14.9 years, and mean serum creatinine at referral was 2.4 +/- 2.8 mg/dL. The most frequent clinical manifestations during the disease were arterial hypertension (63.3%), lumbar pain (55.4%), an abdominal mass (47.8%), and urinary infection (35.8%). Loss of renal function occurred in 27 patients (mean age: 45.4 +/- 9.5 years). The liver was the second organ most frequently affected (39.1%). Stroke occurred in 7.6% of the patients. Asymptomatic intracranial aneurysm was detected in 3 patients and arachnoid cysts in 3 other patients. In conclusion, the most common clinical features were lumbar pain, arterial hypertension, abdominal mass, and urinary infection, and the most serious complications were chronic renal failure and stroke. Both intracranial aneurysms and arachnoid cysts occurred in asymptomatic patients at a frequency of 7.14%."
CD008686,0,16608504,0,Medium-term results of percutaneous vertebroplasty in multiple myeloma.,"Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are common in multiple myeloma (MM). Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is used to stabilize vertebral collapse and treat the pain. Few studies have been carried out on PVP in MM and follow-up has tended to be short. We have prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of PVP in the VCFs resulting from MM or plasmacytomas. Nineteen PVP were performed in 12 consecutive patients. We monitored their pain and functional status using visual analog (VAS) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale, respectively. For a subjective assessment, every patient was asked about his/her degree of satisfaction. The mean age of the participants was 66 yr. Significant improvement occurred 1 d after PVP according to the VAS score (7.5 pre-PVP to 3.7, P < 0.0001) and ECOG assessment (3.1 to 2.5, P = 0.002). This significant improvement was maintained after 3.2 yr of follow-up. Sixty-three percent of patients were highly satisfied with the result of the PVP and 37% were satisfied. The peri-operative mortality was 0%. Leakage of the cement outside of the vertebral body was noted in 16 of 19 injected vertebrae (84%) but none of the patients developed any clinical or neurological symptoms. At the last follow-up, no further collapse in the treated or neighboring vertebrae was noted. VCFs caused by MM or plasmacytomas can be effectively treated by vertebroplasty. PVP is associated with early clinical improvement of pain and function and can be maintained after a long follow-up without major procedure-related complications."
CD008686,0,16607930,0,Effects of 3 years of intravenous pamidronate treatment on bone markers and bone mineral density in a patient with osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG).,"We present a 21 year-old woman with osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG) suffering from bone pain and frequent long bone fractures (approximately 1 or 2 fractures/year) who was treated with i.v. pamidronate for 3 years. OPPG is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe widespread osteoporosis leading to pathological fractures and congenital or early onset blindness. Bone mineral density (BMD) (g/cm2) was determined at lumbar spine and femur neck by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. BMD studies were also performed in her parents and 18 year-old brother who were phenotypically normal. Within 2 months of the first pamidronate treatment the patient reported considerable decrease in bone pain and improved mobility. During the treatment period no important side effects and no recurrent bone fracture were reported. There were substantial increases in BMD, T score and z-score at both lumbar spine and femoral neck during therapy. Baseline lumbar spine BMD increased from 0.416 to 0.489 g/cm2 and femoral neck BMD increased from 0.455 to 0.532 g/cm2 after 3 years. Although her parents and brother did not have any history of fracture, BMD measurements revealed that her parents were osteopenic and her brother was osteoporotic. We demonstrated that pamidronate therapy seems to be safe and beneficial in both spinal and peripheral skeleton osteoporosis in patients with OPPG. Moreover, the present study clearly indicates that bone density studies and LRPS gene screening for mutations should be performed in phenotypically normal family members of patients with OPPG."

CD008686,0,16596794,0,Human studies of cannabinoids and medicinal cannabis.,"Cannabis has been known as a medicine for several thousand years across many cultures. It reached a position of prominence within Western medicine in the nineteenth century but became mired in disrepute and legal controls early in the twentieth century. Despite unremitting world-wide suppression, recreational cannabis exploded into popular culture in the 1960s and has remained easily obtainable on the black market in most countries ever since. This ready availability has allowed many thousands of patients to rediscover the apparent power of the drug to alleviate symptoms of some of the most cruel and refractory diseases known to humankind. Pioneering clinical research in the last quarter of the twentieth century has given some support to these anecdotal reports, but the methodological challenges to human research involving a pariah drug are formidable. Studies have tended to be small, imperfectly controlled, and have often incorporated unsatisfactory synthetic cannabinoid analogues or smoked herbal material of uncertain composition and irregular bioavailability. As a result, the scientific evaluation of medicinal cannabis in humans is still in its infancy. New possibilities in human research have been opened up by the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, a rapidly expanding knowledge of cannabinoid pharmacology, and a more sympathetic political environment in several countries. More and more scientists and clinicians are becoming interested in exploring the potential of cannabis-based medicines. Future targets will extend beyond symptom relief into disease modification, and already cannabinoids seem to offer particular promise in the treatment of certain inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions. This chapter will begin with an outline of the development and current status of legal controls pertaining to cannabis, following which the existing human research will be reviewed. Some key safety issues will then be considered, and the chapter will conclude with some suggestions as to future directions for human research."
CD008686,0,16586322,0,Magnetic resonance--guided musculoskeletal interventional radiology.,"As an imaging modality, magnetic resonance (MR) guidance has great potential to direct diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed in the musculoskeletal region and influence patient management. MR-guided interventional procedures involving bone, soft tissue, intervertebral discs, and joints are safe and sufficiently effective for use in clinical practice. This article discusses and illustrates the procedural characteristics and techniques when performing MR-guided musculoskeletal interventions. Biopsy procedures are similar to other modalities for bone and soft tissue lesions. MR guidance is advantageous if the lesion is not visible by other modalities and for regions adjacent to hardware and implants, subselective targeting, intra-articular locations, and periarticular cyst aspiration. MR guidance has also been used for a host of spine injections and pain management procedures such as sacroiliac joint injections, discography, transforaminal epidural injection, selective nerve block, sympathetic block, celiac plexus block, and facet joint cryotherapy neurotomies. Future directions of clinical applications include tumor ablation and multimodality procedure suites. MR-guided musculoskeletal procedures will continue to be a growth area particularly for the diagnosis and treatment of bone and soft tissue neoplasia."

CLINICAL: A 37-yr-old patient with a history of urticaria pigmentosa and an allergic reaction to a local anesthetic agent was seen in consultation at 36 weeks gestation. She previously tested negative for an allergy test to lidocaine. Recommendations to avoid systemic mastocytosis included: avoidance of histamine-releasing drugs, using lidocaine for labour epidural, and regional anesthesia in case of a Cesarean section. The patient presented at term in labour. Intravenous fentanyl was used for early labour, followed by a combined spinal-epidural. The spinal contained lidocaine and fentanyl, but because of pruritus, the epidural infusion contained lidocaine only. Most likely because of tachyphylaxis to lidocaine, an epidural bolus of lidocaine with epinephrine failed to provide adequate anesthesia for a Cesarean section. The block was supplemented with nitrous oxide by mask, with fentanyl postdelivery. Postoperative pain control was managed with an epidural infusion of lidocaine and fentanyl for three days. The patient was discharged without complications four days postsurgery."

CD008686,0,16565540,0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty: current concepts and local experience.,"With the aging population in our country, symptomatic osteoporotic compression fractures are increasingly common. Osteolytic compression fractures from spinal metastasis are also becoming more frequently seen because of the longer life expectancy from improvements in chemotherapy. Percutaneous vertebroplasty with PMMA has been shown to be an efficient procedure to treat pain due to these fractures. It is a minimally invasive procedure performed under local anesthesia and sedation. Injection of PMMA provides immediate stability when it hardens, and permits the patient to ambulate without pain. Appropriate patient selection is the key to clinical success. However, this procedure must be treated with respect, and has to be performed by physicians with the necessary training. Otherwise, increased pain, paralysis, and even death may occur from this seemingly innocuous procedure. In this article, I will deal with the background issues of osteoporotic and osteolytic vertebral compression fractures, patient selection, surgical technique, complications, and review of current literature on vertebroplasty. Key areas of development in this field include the use of kyphoplasty, defining the role of prophylactic augmentation, and improvements in biomaterials."
CD008686,0,16565537,0,Kyphoplasty: chances and limits.,"Kyphoplasty provides a minimal-invasive surgical technique for the cement augmentation of vertebral bodies following osteoprotic compression fractures or malignant processes. Kyphoplasty has been developed as an advancement of vertebroplasty. Both procedures feature high-success rates in terms of reliable and lasting reduction of pain. Advantages of kyphoplasty over vertebroplasty are to be seen in the possibility of deformity correction as well as in a decreased risk of cement leakage, which represents the most important source for clinical complications. Long-term experiences with the effect of cementing vertebral bodies are sparse. Thus indications and possibilities have to be judged realistically. Conditions, which have to be considered before performing kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty include age of the patient, age of the fracture, degree of deformation and additional degenerative changes of the spine. This article summarizes the present research and literature as well as indications and contraindications and is thought to provide guidelines for the aforementioned decision-making processes."

CD008686,0,16551916,0,The use of intrathecal morphine for postoperative pain relief after liver resection: a comparison with epidural analgesia.,"An epidural catheter is used in some institutions for postoperative analgesia after liver surgery. However, anesthesiologists may not feel comfortable leaving a catheter in the epidural space because of concern about coagulation disturbances and possible bleeding complications caused by impaired liver function. In this study, we tested a single-shot intrathecal morphine technique and compared it to a continuous epidural naropine infusion for postoperative analgesia in liver surgery. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to an epidural analgesia group (EP group; n = 25) and an intrathecal analgesia group (IN group; n = 25). The quality of analgesia assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS), the side effects, and the additional IV analgesic requirements were recorded. We did not observe any signs of cord compression. Time to first pain drug requirement was longer in the EP group compared to the IN group (25 +/- 18.5 h versus 12 +/- 10.3 h; P < 0.05). In both groups, the VAS remained less than 30 mm throughout the 48-h follow-up period. Consumption of IV morphine with a patient-controlled analgesia device in the IN group was larger (mostly from 24 to 48 h after surgery) than the EP group (12.0 +/- 5.54 mg versus 3.1 +/- 2.6 mg, respectively; P < 0.01). The incidence of vomiting was 4% in both groups, whereas the incidence of pruritus (16% versus 0%) and nausea (16% versus 4%) was more frequent in the IN group. No postdural puncture headache and no spinal hematoma occurred. After liver resection, a single dose of intrathecal morphine followed by patient-controlled morphine analgesia can provide satisfactory postoperative pain relief. The quality of this treatment, according to the VAS, is not inferior to continuous epidural analgesia up to 48 h after surgery."
CD008686,0,16550744,0,Cestode parasitic infestation: intracranial and spinal hydatid disease--a clinicopathological study of 29 cases from South India.,"In developing countries hydatidosis is both a medical and economic problem related to environmental hygiene and healthy veterinary practice. This cestode parasitic infestation, uncommonly involving the nervous system, presents with varied clinical manifestation, at times causing diagnostic dilemmas. Multiple intracranial and spinal hydatidosis is rare. A series of 29 histologically confirmed cases of hydatidosis of neuraxis (21 intracranial and 8 spinal) from South India are presented. Among the 21 cases of intracranial hydatidosis, 12 cases were in pediatric age, while only 1 spinal lesion was noted in a 5-year-old child. The clinical presentation of intracranial lesions was predominantly that of raised intracranial pressure and visual symptoms, while spinal hydatidosis manifested with severe back pain, weakness and sphincter disturbances. The cranial cysts were usually single and uniloculated (12 cases), multiple in 7 and single but multiloculated in 2. In spinal hydatidosis, the cysts are usually multiple and extradural, rare ones being intramedullary and intradural. Based on clinical features and imaging, the differential diagnosis for intracranial lesions were cystic tumors and arachnoid cyst while metastasis and tuberculosis were considered in cases of spinal hydatidosis because of vertebral bony involvement. The majority of the cysts could be surgically resected totally and some were aspirated under control suction and resected. None of the cases had anaphylactic reaction, with no significant post-operative morbidity and no mortality. One intracranial and 2 spinal lesions caused by fertile cysts recurred to undergo repeated surgery."

Assessing the efficacy of bisphosphonates in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer.","The diagnosis of bone metastases can be a devastating occurrence for any woman with breast cancer. In this setting, bone metastases can result in skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. Several trials have confirmed the ability of bisphosphonates to reduce or delay these skeletal complications, and they should now be considered standard care for these women. The analysis of SREs is the typical primary end point in bisphosphonate studies. While not undermining their importance, the definition of SREs does not include complications important to patients, such as pain and immobility. It is these symptoms that are most frequently reported by patients, and bone pain and quality of life (QoL) are often measured as secondary end points in these trials. Bone pain and QoL measures are not standardized and are difficult to compare among patient populations. We do not yet know the true efficacy of bisphosphonates as analgesics or how they impact QoL. This paper reviews the current efficacy measures used in recent bisphosphonate trials and discusses their benefits and limitations.

CD008686,0,16540454,0,Changing pattern of primary cerebral lymphoma in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era.,"Before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) represented one of the most prevalent causes of focal brain lesions in HIV-infected people. The prognosis of PCNSL was very poor, with median survival time not exceeding 2 months. Brain biopsy was the method of choice for the definitive diagnosis, but it was and remains an invasive procedure with morbidity and mortality as well as considerable costs in terms of patients' management and quality of life. The strict association between AIDS-PCNSL and Epstein-Barr virus led to the suggestion that EBV DNA in cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) might serve as a diagnostic marker, reducing the time required for diagnosis and allowing a minimally invasive approach. The clinical usefulness of this methodology has been largely demonstrated through clinical practice. After the introduction of HAART in clinical practice, a survival benefit has been observed for most persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated opportunistic infections and cancers. In particular, for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a higher likelihood of response to chemotherapy as well as a longer survival has been found as a consequence of the use of combined antiretroviral therapy. Although larger studies did not show significant changes in survival of HIV-infected patients with PCNSL in the era of HAART, small case series and anecdotal reports showed the benefit of HAART in the treatment of PCNSL. Nevertheless, these patients' survival still remains very poor and it could be hypothesized that, other than specific cancer prognostic determinants and severe immunodeficiency, viral pathogenesis as well as EBV-specific immunologic dysfunction may be responsible."

CD008686,0,19754828,0,Surgical cytoreduction for the treatment of non-lymphoid vertebral and spinal cord neoplasms in cats: retrospective evaluation of 26 cases (1990-2005).,"Medical records of 26 cats with non-lymphoid vertebral and spinal cord neoplasms treated surgically were reviewed to determine outcome and prognostic factors for survival. Of the factors examined, only tumour phenotype was significantly associated with survival. Osteosarcoma (3/26 cats) and meningioma (16/26 cats) were the most common malignant and benign tumours, respectively. The median survival time for cats with malignant neoplasms was 110.5 days, compared with 518 days for cats with benign tumours. Cytoreductive surgery resulted in clinical improvement in 25/26 cats, but local treatment failure occurred in 10/26 cats. Overall, 19/26 cats died of confirmed (12/19) or suspected (7/19) tumour-related causes, including all eight cats with malignant neoplasms. Results suggest that contemporary neurosurgical techniques commonly result in incomplete excision of feline non-lymphoid vertebral and spinal cord tumours but are efficacious at palliation of clinical signs of spinal cord dysfunction."

CD008686,0,16496149,0,Could remembering the prozone phenomenon shorten our diagnostic journey in brucellosis? A case of Brucella spondylodiscitis.,"We reviewed a case of Brucella spondylodiscitis admitted to a referral, university hospital, in Ankara, Turkey. A 75-year-old female was referred to our hospital with low back pain. Previous magnetic resonance imaging yielded cortical destruction of T9-10 and T12-L2 vertebral bodies, focal infectious foci at discs within this range, significant microabscesses at paravertebral areas, which lead to the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis. History of consumption of unpasteurized dairy products led us to first suspect brucellosis yet, the serum agglutination test and blood culture were negative and did mislead us to several other, sometimes invasive, diagnostic tests. The final diagnosis was reached by culturing the specimen obtained through fine-needle aspiration from the paravertebral microabscesses. The exhausting diagnostic journey that started with the suspicion of tuberculosis or malignancy ended with a diagnosis of brucellosis. Brucellosis should be considered in all patients with osteoarthritic complaints in endemic regions, and the ""prozone phenomenon"" should be kept in mind, before proceeding to high-tech lab tests, imaging, or invasive procedures."
CD008686,0,16494155,0,An unusual presentation of a pituitary tumour in the early postpartum period.,"The case of a parturient, who first presented with a partial oculomotor nerve palsy shortly after caesarean delivery while participating in a clinical trial, is presented. The anaesthesia for the caesarean delivery involved a combined spinal-epidural with intrathecal bupivacaine and postoperative epidural pethidine patient-controlled analgesia. The trial was examining the possible effects of magnesium infusions on acute and chronic pain. The partial oculomotor nerve palsy was an unusual presentation and the signs and symptoms were transient. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of a presumed pituitary macroadenoma. Possible reasons for the timing of onset and the rapid resolution of symptoms, and the implications and management of pituitary pathology in the peripartum period, are considered. The uncomplicated course of a later caesarean delivery in the same patient, using the same anaesthesia technique, is also noted."
CD008686,0,16489657,0,Retention mucocele of distal viable remnant tip of appendix: an unusually rare late surgical complication following incomplete appendectomy.,"A 67-year old man was presented with a 6-mo history of recurrent right lower quadrant abdominal pain. On physical examination, a vague mass was palpable in the right lumbar region. His routine laboratory tests were normal. Ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic lesion in the right lumbar region anterior to the right kidney with internal echoes and fluid components. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) showed a well-defined hypodense cystic mass lesion lateral to the ascending colon/caecum, not communicating with the lumen of colon/caecum. After complete open excision of the cystic mass lesion, gross pathologic examination revealed a turgid cystic dilatation of appendiceal remnant filled with the mucinous material. On histopathological examination, mucinous cyst adenoma of appendix was confirmed. We report this rare unusual late complication of mucocele formation in the distal viable appendiceal remnant, which was leftover following incomplete retrograde appendectomy. This unusual complication is not described in the literature and we report it in order to highlight the fact that a high index of clinical and radiological suspicion is essential for the diagnosis of mucocele arising from a distal viable appendiceal remnant in a patient who has already undergone appendectomy presenting with recurrent abdominal pain."

CD008686,0,16463199,0,Misleading history of pain location in 51 patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures.,"The aim of this study was to investigate associations between the location of osteoporotic vertebral fractures and the patient's localization of pain. Fifty-one consecutive patients (m 6, f 45; average age 74.8 years) with diagnosed osteoporotic vertebral fractures between T8 and L2 were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were fractures above T8 and below L2, spondylolisthesis, disc herniations, tumors, infections, and instability. Pain location was assessed by pain drawing, subdivided into thoracic, lumbar, and thoracic plus lumbar pain areas, and pain intensity using a 101 numeric rating scale. Furthermore, the onset of back pain and the lack or the indication of a trigger event at the onset of pain were documented. Only four of 20 patients with thoracic fractures reported thoracic pain, while the other 16 (80%) reported only lumbar pain. The location of the fracture and the patient's pain report were not related (Cohens Kappa=0.046; P=0.438). Patients with thoracic or lumbar osteoporotic fractures report pain mainly in the lumbosacrogluteal area. Therefore, the complaint of low back pain (LBP) in persons at risk for osteoporotic fractures may require both thoracic and lumbar X-rays. LBP patients with a suspect history of an osteoporotic vertebral fracture should also be given an X-ray of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Patients with a thoracic vertebral fracture had more severe pain than patients with a lumbar vertebral fracture. Onset not related to a fall or a false movement related to a significantly longer pain duration."

CD008686,0,16440202,0,Spinal lumbar synovial cysts. Diagnosis and management challenge.,"Sophisticated and newer imaging capabilities have resulted in increased reporting and treatment options of spinal lumbar synovial cysts (LSS). Most of the patients with lumbar cysts tend to be in their sixth decade of life with a slight female predominance. The incidence of LSS is thought to be less than 0.5% of the general symptomatic population. They may be asymptomatic and found incidentally or the epidural growth of cysts into the spinal canal can cause compression of neural structures and hence associated clinical symptoms. Most of the symptomatic LSS patients present with radicular pain and neurological deficits. Spinal synovial cysts are commonly found at L4-5 level, the site of maximum mobility. They may be unilateral or bilateral and at one or multilevel. MRI is considered the tool of choice for its diagnosis. The etiology of LSS is still unclear, but underlying spinal instability, facet joint arthropathy and degenerative spondylolisthesis has a strong association for worsening symptoms and formation of spinal cysts. Synovial cysts resistant to conservative therapy should be treated surgically. Resection and decompression with or without fusion and instrumentation remains an appropriate option. Synovial cysts may recur following surgery. The optimal approach for patients with juxtafacet LSS remains unclear. The best surgical treatment option for each particular individual should be tailored depending upon the symptoms, radiological findings and other co morbidities."

This audit reports data collected retrospectively over a period of 12 months on patients with MSCC referred to the West of Scotland Cancer Centre (n = 174). It was carried out to build on the work of the Clinical Resource and Audit Group (CRAG) and to examine current practice for symptom assessment, multiprofessional care and rehabilitation of patients with MSCC admitted to the cancer centre. Areas of concern include poor assessment of pain, the poor ambulatory status of patients on admission and the lack of clear plans for mobilisation and rehabilitation for the majority of patients. Recommendations include the development of regional guidelines for referral, treatment and rehabilitation, and the development of a pathway of care for use in all care settings across the region, together with improvements for use in patient information, staff education, audit and research. These are now being taken forward through the West of Scotland Cancer Network with dedicated funding from Macmillan Cancer Relief."
CD008686,0,16431012,0,Natural history and treatment of bone complications in prostate cancer.,"Bone metastases are highly prevalent in patients with prostate cancer, and they commonly present a therapeutic challenge. The natural history of prostatic bone metastases is characterized by skeletal morbidity, often producing distressing symptoms for individual patients and reducing patient autonomy and mobility. These bone metastases are usually radiologically osteoblastic, but there is also a strong osteolytic component as evidenced by marked increases in bone resorption markers. Malignant bone lesions can reduce the structural integrity of the skeleton, resulting in skeletal complications such as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, and severe bone pain, which adversely affect quality of life. Preclinical and clinical studies have provided insight into the pathophysiology of malignant bone disease from prostate cancer and suggest that bone-directed therapies, including radionuclides, endothelin-1 antagonists, and bisphosphonates, may provide both palliative and therapeutic benefits. Clinical investigations with these agents are underway in patients with prostate cancer to gain insight into the pathophysiology of bone metastases and to evaluate the role of bone-specific therapies in treating and preventing bone metastases."

CD008686,0,16391875,0,Radiofrequency ablation in palliative supportive care: early clinical experience.,"We report our early experience with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in palliative supportive care. The medical files of eight patients were retrospectively reviewed. Four patients had a renal tumor, and nephrectomy was contraindicated in each patient since they had a poor general status. The fifth patient had a local recurrence in the site of a previous nephrectomy with a pancreatic tail extension, and surgical resection was contraindicated because of abdominal carcinomatosis. Two other patients had bone metastasis, one with a painful metastasis of mammary carcinoma in the head of the humerus resistant to radiotherapy, and the other with metastasis of the tibia of cutaneous melanoma. The last patient had a local recurrence of a sacral chordoma. Management, outcomes and complications were evaluated with 13.1+/-0.3 months follow-up. All five patients with renal carcinomas did not have local recurrence. The two patients treated for bone metastases had no pain 8 weeks after RFA and remained stable over time. One complication occurred 2 months after using the procedure to treat the chordoma, and this patient was hospitalized for a fistula between the sigmoid and hypogastric artery false aneurysm and subsequently died. In conclusion, RFA can be a safe and useful adjuvant treatment in supportive care or unresponsive cancer pain patients. However, the destruction of tumoral tissues in contact with sensitive structures using RFA should be done with caution due to potentially severe complications."

We reviewed 500 patients on whom percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was performed, at 612 levels in terms of patient selection, operation technique, medication, and clinical outcomes during the follow-up course for 2 yr study period. To confirm the most painful level among the multiple fracture sites, physical examination after facet joint block under the fluoroscope was the most reliable method. The mean total lumbar spine fracture threshold of bone mineral density was 0.81+/-0.05 g/cm2. The mean changes of numeric rating scale scores, Oswestry Disability Index except sex life, and Karnofsky performance status were -72.00, -83.50 and +60.62% in the osteoporosis group and -51.89, -45.02, and 69.03% in the tumor group. Complications related to the procedure were lateral spinal cord damage, transient paresthesia and transient hypotension.

This phenomenon has never been described in this context and the treatment is quite difficult, as patients already demonstrated a poor response to systemic opioids. We report a preliminary experience of alternative methods, including the intrathecal injection of local anesthetic boluses as needed, or alternatively, the use of sublingual ketamine. Twelve consecutive patients with advanced cancer and pain were selected for intrathecal treatment after receiving different trials with systemic opioids. During intrathecal therapy, pain flares not responding to high doses of intravenous morphine were treated with intrathecal boluses of local anesthetics titrated to achieve the best balance between analgesia and adverse effects, or with sublingual ketamine (25 mg), according to their preference. Pain and symptoms were recorded for each episode of breakthrough pain during hospital admission. Effective pain control was achieved in all the episodes treated within 10 minutes with either method, without relevant complications. A mean volume of 0.6 mL of levobupivacaine (LB) 0.25% (1.5 mg) was effective within a few minutes and was well tolerated in patients receiving a continuous intrathecal infusion of a combination of morphine and LB in different doses. Similarly, ketamine in doses of 25 mg sublingually was effective and relatively well tolerated. Despite the difficult clinical situation of these patients, these approaches controlled almost all breakthrough pain events previously unresponsive to relatively high doses of intravenous opioids. These intensive treatments should be reserved for a very selected population and initiated in an appropriate setting with frequent monitoring facilities and skilled nursing."
CD008686,0,16306848,0,Dorsal extradural thoracic disc fragment: a diagnostic challenge.,"Dorsal epidural migration of an extruded disc fragment is an infrequent event, especially in the thoracic spine. An uncommon case involving a 55-year-old man is presented, with a 1-month history of paraparesis and thoracolumbar pain. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a dorsally located, extramedullary mass at the T10-T11 intervertebral level. The lesion was suspected to be a tumor. The patient underwent a T10-T11 laminectomy. Intraoperatively, an encapsulated mass of soft tissue adherent to the dural sac was found. The pathologic diagnosis was inflammatory tissue and disc material. Six months after the operation, the patient remained asymptomatic, and radiologic control showed no residual mass. Although rare, a sequestered disc fragment should be included in the differential diagnosis of an enhancing posterior extramedullary thoracic mass. Preoperative diagnosis of such pathology is difficult because the clinical signs and radiologic images may not entirely exclude other more common thoracic spinal lesions, especially tumors."
CD008686,0,16306845,0,Late paraplegia after scoliosis treatment: an uncommon diagnosis.,"We report the case of a young girl treated at age 16 for a progressive scoliosis by posterior instrumented arthrodesis. Ten years later, she suddenly developed lumbar pain and paraplegia. The surgical procedure showed a mass infiltrating the vertebral canal and the dural sheath following a supralaminar hook. Histology revealed a diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. The outcome was poor with a rapid and fatal extension of the tumor. There is nothing to justify a causal link between the scoliosis and the late onset of a malignant tumor. Nevertheless, we discuss the potential role of diagnostic irradiation consecutive to scoliosis monitoring during growth and the potential role of environmental carcinogens like metallic biomaterials. Finally, rapid intrusion of this extraspinal tumor into the dural sheath resulted in a confusing clinical picture and delayed the diagnosis and treatment of the tumor."
CD008686,0,16302636,0,Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the spine. Report of two cases.,"Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EH) is a rare tumor of vascular origin. The authors describe two cases of spinal EH, one involving the T-10 vertebra and the second involving the upper cervical spine. In the first case the patient underwent resection of the tumor; this case represents the longest reported follow-up period for spinal EH. In the second case, extensive involvement of C-2, C-3, and C-4 as well as encasement of both vertebral arteries precluded safe tumor resection, and posterior occipitocervical stabilization was performed. The patient subsequently died of metastatic disease. The findings in these two cases underscore the difficulty in predicting the clinical behavior of spinal EH based solely on histological and clinical features as well as the uncertainty of the roles of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy in the oncological management of a spinal tumor for which clinical data are very limited."

A 65-yr-old male presented with a 2-d history of rapidly enlarging neck mass and back pain. Physical examination revealed a large, hard thyroid mass and resting tachycardia. He did not have any symptoms suggestive of airway compression at presentation. Thyroid hormone levels were consistent with a hyperthyroid state. CT scan of the neck and thorax showed a heterogeneous mass replacing the thyroid, bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a metastasis with pathological fracture at the level of T-8. Technetium-pertechnetate scan failed to show any uptake in the region of the thyroid. Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid revealed anaplastic thyroid cancer. The patient was started on steroids and radiation therapy of his spine lesion. Brief surgical exploration of the thyroid revealed extensive local infiltration of adjacent neck tissues and marked tumor necrosis. Immunohistochemical stains of the tumor were positive for p53, thyroglobulin, and thyroid transcription factor-1. The tumor had an extremely aggressive course and the patient died of asphyxiation from severe airway compromise 11 d after his initial presentation."

CD008686,0,16284695,0,Evaluation of treatment results and toxicity in cases of repeated radiation therapy of spinal metastasis.,"The study evaluates retrospective results and toxicity in repeated radiation therapy in patients with recurrent pain caused by backbone metastasis, having undergone previous radiotherapy in the same body region. Fifty-seven patients were analyzed: 24 women and 33 men, aged 45-74 years (median = 59 years). They underwent a second radiation therapy treatment of the spinal column, between March 2002 and May 2004, performed due to recurrent pain in the previously irradiated region. The radiation used cobalt isotope 60 ((60)Co), to include the metastatically changed vertebrae and the margin of the adjusting healthy upper and lower vertebra. The radiated skin area measured 84-104 cm(2). Patients were divided into 3 groups depending on their treatment schemas: 12 patients -- first course of radiotherapy 4 Gy x 5, second 4 Gy x 5; 16 patients -- first course of radiotherapy 4 Gy x 5, second 8 Gy x 1; 29 patients -- first course of radiotherapy 8 Gy x 1, second 8 Gy x 1. The time delay between the first and the second radiation therapies was between 11 and 766 days (median = 135 days). An analgesic effect was achieved with most treated patients -- 41/57 (71.9%) with the use of second radiotherapy and with an insignificant percentage of complications, unimportant from the clinical point of view. No serious complications such as paralysis, paresis, spinal cord necrosis, neurological dysfunction of urethral or sigmoidorectal sphincters were noted in any of the treated patients. Based on our experience, this retrospective analysis shows usefulness of the second radiotherapy treatment as a safe method of palliative treatment in cases of painful bone metastasis appearing after a previous radiation therapy."

CD008686,0,16256833,0,History of neurosurgery and neurosurgical applications in Turkey.,"Although there is evidence of applications of cranial surgery in ancient times, it is commonly accepted that modern surgery started in the late 19th century. The advancements in anesthesiology and aseptic techniques were the main factors contributing to this process. Surgery of the nervous system, however, has a relatively shorter history than surgery of other systems. The process of surgical development in Turkey did not differ from most Western countries. Modern surgery started in 1890 in Turkey. In the beginning, neurosurgical applications were performed by general surgeons. Most of these applications included procedures for craniocerebral traumas and infections and procedures for pain relief. The first neurosurgeon, Dr. Tuner, started working in 1923, operating in some spinal cord and brain tumor and trigeminal neuralgia cases. Other neurosurgeons, Dr. Dilek, Dr. Baydur, and Dr. Kankat, were trained in France and started to work in the mid 1930s. The first neurosurgery department was established in Istanbul in 1923, and the first neurosurgery training program started in the late 1940s. Today, there are more than 50 neurosurgery training centers and more than 500 neurosurgeons in Turkey. There is an increasing number of publications by Turkish neurosurgeons, contributing to the total body of literature in neurosurgery. The current state of neurosurgery in Turkey is parallel to that of the advanced Western countries."

CD008686,0,16248278,0,Intrathecal gene transfer by adeno-associated virus for pain.,"Chronic pain is among the most prevalent medical problems, affecting more than half of patients with advanced cancer and many with other common diseases. Current analgesics often fail to provide satisfactory symptom relief and frequently cause severe side effects. Intrathecal (IT) gene transfer is an attractive method for pain research in rodent models, because it allows targeting of a wide variety of secretable peptides and proteins to the spinal cord, an important neural center for the processing of nociceptive signals. The potential of IT gene transfer for improving opioid therapy and for validating new analgesic targets, such as cytokines involved in spinal glial activation, is discussed. The IT space has been notoriously resistant to efficient gene transfer, limiting therapeutic gene expression to less than 2 weeks with most vector systems. Recent progress with adeno-associated virus (AAV) technology allowed efficient long-term gene expression, facilitating studies reflective of the chronic nature of many pain states. AAV is one of the most advanced gene therapy vectors currently undergoing clinical trials for a variety of disorders. In patients, AAV vectors could be administered intrathecally by a lumbar puncture, a safe procedure routinely performed at the bedside. AAV vectors may therefore become an important tool for translational studies to validate newly identified therapeutic targets in clinical pain states."

This article describes the role that intrathecal analgesia may play in improving comfort for individuals experiencing refractory pain and/or symptoms of opioid therapy. Patient selection, staff education, institution requirements, medications, and titration guidelines also will be reviewed. Patients with cancer clearly deserve to achieve comfort; therefore, intrathecal therapy, which is a safe intervention, must be considered when refractory pain or symptoms occur."
CD008686,0,16227733,0,[Basic studies on cancer pain control].,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for patients with moderate or severe pain, morphine has been used as a ""gold standard"" treatment for cancer pain. Recent clinical experiences have demonstrated that when morphine is used to control pain in cancer patients, psychological dependence is not a major concern. However, undue anxiety about psychological dependence on morphine in cancer patients has caused physicians and patients to use inadequate doses of opioids. In basic research, we reported that the morphine-induced rewarding effects can be dramatically suppressed under a neuropathic pain-like state induced by sciatic nerve ligation and an inflammatory pain-like state produced by intraplantar injection of formalin or carrageenan in rodents. The use of morphine for the treatment of pain is sometimes accompanied with side effects such as emesis, constipation and drowsiness. We show that the lower doses of morphine produce emesis, whereas antinociceptive doses of morphine show no emetic responses in ferrets. These findings provide further evidence that an adequate dose of morphine is useful and safe in a clinical setting."
CD008686,0,16224110,0,Tumors and tumor-like conditions of the spine in children.,"Tumors and tumor-like conditions of the spine, although rare, should be included in the differential diagnosis of infants and children with back pain. Skeletal pathology is more frequently the cause of back pain in children than in adults. Although most tumors and tumor-like conditions of the spine in children are benign, many require surgery. Children with malignant tumors of the spine (with the exception of leukemia and lymphoma) may require multimodality therapy, including surgery, to achieve long-term cure. Advances in imaging, surgical technique, surgical technology, and adjuvant therapy have led to improvements in diagnosis and treatment and, thus, outcomes. In many cases, however, early and accurate diagnosis is often possible based on only clinical history, physical examination, and plain radiographic imaging."
CD008686,0,16222314,0,Cisplatin-incorporating polymeric micelles (NC-6004) can reduce nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity of cisplatin in rats.,"In spite of the clinical usefulness of cisplatin (CDDP), there are many occasions in which it is difficult to continue the administration of CDDP due to its nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. We examined the incorporation of CDDP into polymeric micelles to see if this allowed the resolution of these disadvantages. Cisplatin was incorporated into polymeric micelles through the polymer-metal complex formation between polyethylene glycol poly(glutamic acid) block copolymers and CDDP (NC-6004). The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity studies of CDDP and NC-6004 were conducted in rats or mice. The particle size of NC-6004 was approximately 30 nm, with a narrow size distribution. In rats, the area under the curve and total body clearance values for NC-6004 were 65-fold and one-nineteenth the values for CDDP (P<0.001 and 0.01, respectively). In MKN-45-implanted mice, NC-6004 tended to show antitumour activity, which was comparable to or greater than that of CDDP. Histopathological and biochemical studies revealed that NC-6004 significantly inhibited the nephrotoxicity of CDDP. On the other hand, blood biochemistry revealed transient hepatotoxicity on day 7 after the administration of NC-6004. Furthermore, rats given CDDP showed a significant delay (P<0.05) in sensory nerve conduction velocity in their hind paws as compared with rats given NC-6004. Electron microscopy in rats given CDDP indicated the degeneration of the sciatic nerve, but these findings were not seen in rats given NC-6004. These results were presumably attributable to the significantly reduced accumulation of platinum in nerve tissue when NC-6004 was administered (P<0.05). NC-6004 preserved the antitumour activity of CDDP and reduced its nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, which would therefore seem to suggest that NC-6004 could allow the long-term administration of CDDP where caution against hepatic dysfunction must be exercised."
CD008686,0,16216003,0,Single-fraction radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal breast metastases.,The spine is the most common site of bony metastases in patients with osseous breast carcinoma metastases. Spine metastases are the source of significant pain and occasionally neurologic deficit in this patient population.

CD008686,0,16215302,0,Is paradoxical pain induced by sustained opioid exposure an underlying mechanism of opioid antinociceptive tolerance?,"Opiates are the primary treatment for pain management in cancer patients reporting moderate to severe pain, and are being increasingly used for non-cancer chronic pain. However, prolonged administration of opiates is associated with significant problems including the development of antinociceptive tolerance, wherein higher doses of the drug are required over time to elicit the same amount of analgesia. High doses of opiates result in serious side effects such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, somnolence, and impairment of mental alertness. In addition, sustained exposure to morphine has been shown to result in paradoxical pain in regions unaffected by the initial pain complaint, and which may also result in dose escalation, i.e. 'analgesic tolerance'. A concept that has been gaining considerable experimental validation is that prolonged use of opioids elicits paradoxical, abnormal pain. This enhanced pain state requires additional opioids to maintain a constant level of antinociception, and consequently may be interpreted as antinociceptive tolerance. Many substances have been shown to block or reverse antinociceptive tolerance. A non-inclusive list of examples of substances reported to block or reverse opioid antinociceptive tolerance include: substance P receptor (NK-1) antagonists, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, protein kinase C inhibitors, competitive and non-competitive antagonists of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4 isoxazolepropionic acid) antagonists, anti-dynorphin antiserum, and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists. Without exception, these substances are also antagonists of pain-enhancing agents. Prolonged opiate administration indeed induces upregulation of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) within sensory fibers in vivo, and this is accompanied by an enhanced release of excitatory neurotransmitters and neuropeptides from primary afferent fibers upon stimulation. The enhanced evoked release of neuropeptides is correlated with the onset of abnormal pain states and opioid antinociceptive tolerance. Importantly, the descending pain modulatory pathway from the brainstem rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) via the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) is critical for maintaining the changes observed in the spinal cord, abnormal pain states and antinociceptive tolerance, because animals with lesion of the DLF did not show enhanced evoked neuropeptide release, or develop abnormal pain or antinociceptive tolerance upon sustained exposure to opiates. Microinjection of either lidocaine or a CCK antagonist into the RVM blocked both thermal and touch hypersensitivity as well as antinociceptive tolerance. Thus, prolonged opioid exposure enhances a descending pain facilitatory pathway from the RVM that is mediated at least in part by CCK activity and is essential for the maintenance of antinociceptive tolerance."
CD008686,0,16213089,0,"A cannabinoid agonist, WIN 55,212-2, reduces neuropathic nociception induced by paclitaxel in rats.","Paclitaxel is an effective antineoplastic drug treatment used as an anti-tumoral therapy. Unfortunately its use is associated with unwanted side effects, which include the development of peripheral neuropathies and neuropathic pain, greatly affecting the quality of life of patients. It is well known that agonists of the cannabinoid receptor are able to reduce hyperalgesia and allodynia that develop after nerve injury. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 to reduce the thermal hyperalgesia and the tactile allodynia induced by administration of paclitaxel in rats. Present results demonstrate that WIN 55,212-2 (1 mg/kg i.p.) significantly reduced the heat (P<0.0001) and the mechanical (P=0.0003) withdrawal thresholds, the dose being smaller than that required to reach similar effects in the sciatic nerve constriction model (1.5 mg/kg). When the cannabinoid tetrad test was evaluated to measure behavioral modifications, it was found that WIN 55,212-2 (1mg/kg) did not induce changes either in body temperature or in immobility time, and only a reduction in spontaneous motility was recorded. This effect was antagonized by SR 141716A, suggesting the involvement of the CB1 receptor, although the participation of CB2 receptors cannot be excluded from this study. When WIN 55,212-2 was administered intraplantar, no differences were observed between the injected paw and the contralateral paw, suggesting that systemic mechanisms are needed to reach effectiveness. From these results we suggest that cannabinoids may be an interesting alternative to reduce neuropathic symptoms induced by paclitaxel, however more work is required to assess this possibility."

Oral administration of alendronate in addition to vitamin D3 led to remarkable improvement within 2 years, not only in clinical symptoms, such as radial bone fractures and lumbar pain, but also in parameters for osteopenia, including decreased bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (P<0.01), decreased concentrations of calcium (P<0.05), increased urine levels of deoxypyridinoline (P<0.01), increased serum levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P<0.01), increased serum levels of osteocalcin (P<0.01), and increased serum levels of intact parathyroid hormone (P<0.05), although body weight did not alter. These results suggest that bisphosphonate may improve osteopenia after gastrectomy/gastric bypass."

Povidone-iodine solution can be used to disinfect surgical wounds. Although povidone-iodine is a good broad-spectrum disinfecting agent, it has occasionally been reported to have a negative effect on wound healing and bone union. Therefore, its safety in a spinal surgery is unclear. A prospective, single-blinded, randomized study was accordingly conducted to evaluate the safety of povidone-iodine solution in spinal surgeries. Ascertained herein was the effect of wound irrigation with diluted povidone-iodine solution on wound healing, infection rate, fusion status and clinical outcome of spinal surgeries."
CD008686,0,16132526,0,Giant nondural-based cauda equina meningioma with multiple cysts.,"A very rare case of a giant nondural-based cauda equina meningioma with multiple cysts was presented. Spinal meningioma most commonly occurs in the thoracic or cervical region and typically adheres to the dura. Only six cases of nondural-based meningioma have been reported in English literature. All occurred in the cauda equina region. These patients were predominantly female and younger than those with typical intraspinal meningioma.A 46-year-old woman had a 4-year history of lower back pain and right leg pain. Progressive weakness of both lower extremities occurred. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a giant cauda equina tumor with multiple cysts from T(12) to L(4). Following laminectomies from T(11) to L(5) and intradural exposure, the tumor was found to be draped loosely by the roots of the cauda equina and attached to a root without any firm connection with dura mater. Complete removal of the tumor was achieved after microdissection of arachnoid and sacrifice of an involved rootlet of the cauda equina. The appearance of tumor was that of a typical neurilemmoma. However, histological and immunohistochemical analyses were consistent with meningioma. Nondural-based intraspinal meningiomas are very rare, particularly a giant tumor with multiple cysts as our presenting case. All of the cases previously reported, including our case, have been located in the cauda equina region. Most of the patients were female and were young, suggesting that the nondural-based cauda equina meningiomas are age- and sex-related. An accurate preoperative and operative diagnosis are difficult. Care must be taken in the management of cauda equina tumors resembling neurilemmoma which may in fact represent meningioma, particularly in the younger female."
CD008686,0,16132395,0,A simplified method of opacifying and mixing acrylic cement for percutaneous vertebroplasty: a clinical and in vitro study.,"The objective of this study was to simplify the opacifying mixing process of the bone cement and contrast used for percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). We performed a biomechanical study of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) (Corinplast 3) using three different mixtures of PMMA, monomer, and contrast: group I, 2:1; group II, 3:2; group III, 3:2:1 ratio of powder/monomer/iodinated contrast (Omnipaque). In vitro biomechanical testing of ultimate compressive strength was carried out in all samples. Following the conclusion of a proper bone cement mixture regimen drawn from the in vitro study, PVP was performed in 125 patients: 58 with cancer, 12 with hemangioma, and 54 with osteoporotic fracture. The ultimate compressive strength in group III was decreased by 38% compared to groups II and I. Proper fluoroscopic visualization was achieved in all PVP procedures using this mixture. There were no major complications associated with injection of the cement mixture. Complete (CR) and partial response (PR) was obtained in 64% and 32.8%, respectively. No further vertebral collapse occurred during follow-up. The regimen using iodinated contrast for cement visualization during PVP provides a simple and convenient new method for mixing. Although the biomechanical strength is altered by the contrast medium added, it seems insignificant in clinical practice based on the authors' limited experience."

CD008686,0,16117470,0,[Non-traumatic acute transverse spinal cord syndromes].,"Differential diagnosis of non-traumatic, acute transverse spinal cord syndromes should cover compressive myelopathy (mostly hematomas or tumors), inflammatory myelitis and vascular myelopathies. Since acute pathologies of the spinal cord primarily result in flaccid para- or tetraparesis accompanied by areflexia or hyporeflexia (spinal shock), acute polyradiculoneuritis and the cauda equina syndrome must also be weighed into the differential diagnosis. Paraplegia may ultimately also be of psychogenic origin. The clinical picture is characterized by the rapidity of progression, the possible involvement of pain, and the specific pattern of the deficits. When the latter occurs, localization of the rostrocaudal level and transverse spread are crucial factors. Depending on the affected structure, one differentiates between anterior spinal cord syndromes (anterior spinal artery syndrome, selective involvement of the anterior horn, centromedullary syndromes), long pathway syndrome (isolated in the posterior bundle or combined with pyramidal pathways) and the unilateral Brown-Séquard's syndrome. Infectious myelitis is usually caused by neurotropic viruses or mycoplasmata in conjunction with meningitis or encephalitis; these in turn either induce transverse myelitis accompanied by severe sensomotor deficits or chiefly affect the gray matter, then producing a pattern similar to anterior spinal artery syndrome. In the case of non-infectious inflammatory myelitis, one must differentiate between multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), idiopathic transverse myelitis and that of the neuromyelitis optica or Devic's disease. Symptomatic transverse myelitis can also be present in association with connective tissue diseases (e.g. SLE, Behçet's disease, Sjögren's syndrome) or sarcoidosis. Notably, when ischemic spinal infarcts are involved, their onset is frequently painful and their manifestation typically subacute, rather than apoplectiform."

CD008686,0,16102818,0,Anterior spinal column augmentation with injectable bone cements.,"A vertebral fracture, whether originating from osteoporosis or trauma, can be the cause of pain, disability, deformation and neurological deficit. The treatment of vertebral compression fractures has, for many years until the advent of vertebroplasty, consisted of bedrest and analgesics. Vertebroplasty is a percutaneous technique during which bone cement is injected in a vertebral body to provide immediate pain relief by stabilization. Inflatable bone tamps can, prior to the injection of cement, be used to create a void in the vertebral body, in which case the technique is known as balloon vertebroplasty (or kyphoplasty). The chance of extracorporal cement leakage is smaller for balloon vertebroplasty than for vertebroplasty. Some authors also claim to have gained some correction in vertebral body height or angulation. Both interventions can be used for several indications, including osteoporotic compression fractures and osteolytic lesions of the vertebral body such as myeloma, hemangioma or metastasis, and also for traumatic burst fractures in combination with pedicle screw instrumentation. Polymethyl methacrylate cement is the bone void filler that is used most frequently, although the application of calcium phosphate cements has been studied widely in vitro, in vivo and also in small-scale clinical series. The clinical results of (balloon-) vertebroplasty are favorable with 85-95% of all patients experiencing immediate and long-lasting relief of pain. Serious complications are relatively rare but include neurological deficit and pulmonary embolism. In this paper, both vertebroplasty and balloon vertebroplasty and their respective indications, techniques and results are described in relation with the application and limitations of permanent and resorbable injectable bone cements."
CD008686,0,16100481,0,Solitary plasmacytoma of bone: an unusual cause of severe sacral pain in a young man.,"A 35-year-old man presented with insidious onset of severe sacral pain. Plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large, locally invasive mass within the sacrum. Skeletal scintigraphy showed marked hyperemia and minimal peripheral osteoblastic activity of the sacral mass. An F-18 FDG PET study was performed for further assessment and clinical staging. The mass demonstrated high glucose avidity consistent with a high-grade tumor. Histologic examination confirmed the lesion to be a plasmacytoma. Solitary plasmacytoma of bone occurs predominantly in older patients involving the axial skeleton. This case is interesting in view of the large dimension, sacral involvement, the young age of the patient, and the appearance of this lesion across multiple imaging modalities."
CD008686,0,16098665,0,Neuropathological findings after continuous intrathecal administration of S(+)-ketamine for the management of neuropathic cancer pain.,"Questions have been raised about the potential neurotoxicity of the neuraxial use of ketamine although ketamine and its active enantiomer S(+)-ketamine have been used intrathecally and epidurally (caudally) for the management of perioperative pain and in a variety of chronic pain syndromes. Clinical experience following neuraxial administration of S(+)-ketamine has been documented without reference to local central nervous system toxicity following this approach. In addition, there are no preclinical safety data regarding stability, compatibility, and neurotoxicity on intrathecal use of single S(+)-ketamine or combinations of S(+)-ketamine, morphine, bupivacaine, and clonidine. In the present case, the continuous intrathecal administration of S(+)-ketamine, in combination with morphine, bupivacaine, and clonidine resulted in adequate pain relief in a patient suffering from intractable neuropathic cancer pain. However, postmortem observation of the spinal cord and nerve roots revealed severe histological abnormalities including central chromatolysis, nerve cell shrinkage, neuronophagia, microglial upregulation, and gliosis. Based on our results, neuraxial administration of S (+)-ketamine cannot be recommended for clinical practise before a systematic study of toxicology of neuraxial S(+)-ketamine in animals or humans has been performed."
CD008686,0,16097212,0,[Acute transverse myelopathy: inflammatory or ischemic?].,"The rapid development of paraparesis or tetraparesis combined with a bilateral sensory deficit that has a clearly defined rostral border and bladder dysfunction are the principal features of acute transverse myelopathy. Acute partial transverse myelopathy is far much more frequent: its symptoms are asymmetric, sometimes unilateral, and sensory deficit may predominate. An urgent MRI is required to exclude acute spinal cord compression. Diagnosis of ischemic acute transverse myelopathy includes the following elements: sudden onset, neurologic symptoms compatible with infarction in the anterior spinal artery area (by far the most frequent location for spinal cord infarction), and presence of a specific cause of spinal cord ischemia. In all other cases where it is difficult to distinguish spinal cord infarction from myelitis, analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid is essential. Most cases of inflammatory acute transverse myelopathy can be linked to a defined cause. Multiple sclerosis is a major cause of partial acute transverse myelopathy. MRI lesions are usually small, located in the lateral or posterior part of the spinal cord. Diagnostic elements include multiple lesions of multifocal demyelination on the cerebral MRI, oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the absence of clinical or laboratory abnormalities that suggest systemic disease. Neuromyelitis optica, also known as Devic's disease, has often been considered a variant form of multiple sclerosis. Recent immunologic studies confirm the hypothesis that it is a distinct entity. Infectious transverse acute myelitis is often of viral origin. It may result from direct viral stress but more frequently follows immunologically-mediated indirect stress. This acute parainfectious myelitis, like postvaccinal myelitis, may be considered as a spinal single-focus form of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). It is important to distinguish the latter from an initial episode of multiple sclerosis, because their prognosis and treatment differ."

CD008686,0,16092602,0,Suspected spinal cord compression in cancer patients: a multidisciplinary risk assessment.,"Investigators involved in this study sought to identify independent clinical predictors of spinal cord compression (SCC) in cancer patients by analyzing a comprehensive set of potential risk factors based on the results of spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all, the investigators analyzed 136 episodes of suspected SCC among 134 cancer patients evaluated with spine MRI. Each subject was interviewed within 7 days of the spine MRI to collect accurate self-reported symptom data. Neurologic examination data were detailed by the physician examining the subject prior to the spine MRI; uniform demographic and clinical information regarding the subject's cancer history was abstracted from the medical record. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of SCC. Clinically significant SCC was defined as thecal sac compression (TSC), which occurred in 50 episodes (37%). Four independent predictors of TSC were identified and included information from the neurologic examination (abnormal neurologic examination), subject-reported symptoms (middle or upper back pain), and the oncologic history (known vertebral metastases and metastatic disease at initial diagnosis). These four predictors stratified patients experiencing episodes into subgroups with varying risks of TSC, ranging from 8% (no risk factors) to 81% (three or four risk factors). These results confirmed earlier retrospective studies indicating that the evaluation of cancer patients with suspected SCC should be based upon clinical information that includes cancer-related history, symptom data,and the presence of pertinent neurologic signs. These predictors may help clinicians to assess risk in this patient population."

CD008686,0,16053471,0,Time to diagnosis of intraspinal tumors.,"The aim of this study was to assess the time to diagnosis in patients with intraspinal tumors and to assess factors contributing to a long delay in some patients. Patients who were admitted at our hospital over a 15-year period (1986-2000) with an intraspinal (either intradural or extradural) tumor were included. Records of patients were studied for variables such as sex, age, diagnosis, date of diagnosis, initial symptoms, symptoms at diagnosis, level of tumor, original diagnosis and diagnostic technique [CT-myelography, CT-caudography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]. The median time to diagnosis of 108 patients with an intraspinal tumor was 12.3 months (range: 4 days-14.4 years). Most common initial symptoms were back and/or neck pain, pain radiating to one extremity and walking disturbances. There was no distinctive clinical pattern between intramedullary and extramedullary tumors regarding initial symptoms. At the time of diagnosis, patients presented with moderate to severe neurological deficits: weakness in one extremity in 26%, sphincter disturbance (20%) and paraparesis (12%). Improved imaging of the spinal cord by MRI did not result in earlier detection of the intraspinal tumor. The time to diagnosis is explained by non-specific and slowly progressing signs and symptoms. A high rate of clinical suspicion should be present to diagnose an intraspinal tumor at an early stage."
CD008686,0,16046173,0,Pathophysiology of disk-related sciatica. I.--Evidence supporting a chemical component.,"Sciatica in patients with disk disease was long ascribed to pressure put on the sciatic nerve root by a herniated disk. However, a role for chemical factors acting in conjunction with this mechanical insult is suggested by a number of clinical observations: disk surgery does not consistently provide pain relief, large disk herniations are not always symptomatic, severe pain may be present in patients without imaging evidence of nerve root compression, the severity of symptoms and neurological signs is not well correlated with the size of the disk herniation, and conservative therapy is often effective. Experimental studies have provided further evidence for a chemical component: disk herniations can undergo spontaneous resorption, the intervertebral disk is immunogenic, and mediators for inflammation have been identified within intervertebral disk tissue. The current pathophysiological theory incriminates proinflammatory substances secreted by the nucleus pulposus (NP). When preexisting or concomitant mechanical injury to a nerve root occurs, these substances can cause nerve root pain. Animal experiments have established that the NP can induce functional and structural nerve root abnormalities in the absence of mechanical compression and that this effect is mediated by substances located at the surface of NP cells. Methylprednisolone, diclofenac, indomethacin, doxycycline, and cyclosporine induce variable inhibition of this effect. Available information points to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as the main candidate among substances potentially responsible for nerve root pain. Therefore, trials of TNF-alpha antagonists in patients with disk-related sciatica are warranted."

CD008686,0,16043290,0,Heat and mechanical hyperalgesia in mice model of cancer pain.,"We developed a mouse model of cancer pain to investigate its underlying mechanisms. SCC-7, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) derived from C3H mice, was inoculated subcutaneously into either the plantar region or thigh in male C3H/Hej mice. Heat and mechanical sensitivity as well as spontaneous behavior were measured at the plantar surface of the ipsilateral hind paw after the inoculation. Inoculated sites were histologically examined, and the expression of capsaicin receptors (TRPV1) was examined in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) to clarify their potential contribution to pain sensitivity. Inoculation of cancer cells induced marked heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in the ipsilateral hind paw for two weeks in both plantar- and thigh-inoculation models. Signs of spontaneous pain, such as lifting, licking and flinching of the paw were also observed. However, further growth of the tumor reversed the mechanical allodynia in both plantar- and thigh-inoculation models, and heat hyperalgesia in thigh-inoculation models. Histologically, no infiltration of the tumor cells into the nerve was observed. TRPV1 immunoreactive cells increased in the L5 DRG on day 7, but returned to the control level on day 15 post-inoculation. Intraperitoneal administration of the competitive TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited hyperalgesia induced by tumor cell-inoculation in either plantar- or thigh-inoculated animals. This study indicated that inoculation of SCC resulted in spontaneous pain, heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. The altered expression of TRPV1 in the DRG may be involved in behavioral changes in this model."

Neuroimaging showed suspicious hypertrophy of the left L4-5 facet which transformed in 3 years to an expansile mass lesion that compressed the dura mater and neural structures. Primary benign bone tumors such as osteoblastoma and osteoid osteoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of back pain and the patients should be followed up carefully.
CD008686,0,16037177,0,The short-lasting analgesia and long-term antihyperalgesic effect of intrathecal clonidine in patients undergoing colonic surgery.,"In this study, we investigated the antihyperalgesic effect of clonidine after surgery. Sixty patients undergoing right colic resection were studied. Patients were randomized to receive prior to general anesthesia a 2-mL intrathecal (IT) injection of 300 microg of clonidine or saline, or 10 mg of bupivacaine. General anesthesia was achieved using a target concentration propofol infusion and monitored using bispectral index. Postoperative analgesia was provided by morphine IV given through a patient-controlled analgesia device. Postoperative analgesia was assessed by morphine requirements and visual analog scale pain scores at rest, cough, and movement during the first 72 h. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured by von Frey filaments. Patients were questioned regarding residual pain at 2 wk,1, 6, and 12 mo. The patient-controlled analgesia morphine requirements were significantly smaller in the IT clonidine group (31.5 +/- 12 versus 91 +/- 25.5 and 43 +/- 15 mg, respectively, in groups clonidine, saline, and bupivacaine: P < 0.05 at 72 postoperative hours). The area of hyperalgesia at 72 h was 3 +/- 5 cm(2) in the clonidine group versus 90 +/- 30 and 35 +/- 20 cm(2) in the saline and bupivacaine groups (P < 0.05). At 6 mo, fewer patients in the clonidine group experienced residual pain than in the saline group (0 of 20 versus 6 of 20, P < 0.05). We conclude that both intraoperative spinal clonidine and bupivacaine improve immediate postoperative analgesia. IT clonidine was, however, more potent than IT bupivacaine to reduce postoperative secondary hyperalgesia."

Multifocal overgrowth can affect various tissues causing severe functional and cosmetic disability, but intellectual and language development are mostly normal. Orthopaedic problems include macrodactyly, hindfoot deformity, limb length inequality, genu valgum and scoliosis. Usually, scoliosis does not respond to bracing, and surgical intervention may be required. Despite surgical correction, instrumentation and fusion, progression of deformity can occur. The authors describe a case with a Th7-L2 scoliosis, which completely relapsed, 20 months after posterior instrumented fusion.

CD008686,0,16026743,0,Myeloma bone disease.,"The major clinical manifestation of multiple myeloma is related to the osteolytic bone destruction. The bone disease can lead to pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, hypercalcemia, and pain. It is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. These patients frequently require radiation therapy, surgery and analgesic medications. Bisphosphonates are specific inhibitors of osteoclastic activity, and these agents have been evaluated in myeloma patients with bone disease during the past 15 years. Several large randomized trials have been conducted in myeloma patients also receiving chemotherapy. Orally administered bisphosphonates have shown little ability to slow the development of skeletal complications in these patients. In contrast, more potent intravenous monthly infusions of either pamidronate or zoledronic acid have reduced the skeletal complications among these patients and are now a mainstay of myeloma therapy.

To our knowledge, an intracranial oligodendroglioma presenting with symptoms of drop metastases in the cauda equina has never been reported. We report a case of 67-year-old woman who after 1 month of severe low back and legs pain developed symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. A spinal cord MRI showed multiple intradural nodular lesions at the level of the cauda equina, a MRI of the brain showed an intraventricular brain tumor. The histopathological diagnosis of both surgically treated lesions was anaplastic oligodendroglioma. The choices adopted in planning diagnostic and therapeutical procedures are discussed.

CD008686,0,16012123,0,Gorham's disease or massive osteolysis.,"Gorham's disease is a rare disorder characterized by proliferation of vascular channels that results in destruction and resorption of osseous matrix. Since the initial description of the disease by Gorham and colleagues (1954) and by Gorham and Stout (1955), fifty years have elapsed but still the precise etiology of Gorham's disease remains poorly understood and largely unknown. There is no evidence of a malignant, neuropathic, or infectious component involved in the causation of this disorder. The mechanism of bone resorption is unclear. The clinical presentation of Gorham's disease is variable and depends on the site of involvement. It often takes many months or years before the offending lesion is correctly diagnosed. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed to arrive at an early, accurate diagnosis. Patients with Gorham's disease may complain of dull aching pain or insidious onset of progressive weakness. In some cases, pathologic fracture often leads to its discovery. Gorham's disease is progressive in most patients; however, in some cases, the disease process is self-limiting. The clinical course is generally protracted but rarely fatal, with eventual stabilization of the affected bone being the most common sequelae. Chylous pericardial and pleural effusions may occur due to mediastinal extension of the disease process from the involved vertebra, scapula, rib or sternum, and can be life threatening. A high morbidity and mortality is seen in patients with spinal and/or visceral involvement. The medical treatment for Gorham's disease includes radiation therapy, anti-osteoclastic medications (bisphosphonates), and alpha-2b interferon. Surgical treatment options include resection of the lesion and reconstruction using bone grafts and/or prostheses. In most cases, bone grafts tend to undergo resorption and are not helpful. Surgical reconstruction and/or radiation therapy are used for management of patients who have large, symptomatic lesions with long-standing, disabling functional instability. Surgical stabilization may be required for unstable spinal lesions. Various treatment options, including pleurectomy, pleurodesis, thoracic duct ligation, radiation therapy, interferon therapy, and bleomycin, have been used for management of patients with Gorham's disease presenting with chylothorax. In general, no single treatment modality has proven effective in arresting the disease."

CD008686,0,15995441,0,Prognostic relevance of clinical symptoms in patients with spinal metastases.,"Medical and surgical advances allow surgical treatment of many patients with spinal metastases. Although emerging surgical techniques facilitate stabilization of the collapsed spine, surgical candidates should be carefully selected. However, the lack of confirmed criteria to determine survival of these patients makes selection for surgery difficult. Clinical symptoms have been considered possible factors associated with prognosis, but their relevance has not been confirmed because of inadequate power for proper statistical analysis. We retrospectively reviewed 165 patients who had surgery for spinal metastases from various cancers. Clinical symptoms including pain, paresis, and walking status were recorded. Multivariate analysis indicated that the histologic type of the primary tumor was the strongest prognostic factor, followed by preoperative paresis and pain. Myeloma, thyroid cancer, renal cell cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer had better prognoses than other kinds of cancer. Patients without paresis before surgery had a better prognosis than patients with paresis, and patients with no pain before surgery had a better prognosis than those with pain. Preoperative walking status was not an independent prognostic factor."
CD008686,0,15992459,0,Clinical benefit of zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal complications in advanced prostate cancer.,"Men with prostate cancer are at high risk of developing bone metastases that can lead to clinically significant skeletal morbidity. Recently, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial in 422 men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone metastases demonstrated that zoledronic acid (4 mg every 3 weeks) significantly reduced the incidence and onset of skeletal complications and provided significant long-term reductions in bone pain compared with placebo. Patients received zoledronic acid for a 15-month core phase, with the option to continue therapy for 9 more months on the extension phase. To evaluate the continuing benefit of long-term zoledronic acid therapy, retrospective exploratory analyses were conducted based on the incidence of skeletal-related events (SREs; defined as pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery or radiation therapy to bone, or change in antineoplastic therapy for bone pain) occurring only during the extension phase of this trial. Quality of life parameters included assessment with the Brief Pain Inventory. Similar to results reported for the 15-month core phase and the entire 24-month study, the 9-month extension phase demonstrated that zoledronic acid significantly reduced the percentage of patients with an SRE (P = 0.017), prolonged the median time to first SRE (P = 0.036), reduced the annual incidence of SREs by 52% (P = 0.016), and reduced the risk of SREs by 53% (P = 0.022) compared with placebo. Furthermore, zoledronic acid was safe and well tolerated. Therefore, zoledronic acid provides long-term continuing clinical benefit for men with prostate cancer and bone metastases and represents a new therapeutic option for this population."

Pediatric oncology patients (self-assessment) and their parents from 28 hospitals were questioned using age-adapted, structured interviews and validated pain assessment tools. Pain intensity was measured by the NRS and Bieri faces scale. We conducted 363 interviews with patients and their parents, and 46 with the parents alone (if patients <2.5 years). Pain was reported at the time of the interview or within the last 24 h, 7 d, or 4 weeks in 15%, 28%, 50% and 58% of cases, respectively. The proportion of patients suffering severe to maximal pain (NRS>3; Bieri>2) increased significantly (p=0.001, chi2 test). The median pain intensity for the most severe pain episode within the last 4 weeks was 6.7 (NRS 0-10). Adverse effects of anti-tumor therapy were the most frequent cause of pain. Multivariate analyses depicted general physical condition either ""severely reduced"" (ASA status 3) (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.1-14.7, p=0.037) or ""moderately reduced"" (ASA status 2) (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, p=0.018), ""in-patient status"" (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.9, p=0.010), and ""co-morbidity present"" (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-10.7, p=0.030) as risk factors for severe to maximal pain.

All procedures were performed under general anesthesia, and complications were prospectively recorded. Laboratory measurements included lumbar puncture opening pressure, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) chemistry, and cell count and morphology. Central venous pressure and ophthalmologic examinations were also performed. Forty-seven children underwent 247 intrathecal injections of chemotherapy. Adverse effects (13.7% of the procedures) included nausea and vomiting, back pain, and headache. One child each had transient cauda equina syndrome, transient communicating hydrocephalus, and persistent sacral plexus injury. The mean lumbar puncture opening pressure was significantly higher after intrathecal therapy than before (22 +/- 8 vs. 15 +/- 9 cm H2O, P = 0.02) and higher than reported in age-matched children without leukemia. All CSF chemistries, cell count, and morphology were normal. The overall incidence of complications was 13.7%. Most were mild and resolved quickly, but significant neurologic complications did occur.

CD008686,0,15955931,0,Diagnostic criteria for schwannomatosis.,"The neurofibromatoses are a diverse group of genetic conditions that share a predisposition to the development of tumors of the nerve sheath. Schwannomatosis is a recently recognized third major form of neurofibromatosis (NF) that causes multiple schwannomas without vestibular tumors diagnostic of NF2. Patients with schwannomatosis represent 2.4 to 5% of all patients requiring schwannoma resection and approximately one third of patients with schwannomatosis have anatomically localized disease with tumors limited to a single limb or segment of spine. Epidemiologic studies suggest that schwannomatosis is as common as NF2, but that familial occurrence is inexplicably rare. Patients with schwannomatosis overwhelmingly present with pain, and pain remains the primary clinical problem and indication for surgery. Diagnostic criteria for schwannomatosis are needed for both clinicians and researchers, but final diagnostic certainly will await the identification of the schwannomatosis locus itself."

CD008686,0,15949776,0,What diagnostic tests are useful for low back pain?,"Low back pain (LBP) is a common problem that poses some interesting and difficult diagnostic problems. It is typically benign and self-limited, but it is occasionally the presenting symptom of serious systemic disease. The general diagnostic approach to low back pain is to check for 'red flags' in the history and physical that suggest the presence of malignancy, infection or spondyloarthridites, and for neurological compromise that could indicate that surgery is required (cauda equina syndrome) or may be beneficial (such as herniated discs or spinal stenosis that have not improved with conservative care). In the absence of these features, imaging is of limited value. Recent research has begun to evaluate subgroups with 'non-specific' low back pain that seem to benefit from specific interventions such as median branch or sacroiliac joint injections, manipulation, or specific exercises, but these require further investigation and validation."

However, during infancy clinical signs are often misdiagnosed. The treatment should be aimed at protecting kidneys from severe bladder dysfunction. We report a case of a female infant with an arachnoid cyst diagnosed at the age of 6 months, who suffered from intractable, repeated febrile urinary tract infections (UTI) for the previous 3 months. The images obtained by ultrasonography and voiding cystoureterography techniques were typical of a neurogenic bladder. The spinal cord was examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed an arachnoid cyst that was surgically treated when the child was 8 months old. The postoperative results were excellent: spinal cord MRI was normal after 1 year, and the child experienced only one UTI episode in the next 2 years.

CD008686,0,15942158,0,A new technique for superior hypogastric plexus block: the posteromedian transdiscal approach.,"Superior hypogastric plexus block has been advocated for the treatment of cancer related pelvic pain. Neurolysis is usually established using the classical posterolateral approach in the prone position, in which correct placement of the needle is sometimes difficult due to vertebral anatomy and the patient's inability to lie prone. We describe an alternative posteromedian transdiscal approach under fluoroscopic guidance for the treatment of intractable pelvic pain in three patients, in whom the classical approach was not possible. The L5-S1 interdiscal space was identified with fluoroscopy. The needle was then introduced through the disc and advanced under lateral fluoroscopic control. After verifying correct needle placement, neurolysis was performed with 8 ml of 10% phenol solution. All patients had significant pain relief immediately after the block, lasting from 6 to 12 months, and their pain severity scores and opioid consumption were reduced by more than 50%. There were no complications such as discitis, disc rupture or nerve injury. Since this new posteromedian transdiscal approach provides easy access to the superior hypogastric plexus with a single puncture and with any patient position, it may be an alternative to the classical approach."

CD008686,0,15931511,0,Clinical results of an open prospective study of a bis-GMA composite in percutaneous vertebral augmentation.,"In this open prospective trial, 53 patients with acute pain from osteoporotic vertebral fracture related to osteoporosis or malignancy underwent vertebral augmentation with a new bisphenol-a-glycidyl dimethacrylate (bis-GMA) resin (Cortoss, Orthovita, Malvern, Pa, USA). Treatment consisted of up to 8 ml of Cortoss injected into a given vertebra. The procedure encompassed single and multiple injections (including the contralateral hemivertebra, to a maximum of 3 vertebral levels). Follow-up was at 4 and 8 days and at 1, 3, and 6 months. The primary efficacy end point was patient-rated pain using a 100-point visual analog scale (VAS, with 100 as severest pain) on day 4 following treatment; secondary end points were analgesic use and quality-of-life and disability scores from the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and a short-form 12-item questionnaire (SF-12). The present report contains interim results collected up to the 1-month post-treatment time point. At baseline, the group's mean VAS score was 69, indicating moderate to severe pain; at day 4, 32 of 53 patients (60.4%) reported a 30% or greater reduction in baseline pain accompanied by a VAS pain score less than 50 (mean 38.1). Pain reduction was maintained at 1 month (mean VAS 31.3). The average ODI score at baseline was 55, suggesting significant disability among participants prior to Cortoss treatment. Following treatment, the ODI scores were significantly reduced from these baseline levels (day 8, 47.4; 1 month, 33.6). Further, SF-12 physical and mental component scores at 1 month after treatment increased from baseline by 26% and 11%, respectively; while analgesic use decreased concomitantly, primarily among patients with underlying osteoporosis. A total of 20 adverse events were deemed to be device-related. The most frequent clinically significant adverse events attributed to Cortoss were leakage of Cortoss from within the vertebral body at placement (12%), back pain (7%), and unspecified pain (7%). These results indicate that vertebral augmentation with Cortoss rapidly reduces pain, decreases disability, and improves physical functioning in patients with painful vertebral compression fractures."

CD008686,0,15926084,0,Extradural spinal cavernous angiomas: report of seven cases.,"The authors describe seven cases of extradural spinal cavernous angioma. Although cavernoma itself is not rare, the extradural spinal localization is uncommon and makes preoperative differential diagnosis difficult. Routine MRI investigation has aided neurosurgeons in evaluating the true incidence of these vascular malformations, which was understimated in the past. The data published so far have not entirely clarified the treatment of choice for these lesions. Considering their rarity in this site, their presenting symptoms and the difficulties involved in neuroradiological diagnosis, the authors discuss the role of surgery as the principal form of treatment and review the relevant literature. Seven patients (4 male, 3 female) were admitted to our Institute of Neurosurgery between 1992 and 2004, with a 5-6 month history (range=2-365 days) of low back pain or radicular pain, sometimes associated with paresthesia. All patients had a CT scan, as well as MRI with gadolinium when possible, which detected an extradural roundish lesion: differential diagnosis was very difficult, especially between neurinoma and cavernoma. Treatment was always surgical and resection of the lesion radical. Postoperatively, all patients presented complete regression of clinical symptoms. In all cases histological diagnosis was cavernous angioma. Postoperative MRI with gadolinium or CT scan with IV contrast, performed before discharge, confirmed radical removal of the vascular malformation in all cases. Our experience confirms that surgery should be the treatment of choice for these lesions, in view of both their tendency to bleed and their straightforward surgical removal."

CD008686,0,15920220,0,Systemic ondansetron antagonizes the sensory block produced by intrathecal lidocaine.,"In this prospective randomized, double-blind study, we investigated the effect of ondansetron on the lidocaine subarachnoid block. Fifty-four male patients scheduled for transurethral surgery under subarachnoid anesthesia received oral ondansetron 4 mg the evening before surgery and 4 mg IV 15 min before subarachnoid anesthesia (ondansetron group) or placebo (placebo group). Two milliliters of 5% hyperbaric lidocaine was administered intrathecally. Sensory block was assessed 20, 25, and 30 min and motor block 30, 60, and 90 min after lidocaine injection. In two patients in the control group and five in the ondansetron group, sensory block was not assessed for technical reasons. In the ondansetron group, sensory block values differed significantly over the 30-min period of assessments (P = 0.048). Fifteen, 20, 25, and 30 min after subarachnoid lidocaine, the level of sensory block was at T11, T12, T12, and T12 in the control group and T12, T12, T12, and L1 in the ondansetron group and differed between groups at 30 min (P = 0.019). Motor block did not differ between the two groups at any study time. We conclude that, under the conditions of our study, ondansetron antagonizes the sensory block produced by lidocaine."

CD008686,0,15912348,0,Seventh cervical vertebral body solitary osteochondroma. Report of a case and review of the literature.,"Solitary osteochondroma of the cervical spine is a rare manifestation of a common bony tumour. It can create symptoms, depending on the adjacent compressed structures. In this report, a patient suffering solitary osteochondroma on the anterolateral aspect of the C7 vertebral body is presented and the literature is reviewed. A 46-year-old female presented with dysphagia and pain at the anterolateral surface of her neck during cervical movements or application of local pressure. The clinical and imaging assessment ascertained that the above complaints were due to a local tumour in the neck firmly attached to the spine at the anterolateral aspect of the C7 and which resembled an osteochondroma. Surgical treatment was chosen due to the persistence of the symptoms. The lump was resected using an anterolateral cervical approach and it was sent to the pathology department for confirmation of the lesion's histological character. The patient was completely relieved of her symptoms. Resection of the osteochondroma seems to be the only reliable solution for definitive relief from the clinical complaints. This surgical treatment, as it is reported, has no major complications and gives good functional results. One to four per cent of the osteochondromas are located at the spine. At the cervical spine, they can cause neurological symptoms and more rarely, dysphagia. Reviewing the literature, no case of solitary osteochondroma located in the anterior aspect of the C7 body was found. Two cases suffering from dysphagia were reported due to external compression by anterior hyperostosis of the cervical spine, but not due to osteochondroma."
CD008686,0,15904754,0,Neurotoxicity from chronic opioid therapy after successful palliative treatment for painful bone metastases.,"A 64-year-old man with severe bone pain secondary to pathological fracture of a vertebra required large doses of morphine to obtain pain relief. After receiving effective palliative anti-tumor treatment, he developed chronic opioid neurotoxicity. We postulate that the gradual reduction in pain over a period of time precipitated the development of toxicity that presented as cognitive failure. Delayed opioid toxicity is a potential consequence of effective disease-modifying therapies that needs to be recognized and treated appropriately when it occurs. The increasing use of community-based palliative care after hospitalization means that the community practitioner also needs to be aware of the development of chronic opioid toxicity at home. Optimal timing for going back down the ladder of opioid doses, after reduction of the noxious stimulus, requires clinicians to recognize different types of symptoms and signs and to consider the effect of other treatments and time on the noxious stimulus. A suggested protocol warrants consideration as a means of improving clinical practice; however, it requires prospective evaluation in the clinical setting."
CD008686,0,15903353,0,Pharmacological management of severe postmenopausal osteoporosis.,"The most devastating consequence of osteoporosis is bone fracture, particularly at the vertebral or femoral level. As defined by the WHO, patients with osteoporosis who have had one or more fragility fractures have severe osteoporosis. Those who sustain a vertebral fracture represent a particularly vulnerable group whose risk of another vertebral fracture within the following year is increased by a factor of 3-5. In addition, the presence of a vertebral fracture is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. In light of these data, treatment of established osteoporosis is extremely important to prevent other fragility fractures. This review examines the therapies approved by the US FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis that have been shown to reduce the incidence of new fractures in patients with established osteoporosis. We evaluated the mechanisms of action, available formulations, efficacy in preventing fractures and increasing bone mineral density (BMD), duration of treatment, adverse effects and contraindications to use of alendronic acid (alendronate), risedronic acid (risedronate), calcitonin, raloxifene and teriparatide. All these drugs are able to prevent new vertebral fractures in patients with established osteoporosis. Only alendronic acid and risedronic acid have also been shown to reduce the risk of fracture at the femoral level, but they are contraindicated in patients with upper gastrointestinal diseases. Calcitonin is a good option in subjects with back pain because of its analgesic effect. Raloxifene is useful when patients have high plasma lipid levels or a family history of breast cancer. Teriparatide is indicated in subjects with very low BMD and multiple vertebral fractures. Patient characteristics should determine selection of therapy but the decision is always difficult and fraught with uncertainty."

CD008686,0,15891876,0,Diffuse vertebral body edema due to calcified intraspongious disk herniation.,"We describe the case of a patient with a recent history of high back pain, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine showing intervertebral disk herniation into the spongious bone of the vertebral body of T9 that might have caused diffuse, low signal intensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery T1-weighted (FLAIR-T1W) images, high signal intensity magnetic resonance (MR) on T2-weighted (T2W) images and T2-weighted fat-suppressed images (T2W-FSIs) and marked enhancement on the vertebral body of T9 with gadolinium on T1-weighted fat-suppressed images (T1W-FSIs) images. Those findings suggested diffuse edema and might be indistinguishable from tumoral or inflammatory diseases, but the plain films and the reformatted sagittal computed tomography scans of the thoracic spine were helpful to show a calcified part of the intervertebral disk migrating into the vertebral body of T9. The patient made full recovery from the symptoms after conservative treatment and at the follow-up MRI showed normalization of the bone marrow signal intensity of the vertebral body of T9."

Seven patients underwent the procedure--five with syringomyelia, one with a symptomatic perineurial cyst, and one with a large arachnoid cyst. In all patients the shunt was successfully placed, and clinical improvement occurred in six. In four patients the entire procedure was performed endoscopically, whereas in three conversion to an open surgical exposure was required for safe access of a syrinx cavity. Overall, however, the pleural or peritoneal catheter was successfully placed endoscopically in all seven patients. There were two cases of postoperative positional headaches of which one required valve revision. In one case the catheter migrated and required repositioning.

We analyzed our experience during a consecutive series of 100 patients who had this procedure and who were available for study at 3-year followup. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was done on patients with the following diagnoses: idiopathic scoliosis (n = 49), neuromuscular spinal deformity (n = 15), Scheuermann kyphosis (n = 15), congenital and infantile scoliosis (n = 5), neurofibromatosis (n = 5), Marfan (n = 1), postradiation scoliosis (n = 1), and repair of pseudoarthrosis (n = 1). Four patients had excision of the first rib to treat thoracic outlet syndrome. One patient had excision of an intrathoracic neurofibroma and one a benign rib tumor. One had anterior arthrodesis after fracture-dislocation of the thoracic spine and another had anterior fusion for vertebral osteomyelitis. The average operative time for the thoracoscopic anterior release with discectomy and arthrodesis was 253 minutes. The average number of discs excised was 8. Final postoperative scoliosis and kyphosis corrections were 68% and 90%, respectively. Complications related to thoracoscopy occurred in eight patients.

CD008686,0,15859838,0,Radionuclide therapy for palliation of pain due to osteoblastic metastases.,"Beta-emitting, bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals, administered systemically, represent a good alternative or adjuvant to external beam radiotherapy for palliation of painful osteoblastic bone metastases. The most frequently used radiopharmaceutical for this purpose is strontium 89, followed by samarium 153 ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonate, and infrequently phosphorus 32 orthophosphate. Prior to consideration for radionuclide therapy, recent bone scans should be evaluated in order to determine if the patient has painful osteoblastic lesions likely to respond to therapy. Approximately 70% of patients with prostate and breast cancer will have a reduction in pain in response to radionuclide therapy, beginning within 2 to 4 weeks and lasting between 2 and 6 months. Patients who are expected to live 3 or more months are more likely to benefit than patients with shorter duration life expectancy. Hematosuppression is the chief side effect of radionuclide therapy, with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia more likely to be clinically significant than anemia. Relative contraindications for treatment include osteolytic lesions, pending spinal cord compression or pathologic fracture, preexisting severe myelosuppression, urinary incontinence, inability to follow radiation safety precautions, and severe renal insufficiency."

We present a case of an 87-year-old man who complained of severe low-back pain with radiation to the lower limbs and weakness of the lower limbs. The patient had had a fall on a bus 1 month before admission. The patient also had a history of colon cancer and had received a colostomy 9 years before. In this admission, lumbar spine radiographs showed compressive fractures of vertebral bodies at L1 and L3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperemic change of the L3 marrow with osteonecrosis (fluid sign). The ventral thecal sac was slightly compressed due to retropulsion of L3. The L1 marrow was normal. Bone densitometry of the calcaneous revealed osteoporosis. The patient was then treated by vertebroplasty and bilateral foraminotomy of L3 after a diagnosis of acute compressive fracture. On histology, there was a metastatic adenocarcinoma arranged in glands and nests in the bone and paraspinal soft tissue. On retrospective viewing, an axial gadolinium-enhanced MRI revealed paraspinal extension of soft tissue at L3, which is highly suggestive of metastasis in a vertebra."

The differential diagnosis is wide and ranges from rather harmless muscular distortions to systematic disease, such as chronic infections or cancer. Our case shows, that sometimes the diagnosis is not quite simple to determine. A atypically picture may lead to unnecessary further evaluations and in some case even invasive diagnostic tests. However, the benefit should overweight the harm and costs. Not every back pain needs to be examined in every case and with every diagnostic possibility. Recent guidelines recommend a conservative approach to patients with back pain if they are younger than 50 years of age and if cancer or chronic infection is not suspected from their clinical evaluation and past medical history. For patients older than 50 years of age and suspicion for systematic disease, a radiograph of the spine and a routine laboratory measurement, including markers of inflammation (e.g. C-reactive protein), alkaline phosphatase, PSA (prostate-specific antigen) and immune-electrophoresis is mandatory. More detailed diagnostic steps, e.g. CT or MRT, should be performed if symptoms persist for longer than 6 weeks.

The patients' ages ranged from 3 to 83 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. Nine cases presented as anterior mediastinal masses with chest pain, shortness of breath, and pleural effusion, and 6 cases were in paravertebral location in the posterior mediastinum and presented with neck or back pain and pleural effusion. The tumors measured from 5 to 20 cm in greatest diameter and showed a tan white, soft to rubbery cut surface with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis and foci of gelatinous material. Four cases showed areas of cystic degeneration. In 7 cases, the tumors were well circumscribed; in 6 cases, the tumors grossly invaded the pleura, pericardium, heart, great vessels, chest wall, rib, and vertebra. Histologically, 5 cases displayed a biphasic growth pattern, with well-formed glandular elements admixed with a monotonous spindle cell population. Ten cases were exclusively composed of a monotonous atypical spindle cell proliferation. Immunohistochemical studies showed focal positivity of the tumor cells for cytokeratin and/or epithelial membrane antigen, and strong positivity for vimentin and bcl-2 in the spindle cells in all cases studied (10 of 10). Eight cases also showed focal positivity for CD99. Electron microscopic examination in 5 cases showed oval to spindle tumor cells with closely apposed cell membranes, abundant cytoplasmic intermediate filaments and rough endoplasmic reticulum, and immature desmosome-type cell junctions. Ten patients were treated by complete surgical excision and two by partial excision followed by radiation therapy. In 4 patients, the tumors were inoperable and treated with radiation therapy only. Clinical follow-up was available in 5 patients and showed local recurrence with metastases to lung, lymph nodes, and epidural space from 1 to 3 years in 4 cases and liver metastases and death due to tumor after 6 month in 1 case. Synovial sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of biphasic and monophasic spindle cell neoplasms of the mediastinum."

The intravenous urography showed non-function in the left kidney harbouring a calculus. Treatment was delayed for poor finances. At laparotomy a huge renal mass invading the colonic mesentery and showing neovascularisation was removed. The final diagnosis was chronic pyonephrosis. She recovered from postoperative septicaemia. Neovascularisation is a feature of malignant disease mediated by angiogenesis factors. These factors are probably present in chronic inflammation.

Our purpose was to evaluate the technical feasibility of the cement injection at this acute phase, assess its the impact on the pain and monitor spinal stability, by quantifying potential kyphosis modification. Twelve patients with relative contraindication of the orthopaedic treatment were treated by early injection after the trauma for an A type fracture of the Magerl classification, without neurological sign. Patients surveys revealed a significant pain reduction within the first day. Half of them reduced the kyphosis angle, and the anterior height vertebral body significantly improved after the vertebroplasty. The mean reduction in the kyphosis angle was 8. No complication occurred except one extravertebral asymptomatic leak, with secondary increase of the kyphosis. Vertebroplasty performed in reduction position may allow a complete stabilization without pain and furthermore can reduce the kyphosis angle."

CD008686,0,15795927,0,Underlying mechanisms of pronociceptive consequences of prolonged morphine exposure.,"The opioid analgesics, commonly exemplified by morphine, represent the best option for the treatment of severe pain and for the management of chronic pain states, of both malignant and nonmalignant origin. It is well recognized that the prolonged use of opioids is associated with a requirement for ever-increasing doses in order to maintain pain relief at an acceptable and consistent level. This phenomenon is termed analgesic tolerance. While the concept that tolerance can develop as a result of cellular adaptations to the presence of the opioid has been proposed, it is now becoming abundantly clear that tolerance may also be related to a state of hyperalgesia that results from exposure to the opioid itself. Patients who receive long-term opioid therapy sometimes develop unexpected, abnormal pain. Similar paradoxical opioid-induced pain has been confirmed in a number of animal studies, even during the period of continuous opioid delivery. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that such pain may be secondary to neuroplastic changes that occur in the brain and spinal cord. One such change may be the activation of descending pain facilitation mechanisms arising from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) elicited in part by increased activity of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the RVM. A cascade of pronociceptive events may follow, such as opioid-induced upregulation of spinal dynorphin levels that promotes enhanced input from primary afferent nociceptors. This mechanism appears to depend on intact descending pathways from the RVM, since interrupting this pathway abolishes enhanced abnormal pain. Furthermore, extended opioid exposure also can elicit increased calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and substance P expression in the dorsal root ganglia. It is probable that increased pain elicited by opioids is a critical factor in the behavioral manifestation of opioid tolerance because the same manipulations that block abnormal pain also block antinociceptive tolerance. Taken together, such studies show that opioids elicit systems-level adaptations resulting in pain due to descending facilitation, upregulation of spinal dynorphin, and enhanced, evoked release of excitatory transmitters from primary afferents. These adaptive changes in response to sustained exposure to opioids indicate the need for the evaluation of the clinical consequences of long-term opioid administration. Additionally, these findings suggest a need for novel chemistry involving design of agents that may counteract opiate-induced neuroplastic adaptations resulting in pain relief without analgesic tolerance."

The aim of performing celiac plexus and splancnic nerve blocks was surgical anesthesia at the beginning. But because of the technical demands and variable results of celiac plexus and splanchnic nerve blocks as a surgical anesthetic, over time, these techniques were supplanted by spinal anesthesia and segmental blockade of the somatic paravertebral nerves. As celiac plexus and splanchnic nerve blocks were falling into disuse for surgical anesthesia, the clinical utility of these techniques was becoming apparent in the new specialty of pain management. Celiac plexus and splancnic nerve blocks are effective in relieving chronic abdominal pain, especially originating from the malignancies of the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, omentum, mesentery, and alimentary tract from the stomach to the transverse portion of the large colon. The relevant anatomy, indications, cotraindications, different application techniques and results of celiac blockade is reviewed in this paper."

CD008686,0,15788638,0,rhTSH-aided radioiodine ablation and treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma: a comprehensive review.,"Traditionally, withdrawal of thyroid hormone has been used to attain the increase in serum TSH concentrations that are believed to optimize the trapping and retention of radioiodine for diagnostic procedures, thyroid remnant ablation and treatment of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). However, withdrawal frequently causes clinical hypothyroidism, with resultant cognitive impairment, emotional dysfunction, physical discomfort, health risks in patients who are elderly, frail or have concomitant illness, and impaired quality of life and ability to work. Recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) was developed to provide TSH stimulation without withdrawal of thyroid hormone and the associated morbidity. rhTSH has been approved as an adjunct for diagnostic procedures in patients with DTC, but is currently an experimental aid in thyroid remnant ablation and the treatment of thyroid tumours. In the period 1997-2004, nearly 30 medical centres worldwide have reported on almost 400 patients with DTC who were given rhTSH in preparation for radioiodine ablation of thyroid remnants or treatment of local tumours of metastatic disease. We have analysed and summarized the findings reported in this literature. Ablation aided by the standard course of rhTSH, two consecutive daily injections of 0.9 mg, had success rates better than 84% in 90 patients given radioiodine activities in excess of 4000 MBq. However, when 1110 MBq was administered, success rates were 81.2% in 16 patients given the standard course of rhTSH and 4-day withdrawal of thyroid hormone around the time of radioiodine administration in one study, but 54% in 70 patients in another study. rhTSH-aided treatment of persistent or recurrent local or metastatic cancer, or both, with from one to six courses of radioiodine 1000-19055 MBq, achieved 2% complete remission, 36% partial response and 27% disease stabilization rates, for a 65% clinical benefit rate, in 115 primarily elderly, late-stage patients for whom responses were reported. Twelve of these patients died as a result of progressive disease or were discharged from hospital into hospice care. Generally, rhTSH was very well tolerated. However, in a minority of patients with central nervous system, spinal or bone metastases, or bulky thyroid remnant or neck lesions with or without poor pulmonary reserve, administration of rhTSH, like thyroid hormone withdrawal, was found to stimulate expansion of the tumour, with ensuing compression of key anatomical structures and neurological, respiratory or other clinical complications. The rapid onset, response to glucocorticoids and radiological findings of peritumoural oedema or, less commonly, haemorrhage in the published cases, strongly suggest that the tumour expansion was the result of swelling rather than growth. As in the case of thyroid hormone withdrawal, special attention and glucocorticoid premedication are thus warranted when rhTSH is given to patients known or suspected to have the above characteristics. Dosimetric data suggest that whole-body and whole-blood radioiodine clearance may be faster in euthyroid patients after administration of rhTSH. In theory, the faster clearance could allow, or demand, increased radioiodine activities when rhTSH is used, but clinical data to date suggest that this may be unnecessary. The faster clearance also might result in safety or convenience benefits with the use of rhTSH, such as decreased exposure of extrathyroid areas to radiation, and shorter hospital stays. In conclusion, in preliminary results from open-label studies, both rhTSH-aided tumour ablation and treatment have been well tolerated and have shown efficacy in substantial proportions of patients. rhTSH-aided ablation merits further study. rhTSH-aided treatment may be preferred in patients who are at greater risk of hypothyroid complications from withdrawal of thyroid hormone or are unable to produce sufficient endogenous TSH, and warrants additional investigation in younger patients at earlier stages of thyroid cancer."

CD008686,0,15764414,0,"Erectile dysfunction: anatomical parameters, etiology, diagnosis, and therapy.","Functional anatomy of the human penis involves various parameters: cavernous tissue, covering integument, prepuce foreskin, corpora cavernosa, corpus spongiosum, glans, facia, arterial supply, venous drainage, lymph drainage, musculature, and nerve supply. Several factors affect the expression/degree of erectile dysfunction (ED) endocrine profile, aging/senescence, demyelinating diseases, and surgery. Risk factors of ED are: age, vascular factors, metabolic diseases (diabetes mellitus), neurologic diseases, and HIV/AIDS. Several drugs are associated with ED: antiandrogenic, anticholinergic, antidepressants, antihypertensive, major tranquilizers, anxiolytics, and certain medicines/metabolites. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is a multidimensional scale for assessment of erectile dysfunction. The main structures mediating erection are the corpora cavernosa or ""erectile bodies,"" which are fused distally for approximately three-quarters of their length. They separate proximally to fuse with each ischial tuberosity of the pelvis. On their ventral surface lies the corpus spongiosum, which surrounds the urethra. Coital dysfunction is classified into ""erectile dysfunction"" (psychosexual and endocrine/neuro-endocrine) and ""ejaculatory dysfunction"" (psychosexual, and genitourinary surgery). Vasculogenic impotence was evaluated by high-resolution ultrasonography and pulsed Doppler spectrum analysis. Cavernosal, alpha-blockade is a technique used to evaluate and treat ED. Another diagnostic procedure for ED involves color floro and spectural Doppler imaging after papaverine-induced erection in impotent men. Color Doppler and duplex ultrasonography are used to evaluate Peyronie's disease. Sildenafil cilrate (Viagra) is an effective therapy of ED in men. Vardenavil is a highly selective phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor which improved ED. Prostagland E1, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and phentolamine mesylate (administered by autoinjectors) have been applied to treat ED in patients resistant to other intracavernosal agents. Clinical trials were conducted on self-injection of vasoactive drugs, apomorphine SL, and tadalafil in diabetic men. Medical therapy of ED includes: medicated urethral system for erection (MUSE), intravenous pharmacotherapy, arterial revascularization, vacuum devices, two- and three-component inflatable penile prosthesis, semi-rigid penile prosthesis in situ, and inflatable one-piece penile prosthesis. Surgical therapy include procedures to correct Peyronie's penile deformity and penile deformity, procedures to avoid inevitable shortening accompanying Nesbit's disease, and for penile lengthening."

CD008686,0,15758351,0,Skeletal implications of prostate cancer.,"This manuscript reviews the theories behind the propensity of prostate cancer to cause bone metastases and skeletal implications of the prostate cancer biology and treatment modalities. The escape of tumor cells from the primary tumor in the prostate to secondary tumor sites in the axial skeleton probably occurs before the primary tumor is detected. Several theories offer explanations for the observed proclivity of prostate tumors to selectively colonize the axial skeleton. The interaction between the tumor cells and cells that populate bone marrow, in particular osteoblasts and osteoclasts, is important for creating a 'fertile' environment where tumor cells can establish and grow. Prostate cancer cells are capable of producing growth factors that can affect both osteoblasts, resulting in osteoblastic bone formation, and osteoclasts, resulting in excessive bone resorption. In addition to the capability to progress from testosterone-dependent to testosterone-independent phenotype, the hallmark of metastatic prostate cancer is osteosclerosis similar to one induced experimentally in nude rats using CWR22 human prostate cancer cell line. Metastatic bone disease caused by excessive bone formation and bone resorption is the major cause of morbidity in patients with prostate cancer. The most common symptoms include pain, pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, cranial nerve palsies, bone marrow suppression and hypercalcemia. The introduction of prostate-specific antigen in clinical practice created a shift to where more prostate cancer patients with early disease receive androgen ablation treatment, which in return causes more bone loss and cancer-associated osteoporosis. Introduction of third generation bisphosphonates to treat skeletal consequences of malignancy further stressed the important interaction between the bone marrow stroma and cancer cells. Nevertheless, animal models and human prostate tumor cell lines that mimic all aspects of skeletal conditions in prostate cancer patients including osteoblastic bone response are needed to develop and screen for novel therapeutic and diagnostic modalities."

CD008686,0,15747448,0,Teriparatide: new preparation. Osteoporosis: less well evaluated than alendronic acid.,"(1) Oral alendronic acid is the reference drug for women with osteoporosis and a previous vertebral fracture. In a placebo-controlled trial in women who were also taking calcium and vitamin D, treatment with alendronic acid for three years reduced the incidence of symptomatic vertebral fractures (2.3% versus 5%) and wrist fractures (2.2% versus 4.1%) and, albeit with a lower level of evidence, the incidence of hip fractures (1.1% versus 2.2%). (2) Teriparatide, a biotech drug, reproduces the 34 N-terminal amino acids of parathormone. It is marketed in Europe for subcutaneous treatment of ""proven"" postmenopausal osteoporosis. (3) The cornerstone of the clinical evaluation dossier is a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial in 1637 women also taking calcium and vitamin D. The two doses of teriparatide (20 micrograms/day and 40 micrograms/day), given for a median of 19 months, reduced the risk of new radiologically documented vertebral fractures (about 4% versus 14% in the placebo group) and spinal pain (about 16% versus 23% in the placebo group), but not the risk of hip fracture. (4) In a double-blind trial in 146 postmenopausal women also taking calcium and vitamin D, 40 micrograms/day teriparatide given subcutaneously for 14 months increased spinal mineral bone density significantly more than 10 mg/day alendronic acid given orally. The trial was not designed to show a difference in clinical outcome (fractures). (5) The main adverse effects of teriparatide reported to date are nausea, headache, cramp, hypercalcemia and hyperuricemia. (6) A rat study showed an increased risk of osteosarcoma. This tumour is rare in humans, and the number of patients so far enrolled in clinical trials is insufficient to document a possible increase in risk associated with teriparatide. (7) The need for daily subcutaneous injections and for refrigeration of the prefilled syringes are two notable disadvantages of teriparatide therapy. (8) In practice, alendronic acid is better assessed and remains the reference treatment, combined with calcium and vitamin D, for secondary prevention of osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women."
CD008686,0,15745386,0,Spinal metastases: treatment evaluation algorithm.,"Spinal metastases are only apparently similar lesions, considering the large varieties of istotypes and the spread of the primary tumor. These metastases develop early and are not terminal events, they have to be considered as severe complications because, when possible, surgical treatment can improve the history of the patient in terms of life expectancy and quality of life. The approach to these lesions should be multidisciplinary in collaboration with oncologists and radiotherapists, in fact the average of survival of these patients has increased in recent years. The evolution of anesthaesiological techniques that permit surgical treatments that were once considered prohibitive. The application of new adjuvant therapy increases the effectiveness for surgical treatment. Controversy exist over the most appropriate treatment for patients with metastatic disease of the vertebral column. The purpose of this article was to determine the best sequential process to arrive at the most appropriate treatment considering the individual general conditions and the parameters of the metastases. We review 269 cases in 182 patients suffering from spinal metastases from a solid tumour treated between 1996 and 2002. As the number of treatment options for metastatic spinal disease has grown, it has become clear that effective implementation of these treatments can only be achieved by multidisciplinary approach."

HCC is substantially a complication of liver cirrhosis, and because HBV and HCV are the predominant causes of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis worldwide, they have a propensity to lead to HCC. Common sites of HCC metastases include the lung, lymph nodes, and portal vein. Bony metastases are rare, and when they do occur the disease is usually far advanced and is associated with clinical manifestations of abdominal pain, weight loss, jaundice, hepato-splenomegaly, ascities, deranged LFTs, and elevated AFP. We report here a patient with asymptomatic advanced HCC, normal LFTs, and normal AFP values presenting with spinal cord compression."
CD008686,0,15743153,0,Early detection and treatment of spinal cord compression.,"Several key areas must be considered in the diagnosis and management of spinal cord compression. Because the outcome can be devastating, a diagnosis must be made early and treatment initiated promptly. Although any malignancy can metastasize to the spine, clinicians should be aware that this occurs more commonly in certain diseases, i.e., lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and myeloma. The current algorithm for early diagnosis of spinal cord compression involves neurologic assessment and magnetic resonance imaging of the entire spine. Treatment generally consists of intravenous dexamethasone followed by oral dosing. Depending on the extent of the metastases, symptoms may also be managed with nonnarcotic pain medicines, anti-inflammatory medications, and/or bisphosphonates, with local radiation administered as needed. Surgery has often led to destabilization of the spine."

CD008686,0,15736180,0,Serum leptin levels in Ache Amerindian females with normal adiposity are not significantly different from American anorexia nervosa patients.,"Serum leptin, a polypeptide hormone secreted primarily by adipocytes, is a reflection of somatic fat availability in humans and other vertebrates. Among Ache Amerindians, leptin levels are very low in contrast to other populations, despite comparable adiposity with individuals exhibiting much higher leptin levels. In order to gain a greater understanding of these differences, leptin levels were compared between Ache Amerindian females (n = 12, mean age = 32.2 +/- 14.0 SD), American females diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (n = 22, mean age = 23.0 +/- 4.0), and non-anorectic American controls (n = 23, mean age = 23.0 +/- 4.0). Ache leptin (5.6 +/- 3.2 ng/ml) was not significantly different from anorectic patients (5.6 +/- 3.7 ng/ml; P > 0.98) despite greater adiposity (Ache 33.3% +/- 4.4% vs. anorectic 7.0% +/- 2.0%; P < 0.0001). Ache adiposity was also higher than American controls (leptin 19.1 +/- 8.1 ng/ml; fat 28% +/- 5.0%; P < 0.004) underscoring the uniqueness of Ache leptin profiles. This suggests a greater range of population variation in leptin physiology than previously suspected and intimates the potential role of chronic environmental conditions."
CD008686,0,15734255,0,Less systemic cytokine response in patients following microendoscopic versus open lumbar discectomy.,"The magnitude of the tissue damage from surgery impacts the trauma response. This response is proportional to the severity of surgical stress. Systemic cytokines are recognized as markers of postoperative tissue trauma. Microendoscopic discectomy (MED) recently has become popular for treating lumbar disc herniations, and is associated with favorable clinical outcomes compared with open discectomy (OD). This study postulates that MED is a less traumatic procedure, and therefore has a lower surgical stress response compared to OD. In this study, a quantitative comparison of the overall effects of surgical trauma resulting from MED and OD was performed through analyzing patient systemic cytokines response. From April, 2002 to June, 2003, 22 consecutive patients who had symptomatic lumbar disc herniations were prospectively randomized to undergo either intracanalicular MED (N=10) or OD (N=12). In this study, the Vertebroscope System (Zeppelin, Pullach, Germany) was used to perform the endoscopic discectomy procedure in all MED patients. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) were measured before surgery and at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24h after surgery using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured at the same time interval. The results showed the MED patients had shorter postoperative hospital stay (mean, 3.57+/-0.98 vs. 5.92+/-2.39 days, p=0.025) and less intraoperative blood loss (mean, 87.5+/-69.4 vs. 190+/-115 ml, p=0.042). The operating length, including the set-up time, was longer in the MED group (mean, 109+/-35.9 vs. 72.1+/-17.8 min, p=0.01). The mean size of skin incision made for the MED patients was 1.86+/-0.13 cm (range 1.7-2.0 cm); and 6.3+/-0.98 cm for the OD patients (range 5.5-8 cm), p=0.001. The patients' pain severity of the involved limbs on 10-point Visual Analog Scale before operation in MED group was 7.5+/-0.3 (range 6-9) and 8+/-0.2 (range 7-9) in OD group, p=0.17; and after surgery, 1.5+/-0.2 (range 1-2) in MED group and 1.4+/-0.1 (range 1-3) in OD group, p=0.91. CRP levels peaked at 24h in both groups, and OD patients displayed a significantly greater postoperative rise in serum CRP (mean, 27.78+/-15.02 vs. 13.84+/-6.25mg/l, p=0.026). Concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 were detected only sporadically. Serum IL-6 increased less significantly following MED than after OD. In the MED group, IL-6 level peaked 8h after surgery, with the response statistically less than in the open group (mean, 6.27+/-5.96 vs. 17.18+/-11.60 pg/ml, p=0.025). A statistically significant correlation was identified between IL-6 and CRP values (r=0.79). Using the modified MacNab criteria, the clinical outcomes were 90% satisfactory (9/10) in MED patients and 91.6% satisfactory (11/12) in OD patients at a mean 18.9 months (range 10-25) follow-up. Based on the current data, surgical trauma, as reflected by systemic IL-6 and CRP response, was significantly less following MED than following OD. The difference in the systemic cytokine response may support that the MED procedure is less traumatic. Moreover, our MED patients had achieved satisfactory clinical outcomes as the OD patients at a mean 18.9 months follow-up after surgery."
CD008686,0,15729092,0,Can the back-to-work rate of patients with long-term non-malignant pain be predicted?,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcome of a structured multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme regarding the return-to-work rate. Sixty-seven patients were enrolled in an 8-week, structured rehabilitation programme. The prediction of the return-to-work rate was evaluated before entering the programme. The patients' own perception of returning to work as well as their pain intensity were estimated on a visual analogue scale and their period of sick leave was also recorded. The multidisciplinary rehabilitation team made an impairment and disability evaluation and analysis (IDEA) to assess possible work ability. This evaluation was made during the first 3 weeks of the 8-week programme. The return-to-work rate was also evaluated by means of the modified somatic perception questionnaire (MSPQ) and the disability rating index (DRI) before entering the programme. The results were compared with the actual return-to-work rate 1 year after completing the programme. A comparison group of 14 patients who were rejected due to lack of space in the programme was used in this study. There was a positive, statistically significant correlation (P<0.01) between the evaluation of the multidisciplinary rehabilitation team and the actual outcome of the return-to-work rate 1 year after completing the programme. At the 1-year follow-up, 63% of the patients had returned to work or were in work-related activities. The results on MSPQ or DRI, the patients' own perception of returning to work, the pain intensity, age or the period of time out of work did not predict the return-to-work ability. This study has shown that 63% of the patients with long-term non-malignant pain were back to work or in work-related activities 1 year after completing the rehabilitation programme. The IDEA made by the rehabilitation team was crucial in predicting the return-to-work rate in this patient group. The MSPQ and DRI questionnaires, the patients' own prediction, pain intensity, age and time out of work had a low value for predicting the return-to-work rate following a structured multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme."
CD008686,0,15724942,0,Pathophysiology of bone cancer pain.,"The most common cancers, such as those affecting the breast, prostate, and lung have a strong predilection to metastasize to bone. Bone metastasis frequently results in pain, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression. Pain can have a devastating effect on the quality of life in advanced cancer patients and is a serious complication of cancer. Although significant advances are being made in cancer treatment and diagnosis, the basic neurobiology of bone cancer pain is poorly understood. New insights into the mechanisms that induce cancer pain now are coming from animal models. Chemicals derived from tumor cells, inflammatory cells, and cells derived from bone appear to be involved simultaneously in driving this frequently difficult-to-control pain state. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of bone cancer pain will improve both our ability to provide mechanism-based therapies and the quality of life of cancer patients."
CD008686,0,15723114,0,[Medullar compression].,"Medullar compression is an oncological and neurological emergency, whose diagnosis and early treatment are key factors for avoiding severe and irreversible neurological damage. Paralysis, loss of consciousness and alteration in control of the sphincters are the final consequence of the process, and represent an important source of morbidity of the oncology patient, besides being related to a shorter time of survival. The invasion of the vertebral body by haematogenous dissemination is the most frequent cause of medullar compression. On occasions it can create mechanical vertebral instability which represents a real orthopaedic emergency. Pain is the earliest and most frequent symptom. The signs and symptoms appear to the degree that the process advances, passing through motor weakness, alterations in consciousness until paralysis and incontinence of the sphincters are reached, as a result of complete neurological damage. Clinical history and physical exploration should lead to suspicion about the level at which medullar compression is developing, and the most important complementary exploration is MR of the entire spine, which should be requested immediately in order to decide on starting treatment. Treatment is individualised and must be started early. In general, corticoids in combination with radiotherapeutic oncological treatment and/or surgery are the therapeutic weapons to employ."
CD008686,0,15720233,0,Inhibition of angiogenesis by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: from the bench to the bedside and back.,"The formation of new blood vessels, a process globally referred to as angiogenesis, occurs in a number of pathological conditions, such as cancer and chronic inflammation. Recent findings indicate that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the inducible form of the cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes, acts as a potent inducer of angiogenesis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are classical inhibitors of COX enzymes, which are widely prescribed for the treatment of inflammation, pain and fever. Selective COX-2 inhibitors (COXIBs) have been subsequently developed with the purpose to improve the safety profile of this class of therapeutics. More recently, substantial preclinical evidence demonstrated that NSAIDS and COXIBs have anti-angiogenic properties. This newly recognized activity opens the possibility of using these drugs for the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases. In this article we review the most recent advances in understanding the mechanisms by which NSAIDs and COXIBs suppress angiogenesis, and we discuss their potential clinical use as anti-angiogenic drugs."
CD008686,0,15720215,0,Neuropathic pain: is the end of suffering starting in the gene therapy?,"Neuropathic pain is defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system. It is a devastating and difficult to manage consequence of peripheral nerve injury and has a variety of clinical symptoms. Neuropathic pain is a major health problem. It has been estimated that 70% of patients with advanced cancer and inflammatory pathologies are afflicted by chronic pain. About 95% of patients with spinal cord injuries have neuropathic pain problems. Chronic pain is debilitating and cause of depression and decreasing quality of life. Pharmacological treatment for the symptoms of painful neuropathy is difficult, because there has been limited understanding of the underlying causes and systemic levels that an effective dose can have on multiple side effects. The use of molecular methods, such as gene therapy, stem cell therapy and viral vector for delivery of biologic antinociceptive molecules, has led to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the induction of intractable neuropathic pain."
CD008686,0,15719598,0,Optimizing bisphosphonate therapy in patients with breast cancer on endocrine therapy.,"Deterioration of bone health is a major concern during progression and treatment of patients with breast cancer, especially in postmenopausal women. Disease- and treatment-associated skeletal-related events include fractures, spinal compression, bone pain, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Bisphosphonates, which inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption, are important new agents in the management of skeletal-related events, and their impact on breast cancer-related bone metastases and on bone loss during long-term estrogen deprivation therapies such as aromatase inhibitors is reviewed. Intravenous pamidronate has become the standard bisphosphonate to reduce or delay skeletal complications of advanced breast cancer bone metastases, but the more potent agent, zoledronic acid, appears to be at least as effective. Another agent, ibandronate, is also active but has not been investigated in comparison with the other intravenous bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid is the most convenient to administer, requiring only a short infusion. The effects of bisphosphonates on bone health in women with early breast cancer are also being investigated. A single yearly infusion of zoledronic acid has been shown to significantly increase bone mineral density in osteoporotic postmenopausal women and to reduce biochemical markers of bone turnover. The possibility of such treatment-reversing aromatase inhibitor-associated bone loss during adjuvant therapy of breast cancer is being evaluated in a trial of letrozole, with zoledronic acid added initially or after the onset of bone loss or fracture."

CD008686,0,15717997,0,Management of bone metastases in breast cancer.,"Patients with advanced breast cancer who develop bone metastases suffer an ongoing risk of skeletal complications that can have a significant impact on their quality of life (QoL). These complications include bone pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM), a potentially life-threatening condition. Treatment options include radiotherapy to palliate bone pain and/or prevent impending fracture, orthopedic surgery to prevent or repair fractures, analgesics, and bisphosphonates, which can significantly reduce the risk of skeletal complications and delay their onset. Of the known bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid is the most potent. Since its regulatory approval in the United States and Europe in 2001, zoledronic acid (4 mg by 15-minute infusion) has become widely used and has replaced pamidronate (90 mg by 2-hour infusion) as the standard of care for treating bone metastases from breast cancer and bone lesions from multiple myeloma. Zoledronic acid has also demonstrated significant long-term benefits in randomized trials in prostate cancer and other solid tumors, whereas other bisphosphonates have failed. In long-term, phase III clinical testing, zoledronic acid provided significant treatment benefits beyond those of pamidronate in patients with breast cancer and demonstrated a safety profile comparable with pamidronate. Therefore, zoledronic acid is now recommended from the first diagnosis of bone metastasis. Other intravenous bisphosphonates include clodronate and ibandronate. Both are approved in Europe, but their efficacy relative to pamidronate and zoledronic acid is not known."
CD008686,0,15708229,0,Idiopathic severe recurrent transverse myelitis: a restricted variant of neuromyelitis optica.,"Recurrent idiopathic transverse myelitis occur in multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). In NMO, acute optic neuritis and myelitis occur, either monophasic or relapsing, without clinical manifestations of involvement of other parts of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent evidence suggests that NMO is different from multiple sclerosis. The authors reported two patients having severe recurrent transverse myelitis sparing the optic nerves and cerebral hemispheres. Both patients had longitudinally extensive myelitis in some attacks with poor neurological outcome despite aggressive immunomodulatory therapy. One patient had prominent clinical features of brainstem injury with radiological and histological confirmation of brainstem involvement, and the other patient had trigeminal neuralgia suggestive of possible brainstem dysfunction. Histologically, prominent necrosis and neutrophilic infiltration of spinal cord tissue without eosinophils or hyalinized vessels were observed, and oligoclonal bands were absent in their cerebrospinal fluid. It is likely to be a distinct idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorder restricted to the spinal cord and brainstem different from MS, but within the spectrum of NMO with probably an autoimmune basis."

Neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1) is a genetic syndrome associated with soft tissue sarcoma and higher risk of developing neoplasia. Lateral meningoceles are uncommon entities, being mostly associated with NF-1.

CNL has been associated with multiple myelomas in many reported cases, but transition of Polycythemia Vera (PV) to CNL is very rare. An 81-year-old female patient, who had undergone intermittent phlebotomy following the diagnosis of PV 8 years previously, was admitted to our hospital due to lower back pain. A physical examination showed a splenomegaly 2 cm below the costal margin, with tenderness of the thoracic and lumbar spine area. A peripheral blood examination showed a WBC count of 91,800/microL (neutrophil 88%) with a rare immature form, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL and a platelet count of 1,661,000/microL. Her NAP score was 58. The bone marrow examination showed 95% cellularity, with an M:E ratio of 10:1, increased megakaryocytes with normal morphology and the absence of myelofibrosis. Chromosomal studies showed no Philadelphia chromosome. A radiological examination showed compression fractures of the vertebrae and spinal cord compression. No underlying disease causing a leukemoid reaction was detected. With iron replacement, the hemoglobin level failed to increase over 12 g/dL. Therefore, it was concluded to be a transition of PV to CNL. After administration of hydroxyurea and vertebroplasty, the symptom improved and the WBC count was sustained below 40,000/microL."

CD008686,0,15648288,0,Meningeal hemangiopericytoma with delayed multiple distant metastases.,"A 43-year-old housewife suffered from an occipital headache, and brain computed tomography (CT) showed an occipital meningeal tumor. She received a complete tumor excision and the tumor pathology was interpreted as atypical meningioma. Five years later, a subacute left neck pain with radiation to the left arm occurred. A tumor invading the second and third cervical vertebrae with compression on the dural sac was found. Angiography revealed hypervascular tumor staining supplied from the left vertebral artery. CT-guided biopsy was performed and nests of atypical spindle cells accompanied by staghorn vascular pattern were revealed histologically. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive vimentin staining but negative reactions to epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin low molecular weight, cytokeratin high molecular weight, CD34 and S-100 protein. Estimation of the Ki-67 proliferative (mitotic) index by using MIB-1 monoclonal antibody was 12%. Later on, a systemic survey revealed lesions in the left lung, liver and kidney. The diagnosis was revised to hemangiopericytoma. Distant metastasis is common in this tumor. However, the delayed multiple metastases without local recurrence were relatively rare. The clinical course in this patient also supported that a high mitotic activity may correlate with a poor prognosis even if the pathology is taken from the metastatic tissue, and that long-term follow-up is mandatory. Detailed immunohistochemical staining is helpful in avoiding misdiagnosis of meningioma."

Chest CT revealed a mass shadow in the right S6 together with destruction of the thoracic vertebrae. These findings suggested lung cancer and its spinal invasion. A transbronchial lung biopsy specimen showed inflammatory lymphocyte infiltration. MRI T2 image of the spine showed a high intensity at the Th7/8 disc space, suggesting pyogenic spondylitis. After broad-spectrum antibiotics including PAMP/BP and CLDM were administered, both the spinal lesion and the pulmonary lesion improved gradually. The clinical course suggested that the pulmonary inflammatory lesion had spread from pyogenic spondylitis. In our case, the pyogenic spondylitis was mimicking a spinal invasion of lung cancer. In addition, MRI is thought to be useful for diagnosing spinal lesions."

CD008686,0,15553951,0,Cervicobrachialgia and pancoast tumor: value of standard anteroposterior cervical radiographs in early diagnosis.,"Ten patients diagnosed with Pancoast tumor were studied retrospectively. The definitive diagnosis was made between 2 and 24 months after the onset of pain. Pain localization was hard to pinpoint; some patients reported pain in four different sites (neck, shoulder, arm, and scapula). Five patients had previously been diagnosed with degenerative, inflammatory, or infectious diseases of the cervical spine or shoulder. In the remaining five patients, the diagnosis was made during the first clinical visit. In three patients, an orthopedic surgeon made the diagnosis by viewing a standard anteroposterior (AP) cervical radiograph. The radiographic evidence arousing suspicion of a Pancoast tumor was the lack of pulmonary air at the top of the affected lung. Furthermore, a parallel study was conducted on 100 consecutive patients seeking treatment for neck pain. By examining the AP radiographs of their cervical spines, the third rib and the top of both lungs were observed in all cases. This study stresses the value of standard AP cervical radiographs in the diagnosis of Pancoast tumor."
CD008686,0,15552953,0,[A case of pharyngolaryngeal edema after posterior occipito-cervical operation].,"A 70-year-old female developed respiratory failure due to pharyngolaryngeal edema after posterior occipito-cervical fusion. She had a history of total thyroidectomy with bilateral neck dissection for advanced thyroid cancer associated with multiple lung metastases. However, her general condition was good, and she was not in cachexia. Her pulmonary function test revealed %VC of 54% and %FEV1.0 of 79%. This posterior occipito-cervical fusion was necessary for pain relief. Twenty-four hours after surgery she suddenly showed dyspnea, requiring tracheal intubation, and was supported by mechanical ventilation. The pharyngolaryngeal edema was recognized with bronchoscopy from the lower larynx with arytenoid region to nasal choana. In several days she recovered from pharyngolaryngeal edema and was extubated. She was discharged from ICU after close observation for 24 hours after extubation. She developed respiratory distress again due to difficulty in sputum expectoration, resulting in emergency tracheostomy an the floor at midnight. In this case, pharyngolaryngeal edema may have been caused by disturbance of lymphatic flow due to posterior occipito-cervical fusion in a patient with a past history of bilateral neck dissection.

Preoperative clinical and laboratory examinations revealed no abnormalities. An epidural catheter was inserted into the L3-4 interspace and 1.5% lidocaine 10 ml was injected smoothly with no abnormal signs. Thirty minutes after the injection, involuntary movement of lower extremities was noticed. When the catheter was removed after the operation, there was neither hemorrhage nor pain at the puncture site. Neither sensory disorder nor paralysis occurred while the movement continued for 150 minutes. No abnormal findings which might cause the involuntary movement were detected by clinical examinations including the cerebral CT and lumbar MRI. The detailed mechanism of the involuntary movement was not clarified, but exclusion of several complications including epidural hematoma by CT and MRI examination is essential for further diagnosis and treatment."
CD008686,0,15551179,0,Surgical aspects and outcome of delayed tethered cord release.,"Out of a total of 550 children followed up at our spina bifida center, we report on 81 patients who were reoperated upon for secondary tethered cord syndrome between 1993 and 2000. In four cases with preceding severe progressive scoliosis, untethering was followed by surgical correction and stabilization of curvatures. In 77 patients, the indication for surgery was based on late progressive neurological deterioration. The current clinical relevance of competing etiologic factors such as symptomatic Chiari malformation, hydromyelia, and shunt dysfunction, requiring different clinical management, had been previously carefully excluded. The children underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or myelo-computed tomography (m-CT) to identify the morphologic extent of tethering and any associated spinal malformations such as dermoid tumors (19 cases) or diastematomyelia (9 cases). Surgery became faster and safer through bilateral dural incision, undercutting arachnoid adhesions along the tethered area, although this procedure increased the need for dural grafting. Complete release of the conus medullaris and cauda equina was achieved in a total of 75 cases (93 %) including those who had undergone prophylactic surgery. A mean follow-up of 4.8 years in 77 patients operated upon for late progressive neurological deterioration confirmed stabilization of presenting symptoms in 65 cases (84 %) with 20 of them (26 %) even showing significant improvement. In 12 patients (16 %), including all cases of incomplete untethering (n = 4), there was further deterioration."
CD008686,0,15545939,0,[Pediatric neuroimaging emergencies].,"The notion of emergency with regards to pediatric neuroimaging requires a strong knowledge of clinical indications. In children under 2 years of age, head trauma requires a CT scan in case of repeated or prolonged or rapidly increasing vomiting, focal signs, loss of consciousness, unusual behavior, seizures, clinical signs of skull fracture or polytrauma. The ""shaken baby syndrome"" is usually suspected in case of loss of consciousness or seizures before 8 months of age. The hematomas that are observed are subdural in location, diffuse and deeply located. Imaging is only mandatory for headache suggesting underlying space occupying lesion: permanent or increasing pain, nocturnal headache, headache during postural changes or efforts, associated to seizures or abnormal neurological examination. No imaging is indicated in case of first epileptic seizure associated to normal neurological examination and without any particular context. The presence of trauma, intracranial hypertension, persisting disturbances of consciousness or associated focal sign necessitates urgent neuroimaging. No imaging is indicated in case of typical febrile seizures, i.e. generalized, brief and occurring between 1 and 5 years of age. Spinal cord symptoms require immediate MRI evaluation. The most frequent tumor is neuroblastoma. In the absence of spinal tumor, brain abnormalities must be excluded (inflammatory disease). In neonates, CT scan or MRI must be readily performed in case of seizures or loss of consciousness to exclude ischemic, traumatic or infectious lesions."
CD008686,0,15540676,0,Cancer pain management in children.,"Unrelieved pain may have a major impact on the care of children with cancer. The type and severity of pain experienced by children with cancer varies from acute, procedure-related pain to progressive chronic pain associated with the progression of the disease or sequelae of treatment. Drugs are the mainstay of treatment. Regular pain assessments combined with appropriate analgesic administration at regular dosing intervals, adjunctive drug therapy for control of adverse effects and associated symptoms, and nonpharmacological interventions are recommended. Although standard dosing of opioids adequately treats most cancer pain in children, more complex treatment is required by a significant group. Strategies to improve analgesia include the use of epidural or intrathecal infusions of a combination of opioids and other adjuvants, or other regional anaesthesia techniques. Procedure- and treatment-related pain is an even greater problem than cancer pain. Recommendations have been published with regard to the monitoring and personnel required when children are sedated which aim to set the standard of care and minimize both physical discomfort or pain and negative psychological responses, by providing analgesia; and to maximize the potential for amnesia; and to control behaviour."

We performed impar ganglion blockade through sacrococcygeal junction instead of anococcygeal ligament in 9 patients who had localized perineal pain of visceral origin. All the blocks which were performed through sacrococcygeal junction without bending the needle under fluoroscopic guidance were easy to perform without any complication. Pain intensity by Visual Analogue Scale, daily opioid requirements, and complications related to opioids were evaluated before the procedure, and for 2 months after the procedure. The intensity of pain, daily opioid requirement and the complication related to the opioids were significantly decreased in 8 patients. We suggest that impar ganglion block through sacrococcygeal junction appears to be safe and effective procedure in the management of perineal pain related to malignancy."

CD008686,0,15508997,0,Topical review: new insights into the pathology and diagnosis of disorders of the temporomandibular joint.,"The collection of conditions affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and masticatory muscles, the so-called temporomandibular disorders, can be classified according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders. Of the 3 subgroups--muscle disorders (Group I); disc displacements (Group II); and arthralgia, arthritis, and arthrosis (Group III)--the muscle disorders are most frequently seen in community samples; Group II and Group III diagnoses are less prevalent. This may explain the relative scarcity of studies involving intracapsular TMJ disorders. In this review, new insights into the functional anatomy, imaging, and pathology of disorders of the TMJ are presented. Studies of TMJ dynamics may provide insight into the functional anatomy of the TMJ and thereby into the consequences of Group II and Group III disorders. The clinical use of imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for the TMJ and related structures remains controversial. Nevertheless, imaging is regularly used in the diagnosis of some Group II and Group III disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging may be of use not only for the visualization of disc displacements but also for the study of bone mineral density of the condyle. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) play an important role in TMJ pathology. For example, IL-1beta, which has been associated with TMJ pain, hyperalgesia, and anterior bite opening, is mostly absent in the synovial fluid of healthy joints. Since both IL-1 and TNFalpha are involved in the development of chronic pain and joint destruction, they may be the targets for specific treatments. While the advances reviewed in this paper are significant, multidisciplinary efforts and formation of international research collaborations will be necessary to continue advancement in the understanding of TMJ pathology and diagnosis."

The aim of our study was to gather new evidence- based information on the occupational reintegration of teachers who took early retirement and to investigate to what extent official medical reactivation examinations are an effective instrument of tertiary prevention. DATABASE AND METHODS: In a prospective total assessment (the entire state of Bavaria) over the period of 1997 - 1999 all official medical examinations in the public health centres (Gesundheitsamter und Medizinische Untersuchungsstellen der Bezirksregierungen) were evaluated with regard to the reactivation of teachers unfit for work.

CD008686,0,15490274,0,Changes in biochemical markers of bone in patients with insufficiency fractures.,"Twelve patients presented at our department with low back or buttock pain and were diagnosed as suffering from insufficiency fracture. All patients were evaluated with plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or bone scintigraphy. We also measured biochemical markers of bone turnover in these patients. Bone scintigraphy revealed a high uptake in the fracture site in all patients with insufficiency fracture. Biochemical markers of bone turnover were significantly increased in all patients, but decreased after the fracture healed and the pain was resolved. In those patients who complained of pain again, the biochemical markers of bone turnover had increased once more, and bone scintigraphy showed a new fracture at a different site. Because the changes in bone turnover markers were closely related to clinical symptoms of insufficiency fracture, we speculated that repeated measurements of bone turnover markers may be informative for discriminating insufficiency fracture from bone metastasis."
CD008686,0,15483007,0,Sacral insufficiency fracture.,"Insufficiency fractures of the sacrum are not uncommon and usually occur in osteoporotic bone with minimal or unremembered trauma. However, they appear to be relatively under-diagnosed and this pictorial review aims to highlight the condition, discuss the expected imaging features and some of the potential imaging pitfalls. Owing to its relationship with osteoporosis, the majority occur in elderly females and are frequently bilateral, often presenting as low back pain. Plain radiographs are generally normal and both clinician and radiologist need to consider the possibility of sacral insufficiency fracture to allow prompt accurate diagnosis and correct treatment. Lumbar spine MRI is among the first investigations performed and can enable the correct diagnosis to be made. Occasionally the MR appearances can mimic tumour or osteomyelitis. The ""H"" sign on an isotope bone scan is considered diagnostic in the right clinical setting, but this sign is often not present. CT is useful to confirm the diagnosis and exclude tumour or infection."

However, they have not dealt with the impact of relatively common comorbid conditions in this age group, such as spinal stenosis, and they have not explicitly addressed the use of imaging as a prognostic indicator for the restoration of vertebral body height. Neither have these studies dealt with management and technical problems related to surgery, nor the effectiveness of bone biopsy during the same surgical procedure. This is a prospective study comparing preoperative and postoperative vertebral body heights, kyphotic deformities, pain intensity (using visual analogue scale) and quality of life (Oswestry disability questionnaire) in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) and osteolytic vertebral tumors treated with balloon kyphoplasty."
CD008686,0,15478027,0,Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis.,"Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a clinical entity distinct from bacterial osteomyelitis. It occurs mainly in children and adolescents and is characterized by a prolonged, fluctuating course with recurrent episodes of pain occurring over several years. CRMO is often multifocal and most often seen in tubular bones, the clavicle, and less frequently the spine and pelvic bones; other locations are rare. The radiographic appearance suggests subacute or chronic osteomyelitis. Histopathological and laboratory findings are nonspecific and bacterial culture is usually negative. CRMO is often diagnosed by exclusion of the two main differential diagnoses--bacterial infections and tumor--by assessing for a characteristic course and the findings by conventional radiography, if necessary supplemented by scintigraphy and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI appearance of CRMO lesions in tubular bones and the spine is often rather characteristic and support the diagnosis. It is important to diagnose CRMO to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures and initiate an appropriate therapy."

CD008686,0,15459785,0,Spinal tuberculosis: with reference to the children of northern India.,"Tuberculosis is a necrotizing bacterial infection with protean manifestation and wide distribution. There has been a great fall in the prevalence of tuberculosis in the United States since 1990, although the impact of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has increased the resurgence of tuberculosis (TB). Spinal tuberculosis is the commonest form of skeletal tuberculosis. In this article, an overview of spinal tuberculosis and the personal experience of 19 children with spinal tuberculosis are presented. All the children required surgical intervention, because they manifested neurological deficit. PATHOGENESIS AND CLINICAL FEATURES: The spinal tuberculosis is a result of hematogenous dissemination from primary focus in the lungs or the lymph nodes. The central type of vertebral tuberculosis spreads along with Batson's plexus of veins, while paradiscal infection spreads through the arteries. The anterior type of vertebral body tuberculosis results from the extension of the abscess beneath the anterior longitudinal ligament and periosteum. Two types of bone and joint tuberculosis are recognized: the caseous, exudative type with abscess formation, which is more common in children, and the granular type is frequent in adults. Only 7 of the 19 children had an abscess, while 10 manifested mainly granulation tissue. Although spinal tuberculosis is an extradural disease, 2 children had intramedullary granulomas and presented a tumor-like syndrome as rare manifestations. It was interesting to encounter intradural granulation and organized intradural granuloma causing cord compression in 2 children.

An exact diagnosis may be difficult even when the primary tumour is known. Patients usually present with back pain and signs and symptoms of spinal cord compression, such as hemiparesis or hemisensory impairments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered to be the main diagnostic tool for intramedullary lesions as it is very sensitive, but non-specific, in distinguishing between ISCMs and primary cord tumours. Optimal treatment in patients with ISCMs remains controversial. We report a case of ISCMs of melanoma, with a review of the clinical and radiological characteristics of these medullary lesions and their prognosis, as well as the different therapeutic approaches."

CD008686,0,15450886,0,Management of pain associated with spinal tumor.,"Metastatic spinal disease is common in cancer patients, and it is a frequent source of pain and disability. Expert management of the patient's pain and neurologic dysfunction is required. Neurosurgical advances have afforded the patient the opportunity to have improved symptom management and improved quality-of-life outcomes. Patients and their families are best served by the provision of supportive care by specialty pain medicine and palliative care services (especially neurology based) working with the primary neurosurgical team in an integrated model."
CD008686,0,15450875,0,Evolution of treatment for metastatic spine disease.,"The management of patients with metastatic disease of the spine should be highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the clinical presentation, duration of symptoms, tu-mor type, anticipated radiosensitivity, tumor lo-cation, extent of extraspinal disease, integrity of the spinal column, and medical fitness and life expectancy of the patient. Early diagnosis and intervention are of paramount importance in improving the likelihood of functional neurologic recovery, with the maintenance of ambulation as the primary goal. Effective management of axial spinal pain involves reconstruction and stabilization of the spinal column. Although the ideal therapy has not been established, a wide range of management options is currently available."

Symptomatic spinal metastases produce a characteristic clinical syndrome beginning with local back or neck pain. All too often, the significance of presenting pain is not appreciated and correct diagnosis is delayed until more blatant manifestations of spinal cord or nerve root dysfunction are manifest. Pain is followed by weakness,numbness, and sphincter dysfunction. The natural history is one of relentless progression to complete and irreversible paralysis unless timely treatment is undertaken. Plain radiographs provide a simple and useful screening test. MRI is, however, the imaging method of choice, providing information concern-ing the level, location, and geometry of the spinal tumor as well as details concerning the bony integrity of the spine, particularly adjacent to a culpable tumor, all of which is essential to determine the management options and treatment strategies. Percutaneous image-guided biopsy is a useful test to establish a tissue diagnosis."

CD008686,0,15379894,0,The arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha activation of microglia and extends survival of G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice.,"Familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be caused by mutations in copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Mice expressing SOD1 mutants demonstrate a robust neuroinflammatory reaction characterized, in part, by up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and its primary receptor TNF-RI. In an effort to identify small molecule inhibitors of neuroinflammation useful in treatment of ALS, a microglial culture system was established to identify TNFalpha antagonists. Walker EOC-20 microglia cells were stimulated with recombinant TNFalpha, with or without inhibitors, and the cell response was indexed by NO2- output. Three hundred and fifty-five rationally selected compounds were included in this bioassay. The arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase (5LOX) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a natural dicatechol, was one of the most potent non-cytotoxic antagonists tested (IC50 8 +/- 3 microm). Investigation of the G93A-SOD1 mouse model for ALS revealed increased message and protein levels of 5LOX at 120 days of age. Oral NDGA (2500 p.p.m.) significantly extended lifespan and slowed motor dysfunction in this mouse, when administration was begun relatively late in life (90 days). NDGA extended median total lifespan of G93A-SOD1 mice by 10%, and life expectancy following start of treatment was extended by 32%. Disease-associated gliosis and cleaved microtubule-associated tau protein, an indicator of axon damage, were likewise reduced by NDGA. Thus, TNFalpha antagonists and especially 5LOX inhibitors might offer new opportunities for treatment of ALS."

While the continuous administration of a seemingly significant daily dose neither relieved pain nor caused measurable clinical changes, the addition of small, presumably negligible bolus doses on top of the continuous infusion resulted in spectacular pain control, clear thermoanalgesic suspended block, and in one of the patients, significant hypotension. To the best of our knowledge, such an observation has neither been reported before nor can we provide a satisfactory explanation for it. However, we believe it may have significant implications for the treatment of some patients, in particular, cancer patients with mechanical pain that cannot be adequately relieved with morphine whatever the route of administration."

We review the literature and present our algorithm for using neuraxial analgesia. We also present our outcomes using this algorithm over a 28-month period. We used neuraxial analgesia in 87 of 4,107 patients, approximately 2% of those seen for pain consultation. Evaluation of those patients at an 8-week follow-up revealed improved pain control. After institution of neuraxial analgesia, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with severe pain (defined as a ""pain worst"" score in the severe range of 7-10), from 86% to 17%, noted to be highly statistically significant. At follow-up, numerical pain scores decreased significantly from 7.9 +/- 1.6 to 4.1 +/- 2.3. No difference was noted between the intrathecal and epidural groups. Oral opioid intake after instituting neuraxial analgesia revealed a significant decrease from 588 mg/day oral morphine equivalents to 294 mg/day. At follow-up, self-reported drowsiness and mental clouding (0-10) also significantly decreased from 6.2 +/- 3.0 and 5.4 +/- 3.4 to 3.2 +/- 3.0 and 3.1 +/- 3.0, respectively.

CD008686,0,15351947,0,[Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis].,"Retroperitoneal fibrosis is an uncommon disease, characterized by the replacement of normal retroperitoneal tissue with fibrosis and/or chronic inflammation. In two thirds of the cases retroperitoneal fibrosis is idiopathic (IRF), whereas in the remaining ones it is secondary/associated to cancer, infections, drugs, autoimmune disease and vasculitis. IRF appears as a dense, fibrous plaque that usually arises between the level of the lower aorta and the common iliac arteries. As the plaque progresses, it engulfs the adjacent structures (e. g., ureters). In its early stages IRF is characterized by a rich infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages interspersed within fibroblasts and collagen bundles. In its advanced stages it becomes relatively avascular and acellular with abundant collagen bundles and scattered calcifications. The pathogenesis is unknown: some Authors suggest that IRF is a consequence of a local autoimmune reaction against atherosclerotic plaque antigens whereas others propose that it is the manifestation of a systemic autoimmune disease. The presenting signs and symptoms are non-specific; systemic manifestations (fever, anorexia, weight loss), often associated with local symptoms, are usually found to be related to the entrapment of retroperitoneal structures. The most common local symptom is lumbar and/or abdominal pain. The treatment can be surgical and/or medical: the former is required when obstructive complications are present; the latter, associated or not with surgery, can significantly improve the outcome of IRF patients and usually modifies the natural history of the disease. Steroids and tamoxifen are the most used drugs, whereas other agents such as azathioprine, methotrexate and cyclosporine are usually given to non-responder patients."

Report of two cases.,"Primary lymphomas of the sacrum are rare tumors, reported only in a few cases in the literature. The authors describe two patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas presenting as a sacral tumor. In the first case a 52-year-old man presented with progressive back pain, bilateral radicular pain, and saddle block anesthesia secondary to a lytic, expansile soft-tissue mass. The mass arose from the sacrum and eroded through the right S-1 to S-4 foramina and extended into the epidural space of the spinal canal. On magnetic resonance imaging, the sacral mass enhanced homogeneously with Gd. In the second case a 64-year-old man presented with left-sided radicular pain, paresthesias, and progressive weakness due to a lytic soft-tissue mass in the left sacral ala extending into the left L-5 and S-1 foramina. Metastatic workup in each patient demonstrated unremarkable findings. In both cases, an open biopsy procedure was performed after nondiagnostic examination of needle biopsy samples. Histopathological examination showed evidence consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in both patients. In the first case the disease was classified as Stage IAE, and the patient subsequently underwent four cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone (CHOP)- and rituximab-based chemotherapy followed by consolidation radiotherapy. In the second case the disease was also classified as Stage IAE, and the patient underwent CHOP-based chemotherapy and consolidation radiotherapy. In both cases radiography demonstrated a decrease in size of the sacral lymphomas. The authors review the clinical, radiological, and histological features of sacral lymphomas. Lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sacral tumors."
CD008686,0,15350040,0,Current management of sacral chordoma.,"Sacral chordomas are relatively rare, locally invasive, malignant neoplasms. Although metastasis is infrequent at presentation, the prognosis for patients with chordoma of the sacrum is reported to be poor and attributable in most cases to intralesional resection. The value of adjuvant treatment is uncertain, and resection remains the primary mode of treatment. Chordomas are difficult to excise completely, but recent improvements in imaging and surgical techniques have allowed surgeons to perform more frequently en bloc sacral resections with wide surgical margins. The technical challenges of such operations, and the functional costs for the patient (with respect to anorectal and urogenital dysfunction) are significantly increased when the tumor involves high sacral levels. The authors review the clinical presentation and natural history of sacral chordoma and discuss the current treatment techniques and outcomes."

Functional status was assessed preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively using the Oswestry Disability Index. Restoration of anterior and midvertebral height was assessed using lateral radiographs. Meaningful improvement occurred in 16 of 19 patients, with a reduction of the average Oswestry Disability Index from 49 +/- 16.6 to 32.6 +/- 13.6. Partial restoration of anterior vertebral body height was achieved in 76% of levels with an average of 37.8% restoration of the defect. Partial restoration of midvertebral body height was achieved in 91% of levels with an average restoration of 53.4% of the defect. There were no significant complications. These results were compared with results of a cohort of 26 patients with osteoporotic compression fractures treated with kyphoplasty at 37 levels. There was no difference between the groups in terms of Oswestry Disability Index improvement and midvertebral height restoration after 3 months. Greater anterior vertebral height restoration was achieved in the osteoporotic group (51.2% versus 37.8%). Kyphoplasty is a safe treatment modality for myeloma-related vertebral compression fractures. Efficacy in terms of pain relief and functional outcome is comparable with the results in patients with osteoporosis."
CD008686,0,15341675,0,Osteoclast-targeted therapy for prostate cancer.,"Skeletal complications are a major cause of morbidity in men with metastatic prostate cancer. Bone metastases cause pain, fractures, spinal-cord compression, and ineffective hematopoiesis. Men without bone metastases are also at risk for skeletal complications. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the mainstay of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer and a routine part of the management for many men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, decreases bone mineral density, and increases fracture risk. Pathological osteoclast activation plays a central role in both disease and treatment-related skeletal morbidity. Bisphosphonates, potent inhibitors of osteoclast activity, are now an important part of the management for many men with prostate cancer. Zoledronic acid, a potent intravenous bisphosphonate, decreases the risk of skeletal complications in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone metastases. Zoledronic acid and pamidronate preserve bone mineral density in men receiving ADT for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Ongoing clinical trials will evaluate the role of osteoclast-targeted therapy in other settings including prevention of treatment-related fractures, prevention of bone metastases in men with high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer, and prevention of skeletal complications in men with hormone-sensitive metastatic disease."

CD008686,0,15336342,0,The management of malignant psoas syndrome: case reports and literature review.,"Malignant psoas syndrome (MPS) was first described in 1990, and is characterized by proximal lumbosacral plexopathy, painful fixed flexion of the ipsilateral hip, and radiological or pathological evidence of ipsilateral psoas major muscle malignant involvement. There have been 23 case reports of MPS in medical journals. Despite being associated with a severe and difficult pain, there is no definitive approach to management presented in the palliative care literature. We review the relevant clinical features and the subsequent multidisciplinary pain management in relation to four new cases of malignant involvement of the psoas muscle, and the 23 case reports in the literature. We propose that MPS comprises a continuum of symptoms and signs related to the degree of anatomical destruction with associated inflammatory reaction and muscle spasm, and also the degree of lumbosacral plexopathy causing neuropathic pain. A protocol is presented for the management of the complex pain issues of MPS directed at likely mechanisms. The treatment options include opioids, agents for neuropathic pain, muscle relaxants to manage psoas muscle spasm, and anti-inflammatory agents to reduce peritumoral edema. Direct anti-tumor measures also need to be considered. Further prospective study is needed to validate the proposed methods of assessment and treatment."
CD008686,0,15321410,0,Does pregnancy increase the efficacy of lumbar epidural anesthesia?,"Pregnancy has been reported to enhance the sensitivity of nerves to local anesthetics and to decrease anesthetic requirements during regional anesthesia. In this study, whether pregnancy increased the efficacy of lumbar epidural anesthesia was evaluated. Two populations (14 pregnant and 14 non-pregnant women) undergoing lumbar epidural anesthesia were studied and received 17 mL of 2% lidocaine-epinephrine (1: 200,000). The pain threshold response after repeated electrical stimulation was used to assess sensory blockade at the L2, S1 and S3 dermatomes. Motor blockade was evaluated using the Bromage score. Demographic data except for weight were comparable between the two groups. There was a significant difference in cephalad spread of anesthesia between the groups. No significant differences in pain threshold or onset of sensory blockade at the L2, S1 or S3 segments were found between the groups. The pain thresholds at the S1 and S3 dermatomes were significantly lower than that at L2 within each group. The mean onset times at the S1 and S3 dermatomes were significantly longer than that at L2 within each group. No differences in Bromage score were found between the groups. In pregnant women, cephalad spread of epidural anesthesia was facilitated but latency of blockade, density and motor blockade were not. It takes over 25 min to achieve satisfactory blockade at sacral segments. Those who perform lumbar epidural anesthesia alone for cesarean section should consider the use of additives (e.g. fentanyl, bicarbonate) to enhance the block, or a greater volume of local anesthetic."

The radionuclide bone scan suggested metastatic lesions of the L3-L4 vertebrae. However cobalt treatment was ineffective. A bone biopsy of L4 showed an inflammatory pattern and antibiotic therapy was started which did not produce any clinical improvement. Six months after the onset of the back pain brucellar spondylitis was serologically diagnosed and treatment with doxycycline and streptomycin produced a significant clinical and radiological improvement. After 2 months the patient's wife presented with fever and lumbar pain, and brucellar spondylitis was diagnosed as well. An extensive epidemiological examination revealed that 8 months earlier the family had eaten unpasteurized goat cheese and serological examination of the entire family showed that 3 out of 4 members had significant titres of brucellar antibodies. Finally it was discovered that 4 months after consuming the cheese the third infected subject experienced an episode of epidydimoorchitis for which no diagnosis and effective treatment was found. This family cluster of brucellar infection indicates that a high degree of suspicion in the diagnosis of brucellosis is necessary even in non-endemic areas, to reduce the delay in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease and to prevent the occurrence of complications that may prove difficult to treat."

Despite the prevalence of degenerative spinal disease, symptomatic synovial cysts are extremely uncommon. We report a rare case that showed an exacerbation of a cervical radiculopathy due to an acute expansion of the synovial cyst. Magnetic resonance (MR) images originally revealed a small cystic extradural lesion when the patient presented with neck pain and slightly numbness in the right hand. The patient's complaints subsequently subsided after administration of pain killers. However, 2 weeks after this, the patient experienced a spontaneous, sudden, severe radiating pain into the right arm without any accompanying cervical injury. MR images showed that the cyst had become markedly increased in size in the intervening 4 weeks and compressed the spinal cord laterally. Because the arm pain was so severe and neurologic examinations revealed the paralysis of the C8 nerve root, the synovial cyst was excised surgically and a good clinical outcome achieved. Thus, even if symptoms are mild and the size of the synovial cyst is small, acute expansion of the cyst might be rarely observed and careful management, including surgical consideration, is needed."

Cysts form as a result of arthrotic disruption of the facet joint, leading to degenerative spondylolisthesis in up to 40% of patients. Clinical findings and neurodiagnostic confirmation prompt surgical intervention consisting of varying decompressions with or without primary fusion. Most patients present in their mid-60s, with a male-to-female ratio varying from 2:1 to 1:1. Preoperative symptoms include low back pain, radiculopathy, and neurogenic claudication. Motor and sensory signs usually reflect the anatomic location of the synovial cyst and the level of resultant maximal lumbar stenosis. In descending order of frequency, they are typically found at the L4-L5, L5-S1, L3-L4, and L2-L3 levels. Lumbar synovial cyst surgery includes unilateral or bilateral laminotomies, hemilaminectomies, or laminectomies alone or in combination with in situ or instrumented fusion. Those patients undergoing decompression alone may postoperatively develop progression or the new appearance of olisthy, while those primarily fused rarely show further increase or a new onset of slip.

CD008686,0,15275792,0,The effects of early or late neurolytic sympathetic plexus block on the management of abdominal or pelvic cancer pain.,"Neurolytic sympathetic plexus block (NSPB) has been proposed to prevent the development of pain and improve the quality of life of patients with cancer, thus questioning the WHO protocol that proposes the use of invasive methods only as a final resort. This study evaluates the pain relief, opioid consumption and quality of life provided by the use of NSPB in two different phases of cancer pain and compares them with that provided by pharmacological therapy only. Sixty patients with abdominal or pelvic cancer pain were divided into three groups and observed for 8 weeks. In group I, neurolytic celiac (NCPB) or superior hypogastric plexus block (SHPB), or lumbar sympathetic ganglion chain block (LSGCB) was performed with alcohol in patients using NSAID and a weak oral opioid or morphine (dose</=90 mg/day) and reporting VAS>/=4. In group II, NCPB, SHPB or LSGCB were performed on patients using NSAID and morphine (dose>/=90 mg/day) and reporting VAS>/=4. The patients of group III received pharmacological therapy only. The patients of groups I and II had a significant reduction of pain (P < 0.004), opioid consumption (P < 0.02) and a better quality of life (P < 0.006) than those of group III, but no significant differences between groups I and II were seen in these aspects. Opioid-related adverse effects were significantly greater in group III (P < 0.05). The occasional neurolysis-related complications were transitory.

CD008686,0,15273020,0,Vibroacoustic disease.,"Vibroacoustic disease (VAD) is a whole-body, systemic pathology, characterized by the abnormal proliferation of extra-cellular matrices, and caused by excessive exposure to low frequency noise (LFN). VAD has been observed in LFN-exposed professionals, such as, aircraft technicians, commercial and military pilots and cabin crewmembers, ship machinists, restaurant workers, and disk-jockeys. VAD has also been observed in several populations exposed to environmental LFN. This report summarizes what is known to date on VAD, LFN-induced pathology, and related issues. In 1987, the first autopsy of a deceased VAD patient was performed. The extent of LFN induced damage was overwhelming, and the information obtained is, still today, guiding many of the associated and ongoing research projects. In 1992, LFN-exposed animal models began to be studied in order to gain a deeper knowledge of how tissues respond to this acoustic stressor. In both human and animal models, LFN exposure causes thickening of cardiovascular structures. Indeed, pericardial thickening with no inflammatory process, and in the absence of diastolic dysfunction, is the hallmark of VAD. Depressions, increased irritability and aggressiveness, a tendency for isolation, and decreased cognitive skills are all part of the clinical picture of VAD. LFN is a demonstrated genotoxic agent, inducing an increased frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in both human and animal models. The occurrence of malignancies among LFN-exposed humans, and of metaplastic and displastic appearances in LFN-exposed animals, clearly corroborates the mutagenic outcome of LFN exposure. The inadequacy of currently established legislation regarding noise assessments is a powerful hindrance to scientific advancement.

CD008686,0,15261235,0,Surgical experience with resection en bloc of intramedullary astrocytomas and ependymomas in the cervical and cervicothoracic region.,"We performed 8 operations on 7 patients with benign intramedullary astrocytomas and ependymomas in the cervical and cervicothoracic region. All patients initially underwent gross total tumor resection en bloc. One patient with an astrocytoma showed tumor recurrence postoperatively, and underwent a second operation resulting in subtotal removal. The follow-up after the initial surgery ranged from 2.7 to 19.7 years (mean 8.5 years). Symptomatic improvement was observed in 6 patients after the initial operation. Two patients showed postoperative neurological deterioration, one with an ependymoma and the other after the second operation. No operative complications or deaths, nor postoperative respiratory dysfunction occurred. Benign intramedullary astrocytomas and ependymomas of the cervical and cervicothoracic spinal cord can be treated by radical resection en bloc with a low morbidity and recurrence, as well as acceptable outcomes. We describe here the surgical technique for en bloc tumor removal."

CD008686,0,15239354,0,Surgical evaluation and management of symptomatic lumbosacral meningeal cysts.,"Sacral meningeal cysts are a fairly common finding in the workup of sciatica. In most instances, a cyst causes no symptoms. Occasionally, a symptomatic sacral cyst may present with chronic low back pain (radiculopathy), sensory loss in sacral dermatomes, perineal pain, or bowel or bladder dysfunction. Compared with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging shows meningeal cysts more often and allows better localization of sacral cysts. In this article, we present clinical guidelines that may be used to distinguish symptomatic cysts from asymptomatic cysts. We conclude that surgical treatment of a symptomatic cyst may include laminectomy with fenestration and imbrication of the cyst--or percutaneous treatment methods. Surgery for sacral meningeal cysts can lead to successful improvement of pain and function in activities of daily living in more than 80% of cases."

CD008686,0,15221575,1,Spinal tumors in coexisting degenerative spine disease--a differential diagnostic problem.,"The clinical presentation of spinal tumors is known to vary, in many instances causing a delay in diagnosis and treatment, especially with benign tumors. Neck or back pain and sciatica, with or without neurological deficits, are mostly caused by degenerative spine and disc disease. Spinal tumors are rare, and the possibility of concurrent signs of degenerative changes in the spine is high. We report a series of ten patients who were unsuccessfully treated for degenerative spine disease. They were subsequently referred for operative treatment to our department, where an initial diagnosis of a tumor was made. Two patients had already been operated on for disc herniations, but without long-lasting effects. In eight patients the diagnosis of a tumor was made preoperatively. In two cases the tumor was found intraoperatively. All patients showed radiological signs of coexisting degenerative spine disease, making diagnosis difficult. MRI was the most helpful tool for diagnosing the tumors. A frequent symptom was back pain in the recumbent position. Other typical settings that should raise suspicion are persistent pain after disc surgery and neurological signs inconsistent with the level of noted degenerative disease. Tumor extirpation was successful in treating the main complaints in all but one patient. There was an incidence of 0.5% of patients in which a spinal tumor was responsible for symptoms thought to be of degenerative origin. However, this corresponds to 28.6% of all spine-tumor patients in this series. MRI should be widely used to exclude a tumor above the level of degenerative pathology."

CD008686,0,15221219,0,Radicular lower extremity pain as the first symptom of primary hyperparathyroidism.,"Clinical symptoms of hyperparathyroidism are generally nausea, vomiting, fatigue, constipation, and hypotonicity of the muscles and ligaments; bone pain and tenderness are also seen but are more common in secondary hyperparathyroidism. We report a histologically confirmed case of a 28-year-old man whose sole symptom of primary hyperparathyroidism was lower extremity radicular pain due to a vertebral brown tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated brown tumor to be hyperintense on T2-weighted and slightly hypointense on T1-weighted sequences; it showed intense contrast enhancement with gadolinium. Because brown tumors usually contain hemosiderin a short T2 should have been expected, but this was not seen in our case. Healing resulted in decreasing contrast enhancement on T1-weighted sequences and increasingly short T2. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a lumbar vertebral brown tumor associated with primary hyperparathyroidism."

Its use for the treatment of spinal lesions has been limited by the availability of effective target-immobilizing devices. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large doses of radiation near radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. The CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) is an image-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery system that allows for the radiosurgical treatment of spinal lesions.

Early diagnosis and treatment of bone loss are important interventions for the maintenance of bone health in cancer patients on hormone-depletion therapy. Identification of patients at risk for skeletal fracture is important for interventions that may reduce the incidence of disability and future fractures.

CD008686,0,15198130,0,Breakthrough pain characteristics and syndromes in patients with cancer pain. An international survey.,"Breakthrough pain (BKP) is a transitory flare of pain that occurs on a background of relatively well controlled baseline pain. Previous surveys have found that BKP is highly prevalent among patients with cancer pain and predicts more severe pain, pain-related distress and functional impairment, and relatively poor quality of life. An international group of investigators assembled by a task force of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) evaluated the prevalence and characteristics of BKP as part of a prospective, cross-sectional survey of cancer pain. Fifty-eight clinicians in 24 countries evaluated a total of 1095 patients with cancer pain using patient-rated items from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and observer-rated measures. The observer-rated information included demographic and tumor-related data, the occurrence of BKP, and responses on checklists of pain syndromes and pathophysiologies. The clinicians reported BKP in 64.8% of patients. Physicians from English-speaking countries were significantly more likely to report BKP than other physicians. BKP was associated with higher pain scores and functional interference on the BPI. Multivariate analysis showed an independent association of BKP with the presence of more than one pain, a vertebral pain syndrome, pain due to plexopathy, and English-speaking country. These data confirm the high prevalence of BKP, its association with more severe pain and functional impairment, and its relationship to specific cancer pain syndromes. Further studies are needed to characterize subtypes of BKP. The uneven distribution of BKP reporting across pain specialists from different countries suggests that more standardized methods for diagnosing BKP are needed."

Own cases and review of the literature.,"Although benign tumors and tumor-like lesions of the spine are shown in every orthopedic teaching book, it is often surprising how little attention is paid to the differential diagnosis and diagnostic investigations, respectively, since surgical treatment and postoperative control depends on exact diagnosis. Clinically the importance of this fact can not be over-emphasized. The most common complaint is pain, either local or radicular in nature. Bone deviations are diagnosed radiologically. Different types of benign bone tumors and tumor-like lesions of the spine including osteochondroma, osteoblastoma, osteoid osteoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, eosinophilic granuloma, hemangioma, and giant cell tumor, their appearance relation to the age and location in the spine were reviewed and the common histologic subtypes described. Clinical, laboratory and histopathologic findings, radiologic inclusive MRT and scintigraphic features are evaluated.

CD008686,0,15182796,0,Post-fracture osteolysis of the pubic bone simulating a malignancy: report of a case.,"Post-fracture osteolysis of the pubic bone is rare. We report a case of a 70-year-old woman with osteoporosis and a history of radiation therapy 2 years earlier. At presentation, she was found to have a bilateral sacral fracture and fractures of both pubic rami on one side. The pain persisted, and follow-up radiographs showed osteolysis of the pubic rami suggestive of metastatic disease. The development of a bony callus within 8 months established the diagnosis of benign osteolysis. About 50 cases of osteolysis at fracture sites have been reported to date, of which about a dozen occurred after radiation therapy. All the patients were elderly women with post-menopausal osteoporosis. Radiation therapy probably further increases the risk in this setting. The possibility of osteolysis at fracture sites in patients with osteoporosis should be borne in mind to avoid unnecessary and burdensome investigations that are costly and cause undue anxiety to the patients. Rest is the only effective treatment."

He had no other clinical manifestations. Findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging and spinal fluid formula from the first lumbar puncture were normal, but cerebrospinal fluid flow cytometry disclosed a kappa restriction monoclonal B-cell population, indicating malignant lymphoma. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis then revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes. Biopsy of an inguinal node showed findings consistent with Burkitt lymphoma. Within six weeks, intravenous and intrathecal chemotherapy resolved all neurologic findings except a partial right-side sixth nerve palsy and mild chin numbness. Eighteen months after disease onset, the patient remained in remission. Meningeal spread of Burkitt lymphoma is not commonly a presenting feature in immunocompetent adults. Chin numbness, a characteristic feature caused by infiltration of the mental nerve, should facilitate earlier recognition, which may be life saving."
CD008686,0,15177402,0,A rare case of metastatic renal cell carcinoma resembling a nerve sheath tumor of the cauda equina.,"We present a rare case of solitary metastasis to the cauda equina from the kidney. The patient was a 68-year-old man with a two-year history of low back pain. His past medical history revealed a renal cell carcinoma diagnosed seven years earlier. His lumbosacral MR imaging showed a well-demarcated, intradural extramedullary mass at the L3 level. He underwent an L2-4 laminectomy. The operative findings of the tumor quite resembled that of a nerve sheath tumor. It did not infiltrate into the subarachnoid space and involved only one spinal nerve. Pathology of the tumor was a metastasis of the renal cell carcinoma. Only 10 cases with such a metastasis to the cauda equina have been reported in the English literature. We added the 11th and reviewed the literature with reference to tumor pathologies, clinical findings and route of metastasis to the cauda equina."

More recently the patient presented with persistent headache and a slight limitation of neck motion. MRI studies of the cerebrum including the cervical spine showed a high cervical extradural tumor. Additional CT angiography showed a bony tumor suspected of being a spinal osteochondroma. An en bloc resection of the tumor was performed; histological evaluation confirmed the diagnosis. Immediately after intervention, all symptoms disappeared. In most patients with a spinal osteochondroma, the lesion causes no symptoms, or symptoms are aspecific. Therefore, there is often a significant delay between initial complaints and the diagnosis, as in the current case."

Implantable drug delivery systems (IDDS) administer small amounts of drugs directly to the spinal cord and reduce systemic narcotic exposure by a factor of 300 to one. In a large randomized trial of 202 patients with pain scores of 7.5 or higher, despite 200 mg or more of morphine or equivalent narcotics, IDDS gave better clinical success than comprehensive medical management (84.5% vs 70.8%, P=0.05). Pain scores were reduced by 52% versus 39%, drug toxicity scores were reduced by 50% versus 17%, and IDDS patients lived longer. Even the most refractory pain patients--those failed by a month of comprehensive medical management by experts--when subsequently provided with IDDS, had a 27% reduction in pain scores and a 50% reduction in drug side effects. Given multiple positive small cohort studies and a positive high-power randomized trial, IDDS should be considered as the best treatment for this population."
CD008686,0,15160515,0,Inter- and intraindividual variability in ketamine dosage in repetitive invasive procedures in children with malignancies.,"Midazolam/ketamine sedation has been used successfully in children undergoing painful invasive procedures. The authors prospectively assessed inter- and intra-individual variability in ketamine dosage for sedation in repetitive invasive procedures in children with malignancies. A total of 92 invasive procedures (58 lumbar punctures, 34 bone marrow biopsies; range: 2-9 procedures/patient) were performed on 25 children (median age: 12 years). Intravenous sedation consisted of 0.1 mg midazolam/kg and 0.5-1.0 mg ketamine/kg. Incremental dosages of ketamine (0.33 mg/kg) were given if necessary to achieve or maintain deep sedation. Primary outcome measure was the inter- and intraindividual ketamine dosage required to achieve adequate sedation; secondary outcome measures were the number of procedures with adequate sedation (Ramsay score of > 4), the number of adverse side effects, and the need for therapeutic interventions. All 92 invasive procedures were completed with satisfactory sedation levels in 88 procedures (95.7%). There was a great inter- and intraindividual variability in ketamine dosage required to achieve or maintain adequate sedation. In 12% of procedures side effects were seen, which required no or only minor interventions. Due to great inter- and intraindividual differences, ketamine dosage should be titrated toward the desired level of sedation. Thus, ketamine can be adjusted to the individual's need while achieving adequate sedation."
CD008686,0,15157684,0,Intrathecal opioid treatment for chronic non-malignant pain: a 3-year prospective study.,"Intrathecal (IT) opioid therapy is a treatment alternative for patients with severe chronic non-malignant pain. Several uncontrolled retrospective and prospective outcome studies have suggested a benefit in chronic non-malignant pain patients, but uncertainties about patient selection in these studies weaken the results. This study evaluated long-term outcome of IT opioid therapy in chronic non-malignant pain prospectively, and included two comparative groups to improve understanding of selection criteria and relative severity of intrathecal pump recipients (PRs). The study subjects included 38 PRs while the comparative groups included 31 intrathecal candidates who either had an unsuccessful trial, or declined the IT therapy, and another group of 41 newly referred patients. The following data were analyzed at study entry, and at 6 monthly intervals for a 3-year period: Symptom Check List 90 (SLC-90), SF-36 Health survey, Beck Depression Inventory, McGill Pain Questionnaire (short form), Oswestry Disability Index, Pain Drawings and Pain rating on visual analogue scale. Data analysis suggests the study group of PRs had improvements in pain, mood, and function from baseline to 36 months. These same parameters improved among new referrals (less severe patients receiving conservative pain management) while non-recipients significantly worsened. Although PRs improved, they were still worse off at 36 months than new referrals were at baseline. The study showed that when patients with extremely severe pain problems are selected as pump candidates, they will likely improve with the therapy, but their overall severity of pain and symptoms still remains high."

CD008686,0,15148512,0,[Complications in the evolution of haemangiomas and vascular malformations].,"The differentiation of haemangiomas and vascular malformations is histological, clinical and prognostic. Although the majority of haemangiomas evolve towards spontaneous resolution, as many as 10% of cases can develop complications with ulceration, pain and haemorrhaging. Besides, the localisation of haemangiomas in the head and neck, next to vital structures, can compromise their functions. Hence, compression of the airway might be a vital emergency. Periorbital haemangiomas can give rise to amblyopia due to sensory deprivation or due to a restrictive strabismus. Lumbosacral haemangiomas must be studied with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance because of their frequent association with alterations in the midline at the level of the spine, anus, genitals or kidneys. Amongst visceral haemangiomas, hepatic haemangiomas are the most serious due to their association with congestive cardiac insufficiency. The association of extensive facial haemangiomas with anomalies of the central nervous system, vascular, cardiac, ocular and sternal anomalies, is denominated PHACE syndrome and is frequently complicated by mental deficiency, convulsions or ictus. Vascular malformations of trigeminal localisation are associated in up to 15% of cases with glaucoma or choroidal or leptomeningeal haemangiomas (Sturge-Weber syndrome). Combined vascular malformations localised in the extremities can become complicated with thrombophlebitis, regional osteolysis and even distant thromboembolisms (Klippel-Treneaunay Syndrome). On the other hand, there is a coagulopathy due to consumption (Kassabach-Merrit Syndrome) that can complicate some vascular tumours such as the Kaposiform haemangioendothelioma and the tufted angioma. Finally, the complications of the treatments employed are reviewed."

Lymphoid malignancies have most commonly been associated with this syndrome while the first case in the literature of carcinoma associated with HIE syndrome was a squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, described by Clark et al. in 1998. We observed a male patient with Job's syndrome diagnosed at age three who presented with bone pain and a metastatic epithelial tumor of the bone revealed by biopsy. Diagnostic procedures aimed at detecting the primary site showed multiple mediastinal lymph nodes with lung and liver metastases on computed tomography scans and an extradural spinal metastasis at the upper thoracic level on magnetic resonance imaging. Although the patient refused a bronchoscopic procedure, a diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma was established on the basis of sputum cytology and the clinical aspects of tumor extent. Intravenous corticosteroids and palliative radiotherapy were given for the spinal metastasis. Palliative chemotherapy could not be started because of the patient's poor performance status as well as nosocomial fungal pneumonia and pseudomonal urogenital infection with bacteremia.

CD008686,0,15124026,0,Deletion of vanilloid receptor 1-expressing primary afferent neurons for pain control.,"Control of cancer, neuropathic, and postoperative pain is frequently inadequate or compromised by debilitating side effects. Inhibition or removal of certain nociceptive neurons, while retaining all other sensory modalities and motor function, would represent a new therapeutic approach to control severe pain. The enriched expression of transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1; also known as the vanilloid receptor, VR1) in nociceptive neurons of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia allowed us to test this concept. Administration of the potent TRPV1 agonist resiniferatoxin (RTX) to neuronal perikarya induces calcium cytotoxicity by opening the TRPV1 ion channel and selectively ablates nociceptive neurons. This treatment blocks experimental inflammatory hyperalgesia and neurogenic inflammation in rats and naturally occurring cancer and debilitating arthritic pain in dogs. Sensations of touch, proprioception, and high-threshold mechanosensitive nociception, as well as locomotor function, remained intact in both species. In separate experiments directed at postoperative pain control, subcutaneous administration of RTX transiently disrupted nociceptive nerve endings, yielding reversible analgesia. In human dorsal root ganglion cultures, RTX induced a prolonged increase in intracellular calcium in vanilloid-sensitive neurons, while leaving other, adjacent neurons unaffected. The results suggest that nociceptive neuronal or nerve terminal deletion will be effective and broadly applicable as strategies for pain management."

To better understand hemangioblastoma histogenesis, we analyzed postmortem CNS tissues from four patients with well-established diagnosis of VHL disease including development of characteristic tumors and positive family history. Numerous angiomesenchymal tumorlets, which resembled hemangioblastoma, but which also consistently showed distinct histological features, were distributed in the nerve roots, spinal cord, and cerebellum. Genetic analysis consistently showed deletion of the wild-type VHL allele in these tumorlets. Most angiomesenchymal tumorlets were in the dorsal nerve roots; the anterior roots and cerebellum were less frequently affected. Tumorlet distribution was highly consistent in the four cases. In analogy to the wide morphological spectrum of lesions known to exist in VHL kidneys, nerve roots appear to harbor more wide-spread and morphologically heterogeneous changes than previously appreciated. The abundance of tumorlets, associated with highly consistent morphology and topography, suggests a developmental origin of hemangioblastoma. Therefore, in VHL disease, inactivation of the VHL wild-type allele appears necessary, but not sufficient, for the formation of tumor that produces symptoms and neurological disability."

CD008686,0,15119943,0,The role of dorsal columns pathway in visceral pain.,"Traditionally, the dorsal column-medial lemniscus system has been viewed as a pathway not involved in pain perception. However, recent clinical and experimental studies have provided compelling evidence that implicates an important role of the dorsal column pathway in relaying visceral nociceptive information. Several clinical studies have shown that a small lesion that interrupts fibers of the dorsal columns (DC) that ascend close to the midline of the spinal cord significantly relieves pain and decreases analgesic requirements in patients suffering from cancer originating in visceral organs. Behavioral, electrophysiological and immunohistochemical methods used under experimental situations in animals showed that DC lesion lead to decreased activation of thalamic and gracile neurons by visceral stimuli, suppressed inhibition of exploratory activity induced by visceral noxious stimulation and prevented potentiation of visceromotor reflex evoked by colorectal distention under inflammatory conditions. Whereas the surgical lesion of the DC tract has proven to be clinically successful, a pharmacological approach would be a better strategy to block this pathway and thus to improve visceral pain conditions under less dramatic circumstances than cancer pain. Our finding that PSDC neurons start to express receptors for substance P after colon inflammation suggests new targets for the development of pharmacological strategies for the control of visceral pain."
CD008686,0,15117039,0,Results of radiotherapy in non round cell spinal metastasis.,"Spinal metastases are commonly encountered by physicians in a variety of clinical fields. There are some controversies in choice of treatment between surgery and radiotherapy. This report is a study of the outcomes of radiotherapy for metastatic nonround cell tumors of the spine. Medical records and films of 31 patients who were treated with radiotherapy at Songklanakarind Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The most common primary tumors were prostate and breast. One patient had spinal metastases from malignant serous cystadenoma of the fallopian tube of which no previous report has been published. This patient had excellent results after radiotherapy. Back and neck pain were the primary symptoms of the patients, while motor or sensory deficits (or both) were found in 58 per cent of the cases. Seven patients had neurological recovery and 18 patients had pain relief after radiotherapy. Cause of compression is the only factor effecting the result from univariate and multivariate analysis. Spinal cord compressed by a tumor had a better recovery than those which were compressed by a bony fragment or intervertebral disc. The authors concluded that radiotherapy remains a good treatment for patient with non round cell spinal metastasis. Cause of spinal cord compression is the only factor predicting the result of treatment."

By far the most pain from discs, facet and sacroiliac joints, ligaments and muscles must be considered as unspecific, because no anamnestic information or clinical signs exist (radiological changes included) to assign pain to structural or functional correlates. In addition, the therapeutic consequences from the assignment of structural changes to pain remain unclear. In acute pain situations the specificity of the pain is not important because of the fast relief of the disease, in chronic pain situations, fear avoidance beliefs and pain behaviour seem to be much more important than structural and functional changes."

Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HM) affects 10 to 20% of patients with advanced cancer. HM causes a series of symptoms, constipation, nausea and vomiting, confusion and/or stupor, polyuria and polydipsia, bone pains, which decrease quality of life. The normalization of calcemia significantly improves all these symptoms. Despite that, HM remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. HM is an emergency. Treatment of HM includes rapid rehydration of isotonic saline and i.v. bisphosphonates. Complications from metastatic bone disease include pathological fracture, HM, spinal cord compression, bone marrow infiltration, pain, and reduced mobility. Treatment with bisphosphonates are effective to reduce these complications. They should be started when bone metastases are diagnosed and continue until it is no longer clinically relevant. The most currently used bisphosphonates were clodronate and pamidronate. The increase convenience of a 15 minutes infusion, the greater efficacy and longer duration of response makes zoledronate the standard of care for HM and metastatic bone disease."

CD008686,0,15081130,0,Spinal tumors.,"Spinal tumors are uncommon lesions but may cause significant morbidity in terms of limb dysfunction. In establishing the differential diagnosis for a spinal lesion, location is the most important feature, but the clinical presentation and the patient's age and gender are also important. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays a central role in the imaging of spinal tumors, easily allowing tumors to be classified as extradural, intradural-extramedullary or intramedullary, which is very useful in tumor characterization. In the evaluation of lesions of the osseous spine both computed tomography (CT) and MR are important. We describe the most common spinal tumors in detail. In general, extradural lesions are the most common with metastasis being the most frequent. Intradural tumors are rare, and the majority is extramedullary, with meningiomas and nerve sheath tumors being the most frequent. Intramedullary tumors are uncommon spinal tumors. Astrocytomas and ependymomas comprise the majority of the intramedullary tumors. The most important tumors are documented with appropriate high quality CT or MR images and the characteristics of these tumors are also summarized in a comprehensive table. Finally we illustrate the use of the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification of neoplasms affecting the central nervous system."
CD008686,0,15077648,0,Common animal models for spasticity and pain.,"Animal models of spasticity and pain have allowed for the elucidation of possible mechanisms and the evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions for these serious clinical problems. Each model mirrors the clinical appearance of many features of the syndrome, but few reproduce the myriad patient reports of either intensity or relevant contributing factors, especially in models of chronic neuropathic pain. Often these models have been used to predict the potency and efficacy of pharmacologic agents that work in human pain states. Pain models have relied on measurements of the shifts in behavioral hypersensitivity to tactile and thermal stimuli, tests that are not used quantitatively in human patients. Even with the multiple peripheral and central models of spasticity and pain used in animals, only a few actually test human conditions: namely, diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for tumors. However, all these models have allowed for the comparison of certain behavioral, cellular, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms with human patient populations. Here we review the few extant models of spasticity, nerve injury, and central injury models of pain, and describe their features and use."
CD008686,0,15074582,0,Synovial excrescences and cysts of the spine: clinicopathological features and contributions to spinal stenosis.,"Synovial cysts occur throughout the body and are generally benign lesions with limited clinical consequences. Juxtafacet cysts of the spine, in contrast, often press on a nerve root as it exits in the foramen, causing radiculopathy. Synovial tissue that emanates from the facet joint but extends medially, is an additional important cause of spinal stenosis. Over the past 5 years, neurosurgeons at our institution have operated on a large number of patients with back pain, with removal of abnormal synovial tissues. Histological examination of these tissues distinguishes the different types of pathologic processes responsible for producing symptoms. Juxtafacet cysts may be either mucin-filled ganglion cysts devoid of cyst lining or true synovial cysts with watery content and lined by synovial cells. Ganglion cysts arise in degenerated ligament at the facet joint, and occasionally within synovial stroma. Synovial cysts arise within synovium and, unlike synovial cysts in the extremities, have a thick wall containing granulation tissue, numerous histiocytes and giant cells. This hyperplastic, irritated synovium of the spine, which we term ""synovial excrescences"", is voluminous and this reactive part overshadows the cystic portion of the lesion in most instances. Iron pigment deposition and inflammation are mild to absent, making synovial excrescences different from pigmented villonodular synovitis. Synovial excrescences of the spine are an important cause of spinal stenosis, predominantly in elderly patients. Surgical removal of excrescences protruding into the spinal canal provides prompt and durable relief of symptoms, usually without the need for extensive bony laminectomy or spinal fusion. Several patients in our study had both spinal ganglion cysts and synovial excrescences, suggesting common risk factors for both lesions."

CD008686,0,15062713,0,Diagnostic evaluation of low back pain.,"The diagnostic evaluation of chronic LBP is at best a complex and involved undertaking. The most important part of the process lies in the knowledge of the patient and a solid history and physical examination. From there, most of the serious and life-threatening causes of LBP can be elucidated and studies may be used for confirmation. Imaging studies are used most practically as confirmation studies once a working diagnosis is determined. MRI, although excellent at defining tumor, infection, and nerve compression, can be too sensitive with regard to degenerative disease findings and commonly displays pathology that is not responsible for the patient's symptoms. As an example, the high-intensity zones (HIZ) seen on MRI are reliable in determining annular defects in the disc but are not reliable in establishing internal disc disruption as the cause of LBP. Discography is the primary tool used by many physicians to determine the true pain generator when discogenic LBP is suspected. Because the reliability of the patient response is fundamental to discography, interpreting the test in different settings must be considered. In individuals with disc degeneration and annular defects, discography may elicit LBP with injection whether the patient is symptomatic with serious LBP or not. The pain response may be amplified in those subjects with issues of chronic pain, social stressors, such as secondary gain or litigation claims, or psychologic distress disorder. These factors have been shown experimentally to be associated with an increased risk for a false positive injection. The ability of an individual to differentiate the true site of LBP by the quality of sensation with disc injection (concordancy) of pain produced by the injected disc also may not be reliable. In fact, individuals may not have the neural discrimination to differentiate sclerotomal pain originating from different sites in the low back and pelvis. One may realize that chronic LBP illness may not stem from a mechanical spinal disorder alone. In fact, the mechanical pathology may be just a portion of the problem with amplification by neurophysiologic, social, and psychologic issues. Chronic disabling LBP commonly is confounded by chronic pain, emotional troubles, poor job satisfaction, alcohol and narcotic abuse, and compensation issues, just to identify a few. It would follow that expecting to identify a single cause for this symptom complex is impractical and any single test may not be a reasonable approach. Furthermore, surgical correction of the mechanical portion of chronic LBP. even if correctly identified, then can be expected only to relieve a portion of a patient's symptoms as long as the confounding issues continue to be significant or have become life long adaptive mechanisms. In the end, the discogram and other diagnostic tests are tools that have clear limitations. In this field, clinical judgment begins and ends with an understanding of a patient's life and circumstances as much as with their specific spinal pathology."
CD008686,0,15062527,0,Headaches and brain tumors.,"A careful history and physical examination remain the most important aspects of headache assessment. enabling the neurologist to decide if any further studies are necessary. Only a minority of patients who have headaches have brain tumors; however, recognition of the headaches characteristically associated with tumors is most important. Some locations are more likely to produce headache (eg, a posterior fossa tumor causes headache more often than a supratentorial tumor). Rapidly growing tumors are more likely to be associated with headache. Uncommon headache presentations can occur with tumors, includin paroxysmal cough, cluster headache, and TACs. The classic brain tumor headache is not as common as a tension-type presentation or migraine. Patients who have prior primary headaches may have more headache symptoms if they have a tumor and of course they still have their primary headache disorder. Mass lesions progress and inevitably develop other symptoms and signs besides headache, and these new symptoms and signs must be sought and found. Metastatic leptomeningeal involvement can present with headache and spinal pain in the neck and back. Imaging of headache patients for tumors, if they have primary headache disorders, such as migraine and typical cluster, generally is not cost effective but is necessary if there are any atypical features. Treatment of headache in patients who have metastatic brain tumors should be aggressive in terms of pain and symptoms control. Treatment of primary CNS tumors is dictated by the kind of neoplasm and site, but control of headache should not be ignored."
CD008686,0,15061819,0,Post-herpetic neuralgia case study: optimizing pain control.,"Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic pain syndrome associated with the reactivation of a primary infection with varicella zoster virus (chicken pox), which leads to a chronic infection of the dorsal root ganglia. Under various clinical circumstances, including immunosuppressive diseases or treatments and certain cancers, reactivation of the infection can occur in adults as shingles. Other factors such as psychological distress and stressful life events also appear to play a role in the onset of shingles and the development of PHN. The most common risk factor for shingles and its potential sequela, PHN, is advanced age. For a significant number of patients, the pain following healing of shingles can persist for months to years; this pain is classified as PHN if it persists longer than 3 months. PHN often leads to depression, disrupted sleep, decreased functioning and increased healthcare utilization. Prompt use of antiviral therapy appears to reduce the period of pain following an episode of shingles by about half and may possibly reduce the overall incidence of PHN. Damage to a variety of neurologic pathways as a result of herpes zoster reactivation suggests that intervention with multiple agents having divergent mechanisms of action is an appropriate treatment approach. Current treatment options aimed at relieving the symptoms of PHN include antidepressants, opioids, anticonvulsants and topical analgesics. It is important for the clinician to establish a baseline pain intensity and character as well as quality of life measures against which to judge the effectiveness of any treatment. This review article features a case study of a patient with PHN to illustrate current diagnostic and treatment approaches."
CD008686,0,15060776,0,[Surgical treatment of osseous metastases of the pelvis].,"Metastases are the most frequent malignant tumors of the skeleton. Breast cancer is the most frequent primary tumor with osseous metastases followed by renal cell carcinomas, bronchial carcinomas, and thyroid tumors. The predominant localization of bone metastases is the spine, followed by the pelvis, femur, ribs, skull, sternum, and humerus. The overall incidence of bone metastases has increased due to improved diagnosis, prolonged survival by adjuvant therapy, and improved follow-up. Osseous metastases of the pelvis are usually diagnosed only late in the course of the disease because of their considerable delayed onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, treatment is usually focused on a palliative approach to reduce pain and to improve the quality of life. We introduce three patients with bronchial, renal cell, and cholangiocellular carcinoma in an incurable tumor stage with osseous metastases in the pelvis. The metastatic osteolyses caused pain and symptoms of instability. Despite high doses of opiate analgesics, the patients were neither free of pain nor could they be mobilized. The palliative treatment included preoperative tumor embolization followed by tumor resection and implantation of a hip prosthesis. The preoperative embolization reduced intraoperative bleeding and made tumor resection, osteosynthesis, and implantation of the hip prosthesis possible. Mobilization with moderate pain could be achieved in these three patients for the rest of their lives."

The clinical files of 634 patients with prostate cancer seen in a comprehensive cancer center during a 4-year period were retrospectively reviewed. One hundred nineteen patients (18.8%) had 212 significant episodes of osseous spinal metastases. Pain was nearly universal (93%), and motor and bladder impairment occurred in 25% and 3.1% of patients, respectively. Bone scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in 197 and 64 episodes, respectively. Fifteen episodes of spinal cord compression were treated surgically. Other treatments included hormonal therapy (163 episodes), chemotherapy (70 episodes), and radiation therapy (103 episodes). Osteolytic lesions were observed alone and in combination with osteoblastic pattern in 18% and 26% of episodes, respectively. Bone scan was the most effective screening procedure of vertebral involvement, and MRI effectively showed epidural involvement. Overall treatment led to improvements in pain and motor impairment in 77% and 50% of patients, respectively. However, clinical episodes were recurrent (1.78 episodes per patient; range, 1-8). Median survival after vertebral metastasis episode was 14 months compared with only 4 months after surgery for spinal cord compression. Vertebral metastases strongly alter quality of life in patients with prostate cancer. Pain and neurologic complications are the major problems. Careful early screening with bone scan and MRI may help to define better treatment strategy. However, further prospective studies of clinical management are needed to determine the optimal timing of radiation therapy, medical treatments, and surgery."

Twenty-five patients (mean age: 59 years) underwent chemoembolization of symptomatic lytic lesions involving the spinal column (n=10), iliac bone and sacrum (n=15). The study design consisted of at least three procedures based on combined chemoembolization performed under analog-sedation. Therapeutic agents were carboplatin for selective chemotherapy and pirarubicin mixed with polyvinyl alcohol foam for chemoembolization. Fifteen of 18 (83%) patients had significant pain relief, as shown by the decrease of analgesic drug use. Mean clinical response duration was 12 months. Radiologically, ten patients were stable. A partial response was observed in four patients, while a complete response was seen in two others. Selective intra-arterial chemoembolization gives longer pain relief than embolization, compared to the literature data, probably because of partial response with local anti-cancer drugs."

He had long-standing insulin-dependent diabetes with previously good glycaemic control. Intense headaches and vomiting initiated hospitalization. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan was normal, and a lumbar puncture showed elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein [0.67 g/L; normal range (NR) 0.15-0.45 g/L], suggesting resolving viral meningitis. Routine thyroid function tests were abnormal (free thyroxine 10.6 pmol/L, NR 9-22.5 pmol/L; thyroid-stimulating hormone 0.16 mU/L, NR 0.35-5 mU/L). In the absence of evident thyroid therapy, the laboratory policy required an urgent cortisol assay to be added; this was very abnormal (42 nmol/L), suggesting hypopituitarism. Later analysis showed that concentrations of gonadotrophins and adrenocorticotrophin were low. An urgent pituitary magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed an unsuspected pituitary tumour with recent haemorrhage (pituitary apoplexy). The patient was given intravenous hydrocortisone and then stabilized on oral hydrocortisone, thyroxine and mesterolone. He made a full recovery and the hypoglycaemia resolved. The normal brain CT scan was falsely reassuring and the CSF protein was not due to viral meningitis but to haemorrhage into the pituitary tumour. If laboratory policy had not required the urgent cortisol assay be added, the diagnosis of hypopituitarism would have been delayed or even missed altogether. This could have led to the death of the patient."

Thus far, a number of products in the form of TCM cataplasma became commercially available in the market, and clinical investigations with these products indicated that topically applicable herbal preparations, especially in the form of cataplasma, are preferred formulations with respect to the treatment comfort of the patient. Compared to the traditional preparations which utilize rubber and rosin as adhesives, cataplasma is advantageous in that the lipophilic and hydrophilic ingredients of the herbal extracts are solubilized and then ""gellified"" with the organic polymers, and that the drug matrix containing up to 40%-70% of water serves as a ""drug reservoir"" that will sustain the quick and continuous release of herbal ingredients over several days across the skin. While there are conventional remedies for palliation of pain and discomfort associated with bone diseases or cancers, administration of oral medicinal herbs combined with topical agents such as TCM cataplasma may significantly alleviate the symptoms and improve their quality of life. This article provides a review on three aspects, which include the process development, characteristics and developmental status of TCM cataplasma, and future development of such a technology."

CD008686,0,14997065,0,Vascular birthmarks: a care study of an infant with haemangioma.,"This care study describes the application of an evidence-based approach to the care of an infant with a sacral haemangioma. It explores four key aspects of management: specific therapeutic modalities; local wound management; pain management; and management of infection. Clinical governance and evidence-based practice are now important elements of care delivery in the NHS (Department of Health (DoH), 1997). Current evidence relating to haemangiomas and wound management is critically appraised and applied to an individual patient within the primary care setting. The appropriateness of theories and models of nursing are considered in relation to holistic assessment. Recent evidence regarding the management of pain at dressing change (Moffatt et al, 2002) and its relevance to haemangiomas are highlighted. Reflective practice is an integral part of experiential learning and the development of practical knowledge (Ghaye, 2000). Reflective practice and critical analysis have facilitated the provision of high-quality care and allowed a deeper and clearer understanding of both practice and theory, and their relationship within clinical practice. It is concluded that reflective practice aids the delivery of high-quality care at a personal, professional and practice development level."

CD008686,0,14995949,0,Treatment of neuropathic cancer pain with continuous intrathecal administration of S +-ketamine.,"The effective treatment of patients suffering from neuropathic cancer pain remains a clinical challenge. When patients experience either insufficient analgesia or problematic side-effects after opioid administration, intrathecal administration of morphine and other medications such as bupivacaine and clonidine may offer significant advantages. Additionally, ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-Aspartate-receptor antagonist is able to alter pain perception at the spinal level. Because of the potential neurotoxicity after neuraxial use of racemic ketamine, intrathecal administration of the preservative-free active compound, S (+)-ketamine may be a valuable alternative. In this paper, we present a patient with severe neuropathic cancer pain successfully treated by continuous intrathecal infusion of morphine, bupivacaine, clonidine and S (+)-ketamine. Moreover, quality of life measurements before and 3 weeks after the start of spinal treatment revealed an improvement in pain relief and a higher overall quality of life. No clinical signs of neurologic deficit were observed during spinal treatment with S (+)-ketamine. However, the continuous intrathecal administration of S (+)-ketamine should be considered as the last resort because there are no preclinical safety data with relevant concentrations on intrathecal use of S (+)-ketamine."
CD008686,0,14991241,0,Omission of bone scanning according to staging guidelines leads to futile therapy in non-small cell lung cancer.,"The leading European and American professional societies recommend that bone scans (BS) should be performed in the staging of lung cancer only in those patients with bone pain. This prospective study investigated the sensitivity of conventional skeletal scintigraphy in detecting osseous metastases in patients with lung cancer and addressed the potential consequences of failure to use this method in the work-up of asymptomatic patients. Subsequent to initial diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, 100 patients were examined and questioned regarding skeletal complaints. Two specialists in internal medicine decided whether they would recommend a bone scan on the basis of the clinical evaluation. Skeletal scintigraphy was then performed blinded to the findings of history and physical examination. The combined results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the vertebral column, positron emission tomography (PET) of skeletal bone and the subsequent clinical course served as the gold standard for the identification of osseous metastases. Bone scintigraphy showed an 87% sensitivity in the detection of bone metastases. Failure to perform skeletal scintigraphy in asymptomatic patients reduced the sensitivity of the method, depending on the interpretation of the symptoms, to 19-39%. Without the findings of skeletal scintigraphy and the gold standard methods, 14-22% of patients would have undergone unnecessary surgery or neoadjuvant therapy. On this basis it is concluded that bone scans should not be omitted in asymptomatic patients."

CD008686,0,14975415,0,Atypical presentations of conus medullaris and filum terminale myxopapillary ependymomas.,"Out of 27 cases of spinal ependymomas seen during a 21 year period (1978-1999), we observed three out of 12 myxopapillary tumours of the conus medullaris and filum terminale with atypical presentations. All the three cases presented with subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracranial hypertension. In addition, the second patient developed persistently low CSF sugar, while the third patient developed hydrocephalus, acute autonomic crisis and SIADH. Although subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), intracranial hypertension and hydrocephalus were previously scarcely reported in the literature, the low CSF sugar, acute autonomic crisis and SIADH were never reported singly or in combination. Up to our best knowledge, this is the first report that clearly outlines all these atypical manifestations in this particularly interesting neoplasm. Hence, the above challenging clinical presentations should be borne in mind with cryptic presentations of lower spinal cord and filum terminale ependymomas. A proposal of the mechanism of their production is suggested."
CD008686,0,14973242,0,Specific Inhibition of IkappaB kinase reduces hyperalgesia in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models in rats.,"Phosphorylation of IkappaB through IkappaB kinase (IKK) is the first step in nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and upregulation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes. Hence, inhibition of IKK activity may be expected to prevent injury-, infection-, or stress-induced upregulation of various proinflammatory genes and may thereby reduce hyperalgesia and inflammation. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis using a specific and potent IKK inhibitor (S1627). In an IKK assay, S1627 inhibited IKK activity with an IC50 value of 10.0 +/- 1.2 nm. In cell culture experiments, S1627 inhibited interleukin (IL)-1beta-stimulated nuclear translocation and DNA-binding of NF-kappaB. Plasma concentration time courses after intraperitoneal injection revealed a short half-life of 2.8 hr in rats. Repeated intraperitoneal injections were, therefore, chosen as the dosing regimen. S1627 reversed thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia at 3x 30 mg/kg in the zymosan-induced paw inflammation model and reduced the inflammatory paw edema at 3x 40 mg/kg. S1627 also significantly reduced tactile and cold allodynia in the chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain at 30 mg/kg once daily. The drug had no effect on acute inflammatory nociception in the formalin test and did not affect responses to heat and tactile stimuli in naive animals. As hypothesized, S1627 prevented the zymosan-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in the spinal cord and the upregulation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes including cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-1beta. Our data indicate that IKK may prove an interesting novel drug target in the treatment of pathological pain and inflammation."

CD008686,0,14963752,0,Syringomyelia caused by cervical spondylosis.,"Syringomyelia is generally associated with Chiari type malformations, spinal tumors, or spinal trauma. Cervical spondylosis is only rarely involved. We here present a case of a 64-year-old woman with severe radicular pain in the right arm and the syringomyelic syndrome. Lateral radiographs of the cervical spine demonstrated spondylotic change at the C4/5 and C6/7 levels, and instability at C4/5. Dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed the spinal cord to be compressed at C5 and C6 with the body in extension, and the syrinx extended from C2 to the Th3 level on sagittal images. It was reduced remarkably after anterior decompression and stabilization at C4/5 and C6/7, and her symptoms also improved after surgery. We concluded that the syrinx in this case might have developed due to craniospinal pressure dissociation caused by intermittent spinal cord compression."

CD008686,0,14870766,0,Management of metastatic spinal cord compression.,"Metastatic spinal cord compression, diagnosed in 3-7% of cancer patients, is one of the most dreaded complications of metastatic cancer. It is an oncologic emergency, which must be diagnosed early and treated promptly to achieve the best results and avoid progressive pain, paralysis, sensory loss and sphincter incontinence. Patients who are ambulatory at the time of the diagnosis have a higher probability of obtaining good response to treatment and a longer survival. In clinical practice, back pain accompanies metastatic spinal cord compression in most cases, even in patients with no neurologic deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best tool for diagnosing metastatic spinal cord compression and is able to identify spinal cord compression in 32-35% patients with back pain, bone metastases and normal neurologic examination. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging gives the extension of the lesion, can diagnose other unsuspected clinical metastatic spinal cord compression sites, and is useful for the radiation oncologist in defining the target volume. Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in most cases, whereas surgery is advised only in selected patients (ie, if stabilization is necessary, if radiotherapy has already been given in the same area, when vertebral body collapse causes bone impingement on the cord or nerve roots, when there are diagnostic doubts, or when computed tomography-guided percutaneous vertebral biopsy cannot be performed). Laminectomy should be abandoned in favor of more aggressive surgery (ie, posterior, anterior, and/or lateral approach, tumor mass resection, and stabilization of the spine). Generally, radiotherapy must be administered 7-10 days after surgery. The optimal radiation schedule has not been defined. However, as recently suggested by some clinical trials, even the hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens are effective and can be used without increasing radiation-induced myelopathy. Moderate doses of dexamethasone should be used in the early phases of therapy. After radiotherapy, spinal recurrence is generally found in sites different from the first compression area. A close post-treatment follow-up is suggested using clinical parameters (pain, motor and sphincter function), and magnetic resonance imaging should be performed only when a second metastatic spinal cord compression and/or myelopathy are clinically suspected."

We report a case of a MPNST of the proximal sciatic nerve in the thigh, unassociated with pre-existing type 1 neurofibromatosis or history of radiation therapy. A 71-year-old man had a 6 month history of constant, severe, burning pain affecting the sole of the left foot. One month after the onset, the pain radiated to the left calf, posterior aspect of the thigh and buttock, and distal leg weakness followed. Three months prior to admission, the patient developed a large and painful mass in the buttock, that occupied the entire left gluteal region on examination. There was severe weakness of ankle and toe dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, decreased sensation on the lateral and posterior aspect of the left leg as well as on the dorsal and plantar surfaces of the foot, and absent ankle jerk. EMG showed denervation and motor unit loss in the short head of biceps femoris and muscles supplied by tibial and peroneal nerves on the left side. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 10-cm enhancing mass of the left sciatic nerve from the upper thigh to the greater sciatic notch. In surgery, a large MPNST with a high Ki67 labeling index (> 60 %) was subtotally removed from the sciatic nerve, and adjuvant radiation therapy was administered. In the ensuing months the tumor invaded the entire pelvic region. A high sciatic malignant tumor can present with a rapidly growing buttock mass and unilateral, neuropathic foot pain imitating the tarsal tunnel syndrome."

Both procedures are successfully used for pain-relieving stabilizations of osteoporotic fractures or malignant processes. Advantages of kyphoplasty over vertebroplasty are to be seen in the possibility of deformity correction as well as in a decreased risk of cement extrusions which represent the most important potential for clinical complications. Long-term experiences with the effect of cementing are sparse. Thus it seems even more important, to judge indications and possibilities realistically. The decision whether and when to perform an augmentation is influenced by multiple factors. These include age of the patient, age of the fracture, degree of deformation and further degenerative changes of the spine. This article summarizes the present research and literature und is thought to provide guidelines for the aforementioned decision making processes."

Fifteen consecutive patients (7 men, 8 women), with a mean age of 51 years (range, 36-79 years), underwent transperitoneal fenestration of simple renal cysts (SRC) at our institution from 1994 to 2001. Data were collected by reviewing patients' clinical files, conducting telephone interviews regarding symptoms, and followup renal ultrasonography (US). There were 15 symptomatic cysts (10 parenchymal, 5 peripelvic) ranging in diameter from 3.5 to 20 cm (mean, 8 cm). All patients had lumbar pain and in four (26.6%) the collecting system was compressed by the cysts. Fenestration was carried out laparoscopically in all patients. There was no mortality and no postoperative complications were recorded. No malignancies were detected at final histopathology. Mean length of stay was 2.5 days. All patients were available for long-term followup. At a mean of 60 months (range, 22-93 months) from surgery, three patients (20%) complained of slight discomfort in the lumbar area not requiring any analgesic. No recurrence of the cysts was seen on US. Two asymptomatic patients (13.3%) developed additional cysts originating from sites different than the one operated on.

His toes were bluish, erythematous, and swollen. Neither oral administration of vitamin E for 2 weeks nor wearing insulated socks improved the clinical manifestations. Peripheral blood examination revealed the presence of a large number of monocytic atypical cells and myeloblasts, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. In the bone marrow, monocytic cells were elevated, and myelocytic atypical cells were observed. Chromosomal analysis demonstrated Philadelphia chromosome. We diagnosed him as having a blast crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). A biopsy specimen of the skin from the chilblain-like eruption showed infiltration of large, atypical, mononuclear cells; most of them were positive for CD68, and some of them were positive for CD14. Therefore, we concluded that the chilblain-like eruptions on his toes were specific skin lesions of a blast crisis in CML."

The histopathologic findings of the lesion revealed diffuse infiltration of atypical T-lymphocytes. The titers of anti-HTLV-I antibody and serum soluble IL-2 receptor were elevated. The diagnosis of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) infiltrating the terminal ileum was made. Combination chemotherapy including VEPA-M was undertaken, and resulted in a partial response. ATLL became refractory about June 2000. Flaccid paralysis, dysesthesia in the left lower limb and bladder-bowel disturbance emerged in a few days, July 2000. T2-weighed MRCT images demonstrated that a lesion with a high intensity signal was present in the spinal cord around Th 7. Flower-like cells were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid.

CD008686,0,14662726,0,"A nitric oxide (NO)-releasing derivative of gabapentin, NCX 8001, alleviates neuropathic pain-like behavior after spinal cord and peripheral nerve injury.","1. Nitric oxide (NO) participates, at least in part, to the establishment and maintenance of pain after nerve injury. Therefore, drugs that target the NO/cGMP signaling pathway are of interest for the treatment of human neuropathic pain. Various compounds endowed with NO-releasing properties modulate the expression and function of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), the key enzyme responsible for sustained NO production under pathological conditions including neuropathic pain. 2. With this background, we synthesized a new chemical entity, [1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexane acetic acid 3-(nitroxymethyl)phenyl ester] NCX8001, which has a NO-releasing moiety bound to gabapentin, a drug currently used for the clinical management of neuropathic pain. We examined the pharmacological profile of this drug with respect to its NO-releasing properties in vitro as well as to its efficacy in treating neuropathic pain conditions (allodynia) consequent to experimental sciatic nerve or spinal cord injuries. 3. NCX8001 (1-30 microm) released physiologically relevant concentrations of NO as it induced a concentration-dependent activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (EC(50)=5.6 microm) and produced consistent vasorelaxant effects in noradrenaline-precontracted rabbit aortic rings (IC(50)=1.4 microm). 4. NCX8001, but not gabapentin, counteracted in a concentration-dependent fashion lipopolysaccharide-induced overexpression and function of iNOS in RAW264.7 macrophages cell line. Furthermore, NCX8001 also inhibited the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) from stimulated RAW264.7 cells. 5. NCX8001 (28-280 micromol x kg(-1), i.p.) reduced the allodynic responses of spinal cord injured rats in a dose-dependent fashion while lacking sedative or motor effects. In contrast, gabapentin (170-580 micromol x kg(-1), i.p.) resulted less effective and elicited marked side effects. 6. NCX8001 alleviated the allodynia-like responses of rats to innocuous mechanical or cold stimulation following lesion of the sciatic nerve. This effect was not shared by equimolar doses of gabapentin. 7. Potentially due to the slow releasing kinetics of NO, NCX8001 alleviated pain-like behaviors in two rat models of neuropathic pain in a fashion that is superior to its parent counterpart gabapentin. This new gabapentin derivative, whose mechanism deserves to be explored further, offers new hopes to the treatment of human neuropathic pain."
CD008686,0,14662000,0,Bisphosphonate therapy in the oncology setting.,"Patients with metastatic cancer and bone involvement are at chronic risk of skeletal complications, including bone pain, fractures, spinal cord compression and hypercalcaemia of malignancy. Therapies targeting the primary malignancy are often unable to prevent skeletal complications, which often require orthopaedic surgery, radiation therapy and analgesics. Intravenous bisphosphonates can reduce the risk of skeletal complications and the requirement for palliative radiation therapy. Since its broad regulatory approval, zoledronic acid (ZOMETA, Novartis Pharma AG/Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation) 4 mg by 15-minute intravenous infusion has become widely used to treat bone metastases from all solid tumours and is becoming the standard of care for advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma.

Biological tests and X-rays were not informative, but technetium scintigraphy revealed a high level of left sacroiliac tracer binding. Several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and sulfasalazine treatment were given over 3 months but ineffective. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed an osteolytic tumor of the sacrum. Biopsy suggested a malignant fibrosarcoma, but complete evaluation after surgical resection demonstrated an inflammatory pseudotumor. All clinical symptoms disappeared within a few days after surgery, which is suggestive of a paraneoplastic syndrome. No relapse has occurred after 4 years."
CD008686,0,14651087,0,CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy in spine lesions.,"Vertebral bone biopsy is an accurate, rapid, and cost-effective method to diagnose benign and malignant spine lesions. The major complications are uncommon. Nondiagnostic or insufficient specimens are encountered in less than ten per cent. The accuracy of the biopsy depends on the location and type of the lesion, needle system, and biopsy route. The major indications are focal lesions with non-specific medical imaging findings, to exclude metastasis in patients with known primary malignancy, lesion without response to treatment, no clinical improvement in children with diskitis after six weeks of therapy to exclude occult tumor and extreme pain due to vertebral collapse. If histology yields only peripheral blood elements in an obviously destructive mass, biopsy can be repeated, by directing at a slightly different area of the lesion. No more than three percutaneous biopsies of the same lesion should be performed."

CD008686,0,14649556,0,Neurofibromatosis 2 in the pediatric population.,"Neurofibromatosis 2 is a severe autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the occurrence of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other benign tumors of the nervous system. Excellent natural history studies exist for adults with neurofibromatosis 2, but limited outcome data are available for children with neurofibromatosis 2. In this study, we present clinical data on 12 patients with neurofibromatosis 2 and age at diagnosis before 18 years. Full record review included surgical reports, pathology reports, and imaging studies; all patients were personally examined by a single author. One third of the patients presented with hearing impairment and another third presented with other cranial nerve dysfunction. Tumor load was extensive, including cranial meningiomas in 75%, cranial schwannomas other than vestibular schwannomas in 83%, and spinal cord tumors in 75%. Family history was present in two thirds of the patients. Surgical removal of vestibular schwannomas was performed in 58%; none had full preservation of hearing postsurgery. Functionally, 75% of children had hearing loss, 83% had visual impairment, 25% had abnormal ambulation, and 25% were performing below grade level. In conclusion, increased clinical awareness, better imaging techniques, and molecular diagnostics have made pediatric diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 2 feasible, but outcomes appear to be worse than in adult patients. Further work is needed to determine optimal management of pediatric neurofibromatosis 2."

Patients with refractory cancer pain or uncontrollable side effects were enrolled at 17 US and international sites in this prospective, open-label study. Pain relief, reduction in systemic opioid use, and reduction in opioid-related complications were analyzed both individually and together as a measure of overall success. One hundred forty-nine patients were enrolled and 119 were implanted. Average numeric analog scale pain decreased from 6.1 to 4.2 at 1 month and was maintained through month 7 (P <.01) and through month 13 (P <.05). Systemic opioid use was significantly decreased throughout the study (P <.01). Significant reduction in the opioid complication severity index was demonstrated at all 4 follow-up visits (P <.01). Overall success (>/=50% reduction in numeric analog scale pain, use of systemic opioids, or opioid complication severity index) was reported in 83%, 90%, 85%, and 91% of patients at months 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

CD008686,0,14596519,0,A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in skeletal metastases.,"A systematic review of radiation therapy trials in several tumour types was performed by The Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU). The procedures for evaluation of the scientific literature are described separately (Acta Oncol 2003; 42: 357-365). This synthesis of the literature on radiation therapy for skeletal metastases is based on data from 16 randomized trials. Moreover, data from 20 prospective studies, 5 retrospective studies and 22 other articles were used. A total of 63 scientific articles are included, involving 8051 patients. The results were compared with those of a similar overview from 1996 including 13,054 patients. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: Irradiation of skeletal metastases is, with few exceptions, a palliative treatment. There is strong evidence that radiotherapy of skeletal metastases gives an overall (complete and partial pain relief) in more than 80% of patients. There is strong evidence that the duration of pain relief in at least 50% of patients lasts for > or = 6 months. There is convincing evidence that pain relief, in terms of degree and duration, does not depend on the fractionation schedules applied. Irrespective of the fractionation schedule used at irradiation, the number of later complications, such as spinal cord compression or pathological fractures, at the index fields are low. There are some data showing that the difference in cost between single and multifraction treatment is small. However, these data do not permit any firm conclusions to be drawn. Several reports indicate that early diagnosis and early therapy of spinal cord compression are the two most important predictors of a favourable clinical outcome after radiotherapy. However, no controlled studies have been undertaken. When the diagnosis of spinal cord compression is late, a favourable outcome might depend on the radio-responsiveness of the tumour. The documentation is weak and no conclusions can be drawn. There is some evidence that a small proportion of totally paralytic patients can regain walking function after radiotherapy. There is strong evidence that the radionuclides 89Sr and 153Sm are efficient when they are used as a systemic treatment of generalized bone pain due to metastasis from carcinomas of the prostate and breast. Overall bone pain relief occurs in about 60-80% of patients with a median response duration of 2-4 months. There is strong evidence that intravenous treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with myeloma and osteolytic bone metastasis due to carcinoma of the breast significantly decreases the number of skeleton-related events and bone pain."

CD008686,0,14565519,0,Dysembryogenetic spinal tumours in adults without dysraphism.,"The authors report 15 patients with spinal intradural dysembryogenetic tumours with clinical onset in adult age in the absence of clinical and radiological signs of dysraphism. The series includes seven lipomas, four epidermoid cysts, three dermoid cysts and one teratoma. The tumour site was the thoracic region in three cases, the lumbar cord and conus in six, the cauda equina in four and the filum terminale in two. Among 14 patients operated upon, the surgical removal was complete in eight cases, subtotal in two and partial in four. Recurrence was noticed only in one subtotally resected thoracic epidermoid cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging allows a precise diagnosis of these lesions, mainly of small lipomas and dermoids of the conus and filum, where a tethered conus is responsible for clinical symptoms. Dysembryogenetic spinal rumours that become symptomatic in adult age may require surgical treatment. Reduction of the mass and release of any associated tethered neural elements are the goal of surgery for spinal lipomas, whereas epidermoid and dermoid cysts require a more radical treatment. However, even partial resections to avoid neural damage result in a good clinical outcome and very low risk of recurrence."

The effect of unintended debris resulting from wear and corrosion (e.g., micromotion between the interconnection mechanisms in spinal implants) remains a clinical concern. The current study highlights what is known of particle-induced osteolysis and how the presence of spinal implant particulate debris deleteriously influences osseointegration of posterolateral bone graft or disrupts an established posterolateral fusion mass. Tissue explant, animal, and cell culture studies have revealed the complexity of cellular reactivity involved in aseptic particle-induced osteolysis."

We report on our experience with an intraventricular therapy consisting of mafosfamide, a preactivated cyclophosphamide derivative, and etoposide. Between May 1994 and 2002, 26 patients aged 2-19 years with various intensely pretreated disseminated brain tumors received intraventricular mafosfamide via an indwelling subcutaneous reservoir. Twenty-three of them received a dose of 20 mg. Mafosfamide was administered once or twice weekly until remission was achieved and every 2-6 weeks thereafter as maintenance therapy for a total of 736 administrations (2-63/patient). Since March 1998, two patients were switched to receive intraventricular etoposide and nine received etoposide alternating with mafosfamide. Etoposide was given at a dose of 0.5 mg x 5 d every 3-6 weeks for a total of 122 courses (1-29/patient). Immediate toxicities such as transient headaches, nausea, and vomiting occurred with mafosfamide but were manageable with premedication. Etoposide did not cause any discomfort. No long-term toxicities attributable to intrathecal therapy as evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging or neurologic evaluation were observed. Since all patients received some sort of concurrent anti-cancer therapy, the efficacy of intrathecal therapy cannot be assessed independently. However, seven of 13 patients evaluable for response by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology developed CSF dissemination under systemic chemotherapy and cleared their CSF only after administration of intrathecal mafosfamide. In conclusion, intraventricularly administered mafosfamide at a dose of 20 mg and etoposide at a dose of 0.5 mg x 5 d for patients over 2 years of age are feasible and safe and may produce responses."

CD008686,0,14529539,0,Calcitonin for osteoporosis and bone pain.,"Calcitonin has been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and other diseases involving accelerated bone turnover for approximately 25 years. The most commonly studied and prescribed form is salmon calcitonin, which has a greater efficacy in clinical use. A wealth of well-controlled clinical studies have demonstrated that calcitonin preserves or increases bone mineral density (BMD) and reduces the risk of vertebral fractures in osteoporosis. Recent studies have indicated that while a low BMD is correlated with an increase in fracture risk, increases in BMD alone do not explain the antifracture efficacy of antiresorptive therapies such as calcitonin. Therapies that moderately increase BMD may reduce fracture risk by reducing the rate of bone turnover and maintaining the integrity of the trabecular architecture, resulting in the preservation of bone strength and quality in osteoporotic patients. An advantage of calcitonin that is not shared by other antiresorptive therapies is its direct analgesic effect on bone pain. Calcitonin has been demonstrated to be clinically useful in improving pain, not only from the acute vertebral fractures of osteoporosis, but also in Paget's disease, bone malignancies, and other sources of musculoskeletal pain. Drugs containing calcitonin may be approved for additional indications in the near future, and as more convenient routes of administration such as the oral route become available, the demand for the calcitonin peptide is expected to increase."

In recent years, alcohol and phenol have been the substances most commonly used for this purpose. There are no controlled studies, so the literature consists of observations, reports and book chapters reflecting the opinions of experienced clinicians. This chapter describes the indications, contraindications, potential complications, and expected benefits of intrathecal injection of alcohol and phenol in the treatment of cancer pain. Four cases of cancer patients whose intractable pain was treated by the authors using intrathecal neurolysis are presented. Pertinent literature is reviewed.

CD008686,0,14524489,0,Palliation of metastatic bone pain: single fraction versus multifraction radiotherapy--a systematic review of randomised trials.,"Recent randomised studies have reported that single fraction radiotherapy is as effective as multifraction radiotherapy in relieving pain caused by bone metastasis. However, there are concerns about the higher re-treatment rates and the efficacy of preventing future complications, such as pathological fracture and spinal cord compression, by single fraction radiotherapy. A systematic review of randomised studies, examining the effectiveness of single fraction radiotherapy versus multiple fraction radiotherapy for metastatic bone pain relief and prevention of bone complications, was conducted to help answer this controversy. Randomised studies comparing single fraction radiotherapy with multifraction radiotherapy on metastatic bone pain were identified. The analyses were performed using intention-to-treat principle. The results were pooled using meta-analysis to estimate the effect of treatment on pain response, re-treatment rate, pathological fracture rate and spinal cord compression rate. Twelve trials involving 3621 sites were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pain-response rates for single fraction radiotherapy and multifraction radiotherapy were 60% (1080/1814) and 59% (1060/1807), respectively, giving an odds ratio (OR) of 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-1.19), indicating no difference between the two radiotherapy schedules. There was also no difference in complete pain response rates for single fraction radiotherapy (34% [508/1476]) and multifraction radiotherapy (32% [475/1473]), with an OR of 1.10 (950% CI 0.94-1.30). Patients treated by single fraction radiotherapy had a higher re-treatment rate, with 21.5% (267/1240) requiring re-treatment compared with 7.4% (91/1236) of patients in the multifraction radiotherapy arm (OR 3.44 [95% CI 2.67-4.43]). The pathological fracture rate was also higher in single fraction radiotherapy arm patients. Three per cent (37/1240) of patients treated by single fraction radiotherapy developed pathological fracture compared with 1.6% (20/1236) for those treated by multifraction radiotherapy (OR 1.82 [95% CI 1.06-3.11]). The spinal cord compression rates were similar for both arms (OR 1.41 [95% CI 0.72-2.75]). Single fraction radiotherapy was as effective as multifraction radiotherapy in relieving metastatic bone pain. However, the re-treatment rate and pathological fracture rate were higher after single fraction radiotherapy. Studies with quality of life and health economic end points are warranted to find out the optimal treatment option."

Laboratory findings showed alkaline phosphatase to be greatly elevated, and platelet counts and coagulation factor showed that the patient had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Compression fractures of the thoracic vertebrae were found on radiological examination. The histological findings from bone marrow showed metastasis of adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cells, although the primary site was unknown. To reduce tumor cells in number and improve DIC, 11 cycles of 5-Fluorouracil and leucovorin therapy were done, and the patient survived for 12 months. Autopsy showed a 0.8 cm diameter, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with the signet-ring cell type in the lamina propria of the Vater's ampulla. Many metastatic foci and micro tumor emboli were found in the lung and in bone marrow. The sections of the stomach, the gallbladder, urinary bladder, prostate, and thyroid gland showed no malignant cells. These findings suggest that the origin of the cancer may have been located in the Vater's ampulla.

CD008686,0,14505120,0,Spinal metastasis in the elderly.,"Bony metastases are a frequent problem in elderly patients affected by cancer, and those with bony metastases involve the spine in approx. 50%. The most frequent spinal metastases (60%) are from breast, lung, or prostate cancer. The chance that an elderly patient (60-79 years old) is affected by bony metastases is four times higher in men and three times higher in women than a middle-aged patient (40-59 years old). Since the medical treatment with all the adjuvant treatment options prolong the survival of this particular patient group, the spinal metastases may become a mechanical issue, thus requesting surgical treatment. Different classification systems have been proposed to rationalize surgical indications, some concentrating solely on the local spinal tumor involvement and some including the overall clinical situation. Since most of the surgical options are of palliative character, it is more important to base the decision on an overall clinical classification including the different treatment modalities-irradiation, chemotherapy, steroids, bisphosphonates, and surgery-to make a shared decision. In case surgery is indicated-neural compression, pathological fracture, instability, and progressive deformity, nursing reasons-the most straightforward procedures should be chosen, which may not need an intensive care unit stay. In the thoracolumbar spine a posterior decompression and posterolateral vertebral body resection through a posterior approach only, with a concomitant reconstruction and stabilization, has shown to work sufficiently well. In the middle and lower cervical spine the anterior approach with anterior decompression and anterior column reconstruction is most effective and has a low morbidity, whereas the occipitocervical junction can generally be treated by posterior resection and stabilization. The outcome should be determined by the survival time in an ambulatory, independent status, where pain is controlled, and the patient is not hospitalized. Surgical management shows the greatest improvement in pain reduction, but also in other domains of quality of life. Since prospective randomized studies comparing different treatment modalities for spinal metastases including surgery are not available and are ethically difficult to achieve, each case remains an interdisciplinary, shared decision making process for what is considered best for a patient or elderly patient. However, whenever surgery is an option, it should be planned before irradiation since surgery after irradiation has a significant higher complication rate."
CD008686,0,14505119,0,Principles of management of osteometabolic disorders affecting the aging spine.,"Osteoporosis is the most common contributing factor of spinal fractures, which characteristically are not generally known to produce spinal cord compression symptoms. Recently, an increasing number of medical reports have implicated osteoporotic fractures as a cause of serious neurological deficit and painful disabling spinal deformities. This has been corroborated by the present authors as well. These complications are only amenable to surgical management, requiring instrumentation. Instrumenting an osteoporotic spine, although a challenging task, can be accomplished if certain guidelines for surgical techniques are respected. Neurological deficits respond equally well to an anterior or posterior decompression, provided this is coupled with multisegmental fixation of the construct. With the steady increase in the elderly population, it is anticipated that the spine surgeon will face serious complications of osteoporotic spines more frequently. With regard to surgery, however, excellent correction of deformities can be achieved, by combining anterior and posterior approaches. Paget's disease of bone (PD) is a non-hormonal osteometabolic disorder and the spine is the second most commonly affected site. About one-third of patients with spinal involvement exhibit symptoms of clinical stenosis. In only 12-24% of patients with PD of the spine is back pain attributed solely to PD, while in the majority of patients, back pain is either arthritic in nature or a combination of a pagetic process and coexisting arthritis. In this context, one must be certain before attributing low back pain to PD exclusively, and antipagetic medical treatment alone may be ineffective. Neural element dysfunction may be attributed to compressive myelopathy by pagetic bone overgrowth, pagetic intraspinal soft tissue overgrowth, ossification of epidural fat, platybasia, spontaneous bleeding, sarcomatous degeneration and vertebral fracture or subluxation. Neural dysfunction can also result from spinal ischemia when blood is diverted by the so-called ""arterial steal syndrome"". Because the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment for pagetic spinal stenosis has been clearly demonstrated, surgical decompression should only be instituted after failure of antipagetic medical treatment. Surgery is indicated as a primary treatment when neural compression is secondary to pathologic fractures, dislocations, spontaneous epidural hematoma, syringomyelia, platybasia, or sarcomatous transformation. Five classes of drugs are available for the treatment of PD. Bisphosphonates are the most popular antipagetic drug and several forms have been investigated."

CD008686,0,12969043,0,Sacrococcygeal local anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia for pilonidal sinus surgery: a prospective randomised trial.,Sixty patients scheduled for pilonidal sinus surgery were prospectively randomly assigned to receive general anaesthesia or sacrococcygeal local anaesthesia with a newly-described technique. Patients in the general anaesthesia group spent more time in the operating theatre and recovery room than did those in the local anaesthesia group (p < 0.05). Two thirds (67%) of the patients in the local anaesthesia group left hospital on the day of surgery compared to only 17% of patients in the general anaesthesia group (p < 0.05). Visual analogue scale pain scores performed during the 3-day follow-up period favoured the local anaesthetic technique (p < 0.05). Postoperative analgesia requirements were greater in the general anaesthesia group than in the local anaesthesia group (p < 0.05). The majority of patients and surgeons expressed satisfaction with local anaesthesia. Sacrococcygeal local anaesthesia appears to be a successful alternative to general anaesthesia for pilonidal sinus surgery.
CD008686,0,12955928,0,Neuropathic pain in patients with cancer.,"We provide a detailed description of painful neural lesions in hospitalized patients with cancer. A total of 187 consecutive patients with cancer and pain, referred to the pain service of a cancer hospital, were evaluated within 24 hours by two neurologists and followed until discharge or death. Based on history, pain descriptors, physical examination, and radiological and electrophysiological studies, the pain was categorized as neuropathic in 103 patients. The most frequent sites of neurological injury were nerve roots, spinal cord and cauda equina, brachial and lumbosacral plexus, and peripheral nerves. There were no patients with pain caused by injury to the brain. In 93 of these patients, the pain was caused by ongoing neural injury, while, in 10 patients, the neural injury was old and stable. Within these two groups of patients with neuropathic pain, analgesic treatments differed. Prospective studies may determine if categorizing painful neurological injuries in cancer patients based on inferred pathophysiology is useful when deciding among different treatment options."
CD008686,0,12955271,0,[Unusual complication after combined spinal/epidural anaesthesia].,An 31-year-old women with a long history of back pain without neurological symptoms underwent a caesarean section during the 36th week of pregnancy with combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia. Indication was the increasingly severe back pain. She delivered a normal healthy boy. On the 3rd day after surgery she developed a discrete sensory cauda equina syndrome on the left side. The interpretation of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was a tumor in the thecal sac extending from the middle of the vertebral body of L-1 to the the superior vertebral plate of L-3. A few days later she underwent a laminectomy under general anaesthesia with resection of an intradural mass adherent to the cauda equina. Pathological review of the surgical specimen revealed a myxopapillary ependymoma WHO grade I. The postoperative course was uncomplicated with preservation of bladder dysfunction but after 4 weeks the bladder function was normalised.
CD008686,0,12952500,0,"Cannabis-based medicines--GW pharmaceuticals: high CBD, high THC, medicinal cannabis--GW pharmaceuticals, THC:CBD.","GW Pharmaceuticals is undertaking a major research programme in the UK to develop and market distinct cannabis-based prescription medicines [THC:CBD, High THC, High CBD] in a range of medical conditions. The cannabis for this programme is grown in a secret location in the UK. It is expected that the product will be marketed in the US in late 2003. GW's cannabis-based products include selected phytocannabinoids from cannabis plants, including D9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The company is investigating their use in three delivery systems, including sublingual spray, sublingual tablet and inhaled (but not smoked) dosage forms. The technology is protected by patent applications. Four different formulations are currently being investigated, including High THC, THC:CBD (narrow ratio), THC:CBD (broad ratio) and High CBD. GW is also developing a specialist security technology that will be incorporated in all its drug delivery systems. This technology allows for the recording and remote monitoring of patient usage to prevent any potential abuse of its cannabis-based medicines. GW plans to enter into agreements with other companies following phase III development, to secure the best commercialisation terms for its cannabis-based medicines. In June 2003, GW announced that exclusive commercialisation rights for the drug in the UK had been licensed to Bayer AG. The drug will be marketed under the Sativex brand name. This agreement also provides Bayer with an option to expand their license to include the European Union and certain world markets. GW was granted a clinical trial exemption certificate by the Medicines Control Agency to conduct clinical studies with cannabis-based medicines in the UK. The exemption includes investigations in the relief of pain of neurological origin and defects of neurological function in the following indications: multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury, peripheral nerve injury, central nervous system damage, neuroinvasive cancer, dystonias, cerebral vascular accident and spina bifida, as well as for the relief of pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis and also pain relief in brachial plexus injury. The UK Government stated that it would be willing to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 to permit the introduction of a cannabis-based medicine. GW stated in its 2002 Annual Report that it was currently conducting five phase III trials of its cannabis derivatives, including a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a sublingual spray containing High THC in more than 100 patients with cancer pain in the UK. Also included is a phase III trial of THC:CBD (narrow ratio) being conducted in patients with severe pain due to brachial plexus injury, as are two more phase III trials of THC:CBD (narrow ratio) targeting spasticity and bladder dysfunction in multiple sclerosis patients. Another phase III trial of THC:CBD (narrow ratio) in patients with spinal cord injury is also being conducted. Results from the trials are expected during 2003. Three additional trials are also in the early stages of planning. These trials include a phase I trial of THC:CBD (broad ratio) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, a phase I trial of High CBD in patients with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and a preclinical trial of High CBD in various CNS disorders (including epilepsy, stroke and head injury). GW Pharmaceuticals submitted an application for approval of cannabis-based medicines to UK regulatory authorities in March 2003. Originally GW hoped to market cannabis-based prescription medicines by 2004, but is now planning for a launch in the UK towards the end of 2003. Several trials for GW's cannabis derivatives have also been completed, including four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials conducted in the UK. The trials were initiated by GW in April 2002, to investigate the use of a sublingual spray containing THC:CBD (narrow ratio) in the following medical conditions: pain in spinal cord injury, pain and sleep in MS and spinal cord injury, neuropathic pain in MS and general neuropathic pain (presented as allodynia). Results from these trials show that THC:CBD (narrow ratio) caused statistically significant reductions in neuropathic pain in patients with MS and other conditions. In addition, improvements in other MS symptoms were observed as well. Phase II studies of THC:CBD (narrow ratio) have also been completed in patients with MS, spinal cord injury, neuropathic pain and a small number of patients with peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes mellitus or AIDS. A phase II trial of THC:CBD (broad ratio) has also been completed in a small number of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as has a trial of High CBD in patients with neurogenic symptoms. A phase II trial has also been evaluated with High THC in small numbers of patients for the treatment of perioperative pain. The phase II trials provided positive results and confirmed an excellent safety profile for cannabis-based medicines. GW Pharmaceuticals received an IND approval to commence phase II clinical trials in Canada in patients with chronic pain, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury in 2002. Following meetings with the US FDA, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the Office for National Drug Control Policy, and National Institute for Drug Abuse, GW was granted an import license from the DEA and has imported its first cannabis extracts into the US. Preclinical research with these extracts in the US is ongoing."

CD008686,0,12946033,0,March 2003: a 41 -year-old female with a solitary lesion in the liver.,"The March COM. A 41-year-old woman presented in 1997 with diffuse abdominal pain, meteorism and intermittent diarrhea. Imaging studies revealed a focal rounded lesion in the liver. Although there was no history of progesterone or estrogen therapy, the radiographic appearance was considered to be suggestive of adenoma. The lesion was monitored by ultrasound until October 2000 when a resection was performed because of the presumed risk of a malignant transformation. H&E stained sections revealed an ectopic ependymoma that was strongly positive for GFAP. The surrounding hepatic tissue was negative for GFAP. An extensive search for a CNS manifestation or any other extraspinal localization was unrevealing. We believe we have encountered the first case of an ectopic ependymoma presenting as a solitary hepatic lesion in the absence of CNS disease. Ependymomas generally arise in the CNS in relation to the ventricular system. Extraneural metastasis from ependymomas may occasionally occur even years after detection and treatment of the primary lesion and have been the subject of several reports. In contrast, there are only anecdotal reports of primary extraneural ""ectopic"" ependymomas. So far those rare cases have only been found in close vicinity to the neural axis, eg, in the sacrococcygeal region, the posterior mediastinum or the ovaries and are there thought to originate from embryonic remnant cells around the neural tube. Distant metastases of ependymomas invading or arising within the extraneural lumbosacral soft tissue may occur in this situation. Here, we report what appears to be the first case of a primary ectopic ependymoma originating in the liver, with no signs of CNS or other systemic involvement."

He was admitted with severe intractable lower back pain requiring high doses of intravenous narcotic analgesia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was highly suggestive of disk infection. Fluoroscopically guided needle aspiration of the disk space was confirmatory, and both tissue and blood cultures were positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. Treatment included i.v. vancomycin and oral levofloxacin. The most common organism causing disk space infection is Staphylococcus aureus. but Staphylococcus epidermis should be considered in immunocompromised patients.

CD008686,0,12920229,0,"ALK+, CD30-, CD20- large B-cell lymphoma containing anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fused to clathrin heavy chain gene (CLTC).","Pathological features and genomic basis of a rare case of ALK(+), CD30(-), CD20(-) large B-cell lymphoma were analyzed. A 36-year-old Japanese female was admitted because of lumbago and constitutional symptoms. Physical examination and laboratory tests showed anemia (hemoglobin, 7.5 g/dL), mild hepatosplenomegaly, and immunoglobin G (IgG) lambda-type monoclonal gammopathy (IgG, 2782 mg/dL). The lymphoma spread exclusively in extranodal sites such as bone marrow, liver, spleen, ovary, and muscle. Biopsy specimens obtained from the ovary showed monomorphic proliferation of large immunoblastic cells with basophilic cytoplasm, round-shaped nuclei with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, and prominent single nucleolus. Immunostaining with anti-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) antibody, ALK1, showed finely granular cytoplasmic staining pattern. These cells were also positive for epithelial membrane antigen, CD4, CD19, CD38, CD138, cytoplasmic IgG, and lambda chain, but negative for CD30 (Ber-H2), CD56, CD57, and other T- and B-cell markers. Southern blot analyses revealed that Ig heavy and lambda light chain genes, but not T-cell receptor (TCR) beta gene, were clonally rearranged. Chromosomal analyses by conventional G-banding, spectral karyotyping, and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed complex abnormality involving 2p23, and chromosome 2 was translocated to chromosome 17. As 2;17 translocation resulting in the fusion of clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) gene with ALK was previously reported in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, we performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and demonstrated that the lymphoma cells contained CLTC-ALK fusion transcript. Under the diagnosis of ALK(+), CD30(-), CD20(-) large B-cell lymphoma, she was treated with conventional combination chemotherapies. However, the lymphoma was primarily chemotherapy resistant, and the patient died 11 months after admission. We consider that this case confirms the existence of ALK(+), CD30(-), CD20(-) large B-cell lymphomas proposed by Delsol et al. (16) and further provides relevant information regarding their clinicopathological features and cytogenetics."

On average, higher CSF leukocyte (lymphocyte and monocyte) counts, IgG index, CSF IgG contents, but not of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 in CSF and serum, were revealed in all MS or patients with long disease course (LO-MS) compared with controls. In primary progressive MS (PP-MS) cell counts were low, but IgG contents were high, when compared to relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS). In clinically probable MS (CP-MS) both contents were low, in clinically definite MS (CD-MS) high. Spearman's correlation with the four monokines and the basic indices in CSF revealed activation patterns known for microglia/macrophages in the four MS subgroups, for astrocytes in CP-MS and RR-MS, for CSF lymphocytes in CP-MS and PP-MS, for cells of blood-brain barrier (BBB) in CP-MS, for intrathecal IgG synthesis in PP-MS and for lymphocyte transfer in CD-MS. Correlations between CSF and serum parameters indicated CNS disease processes to be associated with systemic processes of inflammation (acute, chronic) in CD-MS, RR-MS, and PP-MS in different ways.

Clinical features and results of investigations were collected at admission and during the course of the disease. Motor, sphincter, and global outcomes were compared with those in the main adult and pediatric series. During the initial phase, the most common presenting symptoms were pain (88%) and fever (58%). Motor loss preceded sphincter dysfunction in two thirds of patients and became bilateral in half of the patients. When maximal deficit was achieved (plateau), the patients presented a combination of sensory, motor, and sphincter dysfunctions without radicular involvement The motor loss consistently involved the lower limbs but was inconsistent and moderate in the upper limbs. The mean duration of the plateau was 1 week. The recovery phase was characterized by a progressive improvement of all deficits. Sphincter dysfunction improved more slowly than did the other deficits. A full recovery was achieved by 31% of the patients; minimal sequelae were present in 25% and mild to severe sequelae in 44%. An unfavorable outcome was associated with complete paraplegia (P = .03) and/or a time to maximal deficit shorter than 24 hours (P = .005).

In this report we describe the clinical, radiologic, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical findings in 15 cases retrieved from our files. The study group comprised 7 males and 8 females, ranging in age from 17 to 44 years (mean age, 32 years). The tumors involved the cervical (n = 11), thoracic (n = 1), lumbar (n = 2), and sacrococcygeal (n = 1) regions and ranged in size from 1.0 to 6.0 cm in greatest dimension (median size, 3 cm). Symptoms were present for 2 months to at least 2 years, with the most common complaint being pain localized to the spinal region (n = 12). Ten patients also had radicular symptoms. Radiologic studies, available for 11 cases, usually demonstrated a mass involving the posterior aspect of adjoining vertebrae. Bony abnormalities (including scalloping, erosion, and destruction), facet joint and soft tissue involvement, and extradural extension were typically present. Histologically, all tumors contained a proliferation of epithelioid (histiocytoid) cells, admixed with varying numbers of osteoclast-like giant cells, siderophages, xanthoma cells, lymphocytes, and some spindled fibroblast-like cells. Only 1 tumor had the classic villiform architecture of pigmented villonodular synovitis. The remaining 14 tumors had a nodular appearance with varying amounts of collagen. Seven of these had definite histological evidence of infiltrative growth, and 6 had some features that warranted concern for possible infiltration. Only 1 tumor had findings fully compatible with a localized synovial-type giant cell tumor/nodular (teno)synovitis. All tumors had mitotic activity, with mitotic counts ranging from 1 to 21 mitotic figures per 50 high-power fields (HPFs) (mean mitotic count, 5 mitotic figures/50 HPFs). Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5 tumors, and immunoreactivity was present for CD68, CD163, and vimentin. Limited immunoreactivity for muscle actin (HUC1-1) was also noted. Follow-up information was available for 9 of the 15 patients (60%). Five patients had no evidence of recurrent or persistent disease 4 months to 9 years after undergoing either a local excision with gross total tumor removal (with or without irradiation) or a wide en bloc resection. Four patients had persistent disease after undergoing either an incomplete resection or biopsy with spinal fusion procedure. All 4 of these patients had additional surgical intervention (accompanied by irradiation in 2 instances), but only one was known to be disease-free at last follow-up (10 years after gross total tumor removal). No patient has experienced a metastasis or died of disease. The best predictor of outcome was gross total tumor removal at the surgical outset."

As a general rule, the radiographic pattern was lytic type; other aspects were osteosclerotic, mixed, lytic vs mixed and osteosclerotic vs lytic patterns. The main symptom is pain, although many bone metastases are asymptomatic. The most severe consequences are pathologic fractures and cord compression. Clinical evaluation of patients with skeletal metastases needs multimodal diagnostic imaging, able to detect lesions, to assess their extension and localization, and eventually drive the biopsy (for histo-morphological diagnosis). These techniques give different performances in terms of sensitivity and specificity; but none of the modalities alone seems to be adequate to yield a reliable diagnostic outcome. Therefore multidisciplinary cooperation is required to optimize the screening, clinical management and follow-up of the patients. In other terms, what is the efficacy of these new diagnostic tests compared to the ""older"" diagnostic tests? Frequently the new procedures do not replace the older one, but it is added to the diagnostic workup, thereby increasing costs without impacting the ""patient's condition"". The aim of the present work is to propose an ""algorithm"" for the detection and diagnosis of skeletal metastases, which may be applied differently in symptomatic and asymptomatic oncologic patients. Bone scintigraphy remains the first choice technique in the evaluation of asymptomatic patients, in whom skeletal metastases are supposed. Although it has a high sensitivity, scintigraphy is unspecific. So that a negative scan response has to be re-evaluated with other methods: if clinical status remains ""negative"", the diagnostic route can stop. On the contrary, in patients with ""positive"" scan or with local symptoms and pain, the screening of metastatic lesions must be accomplished by a combination of radiography and CT: the result may be negative (for low sensitivity of conventional radiology), not conclusive (in this case bone biopsy is necessary) or symptoms are not due to metastatic lesions (i.e., osteoarthritis). CT represents an excellent mean of defining the extent of any metastatic lesions, especially those located at sites difficult to evaluate (vertebral column and pelvis). Before bone biopsy is carried out, MRI must be performed, because it is the only technique that makes it possible to distinguish between bone marrow components. It has been used most extensively in the evaluation of spine metastases. The limitation of MRI is the unspecificity of its findings, which may lead to an equivocal diagnosis, and because only part of the skeleton can be studied."

CD008686,0,12851776,0,[Bladder rupture caused by spontaneous perforation of an infected urachal cyst].,"Anomalies of the fetal urachus are rare. Normally, the postnatal urachus presents as a fibrous band extending from the bladder to the umbilicus. Urachal cysts may occur in postnatal life. Spontaneous perforation of urachal cysts is a very rare condition, which clinically may not be distinguishable from other acute abdominal conditions. We report a case of a 63-year-old male with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and a bladder rupture caused by a spontaneous perforation of an infected urachal cyst. The symptomatology showed abdominal rigidity and pain, a palpable mass in the lower abdomen, and hematuria. Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis and an increased CRP level. The bladder rupture was confirmed by cystography. Bacteriologic examination identified Proteus vulgaris, Corynebacterium species, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most of the published cases in the literature report about intraperitoneal perforation of infected urachal cysts. In the present case, we found a spontaneous perforation of an infected urachal cyst leading to an extraperitoneal bladder rupture with an extraperitoneal limitation of the infection. The definitive therapy was complete surgical excision including a cuff of the bladder, drainage, and systemic broad-spectrum and local application of antibiotics. The further course was uneventful."
CD008686,0,12850649,0,Long-term outcomes during treatment of chronic pain with intrathecal clonidine or clonidine/opioid combinations.,"To evaluate the effectiveness of intrathecal clonidine or clonidine/opioid admixture for the treatment of chronic pain states, a retrospective chart audit of 15 patients seen by the Pain Medicine and Neurosurgical Services was performed. Subjects included 9 men and 6 women aged 26-86 years. Diagnoses included complex regional pain syndrome, neuropathic pain, and cancer pain. All patients received a trial of single-shot and/or short-term infusion of clonidine. Those reporting a significant reduction in pain, or at least 50% reduction in their visual analog scale (VAS), received long-term therapy. Intrathecal clonidine as a single-shot dose, infusion, or as intrathecal polytherapy did not improve VAS scales from pre-treatment values in 5 patients. Ten patients reported significant pain relief or >50% decrease in VAS scores with the initial trial and received long-term therapy. Two received clonidine alone for 7-11 months before the therapy failed; others failed after just a few days. Seven of eight initially responded to clonidine alone (75-950 microg/day) before failing and requiring a second drug. Three received hydromorphone (200-8000 microg/day) and four morphine (0.15-15 mg/day) with clonidine. Four patients then failed 2-drug therapy (duration 6-21 months). Two continue with intrathecal clonidine/hydromorphone (duration 19-29 months) and 1 with clonidine/morphine (duration 21 months). After initiation of intrathecal clonidine, one patient reported good relief with clonidine/morphine until his death 5 months later. In this population, intrathecal clonidine was of limited utility for most patients. It may be of benefit for subset(s) of patients, but in our experience, duration of relief is typically <18 months."

A report of two operated patients and a review of the literature.,"We report on 2 patients in whom a cystic dilation of the conus medullaris was incidentally found at MR imaging carried out in the work-up for sciatica. The cysts were well circumscribed and had signal intensity identical to the CSF on both T1- and T2-weighted images. There was no evidence of contrast enhancement. None of the patients had specific symptoms related to the spinal cord. At surgery, no evidence of malignancy was seen in any of the patients. A benign cystic dilation, also called dilated ventriculus terminalis, occasionally can be seen in the conus medullaris as an incidental finding at thoracolumbar MR imaging. Unless the expansion per se indicates cyst drainage, these patients may be monitored by clinical and MR follow-up, avoiding surgery in a substantial number of cases."
CD008686,0,12846127,0,The multidisciplinary approach to bone metastases.,"With recent advances in the management of cancer, the clinical course of patients with metastatic bone disease is more likely to be prolonged and accompanied by morbidity, including severe pain, hypercalcemia, pathologic fracture, and spinal cord and/or nerve root compression. The early identification of patients at higher risk for developing bone metastases enables practitioners to be proactive in their diagnosis and treatment. A multidisciplinary approach that integrates the diagnosis and treatment of the cancer, symptom management, and rehabilitation ensures optimal care. Bisphosphonates can reduce the number of skeletal-related complications, delay the onset of progressive disease in bone, and relieve metastatic bone pain caused by a variety of solid tumors with a resulting enhanced quality of life. The complexity of the clinical problem and the need to involve an array of health-care providers present a logistical and clinical challenge. A strong argument is made for a thematically integrated bone metastases program as part of the primary care of patients with cancer."

Clinically, the patient showed mild tetraparesis, signs of spinal ataxia and symmetrical hyperreflexia. Following subtotal removal of the cyst via left-sided suboccipital craniotomy and left-sided hemilaminectomy of C1 the lesion was classified as synovial cyst on histopathological examination. Postoperatively, the quadriparesis almost completely subsided and the patient is currently doing well, 33 months after surgery. Synovial or ganglion cysts adjacent to the atlantoaxial articulation with ventral compression of the cervicomedullar cord represent rare surgical or radiological entities. Atlantoaxial synovial cysts have no typical radiographic appearance or specific neurological symptoms so that they are frequently misdiagnosed as intraspinal- or skull base tumour, rheumatoid lesion or ectatic vertebral artery. Since no ensuing complications or recurrences have been encountered in cases of incompletely removed cysts the less invasive operative approaches should be used to avoid destabilisation and subsequent additional surgical procedures."

For this reason, it is important for those caring for younger athletes to maintain a high index of suspicion for some of the more common pathologic causes of back pain in this population. Diagnostic evaluation should be undertaken more quickly in pediatric and adolescent athletes. Sports-related diagnoses that must be considered include disc-related back pain, atypical Scheuermann's kyphosis, spondylolysis, and spondylolisthesis. Patients of this age may also present with conditions not associated with activity, including discitis, classic Scheuermann's disease, rheumatologic disease, and spinal tumors. History and physical exam provide valuable information to help guide further diagnostic studies which, in turn, will determine necessary treatment. No definitive studies are available regarding the diagnosis and treatment of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. Health professionals need to consider the expertise of a local radiologist when deciding upon diagnostic imaging procedures.

CD008686,0,19761075,0,Assessment of pain caused by invasive procedures in cancer patients.,"Invasive procedures are commonly required in the diagnosis and management of cancer in adults. However, little is known regarding the prevalence and severity of procedure-related pain in this patient population. This prospective study was conducted to determine the frequency and types of invasive procedures performed in a large comprehensive cancer center, the intensity of pain associated with these procedures, the types of periprocedural analgesics administered, and how these patients would like their procedural pain to be managed in the future. During a 6-week period, 102 cancer patients were interviewed immediately after undergoing an invasive procedure. They were asked to rate the pain they experienced before, during, and after their procedure using a verbal descriptor scale (VDS) ranging from 0 to 10. They also were asked if they would want more, less, or the same amount of pain medication if they were to undergo the same procedure again. The most frequently performed procedures were bone marrow aspirates and biopsies (68%), lumbar punctures (14%), and placements of central venous catheters (10%). The average pain rating during these procedures was 4.2 (standard deviation [SD], 3.0). However, 26% of patients experienced severe pain (VDS score > or = 7) during the procedures. Twenty-four percent of patients surveyed received conscious sedation for their procedure. There was no statistical relationship between patients' pain ratings and their satisfaction with the pain control they received during the procedures. This study represents the largest descriptive study of procedural pain in adult cancer patients. As more than 50% of these patients experienced moderate to severe pain during procedures, further studies are needed to improve the control of procedure-related pain in patients with cancer."

CD008686,0,12821407,0,The Lindblom roller.,"Neuropathic pain is caused by injury of the peripheral or central nervous system. The neurological examination of the sensory system in neuropathic pain patients guides the anatomical localization of the injury. Among the sensory modalities to be tested, priority should be given to those subserved by small peripheral sensory fibers or by the spinothalamic tract that most commonly are abnormal in neuropathic pain patients. Testing of cold and warm perception was traditionally carried out in the clinic using tubes filled with water at different temperatures, a cumbersome method that has limited the routine examination of these sensory modalities. The Lindblom roller offers a practical and effective method of readily testing temperature perception and is among the best available clinical tools for delineating the anatomical boundaries of a sensory abnormality. Routinely use of the Lindblom roller shall be standard bedside clinical assessment of neuropathic pain patients. To exemplify this statement we describe two patients affected by complex and fluctuating painful sensory abnormalities caused by an extradural mass compressing the spinal cord. The level of the injury was readily localized with a roller kept at room temperature."

Five patients with histologically proven metastases to the pelvis, ilium, or femur were treated by percutaneous injection of liquid bone cement as an attempt to control severe bone pain. After percutaneous osteoplasty, all five patients experienced immediate and substantial pain relief and did not require pain medication for the duration of follow-up. No clinically significant complications occurred. Whereas percutaneous osteoplasty of the spine (vertebroplasty) is well-described and widely accepted to treat pain caused by benign or malignant vertebral body diseases, osteoplasty of bones outside the spine is less known.

CD008686,0,12801599,0,Induction of pain facilitation by sustained opioid exposure: relationship to opioid antinociceptive tolerance.,"Opioid analgesics are frequently used for the long-term management of chronic pain states, including cancer pain. The prolonged use of opioids is associated with a requirement for increasing doses to manage pain at a consistent level, reflecting the phenomenon of analgesic tolerance. It is now becoming clearer that patients receiving long-term opioid therapy can develop unexpected abnormal pain. Such paradoxical opioid-induced pain, as well as tolerance to the antinociceptive actions of opioids, has been reliably measured in animals during the period of continuous opioid delivery. Several recent studies have demonstrated that such pain may be secondary to neuroplastic changes that result, in part, from an activation of descending pain facilitation mechanisms arising from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). One mechanism which may mediate such pain facilitation is through the increased activity of CCK in the RVM. Secondary consequences from descending facilitation may be produced. For example, opioid-induced upregulation of spinal dynorphin levels seem to depend on intact descending pathways from the RVM reflecting spinal neuroplasticity secondary to changes at supraspinal levels. Increased expression of spinal dynorphin reflects a trophic action of sustained opioid exposure which promotes an increased pain state. Spinal dynorphin may promote pain, in part, by enhancing the evoked release of excitatory transmitters from primary afferents. In this regard, opioids also produce trophic actions by increasing CGRP expression in the dorsal root ganglia. Increased pain elicited by opioids is a critical factor in the behavioral manifestation of opioid tolerance as manipulations which block abnormal pain also block antinociceptive tolerance. Manipulations that have blocked enhanced pain and antinociceptive tolerance include reversible and permanent ablation of descending facilitation from the RVM. Thus, opioids elicit systems-level adaptations resulting in pain due to descending facilitation, upregulation of spinal dynorphin and enhanced release of excitatory transmitters from primary afferents. Adaptive changes produced by sustained opioid exposure including trophic effects to enhance pain transmitters suggest the need for careful evaluation of the consequences of long-term opioid administration to patients."
CD008686,0,12799982,0,[Analgesic and analgesia-potentiating action of B vitamins].,"Disregarding pain resulting from vitamin deficiency, an analgesic effect seems to be exerted only by vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B6 (pyridoxines), and vitamin B12 (cobalamine), particularly when the three are given in combination. The analgesic effect is attributed to an increased availability and/or effectiveness of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine acting as inhibitory transmitters in the nociceptive system. In animal experiments, high doses of these vitamins administered alone or in combination inhibited nociceptive behavior and depressed the nociceptive activity evoked in single neurons of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the thalamus. Moreover, they were found to enhance the antinociceptive effect of non-opioid analgesic agents on withdrawal reflexes. Clinical data fail in most cases to meet current standards of evaluation (randomization, double-blindness). Still, it appears that high doses of the vitamins B1, B6, and B12 administered separately or in combination can alleviate acute pain and potentiate the analgesia caused by non-opioid analgesics such as the NSAIDs and metamizol (dipyrone). Therapeutic effects are observed in neuropathic pain and pain of musculoskeletal origin. Vitamin B6 is effective in the carpal tunnel syndrome which, however, is attributed at least in some cases to vitamin B6 deficiency. It is also worth noting that the B vitamins are shown to enhance the beneficial effect of diclofenac in acute low-back pain so that either the duration of treatment or the daily dose of diclofenac may be reduced. The use of high doses of vitamin B6 may be limited by a neurotoxic effect. The effectiveness of B vitamins in depressing chronic pain has not been established. It would be interesting to know if the B vitamins are of use as adjuvants in the treatment of tumor pain."
CD008686,0,12791349,0,Reconstructive options in the treatment of osteoradionecrosis of the craniomaxillofacial skeleton.,"Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the craniomaxillofacial skeleton is a serious and debilitating complication that can occur following radiation therapy in the head and neck. Patients require effective treatment, which eradicates diseased tissue and restores function with minimal additional morbidity in a single stage, a requirement fulfilled in many cases by free tissue transfer. In a 6-year period from 1994 to 1999, 21 patients with ORN were treated by wide resection and free-flap reconstruction. The median interval between radiation therapy and ORN was 4 years (range: 1-33 years). The median radiation dose was 6000cGy. The affected areas were the mandible (15 patients), the temporal bone (three patients), the maxilla (one patient), the cervical vertebrae (one patient) and the frontal bone (one patient). Clinical symptoms included pain, ulceration, a persistent draining fistula, exposure of bone or hardware, and pathological fracture or non-union of bone. Six patients had had previous unsuccessful attempts at conservative surgical resection. Ten patients had preoperative hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy. A number of different flaps were used for reconstruction in these patients. These included free fibula flaps (13 patients), iliac crest flaps (two patients), scapula flaps (three patients) and rectus abdominis flaps (three patients). All patients achieved relief from their presenting symptoms and primary bone or wound healing. One flap (4.8%) was lost. This was successfully reconstructed in a subsequent procedure. There were three flap re-explorations, two for arterial thrombosis and one for venous thrombosis. Conservative measures, such as limited debridement and HBO therapy, may be effective in preventing the progression of ORN. However, they fail to eradicate established ORN, which requires radical surgical resection followed by functional reconstruction with well-vascularised tissue."

The purpose of this review is to provide an overview on the properties, clinical development, and application of ferucarbotran. Safety data obtained during clinical phases I-III revealed a total of 162 adverse events within 1053 patients, of which 75 were classified as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related. The majority of events occurred within the first 3 h (73 of 75) and was of mild intensity. The agent significantly improves the detection of hypovascular focal liver lesions with a comparable sensitivity in lesion detection to CTAP but without a relevant loss in specificity. Furthermore, ferucarbotran leads to a significant improvement of the sensitivity for lesion classification and characterization of the most frequent liver lesions. Contrast-enhanced MRA is not feasible and the angiographic effect is not sufficient to allow for postprocessing of data into maximum intensity projections. Intraindividual studies at low-field (0.2 T) and high-field (1.5 T) showed similar rates for lesion detection. The time window for contrast-enhanced MRI of the liver is at least 1 day up to 4 days. The compound can be regarded as safe and well tolerated. Even bolus injections caused no cardiovascular side effects, lumbar back pain, or clinically relevant laboratory changes. The examination time can be kept short with T1- and T2-weighted pre-contrast sequences, dynamic MRI over 10 min, and finally accumulation phase T2-weighted MRI.

CD008686,0,12762481,0,Gene therapy of chronic pain.,"Chronic pain is frequently associated with profound alterations of neuronal systems involved in pain processing and should be considered as an actual disease state of the nervous system. It should not only be relieved, but must really be treated in suffering patients. However, some forms of chronic pain, in particular those of neuropathic origin, are most often not satisfactorily managed with currently available pharmacological agents, some of which, in addition, may be poorly tolerated by some patients. In this context, gene-based approaches may contribute to the search for a better management of chronic pain. The question then arises regarding the most appropriate level for such an intervention using gene-transfer techniques. The first experimental protocols attempted the transfer of opioid precursor genes and their overexpression mainly at the spinal level. They demonstrated the feasibility and the real interest of these approaches by showing that local overproduction of opioid peptides induced antinociceptive effects in animal models of persistent pain, of inflammatory-, neuropathic- and even cancerous origin. Although really tempting data were obtained using gene-based techniques in experimental inflammatory diseases, the possible clinical interest of these approaches in chronic pain has still to be established. Nevertheless, targeting some proinflammatory cytokines, involved not only in inflammation but also in the induction and probably the perpetuation of pain, raises the possibility to block the ""development"" of chronic pain rather that to ""simply"" relieve established ongoing pain. Future gene-based protocols will certainly target some of the recently identified molecules involved in pain transduction mechanisms, sensory nerve sensitization or pain perpetuation, and evaluate their potential interest to ideally abolish or, at least, reduce chronic pain."

A lumbar mass (10%). The diagnosis was established by ultra-sonography and CT-scan in all the patients. The mean tumour diameter was 10 cm (5-17 cm), it were located in down pole in 53%. The surgical procedure consisted of radical nephrectomy and regional or hailer lymph node dissection in 46 patients. The post operative course was marked by one death due to pulmonary metastases. The mean follow-up was (2 to 15 years). Asynchronies metastases occurred in 6 patients after a mean interval (9 to 36 months). The overall 5 year survival was 100% PT1, 78% PT2, 34% PT3."
CD008686,0,12724022,0,Thyroid function and postmenopause.,"There is an increasing prevalence of high levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with age - particularly in postmenopausal women - which are higher than in men. The incidence of thyroid disease in a population of postmenopausal women is as follows: clinical thyroid disease, about 2.4%; subclinical thyroid disease, about 23.2%. Among the group with subclinical thyroid disease, 73.8% are hypothyroid and 26.2% are hyperthyroid. The rate of thyroid cancer increases with age. The symptoms of thyroid disease can be similar to postmenopausal complaints and are clinically difficult to differentiate. There can also be an absence of clinical symptoms. It is of importance that even mild thyroid failure can have a number of clinical effects such as depression, memory loss, cognitive impairment and a variety of neuromuscular complaints. Myocardial function has been found to be subtly impaired. There is also an increased cardiovascular risk, caused by increased serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein. These adverse effects can be improved or corrected by L-thyroxine replacement therapy. Such treatment has been found to be cost-effective. With time, overt hypothyroidism can develop. Therefore, routine screening of thyroid function in the climacteric period to determine subclinical thyroid disease is recommended. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in women with hypothyroidism treated with thyroxine causes changes in free thyroxine and TSH. Increased binding of thyroxine to elevated thyroxine-binding globulin causes an elevation of TSH by feedback. Since adaptation is insufficient, there is an increased need for thyroxine in these women taking HRT. TSH levels should be controlled at 12 weeks after the beginning of therapy. At higher age the need for iodine and thyroxine is decreased. Therefore, therapy has to be controlled. For bone metabolism thyroid hormones play a dominant role. While there are only marginal differences between hypothyroid patients and euthyroid controls, there are large differences for hyperthyroid patients. Previous thyrotoxicosis and subsequent long-lasting L-thyroxine treatment are together associated with reduction in femoral and vertebral bone density in postmenopausal women. In these cases HRT is important for the control of bone loss."

After operation of the tumor, the diagnosis of a generalized CPPD disease was established retrospectively, where by patient had complained of joint pain already for many years. This known complication of a primary chondrocalcinosis should be a reason for a careful investigation of the cervical spine in CPPD disease, because neurological disturbances might increase the joint destruction in the manner of ""Charcot joints""."
CD008686,0,12720031,0,Infantile myofibromatosis of the central nervous system.,"Infantile myofibromatosis is the most common fibrous disorder of infancy and childhood. It may occur in two distinct forms: multicentric and solitary. In both cases involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is unusual: brain myofibromas are usually intracranial in proximity of the dura mater, with infiltration of the calvarial bones and secondary brain compression. Spine myofibromas are exceptional and most of the cases reported in the literature represent secondary locations of visceral lesions. The natural history of myofibromas of the CNS in infantile myofibromatosis is characterized by a period of rapid growth, subsequent stabilization, and spontaneous regression in many cases. On these grounds surgical treatment is reserved for lesions that compress the brain or spinal cord and show an obvious progression. Small lesions or tumor residuals in asymptomatic children without visceral involvement should be closely observed as first choice."

The physical examination showed a patient with a prominent kyphoskoliosis. The patient reported of having a situs inversus abdominalis and a tethered cord syndrome. Bladder function disorders were present since childhood. Upper endoscopy demonstrated a 4 cm large, exophytically growing necrotic tumour of the oesophagus. The CT scan showed a space occupying tumour of the oesophagus and metastases in a size of 1.5 cm in both lungs. Further imaging revealed a UICC-Stadium IVB (T2NxMIb ). Histology of the tumour biopsies showed a poor differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Staging after the 6 th dose cisplatin (100 mg/m2/die) and 5-fluorouracil (5 x 1000 mg/m2/die) showed a mild reduction of the tumour and the metastases. The patient died ten months later of multiorgan failure after severe progress of tumour and metastatic growth. The manifestation of squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus is unusual in people at the age of twenty. Genetic and chromosomal analysis of the patient gave no evidence for a hereditary disorder. Drug history revealed that the patient had been treated with the alpha-receptor blocking drug phenoxybenzamine over at least 12 years for bladder dysfunction. Animal experiments of rats with exposition of phenoxybenzamine over 24 months produced gastrointestinal malignomas. By the German admission board phenoxybenzamine is only recommended for short term therapy. It seems to be likely that even in humans phenoxybenzamine acts as a mutagenic substance and should be carefully used in long-term treatment."
CD008686,0,12693000,0,[A case of primary lung cancer with initial symptoms due to orbital metastases].,"We encountered a case of lung cancer in which symptoms due to orbital metastasis were recognized. A 55-year-old man presented with a chief complaint of double vision. Orbital MR image demonstrated a right intraorbital mass with bone destruction, which resulted in oculomotor nerve palsy and optic nerve disturbance. Chest CT scan showed a 4 cm mass in the right S6, which was diagnosed on biopsy as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A whole-body scintigram revealed multiple bone metastases: the right orbital wall, the lower cervical spine, the left knee joint, and so on. Based on the clinical findings, we believed that the orbital tumor was a metastasis from the lung. Systemic chemotherapy and irradiation of the right orbital tumor and the left knee joint were performed. Though a favorable response was achieved in ocular movement, the patient died 3 months after initial treatment because of progression of the primary lesion. Including this case, seventeen reported cases in which lung cancer metastasized to the orbit in Japan were also reviewed."
CD008686,0,12692673,0,Aneurysmal bone cysts of the sacrum. Clinical report and review of the literature.,"Aneurysmal bone cysts, first described by Jaffe and Lichtenstein in 1942, are benign lesions that may easily be mistaken for a malignant tumor both radiographically and pathologically. These diagnostic problems are due to their rapid growth, extensive destruction of bone, wide extraosseous tumor masses, and marked cellular exuberance. The differential diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cysts including giant cell tumor, calcified solitary bone cysts, low-grade osteosarcoma, and teleangiectatic osteosarcoma becomes even more complicated when the lesion arises at sites other than the long bones and presents with extensive extraosseous, soft-tissue tumor masses. The latter cases--especially when they occur as sacral or presacral tumors--present challenges with respect to successful treatment, which should combine surgical removal of the entire lesion following oncological criteria to prevent recurrences and osteosynthesis to guarantee the biomechanical stability of the spinal-pelvic junction. Here we report on the clinical case of a female patient with an aneurysmal bone cyst of the sacrum and extensive extraosseous tumor masses. The report includes the diagnostic challenges, the surgical options of sacral and/or presacral tumors, the histopathological findings, and long-term clinical and radiographic surveillance."
CD008686,0,12690880,0,Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.,"Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are a commonly encountered clinical problem. Although the majority of patients with this injury experience a benign and self-limited course of gradually resolving pain, a significant number continue to experience chronic pain and disability. In evaluating a patient with a vertebral compression fracture, the differential diagnosis must consider not only osteoporosis, but also various causes of osteomalacia, endocrinopathy, and malignancy. Accumulation of multiple compression fractures and increased thoracolumbar kyphosis are associated with a poor prognosis. Multiple medical treatments--including hormone replacement therapy, calcitonin, and bisphosphonates--are effective in maintaining or increasing bone mass and reducing the risk of compression fracture. Conventional treatment in the form of pain medication, activity limitation, and occasionally bracing is effective in returning most patients to their previous level of functioning. When therapies fail, patients may be considered for minimally invasive treatments such as vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Surgery, although enormously challenging because of poor underlying health status and structurally weak bone, may be the last resort for a small percentage of patients experiencing progressive deformity or neurologic deficit."

Patients complained of vertebral pain in all cases. Walking was impossible for 13 patients. Ten patients presented neurological deficit. Treatment included percutaneous vertebroplasty in all patients, radiotherapy in 15 patients and neural decompression surgery in 3 patients. Mean duration of hospitalization was 14.1 days (range 2-60 days) and the mean follow-up was 5.6 months (range 1-18 months). Preprocedural pain, measured by the visual analog scale (VAS), was 9.1, decreasing to 3.2 after the procedure and 2.8 at the last follow-up visit. Morphinics were discontinued in 7 of 14 patients following discharge from hospital. Ten out of 13 (77%) patients recovered walking capacity. Neurological status improved in three out of five patients. No further vertebral compression occurred in the vertebrae treated. Overall, 81% of the patients in this study were satisfied or very satisfied with the procedure. One patient (5%) had transitory radicular neuritis after the procedure. No major complications were observed. In conclusion, percutaneous vertebroplasty with PMMA proved to be safe and beneficial, providing significant and early improvement in the functional status of patients with spinal metastasis."

CD008686,0,12672282,0,Neurolymphomatosis.,"The term ""neurolymphomatosis"" (NL) has included infiltration of the peripheral nervous system by lymphoma and nontumor lymphocytes. We describe NL as a lymphoma entity that affects cranial and peripheral nerves and roots. We reviewed the medical records of patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) who registered between 1972 and 2000, as well as cases published in the English-language literature. Inclusion criteria were (A) histopathologic demonstration of lymphoma within peripheral nerve, nerve root/plexus, or cranial nerve or (B) CT/MRI or intraoperative evidence of nerve enlargement and/or enhancement beyond the dural sleeve in the setting of prior or concurrent lymphoma in systemic or CNS sites. We identified 25 patients with NL in addition to 47 reported by others. Four clinical presentations were (1) painful involvement of nerves or roots, (2) cranial neuropathy with or without pain, (3) painless involvement of peripheral nerves, (4) painful or painless involvement of a single peripheral nerve. Twenty of our patients and 44 of those reported had histopathologic confirmation of lymphoma infiltrating root or nerve. In the remainder, diagnosis was based upon clinical presentation, nodular nerve enlargement or enhancement, and lymphoma cells in spinal fluid or extraneural sites. For antemortem diagnosis, imaging studies were of greatest utility, followed by biopsy. Thirty-three patients of the combined series were not correctly diagnosed until postmortem examination. Systemic chemotherapy was used to address the multiple potential sites of involvement. When properly treated, NL carries a prognosis similar to primary CNS lymphoma in the modern era."

CD008686,0,12669777,0,Comparative evaluation of safety and efficacy of pamidronate and zoledronic acid in multiple myeloma patients (single center experience).,"Osteolytic bone destruction, caused by the aberrant production and activation of osteoclasts, results in significant morbidity for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Pamidronate [(3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene)-1,1-bis-phosphonate] inhibits osteoclastic activity and reduces bone resorption. A potency of zoledronic acid (2-[imidazol-1-yl]-1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid, a new third generation bisphosphonate, as inhibitor of resorption was 850-fold greater than pamidronate, as was shown in preclinical models of bone resorption. Randomized, double-blind study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid and pamidronate for treating myeloma bone disease. Since March 1999 the efficacy and safety of pamidronate and zoledronic acid is evaluated in MM patients all receiving anti-myeloma chemotherapy acc. to VMCP/VBAP alternating regimen. Nine patients with stage III myeloma and osteolytic lesions (3 female, 6 male, median age 57 years, range 52-67, with monoclonal protein: IgG-7, IgA-2) were randomly assigned (1:1:1 ratio) to treatment with either 4 or 8 mg of zoledronic acid via 15-minute intravenous infusion or 90 mg of pamidronate via 2-hour intravenous infusion every 3 to 4 weeks for 12 months. All patients have received 500 mg of calcium supplements and 500 IU of vit.D, orally, once daily, for the duration of administration of study medication. In extension phase of the study (June 2000-April 2002) patients did not received bisphosphonates. In 7 patients 18 cycles of assessed treatment was administered to each of them and one patient received 16 cycles. One patient died after receiving of 12 pamidronate therapy cycles at 11 month of the trial duration (and at 49 month since MM diagnosis and anti-tumour treatment). The patient's death occurred during the progression of plasma cell proliferation due to acute left ventricle cardiac failure. During the 12-month-period of bisphosphonate treatment skeletal related events (SRE) and progression of osteolysis occurred with the same frequency in 3 treatment groups. One patient experienced spinal cord compression and received radiation to bone and 2 patients experienced vertebral fracture. Time from study entry to the first SRE was 304 days in pamidronate and 366 and 392 days in 4 and 8 mg zoledronic acid group, respectively. The skeletal morbidity rate was identical in all treatment groups. Single hypocalcemic events occurred in 2 patients, mild hypertransaminasemia was observed in 3, worsening of renal function parameters in 2 patients (transient in one of them). Muscular pain and fever up to 39 degrees C (transient and self-limiting ""flu-like"" symptoms) occurred in 6 patients after several or some dozens of hours from study drug administration. Adverse events were similar in nature and frequency with zoledronic acid and pamidronate and were experienced by a similar proportion of patients in each treatment group. Median time of patient's observation duration after completing of administered treatment with zoledronic acid and pamidronate amounts to 20 months. At present actual median survival time of analysed patients since MM diagnosis is 42 months, since the beginning of treatment with pamidronate and zoledronic acid--33 months, and since completing treatment--20 months and is similar in 3 treatment groups. As was shown in our single center study in MM patients the safety and efficacy of pamidronate 90 mg and zoledronic acid 4 mg and 8 mg in monthly i.v. infusion are comparable. Thus the recommended dosage of zoledronic acid is 4 mg administered as a 15 minute i.v. infusion at intervals of 3 to 4 weeks."
CD008686,0,12665949,0,Clinical evaluation of Luque's segmental spinal instrumentation for upper cervical metastases.,"We reviewed clinical data from eight patients with upper cervical metastases who were treated with an occipitocervical fusion procedure using Luque's segmental spinal instrumentation with a fan-shaped rod. All patients had diffuse involvement of the entire anterior vertebral body, extreme instability at C1/2, and severe preoperative neck pain, but no neurological deficits. This procedure provided significant postoperative pain relief, with only one patient experiencing deterioration. The activities of daily living (ADL) levels of four patients improved; ADLs in four patients who were severely impaired were unchanged. Even though tissue destruction continued after surgery, this procedure prevented further deformity and instability. There were two major surgical complications: respiratory quadriplegia and hydro-cephalic coma. Great care must be taken to avoid these problems. Of the various instrumentation possibilities now available, we strongly advocate consideration of this particular stabilization procedure for upper cervical metastases to provide dying patients with an optimal quality of life during their final days."

CD008686,0,12664066,0,Periprostatic local anesthesia eliminates pain of office-based transrectal prostate biopsy.,"Up to 96% of patient who undergo prostate biopsy report pain. We performed periprostatic local anesthesia injection in an effort to improve patient acceptance of prostate biopsy. Sixty patients were randomized to receive either local injection of lidocaine in the periprostatic nerves or no anesthetic. Lidocaine was injected through a 7-inch spinal needle placed through a transrectal ultrasound biopsy guide. Ten-core biopsies were immediately performed. Following biopsy, all patients gave a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) assessment of their pain experienced during biopsy.A majority of patients reported Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores in the moderate (28.6%) or severe (28.6%) ranges unless local anesthesia was given. Only one of 27 patients (3.7%) receiving local anesthetic reported moderate pain, and none reported severe pain. Mean VAS pain scores were 1.4 in the anesthetic group and 4.5 in the control group (P<0.0001). No difficulty was encountered from scarring in the five patients who underwent nerve spring radical retropubic prostatectomy following local anesthetic injection. Periprostatic injection of local anesthetic essentially eliminates pain from prostate biopsy. Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy is not more difficult as a result."

CD008686,0,12658486,0,Paravertebral block anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair.,"Choice of anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair remains a controversial topic. Local anesthesia has been described in the literature as the optimal technique, however general and spinal anesthesia are commonly used in practice despite well-known complications and side effects. The regional technique of paravertebral block has been successfully used at our institution for the operative treatment of breast cancer. Its attributes are prolonged sensory block with minimization of postoperative pain, reduction of nausea and vomiting, shortened hospital stay, patient satisfaction, and rapid return to normal activities. These features are desirable in the practice of ambulatory hernia surgery; hence we initiated the use of thoracic/lumbar paravertebral block for that surgical procedure. Paravertebral block anesthesia was performed on 30 consecutive patients. Block placement took an average of 12.3 minutes, in six cases repeat injection at one or two spinal levels was required due to incomplete blockade. Paravertebral block achieved effective anesthesia in 28 of 30 cases; conversion to general anesthesia was performed for two failed blocks. We are reporting postoperative data on the 28 completed blocks. Supplementation of intravenous sedation or injection of local anesthesia successfully treated transient intraoperative pain in 10 cases. Epidural extension of anesthesia resulting in lower limb numbness and motor weakness delayed the discharge of two patients. There were no other complications of anesthesia and no cases of urinary retention. TIme to onset of pain averaged 15 hours, while duration of sensory block was 13 hours. Patients were prescribed a standing order of naproxen 500 mg B.I.D. for 4 days regardless of pain; supplemental oral narcotic use during the 48 hours following surgery averaged 3.5 tablets, with 6 patients not requiring any narcotic. ninety-six percent of patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery were discharged from the postanesthesia care unit, with an average stay of 2.5 hours. Employed patients returned to work on day 5.5 (range 3-10 days); patients who were not employed returned to regular activities in 5.8 days (range 1-14 days). Eighty-two percent of patients reported being ""very satisfied"" with the anesthetic technique."
CD008686,0,12658474,0,[Atypical Leriche syndrome].,"A 73-year old woman presented with mild paraparesis and hypesthesia of the legs. Furthermore, she complained dizziness, fainting and dyspnea. There was a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. Five years ago she had breast cancer with removal of the left mamma and additional radiation therapy. Cardiac catheterization at that time demonstrated no significant coronary stenoses. A contrast-enhanced CT-scan excluded lumbal spinal metastases. Instead, a subtotal occlusion of the abdominal aorta was noticed, but was initially interpreted as a chronic thrombosis because there were no typical symptoms and only moderate pain. About 24 hours later the patient developed an acute ischemic syndrome of the legs with progressive paraparesis, cold and pale legs in combination with acidosis and hyperventilation. Color-coded duplex ultrasound showed only a small turbulent flow in the ilial arteries, highly suspicious of a complete occlusion of the distal aorta. Angiography revealed an acute total occlusion of the infrarenal aorta without collaterals. During surgical intervention, complete obstruction of the abdominal aorta above the bifurcation was confirmed. Subsequent embolectomy was performed and an embolus consisting of several layers of different age was extracted. After successful surgical intervention with subsequent clinical improvement, the patient's clinical condition deteriorated a few day later. She died on day 9 after surgery from a complete ischemia of the small intestine and the colon ascendens."

CD008686,0,12630341,0,[Neurologic sequelae of bone changes in multiple myeloma and its therapy].,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by infiltration of bone marrow, bone destruction, infiltration of soft tissues with plasma cells, and suppression of normal hematopoiesis. The production of monoclonal immunoglobulins with or without light chains is a major feature of the disease. Full spectrum of plasma cell dyscrasias include monoclonal gammapathy of undetermined significance, smouldering myeloma, indolent multiple myeloma, and fully developed, symptomatic multiple myeloma. The usual presenting features of MM include bone pain, weakness, fatigue, fever and infection. Neurologic symptoms are less common but one must not forget that MM may present with a neurologic disease. Careful neurologic history and examination are mandatory in patients with MM. Neurologic symptoms may be a direct manifestation of MM or may be due to the immune effect of monoclonal proteins directed against different neural structures. Finally, metabolic consequences (uremia, hypercalcemia, hyperviscosity) of MM may produce a broad spectrum of different neurologic symptoms including headache, blurring of vision, drowsiness, precoma, coma, vertigo, ataxia, hemiparesis and epileptiform seizures. The most common location of bone changes in MM is the thoracic spine, where it causes osteolytic changes with consequent compressive fractures. The most disastrous sequel is paraplegia. Multiple vertebral involvement with the evidence of osteolytic changes in other bones is usual, but solitary vertebral myeloma may occur. Myeloma usually involves the bone of the vertebral body and then spreads into the extradural space. However, patients with solitary extradural myeloma have been reported. Skull myeloma is frequently asymptomatic. It may grow externally or, rarely, there is intracranial expansion. Involvement of the cranial nerves is not rare, with II, V, VI, VII and VIII cranial nerves being most often affected. Isolated intracerebral plasmacytomas are extremely rare. Diagnostic approach includes plain X-rays of the skeleton, which was found to be the method of choice for demonstration of osteolytic changes, whereas magnetic resonance with gadolinium enhancement most reliably displays the degree of vertebral involvement and demonstrates any associated soft tissue mass. Current treatment of osteolytic changes in multiple myeloma include chemotherapy, radiotherapy in combination with dexamethasone, monthly infusions of bisphosphonates, surgical decompression, and kyphoplasty. Therapeutic approach is dictated by the presenting symptoms. In case of pain as the predominant symptom, treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be appropriate. Compressive symptoms are relieved with dexamethasone followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgical decompression is used in patients with vertebral collapse and vertebral instability. Kyphoplasty is a new method used in the treatment of osteolytic changes of vertebral bodies. A viscous cement is injected into the cavity by a balloon-like inflatable bone tampon. It has been successfully employed to improve the quality of life, to reduce pain, and to increase overall functioning in patients with vertebral compression fractures by restoring most of the original height of the vertebral body. Bisphosphonates reduce pain associated with osteolytic changes in multiple myeloma, but also significantly reduce skeletal events (pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery or irradiation of bone) via unknown mechanism. It seems that bisphosphonates, by inhibiting bone resorption, alter the microenvironment in which the MM cells grow."
CD008686,0,12627783,0,Imaging neuroblastoma in children.,"Neuroblastoma is a common solid tumor of childhood that can involve the abdomen, thorax, pelvis, or the head and neck. The clinical manifestations are dependent on the widespread distribution of neural crest tissue and the length of the sympathetic chain involvement. Abdominal pain and hypertension may occur as a result of renal vasculature compression; respiratory distress may be evident in thoracic tumors; and Homer's syndrome or heterochromia of the iris may manifest from neuroblastoma of the head and neck. In addition, symptoms of cord compression and back pain may result from spinal cord compromise due to epidural invasion. Metastatic involvement of the liver, skin, periorbital regions, or bone may cause hepatomegaly, skin nodules, proptosis, or bone marrow failure, respectively. Clinical findings along with tumor metastasis may be studied by various imaging modalities to assess the nature and extent of the tumor. Diagnostic tests include plain radiography, ultrasonography, CT scanning, and MR imaging. Bone marrow studies, bone scans, and scintigraphy with 131I-metaiodobenzylmandelic may be utilized for metastatic evaluation. By using these imaging studies to detect the nature and behavior of neuroblastoma, early intervention may indeed improve patient survival."
CD008686,0,12617697,0,Therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in CNS disease.,"The major psychoactive constituent of Cannabis sativa, delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta(9)-THC), and endogenous cannabinoid ligands, such as anandamide, signal through G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors localised to regions of the brain associated with important neurological processes. Signalling is mostly inhibitory and suggests a role for cannabinoids as therapeutic agents in CNS disease where inhibition of neurotransmitter release would be beneficial. Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients with disorders such as multiple sclerosis smoke cannabis to relieve disease-related symptoms. Cannabinoids can alleviate tremor and spasticity in animal models of multiple sclerosis, and clinical trials of the use of these compounds for these symptoms are in progress. The cannabinoid nabilone is currently licensed for use as an antiemetic agent in chemotherapy-induced emesis. Evidence suggests that cannabinoids may prove useful in Parkinson's disease by inhibiting the excitotoxic neurotransmitter glutamate and counteracting oxidative damage to dopaminergic neurons. The inhibitory effect of cannabinoids on reactive oxygen species, glutamate and tumour necrosis factor suggests that they may be potent neuroprotective agents. Dexanabinol (HU-211), a synthetic cannabinoid, is currently being assessed in clinical trials for traumatic brain injury and stroke. Animal models of mechanical, thermal and noxious pain suggest that cannabinoids may be effective analgesics. Indeed, in clinical trials of postoperative and cancer pain and pain associated with spinal cord injury, cannabinoids have proven more effective than placebo but may be less effective than existing therapies. Dronabinol, a commercially available form of delta(9)-THC, has been used successfully for increasing appetite in patients with HIV wasting disease, and cannabinoid receptor antagonists may reduce obesity. Acute adverse effects following cannabis usage include sedation and anxiety. These effects are usually transient and may be less severe than those that occur with existing therapeutic agents. The use of nonpsychoactive cannabinoids such as cannabidiol and dexanabinol may allow the dissociation of unwanted psychoactive effects from potential therapeutic benefits. The existence of other cannabinoid receptors may provide novel therapeutic targets that are independent of CB(1) receptors (at which most currently available cannabinoids act) and the development of compounds that are not associated with CB(1) receptor-mediated adverse effects. Further understanding of the most appropriate route of delivery and the pharmacokinetics of agents that act via the endocannabinoid system may also reduce adverse effects and increase the efficacy of cannabinoid treatment. This review highlights recent advances in understanding of the endocannabinoid system and indicates CNS disorders that may benefit from the therapeutic effects of cannabinoid treatment. Where applicable, reference is made to ongoing clinical trials of cannabinoids to alleviate symptoms of these disorders."
CD008686,0,12602073,0,[A child whose parents denied her psychiatric care].,"A 15-year-old girl was admitted because of an abdominal tumour and inability to eat. History revealed that after an accident at 9 years of age she increasingly developed medically unexplained signs and symptoms (e.g. tunnel vision with blindness, paralysis and loss of sensitivity below the umbilicus, periods of diminished consciousness). No somatic explanation could be found; the parents rejected psychiatric examination. Upon physical examination the patient's weight's was far below the third percentile (32 kg) and the tumour appeared to be the lumbar spine, palpable through the abdominal wall. Following tube feeding and behavioural therapy the girl gained weight and the tumour disappeared. No cause for the underweight was found. Conversion disorder was diagnosed. However, the parents strongly refused to accept this diagnosis; they lodged complaints with various bodies and made further treatment and counseling impossible. Children with psychological problems who were treated as having a somatic disorder by their mothers have been described before. The outcome can be lethal. Children showing unexplained signs and symptoms whose parents strongly refuse psychiatric care will be seriously jeopardised in terms of their somatic and psychological development. Physicians should identify this situation at an early stage."

Cervical magnetic resonance images disclosed the lesion extended from retropharyngeal space and multiple vertebral bodies to epidural space of the spinal canal, which was enhanced by gadolinium. Not only fever elevation during clinical course but also inflammatory reaction on selologic examination were not identified, so we initially thought the lesion metastatic spinal tumor. In researching original foci, his clinical condition worsened with gate disturbance and urinary incontinence. Eleven days later after admission, laminectomy from C-5 to Th-1 and open biopsy of the lesion was performed. The vertebral bodies exposed via the right frontal approach were covered by thick whitish membrane. Small mount of pus emerged after incision of the membrane, so we diagnosed the lesion pyogenic spondylitis. After the operation, high dose antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks was performed. Follow-up cervical MR imaging 4 months after the operation found that the volume of the lesion and compression of the spinal cord were reduced. The gate disturbance and urinary incontinence gradually improved, he was able to walk with a cane 6 months later."

CD008686,0,12587616,0,Use of the laryngeal mask airway in combination with regional anesthesia facilitates induction and emergence from general anesthesia in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.,"The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is selected as an alternative to the endotracheal tube (ETT) when rapid recovery from general anesthesia is considered. However, the clinical significance of this airway for abdominal surgery is unclear. Thus, we evaluated whether the LMA, in combination with regional anesthesia, facilitates the induction of and emergence from general anesthesia in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Anesthesia-controlled time in a ETT/Epidural Anesthesia (EA) group [n = 11; general anesthesia, combined with epidural anesthesia, was maintained by sevoflurane (< 3%) supplemented with a fixed rate of propofol (3 mg/kg/h) under controlled ventilation using the ETT] was compared with that in a LMA/Combined Spinal-Epidural Anesthesia (CSEA) group [n = 10; in combination with spinal-epidural anesthesia, general anesthesia was maintained as the same protocol as the ETT/EA under spontaneous ventilation using the LMA]. Time for airway placement in the LMA/CSEA group was significantly shorter than that in the ETT/EA group. Intervals from the end of surgery until the removal of the airway or the decision to exit the operating room in the LMA/CSEA group were shorter than those in the ETT/EA group. No practical sign of aspiration pneumonia and/or atelectasis was found in patients in either group. Under the circumstance of regional anesthesia being requested for post-surgical pain management, we concluded that the LMA facilitated the emergence from as well as the induction of anesthesia without any practical complication when used for patients in colorectal surgery."

He had manifested with lumbago, high-grade fever, and confusion. Physical examination on admission showed disorientation and severe back pain. There were neither lymphadenopathy nor hepatosplenomegaly. Routine laboratory tests showed moderate pancytopenia, hypercalcemia (serum calcium, 15.9 mg/dL), IgM lambda-type monoclonal gammopathy (IgG, 405 mg/dL; IgA, 42 mg/dL; and IgM, 2023 mg/dL), and lambda-type Bence-Jones protein in the urine (0.8 g/d). Bone marrow biopsy showed the clusters of surface lambda-positive small-sized mature-appearing lymphoplasmacytoid cells. Bone survey and computed tomographic scan showed multiple osteolytic lesions and a tumor involving the third lumbar spine (L3). An open biopsy of the L3 tumor showed diffuse proliferation of CD20- and lambda-positive large cells. We thus diagnosed the patient as simultaneously having LPL and DLBCL. Although the combination chemotherapy was at least partially effective, he died of bacteremia and organ failure after three courses of chemotherapy. To clarify the clonal relatedness between LPL and DLBCL, we analyzed the sequences of the complementarity-determining region 3 in immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. The data showed that LPL and DLBCL in the present patient originated from two independent clones."
CD008686,0,12571494,0,Thoracolumbopelvic stabilization for the treatment of instability caused by recurrent myxopapillary ependymoma.,"The authors report a patient with recurrent lumbosacral myxopapillary ependymoma, followed for more than 20 years, who presented with severe axial pain resulting from osteolytic destruction at the lumbosacral junction. Because the patient had a long history of paraplegia despite three previous incomplete tumor resections, we chose not to attempt a fourth resection. Moreover, because viable fixation points were not present within the sacrum and most of the lumbar spine, instrumented fusion was extended from T7 to the ilia using a modified Galveston L-rod technique, which we believe to be unique in its application to this problem. This case demonstrates the long-term potential for instability from locally destructive myxopapillary ependymoma that is incompletely excised. We are not aware of any previous reports of lumbopelvic instability in association with myxopapillary ependymomas."

Report of two clinical cases].,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease characterized by a high rate of spontaneous mutations involving at least two loci: TSC(1) (9q34) and TSC(2) (16p13). It results in hamartomas or tumours which can affect a variety of organs, most commonly the brain, skin and kidneys. At least half of patients with TSC have underlying renal pathology, most commonly angiomyolipomas (AML) and/or cysts with, more rarely, adenocarcinoma, but oncocytomas, sarcomas, interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis have all been reported. Renal disorders may be asymptomatic or associated with acute lumbar ache, hematuria, abdominal mass, retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Renal failure is infrequent. The diagnosis of this disease is often performed, as in the present cases, very late and it is made possible by radiological examinations such as TC scan o RMI (when renal failure is present), usually performed after macrohaematuria or abdominal or renal colics or renal failure. When fatty tissue cannot be demonstrated within renal lesion (as in the female case), biopsy can be undertaken to exclude malignancy. Histology at the edge of an AML may look like renal carcinoma, but recent studies suggest that it can be differentiated by staining for HMB-45 which is positive in AML and negative in carcinoma. Two cases of tuberous sclerosis with different neurological fenotype, with bilateral renal angiomyolipomatosis and heavy renal failure, are presented."

CD008686,0,12507700,0,Cancer breakthrough pain characteristics and responses to treatment at a VA medical center.,"The purpose of this study is to analyze cancer breakthrough pain (BP) characteristics and how BP responds to conventional cancer pain management. Seventy-four cancer pain patients with worst pain severity >or=4 out of 10 completed the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form, Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy and Breakthrough Pain Questionnaires (BPQ) at an initial interview. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) cancer pain management guidelines were followed. Pain syndromes and morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) orally were determined. One-week follow-up assessments were obtained in 66 patients with BPI and BPQ. The BP characteristics were similar at both time points. On day 1, 52 patients (70%) had BP, and the BP was unpredictable in 30 patients (58%). The median time to worst BP severity was 3 min. Patients with BP had significantly higher worst pain (P<0.001). At week 1, the median MEDD doubled from 60 to 120 mg orally, and the number of patients who received adjuvant analgesics doubled from 31.1% (23 patients) on day 1 to 62.2% (41 patients). At week 1, 21 patients (32%) remained without BP, 21 patients (32%) were classified as BP responders and 24 patients (36%) were BP non-responders. The mean pain relief was similar for all three subgroups, i.e. around 80%. Compared to BP responders, BP non-responders had significantly higher worst pain (P<0.0001), average pain (P<0.004), and higher BPI interference parameters and shorter time to worst pain severity. The study confirmed the applicability of the BPQ to an US veteran population, and that pain management following the AHCPR guidelines is effective for a group of patients with cancer related BP. Underlying pain syndromes and the BP location may influence the response of BP to treatment. Patients with bone pain located in the spine, back, and pelvis may be at risk for resistant BP."

CD008686,0,12496513,0,Musculoskeletal manifestations of benign and malignant tumors of bone.,"Benign and malignant tumors of bone often have common musculoskeletal manifestations mimicking rheumatic disorders. The detection and resolution of mimicking symptoms require knowledge, skills, and a problem-solving attitude for musculoskeletal disorders. Before engaging in an extensive investigation, a careful history and full physical examination must be done. This review addresses the recent literature from June 2001 to May 2002 on musculoskeletal manifestations of benign and malignant tumors of bone using ""red flag"" rubrics: nonspecific pain pattern, atypical soft-tissue or bony swellings, pathologic fracture, spinal paresis, osteolytic x-ray findings, and unexpected results of laboratory tests. Early diagnosis (appropriate use of imaging techniques) and multidisciplinary management have improved considerably the survival of patients with primary malignant bone disease (eg, osteosarcoma). For some benign bone tumors (eg, osteoid osteoma), interstitial laser photocoagulation is now the treatment of choice with a success rate comparable with that of other treatments."
CD008686,0,12493147,0,Standard and novel radiotherapeutic approaches to neoplastic meningitis.,"Neoplastic meningitis usually occurs late in the natural history of cancer. Adequate staging and assessment of the patient's overall reserves and prognosis are crucial in determining whether aggressive treatment is justified. Although radiotherapy remains the single most effective treatment, it is considered palliative for epithelial cancers and is generally directed to sites of bulky disease that obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid or cause neurologic dysfunction. Such diseases as leukemia, medulloblastoma, and germinoma are exceptions that can be treated definitively with craniospinal irradiation. Innovations in conformal therapy may help to reduce the significant amount of myelosuppression associated with spinal irradiation. The main long-term toxicity associated with whole-brain irradiation (WBI) is dementia resulting from leukoencephalopathy, which may be exacerbated when WBI is given in combination with chemotherapy. A case report highlighting the use of radiotherapy for palliation in a patient with neoplastic meningitis is presented at the end of this article."
CD008686,0,12487620,0,Responsible prescribing of opioids for the management of chronic pain.,"The management of patients with chronic pain is a common clinical challenge. Indeed, chronic pain is often inadequately controlled in patients with cancer and in those with non-cancer chronic pain. Because of the complex nature of chronic pain, successful long-term treatment is more difficult than for acute pain. Most often acute pain is nociceptive, whereas chronic pain can be nociceptive (i.e., in response to noxious stimuli), neuropathic (i.e., initiated by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system) or mixed in origin. Opioids are the current standard of care for the treatment of moderate or severe nociceptive pain. Opioids mediate their actions by binding and activating receptors both in the peripheral nervous system and those that are found in inhibitory pain circuits that descend from the midbrain to the spinal cord dorsal horn. Opioid agonists exert a number of physiological responses including analgesia, which increases with increasing doses. The use of opioids to manage pain in patients with cancer is well accepted. The WHO step-wise algorithm for analgesic therapy based on pain severity reserves the use of opioid therapy for moderate and severe pain. The WHO algorithm has proven to be highly effective for the management of cancer pain. However, the use of opioids to treat patients with chronic non-cancer pain is controversial because of concerns about efficacy and safety, and the possibility of addiction or abuse. The results of clinical surveys and retrospective case series involving patients with non-cancer chronic pain have been inconsistent in regard to resolving these controversial issues. The oral route of drug administration is most appropriate for patients receiving opioids; although rectal, transdermal and parenteral routes of administration are used in specific situations. For continuous chronic pain, opioids should be administered around-the-clock and several long-acting formulations are available that require administration only once or twice daily. Opioid doses should be titrated according to agent-specific schedules to maximise pain relief and maintain tolerability. Adverse effects include constipation, nausea and vomiting, sedation, cognitive impairment and respiratory depression. Tolerance to the analgesic and adverse effects as well as physical dependence, which causes withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuance, may occur with opioid use. Estimates of addiction rates among patients with chronic non-cancer pain range from 3.2 to 18.9%. Successful pain treatment and symptom management is an attainable goal for the majority of patients with chronic pain. Further controlled clinical trials are needed to define the role of opioid therapy in chronic non-cancer pain, and to establish criteria for patient selection and specific treatment algorithms."

In MRI, cystic lesions in the spinal cord were identified at C 1,C 6,T 1,T 6,and T 11 as well as in the cerebellum.A tentative diagnosis of spinal hemangioblastomas was confirmed by spinal angiography and postoperative histology of the symptomatic tumor at T11.Furthermore, retinal hemangioblastomas were detected by fluorescence angiography and treated with laser surgery. Based on the clinical findings,we assumed the diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (vHL).Postoperatively, the paraparesis and sensory deficit improved, but the bladder dysfunction persisted. The patient's identical twin was screened for hemangioblastomas, too, and spinal, retinal, and one cerebellar tumor with a nearly identical location pattern were found. There was no evidence for pancreatic, adrenal, or renal involvement in both twins. The twins were investigated for inactivating mechanisms of the vHL germline mutations using single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and Southern blotting, but none of the known germline mutations were identified. Because the family history is devoid of vHL disease, spontaneous mutation might be causal for the syndrome in our patients."

CD008686,0,12481453,0,[Spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine for a patient with a history of severe leg pain after intrathecal dibucaine].,"An 87-year-old man was scheduled for the 11th transurethral bladder tumor resection (TURBT). He had a history of non-active syphilis for 21 years, diabetes mellitus for 7 years, and severe emphysema. Preoperative physical examination of the lower extremities, revealed loss of knee-jerk reflex, and loss of vibratory and proprioceptive perception. Four years previously, he underwent TURBT twice under spinal anesthesia with dibucaine, which caused severe leg pain during anesthesia. Therefore, subsequent TURBTs (eight times) were performed under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation, which frequently caused postoperative respiratory distress. Recently, bupivacaine, less neurotoxic than dibucaine, was on the market in Japan for use in spinal anesthesia. Therefore we planned spinal anesthesia using 0.5% bupivacaine, 2.0 ml. This time, he did not complain of leg pain during anesthesia, and postoperative conditions were satisfactory. We can conclude that bupivacaine is very useful for spinal anesthesia especially in patients with a history of leg pain by spinal anesthesia with dibucaine."

In hemostatic markers, thrombin-antithrombin III complex(TAT; 106 ng/dl), D-dimer 1234 ng/dl, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2(F1 + 2; 2.36 nmol/L), beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG; 4,300 ng/dl) and platelet factor 4 (PF-4; 1,770 ng/dl) were extremely elevated. On duplex ultrasonography, a low echo lucent plaque was observed at the right internal carotid artery and the mean blood flow velocity in the right carotid artery was decreased. She was placed on oral prednisolone and warfarin for suspected stroke due to hypercoagulability associated with vasculitis. Afterwards, she discharged from our hospital. Two months later, she was readmitted to our hospital because of irregular menses and vaginal bleeding. Endometrial uterus biopsy was conducted, which revealed a grade I endometrioid adenocarcinoma. She was under total uterectomy without tumor recurrence. After the radical operation, white-cell count, RF, CRP, TAT, D-dimer, F1 + 2, and beta TG were normalized, and the mean flow velocity of the right common carotid artery was increased. Thereafter, she did not experience stroke recurrence. Therefore, we speculated that she had stroke due to hypercoagulability in association with malignancy, that is Trousseau's syndrome. We also assumed that aseptic meningitis, brainstem encephalitis associated with vasculitis in this patient are other clinical variants of paraneoplastic syndrome through immunological mechanisms associated with malignancy. We emphasize that patients with Trousseau's syndrome can be associated with other paraneoplastic manifestations such as vasculitis as seen in this patient."
CD008686,0,12463459,0,The role of etanercept in ankylosing spondylitis.,"Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to significant loss of function and disability in patients. Current conventional therapies have not demonstrated improvement in axial symptoms and progressive ankylosis of the spine. The use of new biologic agents that block the actions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha have, for the first time, reported significant improvement in axial symptoms and reduction in spinal inflammation in short-term studies. Future studies with larger numbers of patients over long periods of time will eventually determine the long-term success and safety of these agents."
CD008686,0,12457338,0,Manual percutaneous method for diagnosis of spinal tumors.,"Summary. In a patient with malignant tumors of bone it is common to perform biopsy prior to surgery. There are a number of alternatives available for obtaining a specimen for pathological examination. We have introduced the technique of manual percutaneous discectomy (MPD), as a method for taking material for analysis. In a series of 13 symptomatic patients harbouring suspected spinal tumors the MPD was done and the accurate diagnosis was confirmed in all of them. Only three patients had a minor transient complication. This method enables us to obtain sufficient pathological material for analysis and has minimal morbidity and it could have priority over the other methods."
CD008686,0,12453602,0,Slit ventricle syndrome after cyst-peritoneal shunting for temporal arachnoid cyst in children--a clinical entity difficult to detect on neuroimaging study.,"Slit ventricle syndrome, known to occur from malfunction of the shunt procedure for hydrocephalus, is reported after cyst-peritoneal shunt for temporal arachnoid cyst. Two children aged 12 and 10 years, who underwent cyst-peritoneal shunting for a large temporal arachnoid cyst at the age of 10 and 5 years, respectively, recently experienced several episodes of severe headache. Prior to admission, repeated CT scans did not reveal any morphological change in either of these two patients. Evidence of high intracranial pressure by lumbar tap revealed shunt malfunction. Both patients became free of neurological complaints and deficits after shunt revision. Despite elevated intracranial pressure due to shunt malfunction, neuroimaging studies showed no morphological changes in slit ventricle syndrome. Delay in both the diagnosis and prompt treatment may result in complete loss of visual acuity and even death. It is important to suspect this complication in patients with persistent elevated intracranial pressure symptoms and signs after any shunting procedure, regardless of unchanged neuroimaging studies. Once this is suspected, lumbar tap may be necessary and the choice of treatment is shunt revision."
CD008686,0,12452222,0,Anesthetic pain management in Siriraj Hospital: a retrospective review.,"Neural blockade has been used as the single method to anesthetize a part of the body or used in combination with general anesthesia to lessen perioperative pain. Currently, nerve blocks are used for diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic and prophylactic proposes for management of chronic, acute and cancer pain in a Pain Clinic. Reviewing the records of the 3,349 patients at Siriraj Pain Clinic, we found 2,662 and 687 cases had chronic and acute pain problems respectively, and only 646 patients were treated with anesthetic interventions during 1990 to 1998. They consisted of 317 male and 329 female. The techniques included stellate ganglion block, paravertebral nerve block, celiac plexus block, hypogastric plexus block, mesenteric plexus block, sacral nerve block, epidural steroid, lumbar sympathectomy, first and second thoracic sympatholysis, facet joints injection, sacroiliac joint injection, intravenous regional block with guanethidine or ketanserin, continuous opioid infusion, intravenous lidocaine infusion, and a phentolamine test. The common problems of pain included brachial plexus injury, chronic spinal pain, herpetic neuralgia, ischemic pain, central post-stroke pain, and causalgia. This retrospective review showed that 38 per cent of them reported 50 per cent pain relief with temporary effect. 34 per cent experienced good and satisfactory pain relief while 9 per cent reported excellent pain relief. 17 per cent did not gain benefit from any technique of pain relief and about 2 per cent could not be evaluated due to they did not return for follow-up. One serious complication after thoracic sympatholysis was brachial plexus injury. The neural blockade is proven to be one of the useful adjunct in the management of chronic pain but the selection of the technique is subjected to its critical appraisal."

CD008686,0,12420182,0,[Clinical manifestations of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH)].,"Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH, Forestier disease) is in most cases a harmless, asymptomatic disease characterized by a massive, noninflammatory ossification with intensive formation of osteophytes affecting ligaments, tendons, and fasciae, especially of the spinal column. If the disease becomes symptomatic at all, the leading complaints will usually be dysphagia in the sense of a lump in the throat and difficulty in swallowing. However, in rare cases the osteophytes may influence the laryngeal function ranging from hoarseness and immobility of the vocal cord to life-threatening inspiratory stridor. Such laryngeal manifestations are almost unknown."

On administration, back pain progressing to paraplegia was observed in all cases. Sphincter dysfunction was observed in two cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were most useful for the clinical diagnosis of spinal lymphoma. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma was revealed from immunohistochemical studies of bone biopsies. The patients' clinical stagings were IV in three and I E in one case. One case treated by surgery followed by chemotherapy (CMT) and radiation therapy (RT) resulted in progressive disease. RT followed by CMT was given in the other cases. Two cases showed a partial response and one died from progressive disease. In all cases, either surgical or radiation therapy was helpful for the amelioration of the patients' progressive paraplegia and sphincter dysfunction."
CD008686,0,12409711,0,Laparoscopic excision of a lower posterior mediastinal paraspinal mass: technique and feasibility of the laparoscopic approach.,"Paravertebral and paraspinal tumors in the posterior mediastinum are predominantly neurogenic in origin. The treatment comprises surgical extirpation. We report a case of a 40-year-old man with a 2-month history of pain epigastrium, radiating to the left scapula, and marked (10 kg) weight loss. Preoperative CT scan showed a paraspinal mass 8 cm in diameter at the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra. A CT scan-guided fine-needle aspiration cytologic analysis revealed the mass to be of neurogenic origin. Transabdominal laparoscopic excision of this lower posterior mediastinal neurogenic tumor was attempted and accomplished safely. The approach was through the left crural fibers, which were split to access the lower posterior mediastinum. Operating time was 122 minutes. Postoperatively, a left intercostal drain was inserted. The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day, after intercostal drain removal. Lower posterior mediastinal paraspinal tumors can be resected laparoscopically with careful preoperative investigation for tumor localization and a meticulous laparoscopic technique. A major advantage of transabdominal laparoscopic resection, as compared with open or thoracoscopic (VATS) excision, is that the patient recovers rapidly with minimal operative and anesthetic morbidity."

CD008686,0,12408400,0,Traumatic neuroma of the anterior cervical nerve root with no subjective episode of trauma. Report of four cases.,"The authors report four cases of traumatic neuroma in the cervical nerve root in patients with no history of trauma. In one case the patient presented with intractable pain in the left upper extremity and motor paresis of the left shoulder, and in another case the patient suffered neuropathic pain in the left forearm. In both cases, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed an intradural extramedullary mass lesion in the ipsilateral cervical nerve root; these MR imaging signals were similar to the intensity of the spinal cord. Intraoperatively, fusiform enlargement of the anterior cervical nerve root was detected in the subarachnoid space. Histological examination showed a meandering change of axons accompanied by mild axonal swelling and a thin myelin sheath, which are consistent with the typical pathological features of traumatic neuroma. Postoperatively, pain resolved in both cases. The authors also investigated two traumatic neuromas of the anterior cervical nerve root in autopsy cases in which there was no history of trauma and no significant neurological signs suggestive of traumatic neuroma. The authors conclude that traumatic neuroma of the anterior cervical nerve root may develop following an unnoticed minor brachial plexus injury at birth or a forgotten traction injury of the upper extremity in childhood, and the lesion may be accompanied by various case-specific clinical features."
CD008686,0,12408388,0,Surgical approach to anterior compression in the upper thoracic spine.,The anterior upper thoracic spine (T1-3) is difficult to access because most neurosurgeons are unfamiliar with the anatomy.

CD008686,0,12406428,0,Imaging and scoring in ankylosing spondylitis.,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the prototype of the spondyloarthritides (SpA). AS is a disease subset but also a possible outcome of SpA. Early diagnosis of sacroiliitis, the most frequent clinical symptom frequently accompanied by inflammatory back pain and other inflammatory lesions of the spine such as spondylitis and spondylodiscitis, can be visualized early by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Spinal inflammation can be demonstrated by MRI using either the fat-saturating short tau inversion recovery (STIR) technique or by application of the contrast agent gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). This is especially useful in early and active disease, in young women and in children, and for the differential diagnosis of septic sacroiliitis. Because of the efficacy of the novel biological agents directed against tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) - such as infliximab and etanercept - in SpA there is a need for spinal imaging techniques more sensitive than conventional X-rays. The available scoring tools are reviewed and novel approaches using MRI are presented."
CD008686,0,12402484,0,[A case of primary malignant lymphoma of the pararectal space].,"A 16-year-old man presented with lumbago, perianal pain and constipation. A large tumor was palpable by digital rectal examination. Then, transrectal needle biopsies of the tumor were performed. Histopathological diagnosis was non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell type according to the new WHO classification). The results of some examinations were compatible with the diagnosis of primary lymphoma of the pararectal space. The patient underwent 2 courses of combination chemotherapy CHOP (consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubichin, vincristine, and prednisolone), and high-dose chemotherapy (ranimustine, etoposide, ifosfamide) with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. After high-dose chemotherapy, radiation therapy was performed since there was a possibility of residual tumor, and complete remission was achieved. Now, 12 months after completion of the radiation, he remains free of the disease. This is probably the first clinical case of malignant lymphoma of the pararectal space ever reported in the Japanese literature."
CD008686,0,12402477,0,[A case of erythropoietin-producing renal cell carcinoma with polycythemia].,"The patient was a 46-year-old man with gross hematuria and left lumbar pain. Computed tomography revealed a large left renal tumor with hemorrhage. Serological examination revealed polycythemia and a high erythropoietin level. After left radical nephrectomy, polycythemia and serologically high level of erythropoietin disappeared. Histopathological findings showed renal cell carcinoma composed of spindle cells. Based on the above mentioned clinical course, we diagnosed this case as erythropoietin-producing renal cell carcinoma with polycythemia. It is suggested that erythropoietin not only causes polycythemia but also stimulates proliferation of the tumor, because the majority of erythropoietin-producing renal cell carcinomas have been reported to be highly advanced. This patient had no evidence of disease one year after the operation."

We report on a 17-year-old female patient who presented with a 2-year history of persistent low back pain. The radiographic evaluation and bone scan failed to reveal a pathologic process. Magnetic resonance of the painful area and subsequent computed tomography scan showed a well-circumscribed osteolytic lesion originating from the spinous process and extending into both laminae of T9 vertebra. Aneurysmal bone cyst or osteoblastoma was considered to be the most probable diagnosis. The patient underwent excisional biopsy of the tumor. The intraoperative findings were suggestive of solitary bone cyst, a diagnosis that was confirmed histologically. Because the tumor had not invaded the articular facets, no posterolateral spine fusion was required. The patient had an unremarkable postoperative clinical course. Her symptoms resolved and she returned to her previous level of physical activities. Unicameral bone cysts, although uncommon, should be included in the differential diagnosis of an osteolytic lesion involving the spine."

Despite the rarity of diseases discussed in this article, at some time in his or her career every musculoskeletal physiatrist will see patients with these diagnoses as the cause of radiculopathy or back pain. A high index of suspicion is necessary to identify these rare disease processes accurately and promptly. The patient's history, examination, and plain-film radiographic evaluations remain the best tools with which to establish a differential and working diagnosis. The most important services that the physiatrist can provide to these patients are an astute application of the differential diagnosis to identify the specific etiology and the leadership required to organize a multi-disciplinary team of specialists to address all of the patient's needs."

The patient had a long history of coagulopathy due to factor VIII deficiency and pain in the right lumbar region. Computed axial tomography demonstrated a cystic mass in the right adrenal gland. Histological examination of the surgically removed cyst showed the presence of histiocytes containing Leishmania amastigotes. Serodiagnosis for leishmaniasis performed through immunofluorescent antibody testing and the rK39 enzyme immunoassay was positive, whereas a bone marrow aspirate did not reveal any parasite. The patient was not treated for leishmaniasis and recovered well after surgery. Serological testing was still positive 2 years after surgery, but clinical follow-up did not reveal the signs typical of visceral leishmaniasis."

The patient, with a chronic history of diabetes mellitus, was admitted to our hospital with lumbago, and a diagnosis of renal-cell carcinoma with bone metastasis was made. In hospital he had sudden onset of high fever and erythema, followed by the formation of flaccid bullae and exfoliation, with a positive Nikolsky sign. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), producing exfoliative toxin B, was isolated from blood and bile cultures, and Aeromonas hydrophila was isolated from bile culture. Skin biopsy specimen showed a cleavage of the epidermis at the level of the granular layer. The patient was diagnosed as having SSSS and cholecystitis, and was treated with intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage, which led to recovery. SSSS in adults is usually associated with immunosuppression. A. hydrophila is recognized as an opportunistic pathogen. SSSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of immunocompromised adult patients with sudden onset of high fever and erythema."

We report two patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) who developed post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) and SDH following intrathecal methotrexate (MTX). Both patients initially had normal computed tomography (CT) scan findings at the onset of headache. The diagnosis was established only when a repeat CT brain scan was performed for deteriorating neurological signs coinciding with improving platelet counts. These cases demonstrate the importance of continued vigilance for the early recognition of this salvageable entity. A normal initial CT finding and platelet count do not exclude the occurrence of SDH. A repeat CT scan, or even magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are indicated if the clinical suspicion remains strong."

CD008686,0,12366657,0,Surgical treatment of low stage cervical carcinoma: back to the old days?,"Radical hysterectomies for the treatment of cervical carcinoma are being performed laparoscopically by some surgeons. Others combine the laparoscopic lymphadenectomy with a radical vaginal hysterectomy or a radical trachelectomy, like in the Schauta procedure. In this way the procedure resembles the AVRUEL-procedure (Abdominal Vaginal Radical Uterus Extirpation with transperitoneal Lymphadenectomy), as developed in 1957 by Sindram who combined the Wertheim and the Schauta procedure together with abdominal lymphadenectomy in one single operation. Because of the high complication rate in the form of voiding problems and sexual impairment caused by the Schauta part, this operation is no longer performed. In order to pay attention to the morbidity associated in the past with the combined abdomino-vaginal approach compared to the single abdominal approach, we reassembled the data of several large Dutch centers where patients were treated either by the AVRUEL or the abdominal radical hysterectomy. A total of 730 patients underwent an AVRUEL procedure, all carried out between 1957 and 1981. Fistulas occurred in 57 patients (7.8%), long-term urologic complications in 233 patients (32%), and sexual dysfunction in 71 (9.7%) were found. A total of 928 patients underwent an abdominal radical hysterectomy, of whom in 511 cases the complication rates have been described. Twelve fistulas occurred (2%), long-term micturition problems in 55 (10%), and sexual problems in 11 (2%). There was no difference in 5-year survival rates in both groups. From the above-mentioned data it is clear, that returning to the old days in terms of a re-introduction of the Schauta procedure is not to be preferred. In order to conclude if the laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy or the trachelectomy are an improvement, they should be carried out according to clearly defined prospective protocols in which data can be compared to those of other techniques with special attention to late complications including micturition and sexual sequelae."

CD008686,0,12236201,0,Proposed diagnostic criteria and nosology of acute transverse myelitis.,"Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is a focal inflammatory disorder of the spinal cord, resulting in motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction. A set of uniform diagnostic criteria and nosology for ATM is proposed to avoid the confusion that inevitably results when investigators use differing criteria. This will ensure a common language of classification, reduce diagnostic confusion, and lay the groundwork necessary for multicenter clinical trials. In addition, a framework is suggested for evaluation of individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of ATM. Best treatment often depends on a timely and accurate diagnosis. Because acute transverse myelopathies are relatively rare, delayed and incomplete work-ups often occur. Rapid and precise diagnosis will ensure not only that compressive lesions are detected and treated but also that idiopathic ATM is distinguished from ATM secondary to a known underlying disease. Identification of etiologies may suggest medical treatment, whereas no clearly established medical treatment currently exists for idiopathic ATM. Establishment of a diagnostic algorithm will likely lead to improved care, although it is recognized that the entire evaluation may not be performed for each patient."

Various clinical conditions like trauma, infection (tuberculous, pyogenic, etc), malignancy, rheumatological diseases, neurological disorders and degenerative diseases produce back pain, and also some systemic illnesses cause the same. Radiological studies are very important for the diagnosis of back pain. Plain radiographs, myelography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scintigraphy are various radiological procedures often selected for diagnosis. Treatment modality comprises non-surgical and surgical methods. Non-surgical treatment consists of rest, pharmacological therapy, physical therapy and injection therapy.

CD008686,0,12198945,0,Symptomatic vertebral hemangioma: the treatment of 23 cases and a review of the literature.,"It is the purpose of this study to analyze a group of 23 patients affected with hemangioma in one or more metameres of the vertebral column. On the basis of clinical examination and instrumental testing in time (minimum follow-up 12 months, maximum 217 months) the following treatment options are discussed: medical treatment and clinical monitoring closer in time; palliative surgical treatment whether or not associated with embolization of vascular afferences of the lesion and adjuvant treatment; intralesional surgical treatment whether or not associated with embolization of the vascular afferences of the lesion and adjuvant treatment. Skeletal hemangioma is a hamartomatous proliferation of vascular tissue, more precisely of endothelial tissue. This is demonstrated by its anatomical identity with other tissues and the existence of exceptional skeletal and multiple tissue hemangiomatosis that begin during childhood. Hemangioma is the benign tumor that is most frequently localized in the spine, involving about 10% of the world population, as reported in the literature on autoptic studies. It is often a solitary lesion, usually localized in the vertebral body, although it may extend to the posterior arch. There is predilection for the thoracic region of the spine, while it less frequently occurs in the cervical and lumbar spines. Generally, it remains asymptomatic throughout the entire life of the subject, so much so that it is often difficult to establish the onset of the lesion. Symptomatic hemangiomas (less than 1% of all hemangiomas) are those that are accidentally discovered via radiograms; they are most often observed during adult age. The most common treatment used for vertebral hemangioma associated with pain is radiotherapy, even if clinical observation represents a reasonable choice. Surgical treatment, preceded when possible by embolization of the vascular afferences of the lesion, is often associated with radiation therapy in cases where there is neurologic compression in addition to pain. It was the purpose of this study to analyze the long-term results obtained in a group of 23 patients affected with symptomatic vertebral hemangioma."

The pathophysiology of malignant osteopathy occurs because of the secretion of substances (such as parathyroid hormone-related peptide), by the malignant cell, which stimulate osteoclast function; this in turn feeds further growth, which causes a vicious cycle. Interruption of this cycle by bisphosphonates may inhibit the growth of malignant cells. Bisphosphonates are drugs that inhibit bone turnover by decreasing bone resorption. Side effects of bisphosphonates include upper gastrointestinal symptoms (in oral nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates) and diarrhea (in oral non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates) and an acute phase-like reaction with intravenous (I.V.) pamidronate. Bisphosphonates have different molecular mechanisms of action: Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (eg, pamidronate and alendronate) inhibit the mevalonate-signaling pathway while the non-nitrogen-containing drugs (eg, clodronate) incorporate into adenosine triphosphate analogues. There is in vitro evidence that these drugs also possess anticancer properties. In hypercalcemia patients, treatment with pamidronate and zoledronate produce prompt and efficient normocalcemia. Intravenous pamidronate and zoledronate, oral clodronate, and ibandronate reduce skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases; I.V. pamidronate and clodronate are useful for bone pain relief. Three adjuvant bisphosphonate trials are discussed herein: 2 small open-label studies giving conflicting results and a large placebo-controlled trial of oral clodronate. This latter trial shows a reduction in the incidence of skeletal metastases (while the patients are on therapy) and an improved survival at 5 years."

CD008686,0,12192439,0,[Arachnoid cyst and tension headache: symptom or accidental finding?].,"We report a 34 year old male patient presenting with occipital headache and bilateral shoulder and neck pain. Cranial MRT discloses a large arachnoid cyst ventral to the medulla oblongata. The cyst displaces the caudal medulla oblongata dorsally to an angle of almost 90 degrees without causing myelopathy. Physical examination reveals normal neurological findings without any sign of brainstem lesions or lesions of the medulla oblongata. Orthopedic evaluation shows mild functional abnormalities as expected in tension headache. Multiple electrophysiologic investigations such as motor-, somatosensory-, and acoustic-evoked potentials, masseter and brain stem reflexes, and electromyography of the left M. trapezius were performed and reveal normal results. MR-angiography discloses displacement of the left vertebral artery to the right without stenosis.We discuss the possibility of a causal connection between the cystic lesion and the reported symptoms. Considering the findings based on a review of the available literature we conclude that the pain syndrome is very likely unrelated to the arachnoid cyst. The latter is herewith an accidental finding in a patient with tension headache, and underlines the importance of thoroughfull clinical examination to avoid unnecessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures."

CD008686,0,12167438,0,Intensity modulated radiation therapy for oropharyngeal and oral cavity tumors: clinical use and experience.,"Background and purpose. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) offers an opportunity to generate dose distributions highly conformal to the target volume. Head and neck cancer patients, referred for radiotherapy, may be good candidates to benefit from IMRT. This paper discusses the clinical implementation of IMRT for oropharyngeal and oral cavity tumors, and reports the clinical results of the 14 patients treated with this technique at Ghent University Hospital (GUH). Patients and Methods. Between May 1999 and May 2001, 14 patients were treated with IMRT at GUH for oropharyngeal or oral cavity tumors. Two groups of patients can be distinguished. The first group consists of eight patients re-irradiated with IMRT for a locoregional relapse. The second group of six patients were treated with IMRT for a primary tumor. For the first group, IMRT was used to treat the relapse by generating a concave dose distribution, i.e. to combine a homogeneous target re-irradiation with a dose to the spinal cord as low as possible. For the second group, IMRT was applied in order to achieve a more homogeneous dose distribution inside the PTV and to preserve parotid gland function. Results. The majority of the patients of group 1 (6/8) relapsed in field within four months after the end of the re-irradiation, with a median overall survival of 7 months. For group 2, two patients died shortly after the end of the IMRT treatment, the other four patients are free of tumor relapse with a median follow-up of 5 months (1-13 months). The acute toxicity due to radiation was acceptable for both patient groups. Dysphagia and pain was more present in group 1. Regarding late complications for the group of re-irradiations (group 1), no myelitis, carotid rupture or cranial nerve palsy was observed. One patient of group 1 developed osteoradionecrosis of the mandible and feeding tube dependency was present for another patient. No fatal late complications were observed in this group. For the first two patients of group 2, sparing of the parotid function was not a treatment objective. For the other patients of group 2, the mean dose to the contralateral parotid gland ranged from 17 to 25 Gy, which resulted in a decrease of subjective symptoms of xerostomia compared to patients treated with conventional radiotherapy. Conclusions. The implementation of IMRT for oropharyngeal and oral cavity tumors results in a homogeneous target irradiation and allows to re-irradiate locoregional relapses with acceptable adverse effects. Sparing of the parotid gland by IMRT is feasible, although this may be significantly influenced by the delineation method of the elective lymph node regions."
CD008686,0,12166355,0,Clinical management of hydatid disease of the urinary tract.,"This study reviews urinary hydatid disease in seven males and three females (mean age, 32.1 +/- 17.7 years; range, 7-67 years). Cysts were located in the kidney in six cases (one also involved the liver), the paravesical and retrovesical region in two cases (one coexisted with a bladder tumour), the adrenal gland (one case) and in the right parapelvic region (one case). Investigations included urinalysis, eosinophil count, Casoni skin test, indirect haemagglutination test (IHA), abdominal ultrasonography, intravenous urography and computed tomography (CT). All patients underwent surgery and were followed for an average of 5.6 years. Lumbar or abdominal pain was the most common symptom. Eosinophilia was seen in five patients (50%), IHA positivity occurred in four patients (40%) and the Casoni skin test was positive in four patients (40%). Abdominal CT was the most useful diagnostic method of radiological investigation (100%). No complications or recurrences were seen on follow-up. Urinary hydatid disease is uncommon and is likely to cause considerable diagnostic difficulties, and should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of space-occupying lesions of the urinary tract."
CD008686,0,12161863,0,[Multiple sclerosis with childhood onset].,"The clinical manifestations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests were analyzed in 19 patients with early-onset (before the age of 17 years) multiple sclerosis (MS) and in 100 patients with the definite diagnosis of MS with adult onset. Between group differences in sex ratio and initial neurological symptoms, with the prevalence of acute brainstem dysfunction (37%) and optic neuritis (37%) in the patients with early onset MS, were revealed. In childhood, the disease course was poorer with early disablement on the background of attendant unfavorable conditions. A sensitivity of various MRI parameters was analyzed and the essential proportion of the tumor-like acute inflammatory lesions was shown in early onset MS (29%). Immunological tests (albumin coefficient evaluation) revealed that in early onset MS hematoencephalic barrier dysfunction was registered more often, comparing to adult onset MS (100% vs 50%). The peculiarities of biases in concentrations of kappa-free and lambda-free light immunoglobulin chains in blood and CSF were detected. Higher levels of the kappa-free light chains concentrations in CSF were mostly found in the patients both with early and adult onset MS (86% and 99%, respectively) that confirmed the diagnostic value of this index. The results obtained may improve MS diagnosis in children."
CD008686,0,12160973,0,Back and neck pain in children with cancer.,"Neck and back pain are frequent complaints of patients with pediatric cancer, second only to headaches as a cause of neurologic consultation. The importance of this symptom, however, has not been studied in the pediatric cancer patients. This report is a review of the consultations as a result of neck and back pain in patients with pediatric cancer, with analysis of clinical presentation, etiology, underlying cancer, and neuroradiologic findings. The etiology of the complaint varied with the underlying cancer, although metastatic disease to the spine was frequent in patients with solid tumors, in younger children, and in patients admitted to the hospital. Back or neck pain is a serious complaint in children with systemic cancer, because the incidence of metastatic disease is high. Magnetic resonance imaging of the whole spine should be obtained if metastatic disease can not be excluded clinically, particularly for young patients and in children with advanced disease."

CD008686,0,12144086,0,Nonsecretory multiple myeloma.,"Nonsecretory multiple myeloma (NSMM) is a rare variant of the classic form of multiple myeloma (MM) and accounts for 1% to 5% of all cases of MM. The clinical presentation and radiographic findings of NSMM and MM are the same. The diagnosis of MM requires the detection of a monoclonal gammopathy in the serum or urine. In NSMM, however, no such gammopathy can be demonstrated, making the diagnosis more difficult. We describe a 43-year-old African American woman who initially had back pain and pathologic vertebral compression fractures that were thought to be due to osteoporosis. Five months later, hypercalcemia developed and NSMM was diagnosed. No monoclonal gammopathy was found in the serum or urine, but skeletal survey showed diffuse osteolytic lesions, and bone marrow biopsy revealed marked plasmacytosis. The immunohistochemical techniques and chromosomal analysis methods that are currently available are discussed."
CD008686,0,12140093,0,Spinal intradural hemorrhage due to a neurinoma in an early puerperal woman.,"A spinal intradural hemorrhage due to a neurinoma is very rare and requires emergency surgery. We report the first case of a spinal intradural hemorrhage due to a neurinoma in an early puerperal woman. The patient had a history of intermittent episodes of lower back pain for 3 years. The antenatal course to that time had been uneventful. Two days after a normal vaginal delivery, she presented with sudden onset of spinal lesion with severe symptoms and an emergency laminectomy was performed to remove an intradural hemorrhagic lesion due to a neurinoma. In this case, we speculate that clots in the intratumoral vessels spontaneously occurred during pregnancy and obstructions of these vessels followed by necrosis and hemorrhage of distal tissues occurred in the early postpartum stage. Moreover, the change in posture caused by the change in the maternal center of gravity following delivery, as well as the frequent bending required for the care of the newborn, may have been contributing factors. Mild but repetitive traction force caused by the change in posture and frequent bending may have created exertion on the vascular attachment to the nerve roots, causing the intradural hemorrhage."
CD008686,0,12138992,0,Uncommon clinical course of multiple osteochondromatosis in a patient with a long-term history of Cushing's disease.,"Cushing's disease (CD), the chronic endogenous hypercortisolism derived from an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma, and multiple osteochondromatosis (MO), a congenital mesoderm dyschondroplasia, represent two distinct rare neoplastic diseases. Clinical appearance of MO usually occurs during the first-second decade of life. In fact, the growth of osteochondromas parallels the patient's growth, then becoming quiescent after the closure of the epiphyses and the achievement of final stature. Here we describe an uncommon case of a patient with a long-term history of childhood-onset CD, who surprisingly developed MO during the third decade of life, after the remission of CD. Indeed, a female patient had been followed for CD from the age of 12 to the age of 24 years, when CD definitively remitted. At the age of 26 the patient complained progressively worsening backache and pain at level of hips and feet. Standard radiography of skeleton showed multiple bone dysmorphisms at level of the four limbs, spine and pelvis consistent with multiple osteochondromas and exostoses. A diagnosis of MO was performed. Total body bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-MDP revealed an increased uptake of the radioligand, suggesting an increased metabolic turnover in correspondence of the majority of the osteochondromas. However, the negativity of the majority of the lesions at 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy and the histological diagnosis of benign osteochondroma of the only positive lesion at 99mTc-DMSA evidenced that the high metabolic activity of the osteochondromas was not due to malignant transformation. However, the activity of the lesions was highly surprising considering that they usually become quiescent after the achievement of the final stature. In last analysis, the uncommon characteristics of MO and, particularly, its occurrence after stable remission of hypercortisolism, suggests a possible role of glucocorticoids in influencing the clinical course of the skeletal disease. The inhibitory effect of hypercortisolism on bone growth and maturation could explain the block in the proliferation of skeletal lesions during the developmental age, where CD was in the active phase, and the opposite effect of stimulation of the ostochondromas growth during stable normalization of cortisol secretion, after CD remission."

Haemangioblastomas occurring outside the central nervous system are uncommon. Wherever it is, recognising this tumour prior to surgery is desirable, as preoperative embolisation may be considered. We report the clinical, imaging and pathological features of a sporadic sacral root haemangioblastoma in a 58-year-old man with chronic sciatica and myelopathy. The diagnosis was questioned preoperatively because an enlarged sacral foramen, seen to be filled by a highly vascular, enhancing mass and dilated vessels. Myelopathy was attributed to the presumed high venous pressure resulting from increased flow in veins draining the vascular tumour.

What was previously believed to be a generally severe or even fatal accident, being the diagnosis made either at surgery or autopsy, or in patients with such consequent conditions as chemical meningitis or obstructive hydrocephalus, now appears to be more frequent than previously thought, and there is some evidence that it may also cause only a slight symptomatology or even be quite asymptomatic. We reviewed the clinical and imaging data of our series of five patients with spontaneously ruptured dermoids, spinal in one case, and intracranial supratentorial in four. These had their diagnosis following mild symptoms (number two cases) or incidentally (number two cases); the spinal tumor caused acute bladder dysfunction, possibly while undergoing rupture, and was associated with indolent intracranial fat spread. Three of the patients also had MR demonstration of asymptomatic persistence of fat spread in the subarachnoid spaces, respectively, 3, 4, and 5 years after rupture. One of the five cases, concerning a parasellar dermoid followed up over 6 years, provides the first demonstration of MR signal intensity change of the tumor prior to rupture."

From November 2000 the patient developed progressive pain, due to additional spine metastases, leading to pain therapy (according to the patient record) as follows: MST 320 mg oral 4 times daily, Durogesic 100 micrograms/h transdermal, Sevredol 40 mg oral 3 times daily and Ibuprofen 800 mg oral 3 times daily. Due to the risk of spinal instability and persisting pain a thoracic spondylodesis from Th 4-L2 was performed. Parallel to arrival in the PACU the patient developed extremely intensive pain. Pain control was achieved by fractional injection of overall 660 mg morphine in the first 120 min. After interviewing the patient, opioid consumption surprisingly turned out to be 60% higher than presumed.

The patient was referred to the orthopedic department for operation. Histologic examination revealed osteoblastoma of the L5 vertebra. Following surgery, the patient's pain resolved completely. Although osteoblastoma is extremely rare in the spine, it should be included in the differential diagnosis as a cause of chronic back pain, especially in young males with painful scoliosis and/or radicular-type leg pain. The tumor is often not readily apparent on plain radiographs. Therefore, advanced radiological investigation is necessary to establish the correct diagnosis."

CD008686,0,11999951,0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty in the treatment of malignant spine disease.,"Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive, radiologically-guided interventional procedure originally developed in France for the treatment of painful vertebral hemangiomas. The technique consists of the percutaneous puncture of the affected vertebral body, followed by injection of an acrylic polymer to provide bone augmentation and prevent further collapse. The internal ""casting"" of the trabecular microfractures results in pain relief and vertebral consolidation. Vertebroplasty was quickly adopted for use in metastatic vertebral lesions and hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma. The major experience with malignant disease has remained primarily in the European realm; in the United States vertebroplasty is used mainly for the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures. The reasons underlying this divergence in practice experiences remains unclear, although the explosion of vertebroplasty in the U.S. appears to be driven by an assertive, motivated and well-informed elderly population. In addition, malignant lesions are often challenging and practitioners may shy away from these clinically and technically more difficult patients. The purpose of this article is to introduce the principles of percutaneous vertebroplasty to the North American oncologic community with the hope that it mayfind a greater role in the treatmentof malignant disease affecting the spine."

CD008686,0,11976011,0,Imaging in chronic spinal cord injury--indications and benefits.,"As most patients who have suffered spinal cord injury can now expect a normal life span, the late complications of these injuries are seen increasingly frequently. Regular surveillance of both the renal tract and the central nervous system (CNS) is important as the treatment of impending, potentially fatal complications can be implemented before damage has progressed too far. Renal tract complications are particularly dangerous as they are often clinically silent but regular surveillance to detect early deterioration in renal function, particularly from reversible causes such as reflux or obstruction can pre-empt problems. Follow-up protocols depend on the bladder management regime but most centres advocate regular ultrasound with less frequent isotope function studies. With the increasing ability to diagnose and treat the neurological complications, surveillance of the state of the spinal cord with MRI is also important and many centres now advocate checks every few years with sagittal midline T2W sections are sufficient unless changes are noted, when axial T1W sections can be added without significant examination time penalty. Imaging is critical in acute problems. In addition to suffering from the usual normal conditions, patients with spinal cord injury suffer others peculiar to, or particularly related to, the injury, which may be missed as their symptomatology is greatly altered by their paraplegic or quadriplegic status and they may often present as generally unwell but with no obvious cause. This review discusses the role of radiology in routine surveillance of the CNS and the renal tract as well as in assessing specific conditions such as deteriorating neurology or renal function, pain, spinal instability, pressure sores, ectopic ossification, muscular spasm, spinal instability, airway problems and elective operations on the renal tract."
CD008686,0,11963236,0,[The limping child. Differential radiologic diagnosis of acute gait disorder in childhood and adolescence].,"Limping is a common and often challenging problem in children and adolescents. A limp is defined as asymetric deviation from a normal gait pattern. A systematic approach is necessary to determine the cause of the limp, so the radiologist should combine a thorough history, clinical information and pertinent radiologic testing. The possible differential diagnosis is extensive and includes many pathologies of the lower extremity and spine like trauma, infection, neoplasia, furthermore inflammatory, developmental and congenital disorders. In cases with knee or tight pain, an underlying hip condition should be considered. The childs age can narrow the possible differential diagnoses, because certain entities are age-related. Despite this wide bandwidth of entities, potential catastrophic causes like septic arthritis and malignant disease should be excluded first. Plain radiographs are often diagnostic. The choice of further imaging modalities like ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and bone scan should be guided by the history and clinical findings."

These diseases are characterised by a number of pain-induced vicious circles, and satisfactory control of pain acts to disrupt these self-perpetuating processes. Consequently, early mobilisation can be achieved in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, low back pain and sciatica, for example. In other cases analgesics may act simply to maintain the mobility of patients and in this way preserve their quality of life. When simple analgesics are not sufficient, the use of opioid-type analgesics is justified. Buprenorphine transdermal therapeutic system (TDS) is a novel formulation of a well-tolerated and highly effective drug for satisfactory pain control that can also be used in patients with chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) due to musculoskeletal diseases.

The patient consulted our hospital complaining of pain in the right side of her neck and upper right arm in August 1994. A leiomyosarcoma, originating around the right side of the neck and base of the skull was diagnosed. Initially, surgery was planned, but invasion into the spinal canal was discovered. Curative resection of the leiomyosarcoma around the right side of the base of the skull was not possible. Therefore, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy and hyperthermia was employed. After the treatment, the tumor decreased in size to 45% of its initial volume, and, simultaneously, her symptoms completely disappeared. The patient initially remained clinically free of the disease, but showed reaggravations at the primary tumor site 3 years and 3 months, and 4 years and 11 months, after the first treatment. The reaggravations were treated with EBRT combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy. As a result, she survived for 5 years and 7 months after the first treatment."

He presented with debilitating back pain and had radiographic evidence of T6-7 disk space destruction with involvement of adjacent vertebrae. Tissue culture from the disk space confirmed the diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis due to hematogenous spread of M. bovis. Treatment with antituberculous medications was begun soon after tissue diagnosis was made, and the patient fared well with medical therapy alone. Although uncommon, this infectious complication of BCG therapy should always be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Timely diagnosis is important, because chemotherapy, when initiated early in the disease, can preclude the necessity for surgical intervention."
CD008686,0,11934518,0,Acute transverse myelitis after Japanese B encephalitis vaccination in a 4-year-old girl.,"Fourteen days after Japanese B encephalitis (JBE) vaccination, a 4-year-old girl developed the full clinical manifestation of ATM within 24h. She showed acute ascending flaccid paraplegia with sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction and meningeal sign. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed neutrophil pleocytosis and elevated protein level. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse swelling of the cervical and lumbar cord with low signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging. These findings suggested that she had developed meningo-radiculomyelopathy. Since sequential MRI studies showed prompt reduction of the cord swelling, the high-dose methylprednisolone therapy employed seemed to have been effective for improvement of inflammation. Even with such potent drug treatment, she still has substantial flaccid diplegia and sphincter disorder 1 year later, and so we are convinced that the pathological change of the cord was as severe as in necrotizing myelopathy. Although the pathological process remains unknown, cellular autoimmune mechanism against the JBE vaccination is suspected."
CD008686,0,11931066,0,Proinflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid and serum in patients with disc herniation and sciatica.,"Proinflammatory cytokines have been identified in herniated intervertebral discs in humans, and such cytokines have experimentally been demonstrated to be important in the pathophysiological mechanisms of disc herniation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta IL-6, IL-8, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were investigated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique in 39 patients with lumbar disc herniation and sciatica. Pain duration and pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) were recorded at inclusion, and a clinical examination was performed evaluating neurological findings. The extent of disc herniation (protrusion or extrusion/sequestration) was evaluated perioperatively. Normal concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were present in CSF and serum in almost all patients with lumbar disc herniation. The concentrations of IL-8 in CSF were increased in 12 out of 39 patients, and these increased levels of IL-8 correlated to a short duration of pain and to more pronounced herniation (extrusion or sequestration). No relationship between IL-8 concentrations in CSF and pain intensity, positive neurological findings or a positive straight leg-raising (SLR) test was found. The observation of increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF in patients with a short duration of symptoms supports the concept of the initial involvement of inflammatory mechanisms after a disc herniation. The finding that most of the patients with increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF had an extrusion or a sequestration may suggest that the increase in IL-8 is related to mechanical nerve root compression, but may also indicate a biochemical effect exerted by the herniated disc on the surrounding tissue. Further studies on the potential role of IL-8 as a biomarker for disc herniation are warranted."

It is characterised by development of periaortic fibrous mass leading to progressive obstruction of vessels around the abdominal aorta and ureters. In the one third of cases we can find the causes of disease. There are ergotamine abuse, radiation, retroperitoneal surgery or hemorrhage, urine extravasation and response to different cancers. The other cases are idiopathic disease. We report a case of prostate cancer with unique course. The first manifestations of disease were diffuse peritoneal fibrosis and ureteral obstruction leading to bilateral hydronephrosis. Clinical course and histopathology showed idiopathic Ormond's fibrosis. Patient received oral immunosuppressive treatment (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day + azathioprine 1 mg/kg/day), followed by intravenous methylprednisolone puls (2 g). Treatment also consisted of DJ-stent placement on the left side. On the right side we were unable to overcome the obstruction of ureter. Because of persistent renal failure, thrombocytopenia, DIC and progressive lower back pain we did control MR and CT scan. The CT scans showed multiple osteolytic bone metastases in vertebral column (the sizes of them were between a few millimetres and 1.5 centimetre). Patient died due to renal failure and haemorrhagic diathesis in the course of disseminated cancer of unknown origin. The postmortem examination revealed diffuse peritoneal infiltration surrounding the ureters, intramural ventricular metastases, pulmonary metastases and vertebral metastases. The prostate was only slightly enlarged. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations of prostate showed primary low-differentiated prostate carcinoma (CK/+/, PAP/+/, PSA/+/). Peritoneal, ventricular and bone infiltrations also were metastases from low-differentiated carcinoma of prostate origin (CK/+/, PAP/+/, PSA/-/)."
CD008686,0,11925872,0,[Nonsecretory primary plasma cell leukemia successfully treated with VAD and MP therapy].,"A 78-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of lumbago and appetite loss. Blood analysis revealed anemia, hypercalcemia and circulating plasma cells. Bone marrow aspiration showed an elevated ratio (43%) of plasma cells, which expressed CD38 in the absence of CD19 and CD56 expression. Spinal MR imaging revealed multiple compression fractures and suggested diffuse invasion of plasma cells into the spinal bodies. No M-protein was detectable in serum or urine by immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation, but cytoplasmic M-protein (IgG-kappa) was detected by enzyme antibody staining. On the basis of the history and data, nonsecretory primary plasma cell leukemia was diagnosed. First, the patient was given modified VAD therapy (vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisolone) and complete remission was obtained. Then MP therapy (melphalan and prednisolone) was instituted, and remission has since been maintained for 11 months. Like many other cases of primary plasma cell leukemia, this case suggests that CD56 may act as an adhesion molecule between neoplastic plasma cells and bone marrow stromal cells. Our experience with this exceedingly rare case suggests the superiority of combination chemotherapy as an induction therapy and the effectiveness of MP therapy as maintenance therapy for this disease."
CD008686,0,11922659,0,Positive effect of transplantation of hNT neurons (NTera 2/D1 cell-line) in a model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Transplantation of hNT Neurons derived from the human teratocarcinoma cell-line (NTera2/D1) has been shown to ameliorate motor dysfunction in a number of injury or disease models in which the deficits are fairly localized. However, these cells have not been used before in a model with more extensive neurodegeneration. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of hNT Neuron transplants on motor neuron function in a mouse model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) in which there is a substitution of Alanine for Glycine at position 93 of the human SOD1 gene (G93A). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal degenerative motor neuron disease affecting the spinal cord, brainstem, and cortex. This disease clinically manifests as progressive muscular weakness and atrophy, leading to paralysis and death within 3-5 years of diagnosis. The FALS represents 10-13% of all cases. A range of behavioral tests was used to examine spontaneous locomotor activity, coordination, and muscle strength of mice. Long-term (10-11 weeks) transplantation of hNT Neurons into the L(4)-L(5) segments of the ventral horn spinal cord of FALS(G93A) mice at 7 weeks of age (before onset of overt behavioral symptoms of disease) delayed the onset of motor dysfunction for at least 3 weeks. The average lifespan of the transplanted mice was 128 days compared to 106 days for media-injected group. The last mouse in the hNT Neuron transplanted group was euthanized at 135 days of age when it display partial paralysis of the hindlimbs. Immunohistochemical analysis of the implanted spinal cords demonstrated the survival of grafted hNT Neurons and showed many healthy-appearing motor neurons near the implant site. These results suggest that hNT Neuron transplantation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for ALS."

CD008686,0,11903173,0,Chordoma: review of clinicoradiological features and factors affecting survival.,"This study reviews the clinicoradiological features of cranial and sacrospinal chordomas and identifies factors affecting survival. Nineteen patients seen between January 1980 and December 2000 with histopathological diagnosis of chordomas were retrospectively reviewed with reference to clinical presentation, imaging features, treatment modalities and post-therapy status. Eight had tumours in the skull base while 11 patients had spinal and sacrococcygeal lesions. Surgical resection was performed in 16 patients whose subsequent natural history was used to identify clinical indicators that may influence survival. Completeness of resection, age, gender and postoperative irradiation were subjected to analysis using the Cox proportional hazard models. Kaplan-Meir survival curves illustrate the survival distributions. Diplopia and facial pain are prime clinical presentations in cranial lesions, while extremity weakness and a sacrogluteal mass are common complaints in the sacrospinal group. Lesional calcifications are present in 40% while an osteolytic soft tissue mass is detectable by CT in all cases. Heterogeneous signals and internal septations on T2-weighted MRI are predominant features. In sacrospinal tumours, complete excision with adjuvant radiotherapy achieves the best results with a disease-free survival of more than 5 years. The clinical and imaging findings in this study are in accordance with those of other series. Except for complete surgical excision followed by radiotherapy in the subset of patients with sacrospinal tumours, none of the other clinical indicators show a statistical significant influence on survival."

Four cases of metastatic neurofibrosarcoma to the spine have been reported before. The current case is unusual because of the presence of two distinct, metachronous spinal metastasis and lung metastasis. A 30-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis and a history of previous neurofibrosarcoma resection presented with back pain. Radiologic evaluation revealed a lytic lesion of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. A transthoracal corpectomy, reconstruction by Harms' cage and posterior instrumentation, and fusion were carried out. After the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, a solitary pulmonary nodule was detected. Shortly after resection of the metastatic pulmonary nodule, the patient complained of acute onset low-back pain. Radiologic assessment revealed another lytic lesion in the L5 vertebra after 6 months. Again, a corpectomy, anterior and posterior instrumentation, and fusion were carried out. Eight months after the second spinal resection, another solitary pulmonary metastasis was diagnosed and resected. The patient's health status suddenly deteriorated 26 months after the initial spinal metastatectomy, and she died. Though local control can be achieved in more than 80% of the patients with neurofibrosarcoma by wide surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy, most patients die of systemic metastasis. The current patient survived 50 months after the initial resection of a forearm neurofibrosarcoma. Despite achieving local control, she died due to systemic recurrence. Prolonged survival with the help of chemo- and radiotherapy justifies our aggressive surgical strategy for the treatment of spinal metastasis in order to achieve neurologic cure and spinal stability."

Postmarketing data of the use of sildenafil in clinical practice confirm the efficacy and safety found in clinical trials and high satisfaction with treatment. Public awareness of the common occurrence of ED and the high likelihood of a potentially favorable response to an oral treatment increased dramatically with the introduction of sildenafil.

Technical note.,"Screw fixation augmented with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or some other biocompatible bone cement has been used in patients with osteoporosis requiring spinal fusion. No clinical studies have been conducted on PMMA-augmented screw fixation for stabilization of the vertebral column in patients with metastatic spinal tumors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether screw fixation augmented with PMMA might be suitable in patients treated for multilevel metastatic spinal tumors. Ten patients with metastatic spinal tumors involving multiple vertebral levels underwent stabilization procedures in which PMMA was used to augment screw fixation after decompression of the spinal cord. Within 15 days, partial or complete relief from pain was obtained in all patients postoperatively. Two of four patients in whom neurological deficits caused them to be nonambulatory before surgery were able to ambulate postoperatively. Neither collapse of the injected vertebral bodies nor failure of the screw fixation was observed during the mean follow-up period of 6.7 months. Screw fixation augmented with PMMA may offer stronger stabilization and facilitate the instrumentation across short segments in the treatment of multilevel metastatic spinal tumors."

CD008686,0,11793930,0,[Juxta-facet cysts: magnetic resonance tomography diagnosis].,"The term juxta-facet cyst summarizes synovial cysts, arising from degenerated facet joints and ganglion cysts, developing from mucinous degeneration of periarticular connective tissue. Most juxta-facet cysts are observed at the L4/5 level, which generally has the most motion within the lumbar spine. In this retrospective study 31 juxta-facet cysts in 28 patients were detected within 2898 lumbar MRI studies over a 2-year period (frequency 1%). 24 patients complained of back and lower extremity pain, the other 4 patients had unilateral back pain. In 7 cases radicular symptoms were observed, in 6 patients a neurogenic claudication. In 78% of the patients juxta-facet cysts were responsible for clinical symptoms. MRI is the diagnostic imaging technique of choice due to a high sensitivity. The juxta-facet cysts were located extradural, laterally to the thecal sack and adjacent to a degenerated facet joint. In all but one cases the cysts showed a signal intensity equivalent to cerebrospinal fluid. T2-weighted pulse sequences in sagittal orientation were very useful in delineating the hypointense cyst wall. In 1 patient with acute radicular pain MRI demonstrated a subacute hemorrhage within a juxta-facet cyst. Calcifications and gas-filled cysts can be missed with MRI, but will be demonstrated by computed tomography. 45% of the juxta-facet cysts showed an enhancement of the cyst wall after injection of Gd-DTPA. Spontaneous reduction or resolution of the cyst may occur during rest. Injection of corticosteroids into the corresponding facet joint may reduce the inflammatory process and resolve the symptoms in up to 70%. Surgical resection of the cyst is indicated in case of intractable pain and significant neurologic deficit and generally produces good relief from radicular symptoms."

CD008686,0,11793151,0,"[Treatment of low back pain--significance, principles and danger].","Today, a wide range of efficient analgesic and non-analgesic drugs for the treatment of back pain are available. However, drugs should never be the only mainstay of a back pain treatment program. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) are widely used in acute back pain. NSAIDs prescribed at regular intervals are effective to reduce simple back pain. The different NSAIDs are effective for the reduction of this pain. They have serious adverse effects, particularly at high doses, in the elderly, and on long-term administration. The new cyclooxygenase II-inhibitors have less gastrointestinal complications. But the long-term experiences are limited up to now. Considerable controversy exists about the use of opioid analgesics in chronic noncancer pain. Many physicians are concerned about the effectiveness and adverse effects of opioids. Other clinicians argue that there is a role for opioid therapy in chronic noncancer pain, e. g. especially in chronic low back pain. There is a low incidence of organ toxicity in patients who respond to opioids. The incidence of abuse and addiction is likewise relatively low. The potential for increased function and improved quality of life seems to outweigh the risks. However, there is a lack of randomised controlled trials (RCT) on opioid therapy in a multimodal pain treatment approach. Clinical experience and some studies suggest administration of sustained release opioids because of better comfort for the patient and less risks for addiction. The opioids should be selected due to the specific side effects of the different drugs. For patients with pre-existing constipation transdermal fentanyl should be preferred. Antidepressant medications have been used for the treatment of chronic back pain, though there is only little scientific evidence for their effectiveness. There is no evidence for the use of antidepressants in acute low back pain. Trials of muscle relaxants for patients with acute back pain have used a wide range of agents, e. g. benzodiazepines. They mostly reduce acute back pain, but they have significant adverse effects including drowsiness and psychological and physical dependence even after relatively short treatment. Benzodiazepines are not indicated in the treatment of chronic back pain. Drugs are sometimes necessary for the patients to begin and persevere a multimodal treatment program. Drug therapy should be terminated as soon as other treatment strategies succeed. Unfortunately, no studies exist evaluating the place of analgesics within a multimodal treatment program."

CD008686,0,11789008,0,[Magnetic resonance in examination of the spine in patients with multiple myeloma].,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disease of the haematopoietic system characterized by the formation of osteolytic foci of the skeleton with predilection of the thoracolumbar portion of the spine. The submitted investigation evaluates the importance of examination of the spine by magnetic resonance (MR), as compared with results of conventional radiology (CR). The analyzed group of 75 patients with multiple myeloma was assembled in the course of the previous four years. All patients were examined by conventional radiology and magnetic resonance and the assembled results were mutually compared. On examination by MR a pathological finding was recorded in 68/75 (91%) patients, when using CR in 41/75 (55%) patients. Compression of the vertebral bodies was assessed by means of magnetic resonance in 42/75 (56%) patients, when using CR in 37/75 (49%) patients. Secondary stenosis of the spinal canal was detected by MR in 23/75 (30%), extramedullary spread of myelomatous masses was found in 15/75 (20%) patients whereby radiographic examination was negative in these patients. Osteolytic foci in the area of the spine were recorded in 62/75 (83%) patients examined by MR, while by using CR only in 3/75 (4%). From the presented results ensues that nuclear magnetic resonance is for evaluation of spinal lesions in MM much more sensitive than conventional radiography, mainly due to the possibility of direct visualization of soft tissue tumourous masses and evaluation of their relationship to the spinal canal. The contribution of MR examination is invaluable in particular in patients with obscure back pain and a negative finding on radiographic examination of the skeleton where X-ray examination does not explain adequately the patient's complaints, as well as in patients with suspected compression of the spinal cord. In some liminal situations it contributes to more accurate assessment of the clinical stage and thus to selection of adequate treatment."
CD008686,0,11788635,0,GH-deficient survivors of childhood cancer: GH replacement during adult life.,"Childhood survivors of cancer are prone to a number of adverse sequelae related to the therapeutic interventions undertaken to achieve remission. The endocrine system is frequently affected; hypothalamo-pituitary dysfunction, in particular GH deficiency, is common after cranial irradiation. It is unclear to what extent GH deficiency contributes to the abnormalities observed in adult survivors of childhood cancer, and whether GH replacement reverses these anomalies. We compared 27 GH-deficient survivors of childhood cancer with 27 adult age- and sex-matched controls and went on to replace GH in the patient group to determine whether GH resulted in improvements of the baseline abnormalities. The GH-deficient survivors of childhood cancer had an adverse lipid profile (total cholesterol, 5.4 vs. 4.6 mM, P = 0.004; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 1.05 vs. 1.6 mM, P < 0.001; and triglycerides, 1.3 vs. 1.0 mM, P < 0.001) and were osteopenic (lumbar spine z-score, -1.53 vs. -0.31 SD score, P < 0.001; femoral neck z-score, -1.23 vs. -0.27 SD score, P = 0.02); additionally, the female subgroup had an increased percentage body fat (43.6 vs. 32.8%, P = 0.016). In keeping with the selection criterion, quality of life in the patient cohort, relative to the healthy controls, was severely impaired [adult GH-deficiency assessment (AGHDA), 15.5 (range, 8-25) vs. 1 (range, 0-19), P < 0.0001; psychological general well-being schedule, 67.5 (range, 18-86) vs. 89.0 (range, 51-104), P < 0.0001]. After 12 months of GH replacement, small (but significant) improvements were observed in body composition in the male subgroup (waist-hip ratio, 0.871 vs. 0.863, P < 0.05); and in the female cohort, total cholesterol (6.0 vs. 5.2 mM, P = 0.01) and triglyceride (2.1 vs. 1.4 mM, P = 0.01) levels fell. Bone mineral density improved in only one of the four sites studied (ultradistal radius, -1.21 vs. -1.09, P = 0.048) after a median duration of GH therapy of 18 months. Quality of life improved dramatically by 3 months (AGHDA, 15.5 vs. 10.0, P < 0.001), and the improvement was maintained at 12 months (AGHDA, 15.5 vs. 9.0, P < 0.001). Importantly, there was no clinical suggestion of tumor recurrence during the 12 months of GH replacement. The minor improvements observed in body composition, the lipid profile, and bone mineral density in GH-deficient adult survivors of childhood cancer after 12-18 months of physiological GH replacement suggest that GH deficiency may not be the major etiological factor in their pathogenesis; the converse seems to be true for the quality of life status of these individuals. We propose that, as in patients with hypopituitarism caused by pituitary disease, the main indication for GH replacement in GH-deficient survivors of childhood cancer should be severe impairment of quality of life."

The goal of this study was to determine whether there is a difference in clinical outcome between patients with lipomyelomeningocles, intraspinal lipomas, and lipomas of the filum terminale. One hundred and fourteen patients with spinal dysraphism were seen at Duke University Medical Center between 1995-1999. All patients who had undergone previous operative intervention for these lesions were excluded. Twenty-two patients with intradural lipomas were identified. Of these, 14 (64%) had lipomyelomeningoceles and 8 (36%) had intraspinal lipomas. Twenty-five patients had filum terminale lipomas. Operative management consisted of lumbosacral laminectomies with microsurgical resection of the lipoma and division of the fatty filum. Average age at presentation in symptomatic patients with lipomas of the filum terminale was 17.7 years, and 23 years in the symptomatic intraspinal lipoma group. Patients with lipomyelomeningoceles ranged in age from 1 day to 18 years, with the majority being younger than 2 years. After an average follow-up of 8 months all patients showed improvement in motor strength following operative intervention. Greater improvements in sensory, bladder, and pain scores were associated with filum terminale lipomas. The least improvements in these categories were seen in the lipomyelomeningocele group. Motor strength is the most likely deficit to improve following operative intervention. Lipomyelomeningoceles, intraspinal lipomas, and filum termniale lipomas have different clinical outcomes following operative intervention."

CD008686,0,11758872,0,Neuropathic cancer pain: the role of adjuvant analgesics.,"Neuropathic pain may be defined as pain related to abnormal somatosensory processing in either the peripheral or central nervous system. This pathophysiologic label is typically applied when the painful symptom is associated with an overt injury to neural structures, is part of a recognized syndrome, or has a dysesthetic quality (usually burning, shooting, or electrical). Most neural injury does not lead to clinically important neuropathic pain, but sometimes even a small degree of tissue injury can precipitate severe pain. In the cancer population, neuropathic pain is often related to compression, direct neoplastic invasion of the peripheral nerves or spinal cord, or to a neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. To manage neuropathic pain in this population, nonopioid adjuvant drugs that are neuroactive or neuromodulatory are often needed to complement opioid therapy. The primary adjuvant analgesics are anticonvulsant and antidepressant medications, but a wide variety of other drugs are also used. To optimize analgesic therapy in patients with neuropathic pain, both opioid and adjuvant analgesics must be used effectively."

CD008686,0,11749016,0,Craniospinal giant cell tumors: clinicoradiological analysis in a series of 11 cases.,"Primary craniospinal giant cell tumors are rare (5-15% of all giant cell tumors), locally destructive bone lesions which are generally not associated with Paget's disease. Clinical behavior of the craniospinal giant cell tumor (GCT) is unpredictable but often very aggressive and therefore optimal management of the lesions remains controversial. Wide resection of the involved bone is required, preferably with a wide margin of normal tissue, which may be difficult to achieve in the craniospinal region. The authors analysed a series of 11 patients, which included five cases of cranial and six cases of spinal GCTs. Their ages ranged from 12 to 46 years with a male preponderance. In the five cranial cases, all the tumors involved the skull base, three involved the spheno - ethmoidal region and in two cases the petroclival region was involved. Common presenting symptoms were frontotemporal swelling, epistaxis, local pain and neurological deficits attributable to the neurovascular compression. Proptosis, visual loss, nasal mass and cranial nerve involvement were the common findings. In the six patients with spinal lesions (one cervical, four thoracic and one thoracolumbar), local pain, progressive sensory motor deficits and bladder involvement were common presentations. Neuroimaging studies were performed in various combinations for preoperative evaluation and surgical planning. In cranial cases, multidisciplinary approaches were used to perform a near total or a total excision. In the spinal GCTs, only a partial excision was possible. Postoperative radiotherapy was delivered in ten patients. Histopathological studies were diagnostic. All patients were followed up for periods ranging from one to 10 years, with a mean of 2 years and 3 months. No significant increase in the residual tumor or recurrences, as seen on periodic neuroimaging studies, were noted during their follow-up period."
CD008686,0,11748345,0,Recovery from severe glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in an adolescent boy.,"An 18-yr-old boy presented with extreme back pain as the result of multiple vertebral fractures. At age 16 he had developed a tumor of the mesencephalon. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was established surgically. One year later, he developed progressive neurologic deficits in his upper and lower limbs with an increase in the size of the tumor. He was treated by irradiation and high doses of glucocorticoids. Although the neurologic deficits progressively improved, he developed severe back pain resulting in complete immobilization for 3 mo in spite of neurologic recovery. Multiple vertebral fractures were diagnosed by X-ray. Bone density was extremely low (Z-score of -5.5 in the spine and -3.1 in the femoral neck). The patient was treated with calcium and vitamin D, calcitonin, bisphosphonates, physiotherapy, and progressive mobilization. Glucocorticoids were decreased and could be stopped as the neurologic deficits fully recovered. After 1 yr of treatment with intermittent i.v. pamidronate, bone density had increased by 40% in the spine and by 25% in the femoral neck despite growth arrest. He progressively recovered from back pain and is now, at age 20, fully ambulant, studying mechanical engineering, without neurologic sequelaes and free of glucocorticoids. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the tumor had disappeared. This case proves that treatment of symptomatic glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis during puberty can be rewarding, even when multiple and invalidating vertebral fractures already exist."

CD008686,0,11718191,0,Paget's disease of the spine and its management.,"A review of the literature was conducted to study the pathomechanics by which Paget's Disease of bone (PD) alters the spinal structures that result in distinct spinal pathologic entities such as pagetic spinal arthritis, spinal stenosis, and other pathologies, and to assess the best treatment options and available drugs. The spine is the second most commonly affected site with PD. About one-third of patients with spinal involvement exhibit symptoms of clinical stenosis. In only 12-24% of patients with PD of the spine is back pain attributed solely to PD, while in the majority of patients back pain is either arthritic in nature or a combination of a pagetic process and coexisting arthritis. Neural element dysfunction may be attributed to compressive myelopathy by pagetic bone overgrowth, pagetic intraspinal soft tissue overgrowth, ossification of epidural fat, platybasia, spontaneous bleeding, sarcomatous degeneration and vertebral fracture or subluxation. Neural dysfunction can also result from spinal ischemia, when blood is diverted by the so-called ""arterial steal syndrome"". Because the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment for pagetic spinal stenosis has been clearly demonstrated, surgical decompression should only be instituted after failure of antipagetic medical treatment. Surgery is indicated as a primary treatment when neural compression is secondary to pathologic fractures, dislocations, spontaneous epidural hematoma, syringomyelia, platybasia, or sarcomatous transformation. Since, in the majority of cases with pagetic spinal involvement, there are also coexisting osteoarthritic changes, antipagetic medical treatment alone may be disappointing. Therefore, one must be careful before attributing low back pain to PD alone. Five classes of drugs are available for the treatment of PD: bisphosphonates, calcitonins, mithramycin (plicamycin), gallium nitrate, and ipriflavone. Bisphosphonates are the most popular, and several forms have been investigated, but only the following forms have been approved for clinical use: disodium etidronate, clodronate, aledronate, risedronate, neridronate, pamidronate, tiludronate, ibadronate, aminohydroxylbutylidene bisphosphonate, olpadronate, and zoledronate.

The initial scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) failed to detect seizure activity in these patients, although the memory dysfunction along with the magnetic resonance imaging and FDG-PET findings suggested subcortical seizure activity. However, extended EEG monitoring revealed repetitive temporal lobe electrographic seizure activity. Follow-up MRIs in 2 patients and postmortem findings on 1 patient suggested that hippocampal sclerosis had developed following the clinical syndrome. Cerebrospinal fluid studies revealed the presence of human herpesvirus 6, variant B, DNA in all of 3 patients who had lumbar punctures. Immunohistochemical staining for the P41 and P101 human herpesvirus 6 protein antigens showed numerous immunoreactive astrocytes and neurons in the hippocampus of 1 of the patients who died from other causes.

These cysts are usually asymptomatic but may produce symptoms by compressing the spinal cord or nerve roots suddenly or progressively. We present three cases in the pediatric age group with spinal intradural arachnoid cysts without a preceding history of trauma. Three patients with symptomatic intradural arachnoid cysts were investigated with conventional T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI scans demonstrated the intradural arachnoid cysts with slightly lower CSF signal intensity on the gradient echo images and slightly higher signal intensity on T1-weighted images. The first cyst was located at the level T12-L1 and compressed the conus medullaris, with neurogenic bladder and cauda equina syndrome for 2 months. The second was located at the level C5-T1 ventrally, with spastic gait and neurogenic bladder for 4 years. The other was located at T2-3 ventrally, with sudden onset of quadriplegia after jumping rope. The combined treatment of total resection and wide fenestration in our three patients produced an excellent return of neurologic function in each one, except for residual urinary disturbance in case 2. Intradural spinal arachnoid cysts appear to result from an alteration of the arachnoid trabeculae; some such cysts are ascribed anecdotally to previous trauma or arachnoiditis, whereas the majority are idiopathic and congenital. The majority of intradural spinal arachnoid cysts occur in the thoracic region and most are dorsal to the neural elements. Only 10 cases have been reported in which the intradural arachnoid cysts were located anterior to the cervical spinal cord, of which 8 were in the pediatric age group, like our case 2. Myelography, postcontrast CT myelography and MRI have been demonstrated as useful for the diagnosis of intradural arachnoid cysts. MRI is the imaging modality of choice, and the extent, size and nature of the lesion in our cases were well demonstrated by MRI. Surgical treatment is necessary if progressive neurological dysfunction appears in the course of spinal cord compression. Complete surgical excision of the cysts is the best choice of treatment, and wide fenestration and shunting of the cyst to the peritoneum, pleural cavity or right atrium were the modalities of choice. MRI offers a noninvasive and effective means to make the diagnosis of arachnoid cysts easier. Intradural arachnoid cysts may cause progressive myelopathy; however, the postoperative prognosis is good if the operation is performed prior to neurologic deficits."

There were recurrences of the intracranial meningioma in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998. These recurrences were accompanied by differentiation to atypical and anaplastic meningioma. In all of these operations, a macroscopically complete resection of the tumour was performed. In 1996 adjuvant radiation therapy was given. In 1998 therapy with bromocriptine was adopted. In April 1999, the patient presented with lumbosacral pain associated with L5 bilateral sciatica. MRI showed a gadolinium enhancing mass lesion at L5-S1 level. Complete tumour resection was performed. The histological findings were the same as in 1998. In December 1999 the patient presented with perineal pain and MRI showed a L4 and S3 recurrence and the tumour was resected. The histological findings were those of a malignant meningioma.

Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis/sensory neuronopathy syndrome with concurrent autonomic neuropathy has been reported to occur in paraneoplastic syndromes, although its occurrence concomitant with acute pandysautonomia is less frequent. The authors describe the clinical, neuropathologic, and serologic features of two cases with an anti-Hu-related paraneoplastic syndrome presenting with progressive autonomic neuropathy. Both patients showed features of dysautonomia, including postural dizziness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, and symptoms of sensory neuropathy. Investigations disclosed severe sensory and autonomic neuropathy and positive HuAb titers. The disease of patient 1 had a very rapid progression, and the patient died of cardiac arrest within 2 months of the onset of symptoms. The autopsy revealed SCLC. In contrast, the disease of patient 2 had a less aggressive course. An extensive tumor search disclosed SCLC only 28 months after onset of symptoms, and the patient died 1 month later of cardiorespiratory arrest. Autopsies in both cases showed inflammation involving the intermediolateral columns and the dorsal root ganglia.

However, one must be cautious not to overinterpret small abnormalities that are also frequent in asymptomatic subjects. There is conflicting evidence about the correlation of high-intensity zones with clinical symptoms. Bulging disks and protrusions are a common finding in asymptomatic individuals, whilst extrusions are almost always accompanied by back pain and sciatica. In patients with back pain or sciatica, MRI is indicated after failure of conservative management or neurological deterioration. Contrast-enhanced MRI is well suited to differentiate a recurrent disk extrusion from epidural fibrosis. In all cases suspicious of tumor or infection, MRI is indicated as a first-line investigation. The indications and pitfalls of the state of the art of MRI are delineated in this article."
CD008686,0,11545760,0,Design and methods of the Raloxifene Use for The Heart (RUTH) study.,"Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that lowers total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, reduces the risk of vertebral fracture, and is associated with a reduced incidence of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The Raloxifene Use for The Heart (RUTH) trial is designed to determine whether raloxifene 60 mg/day compared with placebo: (1) lowers the risk of the coronary events (coronary death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], or hospitalized acute coronary syndromes other than MI); and (2) reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer in women at risk for a major coronary event. RUTH is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of 10,101 postmenopausal women aged > or =55 years from 26 countries. Women are eligible for randomization if they are postmenopausal and have documented coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral arterial disease, or multiple risk factors for CHD. Use of estrogen within the previous 6 months is an exclusion factor. The study will be terminated after a minimum of 1,670 participants experience a primary coronary end point. Secondary end points include cardiovascular death, myocardial revascularization, noncoronary arterial revascularization, stroke, all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, all breast cancers, clinical fractures, and venous thromboembolic events, in addition to the individual components of the composite primary coronary end point. RUTH will provide important information about the risk-benefit ratio of raloxifene in preventing acute coronary events and invasive breast cancer, as well as information about the natural history of CHD in women at risk of major coronary events."
CD008686,0,11544572,0,Analysis of skeletal-related events in breast cancer and response to therapy.,"The skeleton is a common site for the spread of metastatic cancer and skeletal complications are a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment of skeletal morbidity is therefore an essential component of therapy for cancer patients with bone metastases. Bisphosphonates are currently the treatment of choice for skeletal complications. In a patient diagnosed with bone metastases, skeletal morbidity is evaluated by a number of endpoints known as skeletal related events. These include bone pain, requirement for radiation or surgery to bone, pathologic and radiologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and progression of bone metastases. The efficacy of bisphosphonate treatment is evaluated by their effect on the number and frequency of skeletal-related events. In addition, surrogate markers of bone resorption such as collagen telopeptides or quality of life measurements can be used to monitor therapy, though these do not necessarily reflect skeletal morbidity. Intravenous pamidronate is currently the standard treatment for patients with bone metastases, and is effective in reducing the frequency of a variety of skeletal-related events. The more potent bisphosphonates ibandronate and zoledronate are now being evaluated in this setting. These agents may offer advantages over pamidronate in terms of convenience of administration. Clinical trials underway will determine whether they are equivalent or even superior to pamidronate in reducing skeletal-related events."
CD008686,0,11535969,0,[Use of clodronic acid in mineral metabolism conditions: state of the art in 2000].,"Clodronic acid is a non-aminate bisphosphonate capable of inhibiting bone resorption. Pharmacological and clinical trials have shown the efficacy of clodronic acid in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and in all conditions of excess bone resorption, such as Paget's disease, malignant tumoral hypercalcemia and osteolytic metastases. Clodronic acid is the only bisphosphonate currently on the market available for both oral and parenteral administration. Intramuscular therapy with clodronic acid at a dose of 100 mg/week has shown significant effects on bone mineral density after 6 months treatment in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis and these effects were maintained 3 years after the start of treatment. Increased bone mass is associated with a reduced risk of the onset of vertebral fractures. In a recent three-year study a significant increase was observed in bone mineral density associated with a 46% reduction in the incidence of vertebral fractures. The reduction in bone pain after parenteral treatment with clodronic acid is an important added value in the use of this molecule in osteopenic pathologies. Moreover the costs of parenteral clodronic acid treatment is certainly competitive compared to other drugs. Oral and parenteral clodronic acid was well tolerated in clinical trials. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were described only with high oral doses. These effects were transient and generally resolved without interrupting the treatment. Clodronic acid is an effective and well tolerated drug able to inhibit bone resorption. The low incidence of undesired effects at a gastroenteric level, the possibility of formulas for parenteral administration, the antalgic effect and low costs make clodronic acid an extremely interesting molecule for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and all conditions of excessive bone resorption, such as Paget's disease, malignant tumoral hypercalcemia, osteolytic metastasis and hyperparathyroidism."
CD008686,0,11535963,0,Vertebral fractures: a hidden problem of osteoporosis.,"Osteoporosis is a progressive skeletal disease, which in many cases remains silent and asymptomatic until a fracture occurs. Vertebral fractures are the earliest and most common osteoporotic fractures. The prevalence of vertebral fractures increases steadily with age, ranging between 20% for 50-year-old postmenopausal women to 64.5% for older women. The majority of vertebral fractures are not connected with severe trauma, and only one in three is diagnosed clinically. Usually vertebral fractures are associated with such clinical symptoms as back pain, posture change, loss of height, functional impairment, disability, and diminished quality of live. Women with the most severe vertebral fractures are the most likely to incur further fractures, with as much as 3.4 times the risk of hip fracture, and 12.6 times the risk of new vertebral fractures. Almost 20% of women will experience another fracture within 1 year after a vertebral fracture. Vertebral fractures are accompanied by increased mortality. The relative risk of death following vertebral fracture is almost 9 times higher. The most important purpose of osteoporosis management in postmenopausal women is prevention of the first vertebral fracture. Raloxifene (Evista) is the only SERM approved by the American FDA for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. It is the first compound with selective estrogen agonist activity in bone and in the cardiovascular system, but with estrogen antagonist activity or no activity in reproductive tissues and breast. Raloxifene reduces the risk of positive estrogen receptor breast cancer, decreases total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, increases HDL cholesterol, does not increase the risk of endometrial cancer or cause bleeding and spotting. After 3 years of treatment Raloxifene reduces the risk of first vertebral fracture by 55%. The fracture risk within one year is reduced by as much as 68%. Continued observation has proved its sustained efficacy in the further reduction of fracture risk by 49% in the fourth year. Raloxifene treatment does not change the physiological structure of bone quality and does not cause fibrosis, osteomalacia or other toxic effects."

Its intradural location and fat component is the key for proper preoperative diagnosis, which could hardly be made by traditional imaging studies including plain film and myelography. Both CT and MRI can reveal the fat component of the tumor, but MRI is superior to CT in demonstrating its relationship with adjacent normal nerve tissue. We report a 32-year-old man who had back pain for years and the symptom progressed rapidly in recent two months. MRI revealed an intradural tumor at T12 level with high signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. The signal intensity dropped dramatically with fat saturation technique, which confirmed fat as its main component. The patient received surgery and the tumor was proved to be an intraspinal lipoma."

Five cases of primary epidural EES are described, which presented with non-specific symptoms leading to a long diagnostic delay. The median age at diagnosis was 22 years (range 13-36 years). The median diagnostic delay was 3 months. All patients had one or more neurological deficits. All underwent surgical exploration with a laminectomy and partial resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to a dose of 46-50 Gy and chemotherapy with VAC (vincristine, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide) alternating with ICE (ifosphamide, cisplatin and etoposide) for at least six cycles. The mean follow-up period is 21.2 months (range 11-32 months). Four of the five patients achieved a complete remission and are disease free at the time of writing this report. Two patients have a residual neurological deficit--both having presented with long history of neurological deficit. Primary spinal epidural EES should be suspected whenever young patients present with back pain and/or radicular pain, have abnormal neurology and an extradural mass is demonstrated on MRI. Surgical excision followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (50 Gy) and combination chemotherapy (VAC alternating with ICE) achieved local and systemic control in these patients. A greater number of patients and longer follow up are required to evolve a generally accepted treatment policy for this aggressive but potentially curable malignancy."
CD008686,0,11529262,0,Recognizing spinal cord emergencies.,"Physicians who work in primary care settings and emergency departments frequently evaluate patients with neck and back pain. Spinal cord emergencies are uncommon, but injury must be recognized early so that the diagnosis can be quickly confirmed and treatment can be instituted to possibly prevent permanent loss of function. The differential diagnosis includes spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral fracture or space-occupying lesion, spinal infection or abscess, vascular or hematologic damage, severe disc herniation and spinal stenosis. The most important information in the assessment of a possible spinal cord emergency comes from the history and the clinical evaluation. Physicians must look for ""red flags""--key historical and clinical clues that increase the likelihood of a serious underlying disorder. In considering diagnostic tests, physicians should apply the principles outlined in an algorithm for the evaluation of low back pain prepared by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research). Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can clearly define anatomy, but these studies are costly and have a high false-positive rate. Referral of high-risk patients to a neurologist or spine specialist may be indicated."

Twenty-two cases of septic discitis were identified, suggesting an annual incidence of 2/100 000/year. Seventy-three percent of patients were aged > or =65 years. In 91% of patients, back pain was the presenting symptom, with neurological signs evident in 45% of patients. Fever >37.5 degrees C was present in 68% of patients, and a marked elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 91%. Diagnosis was originally by MRI in 86% of patients, with plain radiographs not diagnostic of discitis in the early stages of the infection. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest pathogen (41%), but in 18% of patients, no organism was identified. The major predisposing factors to septic discitis were invasive procedures (41%), underlying cancer (25%) and diabetes (18%). Pre-existing degenerative spinal disease was found in 50% of patients. Four patients whose causative organism was not isolated had a poorer outcome: one death and three with increased morbidity. Our estimated incidence rate (2/100 000/year) is higher than that in previous studies and may be due to a higher detection rate with MRI and/or a genuine increase in the number of cases. Septic discitis should be considered in any patient who has severe localized pain at any spinal level, especially if accompanied by fever and elevated ESR, or in the immunosuppressed."

Her serum IgG level was elevated to 5,565 mg/dl at admission. Despite treatment with doxorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone, melphalan and interferon-alpha, the response was transient. Nine months later, multiple skin nodules appeared on her chest, abdominal wall and right thigh accompanied by elevation of the serum IgG level. Response to combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, ranimustine, vincristine and prednisolone was also transient. The skin tumors on the bilateral thighs, especially on the left side, acquired chemotherapy resistance and gradually enlarged. Although the serum IgG level was maintained by chemotherapy within the range 1, 790-2,676 mg/dl, the skin tumors on the left thigh had spread very rapidly and appeared ""rock-like"". The enlarged tumors caused necrosis with erosions and oozing hemorrhage. A skin biopsy from the tumors on the left thigh showed plasmacytoma in which infiltration of large anaplastic plasma cells was observed. The patient died of sepsis 8 months after the skin tumors initially developed.

While chest radiography revealed no abnormality, chest computed tomography showed the prominence of mediastinal soft tissue, extending to the left hilum and partially destroying the nearby vertebrae. However, no pleural effusion was noted. After admission, a thoracoscopic examination was performed, and a whitish mass was found on the pleural surface partially adhering to the chest wall. Histological examination of the biopsied material showed dense areas of collagenous tissue with small foci of slightly atypical spindle cells. These findings led to the diagnosis of desmoplastic malignant pleural mesothelioma. The patient was treated with combined chemo-radiotherapy, but the response to this treatment was unclear.

Fifteen patients were diagnosed as having a vertebral insufficiency fracture on the basis of: (a) radiographic oseteopenia of the vertebra; (b) positive bone scan images; and (c) no episode of newly identified malignant disease in a subsequent 1 year follow up. These patients were analysed with respect to age, gender, bone mineral density, the number and distribution of the affected vertebrae, the extent of vertebral deformity, and consistency between radiographic and bone scan findings. Vertebral insufficiency fractures exhibited: (a) strict female predominance; (b) concave deformity of the affected vertebra; (c) a wide range of the vertebral height ratios and fracture distribution; and (d) low consistency between the vertebral deformity assessed by the lateral radiograph and positive activity on bone scanning. These findings represent a unique clinical feature of vertebral insufficiency fracture, and also emphasize the difficulty of radiographic diagnosis, as well as the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach."

Hypercalcemia did not occur in the clodronate group but was observed in four placebo-treated patients. Clodronate-treated patients had a significant reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo (p = 0.01; measured using a visual pain scale) and significantly fewer patients receiving clodronate required analgesics (p = 0.02). The evaluation of global efficacy by physicians and patients indicated that clodronate was more efficacious than placebo (respectively p = 0.02 and p = 0.01). No significant difference in incidence of adverse effects was observed between the two groups. Clodronate therapy significantly delayed the occurrence of new bone events in these patients with bone metastases from breast cancer and adds to treatment of malignant osteolysis."

Limb pain is sometimes described and can be misleading. We describe two recent cases seen in our emergency department, where vertebral fractures, a much rarer finding, were the only presenting symptoms that led to the diagnosis. One case had been thoroughly evaluated only 5 weeks prior to the diagnosis and included magnetic resonance imaging. The second patient was rapidly referred to our center with a history of acute lumbar pain. Emergency physicians caring for children must be aware of this rare type of presentation of leukemia."
CD008686,0,11486738,0,Pathology quiz: small cell osteosarcoma.,"A 15-year-old black male presented with shortness of breath, leg weakness, and pain in his back and rib cage. Four years previously he had noticed a lump in his upper back and complained of pain when playing basketball, especially on contact to that area. Recently, the pain had become more constant and increased in intensity. This was associated with loss of control in his legs, weakness, and paraesthesia. General physical examination revealed a palpable mass in the right midline upper back. Laboratory results were within normal limits. Radiographic scans demonstrated a destructive soft tissue mass at T6 vertebral body with scattered stippled calcification (Figure 1). The patient underwent a biopsy followed by excision of the mass (Figure 2) and decompressive laminectomy with reconstruction."
CD008686,0,11485596,0,Inflammatory pseudotumour involving the skull base and cervical spine.,"Inflammatory pseudotumour (IPT) is an idiopathic condition characterized by sclerosing inflammation, which mimics a neoplastic process. IPT involving the skull base and cervical spine is distinctly rare and usually indistinguishable from aggressive neoplasms or infection. We report a case of IPT involving the skull base and cervical spine. Initially the patient complained of headache and hearing loss without other neurological dysfunction. Two cycles of oral systemic steroid therapy resulted in only partial responses. Low dose radiotherapy was followed by quadriparesis as the lesion infiltrated into the cervical vertebral bodies. Subsequently a second course of radiation was administered to the whole cervical spine. Marked improvement was observed clinically and radiologically; however, the patient gradually deteriorated and died of sepsis. Given the aggressive nature of disease and the complications related to the long-term treatment, we suggest that a more aggressive therapeutic approach is suitable in extensive IPT of the skull base."

On admission, the physical examination revealed symptoms of meningeal irritation, nuchal rigidity, severe headache, continuous nausea, and vomiting. Cerebral computed tomography of the intracranial subarachnoidal space revealed no subarachnoid hemorrhage. Her cerebrospinal fluid was bloody. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging identified a posterior mediastinal tumor adherent to the left side of the 5th thoracic vertebra and an abnormally expanded blood vessel near the mediastinal tumor. In addition, a high signal intensity lesion appeared to be present on the surface of the spinal cord. A mediastinal neoplasm was removed through standard thoracotomy. During surgery, marked enlargement was noted in some veins (hemiazygos and 5th intercostal veins) which apparently had been constricted by the mediastinal tumor. Surgical and radiological findings suggested a relationship between the constricted venous return due to the tumor and the patient's spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage."

Metastatic involvement of the bone is one of the most frequent causes of pain in cancer patients and represents one of the first signs of widespread neoplastic disease. The pain may originate directly from the bone, from nerve root compression or from muscle spasms in the area of the lesions. The mechanism of metastatic bone pain is mainly somatic (nociceptive) even though, in some cases, neuropathic and visceral stimulations may overlap. The conventional symptomatic treatment of metastatic bone pain requires the use of multidisciplinary therapies such as radiotherapy in association with systemic treatment (hormonotherapy, chemotherapy, radioisotopes) with the support of analgesic therapy. Recently, studies have indicated the use of bisphosphonates in the treatment of pain and in the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with metastatic bone disease. In some patients pharmacological treatment, radiotherapy, radioisotopes administered alone or in association are not able to manage pain adequately. The role of neuroinvasive techniques in treating metastatic bone pain is debated. The clinical conditions of the patient, his life expectancy and quality of life must guide the physician in the choice of the best possible therapy."

The rarity of the condition and its indolent clinical course has made the evaluation of treatment efficacy difficult. To clarify postoperative outcome and prognostic factors, we performed a retrospective analysis of intramedullary spinal cord astrocytomas in a single institute. Twenty-eight patients were surgically treated between 1978 and 1999; of median age 36 years (range, 19-68 years); nineteen patients were males and nine females. All patients presented with pain and neurological deficits. The cervical cord was involved in fifteen patients, cervico-thoracic in five, thoracic in six and thoraco-lumbar in two. Gross total removal was performed in three patients, subtotal removal in six, partial removal in fourteen and biopsy only in five. Nineteen patients received radiation therapy postoperatively. The mean follow-up period was 31.9 months (range, 0.5-184 months). Low-grade astrocytomas were found in 18 cases, anaplastic astrocytoma in three cases and glioblastomas in seven cases. The median survivals of patients with low- and high-grade astrocytoma were 184 months and 8 months, respectively (p < 0.05). The median survivals of irradiated and non-irradiated patients with low-grade astrocytoma were 184 months and 102 months. Neither the extent of resection, nor radiation influenced the survival rate. In summary, the histological grade was the most significant predictor of survival in patients with astrocytoma of the spinal cord."

In a 2-year period, the patient developed sexual dysfunctions, micturitional disturbances and severe orthostatic hypotension and was erroneously diagnosed as having primary autonomic failure. However, the examination of all the autonomic functions showed that papillary function and cardiovascular reflexes were normal. CT scan of the abdomen revealed the presence of several small masses in the adrenal glands and along the lumbar sympathetic chain. Cytologic examination of the adrenal glands showed clusters of ganglionlike cells interspersed with Schwann cells, leading to the diagnosis of ganglioneuromas. Patients with signs and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction need an extensive clinical and laboratory examination of all the autonomic functions in order to exclude secondary causes of the symptomatology."

A 30-year-old man had developed gait disturbance in his childhood, and harbored multiple tumors in spinal nerve roots, in the intradural extramedullary and intramedullary spinal cord. The spinal root tumor and intradural extramedullary tumor were histologically diagnosed as schwannoma and meningioma, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging showed two intramedullary cystic lesions, one in the cervical and the other in the thoracic spine. Because his sensorimotor dysfunction in the lower extremities continued to worsen gradually, three of the multiple nodular tumors in the thoracic cystic lesion were removed. All three tumors were composed of eosinophilic piloid cells with modest nuclear pleomorphism. No Rosenthal fibers were found. A concentration of slender eosinophilic cellular processes surrounding the vascular wall was seen. Periodic acid Schiff and Masson trichrome-positive balloons were seen in the extracellular space. Detection of ependymal rosettes, although only few in number, led the diagnosis as a tanycytic ependymoma. Recognition of this ependymoma variant should be emphasized to avoid confusion with pilocytic astrocytoma or intramedullary schwannoma."

CD008686,0,11417967,0,"Metastatic bone disease: clinical features, pathophysiology and treatment strategies.","Metastatic bone disease develops as a result of the many interactions between tumour cells and bone cells. This leads to disruption of normal bone metabolism, with the increased osteoclast activity seen in most, if not all, tumour types providing a rational target for treatment. The clinical course of metastatic bone disease in multiple myeloma, breast and prostate cancers is relatively long, with patients experiencing sequential skeletal complications over a period of several years. These include bone pain, fractures, hypercalcaemia and spinal cord compression, all of which may profoundly impair a patient's quality of life. External beam radiotherapy and systemic endocrine and cytotoxic treatments are the mainstay of treatment in advanced cancers. However, it is now clear that the bisphosphonates provide an additional treatment strategy, which reduces both the symptoms and complications of bone involvement. Ongoing research is aimed at trying to define the optimum route, dose, schedule and type of bisphosphonate in metastatic bone disease and in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in cancer patients. In vitro suggestions of direct anticancer activity and some promising clinical data in early breast cancer have resulted in considerable interest in the possible adjuvant use of bisphosphonates to inhibit the development of bone metastases."
CD008686,0,11416261,0,The significance of intrathecal opioid therapy for the treatment of neuropathic cancer pain conditions.,"The effectiveness of intrathecal opioid therapy when applied to different pain mechanisms, in particular neuropathic and nociceptive pain conditions, was studied retrospectively in 43 patients suffering from cancer pain. On the basis of clinical and radiological data, the pain mechanisms were categorized as nociceptive (n = 23) and neuropathic (n = 20). The average duration of treatment of nociceptive pain was 5 months, of neuropathic pain only 2.5 months. The initial median reduction of pain with intrathecal opioid therapy was 77.8% for nociceptive and 61.1% for neuropathic pain. Long-term results with patients suffering nociceptive pain showed a continuing good median pain reduction of 66.7%. Patients suffering from neuropathic pain showed poor long-term results (11.1% median pain reduction). Neuropathic pain in the extremities reacted least to the application of intrathecal opioids. Optimal results were obtained for nociceptive pain in the trunk area of the body."

CD008686,0,11408936,0,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with spinal involvement: the Sheffield Lymphoma Group experience (1970-2000).,"Spinal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is rare. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and histopathologic records of 39 consecutive patients referred to the Sheffield Lymphoma Group from 1970 to 2000 and analysed the prognostic differences between localised (stage IE and IIE) and secondary (stage III and IV) spinal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (S-NHL) patients. Forty-five percent of all patients were over 60 years old. More patients were male (58%); presented with stage IE and IIE (63%), mostly of intermediate/high grade histology (74%); over a third had symptoms; nearly a third (11 patients) were paraplegic and 14 had sphincter dysfunction at diagnosis. The overall survival of all patients was 39% at 5 years (median 24.7 months), whilst that of localised S-NHL was 51% (median 89.7 months). Univariate analysis showed better survival for patients with good mobility status at presentation (p < 0.0l) and complete response to initial treatment (p < 0.00l). In primary S-NHL, histology (p < 0.05) significantly influenced overall survival. In conclusion, disease is frequently locally advanced at presentation with aggressive histologic grade: thorough staging should always be performed to exclude widespread disease. Good mobility status predicts for good survival outcome. Optimal treatment is still uncertain."

CD008686,0,11394620,0,"Phosphate, the renal tubule, and the musculoskeletal system.","A component of ATP, phosphate is at the hub of the energy-related mechanisms operative in muscle cells. Together with calcium, phosphate is involved in bone tissue mineralization: thus, a chronic alteration in the metabolism of phosphate can induce bone and joint disorders. Diagnosis of chronic hypophosphatemia. Serum phosphate, calcium, and creatinine should be assayed simultaneously. Serum calcium is increased in hypophosphatemia caused by hyperparathyroidism and decreased in osteomalacia. Urinary phosphate excretion should be measured in patients with a normal serum calcium level and a serum phosphate level lower than 0.80 mmol/L. A decrease in urinary phosphate excretion to less than 10 mmol/24 h strongly suggests a gastrointestinal disorder, such as malabsorption, antacid use, or chronic alcohol abuse. In patients with a urinary phosphate excretion greater than 20 mmol/24 h, the maximal rate of tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TmPO4) and the ratio of TmPO4 over glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be determined to look for phosphate diabetes. Manifestations and causes of phosphate diabetes in adults. Moderately severe phosphate diabetes in adults manifests as chronic fatigue, depression, spinal pain, and polyarthralgia, with osteoporosis ascribable to increased bone resorption. Although many cases are idiopathic, investigations should be done to look for X-linked vitamin D-resistant rickets missed during childhood, a mesenchymatous tumor, or Fanconi's syndrome with renal wasting of phosphate, glucose, and amino acids. Management of phosphate diabetes. Phosphate supplementation and, in patients with normal urinary calcium excretion, calcitriol produce some improvement in the symptoms and increase the bone mineral density.

CD008686,0,11394458,0,Results and side effects of high-intensity focused ultrasound in localized prostate cancer.,"At the time of diagnosis, prostate cancer is organ confined in 70% of the cases. A quarter of these patients undergo local therapy (surgery/radiation); 75% risk disease progression by ""watchful waiting"" or systemic side effects through hormonal ablation. Local high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), as minimal invasive tissue coagulation (85 degrees C), ablates prostatic tissue with high precision. Since April 1996, 184 patients have undergone 232 sessions of transrectal HIFU therapy (average 90 min) under spinal anesthesia at 2.25/3.0 MHz, 50 W, and a penetration depth of 25 mm. The follow-up serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration, sextant biopsies, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life measures (QoL), and complaint registration provide the foundation for this clinical evaluation. Follow-up sextant biopsies (an average of 1.9) showed 80% of the patients to be cancer free. In men with residual cancer, the tumor mass was reduced more than 90%. The PSA nadir in 97% was <4 ng/mL, including 61% with values <0.5 ng/mL. After primary HIFU, no severe side effects (fistula, second or third grade incontinence, rectal mucosal burns) occurred. All patients had a suprapubic tube (average 29 days), and 33% needed a transurethral debris resection averaging 7 g. They were discharged within 23 hours. According to the short-term follow-up transrectal HIFU enables minimal invasive local prostate tissue ablation with high rates of negative biopsies, low PSA nadir, and low complication rate."

Total spondylectomy was performed by bisecting the affected vertebra through the pedicle using fine threadwire saws and removing the vertebra en bloc through the posterior procedure alone or the one-stage anteroposterior combined procedure. Remarkable pain relief and ambulation after surgery were achieved in all 14 patients. No serious complications occurred. Nerve roots were sacrificed in seven cases. A marginal surgical margin was achieved in 10 cases and an intralesional surgical margin was achieved in four. At the site of the osteotomized pedicle, the surgical margin was marginal, with the possibility of tumor-cell contamination in 10 cases. Local recurrence was found in three cases of posterior total spondylectomy at 0.3 to 3.5 years (mean, 3.2 years) follow-up evaluation at the other site of the osteotomized pedicle. These results suggest that this type of total spondylectomy is effective in controlling local recurrence without incurring major complications and is a clinically useful procedure."

The outcome of surgical treatment of intra- and extramedullary intradural metastases is considered to be poor, with rapid clinical deterioration. The question of optimal treatment remains controversial. We present an overview of the clinical outcome and surgical treatment of 220 spinal metastases carried out in our centre from 1980 to 1999, with particular emphasis on 11 intradural metastases. Clinical history, signs, surgical approach, outcome, and radiological reports were obtained by review of patient charts. Secondary spinal tumours most often originated from carcinomas of the breast, lung, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and prostate. In 12% of cases, no primary tumour could be found. Drop metastases of intracranial pathology appeared in 3%. Intradural metastases were seen in 11 patients and formed a very heterogeneous group with predominance of melanoma, lymphoma, and medulloblastoma. Functional recovery and survival time were worse in intradural metastases than in extradural metastases, and the patients were younger. Treatment of metastases is designed to relieve pain and preserve or restore neurological function palliatively. Intradural metastases are a devastating condition with usually fatal outcome.

In the first case the symptoms included increased paraesthesia, pain, paraparesis and sphincter disorders, which appeared 16 years after stab wound of meninges and the spinal cord at Th10. In the second patient, operated on for myelomeningocele at L3-4 at the age of five, sphincter disorders, trophic changes of feet and paraparesis appeared. The third patient was operated on for intra- and extramedullary lipoma at Th9-12. Seven months after the operation symptoms of sphincter disorders, pain, paraesthesia and paraparesis developed. The MR examination showed in all patients an adhesion of the posterior or posterolateral surface of the spinal cord with the dura mater at the sites of injury, which was confirmed intraoperatively. An operative treatment improved the clinical state. The tethering of the cord by the scar was the cause of a non-physiological stretching of the spinal cord on flexion of the body and head. It led to spinal circulation disorders and symptoms of myelopathy. It has been observed that the onset of the symptoms is often caused by sudden stretching of the spinal cord during fall or intense physical exercises. In such cases operative release of the spinal cord from the adhesion is a method of choice."
CD008686,0,11311464,0,Cauda equina syndrome.,"Single or double-level compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots located in the dural sac results in a polyradicular symptomatology clinically diagnosed as cauda equina syndrome. The cauda equina nerve roots provide the sensory and motor innervation of most of the lower extremities, the pelvic floor and the sphincters. Therefore, in a fully developed cauda equina syndrome, multiple signs of sensory disorders may appear. These disorders include low-back pain, saddle anesthesia, bilateral sciatica, then motor weakness of the lower extremities or chronic paraplegia and, bladder dysfunction. Multiple etiologies can cause the cauda equina syndrome. Among them, non-neoplastic compressive etiologies such as herniated lumbosacral discs and spinal stenosis and spinal neoplasms play a significant role in the development of the cauda equina syndrome. Non-compressive etiologies of the cauda equina syndrome include ischemic insults, inflammatory conditions, spinal arachnoiditis and other infectious etiologies. The use of canine, porcine and rat models mimicking the cauda equina syndrome enabled discovery of the effects of the compression on nerve root neural and vascular anatomy, the impairment of impulse propagation and the changes of the neurotransmitters in the spinal cord after compression of cauda equina. The involvement of intrinsic spinal cord neurons in the compression-induced cauda equina syndrome includes anterograde, retrograde and transneuronal degeneration in the lumbosacral segments. Prominent changes of NADPH diaphorase exhibiting, Fos-like immunoreactive and heat shock protein HSP72 were detected in the lumbosacral segments in a short-and long-lasting compression of the cauda equina in the dog. Developments in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with back pain, sciatica and with a herniated lumbar disc are mentioned, including many treatment options available."
CD008686,0,11309212,0,Neuraxial infusion in patients with chronic intractable cancer and noncancer pain.,"Ever since the application in 1980 of morphine for spinal analgesia in patients with refractory cancer pain, spinal infusion therapy has become one of the cornerstones for the management of chronic, medically intractable pain. Initially, spinal infusion therapy was indicated only for patients with cancer pain that could not be adequately controlled with systemic narcotics. However, over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the number of pumps implanted for the treatment of nonmalignant pain. Indeed, ""benign"" pain syndromes, particularly failed back surgery syndrome, are the most common indication for intrathecal opiates. As we have gained more experience with this therapy, it has become apparent that even intrathecal opiates, when administered in the long term, can be associated with problems such as tolerance, hyperalgesia, and other side effects. Consequently, long-term efficacy has not been as significant as had been hoped. Because of the difficulties associated with long-term intrathecal opiate therapy, much of the research, both basic and clinical, has focused on developing alternative nonopioid agents to be used either alone or in combination with opiates. Clinical trials have been and continue to be conducted to evaluate drugs such as clonidine, SNX-111, local anesthetics, baclofen, and many other less common agents to determine their efficacy and potential toxicity for intrathecal therapy. This article reviews the agents developed as alternatives to intrathecal opiates."

CD008686,0,11306912,0,Carney complex--an unexpected finding during puerperium.,"Carney complex is an extremely rare, autosomal dominant, multi-system disorder characterized by multiple neoplasias and lentiginosis. The genetic defect responsible for this complex has been localized to the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p16). The most prevalent clinical manifestations in patients with Carney complex are spotty skin pigmentation, skin and cardiac myxomas, Cushing's syndrome and acromegaly. Here we report the case of a 31-year-old woman with a spontaneous pregnancy. At 32 weeks of gestation, she was admitted to our Department of Obstetrics with hypertension and severe back pain. In addition, she had unusual pigmentation and typical cushingoid features. One day after admission, the pregnancy was terminated by emergency cesarian section because of preeclampsia and pathological CTG. During the postoperative period the severe back pain persisted, and radiographic evaluation revealed a collapse of L(2)/L(3) with severe osteopenia. A CT scan showed a mass in the right suprarenal area. Histopathological examination revealed a primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease. After biochemical confirmation of the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, it was recognized that the patient met the diagnostic criteria for Carney complex."
CD008686,0,11305414,0,Adult medulloblastoma: multiagent chemotherapy.,"In this study, the records of 17 adult patients with medulloblastoma treated with craniospinal radiation and 1 of 2 multiagent chemotherapy protocols were reviewed for progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity, and the patients were compared with each other and with similarly treated children and adults. Records of patients treated at 3 institutions were reviewed. Seventeen medulloblastoma patients (11 female, 6 male) with a median age of 23 years (range, 18-47 years) were treated with surgery, craniospinal radiation (CSRT) plus local boost, and 1 of 2 adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. All tumors were infratentorial (10 in 4th ventricle and 7 in left or right hemisphere). Ten patients presented with hydrocephalus, and 7 of them were shunted. Eight patients had gross total resection, 7 had subtotal resection (>50% removed), and 2 had partial resection (<50% removed). Postoperatively, 3 patients had positive cytology and 3 had positive spinal MRI. Five patients were classified as good risk and 12 were classified as poor risk (Chang staging system). Ten patients were treated with the ""Packer protocol,"" consisting of CSRT plus weekly vincristine followed by 8 cycles of cisplatin, lomustine, and vincristine. Seven patients were treated with the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) protocol, consisting of alternating courses of cisplatin/etoposide and cyclophosphamide/vincristine, followed by CSRT. Eight of 17 patients relapsed, with all 8 relapsing at the primary site. Other relapse sites included the leptomeninges (5), bone (1), and brain (1). The estimated median relapse-free survival (Kaplan-Meier) for all patients was 48 months (95% confidence interval, >26 months to infinity). Median relapse-free survival for patients on the Packer protocol was 26 months, and for those on the POG regimen was 48 months (P = 0.410). Five of 10 on the Packer protocol were relapse-free, while 4 of 7 were relapse-free on the POG regimen. Two patients relapsed during chemotherapy and 6 relapsed after completing all therapy at 18, 18, 26, 30, 40, and 48 months. The estimated median survival of all patients was 56 months (95% confidence interval, 27 to infinity) with 11 patients alive; for the Packer protocol, median survival was 36 months, and for the POG protocol, it was 57 months (P = 0.058). The hazard ratio was 0 (95% confidence interval, 0 to infinity). Toxicity during the Packer protocol was moderately severe, with only 1 of 10 patients able to complete all therapy. Two patients had severe abdominal pain during CSRT + vincristine, and 5 had peripheral neuropathy during vincristine therapy. Hearing loss (>20 dB) occurred in 7, neutropenia (<500 microl) in 6, thrombocytopenia (<50,000 microl) in 6, nephrotoxicity (>25% decrease by creatinine clearance) in 2, and decreased pulmonary function (diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide decrease >40%) in 1. On the POG protocol, only 1 patient had persistent nausea and vomiting, 2 had peripheral neuropathy, and 3 had hearing deficit (>20 dB) or tinnitus. The POG and Packer protocols did not have a statistically significant difference in relapse-free or overall survival because of the small sample size. The POG protocol seemed to have less nonhematologic toxicity. Adults on the Packer protocol appeared to have shorter median survival and greater toxicity than did children. To know whether adding adjuvant chemotherapy to craniospinal radiation in adult therapy increases relapse-free and overall survival, we must await the results of a larger randomized controlled clinical trial."

She had a 40-year history of sinusitis, nasal polyp and analgesic-induced asthma; however, asthma had never occurred when she used a 0.3% ketoprofen adhesive patch (Mohrus) for stiff shoulder or lumbago. In the hospital, a life-threatening asthma attack suddenly occurred two and a half hours after application of a 2.0% ketoprofen adhesive tape (Mohrus tape) to her shoulder. She was treated with bronchodilator and glucocorticoid and extubated after 20 hours. A drug lymphocyte stimulating test (DLST) was strongly positive for ketoprofen. We suspected that drug-induced hypersensitivity coexisted in the present case, but it was not clear whether or not the hypersensitivity was related to the pathogenesis of analgesic-induced asthma."
CD008686,0,11296363,0,[A case of multiple cavernous angioma with dementia].,"We reported a 65-year-old man who developed dementia since 50 years of age. His consciousness was clear but he was indifferent to his illness. Also, the luck of attention was recognized when we underwent examinations and the result of intellectual test varied every time we performed. His memory function was almost normal on the examination which was performed when he was cooperative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed multiple tiny lesions (more than 130 in all) in cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord. These lesions were compatible with multiple cavernous angioma. Most of lesions manifested high-density area on cranial CT. Though the multiplicity of foci indicated the possibility of familial occurrence, he was considered to be a sporadic case on his lineage investigation and the brain MRI of his only son. In this case, neither headache nor seizures which were known as the major clinical features of intracerebral cavernous angioma was observed. He was diagnosed as having white matter dementia characterized by attentional dysfunction, decrement of volition and less memory disturbance. We speculated that he developed symptomatic dementia by the sum of multiple minor degeneration, especially in frontal lobe white matter, caused by repeated minor bleeding from cavernous angiomas."

CD008686,0,11290501,0,The value of MR neurography for evaluating extraspinal neuropathic leg pain: a pictorial essay.,"Fifteen patients with neuropathic leg pain referable to the lumbosacral plexus or sciatic nerve underwent high-resolution MR neurography. Thirteen of the patients also underwent routine MR imaging of the lumbar segments of the spinal cord before undergoing MR neurography. Using phased-array surface coils, we performed MR neurography with T1-weighted spin-echo and fat-saturated T2-weighted fast spin-echo or fast spin-echo inversion recovery sequences, which included coronal, oblique sagittal, and/or axial views. The lumbosacral plexus and/or sciatic nerve were identified using anatomic location, fascicular morphology, and signal intensity as discriminatory criteria. None of the routine MR imaging studies of the lumbar segments of the spinal cord established the cause of the reported symptoms. Conversely, MR neurography showed a causal abnormality accounting for the clinical findings in all 15 cases. Detected anatomic abnormalities included fibrous entrapment, muscular entrapment, vascular compression, posttraumatic injury, ischemic neuropathy, neoplastic infiltration, granulomatous infiltration, neural sheath tumor, postradiation scar tissue, and hypertrophic neuropathy."

One patient had a history of rheumatoid arthritis. Unilateral occipital pain was the main symptom. Neuroradiological work-up included open mouth anteroposterior radiograph, flexion/extension lateral radiograph of the cervical spine, CT scan with coronal and sagittal reconstruction and MRI. Findings allowed differential diagnosis with tumoral or infectious disease of upper cervical spine and ruled out C1-C2 instability. CT scan and MRI permitted precise operative planning by determining the course of vertebral artery in the C1 and C2 vertebrae. Two patients were treated by CT scan guided steroid injection. The third patient was treated by C1-C2 arthodesis after failure of conservative treatment."
CD008686,0,11282037,0,Neck and Back Pain in the Elderly.,"Surgical intervention for neck and back pain in elderly patients without significant comorbidities can significantly improve a patient's symptoms and quality of life when more conservative therapies fail. Current spine literature strongly supports the paradigm of treating elderly patients with stable, chronic neck or back pain with conservative therapies first in order to optimize the risks and benefits of all available treatment options. If less-invasive methods fail to achieve satisfactory outcomes, more aggressive surgical options can, at that time, typically be implemented with excellent results in elderly patients without significant comorbidities. Clinical scenarios threatening to result in spine instability or nerve root or spinal cord compression require immediate intervention, especially in elderly patients, who, in general, have a higher risk of developing such conditions either through falls or trauma or acquired degenerative disease processes or malignancies. When an elderly patient enters a physician's office and asks ""doctor, I've had pain for years, but it's getting worse. At my age, is it really worth having surgery?"" The answer is a qualified ""yes,"" if conservative treatments have failed and if the patient is otherwise in reasonably good health. Because the vast majority of these patients first interact with the medical system through their primary care doctors and neurologists, early recognition of situations requiring immediate attention, and those requiring referrals to spine specialists, can greatly expedite the appropriate use of scarce healthcare resources. Furthermore, knowledge of the various treatment options available to elderly patients complaining of the very common symptoms of neck or back pain can significantly improve patient care, especially in this new century when older patients will increasingly become a larger and more active force in all aspects of our society."

CD008686,0,11255688,0,[Hamartoma of the spleen].,"Hamartoma is a rare benign lesion of the spleen. Between 140 and 150 cases seem to have been described so far. Hamartoma of the spleen may appear as a single or multiple lesions which may tend to converge. It appears in all ages, mainly in elderly persons. About 20% of patients were described in paediatric subjects. Half of the patients have no symptoms, so that hamartomas were discovered by chance at autopsy. Other 50% of patients had pain, splenomegaly, haematologic abnormalities (most frequently thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia) and spontaneous rupture with intra-abdominal bleeding. In children, hamartoma of the spleen with haematologic abnormalities may be followed by growth retardation, frequent infections, fever and night sweating. The bigger the hamartoma the greater probability to cause symptoms. The exact preoperative diagnosis is rarely established. Hamartoma has to be taken into account always when tumour of the spleen is diagnosed, particularly in children. Splenectomy is the most frequent treatment of symptomatic hamartoma of the spleen. Partial splenic resection is the preferred surgery whenever it may be carried out, particularly in children. We report a 58 year old woman with a five-year history of left subcostal and lumbar pain in whom in the lower pole of moderately enlarged spleen a tumorous mass, 107 x 75 mm in diameter, was discovered on ultrasonography. She was submitted to splenectomy as well as to cholecystectomy due to gall bladder stones. Histological findings of the spleen showed hamartoma. She had an uneventful recovery. The pain disappeared after surgery. She stayed symptom free so far."

CD008686,0,11250631,0,Odontogenic keratocyst: Review of 256 cases for recurrence and clinicopathologic parameters.,"Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) is of particular interest because of its high recurrence rate and aggressive behavior. Two hundred fifty-six cases of OKC were reviewed for the age of the patient at diagnosis, sex of the patient, OKC location, and radiographic findings, and 132 patients with OKC were observed to estimate recurrence, which was analyzed for age, sex, location, and several histopathologic findings. OKCs occurred more frequently in men (58.6%) than in women (41.4%), and they occurred in patients within a wide age range, most commonly in patients in the third decade of life (28.9%), followed by those in the second decade (25.0%); the mean age of patients with OKC was 30.8 years. One hundred ninety-six of the 256 cases (76.5%) occurred in the mandible, and the other 60 cases (23.5%) occurred in the maxilla. The mandibular molar and the premolar areas (51.2%) were the most common sites, and the most frequent clinical manifestations at first admission were swelling, pain, or both (82.4% of total cases). Radiographic impressions included dentigerous cyst (27.3%), OKC (25.4%), primordial cyst (14.8%), ameloblastoma (11.7%), residual cyst (9.8%), and radicular cyst (3.1%). The frequency of recurrence at the follow-up examination was 58.3%. There was no significant difference in the recurrence rate on the basis of the sex of the patient. However, OKCs had a significantly higher recurrence rate in patients in the fifth decade of life than in patients in the other age groups (P = .005).Recurrence rates were significantly dependent on the sites of involvement, and OKCs in the mandibular molar region had significantly higher recurrence rates than those in other sites (P = .001). The histopathologic presence of one or more daughter cysts was significantly related to recurrence (P = .03)."

There was no evidence of infection, trauma, malignancy, or other disease that could cause the lesion. We treated the patient with analgesics and NSAIDs and the pain remitted over a period of 1 week. In a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging 7 months later, the L5 lesion had disappeared completely. A computed tomography scan analysis with a bone window showed a sclerotic area at the L5 vertebral body.

A thorough neurologic examination should be performed, with abnormal findings warranting neuroimaging to rule out intracranial pathology. The preferred imaging modality to rule out hemorrhage is noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scanning followed by lumbar puncture if the CT scan is normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more expensive than CT scanning and less widely available; however, MRI reveals more detail and is necessary for imaging the posterior fossa. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can help to confirm or rule out hemorrhage, infection, tumor and disorders related to CSF hypertension or hypotension.

The duration of pain ranged from 1 to 6 years. Five patients had incomplete paraplegia at admission. Spine deformity was observed in patients with osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, hemangioma, and vertebral echinococcal involvement. All patients underwent clinical evaluation, laboratory studies, and histologic studies. Electromyogram studies were performed in patients who had a neurologic deficit or nerve root irritation. Imaging evaluation consisted of plain films, bone scans, computed tomography scans, and magnetic resonance imaging scans. Fifteen patients had lumbar involvement; 7 had thoracic involvement. For 18 patients, management included tumor excision and thorough debridement of the lesion. Spinal instrumentation and fusion were used to correct the deformity and treat the instability in 5 patients. Patients were followed for 1 to 8 years. Of the 5 patients with incomplete paraplegia, 4 recovered completely, and the fifth (who had spinal cord hemangioma) improved 2 grades on Frankel's scale. The remaining patients were disease free and returned to routine daily activities. Benign tumors or tumor-like lesions of the thoracolumbar or lumbar spine are very rare and easily misdiagnosed in patients with persistent back pain. Patients whose symptoms progress or fail to respond over an appropriate period of time should be evaluated further. Complete excision of the tumor followed by spinal instrumentation in the presence of deformity or instability is the treatment of choice."

It is most unusual for it to present in the posterior mediastinum as a primary solitary lesion. Discussed here is the case report of a patient who initially presented with musculoskeletal pain. Subsequent investigations, however, revealed the cause to be an EMP; diagnosis was made on finding aggregates of plasma cells on histological examination of the tissue specimen. The latter had been obtained by way of a computerised tomography scan guided biopsy of the tumour. Bone marrow aspiration studies showed no evidence of multiple myelomatosis. There was significant clinical improvement in response to radiotherapy. It is possible that this might represent one of the first documented reports of a primary solitary EMP in the posterior mediastinum."

Clinical examination revealed a retroperitoneal bulky tumor, a breast tumor, and lymphoblasts in bone marrow. She did not have surface lymph node swelling or systemic symptoms such as weight loss and night sweats. Lymphoblasts in bone marrow were positive for CD10 and CD19 but negative for CD20, surface immunoglobulin, and T-cell antigens. Needle biopsy of a retroperitoneal mass revealed diffuse infiltration of lymphoblastic tumor cells. Because the cells were immunoreactive for CD79a, CD10, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, the patient was diagnosed as having precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma (which is rare in adults) with bone marrow involvement. The patient achieved complete remission by an induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, and has remained in complete remission for more than 3 years."

CD008686,0,11193500,0,The role of cyclooxygenase-2 and inflammatory cytokines in pain induction of herniated lumbar intervertebral disc.,"Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is the disease which is the major cause of radiculopathy. In terms of the pathogenesis of disease, it is reported that prostaglandinE2 (PGE2) plays an important role to induce radiculopathy. Arachidonate cascade, which is the process of PGE2 synthesis, is mainly regulated by two kinds of enzymes, phospholipaseA2 (PLA2) and cyclooxy genase (COX). Previously, PLA2 was recognized as the rate-limiting enzyme of this cascade, and some authors reported the clinical significance of PLA2 at the site of LDH concerning the radicular pain. Recently, COX was elucidated to consist of 2 types of isoform, a constitutive form of COX-1 and an inducible form of COX-2. COX-2 has been focused as a key enzyme to regulate PGE2 synthesis and plays an important role in inflammation, because COX-2 was induced in many types of cells by the stimulation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). However, it is not fully discussed whether or not, COX-2 is induced in lumbar disc tissue and if it plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of LDH. To clarify the role of COX-2 in the pathomechanism of radiculopathy of LDH, we have investigated the expression of COX-2, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha in herniated lumbar disc tissue. Immunohistologically, they were detected in the cytosol of chondrocytes constituting the disc tissue. RT-PCR showed that herniated lumbar disc-derived cells expressed mRNA of COX-2, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha in the presence of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. The disc-derived cells also produced much PGE2 by stimulating of inflammatory cytokines at the same time and this PGE2 production was distinctly suppressed by a selective inhibitor of COX-2, 6-methoxy-2-naphtyl acetic acids (6MNA). These results suggest that COX-2 and inflammatory cytokines might play a causative role in the radiculopathy of LDH through upregulating PGE2 synthesis."
CD008686,0,11180753,0,Low Back Pain.,"Low back problems are extremely common. In the United States, it is estimated that 15% to 20% of the population, and approximately half of working-age adults, admit to back pain each year. Low back pain (LBP) is a symptom and not a specific disease, and there are a large number of potential causes. The vast majority of patients with LBP have a musculoskeletal cause. Ninety percent of patients with acute low back problems recover within a month with very conservative treatment. Because of the multiple possible causes in the musculoskeletal category, and because of the self-limited nature of most patients' pain, only about 15% of patients can be given a specific diagnosis to explain their LBP. Although 90% of patients with LBP have self-limited disease, recurrent attacks of pain are common, and approximately 10% of patients develop chronic LBP. In general, LBP is over-evaluated and over-treated, which results in wasted money and medical resources, and often yields inferior clinical outcomes. The physician's job, when evaluating a patient with acute LBP, is to look for ""red flags""--symptoms and signs that should prompt additional evaluation and treatment. Without ""red flag"" conditions, LBP should be treated with ""comfort control"" measures only. These measures include activity modification and the use of simple analgesics. Manipulation therapy may be helpful in the short term (within the first month of onset), although other physical therapies are more helpful beyond 1 month from onset. Surgical intervention on the spine for patients without tumors, infection, and fracture should be reserved for patients with progressive or unrelenting compression of one or more lumbosacral nerve roots by a herniated intervertebral disk. Neurologists should be involved in the evaluation and treatment of patients with LBP, because many of the worrisome underlying conditions affect the nerve roots, and most of the surgical interventions are based on documentation of the presence of nerve root impingement. Neurologists can determine if these indications are present, and do not have a vested interest in recommending costly procedures."

A 33-year-old woman reported a 1-year history of dull lumbar pain on the right side. A right renal parapelvic cyst was suspected. The patient underwent retroperitoneoscopic exploration. The right renal parapelvic lesion was identified as a soft tissue tumor. The tumor was removed with a retroperitoneoscopic procedure. Histopathological findings revealed neurofibroma.
CD008686,0,11161391,0,Less pain does equal better quality of life following strontium-89 therapy for metastatic prostate cancer.,"93 patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer were entered on a prospective study to measure reduction in pain and changes in quality of life (QoL) after the administration of 150 MegaBequerel (MBq) Strontium-89 (Sr-89). QoL was assessed using a validated instrument, the Functional Living Index - Cancer (FLIC) questionnaire. Pain response was measured using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system. Overall there was limited QoL improvement over 3 months following Sr-89. However, in the 53 patients (63%) achieving pain responses, QoL did significantly improve within 6 weeks of receiving Sr-89 compared to patients with stable or worsening bone pain, and this was independent of other parameters that might influence QoL outcomes, such as performance status, baseline PSA and extent of skeletal disease (P = 0.004). PSA 'response' occurred in 30 patients (37%) over 4 months after Sr-89. This did not appear to correlate with clinical improvement. This study supports the presumption that improvement in pain following Sr-89 is accompanied by better QoL. The lack of correlation of PSA response and clinical parameters indicates that in the palliative setting, PSA may not provide a useful surrogate for treatment outcome."
CD008686,0,11161370,0,Intrathecal treatment of neoplastic meningitis due to breast cancer with a slow-release formulation of cytarabine.,"DepoCyte is a slow-release formulation of cytarabine designed for intrathecal administration. The goal of this multi-centre cohort study was to determine the safety and efficacy of DepoCyte for the intrathecal treatment of neoplastic meningitis due to breast cancer. DepoCyte 50 mg was injected once every 2 weeks for one month of induction therapy; responding patients were treated with an additional 3 months of consolidation therapy. All patients had metastatic breast cancer and a positive CSF cytology or neurologic findings characteristic of neoplastic meningitis. The median number of DepoCyte doses was 3, and 85% of patients completed the planned 1 month induction. Median follow up is currently 19 months. The primary endpoint was response, defined as conversion of the CSF cytology from positive to negative at all sites known to be positive, and the absence of neurologic progression at the time the cytologic conversion was documented. The response rate among the 43 evaluable patients was 28% (CI 95%: 14-41%); the intent-to-treat response rate was 21% (CI 95%: 12-34%). Median time to neurologic progression was 49 days (range 1-515(+)); median survival was 88 days (range 1-515(+)), and 1 year survival is projected to be 19%. The major adverse events were headache and arachnoiditis. When drug-related, these were largely of low grade, transient and reversible. Headache occurred on 11% of cycles; 90% were grade 1 or 2. Arachnoiditis occurred on 19% of cycles; 88% were grade 1 or 2. DepoCyte demonstrated activity in neoplastic meningitis due to breast cancer that is comparable to results reported with conventional intrathecal agents. However, this activity was achieved with one fourth as many intrathecal injections as typically required in conventional therapy. The every 2 week dose schedule is a major advantage for both patients and physicians."

Intramedullary metastases are rare and represent only 4-8.5% of central nervous system metastases. An important feature of intramedullary metastases is the rapid progression of neurological deficits which necessitates rapid treatment. There are only eight earlier reports of intramedullary metastasis due to renal cell carcinoma (Schiff D, O'Neill BP. Intramedullary spinal cord metastases: clinical features and treatment outcome.

CD008686,0,11153977,0,Computed tomography findings in patients with sacroiliac pain.,"This retrospective study evaluated the diagnostic value of computed tomography in patients with sacroiliac pain. Computed tomography scans of the sacroiliac joints of 62 patients with sacroiliac joint pain were reviewed. The criteria to include the patient in the current study were pain relief after a local injection in the sacroiliac joint under computed tomography guidance, a physical examination consistent with a sacroiliac origin of the pain, and negative magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine. A control group consisted of 50 patients of matched age who had computed tomography scans of the pelvis for a reason other than pelvic or back pain. Computed tomography scans showed one or more findings in 57.5% and 31% of the sacroiliac joints in the symptomatic and the control groups, respectively. The computed tomography scans were negative in 37 (42.5%) symptomatic sacroiliac joints with a positive sacroiliac joint injection test. The sensitivity of computed tomography was 57.5 % and its specificity was 69%. The finding of the current study suggests limited diagnostic value of computed tomography in sacroiliac joint disease because of its low sensitivity and specificity. With clinical suspicion of a sacroiliac origin of pain, intraarticular injection is currently the only means to confirm that diagnosis."

Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of normal and pathologic bone resorption and represent a significant therapeutic improvement in the management of patients with lytic bone metastases. Zoledronic acid is a new-generation, highly potent, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that to the authors knowledge is the most potent inhibitor of bone resorption currently in clinical trials. The objectives of the current study were to assess the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of zoledronic acid and to determine its activity with respect to reducing biochemical markers of bone resorption in cancer patients with bone metastases."

CD008686,0,11144077,0,[Radiotherapy of vertebral hemangiomas].,"The paper presents the analysis of results of treatment with radiotherapy of 14 cases of vertebral hemangiomas. All patients were irradiated in accordance with conventional schedule fractionated doses, using 2 Gy per fraction. The total radiation dose amounted to 20 Gy (1 case), 24 Gy (4 cases) and 30 Gy (9 cases). The degree of pain relief and lesion reossification was assessed 1 months and 6 months after completion of radiotherapy. Complete pain relief 1 month post radiotherapy was noted in 5 cases (on average patients claimed that radiotherapy resulted in a 70% decrease of pain syndromes). Six months post radiotherapy complete pain relief was noted in 8 cases (on average patients reported a 90% decrease in pain). Signs of reossification were observed in cases 6 months after treatment. No correlation was noted neither between the degree of pain relief and reossification, nor between the total delivered dose and the degree of pain relief. The obtained results allow to conclude that conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (using 20-24 Gy as total dose) is a good method of analgetic treatment of vertebral hemangiomas probably based on the anti-inflammatory effect of radiation."
CD008686,0,11141722,0,Atypical case of metastatic undifferentiated prostate carcinoma in a 36 years old man: clinical report and literature review.,"Prostate carcinoma occurs infrequently in patient less than 50 years old with an incidence of 0.8% to 1.1%. In literature are described less than 20 cases occurred in younger men (< 40 years old). A 36 year-old man with a two-months history of lower back pain, anorexia and loss of weight, showed at clinical examination a mild enlargement of inguinal lymph nodes and right inferior leg and scrotus edema. CT scan demonstrated marked enlargement and fusion of pelvic, inguinal, sacral and periaortic nodes with a pelvic mass that caused local ureterohydronephrosis and obstruction of the urinary flow. X-rays showed osteoblastic metastases. At total body scintigram were observed fixation areas corresponding to lumbar metamers, pelvis, thigh bones, left humeral head, left acromioclavicular articulation and multiple ribs. Tumor markers resulted negative except prostate specific antigen (PSA: 500 mgr/ml) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP: 208 U/l); prostate biopsy showed an undifferentiated carcinoma. The patient was submitted to right percutaneous nephrostomy, chemotherapy (PEB, cisplatinum, etoposide and bleomycin for 6 cycles) and ormonotherapy (LHRH analogues) reporting a clinical partial response. After 6 months the disease progressed and was started a second line chemotherapy. After 18 months from diagnosis patient is still alive with progressing disease. Our patient represents, with respect to many features, an original clinical case of prostate carcinoma occurring in young age, for the atypical association of an undifferentiated carcinoma with high levels of PSA and PAP and with osteoblastic-pattern of bone metastases. Further studies would be useful to identify new risk factors for development of prostate cancer in young men in order to achieve early diagnosis."
CD008686,0,11135274,0,Pelvic cancer pain.,"Pelvic cancer causes several types of pain, i.e., visceral, neuropathic, and somatic pain. Somatic pain is due to stimulation of nociceptors in the integument and supporting structures, namely, striated muscles, joints, periosteum, bones, and nerve trunks by direct extension through fascial planes and their lymphatic supply. In 60% of patients with malignant disease of soft tissues, nerve trunk, and sacral invasion from carcinoma of the cervix, uterus, vagina, colon, rectum, and other tissues in women, and from penile, prostate, and colorectal carcinoma and sarcoma in men, they have neuropathic pain. The infiltration of the perineal nerves results in lumbosacral plexopathies and complete destruction of the nerve, including perineural lymphatic invasions producing symptomatic sensory loss, causalgia, and deafferentation. Visceral pain is the result of spasms of smooth muscles of hallow viscus; distortion of capsule of solid organs; inflammation; chemical irritation; traction or twisting of mesentery; and ischemia, or necrosis, and encroachment of pelvis and presacral tumors. Pain of these types is managed by different modalities depending on the age of the patient, the expected life expectancy, availability of invasive and non-invasive pain control modalities, and the resources of the patient, community, and health care agencies. Patients with pelvic cancer can live with less pain due to better pain-control modalities that are available today with the help of dedicated and caring algologists."
CD008686,0,11133065,0,Magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of patients for percutaneous vertebroplasty.,"Osteoporosis and osteoporotic compression fractures of the vertebral bodies are major health problems facing women and older people of both sexes. In the last several years, percutaneous vertebroplasty has been developed as a treatment for pain caused by vertebral body compression fractures and primary or metastatic neoplasms. A large part of the success of this procedure depends on correct patient selection. As such, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in this process. In this review, the clinical evaluation of patients considered for vertebroplasty, the role of MRI in the pretreatment process, the postvertebroplasty appearance of the spine on MRI, and the future applications, such as real-time guidance with MR imaging, will be discussed."

CD008686,0,11114866,0,Optimising treatment of bone metastases by Aredia(TM) and Zometa(TM).,"Metastatic bone disease develops as a result of the many interactions between tumour cells and bone cells. This leads to disruption of normal bone metabolism, with the increased osteoclast activity seen in most, if not all, tumor types providing a rational target for treatment. The clinical course of metastatic bone disease in multiple myeloma, breast and prostate cancers is relatively long, with patients experiencing sequential skeletal complications over a period of several years. These include bone pain, fractures, hypercalcaemia, and spinal cord compression, all of which may profoundly impair a patient's quality of life. External beam radiotherapy and systemic endocrine and cytotoxic treatments are the mainstay of treatment in advanced cancers. However, it is now clear that the bisphosphonates provide an additional treatment strategy, which reduces both the symptoms and complications of bone involvement. Pamidronate (Aredia(TM)) is the most widely evaluated bisphosphonate and is recommended for most patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer with bone metastases. Current research aims include the evaluation of new potent bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid (Zometa(TM)). It is hoped that this compound is not only more convenient and easier to administer but also more effective in inhibiting skeletal morbidity. Zometa may also have some direct anticancer activity. Preclinical studies with Zometa have demonstrated its potential in malignant bone disease. Clinical studies in treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy have been completed, as have Phase I and II trials in patients with cancer and pre-existing bone metastases. Three randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase III trials are now ongoing to establish the efficacy and safety of Zometa in treatment of bone metastases in patients with osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions. Additionally, new specific molecules such as osteoprotogerin have been developed that are based on our improved understanding of the cellular signalling mechanisms involved in cancer induced bone disease. These potent molecules are now entering clinical trials. Ongoing research is aimed at trying to define the optimum route, dose, schedule and type of bisphosphonate in metastatic bone disease and their use in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in cancer patients. In vitro suggestions of direct anti-cancer activity and some promising clinical data in early breast cancer have resulted in considerable interest in the possible adjuvant use of bisphosphonates to inhibit the development of bone metastases."

The purposes of this study was (i) to determine the percentage of children with disabling back pain presenting to our institution who had a diagnosis (i.e., to explain their back pain), (ii) to evaluate the clinical markers that should alert clinicians to underlying pathology, (iii) and to determine the prognosis of children with back pain and no specific diagnosis. This study was a retrospective analysis of consecutive children undergoing single-photon emission computed tomography for a primary complaint of back pain. Data collection included chart review, radiographic analysis, and clinical follow-up with the Roland and Morris scale for pain and disability. Two hundred and seventeen patients with an average age of 13 years (range, 2.7-17.7) were reviewed on average 4.4 years after presentation (range, 1.1-7.2 years). One hundred and seventy children (78.3%) had no specific diagnosis to explain their back pain, 15 children (6.9%) had spondylosis, 10 children (4.6%) had tumor, and the remaining 22 children (10.1%) had various diagnoses including infection, Scheuermann's kyphosis, herniated disc, kidney disease, facet arthritis, degenerative disc disease, congenital anomalies, and tethered cord. Factors associated with positive diagnoses were constant pain and male gender. Night pain, constant pain, and duration of symptoms <3 months were associated with the diagnosis of a tumor. Although the majority of children presenting with persistent back pain had no demonstrable cause, of 132 contactable patients 94 (71%) had persisting pain at the time of clinical follow-up. In conclusion, the majority of children with disabling back pain has no demonstrable cause and the majority will continue to have pain years after initial presentation."

Low backache--when is sacroiliitis the cause?].","Despite the availability of modern imaging modalities, early diagnosis of sacroiliitis remains a challenge. The patient's history and the results of the clinical examination form the basis for establishing a working diagnosis, which then needs to be confirmed by laboratory tests and diagnostic imaging. Common causes of sacroiliitis are inflammatory diseases of the spine, in particular seronegative spondyloarthropathies; infectious sacroiliitis is much less common. Besides serological testing (HLA-B27), imaging techniques are essential for diagnosing early forms of sacroiliitis. The treatment of the condition initially involves the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In patients with infectious sacroiliitis, antibiotics are the treatment of choice. Local application of steroids, or physiotherapy, can be helpful. The value of disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs) (sulfasalazine, methotrexate) has not been verified, and is questionable. New approaches such as anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF alpha) need to be tested in controlled studies."
CD008686,0,11084478,0,[Management of intractable cancer pain: from intrathecal morphine to cell allograft].,"The durable effectiveness of intrathecal morphine administration is well established for the management of intractable cancer pain, after failure of systemic opioids, secondary to the persistence of non-reversible undesirable side effects. Many patients are referred to late in the disease course. This conservative method to control pain of malignant origin must not be reserved for last resort treatment for terminal patients. Intra-cerebro-ventricular morphine administration is a very effective and generally safe method for controlling intractable cancer pain. Because of the chronic implantation of an intra-ventricular catheter this method is somewhat invasive. Its indications remain a simple and effective alternative when the topography of nociceptive pain is diffuse or cephalic. In clinical practice, intrathecal and/or intra-cerebro-ventricular administration of opioids is limited by cost, the need for specialized maintenance and mechanical malfunctions if implantable drug delivery systems, or by the risk of bacterial contamination and ambulatory constraints when repeated daily injections via an intrathecal access port are used. To answer these limitations, cell therapy using intrathecal chromaffin cell allograft is a promising approach for the management of cancer pain refractory to traditional drug therapy and pain lesion surgery. The basic rationale and preclinical studies on experimental pain models have enabled starting prospective clinical trials. Prior to transplantation, handling and preparation of the chromaffin tissue is critical for allograft viability. The initial results of clinical trials with human chromaffin cell grafts from intractable cancer pain have reported long-lasting pain relief, in correlation with met-enkephalin release into the CSF. Convincing evidence will require controlled studies. The limitations of this innovative cell therapy and especially the lack of human adrenal gland availability point to the need for new sources of cells. Perspectives include xenogenic or engineered cell lines."

Adult chronic hip pain: radiographic evaluation.,"Adult chronic hip pain can be difficult to attribute to a specific cause, both clinically and radiographically. Yet, there are often subtle radiographic signs that point to traumatic, infectious, arthritic, neoplastic, congenital, or other causes. Stress fractures appear as a lucent line surrounded by sclerosis or as subtle lucency or sclerosis. Subtle femoral neck angulation, trabecular angulation, or a subcapital impaction line indicates an insufficiency fracture. Apophyseal avulsion fractures appear as a thin, crescentic, ossific opacity when viewed in tangent and as a subtle, disk-shaped opacity when viewed en face. Effusion, cartilage loss, and cortical bone destruction are diagnostic of a septic hip. Transient osteoporosis manifests as osteoporosis and effusion. The earliest finding of avascular necrosis is relative sclerosis in the femoral head. Subtle osteophytes or erosive change is indicative of arthropathy. Osteoarthritis can manifest as early cyst formation, small osteophytes, or buttressing of the femoral neck or calcar. Rheumatoid arthritis may manifest as classic osteopenia, uniform cartilage loss, and erosive change. A disturbance of the trabecular pattern might suggest an early permeative pattern due to a tumor. Knowledge of common causes of chronic hip pain will allow the radiologist to seek out these radiographic findings."

Memory for both event details and the child's emotional responses was assessed one week after the LP. Children of all ages displayed considerable accuracy for event details, and accuracy increased with age. Overall recall accuracy for event details and emotional responses was similar. Recall among children given oral Versed was similar to that among children not given Versed. Finally, higher distress predicted greater exaggerations in negative memory 1 week later (although controlling for age weakened this relationship); moreover, greater exaggerations in negative memory predicted higher distress at a subsequent LP. These results indicate that children's memories play an important role in their experience of distress during repeated stressful events."

CD008686,0,11008278,0,[Patient expectations regarding methods and outcomes of their rehabilitation--a controlled study of back pain- and cancer patients].,"Although patient expectations are important factors of the success of rehabilitation, they have not yet received much attention in research. In the present cross-sectional study, n = 248 rehabilitation patients, n = 160 suffering from chronic back pain and n = 88 suffering from oncological diseases (breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer), were assessed at the time of admission to a rehabilitation clinic, using a newly developed self-report questionnaire to evaluate their expectations regarding the process and outcome of their rehabilitation. Results show on an item level that non-specific process expectations such as balneophysical treatments or features of the surroundings of the clinic were most prevailing. Across both diagnostic groups, common goals of rehabilitation such as reduction of complaints, physical fitness and recreation scored highest. On the basis of factor analysis, 10 scales of process expectations were constructed: medical attention, physical training, vocational counselling, balneophysical treatment, health information, stress management training, support groups, relief from the strains of everyday life, alternative medicine, and pleasant surroundings. Nine dimensions of outcome expectations were detected: ability for work, physical fitness, reduction of complaints, behaviour change, reduction of body weight, positive body feeling, vitality, enjoyment of life, and social contact. In the univariate analysis, orthopaedical patients scored higher on balneophysical treatments and vocational counselling (process expectations) as well as reduction of complaints and ability for work (outcome expectations). However, there were effects of age, gender and working status, too. Thus these differences between diagnostic groups turned out to be nonsignificant after controlling for the effects of age, gender, and working status. On the other hand, some effects of the medical condition had been hidden in the univariate comparison and were only revealed when adjusting for the moderator variables. Those differences show that oncological patients had higher expectations than back pain patients. Patients' expectations were correlated with functional status and, to a lesser degree, emotional distress and locus of control. To conclude, our study demonstrated that medical condition, sociodemographic factors, working status and functional capacity are important determinants of patient expectations regarding the process and outcome of rehabilitation."
CD008686,0,11003800,0,Clinicopathological and molecular biological studies in a patient with neurolymphomatosis.,"We describe a patient with a clinical disorder that resembled vasculitic neuropathy in which peripheral nerves were successively affected over several months, but without systemic involvement. An initial muscle biopsy near the involved nerves showed signs of nonspecific inflammation around the muscle and nerve fibers. Immunosuppressive treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction in pain, but relapses of the disease eventually occurred, and the patient died 22 months after onset of the first symptoms. Pathologically, a malignant non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma, restricted to the intra- and extradural peripheral nervous system, was found. The demonstration by Southern blotting of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement confirmed the monoclonal nature of the lymphomatous cells. In situ hybridization tests for Epstein-Barr and herpes virus subtypes were negative. Our case underlines i) how difficult diagnosis can be despite extensive investigations, ii) the usefulness of immunosuppressive treatment in the early stage of the disease, iii) the importance of immunostaining and genome analysis for distinguishing between different types of human neurolymphomatosis, and iv) the fact that the initial inflammatory process in the muscle biopsy may be interpreted either as a paraneoplastic effect of the lymphoma or as a viral inflammatory neuromyopathy that triggers the development of the malignant lymphoma."

CD008686,0,10998732,0,Malignant bone pain: pathophysiology and treatments.,"Metastatic involvement of the bone is one of the most frequent causes of pain in cancer patients and represents one of the first signs of widespread neoplastic disease. The pain may originate directly from the bone, from nerve root compression, or from muscle spasms in the area of the lesions. The mechanism of metastatic bone pain is mainly somatic (nociceptive), even though, in some cases, neuropathic and visceral stimulations may overlap. The conventional symptomatic treatment of metastatic bone pain requires the use of multidisciplinary therapies, such as radiotherapy, in association with systemic treatment (hormonotherapy, chemotherapy, radioisotopes) with the support of analgesic therapy. Recently, studies have indicated the use of bisphosphonates in the treatment of pain and in the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with metastatic bone disease. In some patients, pharmacologic treatment, radiotherapy, and radioisotopes administered alone or in association are not able to manage pain adequately. The role of neuroinvasive techniques in treating metastatic bone pain is debated. The clinical conditions of the patient, his life expectancy, and quality of life must guide the physician in the choice of the best possible therapy."
CD008686,0,10994690,0,Ultrasound of the adult hip.,"The adult hip is a new and challenging site for evaluation with ultrasound (US). Clinically, diseases involving the hip region may be difficult to diagnose without the help of imaging. The hip region is a crossroad for numerous vascular, nervous, and muscular structures that pass between the trunk and the lower extremity. Thus, inflammatory processes and neoplasms may spread to and from the hip, buttock, thigh, pelvis, and retroperitoneum, and trauma may also effect the adjacent areas of the trunk and thigh. Because it is a crossroad, many conditions that are not specific to the hip occur in this area, including inguinal lymphadenopathy, pathology from the abdomen or the genitalia (intestinal hernia, inflammation, and infection), and even referred pain from spinal disorders. The goals of US imaging are the detection and localization of these pathological processes, the differentiation of intra-articular andextra-articular pathology, and the performance of diagnostic and therapeutic interventional procedures. This article reviews the hip anatomy, followed up by a discussion of the US evaluation and differential diagnosis of common pathology occurring in the hip area. This includes joint effusion, arthritis, loose bodies, bursitis, pseudoaneurysm, muscle and tendon diseases, as well as tumor and tumor-like lesions such as hematoma, abscess, and lymphadenopathy."

CD008686,0,10983260,0,Cervical myelopathy due to an osteochondroma in a 73-year-old female. The oldest case in the literature.,"An osteochondroma is a common developmental tumor of bone characterized by abnormal peri-physeal ectopic enchondral ossification. This results in a cartilage-capped subperiosteal bony projection, which may be either sessile or pedunculated. These lesions are said to grow until skeletal maturity. The cartilage cap is thought to become thinner as the patient ages beyond skeletal maturity. Apparent growth beyond skeletal maturity may be a sign of malignant conversion, usually to a chondroma. Osteochondromas are usually appreciated in the first decades of life, and are most commonly located in the extremities, usually in the knees, ankles, or wrists. Clinical complaints generally relate to the mass effect of the lesion. Solitary osteochondromas of the axial skeleton are less common and may present with a neurological deficit. We report on such a case, in a woman significantly older than other cases described in the literature."
CD008686,0,10981935,0,Intrathecal baclofen withdrawal simulating neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a child with cerebral palsy.,"Intrathecal baclofen infusion (IBI) is being used with increasing frequency in children to treat spasticity and dystonia. In this report, we summarize the clinical course of a 9-year-old boy with quadriplegic cerebral palsy with mixed tonal abnormalities (spasticity and dystonia) experiencing withdrawal from intrathecal baclofen. His clinical course is compared to that of adults experiencing withdrawal from IBI and to neuroleptic malignant syndrome. If unrecognized, this disorder may have significant potential for morbidity and mortality. Clues to diagnosis, appropriate evaluation, and potential treatments are discussed. When a child treated with IBI presents with unexplained multiorgan system dysfunction, particularly if accompanied by evidence of rhabdomyolysis, the integrity of the IBI system must be evaluated. In some cases, evaluation might necessitate surgical exploration. Caregivers most commonly seek urgent evaluation and treatment from their primary care provider when their child experiences fever or acute illness. Primary care providers of children treated with IBI should be made aware of this clinical scenario to prevent delays in diagnosis."

At the posterior triangle, the nerve is closely related to local lymph nodes and may be injured by their enlargement or surgical removal. Injury to this nerve is uncommom. Most cases are iatrogenically due to surgical procedures in the posterior cervical triangle, often following lymph nodes biopsies or benign turmors approaches. We present seven cases of post-surgical related spinal accessory nerve injury and discuss its clinical and electrophysiologycal profiles. The major motor signs were shoulder drop and paresis to raise arm. Pain and sensory complaints were almost universal and most probably due to concomitant injury of cervical plexus cutaneous branches, which are in direct relation to the spinal accessory nerve in the posterior cervical triangle. Lesion type is usually axonotmesis, but varied degrees of compression by cicatricial spurs are observed in some patients. Surgical approach and nerve repair must be considered for pacients with delayed recovery."
CD008686,0,10971191,0,Spinal lipomas in children.,"Spinal cord lipomas are a common cause of cord tethering that can lead to progressive neurological defects. The role of prophylactic surgery for spinal lipomas has recently been questioned. Between 1985 and 1999, 59 children underwent a total of 69 surgical procedures at the Birmingham Children's Hospital in Birmingham, UK. The spinal lipomas were classified into: 18 terminal, 17 transitional, 6 dorsal and 18 filum lipomas - including 12 who had a typical thickened filum terminale. At the first operation, 19 patients (32%) were asymptomatic, and 40 patients (68%) presented with symptoms. Surgical indications in the asymptomatic group included the presence of a dermal sinus tract or syrinx. Prophylactic surgery was undertaken in selected cases. The mean total follow-up for the group since the first surgical procedure was 61.8 months (range: 7.0-203.0 months). In the asymptomatic group, 26% of the patients had late neurological deterioration. Of the 14 patients with asymptomatic conus lipomas, 3 (21%) developed sphincter dysfunction and motor problems at long-term follow-up. In the symptomatic group, 68% improved, 20% remained unchanged, and 12% had late neurological deterioration. None of the 18 patients with symptomatic filum lipoma deteriorated postoperatively. However, 39% had bladder dysfunction, 54% had neuro-orthopaedic deformity, and only 15% returned to overall normal function at latest follow-up. Of the 27 patients with symptomatic conus lipomas, 67% improved, 15% remained stable, and 18% had late neurological deterioration. However, 74% had bladder dysfunction, 67% had neuro-orthopaedic deformity, and 45% had motor problems at long-term follow-up. Spinal lipomas can cause progressive neurological deficits irrespective of spinal untethering surgery. This study demonstrates that filum and conus lipomas have similar clinical presentation, but differ in their outcome following surgery. Filum lipomas are 'benign', for which surgery is safe and effective. Conus lipomas are more difficult to manage. When asymptomatic, our results suggest that prophylactic surgery does provide some protection from future neurological deterioration. When symptomatic, conus lipoma surgery is effective in stopping further deterioration. Improvement in neurological function can occur, but few patients return to normal overall function, and pre-existing sphincter dysfunction is not significantly altered by surgery."
CD008686,0,10959387,0,[Spinal and extra-spinal tumors mimicking discal herniation].,"Low back pain radiating to a limb is usually caused by lumbar disc herniation. Tumors of the spinal cord or near the sciatic or femoral plexus can cause neural compression and clinical signs similar to those of disc herniation. Such tumors are usually misdiagnosed as discal herniation and appropriate treatment is delayed. We present 4 men who had tumors causing low back pain radiating to the leg: a 70-year-old with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, a 20-year-old with aneurysmal bone cyst of the vertebral column, a 52-year-old with retroperitoneal sarcoma and a 32-year-old who also had retroperitoneal sarcoma. Diagnosis and treatment were delayed because the clinical symptoms were ascribed to lumbar disc herniation. The latter 2 patients had CT-scans showing lumbar disc herniation, but similar findings are common among asymptomatic individuals. The differential diagnosis of low back pain radiating to the leg should include tumor when there is a history of cancer, pain not relieved by conservative treatment nor by lying down, pain is increased at night, pain accompanied by weight loss, and when physical examination demonstrates injury to more than 1 nerve root. In these circumstances work-up should include EMG, radioisotope scan and CT of the pelvis."

CD008686,0,10942066,0,Metastatic extragonadal seminoma associated with cardiac transplantation.,"A 37-year-old man who had successfully undergone cardiac transplantation for dilated cardiomyopathy presented with a history of severe pain over his left shoulder, rib cage and thoracic spine. Clinical examination revealed the presence of bony tenderness over these sites, but there was no other clinical evidence of malignancy. Further investigations suggested the presence of multiple bony metastases. Bone biopsy revealed extensive bone marrow infiltration by large undifferentiated cells showing pronounced cytoplasmic vacuolation with a striking granulomatous reaction. Immunocytochemistry revealed these anaplastic cells to be cytokeratin and placenta-like alkaline phosphatase positive but S100, CD30 and lymphoid marker negative. Analyses by in situ hybridisation of these cells revealed no evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection. Overall the pathology suggested a diagnosis of metastatic seminoma. Confirmation of this diagnosis was obtained by the analysis of serum human chorionic gonadotrophin which was elevated at 90 IU/l. In the absence of testicular or retroperitoneal disease, it is very likely that this unusual case of metastatic seminoma was related to the patient's immunosuppressive therapy, which at diagnosis included cyclosporin and prednisolone. The patient was successfully treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy and decreased immunosuppression and remains in complete remission one year after completion of chemotherapy. Seminoma is an uncommon complication of prolonged immunosuppression with very few cases being described in the literature post-organ transplantation. This case shows that the clinical presentation of this treatable tumour in this patient population can be unusual and difficult to diagnose."

In case 1, surgical resection of a venous hemangioma in the lumbar epidural space was performed but did not relieve pain. In case 2, conservative treatments for a protruded disk were performed for 3 months before an accurate diagnosis was made. After correct diagnoses were made, excision of the femoral tumors brought rapid relief of all abnormal findings in both cases. Compared with other causes of sciatica, femoral bone tumors are rare. However, careful attention should be paid to rule out these lesions if the diagnosis of a lumbar spinal disease is uncertain. Bone scintigraphy seems to be a sensitive diagnostic method to detect extraspinal osseous lesions."

The aim of this survey was to assess the prevalence of this disease in children from the Seine-Maritime and L'Eure, hospitalized in pediatric wards in the Seine-Maritime department, which includes Rouen, Dieppe, Fécamp, Elbeuf, and Le Havre. Fifteen cases of Lyme disease were diagnosed between September 1988 and June 1997. The children (6 girls and 9 boys) were aged between 5 and 14 years old. Only 7 subjects showed primary symptoms, while secondary symptoms were observed in 12 children. In the study population, a high prevalence (11 out of the 15 children) of neurological disorders was found. The following secondary symptoms were noted: 5 cases of erythema migrans, 2 cases of non-malignant cutaneous lymphocytoma, and 4 cases which in fact had previously displayed primary clinical signs (3 subjects with erythema migrans and 1 subject with non-malignant cutaneous lymphocytoma); 7 cases of uni- or bilateral facial paralysis, the most frequent neurological manifestation with or without lymphocytic meningitis; 1 case of central vestibular syndrome with a hyperalgesic meningoradicular reaction in the vicinity of the tick bite; 1 case of peripheral radicular involvement and intense pain in the left lower limb; 4 cases of ocular disorders (3 diplopias, 1 bilateral conjunctivitis complicated by kerato-uveitis, 1 bilateral complete cecitis). Only 10 child had rheumatological symptoms, i.e., Lyme arthritis of the right knee. Treatment consisted of amoxicillin (10 children) administered at a dosage of 50 to 100 mg/kg/d over a period ranging from 10 days to 1 month, or ceftriaxone (7 children) at a dosage of 50 to 100 mg/kg/d administered intravenously over a period ranging from 8 days to 3 weeks.

Computerized axial tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies showed a 3.5 X 3.0 cm sacral mass within the spinal canal in the region of the left S2 nerve root. A fine-needle aspirate biopsy (FNAB) was performed under CT guidance. The cytologic findings included a spindle-cell population with a fibrillary background arranged in a vaguely streaming pattern, wavy nuclei with mild atypia, wispy cytoplasm, rare intranuclear inclusions, and dilated vascular spaces. Some cells contained a nonrefractile granular brown pigment consistent with melanin. Also identified were calcified concentric laminations typical of psammoma bodies. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were strongly immunoreactive for S-100 protein and HMB-45. A diagnosis of psammomatous melanotic schwannoma was rendered. No stigmata of Carney's complex were identified on physical examination. The patient has declined the recommendation of surgical excision of the mass. We herein describe a case unequivocally diagnosed as psammomatous melanotic schwannoma by FNAB."
CD008686,0,10905446,0,Pain pattern in multiple vertebral hemangiomas involving non-adjacent levels: report of two cases.,Hemangioma of the bone is a benign tumor usually involving the spine and the bones of the skull and pelvis. It may be either a single lesion or part of a generalized multifocal disease. Multiple lesions involving non-adjacent vertebrae are rare. Two cases of multiple vertebral hemangiomas at non-adjacent levels with different pain patterns are presented at various stages of follow-up in order to emphasize the fact that multiple vertebral hemangiomas may present with different clinical characteristics over a long period of time. The change in the location and pattern of the initially presented pain in both patients suggested the possibility of multiple level involvement. Investigation revealed multiple hemangiomas involving three non-adjacent vertebrae in the first patient and four in the second. We stress the fact that the existence of multiple non-adjacent lesions may remain undiagnosed for a considerable period of time and may be responsible for even longer-term recurrent episodes of pain. Multifocal location of back pain in patients with a known vertebral hemangioma may be considered a relative indication for the presence of multiple non-adjacent level lesions.

CD008686,0,10875456,0,Patient perception of local anesthesia for prostate brachytherapy.,"Prostate brachytherapy is an increasingly popular treatment for early-stage prostate cancer. Until now, spinal or general anesthesia for the procedure has been the standard of care. For patient safety, patient convenience, and to limit use of operating facilities, the authors started performing implants routinely with local anesthesia. We present here an evaluation of patients' acceptance of prostate brachytherapy under local anesthesia. On arrival at our department on the morning of the procedure, the patient is brought into the simulator suite, an intravenous line is started, and a urinary catheter is inserted. With the patient in the lithotomy position, a 5-by-5-cm patch of perineal skin and subcutaneous tissue is anesthetized by local infiltration of 10 mL of 1% lidocaine, using a 25-gauge 5/8-inch needle. Immediately following injection into the subcutaneous tissues, the deeper tissues, including the pelvic floor and prostate apex, are anesthetized by injecting 15 mL lidocaine solution with approximately 8 passes of a 20-gauge 1-inch needle. Following subcutaneous and periapical lidocaine injections, the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe is positioned to reproduce the planning images and a 3.5- or 6-inch, 22-gauge spinal needle is inserted into the peripheral planned needle tracks, monitored by TRUS. When the tips of the needles reach the prostatic base, about 1 mL of lidocaine solution is injected in the intraprostatic track, as the needle is slowly withdrawn. The lidocaine infiltration procedure takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Seed implantation is then performed as previously described. At the time of this report preparation, 58 of the 71 patients (81%) were interviewed, with a median follow-up of 6 months since the implant procedure. On a scale of 1 to 10, the median biopsy pain score was 4.5 compared with a median pain score with the implant procedure of 3.0. There was no clear correlation between the two scores (r = .26). There was no correlation between patients' implant pain score and the number of implant needles used, the pre-implant prostate size, or patient age. The prostate radiation dose coverage, calculated as the percent of the post-implant volume covered by the prescription isodose, averaged 88% (range, 75% to 99%). Five of the 55 patients interviewed (9%) stated that they would have preferred to have the procedure under general anesthesia. Ranked on a 1 to 5 scale, the median patient satisfaction was 5 and the average was 4.4. The substitution of local anesthesia has facilitated rapid introduction of a high-volume brachytherapy program at an institution, without requiring the allocation of significant operating room time. We are pleased with the overall level of patient comfort and satisfaction."
CD008686,0,10863042,0,Human chromaffin cell graft into the CSF for cancer pain management: a prospective phase II clinical study.,"A number of pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the value of adrenal medullary allografts in the management of chronic pain. The present longitudinal survey studied 15 patients transplanted for intractable cancer pain after failure of systemic opioids due to the persistence of undesirable side-effects. Before inclusion, all the patients had their pain controlled by daily intrathecal (I-Th) morphine administration. The main evaluation criteria of analgesic activity of the chromaffin cell allograft was the complementary requirement of analgesics and in particular the consumption of I-Th morphine required to maintain effective pain control. Out of the 12 patients who profited from enhanced analgesia with long-term follow-up (average 4.5 months), five no longer required the I-Th morphine (with prolonged interruption of systemic opioids as well), two durably decreased I-Th morphine intake and five were stabilized until the end of their follow-up. Durable decline and stabilization were interpreted as indicative of analgesic activity by comparison with the usual dose escalation observed during disease progression. In most cases, we noted a relationship between analgesic responses and CSF met-enkephalin levels. The results of this phase II open study demonstrate the feasibility and the safety of this approach using chromaffin cell grafts for long-term relief of intractable cancer pain. However, while analgesic efficacy was indicated by the reduction or stabilization in complementary opioid intake, these observations will need to be confirmed in a controlled trial in a larger series of patients."

CD008686,0,10854529,0,Radiation-induced apoptosis: predictive and therapeutic significance in radiotherapy of prostate cancer (review).,"Current therapy for advanced prostate cancer is hampered by the propensity of the disease to progress from an androgen-dependent state to an androgen-independent state. Current treatment for advanced disease is palliative. Therefore, the therapeutic goal for prostate cancer treatment today is to arrest the disease at an early state when it is still localized to the gland. The standard treatment for clinically localized disease is radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy by way of external beam irradiation or local radioactive seed implants (brachytherapy). In advanced disease, the use of radiation therapy is limited to palliation of pain secondary to bone metastases and for spinal cord compression. Tracking residual disease and predicting outcome is limited to following the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) production, evaluating for bone or solid organ metastasis, and analyzing their preoperative clinical stage, PSA and Gleason's score. Apoptosis as a molecular process of genetically regulated cell death has a critical endpoint that coincides with the goal of successful treatment of human malignancies. Since in cancer treatment the therapeutic goal is to trigger tumor-selective cell death, activation of the apoptotic pathway in prostatic tumor cells offers attractive and potentially effective therapeutic targets. As our understanding of the vital role of apoptosis in the development and growth of the prostate gland has expanded, numerous genes that encode apoptotic regulators have been identified that are severely impaired in prostate tumors. Human prostate cancer cells undergo apoptosis in response to androgen ablation, chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing irradiation. The expression of apoptotic modulators within individual prostate tumors appears to correlate with the cancer cell's sensitivity to traditional therapeutic modalities, including radiotherapy. No strict correlation between radiation-induced apoptosis and longevity of prostate cancer patients has emerged, possibly because the ability to achieve an initial remission alone does not adequately predict long-term outcome and patient survival. In this review we summarize the current understanding of the effects of radiation therapy on prostatic tumor cells within the context of the therapeutic significance of radiation-induced apoptosis in the effective elimination of androgen independent prostate cancer cells. As we enter a new millenium, identification of distinct molecular markers predictive of therapeutic response of prostatic tumors to radiation therapy may afford alternative prognostic indicators in optimizing our treatment protocols for advanced disease."
CD008686,0,10853892,0,Solitary osseous hemangioma outside the spinal and craniofacial bones.,"Bone hemangioma is mainly seen in the skull and spine, and rarely occurs in other bones. We report herein four cases of osseous hemangioma arising in rare sites: In two cases, on a rib; a faintly painful mass in one case located on the scapula; and progressive pain in one case located on the ischium. The tumors presented clinically as incidental lesions on radiographs. All cases had an aggressive appearance, such as defect of the cortex, a soft-tissue mass, and a sunburst-like appearance. Markedly high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images was a characteristic finding. Open biopsy resulted in severe blood loss, but needle biopsy was performed safely under computed tomography guidance. It is important to note that bone hemangiomas may be misdiagnosed as malignant tumors."
CD008686,0,10853117,0,Efficacy of transverse tripolar stimulation for relief of chronic low back pain: results of a single center.,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the transverse tripolar spinal cord stimulation system (TTS) in providing relief of low back pain in patients with chronic non-malignant pain. Transverse tripolar electrodes were implanted in the lower thoracic region (T(8-9) to T(12)-L(1)) in 10 patients with chronic neuropathic pain, all of whom reported a significant component of low back pain in combination with unilateral or bilateral leg pain. One patient reported inadequate pain relief during the trial and was not implanted with a permanent generator. A visual analogue scale of low back pain showed a nonsignificant decrease from 64 +/- 19 to 47 +/- 30 (p = 0.25; paired t test) after 1 month of stimulation. Similarly, functional disability evaluated using Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire was not improved (p = 0. 46; paired t test). We conclude that chronic low back pain is not particularly responsive to the transverse stimulation provided by the TTS system."

She had a six year history of pain in the neck region. She suffered from limited neck movement, accentuation of pain during the night, but distinctive salicylate pain relief.

CD008686,0,10835123,0,Metal artifact reduction sequence: early clinical applications.,"Artifact arising from metal hardware remains a significant problem in orthopedic magnetic resonance imaging. The metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS) reduces the size and intensity of susceptibility artifacts from magnetic field distortion. The sequence, which is based on view angle tilting in combination with increased gradient strength, can be conveniently used in conjunction with any spin-echo sequence and requires no additional imaging time. In patients with persistent pain after femoral neck fracture, the MARS technique allows visualization of marrow adjacent to hip screws, thus enabling diagnosis or exclusion of avascular necrosis. Other applications in the hip include assessment of periprosthetic soft tissues after hip joint replacement surgery, postoperative assessment after resection of bone tumors and reconstruction, and localization of unopacified methyl methacrylate cement prior to hip arthroplasty revision surgery. In the knee, the MARS technique allows visualization of structures adjacent to implanted metal staples, pins, or screws. The technique can significantly improve visualization of periprosthetic bone and soft-tissue structures even in patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty. In patients with spinal fixation hardware, the MARS technique frequently allows visualization of the vertebral bodies and spinal canal contents. The technique can be helpful after wrist fusion or screw fixation of scaphoid fractures."
CD008686,0,10825114,0,Early results of isoelastic hemiarthroplasty in chronic shoulder arthritis.,"Fourteen isoelastic shoulder hemiarthroplasties were studied in patients with shoulder pain due to chronic rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis unresponsive to conservative means. The average follow-up was 27 months (range: 12-46 months) and the average patient age was 66.4 years (range: 54-79 years). A Constant shoulder score was used to assess results. Pain relief was obtained in 85.7% of patients. Function scores averaged 8 preoperatively and 13 postoperatively. Subjectively, 12 patients improved. Average gain was 33 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of flexion, and 21 degrees of external rotation. Internal rotation improved by two levels on the spine. Total shoulder scores improved from an average of 42 points preoperatively to 78 points postoperatively. There was 1 complication of immediate postoperative dislocation. Early results with isoelastic (polyacetyl resin) shoulder hemiarthroplasty are encouraging. The prosthesis is inexpensive and easy to use, requires minimal bone resection, involves cementless fixation, and has established results in tumor surgery. Its long-term value for chronic arthritis will be reported as part of an ongoing prospective study."
CD008686,0,10824285,0,Proinflammatory pathways in cervicogenic headache.,"Cervicogenic headache (CEH) is a relatively common form of headache arising from the neck structures. The pathophysiology probably results from various local pain-producing factors such as intervertebral dysfunction, with a no less important role played by the frequent coexistence of a history of head traumas. This report represents a series of pathophysiological studies in CEH patients and the results achieved by pharmacological treatment of the disease. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha) exert their multifunctional biological effects by promoting and increasing the molecular events of cellular inflammation. We found that the cytokine pattern of CEH patients is--similar to cluster headache--biased towards an inflammatory status. Higher levels of both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha were detected in the sera of CEH patients than the levels in patients with migraine without aura and in healthy subjects. There were also differences between the spontaneous and mechanically worsened pain phases of CEH. Nitric oxide (NO) synthase is also activated in cervicogenic headache. No change in NO metabolites levels has been observed after NO donor administration. This behaviour is clearly different from that observed in migraine and tension headache patients. We conclude that the high degree of cytokine and NO production in CH may depend on the differing pathophysiological mechanisms at work in CEH than in other forms of headache."
CD008686,0,10821903,0,PMMA cementoplasty in symptomatic metastatic lesions of the S1 vertebral body.,"We describe a lateral transiliac direct puncture approach to the S1 vertebral body for polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cementoplasty of painful metastatic lesions. This approach was performed using a 15-cm-long trocar needle with 3-mm outer diameter, introduced under general anesthesia and fluoroscopic control. A lateral projection was used to center the needle just in front of the spinal canal and subjacent to the superior plate of the S1 vertebral body. Needle progression was controlled using anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic projections alternately with a needle course parallel to an axial plane, avoiding conflict with the S1 foramen. After needle tip placement in the center of the S1 vertebral body, diluted PMMA with a setting time of 8 min was delivered. Ipsilateral lesions of the lateral sacral compartment were filled with the same needle by stepwise withdrawal and continuous PMMA injection."

CD008686,0,10817486,0,Multiple symmetric lipomatosis: an unusual cause of childhood obesity and mental retardation.,"Multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL), also known as Launois-Bensaude syndrome or Madelung's disease, is a rare disorder predominantly seen in middle-aged male patients. The disorder is characterized by large subcutaneous fat masses distributed around the neck, shoulders, and other parts of the trunk, often associated with nervous system abnormalities. A close relationship to alcoholism, metabolic disturbances and malignant tumours has been observed. Until now, MSL has only been described in adults. We report on the first two children, a 9-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy, with the characteristic clinical findings of MSL. The girl presented with severe obesity, developmental delay, mild mental retardation, peripheral neuropathy, and latent hypothyroidism. In addition, she had elevated lactate concentrations in blood and cerebral spinal fluid suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Biochemical analyses of muscle showed a respiratory chain complex II deficiency. The boy suffered from severe obesity, mild mental retardation and insulin resistant diabetes mellitus. In both children, analyses of the mitochondrial genome did not reveal major deletions nor the MERRF 8344 point mutation. MSL seems to be a new neurometabolic disorder with heterogeneous clinical expression whose pathogenesis is still unknown."

A generalized tonic-clonic seizure occurred a few minutes after injection of the morphine antagonist naloxone. No cerebral lesion was detected. This observation supports the notion of a possible pro-epileptogenic effect of opioid substances in association with metabolic and other toxic factors. Various hypotheses as to the complex actions of morphine and its antagonist in epileptogenesis are discussed.

CD008686,0,10778733,0,Clinical trial of intrathecal administration of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine for treatment of meningeal dissemination of malignant tumors.,"Intrathecal administration of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) was performed in patients with meningeal dissemination of malignant tumors during the period from January 1996 to September 1998, and they were followed up until February 1999. The study population consisted of 23 patients: 12 with lung cancer, 4 with breast cancer, 2 with colon cancer, 1 with malignant lymphoma, 2 with glioblastoma and 2 with metastatic brain tumors of unknown origin. FdUrd was administered intrathecally through an Ommaya reservoir placed in the lateral ventricle initially at a dose of 1 microg twice per week, and the dose was increased to 10 microg and administration schedule was also increased every day. Headache and nuchal pain were relieved in all patients regardless of responsiveness to intrathecal FdUrd therapy as determined from the findings in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Patients showed no side effects during the course of intrathecal chemotherapy except for slight nausea in two patients and dull headache in one. Sixteen of the 23 patients showed decreased cell number in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Positive cytological findings in CSF became negative in 6 of the 23 patients, and the levels of CSF tumor markers were decreased in 14. Responsiveness to intrathecal administration of FdUrd was defined as 'response' when both the cell number and tumor markers were decreased in both ventricular and spinal CSF or when the cell number was decreased in cases in which the tumor markers were not detected. Overall, 16 of the 23 patients (70%) showed complete or partial responses to intrathecal FdUrd therapy as determined from CSF findings. These results demonstrated the efficacy of intrathecal FdUrd chemotherapy without apparent neurotoxicity for treatment of meningeal dissemination of malignant tumors."
CD008686,0,10774246,0,[Plasma cell leukemia presenting with circulating villous lymphocytes and an indolent clinical course].,"A 73-year-old man was admitted to our hospital in July 1996 because of lymphoctyosis and lumbago. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly and anemia. Hematologic examination showed a hemoglobin concentration of 9.6 g/dl and a leukocyte count of 32,700/microliter with 74% abnormal mononuclear cells. In Wright-Giemsa stained blood films, these cells had short villi arising from 1 or 2 poles. Immunophenotyping of peripheral mononuclear cells showed moderate to strong expression of CD10, CD24, CD38, and sIg lambda, but not of CD19, CD20, or CD25. Southern blot analysis of the peripheral mononuclear cells demonstrated rearranged monoclonal bands in the C lambda. Urine immunoelectrophoresis detected a monoclonal band identifiable as lambda-type Bence Jones protein. In addition, bone X-ray studies disclosed multiple osteolytic lesions. A diagnosis of plasma cell leukemia was made, and the patient was placed on chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide and prednisolone. No notable improvement in laboratory findings was seen but the patient experienced an indolent clinical course. He died of pneumonia in January 1998. The morphological and clinical findings were unusual for a case of plasma cell leukemia. This case study suggested that signs of lymphocytosis require immunophenotypic and electron microscopic studies for the differential diagnosis of plasma cell leukemia."
CD008686,0,10772414,0,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the prevention of colorectal cancer.,"Shortly after the discovery of prostaglandins being involved in vertebrate carcinogenesis (during the 1970s), trials in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) had shown that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could reduce the number and size of these precancerous lesions. In the late 1980s epidemiological evidence was provided that long term use of aminosalicylic acid (ASA) for various indications seemed to be protective against colonic cancer and malignancies of other sites. Controlled intervention studies with nonselective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors (i.e. traditional NSAIDs) were hampered by the risks of gastrointestinal and renal side effects. Recently, selective COX-2 receptor antagonists have been developed, improving pain and inflammation without the above mentioned adverse effects. In animal models it has been shown that COX-2 inhibitors are able to reduce colonic neoplasia and/or its proxy markers. This is the rationale for the presently ongoing testing of those drugs in hereditary and sporadic colonic adenomas."

CD008686,0,10757469,0,Langerhans cell histiocytosis and the central nervous system in childhood: evolution and prognostic factors. Results of a collaborative study.,"This retrospective study detailed clinical and radiologic involvement of the central nervous system related to Langerhans cell histiocytosis in 18 French children. We excluded cases of isolated hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction or spinal involvement. Cerebellar symptoms were the most common clinical symptoms. Two different patterns of magnetic resonance or computed tomographic images were identified: demyelination and gliosis or atrophy, described as degenerative lesions, mostly located in the cerebellum in 10 children, or tumor-like lesions occurring in any part of the brain in 13 children. Six children had both types of lesion. The clinical cerebellar syndrome correlated with the specific imaging pattern suggestive of a cerebellar degenerative lesion, which did not show any changes after treatment. As suggested by this study and previous clinical and histologic reports, it is believed that brain involvement in the course of Langerhans cell histiocytosis might arise from different disease mechanisms: primary histiocyte proliferation and secondary atrophy or demyelination and gliosis of unknown origin. Treatment consequently should be adapted to the supposed mechanism of the lesion."
CD008686,0,10750738,0,Total spondylectomy for solitary spinal metastasis of the thoracolumbar spine: a preliminary report.,"Eight cases of solitary spinal metastasis with neurological deficit in thoracolumbar spine in which total en bloc spondylectomy (TS) was performed by bisecting the affected vertebra through both pedicles using fine thread wire saws were reviewed. Patient age ranged from 40 to 78 (mean, 62) years. Primary lesions were in the lung (2), kidney (2), thyroid (3) and prostate (1). TS was performed through a posterior approach in 5 cases (T6-7, T12, L2, L2 and L2-3) and through a one-stage anterior and posterior combined approach in the others (L2, L3 and L4). The spine was reconstructed with a ceramic vertebral prosthesis and a pedicle screw fixation system in 5 cases, and with augmented anterior spinal instruments in 3 cases. There were neither surgical complications nor surgical mortality. All patients became ambulatory and pain-free after surgery. Histologically, a marginal surgical margin was achieved in only one case. The other 7 cases had intralesional margin at the osteotomized pedicles. Four patients died from causes unrelated to local recurrence 4 to 44 (mean, 19) months after surgery. Effectiveness of surgery was maintained until death in all 4 of these patients. Asymptomatic local recurrence occurred in 2 patients with renal cancer at 10 and 33 months after surgery. These preliminary results suggest that TS for solitary spinal metastasis can achieve good control of local recurrence without major complications and is clinically acceptable surgery."

CD008686,0,10750882,0,Diagnosis and management of acute low back pain.,"Acute low back pain is commonly encountered in primary care practice but the specific cause often cannot be identified. This ailment has a benign course in 90 percent of patients. Recurrences and functional limitations can be minimized with appropriate conservative management, including medications, physical therapy modalities, exercise and patient education. Radiographs and laboratory tests are generally unnecessary, except in the few patients in whom a serious cause is suspected based on a comprehensive history and physical examination. Serious causes that need to be considered include infection, malignancy, rheumatologic diseases and neurologic disorders. Patients with suspected cauda equina lesions should undergo immediate surgical investigation. Surgical evaluation is also indicated in patients with worsening neurologic deficits or intractable pain that is resistant to conservative treatment. The current recommendation is two or three days of bed rest for patients with acute radiculopathy. The treatment plan should be reassessed in patients who do not return to normal activity within four to six weeks."
CD008686,0,10746970,0,Obstructive biliary symptomatology as the first sign of HIV-infection.,"A 41-year-old white homosexual man presented with epigastric pain and jaundice. Physical examination showed enlargement of bilateral axillar and left inguinal lymph node, while ERCP and a CT scan suggested interruption of bile flow in the intrapancreatic tract of the common bile duct. An endoprosthesis was positioned in the common bile duct during the ERCP. Blood tests (both ELISA and Western blot techniques) showed positivity for anti-HIV antibodies and a CD4 count of 780/mmc (normal: 900-1,200/mmc). A few days later, a dramatic increase of the size of a lymph node in this right axilla occurred, rapidly reaching 5 cm of diameter. A biopsy was performed at this level, and histological examination revealed a high grade B-cell Burkitt type lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy was negative, as well as lumbar puncture. Aggressive chemotherapy with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, bleomycine, eldesine and prednisone, together with intratechal administration of methotrexate, was attempted. However, after a marginal and transient regression, the NHL rapidly progressed and the patient eventually died seven months after the diagnosis of NHL. A post mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma of the peripancreatic and axillar lymph nodes, with diffusion to the leptomeninges, subaracnoideal spaces and encephalus. No signs of lymphoma were detected in other nodal or extra nodal areas."
CD008686,0,10737366,0,The effect of pentoxifiline on post-injury hyperalgesia in rats and postoperative pain in patients.,"Recent studies demonstrate that activation of proinflammatory cytokines following injury intensifies the process of nociception. The present investigation assessed the influence of pre-injury pentoxifiline (PTFL, a non-specific cytokine inhibitor) on the development of post-injury nociception in animals and patients. It was established that intrathecal or intraperitoneal PTFL, elevated the nociceptive threshold for mechanical stimuli in the formalin test in rats. Pre-injury PTFL also inhibited pain-related behaviour. These findings correlate with a lower TNFalpha level in the serum of animals receiving pre-injury PTFL. In clinical investigations PTFL was administered intravenously before elective cholecystectomy. Patients who received preoperative PTFL had lower opioid requirements in the early postoperative period than control. At the same time, serum levels of TNFalpha and IL6 were lower in the PTFL group. Our results confirm the hypothesis as to the possibility of modulating of nociception through preemptive administration of a cytokine inhibitor."
CD008686,0,10726589,0,Closed spinal dysraphism: a review on diagnosis and treatment in infancy.,"This article reviews the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnostic strategies, and therapeutic management of closed spinal dysraphism in infancy. Four groups of symptoms are distinguished: (1) cutaneous abnormalities, (2) lower motor neuron dysfunction due to congenital spinal and nerve root abnormalities, (3) upper motor neuron dysfunction due to tethering of the spinal cord, and (4) symptoms caused by associated malformations. Guidelines are proposed concerning timing and type of diagnostic investigations in infancy. This essentially encompasses a neurological assessment, including spinal ultrasonography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and the brain, and a urological assessment, including ultrasonography of kidneys and bladder, cystourethrography and a urodynamic study. As to the tethered cord syndrome it is concluded that first, already in infancy, a progressive neurological dysfunction can be detected; second, surgical untethering should be performed only upon appearance of upper motor neuron signs or upon progression of lower motor neuron signs. Despite its frequently asymptomatic course, the diagnosis of a congenital lumbosacral lipoma, and in the more general sense, of a closed spinal dysraphism, implies a periodic, multidisciplinary follow-up for life."
CD008686,0,10723244,0,[Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion associated with meningeal infiltration of tumor cells and elevated interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 in cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with adult T-cell leukemia].,"A 73-year-old man with acute adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) in remission was re-admitted to our hospital due to drowsiness, headache, and bilateral knee joint pain on May 17, 1998. On admission, examinations revealed decreased serum sodium concentration (112 mEq/l), low plasma osmotic pressure (259 mOsm/l), and elevated antidiuretic hormone(5.6 pg/ml). Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed an increased number of abnormal flower-like lymphocyte (951/microliter). Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging found no abnormality in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. These findings yielded a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Though ATL patients typically exhibit a variety of clinical symptoms, SIADH is rarely one of the complications. Further investigation showed that IL-1 beta and IL-6 concentrations were increased in spinal fluid but not in serum. Recently, it has been reported that exogeneous IL-6 is an inducer of ADH secretion, and that primary ATL cells and HTLV-I infected cell lines can produce IL-6. In this case, we speculated that IL-6 produced by ATL cells that infiltrated a cerebral lesion may have played an important role in the development of SIADH."

Papyrus scrolls are the main source of information about medical activities. There are fourteen medical papyrus scrolls, in varying states of conservation, mostly corresponding to the Middle Empire, but containing references to the Ancient Empire (the period of the pyramids). These are practical treaties with little explanation of the underlying pathology (a primitive theory of the 'flow' of humors, involving the flowing of different malignant entities) within a system of magic and religion. The empirical observations referring to diseases or dysfunctions of the nervous system, although few, seem to be worth reviewing. Remedies for migraine ('the disorder affecting half the head') take up a long chapter of the only complete and best preserved Ebers papyrus.

CD008686,0,10712717,0,Use of intravenous ketamine-midazolam association for pain procedures in children with cancer. A prospective study.,"We evaluated the safety and efficacy of midazolam-ketamine association to control pain induced by diagnostic procedures in paediatric oncology patients. 226 procedures were carried out in 92 patients aged three days to 18 years. Drugs were given i.v. by an anaesthesiologist. Midazolam dose was 25 microg.kg-1 and ketamine 0. 5 to 2 mg.kg-1, depending on number and invasiveness of procedures. The mean dose of ketamine was 1 mg.kg-1. Mean duration of sedation was ten min. No complication was observed and analgesia was considered satisfactory in 89 out of 92 patients. These results indicate that midazolam-ketamine is a safe and effective association in pain management for paediatric oncology patients and efficiently induces brief unconscious sedation with analgesia."
CD008686,0,10711643,0,Melanoma metastatic to the spine: a review of 133 cases.,"Although spine metastasis from melanoma is an uncommon event, it can pose a complex management problem. The presentation and natural history of melanoma metastatic to the spine has not been described in the medical literature. We have conducted a review of the records of 133 patients with melanoma metastatic to the spine in order to obtain retrospective data on demographic information, clinical presentation, disease course and survival. Patients with cutaneous, ocular and mucosal melanoma were all represented, but those with primary cutaneous tumours of the trunk were more prevalent than expected. Other sites of metastatic disease were present in nearly all patients and metastases to other skeletal sites were not unusual. Pain was the most common presenting symptom. The radiographic diagnosis was generally made easily by plain radiographs, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, with the most frequent finding being a destructive lesion. Bone scan gave false-negative results 15% of the time. The median survival for the group was 4 months. It is concluded that melanoma metastatic to the spine represents a late event in the evolution of this illness. Palliation should be the goal of treatment, but symptom management should be individualized, bearing in mind the short anticipated survival of these patients."

CD008686,0,10698097,0,Metastatic prostate cancer (with prostate-specific antigen of 9996) presenting as obstructive jaundice.,"A 78-year-old man admitted with clinical jaundice and pelvic pain had a total bilirubin level of 6.56 mg/dL, an alkaline phosphatase level of 855 U/L, and a prostate specific antigen (PSA) level of 9996 ng/mL. A computed tomogram demonstrated marked retroperitoneal, peripancreatic, periceliac, and periaortic lymphadenopathy. A bone scan revealed increased radiolabeled technetium uptake in the pelvis, vertebral column, parietooccipital region, ribs, and appendiceal skeleton. A biopsy of one pelvic lesion revealed metastatic prostate cancer. This man's obstructive jaundice and bone pain had a dramatic response to treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (leupro lide) and antiandrogen (bicalutamide). All bone pair and clinical signs of jaundice disappeared in 1 week His total bilirubin decreased to 0.84 mg/dL by 2 weeks His PSA values reflected this clinical response, decreasing to 4022 ng/mL in 1 week, 2680 ng/dL after 2 weeks and 1028 ng/mL after 1 month of the above therapy."

Changes in gait or the onset of limb pain without a discernible local cause are indications for investigation of patients for possible intraspinal pathology.

Initial reports of intrathecal administration of ziconotide in cancer and AIDS patients whose pain was unrelieved with opioids demonstrated analgesic efficacy. Although adverse effects were reported, these appeared to be easily managed through dose reduction or symptomatic treatment. This clinical report describes the experiences of three patients with serious adverse effects associated with intrathecal ziconotide."
CD008686,0,10692601,0,Immunolocalization of SNS/PN3 and NaN/SNS2 sodium channels in human pain states.,"The tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) voltage-gated sodium channel SNS/PN3 and the newly discovered NaN/SNS2 are expressed in sensory neurones, particularly in nociceptors. Using specific antibodies, we have studied, for the first time in humans, the presence of SNS/PN3 and NaN/SNS2 in peripheral nerves, including tissues from patients with chronic neurogenic pain. In brachial plexus injury patients, there was an acute decrease of SNS/PN3- and NaN/SNS2-like immunoreactivity in sensory cell bodies of cervical dorsal root ganglia (DRG) whose central axons had been avulsed from spinal cord, with gradual return of the immunoreactivity to control levels over months. In contrast, there was increased intensity of immunoreactivity to both channels in some peripheral nerve fibers just proximal to the site of injury in brachial plexus trunks, and in neuromas. These findings suggest that the expression of these sodium channels in neuronal cell bodies is reduced after spinal cord root avulsion injury in man, but that pre-synthesized channel proteins may undergo translocation with accumulation at sites of nerve injury, as in animal models of peripheral axotomy. The latter may contribute to positive symptoms, as our patients all showed a positive Tinel's sign. Nerve terminals in distal limb neuromas and skin from patients with chronic local hyperalgesia and allodynia all showed marked increases of SNS/PN3-immunoreactive fibers, but little or no NaN/SNS2-immunoreactivity, suggesting that the former may be related to the persistent hypersensitive state. Axonal immunoreactivity to both channels was similar to control nerves in sural nerve biopsies in a selection of neuropathies, irrespective of nerve inflammation, demyelination or spontaneous pain, including a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain. Our studies suggest that the best target for SNS/PN3 blocking agents is likely to be chronic local hypersensitivity."
CD008686,0,10687324,0,The safety and efficacy of a single dose (500 mg or 1 g) of intravenous magnesium sulfate in neuropathic pain poorly responsive to strong opioid analgesics in patients with cancer.,"Neuropathic pain may respond poorly to morphine and is often difficult to relieve. Recent attention has been drawn to the role of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in the potentiation of neuropathic pain. Magnesium is known to block the NMDA receptor. It reduces the neuropathic pain response in animals, and attenuates postoperative pain and migraine in humans. We have examined the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of two intravenous doses of magnesium sulfate in 12 patients with neuropathic pain due to malignant infiltration of the brachial or lumbosacral plexus. The first six patients received 500 mg, the remainder 1 g. Apart from a mild feeling of warmth at the time of the injection, both doses were well tolerated. After receiving 500 mg, three patients experienced complete pain relief and two experienced partial pain relief for up to 4 hours duration; pain was unchanged in one patient. After receiving 1 g, one patient experienced complete relief and four experienced partial pain relief of similar duration; pain was unchanged in one patient. Intravenous magnesium sulfate in these doses appears to be safe and well tolerated. A useful analgesic effect may be obtained in some patients and further evaluation is warranted."

All the patients were complaint about pain at right or left lumbar area and microscopic or gross haematuria. The clinical examination did not confirm any pathologic finding. The ultrasonographic and CT scan investigation of the patients revealed a renal mass. Under the frozen section diagnosis of malignant tumor in two cases and the cytological diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma in the third case, a radical nephrectomy was performed. In all the cases the pathological diagnosis was renal leiomyosarcoma. Because of the rarity of this neoplasm, the literature is reviewed, presenting the symptoms, the radiological findings, the diagnostic criteria and the differential diagnosis of the tumor. Radical nephrectomy remains the treatment of choice for this tumor, which exhibits an aggressive biological behavior and an unfavorable prognosis."
CD008686,0,10670268,0,[Headache caused by endocranial hypotension secondary to sacrococcygeal trauma in a patient with a congenital arachnoid cyst].,"Headache caused by intracranial hypotension after sacrococcygeal trauma, is a rare syndrome with very similar symptoms and physiopathology to post dural puncture headache. In both situations, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks through a dural tear, leading to a decrease in its pressure. A 13 year old patient presented a frontal and occipital positional headache, after undergoing sacrococcygeal trauma. In magnetic resonance images, the presence of a spinal arachnoid diverticulum (cyst) and CSF leak were confirmed. After the establishment of conservative medical treatment, complete clinical remission was observed. The diagnosis of intracranial hypotension headache syndrome is mainly clinical, once other possible headache etiologies have been discarded. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to detect small CSF leaks, and in this case, magnetic resonance imaging clearly showed the existence of an arachnoid cyst. The presence of some meningeal diverticulums such as arachnoid cyst, constitute a risk to undergo this syndrome, due to the possibility of its rupture by minor traumatisms. The initial treatment should be conservative, as the dural tear seals spontaneously and the liquid is reabsorbed."
CD008686,0,10668779,0,Catecholamine-induced hypertension in lumbosacral paraplegia: five case reports.,"Hypertension in the patient with SCI is relatively rare and generally restricted to patients with high-level injuries where autonomic dysreflexia can occur. Resting blood pressure in individuals with SCI has been described as lower than that in the normal population. This report describes five previously normotensive teenagers with subsequent paraplegia as a result of gunshot wounds who presented with hypertension secondary to idiopathic elevation of plasma or urinary catecholamine levels. A clonidine suppression test was used as a neuroprobe to inhibit centrally mediated sympathetic outflow, excluding the probability of an extra-axial autonomous catecholamine-secreting tumor as the possible source of hypertension. Positive suppression was achieved in four patients (41%, 37.2%, 4.8%, and 37.2% decreases). One patient had values corresponding to orthostatic changes (an increase of 63%) because of poor compliance with the test. This patient was lost to follow-up; in the remaining four, hypertension resolved at 12, 8, 9, and 6 weeks postinjury. The increased circulating catecholamine level appears to be promoted by a centrally mediated response to the SCI. Elevated blood pressure probably results from an upgraded receptor regulation or an increased receptor sensitivity on the affected cells in the absence of restraining spinal reflexes. The pathophysiology of such hypertension seems to be secondary to autonomic dysfunction and, although it may be transient, it should be treated promptly and reevaluated periodically until stabilization is achieved."
CD008686,0,10663814,0,Preemptive analgesia with tramadol and fentanyl in pediatric neurosurgery.,"Preemptive analgesia is based on administration of an analgesic before a painful stimulus generates, so as to prevent the subsequent rebound mechanism. Tissue injury results in disruption of the processing mechanisms of noxious stimuli afferent to the CNS (central nervous system) by way of an increase of inputs in the spinal cord. These reactions may be reduced by the administration of opioids. Few studies on preemptive analgesia with opioids in children are available, and none of them is concerned with pediatric neurosurgery. Tramadol and fentanyl are synthetic opioids which are relatively new and act through the activation of pain-inhibitory mechanisms. We conducted a randomized, prospective trial on the preemptive effects in children of these two analgesic drugs, administered according to three different protocols: tramadol as a bolus (1 mg/kg); tramadol by continuous infusion (150 microg/kg per h); fentanyl by continuous infusion (2 microg/kg per h). In all, 42 children undergoing major neurosurgical operations were enrolled in the study, 14 in each treatment group. Each treatment was started at the induction of general anesthesia and continued throughout the entire duration of the operation. The postoperative pain evaluation was conducted in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at the end of the surgical operations and involved comparison of any changes in behavioral (AFS scale and CHEOPS score) and hemodynamic (heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, oxygen saturation, O(2) and CO(2) partial pressure) parameters. Only 2 children, both in group A, needed further drug administration postoperatively. No significant side effects were noticed in any of the three groups, except that in group A there was a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting. Tramadol efficacy seems to be better when it is administered in continuous infusion; this treatment modality also leads to fewer adverse effects. Fentanyl, in contrast, proved to be superior to tramadol in the treatment of postoperative pain. In conclusion, preemptive analgesia is a valid technique for the treatment of acute pain in children undergoing major neurosurgical operations."
CD008686,0,10663195,0,[Prolonged peridural analgesia (PDA) for postoperative pain therapy after major urologic interventions. Experiences with 172 adult patients].,"The benefits of epidural analgesia are well known, but it is not well understood which types of urologic surgery benefit most from epidural analgesia. In this study, the effects and side effects of prolonged epidural analgesia are prospectively examined and analysed on 172 adult patients in three different operation groups. An epidural infusion of local anaesthetic combined with an opioid and adrenaline was given for a period of 5-7 days. There was no difference between the groups with respect to the effectiveness of the analgesia and patients' perception of the treatment. Mobilization differed, as expected, between the groups, however even after the most major surgery (e. g. cystectomy with bladder substitution), mobilization was impressively unproblematic. Retarded return of regular intestinal function after the transperitoneal operation and partly after lumbotomy compared with the extraperitoneal operation depended on which operation was performed and the amount of analgesia given. The side effects such as sedation, nausea and pruritus were conditional partly on the opiate and partly on the intervention. Up to 11 % showed slight muscular weakness of the lower limbs as a specific side effect of the local anaesthetic."
CD008686,0,10655740,0,[A case of pituitary apoplexy approving as severe headache and nausea].,"The causes of pituitary apoplexy are unclear. We report a case of pituitary apoplexy presenting with headache and nausea. On June 17th, 1997 a 74-year-old woman had complained of retro-orbital headache, fever and vomiting. A cold was diagnosed for which she recurred medication. In addition to the previous symptoms she was getting to lose appetite. She was admitted to our hospital for further examination and treatment on June 21. On admission neurological examination showed left pupil mydriasis, the left eye had no light reflex and the right eye had only a slight response to the light. She could hardly move both eyeballs up. Laboratory data showed a normal white blood cell count and the CRP was 16.2 mg/dl. Lumbar puncture showed 97 mg/dl total protein and 82 cells per microliter, most of which were lymphocytes. We diagnosed viral infection based on the evidence of clinical symptoms and lumbar puncture data. The patient was treated with gamma-globulin and improved. From the 16th day of sickness we recognized symptoms of oculomotor paralysis and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. On the 23rd day of sickness we strongly suspected pituitary apoplexy based on transaxial MR images. After absorption of intra-tumor hemorrhage, the oculomotor symptoms recurred. We finally reached a diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy based on pathological material, MR images, symptoms and laboratory data. We must think of pituitary apoplexy when we see an aged out-patient with severe headache, nausea, vomiting and oculomotor paralysis. It was difficult to diagnose this disease in the early time course of the disease."
CD008686,0,10633814,0,[Renal cancer in adults. Review of 68 cases].,"The authors report a series of 68 cases of renal cancer observed over a 9-year period. Patients consisted of 33 women (49%) and 35 men (51%), with a mean age of 53 years (range: 23-85 years). The clinical features were polymorphic, dominated by loin pain (44%), haematuria (37%), a lumbar mass (19%), alteration of the general state (7%). The diagnosis was established by ultrasonography in 59 patients and CT-scan in 63 patients. The mean tumour diameter was 11 cm (4-22 cm) and two cases presented bilateral tumours. The time to diagnosis ranged from 1 month to 7 years. Staging reflected the advanced stage of the cancer. Treatment was surgical for 58 patients (58%). A lumbar incision was performed, in 40% of cases. Radical nephrectomy was performed in 82%, and partial nephrectomy was performed in 3% of patients. Histological examination of the specimen showed renal cell carcinoma in 75% of cases. The lymph nodes removed were invaded in 20% of cases. The mean follow-up was 29 months (6 to 84 months), normal at one year for 44 patients (86%) and at 5 years for 16 patients (31%). Tumour recurrence in the renal compartment was observed in 2 patients (4%). Asynchronous metastases occurred in 11 patients (21.5%) after 21 months. (range: 12-48 months).

CD008686,0,10601673,0,Relative potency of epidural to intrathecal clonidine differs between acute thermal pain and capsaicin-induced allodynia.,"Clonidine is approved in the US for epidural administration in the treatment of intractable neuropathic cancer pain, but is also administered intrathecally for this indication and both epidurally and intrathecally in the treatment of acute, postoperative pain. The purpose of the current study was to estimate the relative potency of clonidine by epidural and intrathecal routes in the treatment of capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia as a model of central hypersensitivity and of noxious heat as a model of acute pain. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either intrathecal clonidine (75, 150, or 300 micrograms) or epidural clonidine (150, 300, or 600 micrograms) and rated pain from a Peltier-controlled thermode at a lumbar, thoracic, and cervical dermatomal site before and after drug administration. In addition, they rated pain from intradermal capsaicin injections at a lumbar dermatome before and 60 min after clonidine injection and described areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia to mechanical stimuli. Clonidine's effect differed with route of administration and modality of sensory testing. For acute thermal pain, intrathecal clonidine produced a dose-dependent analgesia with a lumbar>thoracic>cervical gradient, whereas only one dose of epidural clonidine reduced thermal pain and this was at the thoracic testing site. In contrast, the potency of clonidine to reduce capsaicin-induced allodynia was similar between the two routes of injection, and for hyperalgesia, clonidine was only slightly more potent after intrathecal than epidural injection. These data support clinical studies from non-comparative trials and suggest there is a >6-fold potency ratio of intrathecal:epidural administration of clonidine for acute pain, but a <2-fold potency ratio for these routes for mechanical hypersensitivity."

CD008686,0,10595674,0,Cauda equina syndrome due to lumbosacral arachnoid cysts in children.,"We describe the clinical, neuroradiological and surgical aspects of two children in whom symptoms attributable to cauda equina compression were caused by spinal arachnoid cysts. The first patient presented with recurrent urinary tract infections due to neurogenic bladder dysfunction, absent deep tendon reflexes and sensory deficit in the lower limbs. The second child presented with unstable gait as a result of weakness and diminished sensation in the lower extremities. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lumbosacral arachnoid cyst in both patients. During surgery the cysts were identified and excised. Two years after surgery, the sensory deficits of the first patient have disappeared and patellar and ankle reflexes can be elicited, but there is no improvement in bladder function. Neurological examination of the second patient was normal. We conclude that the diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome should prompt a vigorous search for its aetiology. Lumbosacral arachnoid cysts are a rare cause of cauda equina syndrome in children."

Pericallosal lipoma was indicated by MRI taken during treatment. On December 30, 1998, the patient fell from steps and struck his forehead hard, and then limb palsy occurred. He was emergently brought to our hospital. Under the suspected diagnosis of traumatic cervical spinal cord injury, preventive therapy was performed to observe the clinical course in which paralysis gradually improved. On January 22, 1999, however, he died of cardiopulmonary arrest due to sudden suffocation. In general, the connection of choroid plexus lipoma and pericallosal lipoma is bilateral in most cases. In our patients, MRI suggested that a connection with cerebral ventricles through choroidal fissure existed with no right and left difference, however, autopsy findings revealed that the lipoma existed along the left cerebral arch with obvious connection only with the left choroid plexus. The present case seemed to be a very rare case."
CD008686,0,10586256,0,Nerve conduction abnormalities and neuromyotonia in genetically engineered mouse models of human hereditary neuropathies.,"We performed electrophysiological studies in myelin protein mutant mice in order to characterize nerve conduction changes. We performed neurographic studies on the facial and sciatic nerves and needle electromyography (EMG). Mice homozygously deficient for the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (Pmp22-/-) exhibited increased motor latencies, reduced nerve conduction velocities, and polyphasia of the M-response, which are the typical electrophysiological signs of dysmyelination. PMP22 +/- mice developed only mild conduction slowing at an old age and a mild reduction of the M-amplitude, which indicates mild axonal dysfunction. Mice overexpressing Pmp22 developed severe electrophysiological signs of dysmyelination. In myelin protein zero-deficient mice (P0 -/-), we found alterations similar to those found in Pmp22 -/- mice, whereas P0 +/- mice developed mildly increased sciatic nerve F-wave latencies only late in life, which indicates only mild dysmyelination. Connexin 32-deficient mice showed electrophysiological evidence of mild axonal damage. By EMG, we found the clinical and electrophysiological signs of neuromyotonia, that is, continuous spontaneous motor unit discharges, often in rhythmic patterns (myokymia), in P0 -/-, Pmp22 -/-, Trembler, Trembler-J, and Pmp22-overexpressing mice. This indicates abnormal impulse generation in these dysmyelinated nerves. In summary, our studies demonstrate nerve conduction changes in mice with myelin protein gene defects that are similar to those found in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorders. In addition, we identified new mouse models of hereditary neuromyotonia."

Pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed, based on: (1) blood gas analysis findings of hypoxemia and (2) defective images in both of the upper lobes on urgent pulmonary blood flow scintigram. Her clinical status improved with urgent thrombolytic therapy (with tisokinase and urokinase) and anticoagulation therapy (with heparin and warfarin), and her life was saved. When pulmonary thromboembolism occurs, early diagnosis by pulmonary blood flow scintigram and early thrombolytic and anticoagulative therapies are necessary. Special attention should be paid to symptoms of pulmonary thromboembolism in patients after spinal surgery."
CD008686,0,10536726,0,Punctate midline myelotomy. A new approach in the management of visceral pain.,"Nauta et al. reported on a successful punctate midline myelotomy (PMM) for the treatment of intractable pelvic pain. The authors describe an other case history of a patient with multiple anaplastic carcinomas of the small intestine, peritoneal carcinosis and retroperitoneal lymphomas, suffering from severe visceral pain in the hypo-, meso-, and epigastrium. Nauta's PMM was successfully performed at the Th4 level. Narcotic medication was tapered from 30 mg i.v. morphine per hour pre-operatively to 5 mg per hour within 5 days postoperatively. Intensity of pain decreased from 10 to 2-3 on the visual analog scale. Only minor transient side effects appeared and the patient was discharged 5 days postoperatively. The pain reduction was maintained until the patient died from the extended disease five weeks later. We conclude that punctate midline myelotomy sufficiently controls not only pelvic visceral pain, but also visceral pain generated in the meso- and epigastrium. The findings support the concept of a midline dorsal column visceral pain pathway."
CD008686,0,10533411,0,[Medullary compression in metastatic cancer].,"Cancer patients with spinal cord compression may develop irreversible neurological deficit. The clinical picture implies back pain and subsequent neurological deficit. There is always a danger of rapid deterioration of the patient's condition. If spinal cord compression is suspected, the case is an emergency. MRI should be preferred in the diagnostic work-up, and corticosteroids be administered promptly. Radiation therapy or surgical treatment should be started as soon as possible. Patient outcome is related to the degree of neurological deficit at the start of treatment."
CD008686,0,10528893,0,Maintenance therapy and supportive care for patients with multiple myeloma.,"Although multiple myeloma remains incurable, several drug therapies are valuable in the management of patients suffering from this condition. Interferon-alpha2b and prednisone are two agents that have been shown to modestly prolong disease-free survival when each is used as monotherapy and when used in combination. Bone resorption and anemia are among several complications that adversely affect health and quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma. Bone resorption leads to skeletal complications, such as pathologic fractures, pain, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. Bisphosphonates are specific inhibitors of osteoclastic activity that can be used to treat bone resorption. Intravenous pamidronate is effective in preventing skeletal complications and also may exert a direct inhibitory effect on myeloma cells. Exogenous epoetin alfa is helpful in treating more than half of patients with anemia during the plateau state of multiple myeloma. Overall, the management of patients with multiple myeloma is complex and should focus on the treatment of the disease process and the associated complications."
CD008686,0,10525980,0,Spinal epidural abscess complicating chronic epidural analgesia in 11 cancer patients: clinical findings and magnetic resonance imaging.,"We reviewed the records of all patients who had received an epidural catheter for management of chronic cancer pain in a 3-year period (1993-1996). Patients with nervous system infections were identified, and pertinent clinical, radiological (magnetic resonance imaging), and bacteriological data were analyzed. We identified 11 patients who developed spinal epidural abscess (SEA). All of these had back pain; radicular signs occurred in seven patients and spinal cord compression in two patients. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed SEA in all 11 patients. SEA was iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images relative to spinal cord. After gadolinium administration seven lesions showed characteristic rim enhancement while three showed minimal enhancement. No signs of diskitis or osteomyelitis were present, and the abscess was always localized to the posterior epidural space. Cultures were positive in all cases and revealed Staphylococcus epidermidis in eight and S. aureus in three. All patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics, and four had an additional decompressive laminectomy. Two patients died within 1 week of diagnosis from overwhelming septicemia despite apparently adequate antibiotic treatment. Within 4 weeks after diagnosis of SEA two patients died from widely metastatic disease, although infection may have contributed. One patient developed septicemia while receiving appropriate antibiotics and underwent emergency laminectomy. The neurological deficits recovered in all patients who survived the acute infectious episode. We conclude that patients with chronic epidural catheters for cancer pain require prompt neurological evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging when SEA is suspected. Early evaluation and treatment may lead to full recovery."

The incidence of osteomas is as follows: frontal, ethmoid and maxillary, while they are extremely rare in the sphenoid sinus (2). Most often they are localized on sutures, and extremely rarely on occipital squama (3). They are often asymptomatic, and can be accidentally detected, by radiographic examination (4). The main clinical symptom is headache of varying intensity and quality, and in most cases not proportional to the size of the osteoma, which ranges from the size of pepper bean to the size of a child's head (5). In addition to headache, there can be sensitivity to pressure in the region of the frontal sinus (6). On exteriorization they give the symptomatology of the organ on which they develop. Depending on the direction of osteoma exteriorization, various complications may occur (6,7,8,9,10)."
CD008686,0,10518396,0,[Reactivation of herpes zoster infection by varicella-zoster virus].,"There has been considerable interest in varicella-zoster virus in the middle of the twentieth century. Virus isolation in 1958 had made it possible to find out the complete DNA sequence of the varicella-zoster virus. Molecular identify of the causative agents of varicella and shingles had been proved. ETIOPATHOGENESIS AND HISTOPATHOLOGY: Varicella-zoster virus is a member of the Herpesviridae family. After primary infection which results in varicella, the virus becomes latent in the cerebral or posterior root ganglia. Some of these individuals develop shingles after several decades because of virus reactivation. It is caused by decline of cellular immune response. Circumstances such as old age, hard work, using of steroids or malignancies contribute to the appearance of shingles. Histopathological findings include degenerative changes of epithelial cells such as ballooning, multinucleated giant cells and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions."

She had a history of chronic low back pain problems for which, 26 months earlier, she had an intrathecal infusion pump permanently placed for pain and spasm control. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed a mass at the site of the tip of the intrathecal catheter with high grade spinal cord compression at the level of L-1. At surgical laminectomy the compressing lesion was found to be a reactive tissue fibroma. As more patients receive these devices the physician should consider cord compression syndrome in patients presenting with symptoms of increasing low back pain, anesthesia and progressive proprioceptive loss."

CD008686,0,10488368,0,[Tingling in the hands].,"Four patients whose most prominent complaint was tingling in the hands are presented. In the first patient, a 33-year-old man, the cause appeared to be a traumatic cervical myelomalacia caused by a rear end collision three years before. The second patient, a 34-year-old woman, initially only had tingling in the hands but eventually developed paresis of the right arm and leg. MRI followed by surgery revealed a centrally located ependymoma. The third patient had a cervical disc protrusion to the left at CVI-CVII. This 49-year-old man recovered after rest and physical therapy. The last patient, a 23-year-old woman, had tingling in the ulnar area of the left hand. This appeared to be caused by an avulsion of the medial epicondyle of the humerus, the result of a trauma 10 years before. After extirpation of the epicondyle the complaints disappeared. In patients with paraesthesias it is very important to take the history meticulously and to perform thorough neurological examination. A simple neuroanatomical scheme may be used to interpret the somatosensory findings."
CD008686,0,10483833,0,The use of titanium surgical mesh-bone graft composite in the anterior thoracic or lumbar spine after complete or partial corpectomy.,"Various conditions such as fracture, dislocation, tumor, or infection adversely affect the vertebral body and lead to instability. Restoration of a stable anterior column is essential for normal spinal biomechanics. Various biological and mechanical spacers have been used to reconstruct the anterior column after corpectomy. In this retrospective review, the authors evaluated clinical charts and radiographs of 13 patients receiving titanium surgical mesh (TSM)-bone graft composite to reconstruct the anterior spinal column in the thoracic or lumbar region. The objective of this review was to evaluate the stability and efficacy of the TSM-bone graft composite in the anterior spine after a complete or partial corpectomy. Sixteen patients with involvement of the thoracic or lumbar vertebral column after trauma, tumor, or infection underwent partial or complete corpectomy. In all patients the anterior defect was reconstructed using a TSM-bone graft composite. Three patients died within 12 months postoperatively due to primary malignant process. Thirteen of 16 patient charts and radiographs were evaluated for anterior fusion status, settling of the TSM-bone graft composite, and hardware failure. No pseudoarthroses were noted. Evidence of solid anterior fusion was noted in all patients. The average settling of the TSM-bone graft construct was 3 mm. All patients presenting with only pain and no neurological symptoms (n = 9) experienced early pain relief. For patients presenting with neurological symptoms (n = 4), the recovery was complete in three and partial in one. No patient was made neurologically worse, and there were no vascular injuries intra- or postoperatively. The study suggests that TSM-bone graft composite offers excellent biomechanical stability in the immediate postoperative period, permitting progressive maturation of the fusion mass."

The diagnosis was pelvic insufficiency fractures due to radiotherapy adverse effects on the skeletal system confirmed by CT and by the favorable scintigraphy and clinical outcome. Both bone metastases and insufficiency fractures must be considered in the differential diagnosis of bone pain in irradiated pelvises. The bone scintigraphy detects these insufficiency fractures early and can show a typical symmetric uptake pattern. In asymmetric lesions, the CT and clinical follow-up as well as the scintigraphic evolution of the lesions should confirm the findings of the bone scintigraphies."

CD008686,0,10466248,0,[Vascular cysts of the adrenals. Association with aneurysm of the abdominal aorta].,"A rare case of an adrenal vascular cyst associated to an abdominal aorta aneurysm is reported. Adrenal cysts are an uncommon clinical finding, in most cases incidentally discovered for nonspecific abdominal pain, during US, TC or RM evaluation or at autopsy. Small adrenal mass are clinically silent. They may be symptomatic (lumbar tension, pain) for dimensions over 10 centimetres. Cysts of large size can cause displacement and compression of adjacent organs. They present a difficult problem of differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Non-neoplastic adrenal cysts have been divided into four categories: parasitic (7%), epithelial (9%), endothelial (45%) and haemorrhagic or pseudocystic (39%). Vascular adrenal cysts may be a traumatic consequence of an hamartomatous vascular anomaly. The aim of this paper is to discuss, on the basis of the literature, the etiology, diagnosis and treatment of the adrenal mass. Surgical timing is discussed for the concomitant vascular lesion. The elective treatment was left adrenalectomy performed through transperitoneal approach. Surgery for abdominal aorta aneurysm was differed because the adrenal mass was suspected to be an infected neoplastic lesion and for the feasibility of endovascular procedure. The adrenal specimens contained a cystic structure with fluid blood, fibrin and calcifications. Normal adrenal cortical tissue was found in the cystic wall. This lesion (arising from vascular anomalies) require separation from haemorrhagic adrenal neoplasm. Awareness of adrenal pseudocysts and careful attention to the hystological features aids this distinction."

One of them, a 49-year-old man, had tumors in the right kidney and the right ischiadic bone. He underwent nephrectomy and pathologic findings showed renal cell carcinoma (tubular type, granular cell subtype, INF-gamma, G2). The other patient, a 33-year-old man with a previous history of left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (tubular type, granular cell subtype, INF-alpha, G2), was found to have a large tumor in the pelvis, extending from the pubic and iliac bones to the hip joint. Both patients underwent embolization of the hypervascular mass using a vascular coil followed by hemipelvectomy under general anesthesia.

CD008686,0,10433180,0,Vitamin D and calcium dysregulation in the polycystic ovarian syndrome.,"Over the past 30 years, numerous studies in invertebrates and vertebrates have established a role of calcium in oocyte maturation as well as in the resumption and progression of follicular development. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCO) is characterized by hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation, theca cell hyperplasia, and arrested follicular development. The aim of this observational study was to determine whether vitamin D and calcium dysregulation contribute to the development of follicular arrest in women with PCO, resulting in reproductive and menstrual dysfunction. Thirteen premenopausal women (mean age 31 +/- 7.9 years) with documented chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism were evaluated. Four women were amenorrheic and nine had a history oligomenorrhea, two of whom had dysfunctional bleeding. Nine had abnormal pelvic sonograms with multiple ovarian follicular cysts. All were hirsute, two had alopecia, and five had acanthosis nigricans. The mean 25 hydrovitamin D was 11.2 +/- 6.9 ng/ml [normal (nl): 9-52], and the mean 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D was 45.8 +/- 18 pg/ml. with one woman with a 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D <5 pg/ml (nl: 15-60). The mean intact parathyroid hormone level was 47 +/- 19 pg/ml (nl: 10-65), with five women with abnormally elevated parathyroid hormone levels. All were normocalcemic (9.3 +/- 0.4 mg/dl). Vitamin D repletion with calcium therapy resulted in normalized menstrual cycles within 2 months for seven women, with two experiencing resolution of their dysfunctional bleeding. Two became pregnant, and the other four patients maintained normal menstrual cycles. These data suggest that abnormalities in calcium homeostasis may be responsible, in part, for the arrested follicular development in women with PCO and may contribute to the pathogenesis of PCO."

Only six examples of this lesion were previously reported in the English-language medical literature. The lesions clinically manifested in five adults (3 women, 2 men) ranging in age from 22 to 46 years (mean, 37 yr). The process presented as a nodular mass that was asymptomatic in three patients and accompanied by vague neck pain or stiffness in the remaining two. Three patients related a history of head and neck trauma that preceded the discovery of the tumor. All of the tumors were situated in the deep soft tissue overlying the posterior aspect of the lower cervical vertebrae. The five patients were managed by complete local excision. The tumors measured 1.3 to 3.0 cm. in greatest dimension (mean, 2.5 cm.). Microscopically, the lesion consisted of a poorly delineated, nodular proliferation of moderately cellular fibrocartilaginous tissue arising within the substance of the nuchal ligament and extending into the surrounding soft tissues. No cytologic atypia or mitotic activity was identified. Follow-up data from four of the cases in this study (range, 10-324 mo) and four previously reported examples with follow-up (range, 3-12 mo) show no evidence of recurrent or persistent disease after simple excision. The nuchal fibrocartilaginous pseudotumor is a benign lesion caused by fibrocartilaginous metaplasia of the lower portion of the nuchal ligament, probably as a result of localized trauma or chronic mechanical stress."

During a 19-month period 10 patients with chronic pain--mainly mixed nociceptive-neuropathic pain--underwent implantation of the medication pump for long-term treatment. The mean follow-up period was 9.5 months. Pain relief was classified as very good in 22.2%, good in 44.4%, moderate in 22.2% and poor in 11.1%. In 88.9% of the cases the patients stated they would undergo the same procedure again. Technical problems (catheter dislocation) developed in 1/10 patients could be surgically corrected. One pump including catheter was explanted because of an infected seroma within the pocket area.

Therefore, we want to compare the results in patients with operative and conservative treatment to define standards for a good surgical result. Over a period of 9 years, we operated on eight patients with a lumbosacral extradural arachnoid cyst and treated eight others conservatively. Only three of the operated patients experienced a postoperative relief of pain, but none was symptom free. The only one with continuing success had a preoperative history of 1 year only. MRI scans without contrast agent were misinterpreted in one included and one excluded case. The results of conservative treatment were nearly the same as those of operative treatment. MRI is the best diagnostic tool, but a variety of sequences must be used. Patients with a short pain history and a clear neurological deficit profited most from surgery.

CD008686,0,10391814,0,Management of pain and spinal cord compression in patients with advanced cancer. ACP-ASIM End-of-life Care Consensus Panel. American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine.,"General internists often care for patients with advanced cancer. These patients have substantial morbidity caused by moderate to severe pain and by spinal cord compression. With appropriate multidisciplinary care, pain can be controlled in 90% of patients who have advanced malignant conditions, and 90% of ambulatory patients with spinal cord compression can remain ambulatory. Guidelines have been developed for assessing and managing patients with these problems, but implementing the guidelines can be problematic for physicians who infrequently need to use them. This paper traces the last year of life of Mr. Simmons, a hypothetical patient who is dying of refractory prostate cancer. Mr. Simmons and his family interact with professionals from various disciplines during this year. Advance care planning is completed and activated. Practical suggestions are offered for assessment and treatment of all aspects of his pain, including its physical, psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions. The methods of pain relief used or discussed include nonpharmacologic techniques, nonopioid analgesics, opioids, adjuvant medications, radiation therapy, and radiopharmaceutical agents. Overcoming resistance to taking opioids; initiating, titrating, and changing opioid routes and agents; and preventing or relieving the side effects they induce are also covered. Data on assessment and treatment of spinal cord compression are reviewed. Physicians can use the techniques described to more readily implement existing guidelines and provide comfort and optimize quality of life for patients with advanced cancer."

Radiographic joint destruction occurred within five and three months, respectively. The main clinical and radiological features of neuropathic arthropathy are reviewed, and diagnostic pitfalls are discussed. There are no specific laboratory tests or histologic findings. This now rare condition should be routinely considered in patients with severe joint destruction contrasting with minimal pain. The reasons for the decision to use trochanteric-iliac coaptation in one of our patients and a wait-and-see approach in the other are explained. The literature is reviewed.

CD008686,0,10369022,0,Acetabular osteoblastoma: description of a case.,"Osteoblastoma is a slow-progressing, benign bone tumor, that is not frequently observed in clinical orthopaedics (approximately 1% of all primary bone tumors). There is predilection for the vertebrae (posterior arch), the femur, the tibia, and the cranium; it affects young subjects (from 10 to 35 years), with predilection for males (males: females = 2:1). Symptoms are not very specific, characterized essentially by moderate, discontinuous pain, that is responsive to treatment by NSAIDS; it may, at times, be asymptomatic. On radiographic assessment it is viewed as a lytic area that is rounded, greater than 2 cm in size, with unclear margins, with or without peripheral bone reaction. It is not easy to diagnose osteoblastoma, particularly if it is localized in unusual sites, such as in the pelvis.

The authors report 3 patients with axis tumours who underwent surgery in 1993 and 1994. Clinical symptoms and signs included pain in three, myelopathy in two, vertebrobasilar circulatory insufficiency and cranial nerve lesions in two patients. Tumours have been resected through transoral and posterior pharyngeal wall approach. The purpose of surgery was decompression of nervous and vascular structures, and histological verification of the tumour. Tumour pathology was diverse and included: multiple myeloma, chordoma and metastatic tumour from stomach. There were no postoperative complications and improvement of neurological conditions was observed."
CD008686,0,10358833,0,[Advances in diagnostic procedures and treatment of spinal neoplasms].,"In the years 1958-1995 in the Department of Neurosurgery in Bydgoszcz we treated operatively 160 patients (100 men and 60 women aged 5-81 yrs) with spinal tumours causing spinal cord compression. Our material was useful in estimating the evolution in diagnostic procedures, treatment and limit of contraindications to surgery. We utilized previously analyzed patients' data from the years 1958-1987 (100 patients) and compared this with results from the years 1988-1995 (60 patients). In the years 1988-1995 we operated on twice as many patients per year than in the period 1958-1987 owing to better diagnostic and operative procedures and decrease of contraindications to treatment. In about 60 percent of patients the tumours were totally and subtotally removed. In recent period we performed 10 initial procedures of transpedicular stabilization. In most cases the extensiveness of tumours did not reach the level of three spinal segments. We confirmed good early results of treatment, particularly in cases with total resection of tumours, in about half the patients with spinal neoplasm, although the most common histological diagnoses were carcinoma (89 cases). In thirty percent of cases with carcinoma only pain was diminished."

Careful clinical examination disclosed Tinel's sign in the axilla. This clinical finding led to further investigation of this region. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a small tumour highly suggestive of a schwannoma. Surgical exploration and microscopic examination confirmed a diagnosis of schwannoma located on the radial trunk of the left brachial plexus. After tumour excision, the patient had immediate relief of pain without sensitive or motor sequelae. No recurrence has been observed after 3 years."
CD008686,0,10356695,0,Managing cancer pain poorly responsive to systemic opioid therapy.,"Large surveys of populations with cancer pain indicate that as many as 90% of patients can attain adequate relief of pain using optimal, systemic, opioid-based pharmacotherapy. Skilled clinicians should be able to achieve this benchmark and should also be knowledgeable about the variety of clinical strategies that may be used to manage pain in those patients who are poorly responsive to routine measures. These strategies can be conceptualized in four broad categories: 1) opening the ""therapeutic window"" by more aggressive side effect management, 2) identifying an opioid with a more favorable balance between analgesia and side effects through ""opioid rotation,"" 3) introducing a pharmacologic technique that reduces the systemic opioid requirement (either treatment with a systemic coanalgesic or a trial of intraspinal therapy), or 4) offering a trial of a nonpharmacologic intervention that may reduce the systemic opioid requirement (e.g., nerve block). In the absence of comparative trials, the selection of a specific approach depends on an informed risk/benefit evaluation based on information from a comprehensive clinical assessment."
CD008686,0,10352742,0,Surgical management of intramedullary hemangioblastoma of the spinal cord.,"This is a study on 19 patients, who underwent complete excision of an intramedullary hemangioblastoma of the spinal cord during the period 1984-1997. The study was conducted to evaluate their functional outcome. Some peculiarities of their clinical presentation and surgical treatment are discussed as well. There were 12 males and 7 females whose age ranged from 16 to 69 years. Five of 6 patients were affected by Lindau's disease had multiple intramedullary tumors. The length of their history averaged 22.6 months. While pain was the most common complaint at presentation, 12 out of 19 patients had progressive sensorimotor deficits. A total of 22 operation was performed. One patient underwent resection of a minute tumor residue a few months after the first operation. In 2 patients with multiple tumors a second tumor, which became clinically relevant, was resected 17 and 36 months after the first operation. There was no mortality. One patients developed a wound infection which required secondary closure. The functional status of the patients registered at discharge was worse in 22.7%, unchanged in 59.1%, and improved in 18.2% of the patients. At follow-up (6-142 months), the status of 9.1% of the patients was still worse, in 50% was unchanged and in 40.9% better than the preoperative one. All but one patients had complete postoperative pain relief. The data support the concept that radical excision of intramedullary hemangioblastomas can be achieved at low levels of surgical mortality and morbidity. Symptomatic patients should undergo surgery before they develop extensive sensorimotor deficits. In patients with multiple lesions, tumors distant from the symptomatic one should not be tackled."

CD008686,0,10348069,0,Aseptic meningitis in the newborn and young infant.,"When a toxic newborn or young infant presents with fever and lethargy or irritability, it is important to consider the diagnosis of meningitis even if the classic localizing signs and symptoms are absent. Cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained (unless lumbar puncture is clinically contraindicated) to enable initial therapy to be planned. Initial results of cerebrospinal fluid testing may not conclusively differentiate between aseptic and bacterial meningitis, and antimicrobial therapy for all likely organisms should be instituted until definitive culture results are available. Comprehensive therapy, including antibacterial and antiviral agents, should continue until a cause is identified and more specific therapy is initiated, an etiology is excluded or the patient improves considerably and the course of antimicrobial therapy is completed. Group B streptococcus is the most common bacterial etiologic agent in cases of meningitis that occur during the first month after birth. Etiologies of aseptic meningitis include viral infection, partially treated bacterial meningitis, congenital infections, drug reactions, postvaccination complications, systemic diseases and malignancy. Long-term sequelae of meningitis include neuromuscular impairments, learning disabilities and hearing loss. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to improved outcome."

CD008686,0,10339781,0,A leptomeningeal metastasis revealed by sciatica.,"Meningeal metastatic disease usually occurs as a complication of a brain tumor and is exceptionally isolated in patients with solid tumors. We report the case of a 74-year-old woman admitted for mechanical S1 sciatica refractory to drug therapy. She had been treated for breast cancer three years earlier. Physical findings were pain upon hyperextension of the lumbar spine and absence of the ankle jerks. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid sampled during an intrathecal glucocorticoid injection showed 1 g/L of protein and 11 normal cells per mm3. Grade 3 L5-S1 spondylolisthesis was seen on plain radiographs, computed tomography scans, and magnetic resonance imaging scans. At that point, the patient developed sphincter dysfunction and motor loss in the left lower limb in the distribution of several nerve roots. Findings were normal from a myelogram and a magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain. A repeat cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed 1.1 g/L of protein and 5 cells/mm3. Because of the discrepancy between the clinical and imaging study findings, the patient was transferred to a neurology department. A third cerebrospinal fluid study showed numerous adenocarcinoma cells, and a repeat magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass in the dural sac opposite L2. A program of monthly intrathecal methotrexate injections was started. A fatal meningeal relapse occurred eight months later."

CD008686,0,10325728,0,Rapid onset transverse myelitis in adolescence: implications for pathogenesis and prognosis.,"Five adolescents with transverse myelitis were reviewed. All presented with a rapid onset paralysis of the lower limbs and impairment of bladder control. The maximum disability developed between 10 minutes and six hours. There was no history of trauma, asthma, or prodromal illness. Investigations failed to demonstrate a vascular cause. Extensive spinal cord abnormalities were observed on magnetic resonance imaging. Electrophysiological investigations, performed in four cases, were all consistent with anterior horn cell damage. In all five adolescents there was poor recovery. The underlying pathogenesis of this rapid onset condition remains a subject of debate. Similarities with both transverse myelitis and fibrocartilaginous emboli are evident, widening the spectrum of conditions within the transverse myelitis umbrella. These observations suggest that in rapid onset ""transverse myelitis"" the combination of extensive hyperintensity on spinal cord neuroimaging with electrophysiological evidence of anterior horn cell involvement might have adverse prognostic significance."
CD008686,0,10320528,0,Novel serum markers of bone resorption: clinical assessment and comparison with established urinary indices.,"Although urinary measurements of collagen degradation provide valid estimates of bone resorption, their clinical application is hampered by pronounced analytical and biological variability. Therefore, immunoassays for the determination of such parameters in serum have been developed. In this study, we assessed the performance of three new serum markers of bone turnover, i.e., C-terminal and N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (S-CTX and S-NTX) and bone sialoprotein. Results were compared with urinary total pyridinoline, total deoxypyridinoline, and urinary C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (U-CTX) and urinary N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (U-NTX). The study population included healthy men (n = 27), premenopausal (n = 30) and postmenopausal (n = 31) women, patients with hepatic dysfunction (HF, n = 24), renal failure (RF, n = 30), breast cancer without (BC-, n = 24) and with (BC+, n = 30) bone metastases, primary vertebral osteoporosis (OPO, n = 27), primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT, n = 16), active Paget's disease of bone (n = 18), multiple myeloma (MM, n = 18), and patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy before and after treatment with pamidronate (HOM, n = 28). Changes in urinary and serum markers were similar in most metabolic bone diseases. However, differentiation between healthy controls and OPO, or PHPT, was improved by the serum markers. In MM, all serum and urinary markers were elevated (p < 0. 05 vs. controls). In BC+, skeletal involvement was reflected by significant increments in all indices (p < 0.01 vs. BC-), except U-CTX and S-CTX. In HOM, pamidronate-induced changes in biomarkers were most pronounced for U-CTX and S-CTX and S-NTX. HF and RF were associated with elevated levels of all serum markers (p < 0.05 vs. controls). In conclusion, measurements in serum reflect bone resorption to the same extent as the urinary indices. Since serum markers circumvent some of the limitations of urinary measurements, their use potentially improves the assessment of skeletal disorders."

In this retrospective study, we studied urological examinations obtained in 36 consecutive patients. Urological examinations were ultrasonography of bladder and kidney, voiding cystourethrography (VCG), and urodynamic cystometry. In those of them, 6 patients had already had urinary dysfunction at preoperative stage, but 4 patients' spinal lipoma was one complication of cloaca exstrophy and 2 patients' spinal lipoma after repairment of their myelomeningocele. In the remaining 30 cases, 18 patients (60.0%) as the group 1 did not have urinary dysfunction and abnormality in any urological examinations. Another 7 patients (23.3%) as group 2 also did not have urinary dysfunction, but abnormal vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was found out in their VCG examination. At postoperative stage, abnormal VUR resolved or improved in all these 7 cases, but one of them showed transient urinary retention. Two patients of 18 in the group 1 had to require clean intermittent self-catheterization at postoperative stage. These observations confirmed that children with spinal lipoma were more likely to present with urological findings, and so it was imperative that a diagnosis be made and treatment be instituted as early as possible."

CD008686,0,10221092,0,[Insufficiency fractures of the sacrum].,"In two women aged 85 and 62 years respectively, with pain in the lower back and the hip region, insufficiency fractures of the sacrum were diagnosed. They were treated by bed rest and pain medication with good clinical outcome. Especially in older, postmenopausal women who have been treated for a malignancy (possibly with irradiation of the pelvis), the possibility of sacral insufficiency fractures should be kept in mind. Many unnecessary and sometimes invasive investigations to exclude tumour or metastases can be avoided by adequate diagnostic imaging: first conventional X-ray investigation followed by skeletal scintigraphy. A typical H-shaped pattern of sacral uptake is diagnostic of insufficiency fractures. As this pattern is seen in only approximately 20% of the patients, additional CT will often be necessary. CT can demonstrate the fracture lines and exclude bone destruction or a soft tissue mass. In case CT is not conclusive MRI is indicated."

CD008686,0,10214045,0,[So-called benign metastasizing leiomyoma of the lung presenting with bone metastases].,"The patient, a 42-year-old woman, was admitted to our hospital because of abnormal shadows on chest X-ray films obtained during a routine medical check-up. Her medical history included a uterine myomectomy at the age of 21, and thereafter, periodic lumbago and back pain for which she had not sought any medical treatment. Chest computed tomography detected a number of pulmonary nodules in both whole lung fields, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed many spherical metastatic lesions in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Although we initially suspected lung cancer, no primary lesion was found. A thoracoscopic lung biopsy revealed leiomyomatous tumors that were histologically similar to the uterine myoma removed 21 years previously. The final diagnosis was so-called benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML). Because the removed tumor contained a high concentration of progesterone receptors (240 fmol/mg), a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue was administered, and proved effective in relieving the patient's periodic lumbago and back pain. The findings in this case suggested that the so-called BML was in fact a metastasis of a low-grade uterine leiomyosarcoma."

Because of severe thrombocytopenia, she was given radiation therapy at 50 Gy with great effectiveness. The thrombocytopenia was diagnosed as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Because the patient refused to undergo a splenectomy operation, she was treated with prednisolone, gamma-globulin, and danazol with no effect. In January 1995 she began receiving azathioprine and her platelet count gradually increased. In March, she complained of severe left abdominal pain but abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans showed no abnormal findings. Nonetheless, the patient's lumbago persisted and her liver dysfunction was progressive. Abdominal CT scans performed on April 18 disclosed multiple liver tumors. The patient died on April 28. Autopsy revealed that the cervical cancer was the primary origin of the liver tumors. We concluded that extra precautions should be taken when administering immunosuppressive therapy to patients with a history of malignant diseases."

The majority of the patients is suffering from non-specific low back pain. However, the high incidence of benign, self-limiting low back pain leads to the risk of overlooking specific causes such as tumor or infection. Similarly, relevant paresis and bladder and bowel dysfunction must be diagnosed in time. Furthermore, the aim of the diagnostic work-up is to diagnose and treat specific causes of back and leg pain (e.g. disc herniation and spinal stenosis) to avoid chronicity.

Renal hydatid cyst (RHC) raises therapeutic problems due to its complications, which sometimes make kidney-preserving cyst resection surgery difficult. The authors report a series of 45 cases of RHC treated in their department during a 20-year period. This series consisted of 27 men and 18 women with a mean age of 47 years (26-80 years). The clinical features were dominated by pain (80%), flank mass (42%), hydaturia (22%), haematuria (13%), urinary tract infection (6%), hypertension (3%). IVU, performed in all patients, showed calcifications in 35% of cases, renal tumour syndrome in 71% of cases and silent kidney in 22% of cases. Surgery was usually performed via a lumbar incision (75%) or a BARAYA incision (15%). Treatment consisted of 18 cyst roof resections (40%), 6 pericystectomies (13%), partial nephrectomy in 2 cases (4%) and total nephrectomy in 18 cases (40%). The postoperative course was marked by urinary fistula in two patients and one death at the 2nd postoperative month related to associated renal sarcoma.

CD008686,0,10094256,0,Neurological complications of neurofibromatosis type 1 in adulthood.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disease with a wide range of neurological manifestations. To examine these, and to evaluate neurological morbidity in adulthood of patients with NF1, we studied a hospital-based series of 158 patients that included 138 adult patients aged >18 years and 20 children. NF1 evaluation included a multidisciplinary clinical and a clinically oriented radiological investigation. Neurological events occurring during childhood (in both children and adults of the series) and adulthood were recorded. One or several neurological manifestations have been observed in 55% of patients (adults and children) (n = 87). These included: headache (28 patients); hydrocephalus (7); epilepsy (5); lacunar stroke (1); white matter disease (1); intraspinal neurofibroma (3); facial palsy (1); radiculopathy (5); and polyneuropathy (2). Tumours included: optic pathway tumours (20); meningioma (2); cerebral glioma (3); and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (6). Life-threatening complications were observed in five adults and included four malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours and one meningioma. Pain was the leading symptom in 11 adults and was related to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, complications of intraspinal neurofibromas, subcutaneous neurofibromas and peripheral nerve neurofibromas. NF1 in adults was not associated with other disabling or life-threatening neurological complications. Symptomatic optic pathway tumours, cerebral gliomas, symptomatic aqueductal stenosis and spinal compression due to intraspinal NF were observed exclusively during childhood. In this series, the predominant neurological features of adults with NF1 were chronic pain and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours."

The identification and molecular-biological characterization of an inducible COX isoform (COX-2) in inflammatory cells led to the hypothesis that a selective inhibition of COX-2 would result in relief of inflammation and pain without causing the COX-1-dependent side effects (gastrointestinal ulceration, platelet dysfunction, kidney damage) of conventional NSAIDs. On the basis of data obtained in several laboratories by means of the ""human whole blood assay"" there is now convincing evidence that none of the currently available NSAIDs is a selective COX-2 inhibitor. Meanwhile, the specific COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib are being tested worldwide in phase III clinical trials on patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. However, the simple concept of COX-2 being an exclusively proinflammatory inducible enzyme cannot be upheld any longer. In addition, COX-2 is expressed constitutively in brain, spinal cord and kidney, as well as in numerous other organs. In the present review the perspectives and possible risks of specific COX-2 inhibitors are discussed, as well as additional indications for their implementation (e.g. colon cancer)."
CD008686,0,10093409,0,[Algorithm in low back pain management in adults].,"Currently recommended management for low back pain in adults is presented. The algorithm consists of two phases. In a patient presenting acute low back pain with no previous history thorough clinical evaluation (phase I) should aim at exclusion of cauda equina syndrome, fracture, neoplasm, infection, progressive neurological deficit, or chronic pain syndrome. If none of these condition is responsible for low back pain 4-6 weeks therapy depending on the severity of symptoms should be commenced. Then clinical reevaluation is indicated and if pain persists patient should be referred to a specialist (phase II). Previous diagnosis and treatment should be reviewed critically; if found appropriate the treatment might be repeated during phase II. Primary sources of low back pain as herniated nucleus pulposus, unremitting low back pain (segmental instability), spondylolysis, isthmic spondylolisthesis degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis should be identified and appropriate treatment (surgical or conservative) undertaken. Patient education is an important component of phase II. In general, phase II of the algorithm aims at returning the patient to full psychophysical activity and at prevention of low back pain recurrence."
CD008686,0,10088919,0,Functional assessment of the shoulder following latissimus dorsi muscle donation in the handicapped.,"The latissimus dorsi muscle, one of the largest muscles in the human body, has gained widespread popularity in microsurgical reconstruction. Because the latissimus serves to adduct and medially rotate the upper extremity, caution in its use has been advocated in handicapped and non-ambulatory patients, although a paucity of information exists in the literature. The purpose of this reported project was to determine whether the loss of the latissimus dorsi could be documented objectively or subjectively, either in the preoperative condition or post-harvesting in the handicapped patients. Two paraplegic patients were studied. Results indicate a lack of objective functional deficit; this includes both the nerve-blocked state and the postoperative condition. In addition, both patients failed to demonstrate the need to change any activities of daily living. This evidence suggests that, although careful decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis, the use of the latissimus dorsi muscle is not necessarily contraindicated in this group of patients."

CD008686,0,10073625,0,Low back pain and the lumbar intervertebral disk: clinical considerations for the doctor of chiropractic.,Low back pain exists in epidemic proportions in the United States. Studies that demonstrate innervation to the intervertebral disk provide evidence that may account for instances of discogenic low back pain encountered in general medical and chiropractic practice. Many patients and health care practitioners believe that intervertebral disk lesions require surgery as the only method of treatment that will result in satisfactory outcome. Surgery rates vary widely across geographic regions. Only one randomized prospective study exists that compares surgical and nonsurgical treatment; it demonstrated essentially equal outcomes in the long run.

We reviewed our experience of paediatric spinal tumours over the period 1992-96. Nineteen patients presented during this time, 12 males and 7 females with the mean age of 7.8 years. The main presenting symptoms were pain, limb weakness, ataxia, sensory disturbance and spinal curvature abnormalities with a mean duration of 10 months. There was a wide variety of tumour types. All underwent a laminectomy with 8 having total tumour excision, 5 partial excision, and 6 had biopsies only. Five patients had extradural lesions and fourteen were intra-dural, four of which were extramedullary and six were intramedullary tumours. There were no major complications of surgery and only one patient had a CSF leak which was repaired. The average hospital stay was 15 days. Seven patients underwent radiotherapy and four had chemotherapy. Four patients are disease free and seven are symptom free after a mean follow-up of 2 years.

CD008686,0,10027316,0,Use of positron emission tomography in evaluation of brachial plexopathy in breast cancer patients.,"18-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has previously been used successfully to image primary and metastatic breast cancer. In this pilot study, 19 breast cancer patients with symptoms/signs referrable to the brachial plexus were evaluated with 18FDG-PET. In 11 cases computerized tomography (CT) scanning was also performed. Of the 19 patients referred for PET study, 14 had abnormal uptake of 18FDG in the region of the symptomatic plexus. Four patients had normal PET studies and one had increased FDG uptake in the chest wall that accounted for her axillary pain. CT scans were performed in 9 of the 14 patients who had positive brachial plexus PET studies; six of these were either normal or showed no clear evidence of recurrent disease, while three CTs demonstrated clear brachial plexus involvement. Of two of the four patients with normal PET studies, one has had complete resolution of symptoms untreated while the other was found to have cervical disc herniation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The remaining two patients almost certainly had radiation-induced plexopathy and had normal CT, MRI and PET study. These data suggest that 18FDG-PET scanning is a useful tool in evaluation of patients with suspected metastatic plexopathy, particularly if other imaging studies are normal. It may also be useful in distinguishing between radiation-induced and metastatic plexopathy."

CD008686,0,9989361,0,[A 63-year-old man with progressive cauda equina/conus medullaris syndrome].,"A 63-year-old man, whose father died of malignant lymphoma, developed subacutely cauda equina/conus medullaris syndrome progressed over 3 months. Initial radicular pain, ascending motor and sensory paralysis without sacral sparing, vesicorectal dysfunction were similar with signs of spinal dural arteriovenous fistula. However, mild inflammatory signs, raised serum LDH, predominantly of LDH 3, lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated beta 2 microglobulin in CSF suggested neurolymphomatosis. It was not supported, however, after CSF immunocytochemistry, myelogram, CT, Gd-MRI and Ga scan. Spinal cord/nerve root vascular syndromes of intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL) according to Glass J et al. was suspected because of the unique neurological progression similar to Foix-Alajouanine syndrome, hypoxia without abnormalities in chest X-ray film, response to steroids and raised serum soluble IL-2 receptor. Multiple biopsies were performed with negative results. However, after all muscle biopsy confirmed IVL. The lower spinal irradiation was not effective. But CHOP regimen supplemented by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) brought about swift neurological improvement and protection from late complications. Self-limiting polyneuropathy emerged during the biweekly CHOP therapy, 6 courses for 12 weeks. Eventually he was neurologically improving 10 months after the chemotherapy and adrenal enlargement, which was possibly of metastasis, was only against complete remission. This case was good outcome by biweekly CHOP using G-CSF when compared with very high mortality in reported IVL cases besides vincristine neurotoxicity under compromised blood-brain/nerve barrier due to IVL might affect the functional recovery. This case with IVL implied raised soluble IL-2 receptor and progressive cauda equina syndrome/ascending myelopathy as diagnostic clues, and efficiency of muscle biopsy to confirm IVL."

Magnetic resonance imaging is the investigation of choice for diagnosis and followup. This typically shows T1 and T2 signal prolongation, cord widening, and contrast enhancement over several spinal segments. We describe a 21-year-old woman with SLE who developed very extensive SLE related transverse myelitis with longitudinal involvement of the spinal cord from C3 to T2 and from T7 to the conus medullaris. Clinically, this was manifest as leg weakness, bladder dysfunction, severe low back pain, and patchy lower limb sensory loss. She responded to treatment with pulse cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids with complete recovery in 3 months. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of such an extensive ""longitudinal"" myelitis."
CD008686,0,9972764,0,Assessment of the level of sensory block after subarachnoid anesthesia using a pressure palpator.,"In a cross-over study, we compared two methods of assessing the level of sensory block during subarachnoid anesthesia: the traditional pinprick sensation or a novel pressure palpator exerting a pressure of 650 g. Fifty patients scheduled for transurethral surgery under subarachnoid anesthesia were randomly assigned to be tested for spread of sensory block. In Group 1, the pressure palpator was followed by pinprick; in Group 2, the reverse sequence was used. Evaluation was performed 15 and 25 min after the subarachnoid injection of 2 mL of 5% lidocaine hyperbaric solution. In Group 1, the level of sensory block assessed with the pressure palpator was 1.7 +/- 3.2 cm (0.5 +/- 1.2 dermatomes) higher than that with the pinprick at 15 min, and 2.2 +/- 3.4 cm (0.6 +/- 1.0 dermatomes) higher than that with the pinprick 25 min after the block. In Group 2, the difference was accentuated. The level of sensory block assessed by pinprick 15 min after subarachnoid lidocaine was 5.7 +/- 4.8 cm (1.2 +/- 0.9 dermatomes) lower than the level with the pressure palpator, and 4.2 +/- 3.3 cm (0.9 +/- 0.6 dermatomes) lower than that with the pressure palpator at 25 min. In all instances, the pressure palpator gave a significantly higher assessment than the pinprick. We conclude that the pressure palpator, when preceded by the pinprick test, is associated with an increased threshold. This method may be useful in assessing the sensory block produced by subarachnoid anesthesia."
CD008686,0,9972752,0,Craniotomy procedures are associated with less analgesic requirements than other surgical procedures.,"The conventional wisdom that neurosurgical patients experience minimal postoperative pain and require little analgesia has been challenged. To address this, we reviewed our anesthesia and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) records for 1995 and compared pain management in patients undergoing major intracranial and selected extracranial procedures. We recorded patient weight, operative time, time in the PACU, intraoperative and postoperative opioid use, PACU pain scores, and level of consciousness in patients who had undergone open fixation of mandible or maxilla (Group E), clipping of aneurysms or excision of tumors (Group I), or lumbar laminectomy (Group L). Group I (n = 78) patients received less fentanyl in the operating room (0.016 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) versus 0.023 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for Group E [n = 134] and 0.023 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for Group L [n = 21]; P < 0.05), received less morphine in the PACU (0.0004 vs 0.0013 vs 0.0015 mg kg(-1) x min(-1); P < 0.005), reported lower pain scores (0.76 vs 2.5 vs 2.4; P < 0.05), and spent less time in the PACU (89.5 vs 109 vs 105 min; P < 0.05) than Group E or L patients. Our results were similar when only patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores > or = 14 were used in a subset analysis. We conclude that patients suffer less pain and use fewer opioids in the PACU after intracranial surgery than after facial reconstruction or lumbar laminectomy. Our results confirm that the average craniotomy patient has less postoperative pain than patients who undergo other surgical procedures, although patients who undergo frontal craniotomy may require more aggressive pain management."

CD008686,0,9928770,0,Problems of long-term spinal opioid treatment in advanced cancer patients.,"Epidural and intrathecal techniques are well established techniques in cancer pain. However, several questions remain unresolved. The several problems of long-term spinal opioid treatment in advance cancer patients were reviewed. Indications for the use of spinal opioids include patients treated by systemic opioids with effective pain relief but with unacceptable side effects, or unsuccessful treatment with sequential strong opioid drug trials despite escalating doses. Therefore, the previous aggressive treatment with systemic opioids would leave as failures patients with difficult pain syndromes unresponsive to opioids. The choice of external or totally implanted delivery systems is based on different clinical considerations. The use of externalized tunneled intrathecal catheters has not been associated with higher rates of complications and is easier to place and use at home in debilitated patients late in the course of their disease. The intrathecal administration has a lower incidence of catheter occlusion, lower malfunctioning rate, lower dose requirement, and more effective pain control. Due to the lower daily doses and volumes, intrathecal treatment proved to be more suitable for treatment at home by a continuous infusion than the epidural treatment. Advantages of infusion techniques are more evident when using local anesthetics, since intermittent administration of bupivacaine often results in motor paralysis and hemodynamic instability. Morphine is the opioid of choice. An epidural dose of 10% of the systemic dose is often used. However, intrathecal administration of opioids and bupivacaine may substantially improve pain relief in patients unresponsive to high epidural doses of these drugs, Bupivacaine-induced adverse effects, including sensory deficits, motor complaints, signs of autonomic dysfunction or neurotoxicity have been reported to not occur with bupivacaine doses less than 30-60 mg/day. Adjuvant drugs may further improve analgesia. Different ranges of technical complication rates have been reported in the literature, most of them being associated with epidural catheters. Subcutaneous tunneling and fixation of the catheter, bacterial filters, minimum changes of tubings, careful exit site care weekly, site protection and monitoring of any sign of infection to prevent infection, and training for family under supervision, are recommended. Areas for additional research include the use of spinal adjuvants, the ideal spinal morphine-bupivacaine ratio. methods to improve spinal opioid responsiveness and long-term catheter management with appropriate home care programs."

Diagnoses included 16 malignant and 36 nonmalignant vertebral and spinal cord tumors. Mean age at diagnosis was 8 years 1 month, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.7:1. Overall, there was an average delay in diagnosis of 12 months for this group of patients. Mean clinical follow-up was 5 years. The two most common reasons for presentation were pain (67%) and spinal deformity (46%). Initial plain radiographs were positive in 82% of patients. Postlaminectomy spinal deformity occurred at a rate of 45% in patients undergoing laminectomies, and 60% of those with deformity required spinal fusion. Overall, 67% of the 52 patients underwent spinal fusion, with a 9% asymptomatic pseudarthrosis rate. Complications were common, with 1.9 complications per patient; 59% of complications required surgical management. There were no perioperative deaths.

His immediate postoperative course was complicated by the development of a severe frontal headache. Initial conservative treatment included oral analgesics and an epidural blood patch. The headache persisted and was followed by progressive vision loss and a right partial third nerve palsy. The patient was almost blind at the time of transfer to our neurosurgical unit. Relevant investigations revealed marked hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration 122 mmol litre-1) and second-degree heart block (Mobitz I). A CT scan showed a pituitary tumour and confirmed the clinical diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy. Urgent craniotomy was scheduled and a large necrotic pituitary adenoma was excised. The postoperative course was uneventful with return of near normal vision at the time of discharge. Clinicians should consider this diagnosis when focal neurological deficits occur with post-dural puncture headache.

All patients had degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine and same-day anterior spinal fusion by using titanium cages packed with autograft bone and posterior instrumentation combined with a posterolateral autogenous bone graft. The purpose of this study was to determine whether anterior titanium cage placement and posterior instrumentation with autologous bone graft was a safe and efficacious procedure in patients with degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. Fusion rates, complications, pain relief, medication use, and work status were specifically analyzed. Although previous reports documented the use of this technique for trauma and tumor cases, few studies assessed clinical and radiographic results in patients with degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine. Plain radiographs were used to determine spinal fusion at each spinal level. All patients were administered preoperative and postoperative questionnaires regarding three specific clinical-outcome parameters. These consisted of pain level, medication use, and work status. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were also documented. Radiographic results showed that 61 (97%) of 63 lumbar levels undergoing an arthrodesis procedure fused either anteriorly, posteriorly, or both. Of the 35 patients in this series, 33 (94%) fused at all levels, and two did not. Substantial pain relief was reported in 46% of all patients. Thirteen (37%) patients had one or more surgical complications. Circumferential spinal fusion in patients with degenerative etiologies yields excellent radiographic fusion rates and good pain relief.

CD008686,0,9879774,0,Suspected spinal cord compression in breast cancer patients: a multidisciplinary risk assessment.,"Breast cancer is the most common cause of metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (SCC) in women, and this condition results in significant neurologic dysfunction and morbidity. Prior studies of patients with suspected SCC did not employ multivariate analysis techniques, often included persons with a wide variety of malignancies, and generally focused on identifying associated neurologic and radiologic features. We therefore conducted a study examining a more comprehensive set of potential clinical risk factors in breast cancer patients with suspected SCC. We retrospectively analysed 123 episodes of suspected SCC among 93 breast cancer patients evaluated by spine computed tomography (CT) scanning. Multiple logistic regression analysis was employed to identify independent predictors of SCC. Clinically significant metastatic epidural cancer was defined as thecal sac compression (TSC), which occurred in 33 episodes (27%). Four independent predictors of TSC were identified and included oncologic features (known bone metastases > or = 2 years, metastatic disease at initial diagnosis) in addition to neurologic and radiologic features (objective weakness, vertebral compression fracture on spine radiograph). These four predictors stratified episodes into subgroups with widely varying risks of TSC, ranging from 12% (0 risk factors) to 85% (> or = 3 risk factors). These results suggest that the evaluation of breast cancer patients with suspected SCC should include clinical information about their disease course in addition to neurologic examination and prior imaging studies. If confirmed, these predictors may help clinicians assess risk in this patient population."
CD008686,0,9879697,0,Parainfectious conus myelitis.,"We describe electroclinical and imaging features of a peculiar type of parainfectious myelitis that selectively involves the conus/epiconus region of the spinal cord. Twelve patients of parainfectious myelitis with MRI evidence of inflammatory lesions in the conus/epiconus region of the spinal cord were studied. All patients underwent full clinical and electrophysiological evaluation along with MRI of the spine. MRI included axial images at the site of lesion. All patients had a unique clinical presentation with urinary symptoms. Careful clinical examination revealed minimal sensorimotor dysfunction in the lower lumbar and sacral segments, which remained unnoticed by most of the patients; three female patients had no sensorimotor deficit. The motor paralysis recorded in four patients was flaccid and areflexic. The sensory level was inconspicuous as it was in the leg area corresponding to the lumbar and sacral spinal segments. Sensory loss was significantly more in the perineal region in those seven patients who had MRI evidence of inflammatory lesion in conus medullaris; two patients had maximum sensory loss in lumbar dermatomal distribution, which corresponded with the focal segmental myelitis involving 'epiconus'. MRI done in the sagittal plane was either normal or only 'suggestive' of myelitis in most of the patients and the inflammatory lesions were much more visible in the axial plane. The lesions predominantly involved central gray matter with spread to adjoining white matter in nine patients; in three patients with pure bladder involvement, lesions were confined to lateral gray matter of the conus medullaris. Our findings indicate that parainfectious myelitis (PIM) selectively involving conus medullaris is an important cause of unexplained acute or sub-acute urinary symptoms in adolescent and adult patients. In suspected cases, MRI must include axial images of the conus-epiconus region, as sagittal images may not always reveal the lesion. Due to initial presentation with urinary symptoms, absent or minimal sensory-motor signs, no transverse level over the trunk and unique MRI features, this condition may be called parainfectious conus myelitis (PICM)."
CD008686,0,9879102,0,Primary bone and metastatic tumors of the cervical spine.,"Cervical spine tumors, whether primary bone tumors or metastatic tumors, are rare. The possibility of tumors existing must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with persistent neck pain, with or without neurologic symptoms, particularly in those with significant pain at night. The clinical presentation is extremely variable, though a history of malignancy should always raise the concern for recurrence. The evaluation and diagnostic assessment includes a thorough physical examination. Radiographic imaging is usually initiated with plain radiographs and additional advanced imaging obtained as indicated. Using appropriate biopsy principles and techniques, tissue is obtained for histologic determination of the suspected lesion before surgical intervention. Treatment options are extremely variable and depend on many factors, including tumor type, location, and patient preference. Treatment warrants a multidisciplinary approach from experienced physicians and is most successfully accomplished in referral centers. Oncologic staging using the Enneking staging system, followed by surgical staging using the Weinstein, Boriani, Biagini system, will aid in the accurate characterization of the tumor load, maximize surgical goals, assure use of appropriate terminology, and provide optimal communication among treatment centers regarding tumor characteristics, treatment efforts, and results."
CD008686,0,9876247,0,Recurrent tethering: a common long-term problem after lipomyelomeningocele repair.,"The authors reviewed the records of 94 patients who underwent initial repair of a lipomyelomeningocele between 1982 and July 1996 at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh to determine the incidence and time course of symptomatic retethering. In each of these patients, the initial operative goals were to microsurgically debulk as much of the lipoma as possible to allow the conus to move freely within the spinal canal, to divide any tethering arachnoidal adhesions, to close the pia if possible and to reconstitute a capacious thecal sac, using a dural graft if necessary. With a median follow-up of 58 months, 19 of these patients (20.2%) required 28 subsequent operations for symptomatic retethering. Median time between the initial procedure and reoperation for retethering was 52 months. The primary complaint of 12 patients was intractable low-back or leg pain. Other common symptoms were progressive bowel and/or bladder dysfunction, deterioration of motor function and foot deformities. The decision to reoperate was based predominantly on the clinical situation of the patient; magnetic resonance imaging was used to confirm the location and extent of tethering. Patients with transitional lipomas had a significantly higher frequency of symptomatic retethering than those with caudal or dorsal lesions (p < 0.05). No other clinical or technical feature correlated with an increased frequency of retethering. In particular, none of a variety of types of dural graft materials appeared to entirely prevent symptomatic retethering. Following reoperation, pain complaints resolved and many of the other symptoms improved partially or resolved completely. Although the long-term results were also favorable in the majority of patients, a small subgroup (n = 6) exhibited repetitive symptomatic tethering that proved increasingly difficult to treat. We concluded that symptomatic retethering is a common problem in children with lipomyelomeningoceles, even after an adequate initial operation. To date, no type of graft material has been shown to entirely prevent this problem. Close long-term surveillance of such patients is required to allow detection and treatment of symptomatic retethering."

We report a a 65-year-old patient with a thoracic osteochondroma involving the neural arch of T6, and the corresponding rib, who was followed-up for 5 years. Approximately 3 years after partial surgical removal, the lesion manifested as a dumbbell mass passing through the neural foramen leading to cord compression, and a hemilaminectomy was performed with subtotal tumor excision. A clinical follow-up 2 years later revealed normal findings."
CD008686,0,9840340,0,Evaluation of clinical indexes to predict fate of pelvic nerve dysfunction.,"This study was designed to evaluate posterior urethral sensation and sacral reflex evoked by posterior urethral stimulation to predict fate of pelvic nerve dysfunction. Enrolled were 24 male patients sequentially receiving the following examinations 1-3 months (postoperative) and more then 6 months (follow-up) after surgery for rectal cancer: sensory thresholds of the penile skin (SS) and the posterior urethra (SU), sacral reflex evoked by penile stimulation (BCR) and posterior urethral stimulation (UUR), and urodynamic study. Controls included 25 patients with normal voiding function before pelvic surgery. SS, SU and latencies of BCR and UUR averaged 1.9+/-0.6 mA, 5.6+/-1.8 mA, 33.3+/-4.2 ms and 65.0+/-9.3 ms in controls, respectively, and unchanged postoperatively in 13 patients with normal voiding function. Of 11 patients with voiding dysfunction whose SS and latency of BCR remained unchanged, SU increased in 7, voiding function remained unrecovered in 6 patients during the follow-up period and recovered in the remaining 5. None of four patients with nonevocable UUR recovered voiding function. Thus, unchanged SU and disappearance of UUR were useful to predict recovery and nonrecovery of postoperative voiding dysfunction, respectively."

The authors report a case of 13-year-old girl with a family history of hereditary multiples exostoses who presented with bilateral sciatica and cauda equina compression. The MRI showed a tumor of the L1 vertebral body. After surgery, pathologic specimens revealed the lesion to be an osteochondroma. Involvement of the vertebral column has been estimated from 1.3 to 4%. Spinal cord compression is rare. CT provides the analysis of the components of the tumor and clearly demonstrates it's intracanalar extension. MRI is superior in visualizing spinal cord compression.

CD008686,0,9805704,0,Bilateral continuous 3-in-1 nerve blockade for postoperative pain relief after bilateral femoral shaft surgery.,"We tested the effectiveness of bilateral continuous paravascular femoral nerve blocks in a patient following bilateral femoral shaft surgery in whom other analgesic regimens were considered contraindicated or of limited effectiveness. Bilateral continuous femoral paravascular nerve blocks were performed using a previously described technique. General anesthesia was subsequently used to facilitate surgery, which was a bilateral osteosynthesis using dynamic hip screws for osteolytic metastases of the proximal extremities of both femurs. A continuous infusion of lidocaine, morphine, and clonidine was established in both femoral catheters preoperatively and used postoperatively as the principle source of analgesia. Radiographic contrast was used to document the position of both catheters and to document the spread of injectate. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores were recorded in the recovery room and at 4, 16, 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. Plasma lidocaine levels were determined by gas chromatography at 4, 16, and 48 hours postoperatively. Sensory assessment in the distribution of the femoral, lateral cutaneous, and obturator nerves was performed to confirm the presence of sensory blockade. We successfully provided analgesia with bilateral continuous femoral paravascular nerve blocks. Pain scores at rest were consistently rated good to excellent (VAS < 20 mm). Evidence of sensory conduction block was present throughout the infusion. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine were consistently below toxic levels (1.35 to 1.65 micrograms/ml). Radiographic contrast studies failed to demonstrate movement of contrast to the level of the lumbar plexus. Bilateral continuous femoral paravascular nerve blocks can be used to provide effective and safe analgesia in patients requiring aggressive analgesia in whom other techniques may be contraindicated."
CD008686,0,9802042,0,Use of interactive-intraoperative guidance during vertebrectomy and anterior spinal fusion with instrumental fixation: technical note.,"Anterior decompressive procedures for the treatment of vertebral tumors have become increasingly popular in an attempt to improve the quality of life, relieve pain, and preserve or restore neurologic function. However, these procedures carry a significant rate of complications including hardware failure, due in part to technical factors. A computer-assisted system allowing for precise preoperative planning and real-time intraoperative interactive image localization has been implemented for spine instrumentation to optimize anterior instrumental fixation. We discuss our initial clinical experience and application to anterior vertebrectomy, and vertebral reconstruction with anterior instrumental fixation. We believe that computer-assisted spine surgery using infrared-based technology offers the necessary elements to make its use fast, reliable, and intuitive, providing an accurate and safe approach for optimization of spine surgery."
CD008686,0,9801126,0,Multilocular cystic nephroma: an unusual localization.,"We present a case of multilocular cystic nephroma with an unusual localization treated by a nephron-sparing procedure. A 21-year-old white woman presented with a history of hematuria and right lumbar pain. Imaging techniques revealed a multilocular cystic mass originating from the renal parenchyma but mainly involving the renal pelvis. The lesion was localized almost entirely within the renal pelvis at surgery and was treated by excision. Pathologic analysis was consistent with multilocular cystic nephroma. The patient remains free of recurrence with 10 years of follow-up. We conclude that multilocular cystic nephroma may present as a cystic lesion localized within the renal pelvis, and we advocate simple excision of these lesions."

This was the third most common site of disease after the spine and femur. Overall, the mean age was 22.5 years, which was the same for the foot and ankle subset of patients; however, there was a significant male predominance in foot and ankle patients compared with the whole group. The majority of patients were skeletally mature (85.4%). Clinically, most patients presented with pain (97.2%), although one-third of the total related a history of antecedent trauma. The interval between the onset of symptoms and biopsy was 84 days (range, 0-572 days). Radiographically, the majority of lesions were in the hindfoot (N = 18; 44%) of which 16 of 18 tumors (89%) were in the talus. Of these, one-half were subperiosteal and dorsally based and were associated with osseous tumor matrix and a soft tissue mass. Two osteoblastomas, both in the metatarsals, transitioned into sarcomas; the rest were histologically benign. For diagnostic purposes, it was essential to obtain clinical, radiographic, and histologic correlation."

This lesion affected a 38-year-old male, with a tumor measuring 5 cm in diameter located in the posterior mediastinum in contact with the spinal cord, with erosion of the adjacent vertebra (T5), that caused constant pain localized in the right scapular region with an evolution of several weeks. The cytological characteristics of psammomatous melanotic schwannoma are discussed, along with the histological and immunohistochemical features of this infrequent neural tumor, which aid in establishing a differential diagnosis. The importance of a correct histological diagnosis of this tumor is of particular clinical relevance after having been identified as one of the possible components of Carney's complex. This possibility demands a meticulous patient exploration in search of any other components that make up this complex, given the aggressive character of some of them. These lesions could, if not detected early enough, produce fatal consequences for the patient, fundamentally in those patients with cardiac myxomas. In this case, following an exhaustive clinical examination there was no pathology associated with this complex. It is therefore considered to be an isolated psammomatous melanotic schwannoma, and not a part of Carney's complex."

CD008686,0,9773328,0,[Deglutition disorders].,"Dysphagia is related to the impairment of food passage from the mouth to the stomach. Globus pharyngis implies the frequent and often painful sensation of a lump in the throat that usually does not interfere with swallowing and may even be relieved by food intake. The diagnosis is based upon a careful history, clinical examination, endoscopy, dynamic imaging (videofluoroscopy, cinematography, videosonography) and electrophysiologic procedures (including pharyngoesophageal manometry, electromyography and pH determinations). Structural lesions of the cervical spine such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis are rare causes of dysphagia. Dysphagia following anterior cervical fusion as well as globus and dysphonia due to dysfunction of the vertebral joints are more likely. Symptoms with swallowing fluids indicate a neurogenic origin. Dyscoordinated swallowing, nasal reflux, dysphonia or general weakness may also occur. Chronic aspiration with respiratory compromize is the main consequence in a variety of neurological disorders as well as in cases of postsurgical dysphagia. Relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter indicates coordinated muscle movement between the pharynx and esophagus. Dysfunction of the pharyngoesophageal segment may lead to cricopharyngeal achalasia. A dyskinetic sphincter commonly represents an extrapharyngeal cause: i.e., disease associated with gastroesophageal reflux. Disorders of the esophageal phase of deglutition can produce retrosternal pain, heartburn, regurgitation and vomiting, as well as laryngeal and respiratory signs. Esophageal motility disorders include lower achalasia, tumors, peptic strictures, inflammatory diseases, drug-induced ulcers, rings and webs. Motility disorders present with aperistaltic, spontaneous contractions, diffuse esophagospasm, or a hypermotile esophagus. Gastroesophageal reflux with esophagitis must always be excluded, especially in patients with a globus sensation. The multiple features of the appearance of the symptoms of dysphagia and globus makes multidisciplinary approach necessary in order to establish a diagnosis and begin effective treatment."
CD008686,0,9767067,0,Neuropathic pain in the cancer patient.,"Cancer presents itself in numerous ways, adding to the complexity of any pain syndrome with which it is associated. Neuropathic pain, unlike many other pain syndromes, is difficult to treat even in the absence of cancer. The combination results in a heterogeneous group of patients with a complex set of symptoms. This makes the assessment of pain, classification of syndromes, and clinical study a challenge. If the disease is nonprogressive, general principles of care are essentially the same as in those without cancer. In patients with progressive disease and more refractory painful conditions, spinal anesthetic and neurosurgical therapies must often be considered. Under such circumstances, caregivers are forced to carefully balance uncertain benefits and risks, often without the luxury of time. More careful observation and controlled trials in these patients help facilitate this challenging process."

Conservative treatment and previous operations, including carpal tunnel release and first rib resection, provided no relief. A left scalenectomy was performed. During the removal of the anterior scalene muscle, a mass approximately 3 cm long and 1.5 cm in diameter was noted under the anterior scalene muscle involving the C7 nerve root. The tumour was encapsulated and covered with attenuated and stretched nerve fascicles. It was completely excised without disturbing the nerve fascicles.

Unusual causes of low back pain that have been previously identified include abdominal aortic aneurysms, pelvic neoplasms, and retroperitoneal hemorrhages. This report describes a case of back pain that was apparently caused by a duodenal ulcer. A 54-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with a complaint of mid to low back pain (T10-L2), which was diagnosed as joint dysfunction. A comprehensive treatment program was prescribed and the patient was instructed to return to clinic in 4 weeks. Three weeks later, he experienced a syncopal episode followed by coffee ground emesis. He immediately sought medical attention at an emergency room, where he was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a large duodenal ulcer, and the patient underwent vagotomy and pyloroplasty. He returned to his physiatrist's office 3 weeks after hospital discharge with minimal back pain. The cause of the back pain proved to be referred visceral pain from his duodenal ulcer. This case is presented to reemphasize the need to include the uncommon phenomena in the differential diagnosis of low back pain."

CD008686,0,9744001,0,[A case of a lumbar spinal synovial cyst located on the midline].,"We report a case of lumbar spinal synovial cyst located on the midline. A 72-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of low back pain radiating to the left buttock and posterior thigh. An MR image revealed an extradural cystic lesion adjacent to the dorsal side of the dural sac at the L4-5 level. The cyst was remote from the facet joints and existed on the midline just in front of the L4 lamina. A CT scan showed a concave deformity of the ventral aspect of the L4 lamina because of compression by the cyst. The patient underwent L4 laminectomy and total removal of the cyst. The cyst was in contact with the anterior surface of the ligamentum flavum and it had no connection with the facet joint. In the histological examination, the cyst was multilobular and lined with synovial epithelium. Therefore the cyst was diagnosed as a synovial cyst. After the operation, the pain radiating to the buttock and thigh completely disappeared. Intraspinal synovial cysts are usually located in the lower lumbar spine and most of them are adjacent to the facet joint. The cysts that are located on the midline are very rare. We review previous reports and discuss clinical and pathological features of spinal synovial cysts."
CD008686,0,9743953,0,[Late sequelae of CNS recurrence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood].,"Study objective was to evaluate retrospectively central nervous system (CNS) morbidity of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with intensive chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy for a first isolated or combined CNS relapse. Neurological (Touwen), neuropsychological (CFT 20, Wechsler scales, d2 attention test) and neuromorphological (CT, MRI) assessments were performed in 17 children (9 girls, 8 boys) aged between 7 and 14 years. Patients were off therapy for median 4 years; cranial radiotherapy for CNS relapse (12-24 Gy) was given to all patients 2 to 9 years ago (median 5.5 years). Ten patients had received preventive cranial radiotherapy during front-line treatment, previously. In this group, the cumulative radiation dose ranged between 30 and 39 Gy. Patients received 12 to 30 intrathecal methotrexate doses (median 22). Compared with normative levels for age (100 points) performance IQ (89.9) and full scale IQ (92.0), Culture Fair IQ (88.3) and attention and concentration (90.9) were significantly impaired. Verbal IQ (95.5) was not significantly different from normal expectations. Neurological investigations of 16 patients showed mild signs in 7 (44%) of them, mostly of fine-motor skills and coordination, but no major motor disability. In MRI and CT, white matter changes or ventricular enlargement were noted in 10 of 16 patients (63%). Parent-completed questionnaires indicated problem behaviors in 5 children. Cumulative doses of methotrexate correlated significantly with neuropsychological test results. Children irradiated twice as well as girls had poorer cognitive functions, not being statistically significant. Despite pathological test results, all children attended a normal school and did not exhibit obvious impairment in daily life. In conclusion, CNS relapse and attendant therapy, mostly consisting of a second course of cranial radiotherapy, caused measurable intellectual deficits and CNS morbidity, which did not result in severely impaired performance. Periodic psychological und clinical examinations are recommended for recognition of delayed morbiditiy and early intervention."
CD008686,0,9742344,0,Pathogenesis and management of persistent postthoracotomy pain.,"Persistent chest wall pain is common after thoracotomy and is usually caused by recurrence or progression of malignancy. It should prompt efforts to identify and treat the causative disease. A minority of patients experience persistent pain not related to neoplasm. This pain may last for years, but is usually not severe. A small subset of these patients experience persistent severe pain, which may be debilitating. The pain may be owing to various causes. Diagnosis and treatment should be individualized and directed toward the causes believed to be present. First-line pharmacologic therapies include NSAIDs, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and low-dose opioids. Some patients require more sophisticated treatment from multidisciplinary pain-management clinics. This treatment may include nerve blocks, physical therapy, sympathectomy, cryoneurolysis, or long-term neuromodulation with epidural analgesia or spinal cord stimulation. Because of the severe pain these patients may experience and the difficulty and expense associated with treatment, prevention may be the best strategy for dealing with this problem. Recent laboratory and clinical studies indicate that minimizing perioperative pain can suppress certain alterations in the nervous system that may prevent the genesis and maintenance of chronically painful conditions. This suggests that strategies for avoiding PTPS may begin with aggressive perioperative anesthetic and analgesic techniques. More effective application of knowledge already available from laboratory studies awaits further clinical trials. New drugs such as NMDA inhibitors hold promise for more effective treatment in the future."
CD008686,0,9740438,0,The use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection with electroejaculates from anejaculatory men.,"Electroejaculation has been successfully used for sperm procurement in anejaculatory men desiring fertility. However, electroejaculates typically have normal sperm numbers but poor motility, morphology, and functional deficiencies. Here we report the pregnancy outcome of a series of couples undergoing combined electroejaculation and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In all, 13 couples underwent a total of 18 cycles. The aetiologies of anejaculation included history of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for testicular cancers, spinal cord injury and psychogenic causes. ICSI was performed on 192 oocytes, resulting in a fertilization rate of 75.5%. A total of 15 embryo transfers were performed using a total of 51 embryos. Clinical pregnancy rate, as defined by positive fetal heart rate(s) using vaginal sonography, was 55.6% per retrieval; implantation rate was 33.3% per embryo. These rates appear to be similar to those obtained in standard IVF for non-male factor infertility, or ICSI for male factor infertility. The use of ICSI for electroejaculates undoubtedly provides these couples with the highest chance of pregnancy."

Some studies have suggested an analgesic effect after systemic clonidine administration. The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic effects of intrathecal and IV clonidine with acute noxious stimulation and with hyperalgesia from intradermal capsaicin injection in volunteers. Sixteen healthy volunteers received intradermal injections of capsaicin (100 microg) before and after the IV or intrathecal injection of clonidine 50 or 150 microg in a randomized, double-blind manner. Pain and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were determined at specified intervals. In addition, pain to noxious heat stimulation was determined. The capsaicin injection produced pain, followed by hyperalgesia and allodynia. The intrathecal, but not IV, injection of 150 microg of clonidine reduced capsaicin-induced pain and area of hyperalgesia. Intrathecal clonidine (150 microg) reduced pain to heat stimulation, whereas IV clonidine did not. The groups did not differ in hemodynamic or sedative effects from clonidine. These data support the value of intraspinal administration of clonidine for the treatment of acute pain and of pain states associated with hyperalgesia. Similarly, they suggest that analgesia from the systemic administration of this alpha2-adrenergic agonist, if any, is weak in doses that produce sedation and reduce blood pressure."

CD008686,0,9685948,0,"Biodegradable polyanhydride devices of cefazolin sodium, bupivacaine, and taxol for local drug delivery: preparation, and kinetics and mechanism of in vitro release.","The overall objective was to design and evaluate biodegradable implants for local drug delivery in clinical conditions and/or diseases described below, which are currently treated with systemic administration of drugs. Local delivery of cefazolin is desired in conditions such as osteomyelitis, soft-tissue infection and for prevention of post-surgical infections. Similarly, implanting a biodegradable device loaded with taxol in the cavity created by tumor resection will provide high local concentrations of taxol killing the malignant cells which may have survived the surgery, thus preventing metastasis and regrowth of the tumor and also prevent the systemic side effects of taxol. Prolonged reversible nerve blockade required in a number of clinical situations involving acute or chronic pain such as post-surgical pain following herniorrhaphy and thoracotomy can be achieved with local delivery of bupivacaine. Therefore, disk-shaped implants of polyanhydride, P(FAD-SA, 50:50 w/w), loaded with 10% w/w of cefazolin sodium, taxol and bupivacaine were prepared and evaluated for content uniformity and in vitro release characteristics for the above mentioned local drug delivery applications. All of cefazolin sodium was released in 14 days while 90% bupivacaine was released in 35 days. In striking contrast, taxol was released very slowly, and only 15% taxol was released in 77 days. The overall release appeared to be following first order kinetics, and the initial linear profile was fitted to zero order kinetics to obtain release parameters. Since cefazolin is highly water soluble and bupivacaine is moderately water soluble, compared to taxol which is extremely lipophilic, the aqueous solubility of the incorporated drug appeared to influence in release characteristics. Very good correlation was observed between release parameters (Ao, ko) and the solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) of drugs suggesting that the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of the drug influences its release from polyanhydride devices. Since polyanhydrides are believed to undergo pure surface erosion, release of the incorporated drug should be independent of its physicochemical properties, however the results presented in this study suggest otherwise. Therefore, P(FAD-SA, 50:50 w/w) may not be undergoing surface erosion, and the diffusion and dissolution properties of the drug in addition to erosion characteristics of the polyanhydride appear to play a role in drug release. Implants prepared and evaluated in this study released cefazolin, bupivacaine and taxol for a prolonged duration of time; however, depending upon the desired duration of release, an appropriate polyanhydride will have to be selected. For example, taxol was released so slowly that a more hydrophilic polyanhydride may have to be selected to release all the drug in a shorter period of time to be of any therapeutic use. Cefazolin implants released the drug for a sufficient duration for osteomyelitis and soft-tissue infection but the release was more prolonged than required for prevention of post-surgical wound infection."
CD008686,0,9684959,0,Osteoid osteoma of the lateral mass of C5. Should excision be combined with fusion?,"A 10-year-old girl presented with a 1-year history of pain and stiffness in her neck associated with left shoulder and arm pain. This was found to be caused by an osteoid osteoma of the lateral mass of C5. Surgical excision of the tumour was performed through a posterior approach. Following surgery, the patient's pre-operative pain resolved. However, 3 months later she developed a recurrence of neck pain secondary to cervical instability. Further investigation revealed a grade II spondylolisthesis at the C5/6 level. A combined anterior and posterior fusion was performed and the patient's instability pain rapidly resolved. At her 18-months' follow-up a solid fusion was confirmed radiologically and the patient remained asymptomatic with no evidence of tumour recurrence. The purpose of this report is to highlight the difficulty in diagnosing this condition as well as to emphasise the surgical technique required. It would appear that excision of the lateral mass will result in instability. To prevent this, fusion of the spine should always be considered at the time of surgical excision of the tumour."
CD008686,0,9678610,0,Pharmacological treatment of cancer pain: alternative routes of opioid administration.,"Cancer-related pain is present in 51% of patients at various stages of the disease, and the incidence increases up to 74% in advanced and terminal stages. The World Health Organization proposed and issued very simple guidelines for the pharmacologic treatment of cancer-related pain. According to the guidelines, opioid analgesics are the mainstay of analgesic therapy, and the first choice for drug administration is considered to be the oral route. However, in some clinical situations, the oral route is not feasible, and analgesic drugs consequently have to be administered via an alternative route. For example, this is the case when the patient presents vomiting, bowel obstruction, severe dysphagia, mental confusion and when the opioid dose has to be increased drastically in order to achieve adequate pain control. This review of the literature is aimed at describing the indications, the limits and the main aspects of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics relative to the alternative routes of administration of opioids most commonly used in clinical practice. Sublingual, rectal, subcutaneous, intravenous, transdermal and spinal administration routes are examined."
CD008686,0,9672008,0,Cervical spinal meningioma with unusual MR contrast enhancement.,A 16-year-old girl had progressive neck pain and weakness in the left hand. MR images showed a dumbbell-shaped spinal tumor with a prominently enhancing intradural component and a minimally enhancing extradural component. Pathologic examination revealed a meningioma with an intradural transitional component and an extradural syncytial component. The tumor showed no significant cystic change or necrosis.
CD008686,0,9670385,0,Chronic gastrointestinal problems and bowel dysfunction in patients with spinal cord injury.,"Amongst complications arising from spinal cord injury (SCI), chronic gastrointestinal (G-I) problems and bowel dysfunction have not received as much research attention as many other medical and rehabilitation problems, even although their incidence is not negligible. We therefore investigated chronic G-I problems and bowel dysfunction in SCI patients where the degree of these was such that activities of daily living (ADL) were significantly affected and/or long-term medical management was required. Detailed semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 72 traumatic SCI patients. The history of SCI was longer than 6 months, bowel habits had settled, and neurological recovery was completed. The incidence of chronic G-I problems was very high (62.5%), most were associated with defecation difficulties such as severe constipation, difficult with evacuation, pain associated with defecation, or urgency with incontinence. These problems had an extensive impact on ADL, and in particular, restricted diet (80%), restricted outdoor ambulation (64%) and caused unhappiness with bowel care (62%). Bowel care was performed once per 2.85 +/- 1.96 days and occupied an average of 42.1 +/- 28.7 min. To improve bowel habits, 43% of the patients took oral medication, and 36.1% controlled their diet. The usual methods of bowel care were anal massage (34.7%), unaided self-defecation with or without oral medication and abdominal massage (29.2%), finger enema (18.1%), rectal suppository (15.2%) and in two patients a colostomy tube had been inserted because of rectal cancer and traumatic colorectal injury. These chronic G-I symptoms were vague and very subjective, but significant enough to affect the quality of life. Bowel dysfunction was not related to age, duration of, or the neurological level of injury, ASIA score of ADL level, and bowel habits had generally settled within 6 months of SCI. With regard to frequency, time, and method of defection, bowel care habits varied considerably amongst individuals, and in relation to the extent to which practical results matched the level of expectation generated by physicians' recommended care program. Individual satisfaction was also very subjective. We therefore suggest that during the early stage of rehabilitation, an appropriate bowel program should be properly designed and adequate training provided."
CD008686,0,9669717,0,Case of the month: March 1998--48 year old man with back pain and weakness.,"A 48 year old man with long history of end stage renal disease (ESRD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism presented with back pain and incontinence. MRI and CT showed T2 expansion with bony destruction and spinal cord compression. Other vertebral bodies showed destructive lesions as well. Microscopic examination showed a brown tumor composed of multinucleated giant cells and bone uninvolved by tumor showed ""tunneling"" resorption. Brown tumors are an exaggerated form of ""local"" osteitis fibrosa cystica in patients with ESRD and secondary hyperparathyroidism, but spinal cord compression is rare."
CD008686,0,9664583,0,Spinal cord stimulation revisited.,"The proportion of patients with intractable pain successfully managed with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) remains disputed. We analyze 27 consecutive patients with intractable pain treated with SCS using identical hardware (Itrel II System; Medtronic Neurological, Inc Minneapolis, MN, USA) by a single satisfactory diagnosis 1992 through 1995. A rigid selection protocol was used: 1. A satisfactory diagnosis of the pathologic process resulting in pain was made. 2. A corrective surgical procedure was judged not feasible by surgeons experienced in the particular pathology, e.g., vascular peripheral nerve, spine. 3. Lack of satisfactory response to noninterventional pain management modalities by an interdisciplinary pain clinic. 4. Independent psychological evaluation, including a structured interview was performed by a psychologist specialized in chronic pain management. In the last eight cases, a battery of self-report tests designed to assess psychosocial and behavioral consequences of the chronic pain problem were administered as well. All cases were of nonmalignant pain, except for one patient. Thirteen cases were diagnosed with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), one older patient with lumbosacral radiculopathy who refused decompression, one cervical radiculopathy and Klippel-Feil syndrome, six with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), two with peripheral vascular ischemic disease, one with post-thoracotomy pain syndrome, one with leg pain following resection of angiolipoma, one with traumatic superficial peroneal neuropathy, and one with Pancoast's tumor. Fifteen patients were female and twelve were male. All were Caucasian. Their ages ranged from 27 to 84 years (mean:48). The average follow-up was 21 months (range: 48-6). All patients underwent a three day trial screening with Pisces-Quad/Resume epidural leads connected to a temporary external stimulator. An Itrel II System pulse-generator was internalized in each of the 24 patients who had successful trial (three cervical and twenty-one thoracic-lumbar). There was no morbidity. Pain reduction was sustained in 22 out of the 24 patients who continue to use the stimulator. The same number would choose to receive in an electrical stimulator again. Normalization or improvement in Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (Q-SART) and Thermography was documented in the patients with RSD. We conclude that rigid selection protocol can maximize the proportion of patients with intractable pain who are successfully treated with SCS. Strict neurosurgical technique eliminates infection risk. Hardware selection minimizes incidence of malfunction."
CD008686,0,9662105,0,Sudden death in an adolescent boy due to a colloid cyst of the third ventricle.,"A 13-year-old boy died suddenly at night while asleep. A colloid cyst filled the third ventricle, obstructed the flow of cerebral spinal fluid, and led to prominent hydrocephalus. Acute ventricular distension with brain herniation resulted in death, whereas repeated previous episodes had led to cerebral compression and edema. Complaints included only episodic headache in the month prior to death. His pediatrician prescribed a course of Imitrex (sumatriptan) because of lack of neurologic signs or other symptoms and a family history of migraine headaches. The headaches persisted, however, and within 1 month the patient died. The difficulty of accurate clinical diagnosis in this case is common. Subtle signs or even lack of symptoms of increased intracranial pressure may prevent a timely diagnosis before the occurrence of deadly complications. This case report helps to remind both forensic medical examiners and clinicians that this entity, although rare, should remain in the differential diagnosis of headache in children and young adults and of hydrocephalus at autopsy. Timely diagnosis of this benign lesion can lead to a surgical cure."
CD008686,0,9661547,0,"Overnight hospitalization after radical prostatectomy: the impact of two clinical pathways on patient satisfaction, length of hospitalization, and morbidity.","Changes in health care have prompted efforts to reduce length of hospitalization while maintaining quality care. Therefore, we evaluated short-term outcomes after radical retropubic prostatectomy on 100 consecutive men undergoing surgery for clinically localized prostate cancer performed under epidural anesthesia followed by epidural morphine or combined with spinal anesthesia using bupivacaine and fentanyl (25 micrograms) and followed by i.m. methadone (10-20 mg). All patients received oral acetaminophen and ibuprofen beginning 4 h after surgery. Length of hospital stay, responses to written satisfaction survey, postoperative morbidity and readmission to the hospital were recorded. Using either pathway, 83% of the patients were discharged after one night in the hospital. The mean hospital stay was 1.34 +/- 1.10 and 1.28 +/- 1.0 days, respectively. Although three men were rehospitalized, it was not because of the early discharge. More than 95% of patients were satisfied with pain control, and patients discharged after one night were not more likely to be dissatisfied than patients hospitalized longer."

Clinical symptoms were dominated by loin pain (100%), haematuria (45.4%), lumbar mass (72.7%), fever (18%). In one woman, AML was associated with ""tuberous sclerosis"". Preoperatively, the diagnosis was established by ultrasound and CT scan in 45.4% of patients. The size of the tumour varied from 7 to 14 cm in 10 patients and in one patient was only about 3.6 cm. Two women had bilateral tumours. Treatment consisted of total nephrectomy in 7 patients, partial nephrectomy in 3 patients and tumourectomy in one patient. The purpose of this study is to analyse the epidemiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of this disease."
CD008686,0,9657026,0,[Cancer of the kidney in adults. Apropos of 60 cases].,"The authors report a series of 60 cases of renal cancer observed over a 10-year period. Patients consisted of 35 women (58%) and 25 men (42%), with a mean age of 52 years (range: 21-72 years). The clinical features were polymorphic, dominated by loin pain (76%), haematuria (75%), a lumbar mass (46%), alteration of the general state (30%). The diagnosis was established by ultrasonography in 58 patients and CT scan in 38 patients. The mean tumour diameter was 11.5 cm (5-25 cm) and two cases presented bilateral tumours. The tumour was located in the upper pole in 40% of cases and was mid-renal in 30% of cases. The time to diagnosis ranged from 2 months to 3 years. Staging reflected the advanced stage of the cancer. Treatment was surgical for 53 patients (88%). A lumbar incision was generally performed (83%). The surgical procedure consisted of nephrectomy and regional or hilar lymph node dissection. Nephrectomy was simple for 27% of patients, radical for 69% of patients and partial for 4% of patients. The postoperative course was marked by one death due to pulmonary embolism, and a stercoral fistula in 2 patients. Histological examination of the specimen showed clear cell adenocarcinoma in 92% of cases. The tumour weight was often considerable, with a maximum of 3.750 kg. The lymph nodes removed were invaded in 50% of cases. The mean follow-up was 46 months (12 to 120 months). Follow-up was normal at 3 years for 23 patients (43%) and at 10 years for 4 patients (8%). Tumour recurrence in the renal compartment was observed in 3 patients after 3 years. Asynchronous metastases occurred in 10 patients (23%). The mean interval to metastases was 20 months (4 to 36 months)."

In January 1995, she noted swelling in the left parotid gland, and saw an otorhinolaryngologist. Needle biopsy showed small cell carcinoma, and she was subsequently admitted to our hospital. Chest radiography revealed a tumor shadow in the hilus of the right lung. Bronchial biopsy revealed small cell carcinoma of the lung (T 4 N 3 M 1, stage IV). Chemotherapy, with a CDDP-VP-16 regimen, achieved no response. She later developed bitemporal hemianopsia and abducens nerve palsy. Brain MRI revealed metastasis in the pituitary gland. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were efficacious for only a few months. She also developed pain and numbness in the left leg, attributable to intramedullary metastasis (L 1/2, L 4/5) shown on MRI. It is extremely rare for a metastasis to the parotid gland to be the initial clinical manifestation of a small cell lung cancer which later develops widespread metastases to the pituitary gland and lumbar spinal cord."

CD008686,0,9647432,0,One-year chromaffin cell allograft survival in cancer patients with chronic pain: morphological and functional evidence.,"The control of chronic pain through transplantation of chromaffin cells has been reported over the past few years. Analgesic effects are principally due to the production of opioid peptides and catecholamines by chromaffin cells. Clinical trials have been reported with allografts consisting of whole-tissue fragments implanted into the subarachnoid space of the lumbar spinal cord (14,19,36). In the present study, allogeneic grafts were successfully used to control chronic pain in two patients over a period of 1 yr based on patient reported pain scores, morphine intake, and CSF levels of Met-enkephalin. Macroscopic examination at autopsy located the transplanted tissue fragments in the form of multilobulated nodules at the level of the spinal axis and cauda equina. Immunocytochemical microscopy showed neuroendocrine cells are positive for chromagranin A (CGA), and enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DbetaH). The results suggest that there is a relationship between analgesic effect, Met-enkephalin levels in CSF, and the presence of chromaffin cells surviving in spinal subarachnoid space."

CD008686,0,9618579,0,Comparison of bone single-photon emission tomography and planar imaging in the detection of vertebral metastases in patients with back pain.,"Bone scan has long been considered to be an important diagnostic test in searching for bone metastases. However, considerable difficulty is encountered in the vertebral region due to the complexity of structures and the fact that other benign lesions, especially degenerative changes, are very common there. Single-photon emission tomography (SPET) has been reported to be useful in the differentiation of benign from malignant conditions. Here we report our experience with bone SPET in the diagnosis of vertebral metastases. This is a retrospective study of technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scans in 174 consecutive patients who were referred for the investigation of back pain in our department. MDP planar and SPET images were obtained. Of teh 174 patients, 98 had a known history of malignant tumours. The diagnosis of vertebral metastasis was made on the basis of the patients' clinical histories and the findings with other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography or follow-up bone scan. We found that the presence of pedicle involvement as seen on SPET was an accurate diagnostic criterion of vertebral metastasis. SPET had a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 82%, a negative predictive value of 94% and an accuracy of 90%. On the other hand, planar study had a sensitivity of 74%, a specificity of 81%, a positive predictive value of 64%, a negative predictive value of 88% and an accuracy of 79% in diagnosing vertebral metastasis. Except with regard to the negative predictive value, SPET performed statistically better than planar imaging. Only 9/147 (6.4%) lesions involving the vertebral body alone and 3/49 (6.1%) lesions involving facet joints alone were subsequently found to be metastases. We conclude that bone SPET is an accurate diagnostic test for the detection of vertebral metastases and is superior to planar imaging in this respect."

Eighty-six children were enrolled. LPs were performed with use of 22-gauge spinal needles with the bevel oriented parallel to the long axis of the spine. Follow-up telephone interviews and patients' diary of symptoms were collected. Headache brought on by sitting up and relieved by lying down was defined as PDPH. Of the 80 who completed the study, six (8%) developed PDPH. Two (3%) were less than 6 years old and four (5%) were 6 to 12 years of age. Children with a history of headache following a previous LP were nine times as likely to experience PDPH. PDPH occurs not infrequently in children. A prior history of headache is a predisposing factor."

The PA diagnosed in the authors' center over a period of 91 months are presented, analyzing the main clinical features, microbiologic causal agents, risk factors, treatment and the differences between primary and secondary PA. A total of 19 cases of which 14 were secondary PA (73.7%) and 5 primary PA (26.3%) were diagnosed. The main foci of infection of the former were the bone and the genitourinary tract, with intestinal infection being rare. The most frequent clinical data were lumbar pain with possible irradiation to the lower limb, fever, and leucocytosis with neutrophilia. Gram negative and enteric anaerobes were the bacteria most often identified, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In a high percentage of patients (57.8%) a history of immunodeficiency was reported. In regard to treatment, surgical drainage was performed in 5 cases (26.3%), while ten cases (52.6%) were treated by DPCT. Four patients (21%) were exclusively treated with antibiotics. Recurrence was observed in three cases (15.3%) of the DPCT group requiring new drainage. Of all the cases, 18 were cured while one death occurred, being attributed to the underlying tumoral disease of advanced stage. The authors believe DPCT to be a good therapeutic option in both primary and secondary PA, thereby avoiding the risks of major surgery. In the cases with no underlying immunodeficiency the existence of secondary PA should be discarded as occurred in 7 out of 8 cases with no history of immunodeficiency in this series of patients."
CD008686,0,9609523,0,Failure of oral pamidronate to reduce skeletal morbidity in multiple myeloma: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Danish-Swedish co-operative study group.,"In order to study whether oral bisphosphonate therapy might prevent or reduce skeletal-related morbidity in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who required chemotherapy, 300 patients were included in a randomized multi-centre trial. Patients were given oral pamidronate at a dose of 300 mg daily, or placebo, in addition to conventional intermittent melphalan/prednisolone (and in some cases alpha-interferon) treatment. With a median treatment duration of about 550d, no statistically significant reduction in skeletal-related morbidity (defined as bone fracture, related surgery, vertebral collapse, or increase in number and/or size of bone lesions) could be demonstrated. Pamidronate treatment also did not have any influence on patient survival or on the frequency of hypercalcaemia. However, in patients treated with pamidronate there were fewer episodes of severe pain (P=0.02) and a decreased reduction of body height of 1.5 cm (P= 0.02). The overall negative result of the study is attributed to the very low absorption of orally administered bisphosphonates in general."
CD008686,0,9608617,0,Perils and pointers in the evaluation and management of back pain.,"This article examines the current treatment of low back pain in light of the recent Agency for Health Care Practice and Research (AHCPR) guidelines on the acute management of low back pain (the AHCPR is an agency of the federal government). The article describes the most important history questions, the most helpful physical signs, and the most practical examination techniques. Considerable emphasis is placed on ruling out the ""red flag"" diagnoses that require immediate treatment. The article agrees with the AHCPR that if the red flags of cancer, infection, fracture, and neurologic deficit are ruled out, most of the remaining causes of acute back pain are largely self-healing over 4-8 weeks. Emphasis is placed on using the history and physical examination rather than expensive studies to rule out the red flag cases, so that cost-effective management of low back pain is possible. The author also reviews the ten top causes of low back pain and their evaluation and treatment."

Fourteen females and 10 males aged 36-72 years with femoral (18 cases), tibial (4 cases) or humeral (2 cases) involvement were followed-up for 6-48 months. In 12 patients the pain ceased or decreased, 3 patients occasionally required non narcotic analgesics, in 9 cases the pain continued. All patients with lower extremity involvement were able to ambulate with an aid of walking sticks, 2 patients with humeral fracture resumed activities of daily living. Nine patients with multiple metastases to the lungs and spine died on average 15 months after surgery. The longest survival rate was found in patients with kidney cancer-19 months, ovary cancer-17 months and breast cancer 15 months. No postoperative complications were found. In 2 patients fracture fixation lost their stability after 8 and 10 weeks due to excessive weight bearing."

Open biopsies showed only callus formation. The patient responded clinically to conservative measures, with twice-repeated follow-up Tc-99m MDP and MR scans documenting resolution of transient bone marrow oedema. We suggest that this form of marrow oedema represents a variant pattern of sacral insufficiency fractures."

CD008686,0,9577404,0,Fibrodysplasia (myositis) ossificans progressiva. Clinical lessons from a rare disease.,"Fibrodysplasia (myositis) ossificans progressiva is a rare dominantly inherited disorder, in which defects in skeletal patterning particularly affecting the big toes, are associated with progressive endochondral ossification of the large striated muscles in a specific order leading to prolonged disability. A recent series of 28 patients studied for as many as 24 years exemplifies the presentation and course of this disease. Painful swelling of muscles (myositis) leading to ossification began at a mean age of 4.6 years (range, 0-16 years) initially in the neck and upper spine (in 25 subjects) and later around the hips, other major joints, and jaw. The rate and extent of disability was unrelated to the time of onset. No form of treatment produced consistent benefit. Despite the unique clinical features, the initial diagnosis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva was often wrong and usually considerably delayed. Mistaken histologic diagnoses such as soft tissue sarcoma or fibromatosis could lead to inappropriate treatment."
CD008686,0,9576264,0,Spinal dural enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging associated with spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Report of three cases and review of the literature.,"This report offers a description of typical changes seen on gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the entire spine that indicate spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of its kind. They describe three cases of SIH that were accompanied by dural enhancement throughout the neuraxis on imaging, with the evolution of associated subdural and epidural fluid collections in the spine. Recognition of this disorder is important to be able to distinguish it from an infectious or neoplastic process in which surgical intervention might be warranted. Evaluation using gadolinium-enhanced cranial and spinal MR imaging in patients with postural headaches and an (111)In-labeled cerebrospinal fluid leak study are discussed. Treatment with an epidural blood patch is shown to be particularly effective, with resolution of the radiological and clinical findings."
CD008686,0,9576262,0,Spinal epidural cavernous hemangiomas. Report of three cases and review of the literature.,"Epidural cavernous hemangiomas are increasingly identified as a cause of acute or chronic progressive spinal cord syndrome and local back pain or radiculopathy. The authors present three cases of spinal epidural cavernous hemangiomas manifesting as spinal cord syndrome, thoracic radiculopathy, and lumbar radiculopathy. Based on the imaging characteristics of these three cases and a review of the literature, the clinical signs and symptoms and their implications, the role of preoperative neuroradiological diagnosis, and the need for complete surgical resection are discussed. Epidural cavernous hemangiomas display consistent magnetic resonance imaging properties: T1-weighted images most commonly show a homogeneous signal intensity similar to those of spinal cord and muscle, and contrast enhancement is homogeneous or slightly heterogeneous. On T2-weighted images the signal of the lesion is consistently high and slightly less intense than that of cerebrospinal fluid. Frequently, the lesion is characterized by its extension through the intervertebral foramen. Awareness of these characteristics facilitates diagnosis and treatment of the lesions. Despite the risk of bleeding, in all three cases complete surgical excision was achieved."

CD008686,0,9567207,0,Update on clinical trials in the rheumatic diseases.,"Therapeutic trials in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, seronegative spondyloarthopathies, back pain, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis are reviewed. For RA, minocycline has been proven effective in some subsets of RA, whereas tumor necrosis factor receptor IgG fusion protein appears quite effective for treating the symptoms of RA in a more resistant group. The latter trial illustrates the importance of tumor necrosis factor in RA. Also, the triple combination of hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and methotrexate is very effective even in resistant RA. In osteoarthritis, the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular steroids, and biologics are reviewed, with generally nondifferentiable nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug effects and some short-term intra-articular effects of new biologics. Sulfasalazine is moderately effective for ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis, although the large placebo response in the latter makes it more difficult to show responses. Trials in the treatment of back pain are beginning to be published, with a large cohort study over 1 year favoring surgery for early relief of pain in both sciatica and lumbar stenosis, but not showing a clear advantage in functional outcome at 1 year. Finally, early reports show the ability of dihydroepiandrosterone to decrease steroid use in systemic lupus erythematosus, whereas Relaxin appears to be effective in decreasing skin involvement in systemic sclerosis. These trials demonstrate in numerous ways the need to consider the elements of good trial design when testing therapeutic modalities in the rheumatic diseases. These key elements include 1) careful patient definition and selection; 2) removal of bias (requiring blinding, randomization, prospective studies, and often, placebo); 3) use of well-defined outcomes; and 4) careful analytic techniques."

Historical and physical findings are not helpful in identifying damaged tissues in patients with nonspecific low back pain. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines for plain radiographs in the evaluation of low back pain are too sensitive and expose patients unnecessarily to ionizing radiation. Clinical entities reviewed in the literature include septic sacroiliitis, prognosis of metastatic spinal tumors, and low back pain in health care professionals. Epidural corticosteroid injections are useful for leg pain and sensory deficits early in the course of sciatica secondary to a herniated nucleus pulposus. Poor nutritional state increases the risk for postoperative infections for spinal fusion patients."
CD008686,0,9563127,0,[Therapy of hormone refractory prostatic carcinoma].,In patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer primary androgen deprivation eventually fails. The begin of secondary treatment is depending on clinical symptoms; since survival cannot be prolonged in progressive disease improvement of quality of life is of paramount importance. Altering of endocrine treatment and antiandrogen withdrawal can cause a transient improvement of the sense of well being. Single agent chemotherapy with little side effects should be preferred as compared with polychemotherapy since response rates do not exceed 30%. Although 2/3 of the patients benefit from chemotherapy there is however no proof that it is superior to symptom-related pain relief. The indication for surgical management such as TURP and spinal cord decompression is depending on clinical symptoms from local progression and systemic disease.

[1986, Am J Med Genet 25:441-443]. Three members (patients IV-2, IV-18, and IV-19) have developed pigmentary changes in the retina and paleness of the optic disk. Patient IV-18 also has developed giant hypertrophy of the labia minora that, when examined histopathologically, was found to be due to neoplastic fibroblast and epithelial proliferation caused by a fibromatous process similar to that reported in the gingivae of the patients with this syndrome. Audiologic function of patient IV-2 was normal, and no skin lesions were detected. The articular signs and symptoms show that the affected relatives developed rheumatoid arthritis, which is currently inactive in patient IV-18, whereas patient IV-2 did not develop these alterations."

Our experience treating three women with lupus TM within a few months is presented. In each patient, spinal cord dysfunction was accompanied by laboratory or clinical evidence of SLE. Further neurologic manifestations, such as optic neuritis, developed in all patients, suggesting other diagnoses, including multiple sclerosis (MS), Devic's syndrome, and lupoid sclerosis. The outcomes for these three women were severe disability, death, and moderate disability, respectively. The severity of outcome did not seem to correlate with the timing or intensity of treatment. Physiatrists should be aware of the potential for neurologic progression in lupus TM, because patients with this condition invariably require rehabilitation."

Cervical MRI revealed a herniated disc Cv-Cvi, for which the patient was treated surgically. However, the pain persisted. In retrospect, the axillary numbness could not have been caused by a Cv-Cvi problem, because C6 does not innervate the axilla. Repeated MRI, now of the cervicothoracic region, revealed a tumourous process around TI-TII. Thoracotomy was performed and a mesothelioma was found. The patient died shortly afterwards. It is stressed that the diagnostic satisfaction of a positive MRI finding should not lead to disregarding discrepancies between these radiological results and the clinical findings."
CD008686,0,9548526,0,Diffuse infiltrating astrocytoma of the cervicomedullary region: clinicopathologic entity.,"Recent imaging and neurosurgical techniques have led to an improvement in the surgical management of children with brainstem tumors (BSTs). Many children with tumors previously considered 'inoperable' can now benefit from surgery. Increased experience has brought about new theories concerning the growth pattern, natural history, classification and optimal management of these tumors. Cervicomedullary (CM) tumors commonly have an indolent presentation reflecting either medullary or cervical spinal cord dysfunction and tend to arise in the upper cervical cord growing into the medulla in a posterior exophytic fashion. Intrinsic BSTs often present acutely with cranial nerve dysfunction and generally arise in the pons with a diffuse infiltrating growth pattern. A 21-month-old patient had developed feeding difficulty and reactive airway disease at approximately 8 months of age. MRI showed a diffuse, nonenhancing tumor in the CM region. Following radical resection, and an unremarkable perioperative course, he aspirated, developed pulmonary insufficiency and expired. Postmortem examination revealed a low-grade diffuse fibrillary astrocytoma extending from C6 to the medulla. The medullary portion arose in a paramedian location and infiltrated dorsally into the fourth ventricle, the obex, the leptomeninges, and the adjacent cerebellum. This case demonstrates the growth pattern of a distinct subset of CM tumors that behave in a manner similar to intrinsic diffuse BST. Future identification of these subsets by a careful analysis of the clinical presentation and MRI images will enable better operative planning and optimal management."

CD008686,0,9540137,0,Scientific evidence and research in primary care.,"The key areas of scientific research in general internal medicine are (1) prevention; (2) the natural history of common illnesses; (3) improving the outcomes and efficiency of the health care system and (4) orphan diseases. Disease prevention is at the top of the list because of the enormous role preventable causes play in morbidity and mortality, above all tobacco. Research in this field is difficult because it touches such questions as individual behaviour and personal choice. Research in the natural history of common illnesses is critical to informed patient decision making. Recent studies show that procedures thought to be safe bear a high percentage of complications, when viewed from the generalist's point of view: high incidence of strokes after elective coronary bypass surgery; higher mortality rates among patients having had pulmonary catheterization; high incidence of incontinence and impotence after transurethral resection of the prostate. A third area for research in primary care is how to improve outcome and efficiency through improvements in the health care delivery system. This field touches the problem of unnecessary surgical interventions and inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. Orphan diseases in this context are conditions no speciality wants to study, such as dementia and low back pain. The most important obstacle for research in the field of general internal medicine is funding. It is much easier to be funded for research in high profile conditions, like heart disease, cancer and AIDS. A second barrier to research relates to the role of special interest groups in influencing not only funding but also policy. Important examples were the pressure on consensus conference decisions on the role of spinal fusion surgery for low back pain and on the question whether women between 40 and 50 should have annual mammography. For generalist research to be fruitful it is of outmost importance to have an adequate intellectual infrastructure, i.e. support by epidemiologists, biostatisticians, economists and research methodologists."

The lesion was situated within the subcutaneous fat. Clinically and radiologically, this mass was considered to be a subcutaneous venous haemangioma. Histological examination of the excised mass showed a diffuse neurofibroma with ectatic vessels and entrapped adipose tissue.

CD008686,0,9524905,0,Subcutaneous morphine is superior to intrathecal morphine for pain control in a patient with hypernephroma.,"This case report illustrates differences in analgesia quality and morphine consumption between an intrathecal infusion and the subcutaneous instillation of morphine in a cancer patient with hypernephroma. Superior analgesia was obtained with a 450 mg dose of subcutaneous morphine [i.e., visual analog scale (VAS) score 0/10] than with 10 mg intrathecal morphine/day administered at the thoracolumbar (twelfth dorsal vertebra) level (VAS score 2/10). If the instillation occurs at the lumbosacral level (between the last lumbar and the first sacral vertebra), a dosage of 70 mg morphine/day cannot induce the same pain relief as 450 mg subcutaneous morphine (VAS score 5/10 vs. 0/10). In some cancer patients, subcutaneous morphine offers superior pain control than intrathecal morphine."
CD008686,0,9515543,0,SPET and three-phase planar bone scintigraphy in adult patients with chronic low back pain.,"Among adults, low back pain (LBP) persisting for more than 3 months is a common complaint. A variety of imaging modalities including bone scintigraphy have been recommended as appropriate for the investigation of chronic LBP, even when there is no reason to suspect that the pain is due to tumour, infection or inflammatory arthritis. In this chronic LBP population, the diagnostic benefit of bone SPET, together with planar flow study, blood pool and delayed three-phase imaging, was assessed, Altogether, 2108 consecutive adult patients were entered into the chronic LBP bone scintigraphy database. Retrospective exclusion of patients with a history of tumour, infection or inflammatory arthritis reduced the population to 1390, of whom 916 underwent a lumbosacral spine flow study and blood pool imaging in addition to planar and SPET bone scintigraphy. The diagnostic benefit of these imaging studies was tabulated and compared. In addition, a retrospective chart review of the patients with renal and other soft tissue abnormalities identified by a flow study and blood pool imaging was undertaken with a view to documenting any changes in treatment planning over the 6 months following the nuclear medicine studies. Of the lumbosacral spine abnormalities, 44.1% were seen equally well on planar and SPET images, 24.0% better on SPET, 31.4% only seen on SPET, and 0.4% only seen on planar imaging. The distribution of abnormalities identified on SPET images in the lumbar spine was divided between vertebral bodies (36.1%), lamina or pedicles (which included frequent sites of increased uptake in the articular facets and pars interarticularis) (53.8%), spinous processes (8.7%) and transverse processes (1.3%). For the flow study and blood pool imaging, there was a 16.7% rate of positive studies. However, there were no documented changes in treatment planning because of these positive findings. In conclusion, when used to examine adult patients with chronic LBP, SPET detects significantly more scintigraphic abnormalities than planar imaging. The addition of a flow study and blood pool imaging as part of these LBP examinations results in a significant benefit. However, the clinical utility of such flow study and blood pool imaging studies cannot be confirmed."
CD008686,0,9509254,0,Chronic pain.,"Chronic pain is an emotional experience and is defined as pain lasting greater than six months. It is important to understand the neurophysiology of pain in order to treat it. Nociceptors in the periphery travel to the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord while secondary and tertiary afferents transmit information from the dorsal horn to the brain. Modification of pain information may take place in these ascending pathways or in descending pathways. Treatment of chronic pain is most successful when it is approached in a multidisciplinary fashion with the focus not only on treatment of underlying etiology, but also on the secondary impacts of pain on the patient's life. The management of chronic pain requires special expertise. Most of the experts in chronic pain assessment and management organize themselves into pain treatment centers. These centers vary widely in their approach to the problem. The most sophisticated is a multidisciplinary center that is university-based and includes teaching and research. Treatment of chronic pain includes a variety of medications, psychological support, and rehabilitation. Multidisciplinary pain management is also an integral part of the palliative care and hospice concept used to treat cancer pain."

CD008686,0,9488619,0,A randomized trial of the effect of clodronate on skeletal morbidity in multiple myeloma. MRC Working Party on Leukaemia in Adults.,"In patients with multiple myeloma, despite a major reduction of bone pain achieved with chemotherapy, skeletal disease continues to progress. The effects of clodronate, an inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption, are evaluated on the natural history of skeletal disease in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Within the framework of the VIth MRC Multiple Myeloma Trial, 536 patients (218 women, 318 men) with recently diagnosed multiple myeloma were randomized to receive either clodronate 1600 mg daily (n=264) or an outwardly identical placebo (n=272) in addition to chemotherapy. Treatment with clodronate was associated with a 50% decrease in the proportion of patients with severe hypercalcaemia (5.1% v 10.1%, P=0.06) and a similar reduction in reported non-vertebral fractures (6.8% v 13.2%, P=0.04). Fewer patients receiving clodronate sustained vertebral fractures after entry to the trial (38% v 55%, P=0.01) and patients also lost less height over 3 years compared to those receiving placebo (2.0 v 3.4 cm, P=0.01). Biochemical indices of bone turnover were significantly lower in patients receiving concomitant clodronate, both at plateau and at disease relapse. The frequencies of back pain and poor performance status were significantly lower at 24 months in clodronate than in placebo-treated patients (10.9% v 19.9%, P=0.05, and 18.3% v 30.5% P=0.03 respectively.) There was no statistically significant difference in survival between the clodronate and placebo treated patients. The study indicates that long-term oral clodronate slows the progression of skeletal disease in multiple myeloma and decreases the associated morbidity. Patients without overt skeletal disease at diagnosis were also found to benefit from clodronate, indicating that this treatment should be initiated as early in the course of the disease as possible."
CD008686,0,9484367,0,Transverse myelitis. Comparison with spinal cord presentations of multiple sclerosis.,"We delineated the clinical and laboratory features that help distinguish acute myelopathic MS (MMS) from acute transverse myelitis (ATM), specifically testing the hypothesis that the symmetry of motor and sensory impairments at presentation can reliably distinguish between ATM and MMS. We reviewed 20 consecutive patients with ATM and 16 patients with MMS. Clinical criteria were used to assign patients to the ATM group. Patients assigned to the MMS group had onset of MS symptoms referable to the spinal cord and eventually fulfilled Poser's criteria for MS. The relative contribution of the symmetry of both motor and sensory symptoms for the accurate identification of ATM versus MMS was evaluated using a discriminant function analysis. Fifteen of 16 MMS patients and all 20 ATM patients presented with symptoms of motor dysfunction. Additionally, all patients in both groups presented with sensory complaints. MMS patients had asymmetric motor or sensory symptoms in all but one patient, whereas ATM patients exhibited symmetric weakness uniformly and symmetric sensory loss in all but one patient (statistically significant). None of the MS patients met criteria for ATM at presentation. None of the ATM patients developed MS over an average follow-up period of 4.5 years. In conclusion, MMS was easily distinguished from ATM in this study."

CD008686,0,9454313,0,[Current approach to low back pain].,"Despite advances in medical knowledge and available methods of treating spinal problems, the costs these problems generate are growing in a constant and exponential manner in western countries. Back pain is not different, commoner or more severe than in the past. This raises the question whether present-day management, which often runs counter to current scientific evidence, is appropriate. Practically speaking, so-called specific back pain is to be distinguished from nonspecific or common back pain. The former arises from a precise lesion (infectious, tumoral, inflammatory or traumatic), while the latter has no obvious underlying cause. Fortunately this preliminary differentiation is usually possible on the basis of the history and clinical workup alone. In this paper we deal solely with common back pain, as being by far the most frequent in everyday practice. Once a specific origin has been ruled out, the chief aim should be earliest possible resumption of the patient's normal activities. Various methods, embracing drug treatment, physiotherapy, and in appropriate cases ergotherapy, are available for this purpose. If this fails, the physician must react as rapidly as possible to prevent the condition becoming chronic. Regard should be had for the various psychosocial factors which interfere with the healing process, and a method should be adopted which is no longer based on the classic biomedical model but on a bio-psycho-social approach as proposed by Waddell. If necessary the patient should be referred to a specialist (rheumatologist, rehabilitation, orthopedist etc). Back pain is extremely widespread in the population at large and is a frequent reason why people consult a physician. On these grounds the primary care physician has a key role to play in the initial workup and also in the acute, subacute or chronic stage of the evolution. This review of the principles which should guide the practical approach to the back-pain patient is intended to aid the practitioner in his tasks of diagnosis and therapy."
CD008686,0,9451740,0,[Paraganglioma of the cauda equina].,"We report on a case of paraganglioma of the cauda equina in a 48-year-old man. These slow-growing, mostly benign and encapsulated intradural-extramedullar tumours are clinically characterized by lumbago, paraesthesia and motor deficits as well as occasionally by incontinence. Paragangliomas of the cauda equina show monomorphous (main) cells arranged in a typical cell cluster pattern, demonstrating a lobular architecture and a fine net of connective tissue formed by so-called sustentacular cells; some tumours show focal ganglionic differentiation. Because of their morphological similarity to the more common ependymomas, paragangliomas of the cauda equina are sometimes misdiagnosed so that their incidence is likely to be higher than previously estimated. Immunohistochemistry findings are positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and other neuronal markers as well as neuropeptides (main cells) and S-100 protein (sustentacular cells) while widely lacking reactivity for GFAP. Paragangliomas of the cauda equina represent a rare entity, of which only 80 cases have been described in the literature. Because they only occur sporadically, they are often not included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the region of the cauda equina."

CD008686,0,9444442,0,Paget's disease of bone: indications for treatment and goals of therapy.,"Paget's disease of bone is a common disorder of unknown etiology characterized by increased bone remodeling and abnormal bone architecture. The pathologic process is initiated by an increase in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, accompanied by a compensatory increase in bone formation. The increased bone remodeling results in a disorganized mosaic of woven and lamellar bone. This bone is highly vascular and gradually becomes enlarged and structurally weakened. Paget's disease is generally diagnosed in patients older than 40 years of age, usually as an incidental finding. The disease may be monostotic or polyostotic. The pelvis, femur, spine, tibia, skull, and humerus are most commonly involved. Most patients with Paget's disease are asymptomatic. Pain is the most common presenting symptom. Complications of the disease include bowing deformity of the long bones, fracture, and a variety of nerve compression syndromes. Malignant degeneration of Paget's disease is a rare complication. As safer, more effective therapies have become available, the indications for treatment and goals of therapy have changed. The difficult issue that clinicians are currently facing is whether to treat patients with asymptomatic disease. The progressive nature of the disease, the severity of its complications, its potential negative impact on quality of life, and the availability of therapy capable of controlling its activity have led many experts in the field to recommend treatment of asymptomatic patients who have active disease at sites where complications are likely to develop. There are, however, no data to prove that complications can be prevented by decreasing the rate of bone remodeling in Paget's disease, nor any data to define who is at risk for complications. Until more information is available, the management of patients with Paget's disease will continue to be based on clinical observation and theoretical considerations. This review examines the present understanding of Paget's disease, the rationale for the proposed indications for treatment and the goals of therapy."

One cyst was located in the thoracic spine, causing a transverse syndrome; 15 cysts were located in the lumbar spine, causing nerve root compression. Diagnosis was established preoperatively by MR in 10 and CT in 3 cases, respectively. The definite classification of the cystic processes was made by histopathologic examination. Surgical treatment consisted of resection of the cyst. Postoperatively, all but 2 patients were free of complaints and no recurrence was observed in the mean follow-up period of 15.5 months.

CD008686,0,9429945,0,Isolated metastases to the retina or optic nerve.,"Isolated metastases to the retina or optic nerve are extremely rare. Retinal metastases arise from cutaneous malignant melanoma and carcinomas (lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and breast). Most patients present with reduced vision. The clinical appearance of these metastases is variable. Melanoma metastases are brown or black, whereas carcinoma metastases are white. Frequently, retinal hemorrhages and exudates are seen. Optic nerve metastases arise from carcinomas (lung, breast, and gastrointestinal) in adults and acute leukemias in children. As is true of retinal metastases, most patients present with reduced vision. Though in most cases there is a visible optic nerve mass, some patients have optic disc edema only. Investigations are directed by a known history of malignancy in many patients and by physical examination. Cytological workup of vitreous may be required. Treatment options include observation, radiotherapy in eyes with visual potential, and enucleation for pain control. The visual prognosis is poor. In patients with retinal or optic nerve metastases, median survival is approximately 9 months after the onset of visual symptoms, but is slightly longer in cases in which the primary lesion is breast carcinoma."

A 30-year-old woman had a 2-month history of back pain, urinary incontinence, and bilateral lower extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed an intramedullary spinal cord tumor from T4 to T8 with an intramedullary cyst from T1 to T4. After thoracic decompressive surgery, findings from biopsy of the cord lesion were consistent with multiple sclerosis. Postoperatively, the patient required an intensive rehabilitation program. This is the first reported case of histopathologically confirmed spinal cord demyelination presenting as an intramedullary thoracic cord tumor.

CD008686,0,9362433,0,Bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma.,"The major clinical manifestations of multiple myeloma are related to enhanced bone destruction resulting in osteolytic lesions, osteoporosis, and pathologic fractures in most patients as well as hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression in many individuals. These patients frequently require radiation therapy or surgery. In an attempt to reduce these complications, bisphosphonates have been evaluated in several large randomized trials in patients also receiving chemotherapy. Oral etidronate given daily showed no clinical benefit, whereas the use of oral clodronate daily did reduce the development of new osteolytic lesions but did not significantly affect bone pain or rates of pathologic fractures. A large, randomized, double-blind study was conducted in which Stage III multiple myeloma patients received either pamidronate (90 mg) or placebo as a 4-hour infusion every 4 weeks for 21 cycles in addition to antimyeloma chemotherapy. The proportion of patients with at least one skeletal complication was significantly reduced in the pamidronate group compared with the placebo group. Although survival was not different between the pamidronate and placebo groups overall, patients in whom first-line chemotherapy had failed when they entered the trial lived longer with pamidronate treatment than those receiving placebo. Patients who received pamidronate had significant decreases in bone pain, had less analgesic drug use, and had better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status than patients receiving placebo.

CD008686,0,9362430,0,Radiation for bone metastases: conventional techniques and the role of systemic radiopharmaceuticals.,"Pain management often is difficult in patients with bone metastases. Metastatic disease represents >40% of oncologic practice, and >70% of patients with metastatic disease have uncontrolled cancer-related pain. Significant morbidity caused by pathologic fracture and spinal cord compression can result from untreated bone metastases. Representing both a manifestation of systemic disease as well as causing localized symptoms, bone metastases require a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach. Radiation therapy provides both localized and systemic treatment options in addition to chemohormonal therapies and surgery. External beam irradiation provides palliation in >70% of patients through tumor regression of a localized lesion. Systemic radiopharmaceuticals treat multifocal disease either alone or as an adjuvant to external beam irradiation. Efficient and comprehensive management of bone metastases is imperative because of the associated symptoms, prior therapies, complex underlying medical problems, and clinical presentations that often require emergent interventions. Intensification of pain may be observed with hormonal therapy and systemic radiopharmaceuticals. Symptomatic relief from antineoplastic therapies generally requires 4-12 weeks and may be related to reossification. Symptoms, occurring due to the disease and/or while awaiting response to therapy, must be aggressively managed. Persistent or recurrent pain after therapy may be due to bony instability or fracture before reossification occurs. An Interdisciplinary Bone Metastases Clinic, with representatives from Diagnostic Radiology, Medical Oncology, Nuclear Medicine, Orthopedic Surgery, Pain and Symptom Management, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and Radiation Oncology, was developed that allows coordinated evaluation, treatment, and symptom management of these complex clinical presentations."

Data from LPs were analyzed at the last procedure without EMLA (T1) and the first and last procedures with EMLA (T2 and T3). Friedman's nonparametric analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. A total of 272 procedures in 29 children were analyzed. For 179 procedures without EMLA, physicians rated pain lower than other raters, and for the 93 with EMLA physicians rated pain less than the children. Children rated pain at T2 lower than at T1 or T3. Physicians rated pain at T2 less than at T3. Both children and physicians rated pain at T3 as not different from that at T1. No differences were noted at these time points for other raters in LP distress ratings, or in bone marrow aspiration pain or distress ratings. Thus EMLA was associated with decreased pain ratings for LPs, but this effect was not sustainable with repeated procedures. The cream alone should not be relied on to control pain of bone marrow aspiration or repeated LPs in children. Physicians underestimated pain, which may have implications for undertreatment in this patient population."
CD008686,0,9340723,0,[Spinal accessory nerve and lymphatic neck dissection].,"Radical neck dissection was the golden standard of treatment for cervical nodes in head and neck tumors. From the seventies, the preservation of the spinal accessory nerve has become increasingly popular in order to improve the functional result of the neck dissections. The aim of this study was to assess the degree of functional disability associated with each type of neck dissection and the value of anatomical references for dissection of the spinal accessory nerve. One hundred twenty seven patients were evaluated 1 month and 1 year after radical, functional or supraomohyoid neck dissection with a questionnaire and a physical examination. Anatomical measurements of the spinal accessory nerve were performed in 20 patients. We found considerable or severe shoulder dysfunction in 7%, 34% and 51% respectively of patients in whom supraomohyoid, functional and radical neck dissections were performed. Furthermore 49% of patients having undergone a radical neck dissection had little or no symptoms. Sacrifice of the spinal accessory nerve in radical neck dissection may lead to shoulder dysfunction. A functional disability may also be associated, although in a less extent, with any neck dissection in which the spinal accessory nerve is dissected and placed in traction. There is a large variation in the degree of functional disability and pain in patients with similar neck dissections. The course of the spinal accessory nerve in the neck makes it particularly vulnerable to injury during the dissection near the sternocleidomastoid muscle and in the posterior cervical triangle."

CD008686,0,9291709,0,Clinical realities and economic considerations: economics of intrathecal therapy.,"The estimated annual cost of medical management of chronic back pain is $25 billion. Such management is often ineffective and overly costly. Most physicians who have employed intrathecal pain therapy attest to its efficacy in the management of intractable chronic pain. However, few economic analyses are available to evaluate the cost effectiveness of different modalities and to aid in clinical decision making and third-party reimbursement policies. Current analyses tend to focus on short-term cost-benefit measurements and to ignore variables such as quality of life and patient functioning. This bias has impaired the ability of payers to make appropriate decisions regarding the safety, cost effectiveness, and efficacy of intrathecal pain therapy in noncancer patients. Clinical data demonstrate that for cancer patients whose expectancies exceed 3 months, the overall costs of intrathecal pain therapy may be less than those of tunneled epidural catheters or external infusion devices. In nonmalignant pain, intrathecal therapy appears to be cost effective compared to conventional medical management at 22 months. Further debate and fine tuning of these economic models from all perspectives are required."
CD008686,0,9291707,0,Clinical realities and economic considerations: efficacy of intrathecal pain therapy.,"Studies of analgesia in cancer patients have revealed that intrathecal administration of opioids can deliver potent analgesia with fewer systemic side effects than equivalent doses of systemic opioids. In addition, several trials have examined the safety and efficacy of this modality in patients with pain of nonmalignant origin. In one survey of 35 physicians involving 429 patients treated with intrathecal therapy, physician reports of global pain relief scores were excellent in 52.4% of patients, good in 42.9%, and poor in 4.8%. In another study of 120 patients, the mean pain intensity score had fallen from 93.6 to 30.5 six months after initiation of therapy. In both studies, patients reported significant improvement in activities of daily living, quality of life measures, and satisfaction with the therapy. Constipation, urinary retention, nausea, vomiting, and pruritus are typical early adverse effects of intrathecal morphine and are readily managed symptomatically. Other potential adverse effects include amenorrhea, loss of libido, edema, respiratory depression, and technical issues with the intrathecal system."
CD008686,0,9447296,0,Clinical and biochemical presentation of primary hyperparathyroidism in Kansai district of Japan.,"Although the number of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) has increased since biochemical screening came to be widely employed, few data are available concerning the clinical analysis of Japanese patients. We therefore tried to determine the recent clinical and biochemical state of Japanese patients with pHPT. Clinical and biochemical data were analyzed in a series of 103 pHPT patients who had been hospitalized in Kobe University Hospital during a 17 year period from 1979 to 1995. The data were obtained from the hospital records and additionally from information through questionnaires performed in 1995. Patients were 29 males and 74 females. The average ages at diagnosis were 53.4 +/- 16.0 (SD) year-old and 53.9 +/- 15.2 year-old, respectively. The major clinical symptoms were nephrolithiasis (35.9%), thirst/polyuria (33.0%), easy fatigability (20.4%) and back pain/lumbago (16.5%), but 19.4% of the patients were asymptomatic. Out of 87 cases who received parathyroidectomy, 10 (11.5%) were diagnosed with parathyroid carcinoma. Age- and sex-corrected bone mineral density (BMD) of the radius was significantly lower in the group with back pain/lumbago than in the group without the symptom. Similarly, radial BMD was lower in the group with a high serum alkaline phosphatase value. Patients with nephrolithiasis had a lower urinary calcium/creatinine ratio (UCa/ UCr; 0.305 +/- 0.188 mg/mg) than the patients without nephrolithiasis (0.400 +/- 0.160 mg/mg). This inconsistent result suggests that some important factors except urinary calcium would contribute to urinary stone formation in pHPT. Our data mostly agreed with previous reports on a Caucasian population except for a relatively high prevalence of parathyroid carcinoma, but the negative correlation between nephrolithiasis and urinary calcium was not easily explicable. This finding should be confirmed by analyzing a larger number of cases."

CD008686,0,9282374,0,[A 76-year-old man with loss of vision and dementia].,"We report a 76-year-old man who developed blurred vision and dementia. He was apparently well until April 4, 1990 (70-year-old at that time) when he had a sudden onset of bilateral loss of vision. Corrected vision was 0.1 (right) and 0.09 (left). He was admitted to the ophthalmology service of our hospital on April 9, 1990, and neurological consultation was asked on April 11. Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented man without dementia. Higher cerebral functions were intact. He had bilateral large visual field defects with loss of vision; he was only able to count the digit number with his right eye and to recognize hand movement with his left eye. Otherwise neurologic examination was unremarkable. General physical examination was also unremarkable; he had no hypertension. Cranial CT scan was normal on April 11; lumber spinal fluid contained 1 cell/microliter, 63 mg/dl of sugar, and 97 mg/dl of protein; myelin basic protein was detected, however, oligoclonal bands were absent. He was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and oral steroid, however, no improvement was noted in his vision. He started to show gaze paresis to left, ideomotor apraxia, agnosia of the body, and dementia. Cranial CT scan on June 11 revealed a low density area in the deep left parietal white matter facing the trigonal area of the lateral ventricle. He was discharged on July 2, 1990. Hasegawa dementia scale was 2/32.5 upon discharge. In the subsequent course, he showed improvement in his mental capacity and Hasegawa dementia scale was 22.5/32.5 in 1991, however, no improvement was noted in his vision. In 1994, he started to show mental decline in that he became disoriented, and showed delusional ideation of self persecution and depersonalization with occasional confusional state. He also showed unsteady gait. Cranial MRI on February 13, 1996 revealed a T2-high signal intensity lesion on each side of the parietal deep white matter more on the left and another T2-high signal intensity lesion in the left pons as well as in the right thalamus. He complained of right hypochondrial pain and was admitted to another hospital on April 22, 1996. He was markedly confused and demented. He continued to show bilateral loss of vision, but no motor palsy was noted. Cranial CT scan on April 23, 1996 revealed diffuse cortical atrophy and ventricular dilatation in addition to the low density areas in both parietal deep white matter. He developed jaundice in the middle of May. Abdominal CT scan revealed multiple low-to iso-density areas in the liver and marked iso-to high-density swelling of the right kidney. The patient expired on June 9th, 1996. The patient was discussed in a neurological CPC and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had had a carcinomatous limbic encephalitis with optic neuropathy and a choleduct carcinoma. Other opinions entertained included acute disseminated encephalomyelitis with optic neuritis, and granulomatous angiitis of the central nervous system. Some participants thought the primary site of the carcinoma was the right kidney with metastasis to the liver. Post mortem examination revealed a mixed type carcinoma in the right kidney with liver metastases. Neuropathologic examination revealed an incomplete softening in the optic chiasm and the left optic nerve, and in the left parieto-occipital areas. (The right hemisphere was frozen for future biochemical assay.) One of the adjacent cortical arteries had an organized thrombus. Other arteries and arterioles also showed sclerotic changes. Some of the leptomeningeal arteries were positive for Congored staining as well as for beta-amyloid immunostaining. Many senile plaques were seen diffusely in the cerebral cortex and neurofibrillary tangles were seen in the CA1 area and the parahippocampal gylus. No cellular infiltrations or demyelinated foci were seen. The neuropathologic features were consistent with circulatory disturbance based on the amyloid angiopa"
CD008686,0,9278914,0,Intraoperative monitoring of spinal cord function using motor evoked potentials via transcutaneous epidural electrode during anterior cervical spinal surgery.,"Because false-positive results are not infrequent when monitoring somatosensory evoked potentials during surgery, monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) has been proposed and successfully used during the removal of spinal cord tumors. However, this often requires direct visual placement of an epidural electrode after a laminectomy. We evaluated the use of MEPs, recorded via a transcutaneously placed epidural electrode, to monitor motor pathway functional integrity during surgery on the anterior cervical spine. Sixteen patients underwent anterior cervical vertebral decompression and fusion for cervical myelopathy and/or radiculopathy. Before surgery, an epidural monitoring electrode was placed transcutaneously at the midthoracic level and was used to record MEPs after transcranial cortical electrical stimulation. Electrode placement was successful in all patients but one, and satisfactory baseline spinal MEPs were obtained except for one patient who had cerebral palsy with significant motor dysfunction. Patients showed no significant changes in spinal MEPs during surgery, and all had baseline or better motor function postoperatively. None had complications from epidural electrode placement or electrical stimulation. We conclude that motor pathways can be monitored safely during anterior cervical spinal surgery using spinal MEPs recorded via a transcutaneously placed epidural electrode, that MEP preservation during surgery correlates with good postoperative motor function, and that cerebral palsy patients may possess too few functional motor fibers to allow MEP recording."
CD008686,0,9262040,0,"Neuropathic pain in cancer patients: mechanisms, syndromes, and clinical controversies.","The identification of a neuropathic pain syndrome in a cancer patient requires a focused clinical evaluation based on knowledge of common neuropathic pain syndromes. If a tumor is directly involved in the etiology of the pain, oncologic treatment is an initial consideration and may include surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. There is no single accepted algorithm for the analgesic treatment of neuropathic pain and a systematic approach utilizing therapeutic trials of specific agents at gradually increasing doses is warranted. A trial of opioids, perhaps in combination with an NSAID, is warranted. If the pain is relatively unresponsive to an opioid, a trial with an adjuvant analgesic is reasonable. For example, a tricyclic antidepressant might be selected early for patients with continuous dysesthesia, and early treatment with an anticonvulsant might be used if the pain is predominantly lancinating or paroxysmal. Other adjuvant analgesics can be selected if there is insufficient response to these agents. A trial of sympathetic blockade, pharmacologic, anesthetic or surgical, should be considered in patients with evidence of causalgia or reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Physiatric modalities such as massage, heat, or cold; counterstimulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and orthopedic interventions, such as braces and splints may be useful. Epidural injections or neurostimulation of the spinal cord or brain can be considered in selected cases where appropriate expertise is available. Treatment of neuropathic pain remains a challenge for both clinicians and patients. The complexity of syndromes and underlying etiologic mechanisms warrants further clinical trials to determine the best treatment modalities for individual pain syndromes."

CD008686,0,10717213,0,Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for 25% of childhood cancer. Clinical and biological parameters define prognostic categories and therapeutic approaches. For the majority of children with B-progenitor ALL, age (1-9 yrs) and white blood count (WBC<50,000) indicate standard risk disease; WBC>50,000 and age>9 yrs. define eligibility for high-risk protocols. Infants (<1 yr. old) are high-risk, frequently associated with chromosomal t(4;11) translocation and extramedullary disease. T-cell immunophenotype is usually associated with clinical high-risk features, including older age, high WBC, and extramedullary disease. T-cell immunophenotype is usually associated with clinical high-risk features, including older age, high WBC, and extramedullary disease. Current regimens include induction chemotherapy, consolidation (often including high-dose systemic methotrexate, MTX), and continuation phases; intensification or reinduction is incorporated for high-risk disease. Preventive CNS therapy is a critical component of therapy. Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy (MTX +/- cytosine-arabinoside and hydrocortisone) and systemic agents provide adequate CNS therapy in standard risk patients. The ""threshold"" for using preventive cranial irradiation (Crl, 18 Gy) varies among protocols, but systematically includes those with T-cell ALL and WBS>50,000; other criteria may include B-progenitor ALL with WBC>100,000,philadelphia chromosome positive ALL, residual marrow disease at day 7, or male gender, For the 5% of children with CNS leukemia at diagnosis (defined as CSF with 5 or greater WBC/uL and positive cytology), Crl is administered at does of 18 to 24 Gy. Recent series show a CNS relapse rate approximating 5% Reinduction chemotherapy, IT therapy, and subsequent craniospinal irradiation ( typically 24, Gy Crl, 15 Gy spine) achieve durable secondary disease control in greater than 60% of cases with isolated CNS relapse. High-dose systemic MTX has virtually eliminated testicular relapse. CNS toxicities (including leukoencephalopathy) relate to systemic and IT MTX as well as Crl. Late neuropsychologicral data following Crl at 18 Gy show little intellectual deficit compared with children receiving MTX- based preventive therapy alone. Neuroendocrine dysfunction is apparent in long-term survivors following Crl at 24 Gy. The relative efficacy and toxicities of Crl versus more intensive MTX-based regimens are yet controversial. Overall disease-free survival in ALL approximates 70% in contemporary series."
CD008686,0,9486831,0,Intra-axial tumors of the cervicomedullary junction: surgical results and long-term outcome.,"Until recently, intra-axial brainstem tumors were traditionally regarded as surgically inaccessible lesions with a uniformly poor prognosis. However, increasing data indicate that distinct subgroups of brainstem tumors exist that are amenable to surgical intervention. To address this question, we reviewed our experience in the operative management of 39 consecutive patients, in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) era, with intra-axial cervicomedullary tumors, in order to determine those factors associated with long-term outcome. Thirty-nine patients (26 male, 13 female) underwent surgery by a single surgeon (F.J.E.) between 1985 and 1994. Mean age of diagnosis was 14 years (range 3 months - 60 years); mean duration of preoperative symptoms was 24 weeks (range 1-168). Twenty patients presented with lower cranial nerve dysfunction and 19 presented with motor and/or sensory dysfunction. All patients were graded according to the McCormick Scale, pre- and postoperatively, and at the time of follow-up. All patients were evaluated with MRI scanning. Twenty-three patients had either previous biopsy or subtotal resection, 13 previous radiation therapy, and 6 previous chemotherapy. The mean time to follow-up was 48 months (range 7-138). Twelve patients underwent gross total resection, 7 near total resection (>90%), 15 subtotal resection (50-90%), and 5 partial resection (< 50%). Histologically, there were 15 low-grade fibrillary astrocytomas, 9 ependymomas, 7 gangliogliomas, 3 anaplastic astrocytomas, 3 juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, and 2 mixed gliomas. Although the vast majority of tumors were low grade histologically, a higher proportion of the patients with high-grade lesions experienced tumor progression when compared to low-grade tumors (75 vs. 30%). Overall, the 5-year progression-free and total survivals were 60 and 89%, respectively. There was 1 death within the first postoperative month. Preoperative duration of symptoms greater than 15 weeks was associated with a longer progression-free survival. There was a trend for preoperative neurologic grade to predict functional neurologic outcome at follow-up. In summary, intra-axial tumors of the cervicomedullary junction are a distinct subset of brainstem tumors, predominantly of low-grade histology, with favorable long-term progression-free and total survivals following surgical resection. A long duration of preoperative symptoms may indicate an indolent clinical course and a more favorable prognosis. Our data also indicate that early surgical intervention is warranted prior to neurologic deterioration."
CD008686,0,9388381,0,[Pleural-origin malignant lymphoma in an elderly patient with chronic empyema and infection with the Epstein-Barr virus].,"A 73-year-old woman with a long-standing history of right-sided chronic empyema complained of lumbago. An artificial pneumothorax had been induced to treat pulmonary tuberculosis about 40 years previously. The year after she began to complain of lumbago, a tumor mass over the right anterior chest wall had grown rapidly. Pathologic examination revealed that it was a malignant lymphoma (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large cell, B cell type). Chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisolone, and then radiation therapy were given. The patient responded very well. The tumor mass on the surface of the chest wall disappeared completely. She was alive and well and there was no evidence of recurrence at the seven-month follow-up examination. Analysis with the polymerase chain reaction showed that the tumor contained DNA of the Epstein-Barr virus. The chronic empyema and local infection with the Epstein-Barr virus might have been a factor in the development of the malignant lymphoma."
CD008686,0,9338932,0,Cauda equina syndrome with pagetic vertebral fusion. Clinical recovery under calcium-vitamin D supplementation plus clodronate after apparent failure of pamidronate and acquired resistance to etidronate.,"A patient with an osteolytic L2-L3 pagetic block and pagetic lesions of L1 and the sacrum seen only as increased radionuclide activity became resistant to etidronate after the fifth course (5 mg/kg/d six months per year) and developed severe cauda equina syndrome (reduction in walking distance to 30 m and sphincter dysfunction) due primarily to vertebral hypertrophy. Five months after a ten-day course of intravenous pamidronate (22.5 mg/d), the clinical symptoms were unchanged, although the alkaline phosphatase level was down 50%. Oral clodronate (1,600 mg/day for six months per year) in combination with calcium and vitamin D supplementation dramatically improved the walking distance and sphincter disorders. Resolution of the neurological manifestations was complete after the second clodronate course. At last follow-up nine months after the fourth clodronate course, there was no evidence of a relapse and the alkaline phosphatase level was normal. The time course of events in this patient does not allow to affirm that pamidronate was ineffective and suggests that calcium and vitamin D supplementation improved mineralization of the pagetic block and enhanced the effect of bisphosphonate therapy."

CD008686,0,9225673,0,Stress and insufficiency fractures.,"Stress fractures of the axial and appendicular skeleton typically present as localized pain that develops without a history of specific acute injury. The differential diagnosis includes primary or metastatic neoplasms, infections, musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries, nerve compression syndromes and joint diseases. Plain radiographs may demonstrate changes consistent with fracture, including a fracture line or fracture callus. In many cases, however, initial radiographs are normal or nondiagnostic. This occurs most frequently in three situations: (1) when radiographs are obtained soon after the onset of symptoms, before the appearance of a fracture line or new bone formation; (2) in patients with osteopenia, in whom detection of a fracture line and new bone formation is difficult, and (3) when the fracture involves areas of the skeleton that are difficult to study with plain films (including the spine and pelvis). When the plain films are normal, other tests such as bone scans, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging usually demonstrate the fracture."
CD008686,0,9224245,0,Value of cervical spine radiographs as a screening tool.,"A review of the reports of 848 cervical spine radiographs was done to assess the yield of useful and critical information in a group of patients without trauma. In 470 of these patients the clinical record also was reviewed; 54.2% of the radiographs were read as having degenerative change, 35% were read as normal, and 8.5% were read as being consistent with muscle spasm. The remaining 2.3% included diagnoses of anatomic or congenital variants, soft tissue calcification, or old compression fractures. There were no serious diagnoses such as acute fracture, dislocation, or neoplasm that, had they not been identified, would have put the patient in jeopardy. Thus, for most outpatients with nontraumatic symptoms of a nonspecific or nonlocalizing nature, the use of cervical spine radiographs as a screening tool is not justified."

Magnetic resonance imaging is the best means of diagnosis. The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the cysts, though spontaneous remissions do occur. CT-guided aspiration of the cysts and corticosteroid injection can lead the symptoms to disappear, but only for a short time. In a retrospective study covering a period of 16.5 years, we discovered 24 juxta-facet cysts (10 ganglionic and 14 synovial cysts) with clinical symptoms in a total of 19,107 lumbar and thoracic operations performed to relieve nerve root compression: 16 cysts were located at the level L4-5,3 at the level L5-S1,2 at L3-4, and 1 each at the levels L2-3, L1-2, and T10-1. Seven patients complained of radicular pain, and the other 17 patients also had neurological deficits. Fourteen cysts were resected, and in 10 cases the lumbar disc was removed simultaneously.

In both situations, clinical and the radiologic findings are similar. We describe an epidermoid cyst in a 52-year-old female affected with a lumbar pain and recent urinary disorders. Symptoms were slow to appear and dependent on the location of the cyst. Epidermoid cyst contained keratin, cholesterol crystals and desquamed epithelial cells. On CT, epidermoid cyst was a hypodense lesion on MR. On T1 weighted images the tumor was hypointense. The signal appeared heterogeneous. There was no enhancement after Gadolinium DTPA injection. Differential diagnosis included: ependymoma, hemangioblastoma, neurinoma, meningioma and metastasis, but all these lesions are enhanced by contrast injection."

A case of leptomeningeal metastasis from an unknown primary source presenting with urinary incontinence as the sole complaint is reported.

CD008686,0,9272285,0,Congenital lumbosacral lipomas.,"Congenital lumbosacral lipomas can be responsible for progressive defects. The general feeling is that tethering of roots, filum, or cord probably explains this evolution, and that untethering of these structures could prevent late deterioration. Like the vast majority of neurosurgeons, we too have routinely and systematically operated on lumbosacral lipomas, even in the absence of neurological deficits. This policy stemmed from our belief that spontaneous neurological deterioration was frequent, recovery from preoperative deficits rare, and surgery both efficient and benign in nature. After 22 years of experience, we felt that it was necessary to review our series of 291 lipomas (38 lipomas of the filum and 253 of the conus) operated on from 1972 to 1994. To reassess the value of prophylactic surgery, we attempted an accurate evaluation of (1) the risk of pathology, (2) the risks involved in surgery, (3) the postoperative outcome with respect to preoperative deficits, and (4) the postoperative outcome in asymptomatic patients at 1 year and at maximum follow-up. Special attention was paid to 93 patients whose postoperative follow-up was more than 5 years (average 8.7, median 8, range 5-23 years). Of these 93 patients, 39 were asymptomatic preoperatively (7 with lipoma of the filum and 32 with lipoma of the conus). Lipomas of the filum and of the conus are entirely different lesions and were studied separately. In 6 cases prenatal diagnosis had been possible. The mean age at surgery was 6.4 years. Low back skin stigmata were present in 89.4% of cases. Preoperative neurological deficits existed in 57% of the patients and were congenital in 22%. Clinical signs and symptoms recorded were pain in 13.3% of the patients and/or neurological deficits affecting sphincter (52%), motor (27.6%) and sensory (22.4%) functions. Deficits were progressive in 22.4% of cases, slowly progressive in 58.8% of these and rapidly progressive in the remaining 41.2%. In 36 patients (13.2%) the lipomas were seen to grow either subcutaneously or intraspinally. Among these patients, 21 were infants, 2 were obese adolescents, and 10 were pregnant women. The metabolism of the fat within the lipomas was studied in 11 patients and found to be similar to that at other sites. Lipomas were associated with various other malformations, either intra- or extraspinal. These associated anomalies were rare in the case of lipomatous filum (5.2%) but frequent with lipomas of the conus, except for intracranial malformations (3.6%). Therapeutic objectives were spinal cord untethering and decompression, sparing of functional neural tissue and prevention of retethering. Procedures used to achieve these goals were subtotal removal of the lipoma, intraoperative monitoring, duroplasty, and sometimes closure of the placode. Histologically, lipomas consisted of normal mature fat. However, 77% of them also included a wide variety of other tissues, originating from ectoderm, mesoderm, or entoderm. This indicates that lipomas are either simple or complex teratomas. The results of the study are as follows. (1) Surgery was easy and safe when performed for treatment of lipomas of the filum (no complications), but difficult and hazardous in the case of lipomas of the conus (20% local, 3.9% neurological complications). (2) All types of deficit could be improved by surgery, which was beneficial in all cases of lipoma of the filum and 50% of cases of lipoma of the conus. (3) In asymptomatic patients long-term surgical results depended on the anatomical type of the lipoma. They were excellent in lipomas of the filum. In lipomas of the conus they were good in the short term but eroded with time. At more than 5 years of follow-up only 53.1% of the patients were still free of symptoms. (4) Reoperations were performed in 16 patients (5.5%), 5 (31.2%) of whom improved postoperatively, while in 7 (43.7%) progression stopped, in 3 (18.7%) deterioration continued and in 1 (6.2%) the condition was wor"

CD008686,0,9198101,0,[A 64-year-old woman with severe headache and progressive disturbance of consciousness].,"We report a 64-year-old woman who developed nausea, headache, and consciousness disturbance. She was well until four years before the onset of her neurologic illness when (April of 1990 at her 59 years of the age) she was found to have an early cancer in her anterior wall of the lower stomach. Subtotal gastrectomy was performed and the operative result was reported as curative. Four years after the surgery (December of 1994 at her 64 years of the age), she noted suboccipital headache and nausea which had become progressively worse and she was admitted to our service on May 24, 1995. On admission, she appeared chronically ill but general physical examination was unremarkable with normal vital signs. Neurologically she was alert and not demented, and the higher cerebral functions were intact. Cranial nerves were also unremarkable. She was able to walk in tandem and on heels. No motor weakness or ataxia was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were moderately increased, however, no Babinski sign was noted. Although she had headache, no meningeal signs were seen. Slight superficial and vibratory sensory loss was noted in both feet. Routine blood work was again unremarkable except for slight increase in CEA to 8.3 ng/dl (N < 5 ng/dl). The opening pressure of lumbar CSF was 180 mm H2O and the CSF contained 39 cells/microliter, 79 mg of protein, and 10 mg/dl of glucose. Approximately half of the cells were atypical malignant cells. Plain CT was unremarkable, however, tentorial border showed enhancement after contrast infusion. FGS showed no malignant tumors in the stomach. She was treated with intravenous glycerol and whole brain radiation, however, she continued to complain of severe headache, and her sensorium started to be disturbed one month after the admission. Follow-up cranial CT scan revealed enlargement of the lateral and the third ventricles. Her consciousness progressively deteriorated and she became comatose three months after the admission. Repeated cranial CT scan showed enlargement of the ventricles, but no mass lesions were seen within the brain. She developed respiratory arrest on September 25 of the same year. She was discussed in a neurological CPC and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had a gastric cancer with meningeal seeding developing meningeal carcinomatosis. The cause of deep coma was ascribed to damage of cerebral cortical areas secondary to metastatic carcinoma cells and fibrinous materials in the surface of the brain. Postmortem examination revealed thickening and clouding of leptomeninges of the cerebral convexity. On histologic observation, patchy areas of fibrous thickening were seen in the cerebral leptomeninges; in such areas, adenocarcinomatous cells were seen scattered. The basal meninges were free of carcinoma cells, however, leptomeninges of the cerebellum and brain stem tegmentum contained scattered carcinoma cells. The lateral and the third ventricles were enlarged, however, insides of the brain were free of pathologies; the ependymal layer were intact. In the stomach no carcinoma cells were remaining. Pneumonic changes were seen in the right upper and the left lower lobes which appeared to be the direct cause of her death. No evidence of tentorial herniation was noted. The cause of her deep coma was not clearly determined, however, combination of hydrocephalus and cortical malfunction due to leptomeningeal carcinoma cell infiltration and fibrinous material accumulation appeared to have played a role."

CD008686,0,9202888,0,Radiotherapy for palliation of symptoms in incurable cancer.,"Approximately one half of prescribed radiotherapy is given for palliation of symptoms due to incurable cancer. Distressing symptoms including pain, bleeding, and obstruction can often be relieved with minimal toxic effects. Painful osseous metastasis is common in oncologic practice. Ninety percent of patients with symptomatic bone metastases obtain some pain relief with a lowdose, brief course of palliative radiotherapy. One half of the responding patients may experience complete pain relief. A single dose of 800 cGy in the setting of painful bone metastasis may provide pain control comparable to more protracted treatment at a higher dose of radiation. Patients with lytic disease in weight-bearing bones, particularly in the presence of cortical destruction, should be considered for prophylactic surgical stabilization of their condition. Routinely a brief, fractionated course of radiotherapy is given postoperatively. Pain due to multiple bone metastases uncontrolled by analgesics can be managed with single doses of halfbody irradiation. Doses of 600 cGy delivered to the upper half-body (above the umbilicus) and 800 cGy to the lower half-body (from the umbilicus to the middle of the femur) will provide some pain relief in 73% of patients. Half-body techniques have been investigated as prophylactic treatment, as a complement to local-field irradiation, and as fractionated rather than singledose therapy. Although intravenous administration of strontium 89 has been associated with myelosuppression, this treatment has been shown (a) to relieve pain due to bone metastasis and (b) to delay development of new painful sites. Recent data from phase III trials demonstrated that bisphosphonates have a role in reducing skeletal morbidity due to bone metastasis. Bone pain was reduced, and the incidence of pathologic fracture and the need for future radiotherapy was decreased. Radiotherapy relieves clinical symptoms in 70% to 90% of patients with brain metastases. Brief treatment schedules (e.g., 2000 cGy in five fractions over 1 week) are as effective as more prolonged therapy. Patients with solitary brain metastasis and no extracranial disease or controlled extracranial disease should be considered for surgical resection, because phase III data indicate enhanced survival with such an approach. Whole-brain radiotherapy is routinely administered postoperatively. A phase III study is examining the impact of accelerated fractionated doses of radiotherapy (two treatments per day) on survival of patients with brain metastases. Stereotaxic radiosurgical treatment is becoming increasingly available and permits delivery of radiation to metastatic intracranial tumor with minimal exposure of normal surrounding brain This treatment is most commonly used at the time of a solitary recurrence of disease in patients who previously received whole-brain radiotherapy. A role for this modality in newly diagnosed brain metastases remains to be defined. Chest symptoms are common in patients with locally advanced lung cancer and are effectively palliated with one 1000 cGy or two 850 cGy one fraction doses of radiation to the thoracic inlet and mediastinum. Chest pain and hemoptysis are more effectively palliated than cough and dyspnea. In patients with stage III cancer there is no compelling evidence that radiotherapy confers a survival advantage, and it may be reasonable to administer thoracic radiotherapy only when the patient has significant symptoms and the goal is to achieve control of these symptoms. Approximately 75% of the cases of superior vena cava syndrome are due to lung cancer, and small-cell lung cancer is the most common histologic type. A histologic diagnosis should be obtained before treatment is started, because detection of lymphoma or small-cell carcinoma would necessitate systemic therapy. Eighty percent of the patients with vena cava syndrome due to malignant disease achieve symptom relief with a brief, fractionated, palliative course of rad"
CD008686,0,9161375,0,Tethered thoracic cord resulting from spinal cord herniation.,"Tethered cord syndrome (TCS) usually involves tethering of the lower cord at the conus medullaris from dural abnormalities, but may occur after spinal cord herniation. A tethered thoracic spinal cord is rare. We present an unusual case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of myelopathy presumed to be secondary to T6 cord compression resulting from T6-T8 arachnoid cyst. She continued to deteriorate after partial excision of the cyst. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging suggested recurrence of the presumed arachnoid cyst with cord compression and showed tethering at T6-T8. Surgical exploration revealed myelocele with cord herniation through the anterior thoracic dura. Pathologic diagnosis showed neural tissue with gliosis. After physical therapy treatments, the patient had increased lower extremity strength, ambulated with a cane, and regained some bladder control. Progressive myelopathy may represent tethering of the cord resulting from cord herniation. Early recognition of TCS, even in patients with minimal neurologic deficits, could prevent progressive disability."

CD008686,0,9410649,0,Bone metastases: Part I--Pathophysiology.,"Many cancers (especially breast, prostate, and lung cancers) metastasize to the bone. The most frequent site of bone involvement is the axial skeleton (i.e., cranium, ribs, spine, and pelvis). The sequelae of bone metastases include pain, hypercalcemia, pathologic fractures, and spinal cord compression. As patients survive for longer periods, effective management of bone metastases becomes critical to maintaining or improving quality of life. Controlling pain, preventing fractures and oncologic emergencies, and promoting mobility and function are the outcomes of successful management. Use of a clinical algorithm can assist the nurse in identifying bone metastases and managing the clinical sequelae. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and the ability to assess bone metastases will contribute to the nurse's ability to manage the clinical problems and to improve the quality of life of patients with cancer."
CD008686,0,9246585,0,Neural blockade in chronic and cancer pain.,Neural blockade can provide significant pain relief to patients with chronic and cancer pain but must be used in the correct manner and only on selected patients. The hazards of performing neurolytic treatments have become apparent with time and demonstrate the need to examine the long-term outcomes of these procedures. The present challenge is to identify with controlled trials those patients with chronic pain who would benefit from neural blockade.
CD008686,0,9202855,0,Disc protrusion in the child. Particular features and comparison with neoplasms.,"Lumbar intervertebral disc herniation, although common in adults, is infrequent in the young, and especially in patients under 17 years old. In this work we review clinical data pertaining to two pediatric groups of patients whose main complaint was low back pain and/or sciatica, trying to identify factors that might contribute to their earlier referral and to the differential diagnosis of protruded disc and spinal neoplasm in this population. Group A comprises 17 youngsters diagnosed as having lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus and group B, 16 children with neoplasms of the lower thoracic and lumbosacral regions. Both groups were similar in sex distribution and symptoms of pain and numbness. However, there was a striking difference in age at presentation. No patient in group A was younger than 11 years, while most of those in group B were in their first decade of life (P = 0.018). The classic clinical onset in the children with herniated discs started with low back pain and sciatica, as in the children with neoplasms, although in subgroup B leg pain tended to be bilateral. The usual examination findings in both groups were spinal rigidity and sensory loss, but motor weakness and impaired reflexes were found to be more frequent in the group with spinal growths (P = 0.02). Children with lumbosacral neoplasms also tended to present with atypical symptoms (acute onset, intracranial hypertension, subarachnoid hemorrhage and abdominal pain), while this was the exception in the group with herniated discs. Plain radiographs of the pediatric spine showed that X-ray examination is still a good tool for diagnosing spinal growths compared with their scant utility in disc herniations (P = 0.001). During the survey we were impressed by the children's apparent good tolerance to pain, which is probably due to the lack of the emotional component of pain in adults and explains their delayed referral for neurosurgical consultation. However, all modalities of treatment seemed to be effective in children, chemonucleolysis and surgery being extraordinarily effective in this age group. Accordingly, we see no reason for long-term conservative therapy in children with lumbar and sciatic pain; on the contrary, we believe these patients should be offered earlier neurosurgical treatment."
CD008686,0,9178402,0,Multifocal malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the spine.,"A 40-year-old patient was seen because of a three-month history of low back pain unresponsive to standard therapy. Crush fractures of T12 and L2 were seen on plain radiographs. A magnetic resonance imaging study disclosed lesions of all the vertebral bodies from T12 to the sacrum sparing the disks and epidural space. Histologic features of a vertebral biopsy specimen was consistent with malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the bone. The multifocal distribution caused some reluctance to accept this diagnosis, which was, however, confirmed by detailed immunohistochemical studies and reevaluation of the histologic slides by independent observers who were unaware of the initial diagnosis. Chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cisplatin was started but the patient died 15 months after the diagnosis. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma mainly affects the metaphyses of the long tubular bones. The spine is a very uncommon site of localization of this tumor. The multifocal spinal lesions in our patient may have been produced by metastases from an unidentified primary or by direct spread via the perivertebral soft tissues of a primary located in a vertebral body. The management of malignant fibrous histiocytoma relies on a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Although complete excision of the tumor can be followed by prolonged survival, the prognosis is bleak in unresectable forms."

CD008686,0,9136234,0,The inappropriate use of the epidural route in cancer pain.,"There continues to be controversy concerning the optimal use of the epidural route in cancer pain. Although spinal opioids undoubtedly give long-lasting analgesia with low doses, indiscriminate use cannot be recommended. Inappropriate indications for the epidural route are reported in three patients who required home palliative care. In contrast to epidural treatment, which caused severe clinical problems, simpler measures, including oral and subcutaneous opioids, were able to give adequate analgesia and a better quality of life. Education of nursing staff and family is necessary when using opioid epidural analgesia at home. Wide dissemination of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines among doctors and health-care workers can avoid the use of unnecessary and complicated techniques and improve the treatment of terminally ill patients suffering from cancer pain."

CD008686,0,9125745,0,[A case of acute cervical epidural abscess].,"Epidural abscess is very uncommon in the cervical region, and it is difficult to diagnose because of the diversity of its clinical course. The resulting neurological deficits remain unacceptably severe because of delays in diagnosis and treatment. We present a rare case of acute cervical epidural abscess. A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of esophageal carcinoma. During an overnight stay outside the hospital, he experienced sudden lumbago while removing snow at his home. The next day he developed back pain and high fever. He was drowsy but complained of neck pain. Lumbar puncture was dry. Two hours after the procedure, he developed respiratory arrest and became comatose. Consciousness and motor function recovered in response to artificial ventilation, but tetraplegia developed three days later. Cervical enhanced-CT suggested an epidural abscess. Emergency decompression laminectomy and drainage of the abscess combined with systemic antibiotics was performed. Postoperatively, the patient was afebrile, and his respiration and motor function gradually recovered. The histopathological diagnosis was abscess, but its origin was undetermined."
CD008686,0,9120625,0,Progressive posttraumatic myelomalacic myelopathy: treatment with untethering and expansive duraplasty.,"Patients with progressive posttraumatic myelomalacic myelopathy (PPMM), or tethered cord syndrome, present with symptoms and signs similar to those observed in case of progressive posttraumatic cystic myelopathy, that is, sensorimotor function deterioration, local and/or radicular pain, increased spasticity, increased autonomic dysreflexia, and sphincter dysfunction. The authors investigated surgical outcomes of untethering combined with expansive duraplasty. Forty patients with PPMM who presented with functional deterioration underwent untethering of the spinal cord and nerve roots with an expansive duraplasty. Meticulous dissections of adhesions on the dorsal and lateral aspects of the spinal cord and nerve roots were performed. Intraoperative ultrasonography was used to detect the presence of a confluent cyst and to assess the success of untethering. After surgery, the patients were treated using a protocol that involved frequent turning for 48 hours and subsequently mobilization. Preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, with and without administration of a contrast agent, was obtained in all patients, except one patient who underwent immediate and delayed computerized tomography (CT) myelography. The mean follow-up period was 3 years (range 20-57 months) for the 36 patients available for follow-up review. Spinal cord tethering was observed in all patients preoperatively. Trauma was the most common cause of this pathology, accounting for 31 of the 40 cases. Preoperative MR imaging did not demonstrate tumor recurrence in the group of five patients who had undergone an initial operation for tumor excision. The interval between the causative event and the operation was less than 5 years in half of the patients (20 of 40), with the longest interval lasting up to 37 years. Motor function deterioration was the most frequent manifestation; it was present in 31 of 40 patients. Improvements in motor function, autonomic dysreflexia, pain, sphincter dysfunction, and sensory function were found during the most recent follow-up examination in 79%, 75%, 62%, 50%, and 43% of the patients, respectively. Two patients experienced retethering of the spinal cord and one underwent a second operation. Surgical untethering and expansive duraplasty, followed by postoperative position rotation to avoid retethering, provide symptomatic relief for patients with PPMM."

CD008686,0,9109131,0,Current status of patient-controlled analgesia in cancer patients.,"Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is a relatively new technique in which patients are able to self-administer small doses of opioid analgesics when needed. Many different devices are available for opioid infusion, including a syringe pump, disposable plastic cylinder, and battery-operated computer-driven pump. These devices allow patients to choose an intermittent (demand) bolus, continuous infusion, or both modes of administration. Parameters, such as route, drug concentration dose, frequency, and maximum daily or hourly dose, are programmed by the physician. The patient decides whether or not to take a dose. Devices can be used to deliver the drug into a running intravenous infusion, the epidural space, or subcutaneously. Controlled trials indicate that PCA is probably superior to regular opioid administration in postoperative pain. Reported advantages include greater patient satisfaction, decreased sedation and anxiety, and reduced nursing time and hospitalization. Preliminary experience suggests that PCA is also useful and safe for cancer pain, but further research is greatly needed."

The clinical course and MRI of meningeal sarcomas in two cases are discussed with special regard to possible misinterpretation. In one case MRI demonstrated a circumscribed mass in contact with the meninges, with central areas of haemorrhage. In the other, a case of primary leptomeningeal sarcomatosis, several MRI examinations over the course of almost a year were unhelpful, despite severe neurological complaints. Then MRI revealed meningeal contrast enhancement all over the brain and spinal canal, together with cerebral infarcts. MRI of meningeal sarcomas has not been discussed in the literature. MRI did not permit specific diagnosis, but enabled visualisation of the extent of the tumour and/or meningeal involvement. Early histological diagnosis is indispensable for adequate treatment."

CD008686,0,9070524,0,The prevalence of back pain in children who have idiopathic scoliosis.,"A retrospective study of 2442 patients who had idiopathic scoliosis was performed to determine the prevalence of back pain and its association with an underlying pathological condition. Five hundred and sixty (23 per cent) of the 2442 patients had back pain at the time of presentation, and an additional 210 (9 per cent) had back pain during the period of observation. There was a significant association between back pain and an age of more than fifteen years, skeletal maturity (a Risser sign of 2 or more), postmenarchal status, and a history of injury. There was no association with gender, family history of scoliosis, limb-length discrepancy, magnitude or type of curve, or spinal alignment. At the latest follow-up evaluation, 324 (58 per cent) of the 560 patients who had had back pain at presentation had no additional symptoms. Forty-eight (9 per cent) of the 560 patients who had back pain had an underlying pathological condition: twenty-nine patients had spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis, nine had Scheurmann kyphosis, five had a syrinx, two had a herniated disc, one had hydromyelia, one had a tethered cord, and one had an intraspinal tumor. A painful left thoracic curve or an abnormal neurological finding was most predictive of an underlying pathological condition, although only eight of the thirty-three patients who had such findings were found to have such a condition. When a patient with scoliosis has back pain, a careful history should be recorded, a thorough physical examination should be performed, and good-quality plain radiographs should be made. If this initial evaluation reveals normal findings, a diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis can be made, the scoliosis can be treated appropriately, and non-operative treatment can be initiated for the back pain. It is not necessary to perform extensive diagnostic studies to evaluate every patient who has scoliosis and back pain."
CD008686,0,9065534,0,Gamma Knife radiosurgery for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: idiopathic and tumor related.,"Sixty patients with trigeminal neuralgia who did not have a response to pharmacologic treatment (including 22 who had no response to conventional surgical treatment) underwent stereotactic radiosurgical treatment with the Leksell Gamma Knife. A radiosurgical maximum dose of 70 Gy was delivered to the trigeminal nerve root adjacent to the pons via a 4-mm collimator helmet in 51 patients who presented with trigeminal neuralgia unrelated to tumors. In these patients, the root was localized by stereotactic MRI. Follow-up assessment of pain relief was accomplished by a third party not involved in the patients' clinical care. Within a latency period of 1 day to 4 months following the treatment, 38 of 51 patients (74.5%) were completely free of pain and eventually all medications were tapered off. An additional seven patients (13.7%) experienced reductions in pain from 50 to 90% and utilized little or no medications. Patients who had no prior surgical intervention fared much better than those who had previous surgery to relieve their facial pains. At last follow-up, a mean of 16.3 months (range 6-36 months) after treatment, 41 patients (80.4%) remained pain-free or had marked pain reduction. There were four patients with recurrent pain. All 26 patients with classical symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia with no atypical features who had no prior surgery, had complete or nearly complete pain relief, and none of these patients had recurrent pain. Nine patients with trigeminal neuralgia due to tumors received standard radiosurgical treatment directed at their tumors, and eight of nine (88.8%) had pain relief. Of the total of 60 patients treated for trigeminal neuralgia, 49 (81.7%) experienced complete or nearly complete relief of pain at last follow-up. Only one patient with pre-existing facial sensory loss due to a tumor had a mild increase in facial numbness. No other patient experienced either loss of facial sensation or any other complication. Gamma Knife radiosurgery appears to be a minimally invasive, safe, and effective therapy of trigeminal neuralgia."

Clinically, it is characterized by insidious onset of local swelling and pain in several metaphyses. A symmetric, recurrent and multifocal pattern is usual. Spinal involvement is possible. Inconstant association with a cutaneous affection (palmoplantar pustulosis, acne fulminans, psoriasis), or less frequently with an inflammatory chronic gut disorder is described. Pathogenesis usually recognized is an enthesopathy. Enthesitis may progress to the osseous part of the enthese and produce an aseptic chronic osteomyelitis. Biopsy specimen with culture is certainly necessary to rule out bacterial osteomyelitis and bone tumor. It is particularly true when the bone lesion is isolated. Disease course is benign and self-limited. The clinical course is characterized by recurrences and remission occurring for 6 to 10 years. Treatment based on non steroid antiinflammatory drugs is usually effective."
CD008686,0,9090640,0,Relief of intractable cancer pain by human chromaffin cell transplants: experience at two medical centers.,"In addition to its possible role as a replacement source in CNS degenerative diseases, neural transplantation may be used to augment the normal production of neuroactive substances. Our laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago has shown, in both acute and chronic pain models, that transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue or isolated chromaffin cells into CNS pain modulatory regions can reduce pain sensitivity in rodents. Chromaffin cells were chosen as the donor source since they produce high levels of both opioid peptides and catecholamines, substances which reduce pain sensitivity when injected locally into the spinal subarachnoid space. The analgesia produced by these transplants probably results from the release of both opioid peptides and catecholamines since it can be blocked or attenuated by both opiate and adrenergic antagonists. Studies indicate that even over long periods there is no apparent development of tolerance. Promising results have been obtained in preliminary clinical studies using allografts of adrenal medulla to relieve cancer pain. This clinical review encompasses results at two Medical Centers-University of Illinois at Chicago and University Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France-in assessing efficacy of subarachnoid adrenal medullary transplantation for alleviating cancer pain. Our clinical and autopsy data strongly support our previous laboratory studies, i.e., that chromaffin cell transplants into the subarachnoid space represent a promising new approach to the alleviation of chronic pain. It is suggested that further clinical studies are now warranted."

CD008686,0,9217555,0,A clinician's approach to acute low back pain.,"Two important goals in treating acute low back pain are to return the patient to regular activity as quickly as possible and to do so in a manner that is cost-effective. By following a logical treatment protocol, the clinician is often able to provide the treatment necessary to provide the patient with relief. Referral to an orthopedist or neurosurgeon may be appropriate in only a minority of cases. Thus, after the initial history and physical examination, ruling out (or in) conditions that require urgent or emergent care is essential. These conditions include cauda equina syndrome, circulatory collapse due to expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm, and tumor, infection, and other underlying disorders as a cause of low back pain. Patients without these conditions can be started on conservative therapy-without radiographic or laboratory tests-regardless of the specific diagnosis. Conservative therapy consists of passage of time, controlled physical activity, physical modalities (e.g., cryotherapy or thermotherapy), local injections, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and muscle relaxants. Because low back pain is so common, even the small proportion of patients who do not improve after 6 weeks of conservative therapy represents a sizable number. The location and radiation of pain are used as initial guides to classifying these patients into four groups: those with localized pain, sciatica, anterior thigh pain, or posterior thigh pain. Each follows a different diagnostic path, which will be described herein."

CD008686,0,11387078,0,Percutaneous Vertebroplasty.,"Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) with acrylic cement [polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)]consists of injecting PMMA into vertebral bodies weakened by osseous lesions. The aim of PVP with PMMA is to obtain an antalgic effect by consolidation in destructive lesions of the spine. There are three major indications: vertebral angiomas, osteoporotic vertebral crush syndromes, and malignant vertebral tumors. Indications in vertebral angiomas only concern patients with aggressive clinical signs (severe pain or nervous compression) and/or aggressive radiological signs. Indications in osteoporotic vertebral crush syndromes only concern patients suffering from back pain related to one or two adjacent vertebral collapses resistant to medical treatment for several weeks. Indications in malignant vertebral tumors only concern patients suffering from severe back pain related to a destruction of the vertebral body, not involving the major part of the cortical bone. Complications of PVP occur essentially in patients with vertebral metastasis. In the great majority of cases, these complications heal under medical treatment. In patients with osteoporotic vertebral crush syndromes or vertebral angiomas, the complications are represented by the increase or onset of radiculalgias (in less than 1%), which disappear after local anesthetic injection."
CD008686,0,9709805,0,[Imaging of the temporomandibular joint].,"A large number of imaging techniques are available nowadays to visualise the temporomandibular joint and surrounding structures. It is important that osseous structures as well as soft tissue can be shown. Transcranial images, conventional tomography, panoramic radiography and computed tomography (CT) are more suitable for viewing the osseous structures. The best techniques to evaluate the soft tissues are arthrography and especially magnetic resonance imaging (MR). The panoramic radiography is the technique of choice in the general practice and provides adequate screening images of the temporomandibular joints, mandible, maxilla, teeth and surrounding tissues. When the joint is suspected of developmental anomalies, neoplastic conditions or a condylar trauma, CT-images are necessary to depict the bony abnormalities. CT has a poor reliability in imaging the disk. For this reason, disk displacements of the temporomandibular joint are best shown with MR, although the clinician should be very restrictive in using MR-images. They are very expensive and are only useful to confirm an uncertain diagnosis, or if disc surgery is the treatment of choice. The anamnesis and the clinical investigation are still the most important elements in diagnosing craniomandibular dysfunction."
CD008686,0,9686226,0,[Sacral nerve root cysts. Discussion on the mechanism of nerve root suffering. Apropos of 4 cases].,"Low back pain, sciatia or perineal chronic pain are sometimes related to perineural sacral cysts. Surgical treatment is difficult and may lead to pain or neurological worsening. We report four cases of symptomatic perineural cysts; three of them where operated on with two good results and one increasing perineal pain. Anatomical and radiological description are reviewed. From a therapeutical point of view, we can distinguish two clinical types of radicular suffering. Perineural cyst can cause a commun radicular extrinsic compression; in such a case surgical operation will improve radicular pain. The cystic nerve root can present an intrinsic suffering because of on intradural dilaceration. Then surgery must be avoided specially when many roots are involved because it may worsen the pluriradicular suffering."

CD008686,0,9490090,0,Radiotherapy of vertebral hemangiomas.,"Between 1975 and 1996, 14 patients (11 females, 3 males) with vertebral hemangioma received treatment with radiotherapy. Thirteen patients had a history of back pain or lumbago and 2 patients had neurological symptoms such as sensory impairment or paraplegia. The standard dose administered was 36 Gy in 18 fractions (five treatments per week). In the 13 patients with pain, this was completely or partially relieved. The condition of a man with hypesthesia of the legs deteriorated and a woman with paraplegia who was treated with decompressive laminectomy followed by radiotherapy recovered completely after irradiation. CT scan before irradiation showed thickened trabeculae as small punctate areas of sclerosis in all patients. At MR imaging before irradiation, T2-weighted MR images showed areas of high intensity in all patients and MR images demonstrated lesion enhancement. However, none of the patients who were treated successfully with radiation demonstrated any changes of the affected vertebra in the conventional radiographic films. CT scan or MR imaging, even 5 years after irradiation. Radiological imaging is indispensable for the diagnosis of vertebral hemangiomas but does not appear to be useful for evaluating the effects of radiotherapy."
CD008686,0,9483161,0,Systematic review of outpatient services for chronic pain control.,"AIM OF REPORT. This report reviews the evidence about the effectiveness of treatments for chronic pain. While treatment of chronic pain is usually seen as an integrated service, this report concentrates on the individual interventions that constitute the service. HOW THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED. Searches of databases and journals identified over 15,000 randomised studies with pain as an outcome, and many more which were not randomised. Over 150 systematic reviews relevant to chronic pain treatment were identified and their quality assessed using a simple scoring system. Systematic reviews conducted for this report were based mainly on randomised trials. The number needed to treat (NNT) was chosen as the output for the report. NNTs of 2-4 indicate effective treatments. Because NNT is treatment-specific it overcomes problems associated with highly variable placebo or control event rates in pain trials. Such variability is predominantly due to the limited numbers of patients in the clinical trials. Dichotomous outcome measures are important in synthesising information from many studies, and in deriving NNTs. Methods have been developed which allow mean information on pain relief and intensity to be converted reliably into the simple dichotomous outcome of at least 50% pain relief. RESEARCH FINDINGS. PHYSICAL INTERVENTIONS. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been shown not to be effective in postoperative and labour pain. In chronic pain, there is evidence that TENS effectiveness increases slowly, and that large doses need to be used. There is lack of evidence for the effectiveness of TENS in chronic pain. There is a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of relaxation. Intravenous systemic regional blockade with guanethidine has been shown to be without effect. Epidural corticosteroids are effective in the short term for back pain and sciatica. Injections of corticosteroids in or around shoulder joints for shoulder pain have been shown not to be effective. There is a lack of evidence supporting spinal cord stimulators. Case series are of poor quality and do not provide evidence of effectiveness, although at least 50% pain relief at 5 years is reported in over 50% of patients. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS. Minor analgesics are important in chronic pain. NNTs were calculated for analgesics given orally for moderate or severe acute postoperative pain. The NNTs found ranged from 17 (poor) for codeine, 60 mg, to 2.5 (good) for ibuprofen, 400 mg. Anticonvulsant and antidepressant drugs are prescribed for neuropathic pains like diabetic neuropathy. NNTs are of the order of 2.5, showing them to be effective treatments. However, there are too few studies with too few patients to determine which is the best drug. Minor adverse events are common, and major adverse events occur in about 1 in 20 patients. There are no studies comparing antidepressants and anticonvulsants directly. Systemic local anaesthetic-type drugs have been shown to be effective in nerve injury pain but there is little or no evidence to support their use in migraine or cancer-related pain. Topical NSAIDs (for example, gels, creams) are effective in rheumatological conditions with an overall NNT of 3. There are too few studies to determine which is the best agent. Topical NSAIDs have few adverse events; most importantly they are without the major gastrointestinal adverse events found with oral NSAIDs, which might make them an important choice for some patients with peripheral arthritis.

CD008686,0,9401656,0,Giant intrasacral schwannomas: report of six cases.,"Only 4 of the 30 previously reported cases of giant sacral schwannomas have been studied with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We are reporting 6 more cases, 5 of which had MRI studies. There were 5 women and 1 man (average age 45 years) with long lasting symptoms consisting of lumbosacral and radicular pain accompanied by urinary disturbances and dysaesthetic sensations in the lower limbs. CT clearly defined sacral bone involvement but poorly demonstrated intraspinal tumour extension which was more evident in MRI studies. MRI also clearly showed the intrapelvic extension of the tumour, its relationship with the neighbouring structures and the dumbbell growth pattern due to tumour extension through sacral foramina which are important data for making a pro-operative diagnosis and surgical planning. Surgical treatment consisted of piecemeal tumour resection through a posterior approach in four cases. Two patients underwent operation through an abdominal transperitoneal approach followed by a sacral laminectomy. Total intracapsular resection was apparently achieved in 5 cases. Through an average follow-up period of 9.2 years and despite a rather conservative approach, the recurrence rate has been very low in our series and only one patient had to be re-operated on for tumour recurrence."
CD008686,0,9401655,0,Peripheral nerve schwannomas--an analysis of 16 patients.,"16 patients with peripheral nerve neurinomas (benign schwannomas) were operated upon in our hospital between 1990-1995. The largest tumours were found on proximal segments of peripheral nerves (brachial plexus: 15 cm, sciatic nerve: 20 cm). The average duration of symptoms was 1 1/2 years (range: 3 months-15 years). Pain or painful paraesthesias were the main complaints (13/16). Postoperatively, 9 patients were painfree while 4 improved. Similarly, neurological deficits were favourably influenced by the operation: Out of 5 patients with motor deficits 4 had complete, 1 patient had partial recovery. One out of 4 patients with sensory deficits had complete recovery, 2 remained unchanged, while 1 worsened. Two patients developed new motor and 6 patients new sensory deficits, which (in the course of time) did not disappear completely. New deficits developed predominantly in patients with large tumours or longstanding symptoms. Tumour recurrences were not seen during the follow-up period of 23 months. Our findings revealed that in the majority of cases peripheral nerve neurinomas can be excised with good results. Patients should be treated by a neurosurgeon with special expertise in peripheral nerve surgery. The patient should be thoroughly informed pre-operatively about any eventual new neurological deficits following surgery."
CD008686,0,9361111,0,Myxopapillary ependymoma of the conus medullaris and filum terminale in the pediatric age group.,"Myxopapillary ependymoma of the conus medullaris and filum terminale is a relatively common spinal intradural neoplasm in adulthood. However, only a reported 8-12% of such tumors affect this site in children, and the ideal management remains controversial. Three children with myxopapillary ependymomas of the conus medullaris and filum terminale were treated by the author over a 2-year period with an at least 24-month follow-up. These children, ages 7, 8 and 13 years, included 1 male and 2 females. Their salient presentation was an acute exacerbation of chronic lower back pain. The duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis ranged from 16 to 18 months. A preoperative MRI, with and without contrast, was available for every case. All children underwent replacement laminoplasty with gross total tumor resection. Somatosensory evoked potentials were used in all surgeries. An early postoperative MRI of the entire neural axis was available for all cases. No permanent complications were noted. Self-catheterization for 6 weeks was required in 1 child with preoperative urinary incontinence. One child received radiation therapy following a recurrence. Clinical and surgical results were compared to the only 2 other reported series (11 patients) addressing this type of tumor in children. Based on this review, the authors propose that: (1) unexplained and intractable lumbar pain in childhood should be thoroughly investigated with an MRI scan: (2) the gross feature of myxopapillary ependymoma allowing for complete resectability appears to be the key prognostic factor; (3) radiotherapy appeared to have no proven value in completely resected tumors in children; (4) postoperative baseline MRI and regular sequential imaging studies are essential for long-term follow-up, and (5) replacement laminoplasties may be of value in preventing future spinal deformities, musculoskeletal pain and allowing for an 'easier' resection in the event of a recurrence."
CD008686,0,9255366,0,[Intramuscular myxoma. Apropos of two cases].,"The authors report two cases of rare localization of intra muscular myxoma: one in the buttock, and the other in the lumbar area. The first case, a 58 years old woman had a four month history of a mass in the buttock. Computed tomography revealed the presence of a solid tumor. Diagnosis was based on histological examination. After surgical treatment no recurrence was observed after fourteen months. The second case was a 54 years old woman who presented a sciatica with back pain and neurological signs. The symptoms didn't response to medical treatment. Computed tomography showed an enlarged and-cystic lumbar lesion extending to the first sacral hole, with bone erosion of L3 and L4 articular apophysis and spinous process. Needle biopsy and surgical excision of the tumor were performed. Total neurological recovery was observed and no recurrence was observed after three years. The authors reminded the characteristics of this rare and benign soft tissue tumor and specified the place of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to establish the diagnosis which was still confirmed by histological examination of an open biopsy. Clinical follow-up revealed exceptional recurrence and no metastasis."

They are one of the most frequent tumors of the posterior fossa in adults. In this retrospective study the data of 41 operated patients (23 men and 18 women) with a hemangioblastoma of the CNS are demonstrated. The mean age of the patients was 42.2 years (Range 4-70 years). 76% of the hemangioblastomas were located in the cerebellum, 9% in the cerebral hemispheres, 7% in the spinal canal and 5% in the brain stem. Signs of increased intracranial pressure and cerebellar dysfunction were the most frequent symptoms. Complete tumor removal was achieved in 90% of all operated cases. 82% of the hemangioblastomas were cystic and 18% solid. The mean diameter of the tumor cysts was 36 mm (Range 20-60 mm) and 18 mm (Range 2-40 mm) of the solid tumors. In 7% of the cases tumor recurrence was seen with a mean time interval of 5.7 years."
CD008686,0,9235725,0,[Treatment of pain in oncology].,"Basic guidelines for cancer pain treatment can be found in many different handbooks published in the last years. Particularly those of the World Health Organisation published in 1986 and revised in 1996, furnish useful indication for cancer pain treatment. The authors therefore focused on resuming the most recent development in this field. In the research regarding alternative routes of administration of opioids in alternative to the oral route, the rectal administration of morphine and methadone and the transdermal route for fentanyl have proved to be efficacious. The subcutaneous route (for morphine) as well as the intravenous, peridural and subaracnoid routes, being known for some time are not taken in consideration in this paper. Various studies suggest that alternative routes are necessary in 53-70% of patients in their last days or months of live. The most frequent causes for the need to stop oral administration are dysphagia, nausea, and uncontrollable vomiting, bowel obstruction, malabsorption, cognitive failure, coma, and pain syndromes requiring anaesthetics which need be administered via the spinal route. Among the drugs, tramadol seems to be effective in the control of moderate pain. Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic drug; it has an agonist effect on mu 1 receptors of opioids and acts also by inhibiting the re-uptake of noradrenaline and serotonine which activates descending monoaminergic inhibitory pathways. Recent clinical studies revealed that pamidronate has an analgesic effect in pain due to bone metastasis. Pamidronate is part of the biphosphonates, which are active on bone metabolism and are usually being used for the treatment of hypercalcaemia in cancer. The authors also describe briefly the indication of ketamin in association with morphine for the treatment of neuropathic pain."
CD008686,0,9205626,0,[Primary spinal osteosarcoma. Apropos of a case].,"We report a case of primary osteogenic sarcoma of the third lumbar vertebra, detailing the neuroradiologic and therapeutic aspects. The clinical presentation was limited to low back pain which radiated to the left thigh for 5 months. Lumbosacral spine roentgenograms revealed a sclerotic lesion of the left part of the body of the third lumbar vertebra. Treatment consisted of total vertebrectomy, chemotherapy completed with radiotherapy. Fourteen months after a complex combined treatment no recurrence was observed. A review of the literature highlighted the rarity of this tumor. Usually, patients with vertebral osteogenic sarcoma do poorly. Today, the therapeutic approach for these spinal tumors should use techniques developed in the treatment of osteosarcoma of the extremities because of their encouraging results."
CD008686,0,9190320,0,[Review of current pharmacologic treatment of pain].,"Pain is the main reason prompting patients to consult their physicians. In acute conditions, pain has a very particular significance as a warning sign, enabling the physician to attempt a diagnosis. Nevertheless, its detrimental effect upon the individual (even in the case of acute pain) and its cost to society are now widely acknowledged. There can be no doubt about the physical component of pain, but the psychological and social aspects should not be ignored, particularly in the case of chronic pain. There is no single therapeutic approach to pain and, more often than not, successful treatment comprises a combination of several. Pharmacological treatments are undeniably the most common approach. In clinical practice, recent advances have been based upon an improved understanding of 'old' substances such as morphine and, at the same time, research continues in the hope of finding the 'ideal' analgesic-effective in most situations but without adverse effects: this appears to be a somewhat utopian arm at present, considering the number of different causes of pain. An improved understanding of the physiological mechanisms of pain has led, within the field of clinical practice, to several methods of differentiating pain. These depend on whether or not pain responds to morphine, or on the type of pain: pain due to an excess of nociception, pain resulting from deafferentation (caused by damage to nerve pathways) in the central or peripheral nervous system and psychogenic (idiopathic) pain. Likewise, there are several different ways of classifying analgesic treatments: according to the intensity of pain, as with use of the WHO ladder (which is based on the notion of steps) for the treatment of cancer pain; according to the presumed physiopathological mechanism and, in particular, the response to morphine, and according to the presumed central or peripheral mechanism of the drugs. In reality, peripherally acting drugs can also have a central mechanism of action, just as drugs known to have a central mechanism of action can also have peripheral activity. As a result, several therapeutic classes have been identified. Firstly NSAIDs, which act by inhibiting the enzymes that synthesise prostaglandins, cyclooxygenases (COX-1, COX-2), but which also act upon lipo-oxygenases: Their efficacy is interesting, although somewhat limited by both their ceiling effect and the frequent adverse gastrointestinal reactions they produce. Specific inhibitors of COX-2 could well reduce the risk of adverse effects. Opioids constitute the first-line treatment for pain, particularly severe pain. There are several classifications for these drugs. Firstly, weak opioids (such as codeine) and strong opioids (such as morphine) are differentiated. Secondly, a distinction is made between pure agonists (such as morphine), partial agonists (such as buprenorphine), agonist-antagonists (such as nalbuphine) and antagonists (such as naloxone). Finally, agents are distinguished on the basis of their chemical structure (synthetic, semi-synthetic or natural derivatives). These molecules act upon different receptors (mu, delta, kappa, sigma) and, although peripheral mechanisms have been described, their activity occurs mainly at spinal and supraspinal levels. They provide a potent analgesic effect but are also responsible for various adverse effects-nausea, vomiting, sedation, constipation and respiratory depression-which seriously limit their use. As long as the indication is appropriate, these drugs should not be withheld because of fear of dependence or abuse. It has been observed that other adjuvant therapeutic approaches, generally used to treat conditions other than pain, provide pain relief in certain situations. These include corticosteroids, which are-widely used in rheumatology and oncology, and antidepressants, which are frequently used to treat chronic pain, especially that with a neuropathic component. Anti-epileptics are also used, particularly for excrutiating"
CD008686,0,9183449,0,[Carcinomatous meningitis: rare complication of bladder cancer].,"The sites of metastases of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder are nodes, liver, lung and bone, but the meningeal infiltration is rare. Therefore, one case of meningeal carcinomatosis is reported. After cystectomy for an undifferentiated carcinoma of the bladder, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. Three months after treatment completion, symptoms of cerebellar ataxia occurred and gradually confusion appeared. The initial cerebra spinal fluid showed clumps of malignant cells. The patient died 15 days after the neurological symptoms occurred. The clinical diagnosis of meningeal carcinomatosis is based on neurological manifestations at more than one level of the neuraxis. Symptoms may present simply as headache or confusion. Meningeal carcinomatosis from urothelial cancer seems to show some specific features: poorly differentiated tumour and high frequency of cerebellar symptoms. Intrathecal treatment essentially has a pain-effect. Mean survival time is as short as 20 weeks. The increasing incidence of this neurological complication in urothelial cancer does not only result from an increase in patient longevity but also from possible side-effects of chemotherapy, so as localized changes in blood-brain barrier permeability induced by antineoplastic drugs. Therefore, we may wonder whether meningeal carcinomatosis might not be regarded as an iatrogenic effect."

CD008686,0,9131907,0,[Diagnosis and treatment of the patient with trigeminal neuralgia].,"Neuralgia of the trigeminus (NT) is the most common of cranial nerve neuralgias. Its diagnosis is entirely clinical and its most common form of presentation is well understood. Questions of differential diagnosis can emerge with certain entities such as atypical trigeminal neuralgia, short-duration unilateral neuralgiform cephalea of the trigeminus (SUNCT) arising from injection to the conjunctival, lacrimal or other glands, cluster headache, chronic paroxymal hemicrania, pain arising in the teeth and myofacial pain syndrome. The three main causative factors of NT are compression of the nerve root by an artery in the prepontine space, thereby creating an area of demyelinization, compression of the nerve by a tumor, and multiple sclerosis. The first is the most common of the three. NT can be classified as essential in 10 to 30% of patients. Recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR), and its advantages over other imaging systems, have made MR the diagnostic method of choice. The first treatment is medical and the basic drugs involved can be considered classic. Other therapies have been suggested in recent years, however, and should probably be studied further. Two substances stand out among those proposed: tocainide, an antiarrhythmic drug, and pimozide, an antipsychotic. Surgical treatment of NT can address either the cause (tumor or vascular compression) or symptoms, the latter being indicated when medical treatment fails. Surgery can be performed on peripheral nerves, on the gasserian ganglion and on the posterior fossa. The indications, outcomes and possible complications are quite different for each approach, making choice controversial."
CD008686,0,9102601,0,[Sacrococcygeal chordoma simulating pilonidal cyst].,"Chordoma is a rare neoplasm arising in the cerebrospinal axis from nothochordal remnants. The commonest location is in the sacrococcygeal area, then in the sphenooccipital region and less frequently in other parts of the vertebral column. Chordoma has been found in all age groups, but the greatest incidence was found between the fifth and the seventh decades: there is a male predominance. Signs and symptoms of chordoma are related to tumor location and are often present for a long period of time because of the slow growth of the neoplasia. Sacrococcygeal chordomas may produce lower back pain, bladder or anorectal dysfunction or mass. Three histologic subtypes are currently considered: conventional, chondroid and dedifferentiated chordoma. Comparing with conventional chordoma, chondroid chordoma shows a better prognosis while dedifferentiated chordoma has a worse prognosis. However the malignant potential of chordoma is most likely due to incomplete surgical excision because of the multifocality of the neoplastic growth. For that reason, local recurrence is common and accounts in large part for the mortality for this tumor. The best treatment consists of a wide surgical excision coupled with adjuvant radiation therapy. We report a case of sacrococcygeal chordoma arised in a 48 year-old-man; the clinical features of the tumor showed a close resemblance with a pilonidal cyst. When the diagnosis of conventional chordoma was done the patient were treated by surgery and by intraoperative radiotherapy followed by external radiotherapy. This peculiar therapy was adopted in the attempt to reduce the risk of local recurrence. Six months after this treatment the patient was well and no signs of local recurrence was found by the magnetic resonance imaging."
CD008686,0,9093822,0,Pedicle screw fixation in spinal disorders: a European view.,"Continuing controversy over the use of pedicular fixation in the United States is promoted by the lack of governmental approval for the marketing of these devices due to safety and efficacy concerns. These implants have meanwhile become an invaluable part of spinal instrumentation in Europe. With regard to the North American view, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews that consider the historical evolution of pedicle screw systems, the rationales for their application, and the clinical outcome from a European perspective. This literature review suggests that pedicular fixation is a relatively safe procedure and is not associated with a significantly higher complication risk than non-pedicular instrumentation. Pedicle screw fixation provides short, rigid segmental stabilization that allows preservation of motion segments and stabilization of the spine in the absence of intact posterior elements, which is not possible with non-pedicular instrumentation. Fusion rates and clinical outcome in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures appear to be superior to that achieved using other forms of treatment. For the correction of spinal deformity (i.e., scoliosis, kyphosis, spondylolisthesis, tumor), pedicular fixation provides the theoretical benefit of rigid segmental fixation and of facilitated deformity correction by a posterior approach, but the clinical relevance so far remains unknown. In low-back pain disorders, a literature analysis of 5,600 cases of lumbar fusion with different techniques reveals a trend that pedicle screw fixation enhances the fusion rate but not clinical outcome. The most striking finding in the literature is the large range in the radiological and clinical results. For every single fusion technique poor and excellent results have been described. This review argues that European spine surgeons should begin to back up the evident benefits of pedicle screw systems for specific spinal disorders by controlled prospective clinical trials. This may prevent forthcoming medical licensing authorities from restricting the use of pedicle screw devices and dictating the practice of spinal surgery in Europe in the near future."
CD008686,0,9060007,0,Malignant bone pain: pathophysiology and treatment.,"The presence of bone metastases predicts the presence of pain and is the most common cause of cancer-related pain. Although bone metastases do not involve vital organs, they may determine deleterious effects in patients with prolonged survival. Bone fractures, hypercalcaemia, neurologic deficits and reduced activity associated with bone metastases result in an overall compromise in the patient's quality of life. A metastasis is a consequence of a cascade of events including a progressive growth at the primary site, vascularization phase, invasion, detachment, embolization, survival in the circulation, arrest at the site of a metastasis, extravasion, evasion of host defense and progressive growth. Once cancer cells establish in the bone, the normal process of bone turnover is disturbed. The different mechanisms responsible for osteoclast activation correspond to typical radiologic features showing lytic, sclerotic or mixed metastases, according to the primary tumor. The release of chemical mediators, the increased pressure within the bone, microfractures, the stretching of periosteum, reactive muscle spasm, nerve root infiltration and compression of nerves by the collapse of vertebrae are the possible mechanisms of malignant bone pain. Pain is often disproportionate to the size or degree of bone involvement. A comprehensive assessment including a trusting relationship with the patient, taking a careful history of the pain complaint, the characteristics of the pain, the evaluation of the psychological status of the patient, neurological examination, the reviewing of diagnostic studies and laboratory findings, and individualization of the therapeutic approach, should precede any treatment. Radiotherapy is the cornerstone of the treatment. Low doses given in a single session are safe and effective, and reduce distress and inconvenience associated with repeated session. Radioisotopes are more imprecise in delivering specific doses of radiation, but have less toxicity and easy administration as well as effectiveness in subclinical sites of metastases, although storage, dispensing and administration should be under strict control. Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy are difficult to measure in terms of pain relief. Prophylactic fixation surgery can lead to improved survival and quality of life of patients with bone metastases. Surgical treatment should be undertaken when fracture occurs. Careful selection of patients for surgical spinal decompression is required. The potential benefits of surgical interventions have to be tempered with patient survival. The use of analgesics according to the WHO ladder is recommended. There is no clear evidence that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a specific efficacy in malignant bone pain. The difficulty with incident pain is not a lack of response to systemic opioids, but rather that the doses required to control the incidental pain produce unacceptable side-effects at rest. Alternative measures are often required. The inhibition of bone resorption and hypercalcaemia can be reduced by the use of bisphosphonates. This class of drugs potentiate the effects of analgesics in improving metastatic bone pain. Invasive techniques are rarely indicated, but may provide analgesia in the treatment of pain resistant to the other modalities. Neural blockade should never be used as the sole modality for malignant bone pain, but should be considered as a helpful in specific pain situations. Careful appraisal and the application of a correct approach should enable the patient with bone metastases to obtain an acceptable pain relief despite the advanced nature of their malignant disease."

CD008686,0,9082475,0,[Diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome].,"This article reviews the pathogenesis and clinical and imaging findings in shoulder impingement syndrome. Shoulder impingement is caused by compression of the supraspinatus tendon underneath the coracoacromial arch, mainly in forward flexion of the arm. Different stages of impingement syndrome are described. Stage I relates to edema and hemorrhage of the supraspinatus tendon. Stage II is characterized by bursal inflammation and fibrosis, as well as tendinopathy. In stage III there is a tear of the rotator cuff. Clinical signs may overlap. Moreover, calcifying tendinitis, fractures and pain originating from the cervical spine may mimic shoulder impingement syndrome. Imaging is important for the exact diagnosis. Standard radiographs are the basis of imaging in shoulder impingement syndrome. They may demonstrate subchondral sclerosis of the major tuberosity, subacromial spurs, and form anomalies of the acromion. They are also important in the differential diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome and demonstrate calcifying tendinitis, fractures and neoplasm. Ultrasonography has found acceptance as a screening tool and even as a final diagnostic method by many authors. However, there is a high interobserver variability in the demonstration of rotator cuff tears. Its usefulness has therefore been questioned. MR imaging is probably the method of choice in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and surrounding structures. Several investigations have demonstrated that differentiation of early findings, such as tendinopathy versus partial tears, may be difficult with MR imaging. However, reproducibility for fullthickness tears appears to be higher than for sonography. Moreover, specificity appears to be superior to sonography. MR arthrography is not universally accepted. However, it allows for more exact differentiation of discrete findings and may be indicated in preoperative planning. Standard arthrography and CT have a limited role in the current assessment of the rotator cuff."
CD008686,0,9082193,0,[Sacral intradural arachnoid cysts as the cause of lumbar syndrome].,In two female individuals (37 and 47 years old) sacral intradural arachnoid cysts caused low back pain and sciatica for several years until the correct diagnosis was established by MR imaging. Both patients had micturition disturbances (pollakisuria). In both cases a sacral laminectomy was carried out and the dorsal border of the cyst wall was resected (marsupialisation) after evacuation of xanthochrome fluid. Neither cysts showed any communication with the subarachnoid space. Postoperatively the patients were free of complaints; pollakisuria disappeared within 2-4 weeks.
CD008686,0,9008811,0,Occult spinal dysraphism--the common combination of lesions and the clinical manifestations in 50 patients.,"Fifty patients (26 males, 24 females) aged from birth to 51 years with occult spinal dysraphism were identified. All had Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans carried out. The MR scans were examined to determine the vertebral level of the conus and to see if one or more of the following were present; lipoma, syrinx, dermoid, diastematomyelia, and meningocele. In 43 patients the conus lay below the level of L3, 23 had a lipoma, 23 a meningocele, 20 an open central canal in the spinal cord or a syrinx, 15 a diastematomyelia and 4 a dermoid. The commonest combination of lesions was a long cord, a syrinx or an open central canal in the spinal cord and a lipoma. The diastematomyelias were always associated with a long cord and had the highest incidence of vertebral body anomalies (60%). The most frequent recorded signs were deformities of the feet, short legs, wasting of the calf muscles, weakness of the legs, back pain and bladder dysfunction. Combinations of these occurred with all of the lesions although some had none. Whilst deterioration was seen in about half of the patients, acute deterioration was uncommon and was associated most frequently with a dermoid or an expanded syrinx."
CD008686,0,9008036,0,Two cases of small cell carcinoma of the prostate.,"We describe the clinical and pathological findings in two Japanese men with small cell carcinoma of the prostate; case 1 was 58 years old and case 2 was 24 years old. Case 1 was initially diagnosed as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate, stage D2, with marked elevation of serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CA 19-9 levels. The patient had undergone castration and systemic chemotherapy. After three courses of chemotherapy, tumour markers were normalized. However, 6 months later serum levels of tumour markers again rose, and biopsy of the prostate revealed a small cell carcinoma component in the adenocarcinoma of the prostate and benign prostate hypertrophy. The patient was again treated with systemic chemotherapy but died within 1 year after relapse. In case 2, the patient presented with initial symptoms of lumbago and dysuria, and an enlarged prostate was radiologically diagnosed. Shortly after admission he developed ileus, and an exploratory laparotomy revealed a large tumour arising from the prostate and invading the peritoneal cavity. This tumour was pathologically diagnosed as a small cell carcinoma. The patient died shortly thereafter without responding to chemotherapy. Immunohistological evaluation was done using a panel of antibodies against NSE, chromogranin A, CEA, CA 19-9, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), leukocyte common antigen (LCA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), calcitonin, serotonin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and glucagon. CEA was intensely positive in the tumour lesions from case 1, and NSE and ACTH were focally positive, and calcitonin, serotonin, CA 19-9, and PSA were weakly positive only in several cells in the tumour lesions from case 1. In the tumour lesion from case 2, NSE was intensely positive, and chromogranin A was weakly positive. These findings support the neuroendocrine nature of this neoplasm."
CD008686,0,8990484,0,"[A 91-year-old man with a stroke, hypertension, and renal failure].","We report a 91-year-old man who had a stroke and died of renal failure. He had been treated for hypertension since 20 years before the onset of the present illness. In addition, he was operated on a gastric cancer 17 years previously. Otherwise he was doing well until May 29, 1991 (when he was 87-year-old) when he had sudden onset of dysarthria and right facial weakness. He was admitted to our hospital. On admission, general physical examination was unremarkable, and neurologic examination revealed a mentally sound man with slight dysarthria, right facial weakness, orolingual dyskinesia, and dysequilibrium in which he showed difficulty in tandem gait; however, no cerebellar ataxia was noted. A cranial CT scan revealed leukoaraiosis with multiple low density areas in the cerebral white matter. His BUN was 37 mg/dl and Cr 2.2 mg/dl. His neurologic symptoms cleared within the next few weeks and he was discharged with ticlopidine 100 mg q.d.. He had been doing well after the discharge except for gradual worsening of his renal function; his BUN was 65 mg/dl and Cr 3.27 mg/dl in April of 1994. On March 10, 1995, he fell down and hit his back; he became unable to walk because of pain, and he was admitted again on March 16, 1995. On admission, his blood pressure was 170/80 mmHg. There was an 1 + pitting pretibial edema; otherwise general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed an alert and oriented man, however, Hasegawa's dementia scale was 23/30. Higher cerebral functions as well as cranial nerves were intact. He showed some unsteadiness of gait, however, no motor weakness or ataxia was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished, but Chaddock sign was positive bilaterally. Vibration was diminished in the feet, however, pain and touch sensations were intact. Laboratory examination revealed a compression fracture of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. Blood count and chemistries were as follows; Hb 7.6 g/dl, Hct 23.3%, TP 6.0 g/dl, Alb 3.6 g/dl, BUN 87 mg/dl, Cr 4.53 mg/dl, T-Chol 174 mg/dl, HDL-Chol 49 mg/dl, Glu 156 mg/dl, Na 142 mEq/L, K 5.4 mEq/L, Cl 115 mEq/L. A urine specimen contained 1 + protein and 1 + glucose, and the sediments contained hyaline casts. A cranial CT scan was essentially same as that taken four years ago. His hospital course was complicated with pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and progressive renal failure. He was treated with intravenous fluid, chemotherapy, and other supportive measures, however, he expired from respiratory failure on April 30, 1995. He was discussed in a neurologic CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had Binswanger's disease in the brain, benign nephrosclerosis from arteriolosclerosis due to hypertension, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia. Opinions were divided regarding the question as to whether or not this patient had Binswanger's disease. Although his cranial CT scan revealed leukoaraiosis, his dementia and gait disturbance was only mild until his fall on March, 1995. Clinical features did not conform to those of Binswanger's disease. Postmortem examination of the right hemisphere revealed wide spread atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis. The kidney showed benign nephrosclerosis due to arteriolosclerosis. Sclerotic changes were also seen in the coronary arteries and the left middle cerebral artery with 70% stenosis. Myelin stain showed diffuse myelin pallor of the cerebral white matters with scattered small infarcts. Arterioles in the white matter showed arteriolosclerosis. Small infarcts were also seen in the putamen and in the thalamus. This patient appeared to have had circulatory disturbance of the white matter which is the basic abnormality causing Binswanger's disease. However, white matter changes in this patient were not quite severe enough to make a pathologic diagnosis of Binswanger's disease."
CD008686,0,8977052,0,Health hazards of obesity.,"Several health hazards and social disabilities are associated with obesity. Increased mortality is associated with increased body weight. A high rate of mortality results from heart disease, diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, high blood pressure, and cancer. Physiologic cardiovascular changes occur, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy and lipid abnormalities. Hypertension, stroke, and venous stasis are increased. Pulmonary abnormalities include obstructive sleep apnea, which can be associated with secondary polycythemia and right ventricular hypertrophy. Gallstones, gallbladder disease, and accumulation of fat on the liver are significantly increased. Gout and reproductive abnormalities in women are common. Osteoarthritis of the knees and spine occur, although osteoporosis is rare. Risk for endometrial and breast cancer is increased, particularly in the presence of increased central fat. Changes in the skin include stretch marks, acanthosis negricans, hirsutism, intertrigo, and multiple papillomas. Impaired psychosocial function is manifested as social isolation, loss of job mobility, increased employee absenteeism, and economic and social discrimination."

CD008686,0,8929490,0,Suprascapular nerve entrapment: experience with 28 cases.,"Suprascapular nerve entrapment (SNE) in the suprascapular notch is a rare entity that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of radicular pain, as well as that of shoulder discomfort. Over a period of 10 years (1985-1995), the authors treated 28 cases of SNE in 27 patients by surgical decompression of the nerve. One patient underwent operation bilaterally within 5 years. Five patients presented with a history of trauma to the shoulder region. In three patients, a ganglion cyst was the origin of the nerve lesion. In 16 patients, the nerve problem was primarily related to athletic activities. Eight of these patients were professional volleyball players. In the remaining three patients, there was no relationship between the nerve lesion and trauma or athletic activities. Twenty-one patients (22 cases) complained of pain located over the suprascapular notch. Seventeen patients had paresis and atrophy of both the supraspinatus (SS) and infraspinatus (IS) muscles. In 10 patients only the IS muscle was involved. One patient exhibited a sensory deficit over the posterior portion of the shoulder. Electromyography was performed in all cases. The mean follow-up period in the 25 cases (24 patients) that could be evaluated was 20.8 months (range 3-70 months). Nineteen of 22 cases with preoperative pain could be evaluated. Sixteen of these patients were completely free of pain after surgery and three patients found their pain had improved. Motor function in the SS muscle improved in 86.7% and motor function in the IS muscle in 70.8% of cases. Atrophy of the SS muscle resolved in 80.7% and atrophy of the IS muscle in 50% of cases. Surgical treatment of SNE is indicated after failed conservative treatment and in cases of atrophy of the SS and IS muscles. The authors recommend the posterior approach, which minimizes risks and complications and produces good postoperative results."

CD008686,0,8915786,0,Altered mineral metabolism and bone mass in children during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) often develop bone pain, abnormal gait, and unusual fractures while in remission and receiving continuing chemotherapy. A prospective longitudinal cohort study was undertaken of bone mass and biochemical mineral status in 40 consecutive children (27 male, 13 female, aged 0.3-17.0 years) receiving therapy on the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute protocol 87-01. Radiography, lumbar spine dual-photon absorptiometry, and biochemical measurements of mineral status were performed at diagnosis and at 6-month intervals throughout 24 months of chemotherapy. Eleven patients were not completely evaluated (4 deaths and 7 off study). Radiographic evidence of osteopenia was observed in 10, 64, and 76% at diagnosis, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Fractures occurred in 39% of children during treatment. Reduction in bone mineral content (BMC), as measured by Z scores, occurred in 64% of patients and was most severe in those greater than 11 years of age at diagnosis. Reduction in BMC during the first 6 months of therapy had a positive predictive value of 64%, while an increase in BMC had a negative predictive value of 82% for subsequent fracture. By 6 months of therapy, 31/37 (84%) children were hypomagnesemic, of whom 16 (52%) were hypermagnesuric. Plasma osteocalcin was subnormal at diagnosis in 29/40 (73%) but increased to normal by 6 months of treatment. Vitamin D status was normal throughout, but plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D remained subnormal in greater than 70% of children. Urinary cross-link N-telopeptide was normal at diagnosis and became elevated in 58% of children by the end of therapy. Suppressed bone mineralization is evident at diagnosis in a minority of children with ALL. Skeletal morbidity and a reduction in bone mineral mass become more prevalent during treatment, with increased bone resorption, perhaps mainly as a consequence of corticosteroid administration."
CD008686,0,8900353,0,Evaluating the child with back pain.,"The most common causes of serious low back pain in children include spondylolysis, Scheuermann disease and musculoligamentous injury. Questions should be asked about the mechanism of onset and exacerbating factors, and the frequency, duration and severity of the pain. The examination should check gait and alignment, flexibility, strength and reflexes, and localize and evaluate the pain. Warning signs of serious problems include constant pain in a child younger than 11 years of age that lasts for several weeks or occurs spontaneously at night, repeatedly interferes with school, play or sports, or is associated with marked stiffness and limitation of motion, fever or neurologic abnormalities. Pain at the lumbosacral junction may suggest spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. Scheuermann disease is diagnosed by the observance of wedging, irregularity or growth disturbance of three successive vertebrae. Musculoligamentous pain may result from injury to or overuse of muscles or joints of the back. Rare causes include discitis, tuberculosis, bone or spinal cord tumor, pyelonephritis and retroperitoneal infection."
CD008686,0,9086485,0,Neurological investigations in 23 cases of pyrethroid intoxication reported to the German Federal Health Office.,"In 1993, 64 cases of chronic pyrethroid intoxication were reported to the Federal Health Office in Germany. Shortly afterwards the media spoke of thousands of cases of pyrethroid intoxication in homes. 23 of the persons reported were examined in a neurological department on an inpatient basis using clinical neurological, neuroradiological and laboratory investigations, including the examination of pyrethroid values in blood and urine. The pyrethroid exposure involved carpets, moth killers, pesticide sprays and wood preservatives. Nine of the cases presented with severe somatic or psychiatric disorders with completely different clinical diagnoses, such as pituitary tumor, radiogenic lumbosacral plexus paralysis, Guillain- Barré syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, with no plausible relationship to exposure. Eight cases presented with multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome (MCS) and normal somatic findings. In six of the cases, a causal link between acute complaints and pyrethroid exposure could be established or not ruled out. There was, however, not a single case in which evidence for irreversible PNS or CNS lesions could be found."
CD008686,0,9046202,0,Spinal epidural non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: case reports of three patients presenting with spinal cord compression.,"Spinal epidural non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is an uncommon lesion. In this report, we describe three patients with a clinical picture of acute spinal cord compression as the first presentation of malignant lymphoma. The diagnosis was not suspected pre-operatively, and plain radiographs of the spine were either normal or not specific. Neuroimaging showed evidence of extradural soft tissue mass crossing multiple vertebral segments. In the light of these radiological findings, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma should be a diagnostic consideration in the older patient without prior history of malignancy who presents with a prodrome of back pain followed by spinal cord compression."
CD008686,0,8980890,0,Acutely exacerbated hypertension and increased inflammatory signs due to radiation treatment for metastatic pheochromocytoma.,"Hypertension and norepinephrine hypersecretion in a 59-year-old woman suffering from malignant pheochromocytoma with multiple metastases were appropriately controlled with alpha- and beta- blockers, and alpha-methyltyrosine (alpha-MT), a catecholamine-synthesis inhibitor. Metastasized vertebrae were treated with external radiation to relieve pain, but this treatment had to be interrupted at a total dose of 20 Gy because the patient suffered acutely exacerbated hypertension (200/110 mmHg), tachycardia (160 beats/min) and a low-grade fever. Simultaneously her serum levels of LDH, potassium, urea nitrogen, creatinine, white blood cell count, CRP and norepinephrine were significantly increased, suggesting that this episode was due to radiation-induced tissue destruction and the leakage of catecholamines and possibly interleukin-6, a cytokine mediating inflammation which is reportedly present in pheochromocytoma. The marked hypertension was controlled by continuous i.v. administration of phentolamine and propranolol. Although radiation therapy effectively relieves pain due to neoplasmic metastasis to the bone, physicians should be aware that life-threatening complications such as the above occur in malignant pheochromocytoma. Sufficient pretreatment with adrenergic blocking agents and/or alpha-MT and careful monitoring of the patient's general condition during radiation therapy, even at a low dose, are highly recommended."

Child and parent distress, assessed by questionnaires and ratings, were compared in two arms of a randomized, controlled prospective study, one a pharmacologic only (PO) (n = 45) and the other a combined pharmacologic and psychological intervention (Cl) (n = 47), at 1, 2, and 6 months after diagnosis. The cross-sectional control group (CC) consisted of parents of 70 patients in first remission prior to the prospective study. Mothers' and nurses' ratings of child distress indicated less child distress in the Cl group than the PO. When contrasted with the CC group, the Cl group showed lower levels of child distress. Data showed decreases over time in distress and concurrent improvements in quality of life and parenting stress and supported an inverse association between distress and child age."
CD008686,0,8916983,0,Add-back therapy for long-term use in dysfunctional uterine bleeding and uterine fibroids.,"The gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are an efficacious medical approach for the management of both dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) and uterine fibroids. However, due to the long-term effects of GnRH agonists on bone mass, their use is restricted to short courses. Add-back hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is one strategy that could minimise the hypo-oestrogenic effects of GnRH agonists, without nullifying their therapeutic effects. In one study of add-back therapy with cyclical oestradiol/norgestrol in combination with Zoladex (goserelin acetate) in women with subjective DUB, the duration of menstruation, the number of days of heavy bleeding and objective blood loss were all significantly (P < 0.001) reduced. There was also significant (P < 0.001) symptomatic improvement. Furthermore, in 51 patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids, combined oestrogen/progestogen given for 21 months after initial GnRH agonist treatment for 3 months did not promote fibroid regrowth. In contrast, in women randomised to progestogen only, there was a gradual increase in uterine volume. The combination of GnRH agonists and add-back HRT appears beneficial for women with either DUB or fibroids."
CD008686,0,8914156,0,[A case of cystic hemangioblastoma of the medulla oblongata].,"Cystic hemangioblastoma of the brain stem is an extremely rare clinical entity. Only eight cases have been reported in the literature. This is a report of a case of successful extirpation of a cystic hemangioblastoma of the medulla oblongata. A 47-year-old man was admitted to our clinic with the complaint of progressive numbness on his left upper limb since January 1995. Neurological examination revealed numbness and decreased vibration sensation on his left upper limb. MRI showed a cystic 1.5 x 2.0 cm lesion on the medulla oblongata, and with administration of Gd-DTPA, a small mass lesion on the dorsolateral side of the medulla oblongata. Left vertebral angiogram revealed a tumor fed directly from the left vertebral artery. An operation was performed using a suboccipital approach. The dorsal surface of the medulla was swollen edematously, suggesting the site of a cyst, which emptied by means of opening the wall. The reddish tumor was embedded on the left dorsolateral surface of the medulla oblongate. A total extirpation of the tumor was carried out under microscopic procedure. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a hemangioblastoma. The patient was free from his distressing numbness immediately after the operation, and discharged without neurological deficit."
CD008686,0,8883446,0,Back pain in children.,"Pay attention to back pain reported by children. Half will have a specific or serious cause, the presenting symptoms of serious conditions may be misleadingly mild, and the spectrum of causes and mode of presentation differ from adults. Warning features include onset aged < 4 yr, symptoms persisting beyond 4 weeks, interference with function, systemic features, worsening pain, neurological features and recent onset of scoliosis. Scintigraphy is often useful where clinical features and plain radiographs fail to identify the diagnosis. Sports activities may cause stress reactions in the immature spine, particularly at the junction between spinal segments of differing mobility, the vascularity of the disc and vertebra predisposes to infection, spinal tumours presenting as pain tend to be primary and benign, congenital spinal anomalies causing pain tend to present in childhood, spondylitis presents differently from adults, and conversion hysteria, typically presenting with gross, bizarre and disabling symptoms, is not uncommon in adolescent girls."

CD008686,0,8857717,0,Intramedullary spinal cord metastases: clinical features and treatment outcome.,"Our objective was to delineate clinical features and treatment outcome of patients with intramedullary spinal cord metastasis (ISCM). There are no reports of a large experience with this rare cancer complication. We reviewed records retrospectively from 1980 to 1993 to identify patients with histologically confirmed systemic cancer, clinical features of myelopathy, and either tissue-proven ISCM or abnormal neuroimaging findings consistent with ISCM. We identified 40 patients who fulfilled these criteria. In nine, ISCM was the initial presentation of cancer. Nineteen patients had lung primaries (small cell in 12). Twenty-one patients had pain, 35 had demonstrable sensory loss, 37 had weakness, and 25 had urinary incontinence at presentation. Nine patients had true Brown-Séquard syndrome and nine others had pseudo-Brown-Séquard syndrome. Median duration of symptoms at diagnosis was 28 days (range 3 days to 18 months). Thirteen patients had prior brain metastasis, nine had brain metastasis simultaneous with ISCM, and one had brain metastasis after ISCM; 11 had concomitant leptomeningeal metastases. Spinal magnetic resonance findings were abnormal in 30/30 patients, myelographic results were abnormal in 16/20, and eight had pathologic confirmation of ISCM. Thirty-five patients had radiotherapy and five had surgery; four were untreated or treated elsewhere. Median survival was 4 months for patients receiving radiotherapy and 2 months for patients not receiving radiotherapy. Eleven patients survived > 6 months. Twenty-three were ambulatory at ISCM diagnosis, and 21 were ambulatory at letest follow-up. We conclude that ISCM as the initial presentation of malignancy is not rare, and hemicord syndromes occur frequently. Although long-term survival is poor, treatment preserves ambulation in most patients still ambulatory at diagnosis. Focal radiotherapy is indicated in most patients."

To determine the role of instability, a retrospective review of charts identified 60 facet cysts in 56 patients treated over a 6-year period. Three patients developed an asynchronous cyst at the same level but on the opposite side of the previously resected cyst and one patient had a recurrent cyst in the same location. Forty-one cysts were present in patients with radiculopathy and 16 in patients with neurogenic claudication. Two patients presented with myelopathy and one had cauda equina syndrome. Thirty-six of the 60 cysts were located at L4-5, the most mobile segment. Fifteen patients had spondylolisthesis, of whom two experienced worsening spondylolisthesis postoperatively. Seven patients had scoliosis and 20 had systemic arthritis. Fifty-five cysts were resected via mesial facetectomy. Six of the patients undergoing this procedure had transverse process fusions at initial surgery for preoperative instability. Two others required fusion for post-operative instability and increased spondylolisthesis. Follow-up review was available in 95% of patients with an average duration of 12 months. Forty patients had excellent relief of symptoms, 12 had occasional back pain, and one patient did poorly. Flexion/extension views of the spine are recommended both pre- and postoperatively to identify the need for fusion in patients with juxtafacet cysts."

CD008686,0,9109993,0,Intramedullary spinal cord paracoccidioidomycosis. Report of two cases.,"Two cases of intramedullary paracoccidioidomycosis are reported. Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic disease that involves the buccopharyngeal mucosa, lungs lymph nodes and viscera and infrequently the central nervous system. Localization in the spinal cord is rare. Case 1: a 55-year old male admitted with crural pararesis, tactile/painful hypesthesia and sphincter disturbances of 15 days duration. Cutaneous-pulmonary blastomycosis was diagnosed 17 years ago. Myelotomography showed a blockade of T3-T4 (intramedullary lesion). The lesion surgically removed was a Paracoccidioides brasiliensis granuloma. Treatment with sulfadiazine was started after the surgery. Follow-up of 15 month showed an improvement of the clinical signs. Case 2: a 57-year old male was admitted elsewhere 6 months ago and, with a radiologic diagnosis of pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis, was treated with amphotericin B. He progressively developer paresthesia and tactile/pain anaesthesia on the left side, sphincter disturbances and tetraparesis with bilateral extensor plantar response and clonus of the feet. Myelotomography showed a blockade of C4-C6 (intramedullary lesion). The lesion was not found during surgical exploration and the patient deteriorated and died. Post-mortem examination revealed an intramedullary tumor above the site of the mielotomy (Paracoccidioides brasiliensis granuloma). The preoperative diagnosis of intramedullary paracoccidioidomycotic granulomas is difficult because the clinical and radiologic manifestations are uncharacteristic. Clinical suspicion was possible in our cases based on the history of previous systemic disease. Contrary to intracranial localizations, paracoccidioidomycotic granulomas causing progressive spinal cord compression may require early surgery because response to clinical treatment is slow and the reversibility of neurological deficits depends on the promptness of the decompression."
CD008686,0,8976658,0,Difficulties in diagnosing intrinsic spinal cord tumours.,"Thirteen children with intrinsic spinal cord tumours were seen between 1984 and 1995. In only one was this the presumptive diagnosis at referral, despite a high incidence of characteristic features. Eight had presented to their local paediatrician, four to local orthopaedic teams, and one to a general surgeon. Eleven had back pain. Eleven had either spinal curvature or change in gait. The interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis ranged from one week to six years, with a mean of 17.5 months. In nine children symptoms had been present for four or more months.

Long-term follow-up after treatment with arthrodesis.,"We evaluated the results for fifteen patients in whom symptomatic osteoarthrosis of the atlanto-axial joints had been treated with an atlanto-axial or occipitocervical arthrodesis between 1973 and 1990. Thirteen patients had long-term follow-up (average duration, seven years and two months; range, four years and two months to nineteen years and two months). The two remaining patients had died: one, four days postoperatively, from a cardiopulmonary arrest, and the other, one year and eight months postoperatively, from complications related to bladder cancer. Preoperatively, all fifteen patients reported pain in the occipitocervical region that increased with any attempt at rotation of the neck and was unresponsive to immobilization with a collar and to analgesics. The average duration of the symptoms before the arthrodesis was three years. One patient had acute quadriparesis. All patients had radiographic evidence of oesteoarthrosis involving the lateral atlanto-axial articulations. Four patients had atlanto-axial instability with an average of five millimeters (range, three to ten millimeters) of motion at the anterior atlanto-odontoid interval. Six patients had an associated spontaneous subaxial fusion, which was secondary to osteoarthrosis in five; three of the five also had atlanto-axial instability. Fourteen patients were managed with a posterior arthrodesis and one, with an anterior transoral arthrodesis. The procedures were performed to relieve pain, to stabilize the atlanto-axial joints, and to restore neurological function. Of the fourteen patients who were followed, thirteen had a solid fusion and one had a stable pseudarthrosis. The patient who had quadriparesis recovered. At the latest follow-up evaluation, thirteen patients had an excellent result and one had a fair result as determined with use of a modification of the criteria of Robinson et al. There were no poor results. Atlanto-axial arthrodesis can effectively relieve occipitocervical pain and correct atlanto-axial instability secondary to osteoarthrosis."

The varied etiologies and the necessary diagnostic workup are illustrated in 8 children. Infectious processes were found in 3 children, spondylodiscitis twice and epidural abscess once. Tumours (one eosinophilic granuloma and one spinal ependymoma) were present in 2 boys. One girl had a herniated lumbar disc. Malformations (spondylolysis and diastematomyelia) were the cause of symptoms in 2 children. Leading symptom in all 8 children was back pain lasting from 3 days to 2 years. Careful clinical neurological examination, parameters of inflammation in the blood and conventional radiography of the spine were helpful in guiding further investigations. Scintigraphy was useful for localization of infectious and tumorous diseases. MRI was superior to CT in evaluating tumours and malformations of the spinal cord. In most cases CT was sufficient in workup of infectious and osseous processes."
CD008686,0,8893229,0,Congenital mediastinal bronchogenic cyst with malignant transformation: an autopsy report.,"A rare autopsy case of mediastinal bronchogenic cyst with malignant transformation is presented. The cyst had been located in the anterior mediastinum for at least 28 years in a 52 year old male. Chest X-ray findings showing rapid enlargement of the cyst and biopsy of the spine for lumbago made a clinical diagnosis as suspicious mediastinal cystic teratoma with malignant transformation metastasizing to the spine. Postmortem examination revealed that the cyst was located in the anterior mediastinum extending to the left pulmonary hilum and had no connection with the tracheobronchial tree. The cyst wall consisted of bronchus-like tissue including ciliated epithelium, hyaline cartilage, smooth muscle and mucoserous glands. There were no teratomatous components in the wall. Malignant tumor predominantly consisting of round cells occurred in the thickened cyst wall and grew into the cyst cavity with direct invasion of the lung and metastases to the liver, adrenal glands, bone marrow of the lumbar spine and lymph nodes. An immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells frequently expressed cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen and carcino-embryonic antigen, occasionally CA19-9, vimentin and neuron-specific enolase. From these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as undifferentiated carcinoma arising in the mediastinal bronchogenic cyst."
CD008686,0,8844907,0,Chronic low back pain.,"Most episodes of low back pain are mechanical in origin and resolve within a 12-week period. These acute episodes of back pain are associated with muscle strain and intervertebral disc herniation with radiculopathy. A smaller proportion of individuals have back pain with a duration greater than 12 weeks. These patients have back pain secondary to a wide variety of mechanical and nonmechanical disorders. The mechanical disorders associated with chronic low back pain include osteoarthritis and lumbar spinal stenosis; the nonmechanical disorders include infectious, neoplastic, rheumatologic, endocrinologic, vascular, and gynecologic. The clinical symptoms associated with each variety of disorder helps guide the appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Plain roentgenograms are useful in documenting the presence of spinal stenosis, benign or malignant tumors, osteoporosis, sacroiliitis, and spondylitis. CT scan is helpful in defining the bony alterations associated with malignant tumors and the vascular abnormalities associated with aneurysms. MR imaging is the technique of choice to document the extent of malignant processes and the presence of endometriosis in the pelvis. The therapy of these entities are specific for the disease entity causing the chronic low back pain. Although most of the disorders that cause chronic low back pain cannot be cured, therapy can decrease pain and improve function of the symptomatic patient."
CD008686,0,8813273,0,Contribution of nerve biopsy findings to the diagnosis of disabling neuropathy in the elderly. A retrospective review of 100 consecutive patients.,"Peripheral neuropathy is an important factor of disability in the elderly. In order to learn more on the usefulness of intensive evaluation of patients over 65 years of age with subacute or chronic disabling peripheral neuropathy, we reviewed the clinical and nerve biopsy findings of the last 100 patients of this age group who suffered from a peripheral neuropathy severe enough to justify performance of a nerve biopsy for a diagnostic or prognostic purpose. Normal nerve biopsy findings led to the diagnosis of lower motor neuron disease in three patients and pointed to lesions of the spinal roots in six other patients. Necrotizing arteritis was demonstrated in the biopsy specimens of 23 patients, and non-necrotizing vasculitis in five. In five additional patients the diagnosis of vasculitic neuropathy was kept in spite of non-contributive biopsy findings. In two diabetic patients who had a multifocal neuropathy the biopsy also revealed the presence of vasculitis. Thus 35% of the patients included in this series had one form or another of vasculitic neuropathy. Fourteen patients had a chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. In 11 patients the neuropathy was associated with monoclonal gammopathy, which was benign in nine and associated with malignant plasma cell dyscrasia in two. Among the six patients with diabetes mellitus, two patients who presented with a multifocal neuropathy were found to have vasculitis in the nerve specimen; in the others the biopsy was performed because of uncommonly severe pains or motor involvement due to an extremely severe diabetic neuropathy. Six patients suffered from a long-lasting disability secondary to a drug-induced neuropathy. The remaining 15% had neuropathies of different origin, including amyloidosis, lepromatous leprosy, carcinomatous neuropathy and alcoholic neuropathy. Six patients had a mild, non-progressive or slowly progressive axonopathy of unknown origin, ageing of the peripheral nervous system may have played a role in its development. Our findings show that vasculitis is an important and treatable cause of disabling neuropathy in the elderly and that the proportion of patients with severe neuropathy of unknown origin is small."
CD008686,0,8753709,0,Osteoma of the long bones and the spine. A study of eleven patients and a review of the literature.,"The clinical features, radiographic and histopathological findings, treatment, and results are described for eleven patients who were managed for an extracranial osteoma at our medical center between 1980 and 1993. Ten of the patients were initially seen because of dull, aching bone pain that had been present for two weeks to thirty years. Radiographs demonstrated single or multiple homogeneous, well defined, radiodense foci with smooth round or lobulated margins. The histopathological features consistently included uniformly dense, compact, cortical-like, mature lamellar bone. The preoperative diagnosis was unclear for all patients, and osteoma was rarely considered in the differential diagnosis. For four patients, a tentative diagnosis of osteosarcoma was made, and a wide excision was carried out in two of these patients. Marginal excision with less than three millimeters of normal tissue around the lesion was performed in most patients. None of the osteomas recurred, and ten patients had relief of the pain. Awareness of the clinical, radiographic, and histopathological features of osteoma, as described, is valuable for making a differential diagnosis and for distinguishing osteomas from other lesions."

CD008686,0,8868941,0,[Multiple myeloma and bone manifestations. Role of clodronate].,"Osteolytic lesions in multiple myeloma are related to osteoclast activation induced by a network of cytokines including IL6, TNF beta or IL1 beta which explain pain, fractures, or hypercalcaemia appearance. Bone destruction is reflected by hydroxyprolinuria and inversely correlated with serum osteocalcin. Lytic lesions or osteopenia are present in 80% of patients on X-ray. MR imaging, is interesting for exploring spinal lesions or the so-called solitary plasmacytomas but still remains a tool in evaluation. After therapies few modifications are demonstrated on roetgenograms while osteodensitometry appears more sensitive. A review of the literature is made showing the prominent place of clodronate in the therapy of hypercalcaemia of multiple myeloma. This drug appears attractive for decreasing osteolysis and perhaps for improving quality of life of patients. Nevertheless, a better definition of its use in clinical practice is necessary."

CD008686,0,8776965,0,"[Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome: a study of comparisons between laparoscopic and open adrenalectomy, and laparoscopic adrenalectomy for differing adrenal tumors].","In order to evaluate the utility of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome, the results of 6 laparoscopic adrenalectomies for Cushing's syndrome were compared with those of 34 other laparoscopic adrenalectomies, consisting of 7 pre-Cushing's syndromes, 13 primary aldosteronisms, and 14 non-functioning adrenal tumors. The results were also compared with 5 open adrenalectomies for Cushing's syndrome. The results of the laparoscopic adrenalectomies for Cushing's syndrome were as follows: the mean operating time was 216 +/- 46 min, and the mean estimated blood loss was 180 +/- 194 ml. From the third patient, an ultrasonic surgical system was used and the estimated blood loss decreased significantly. The ultrasonic surgical system, together with a more experienced surgical technique, also cut down the operating times. During surgical intervention, 2 complications occurred; a hemorrhage of more than 500 ml in one patient, and splenic injury in another, which was treated by compression. Postoperative complications occurred in 2 patients; paralytic ileus in one, and abdominal pain due to the pneumoperitoneum in the other. All patients except 2 patients with vertebral fracture began oral intake and ambulation 1 to 4 days postoperatively, and resumed normal daily activity on postoperative day 5 to 7. Compared with the laparoscopic adrenalectomies for the other adrenal tumors, the operating time and estimated blood loss in the Cushing's syndrome patients was not substantially different, though postoperative recovery was slightly longer. When compared with the open adrenalectomies, the operating time was longer, but the postoperative recovery period was significantly shorter. We conclude that with careful surgical intervention, experience of technique, and the introduction of proper equipment, a laparoscopic adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome can be performed as less-invasively as a laparoscopic adrenalectomy is for the other adrenal tumors. Furthermore, our findings suggest that laparoscopic adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome is likelier to have better postoperative results than conventional procedures, including a more rapid recovery to normal daily activity."
CD008686,0,8752872,0,[Clinical study of intraspinal neoplasms in children].,"The authors report a series of 10 children under 15 years of age with primary intraspinal neoplasm who underwent surgical resection from 1981 to 1994. The tumors consisted of 4 intramedullary tumors (myxopapillary ependymoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, subpial liporna, cavernous angioma), 2 intradural extramedullary tumors (2 neurinomas), and 4 extradural tumors (ganglioneuroma, chordoma, osteochondroma, rhabdomyosarcoma). The initial symptoms in these patients were gait disturbance (50%), weakness of lower extremities (50%), pain (40%), weakness of upper extremities (10%), and tetraparesis (10%). The neurological findings on admission in these patients revealed motor paresis (90%), sensory disturbance (60%), abnormality of deep tendon reflex (60%), pathological reflex (30%), neurogenic bladder (30%), and Lasegue's sign (10%). All patients were treated surgically; laminectoy was performed in 8 patients, laminoplasty in one patient, and transoral approach in one patient. Five patients (50%) underwent a grossly total resection, 3 (30%) had a subtotal resection, and 2 (20%) had a partial resection. Mean follow-up period was 5.6 years. One (10%) patient died due to recurrence and dissemination of the tumor at eight months after surgery in a case of rhabdomyosarcoma. 9 (90%) have had no recurrent tumor and have improved neurologically. In 4 patients (40%) spinal deformity developed, and 2 patients required operative treatment for the spinal deformity. We emphasized the advantage of laminoplasty to prevent postoperative spinal deformity in children."
CD008686,0,8988495,0,Posterior fossa lateral ependymoma in childhood.,"Over a period extending from 1984 to 1993, 16 children ranging in ages from 2 months to 12 years with posterior fossa ependymoma were treated. Four of these tumors were classified as lateral ependymomas because of their configuration and suspected site of origin. These 4 patients' ages ranged from 2 months to 5 years. Signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and cranial nerve dysfunction were the hallmark of their presentation. Their imaging evaluation included a preoperative and postoperative CT san and/or MRI. A gross total surgical resection' was completed in the 4 children. At least a 1-year follow-up was available for all the patients. Intraoperative brain stem evoked potentials and facial and glossopharyngeal nerve monitoring were used in all the surgeries. Three children required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt postoperatively. Chemotherapy was used postoperatively in 3 children. The 4th child did not receive chemotherapy due to parental refusal and succumbed to a recurrence 1 years postoperatively. Radiation therapy was given to 2 children. Tumor recurrences developed in all children at 12 months, 18 months, 3 years and 4 years postoperatively in proximity to the original tumor site. Histologic sections in 3 patients, including those at the time of recurrence, were consistent with a low mitotic index. Only 1 child's histologic diagnosis was consistent with a high-grade ependymoma. The lower cranial nerve dysfunction transiently worsened in all the patients and was permanent in 2. The child's age, tumor histology and extent of resection play an important role in the prognosis of posterior fossa ependymoma. The lateral posterior fossa ependymoma has a particularly poor prognosis due to its location and its significant postoperative morbidity. The authors propose a combined midline and lateral suboccipital approach in order to expose the fourth ventricular floor, upper cervical spine, lateral recess, cerebellomedullary fissure, cerebellopontine and the cerebellomedullary cistern in an attempt at a ""total' resection with a focus on the site of origin. The usage of neurophysiological monitoring appears to be useful in limiting and predicting the extent of postoperative complications. However, prolonged morbidity is likely and is commonly related to lower cranial nerve deficits. The author proposes a proactive approach in order to limit the sequelae of these complications."
CD008686,0,8944249,0,[Painful bilateral lumbar radiculoplexopathy associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection].,"We report a case of polyneuropathy caused by primary Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection in a 57-year-old patient. The primary EBV infection was confirmed by serology tests and EBNA (Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen) seroconversion. The main clinical sign was a highly painful subacute, bilateral lumbar radiculoplexopathy with amyotrophy which responded to corticosteroids and complement treatment within a few months. The association of left facial paralysis, neurophysiological signs of polyradiculopathy and elevated protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid demonstrate the variability of peripheral neurological involvement in the same subject with EBV infection. This case also demonstrates the poorly limits of dysimmune polyneuropathies, including lumbar radiculoplexopathy which can be considered as an exceptional variant."

We found that the clinical presentation of the condition was often similar to that of malignant disease within the spine, with the commonest presenting features being back pain (95%), an evaluated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (100%) and neurological deficits (47%). The radiological appearances were diagnostic of spinal tuberculosis in less than 50% of cases. Microbiological confirmation of the diagnosis was possible only by direct analysis of tissue or pus, either at operation or from a vertebral biopsy. The difficulty of diagnosing this condition and the implications that this has on the timing and nature of surgery in patients presenting with neurological deficits are discussed."
CD008686,0,8758048,0,Fibrodysplasia (myositis) ossificans progressiva: clinicopathological features and natural history.,"Patients with fibrodysplasia (myositis) ossificans progressiva (FOP) (n = 28) were studied for up to 24 years. All had characteristic short big toes potentially recognizable at birth; there were radiographic changes in the toes, thumbs, cervical spine and metaphyses of the long bones, including exostoses. Ossification in the large skeletal muscles began from birth to 16 years (mean age 4.6 years) initially in 25 patients in the neck and upper spinal muscles, and later around the hips, major joints and jaw. The rate and extent of disability was unrelated to the time of onset. There was no evidence that any form of treatment produced consistent benefit. Despite the unique combination of skeletal abnormalities and ectopic ossification, the first diagnosis in patients with FOP was often wrong and usually delayed after ectopic ossification began (mean 2.7 years, range 0-14). Except where presentation was unusual, such as progressive stiffness, this delay was mainly due to failure to recognize the significance of the abnormal toes. The most frequent erroneous histological diagnoses were soft tissue sarcoma or fibromatosis. This series emphasizes the usually incorrect initial diagnosis, the misinterpretation of the histology, the unpredictable prognosis and the failure of current treatment. Despite its extreme rarity, there is a need for wider knowledge of this condition both to avoid clinical errors and to stimulate research."
CD008686,0,8649575,0,Spinal responses to median and tibial nerve stimulation and magnetic resonance imaging in intramedullary cord lesions.,"We recorded median and tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in 18 patients with intramedullary lesions of the cord (intramedullary tumors in 14 patients and syringomyelia cavitations in 4). Patients were divided into four groups on the basis of the longitudinal extension of the lesions as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging. The lesions involved the cervical cord in nine patients (group 1), both cervical and lumbar cord (""holocord"" lesion) in two (group 2), the dorsal cord in one (group 3), and the lumbar cord in six (group 4). The recording technique enabled us to analyze clearly the spinal SEPs, labeled for the median nerve as N13, and for the tibial nerve as N24. Both spinal responses are probably generated by the activation of dorsal horn cells and proved useful in revealing focal lesions of the cervical or lumbar cords. Median nerve N13 was abnormal in all group 1 and group 2 patients; in three patients, this was the only median SEP abnormality, suggesting that the dysfunction was limited to the cervical grey matter. Tibial nerve N24 was abnormal in all group 2 and group 4 patients. The abnormality of both cervical and lumbar segmental responses in patients with holocord lesions strongly suggested that both the cervical and lumbar cords were involved. The SEP study was often more effective than the clinical examination in revealing cord involvement and the actual extension of damage. The recording of the spinal SEPs is thus highly sensitive in assessing cord dysfunction in intramedullary lesions, providing that specific recording techniques are used."
CD008686,0,8649545,0,Chemosensitive epidural spinal cord disease in non-Hodgkins lymphoma.,"Epidural spinal cord disease (ESCD), an infrequent complication of systemic non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), can occur at diagnosis or at relapse, and is usually treated with radiotherapy, or infrequently surgical decompression. We retrospectively analyzed 140 patients with intermediate-grade NHL (IG-NHL) who were treated on a dose-intense protocol using doxorubicin, vincristine, and high-dose cyclophosphamide (NHL-15). There were seven episodes of ESCD in six (4.3%) patients. Five episodes were asymptomatic at presentation; one patient had back pain, leg numbness, and tingling; and one had radicular pain and mild leg weakness. None had malignant cells in the CSF. One patient received high-dose dexamethasone after laminectomy for diagnostic biopsy; otherwise, dexamethasone was used only as an anti-emetic prior to chemotherapy. Patients who developed ESCD at diagnosis received the planned course of NHL-15 chemotherapy as treatment for ESCD, and those treated with NHL-15 who developed ESCD at relapse were given a regimen containing ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE). After chemotherapy alone, five of seven episodes showed radiographic resolution of ESCD and improvement of neurologic deficits. One patient received consolidation radiotherapy (2,700 cGy) to the spine after ICE for relapsed ESCD and had a complete response. One patient had progression of systemic lymphoma and ESCD despite chemotherapy. These data suggest that chemotherapy may be effective as initial treatment of ESCD in IG-NHL and may reduce the potential complications of spinal surgery and radiotherapy."
CD008686,0,21544453,0,Follicular thyroid cancer.,"Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer generally have a good prognosis and high cure rates; however, subgroups of patients exist who develop progressive disease with significant morbidity and mortality. We analyzed the clinical outcome of patients with follicular thyroid cancer and distant metastases to define their presentation, impact of therapy and clinical outcome. A group of 44 patients with follicular thyroid cancer which had metastasized to the lungs or the skeleton was identified. All patients were treated at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1965 and 1994. The group included 26 women and 18 men, with a median age of 56 years (range, 23 to 80 years). The primary tumor was limited to the thyroid in most cases. At the time of writing 13 patients were alive with metastatic disease a median of 43 months (range, 4 to 230 months) after diagnosis, while 27 patients died of thyroid cancer a median of 83 months (range, 4 to 238 months) after diagnosis. Bone pain was the chief complaint in almost all the 24 patients in whom distant metastases were present at diagnosis. In the 20 patients who initially presented with localized disease, distant metastases to the skeleton and/or lungs were detected after a median interval of 53 months (range, 8 to 216 months). Symptomatic spinal cord compression occurred in 13 patients and preceded their death by 4 to 34 months. Radioiodine uptake was seen in most bone metastases but in only about half of metastatic foci in the lungs. Radiotherapy was palliative and useful for bone metastases. We conclude that patients with follicular thyroid cancer and distant metastases have a distinct clinical profile that includes prominent skeletal and pulmonary involvement and substantial morbidity and mortality. Intensive multimodality therapy is required to optimize the clinical outcome."
CD008686,0,8739655,0,The role of bisphosphonates in the treatment of bone metastases--the U.S. experience.,"Frequent complications of bone metastases include pain, pathologic fracture, hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression. Lytic bone metastases result from excessive activation of osteoclasts by tumor-produced cytokines. Aredia (pamidronate) is a potent bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast activation. In two dose-seeking phase I trials in patients with breast cancer and prostate cancer, repeated intravenous infusion of Aredia was shown to be safe and effective in reducing bone resorption and pain. In a randomized phase III trial of 377 patients with multiple myeloma, Aredia was administered in a dosage of 90 mg i.v. every 4 weeks. Compared with placebo, treatment with Aredia was associated with a significant decrease in bone pain and in the incidence and time to development of all skeleton-related events. Data from two phase III breast cancer trials each involving 300 patients are now being analyzed. The newer bisphosphonates can safely be used together with standard anticancer therapy to provide effective palliation of symptoms caused by lytic bone metastases."

CD008686,0,8815468,0,[Iatrogenic spinal epidermoid tumors. A late complication of spinal puncture].,"INTRODUCTION. Epidermoid tumors in the spinal canal are rare. Whether congenitally or iatrogenically caused, they form as the result of epidermal cells implanted within the spinal channel. Such implantation can occur during a variety of procedures and events such as bullet wounds, surgery, myelography or punctures for diagnosis, anesthesia or treatment. Although this complication is not discussed in books or journals on anesthesiology, we have found it mentioned in over 100 published cases reporting iatrogenically caused spinal epidermoid tumors. ETIOPATHOGENESIS. Iatrogenic epidermoid tumors of the spine derive from the implantation of epidermal tissue transported inside the spinal canal during lumbar punctures without guidance or with inadequate guidance. There is ample evidence that such tumors are iatrogenic. All cases occur in patients with a history of lumbar puncture. They are rarely associated with congenital anomalies. They are extramedullary. They tend to develop near sites of earlier lumbar puncture, usually near the conus medullaris and the cauda equina. Iatrogenic epidermoid tumors of the spine have been reproduced experimentally in two studies in which autologous skin fragments were implanted in the spinal canal. CLINICAL SIGNS. These tumors are well tolerated by patients for extended periods of time, ranging from 2 to 10 years. At the cauda equinus, tumors can grow slowly for long periods without signs of nerve compression. Symptoms are directly related to tumor size and site. All patients with tumors at the cauda equinus report severe pain radiating toward the roots of compressed nerves. Nuclear magnetic resonance makes it possible to detect the tumor without administration of intrathecal contrast. At present gadolinium-DTPA improves the image so that these tumors can be distinguished from other types. The prognosis for epidermoid tumors of the spine is good, as they are histologically benign. Treatment is always surgical. CONCLUSION. Although the causal relation between epidermoid spinal tumors and lumbar puncture is well documented, anesthesiologists are not sufficiently aware of this possible complication. Between 1977 and 1995, 28 new cases were published. We believe that a deeper understanding of such rare complications will show us how to prevent them while providing appropriate use of epidural and subarachnoid anesthesia."
CD008686,0,8780094,0,Schwannomatosis: a clinical and pathologic study.,"Schwannomas are benign nerve sheath tumors that most commonly occur singularly in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple schwannomas in a single patient are most often seen in neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), but several recent reports suggest that schwannomatosis may also be a distinct clinical entity. We studied the clinical, radiographic, and pathologic features of 14 patients with multiple schwannomas who did not have vestibular schwannoma diagnostic of NF2. Most patients had peripheral nerve tumors that presented with pain. Many also had spinal nerve root and cranial nerve tumors. Three had multiple tumors limited to a single limb. We found that these 14 individuals did not exhibit phenotypic overlap with the neurofibromatoses. Only 1 of 14 patients had a positive family history. We conclude that patients with multiple schwannomas, who do not have vestibular schwannoma, comprise a distinct clinical problem, but further molecular genetic analysis is needed to define the pathophysiology of this disorder."
CD008686,0,8726348,0,Management of back pain in athletes.,"Back pain affects millions of people. It affects 80% of the population and up to 52% at any given time. Back pain is not limited to sedentary individuals; it has significant effects on athletes as well. Depending upon the sport, incidence rates of back pain occur in athletes from 1.1% to as high as 30%. Athletes differ from the non-athletic population in that their incentives to return to activity are considerably different than non-athletes. The reasons may vary from the will to win through to significant financial considerations. Although reasons for recovery are different, the physiology and mechanics of repair of injured soft tissue in the athlete is the same as for the non-athlete. Proper management of the athlete requires ruling out emergent causes of back pain such as tumour, infection, acute fracture, progressive neurological deficit, visceral sources (e.g. pancreatitis, abdominal aortic aneurysm), and rheumatoid variants. Once a good history and physical is performed, a simple classification system can be utilised to manage the athlete presenting with back pain. This system can be expressed as: (a) regional back pain; (b) radicular leg pain; (c) radicular leg pain with progressive neurological deficit; and (d) cauda equina syndrome. Each of these categories needs to be managed in a specific manner and can provide the healthcare professional with simple, straightforward guidelines for handling the athlete with lower back pain. The key is to return the athlete to the field of play in a safe and timely manner."

Animal studies showed potentiation of analgesia induced by ketamine and morphine. We hypothesized that intrathecal ketamine would potentiate the effects of intrathecal morphine in the treatment of cancer pain.
CD008686,0,8613845,0,Posterior instrumentation of the unstable cervicothoracic spine.,"Fractures, tumors, and other causes of instability at the cervicothoracic junction pose diagnostic and treatment challenges. The authors report on 23 patients with instability of the cervicothoracic region, which was treated with posterior plate fixation and fusion between the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine. During operation AO reconstruction plates with 8- or 12-mm hole spacing were affixed to the spine using screws in the cervical lateral masses and the thoracic pedicles. Postoperative immobilization consisted of the patient's wearing a simple external brace for 2 months. The following parameters were analyzed during the pre- and postoperative treatment period: neurological status, spine anatomy and reconstruction, and complications. Follow up consisted of clinical and radiographic examinations (mean duration of follow up, 15.4 months; range, 6-41 months). No neurovascular or pulmonary complications arose from surgery. All patients achieved a solid arthrodesis based on flexion-extension radiographs. There was no significant change in angulation during the postoperative period, but one patient had an increase in translation that was not clinically significant. There were no hardware complications that required reoperation. One patient requested hardware removal in hopes of reducing postoperative pain in the cervicothoracic region. One postoperative wound infection required debridement but not hardware removal. The authors conclude that posterior plate fixation is a satisfactory method of treatment of cervicothoracic instability."
CD008686,0,8610645,0,Radiotherapy without steroids in selected metastatic spinal cord compression patients. A phase II trial.,"A phase II trial was planned to investigate the feasibility of radiotherapy (RT) without steroids in 20 consecutive patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC), no neurologic deficits, or only radiculopathy, and no massive invasion of the spine at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Aiming at an early diagnosis, MRI or CT was prescribed for all cancer patients with back pain and osteolysis, even when there were no signs of neurologic spinal compression. All patients were given 30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks with no steroids. Back pain and motor capacity were the parameters adopted to verify response to RT. Sixteen of 20 patients (80%) were able to walk without support, and 14 (70%) had no radiculopathy. Seventeen of 20 cases (85%) achieved relief from back pain. Regarding motor function, all patients (100%) responded to RT because the 16 patients able to walk without support at diagnosis did not deteriorate and the other 4, who needed support, became ambulatory without motor impairment. Median survival time was 14 months. Eight of 20 (40%) treated patients are still alive (14 to 36 months after end of RT), fully ambulatory, and free from relapse in the treated spine. Acute side effects were documented in only 2 patients (10%) and were managed without steroids. The results of this study suggest that RT without steroids is a feasible regimen for MSCC patients with good motor function. Elimination of steroids from the standard treatment for MSCC avoids cortisone side effects above all in those patients with diabetes, hypertension, peptic ulcer, and other steroid-sensitive medical problems."
CD008686,0,9102825,0,[Neuroleukemia in adults].,"Involvement of CNS with leukemic cells is well recognized complication of acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) in childhood, but with recent improvements in systemic treatment and longer survival the incidence of this complication has increased in adults. Neurological symptomatology in patients with CNS leukemia is due to meningeal infiltration, but sometimes also to diffuse and nodular cerebral infiltration. Between January 1991 and December 1994, 36 patients suffering of acute leukemia, 28 with ALL, and 8 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were demonstrated to have neuroleukemia by the following criteria: (1) the presence at lumbar puncture (LP) pleocytosis and blast cells on CSF sediment (without positive bacteriologic and fungal cultures), and (2) the presence of neurological symptoms and signs. All 36 patients had 46 episodes of CNS involvement. All patients had neurological examinations during every episode, and according to the neurological abnormalities were classified into four categories. LP was performed in all, and CSF sediments obtained by sedimentation in Sayk's chambers, were routinely stained by MGG and cytochemical stains to detection of leukemic cells (Fig. 1). EEG was done during 21 episodes, CT scan during 15. We divided patients into four groups according to the most prominent neurological symptoms and signs. First was the group included 23 episodes (50%), (18 ALL, 5 AML), where symptoms and signs of meningeal irritation predominated, mimicking the clinical picture of meningitis. This meningeal syndrome can sometimes produce differential diagnostic problems with CNS infections, when CSF examination is of primary importance. Second was the group of 9 patients (6 ALL and 3 AML) with 10 episodes (21.74%) where cranial nerve symptoms and signs-predominated, or were exclusively present. Most frequently affected were bulbomotors, facials and opticus. Third group consisted of 8 ALL patients (8 episodes, 17.39%) with dominant spinal root symptomatology, caused by pathological infiltration of either spinal roots or meninges surrounding them. This group includes also one patient with mononeuritis multiplex and the other with painful polyneuropathy. All patients in this group had pain on straight leg raising, but we stress here that all patients from other groups had positive Lazarevitsh's sign, too. So, it can be a good differential diagnostic parameter for distinguishing toxic medicamentous polyneuropathy from leukemic poliradiculoneuropathy. Fourth group included 5 patients (5 episodes, 10.87%). 4 ALL and 1 AML, where cerebral symptoms, such as seizures, hemiparesis and psychoorganic syndromes were prominent. CSF was obtained during all episodes by lumbar puncture. The protein concentration ranged from 21-3180 mg/dl, and was above normal (45 mg/dl) during 28 episodes. Mild hypoglycoracchia was present during 16 episodes. Cell count ranged from 11-4816 cells/cm3, malignant cells were identified during all episodes with same morphological and cytochemical characteristics of identified type of leukaemia. It has been established that the most valuable diagnostic procedure in CNS leukemia is CSF examination, and detection of blasts is sufficient for diagnosis. All other procedures like EEG, myelography and CT have only supplemental diagnostic significance. Finally, in this study we showed that neurological symptomatology in patients with acute leukemia is not dependent of the type of leukemia, moreover different types of AL can have same neurological manifestations. As others, we sometimes used the term CNS leukemia in this paper, although it is clear that meninges and peripheral nervous system are most often involved. This is the reason why we suggest that neuroleukemia, or NS leukemia should be used as more appropriate expressions."
CD008686,0,8633123,0,Ganglia and cysts around joints.,"Para-articular cysts frequently are seen on routine imaging examinations. They may be clinically asymptomatic or may cause pain, swelling, or impaired joint function. They often are associated with underlying joint disorders, such as trauma, degeneration, or inflammation. This article discusses the cause, symptoms, and appearance of para-articular cysts on various imaging examinations including arthrography, ultrasound, CT scan, and MR imaging. Specific attention is focused on those cystic masses appearing around the hip, knee, ankle and foot, shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand, spine, temporomandibular joints, and periosteum."
CD008686,0,8600878,0,Lumbosacral radiculopathy secondary to L5 metastatic melanoma of unknown primary.,"Lumbosacral radiculopathy secondary to spinal malignancy is rare. Spinal melanoma without cutaneous manifestations is even more unusual. We present the case of a 45-year-old physician with a history of degenerative disease of lumbar spine and chronic back pain who presented with increasing back pain with right radiculopathy despite conservative management for 6 months. Computed tomography showed a destructive lesion of the L5 vertebral body. Results from a biopsy guided by computed tomography suggested neoplasm of unknown origin. The patient underwent anterior vertebrectomy with instrumentation and fusion. Surgical pathology study results showed metastatic melanoma of unknown primary. The patient had no cutaneous manifestation of the disease. This is the first reported case of radiculopathy due to melanoma metastatic to the lumbar spine. In view of the atypical presentation of our patient's malignancy, we emphasize the importance of including malignancy of lumbar spine in the differential diagnosis of progressive lower back pain with radiculopathy."
CD008686,0,8595764,0,Malignant granular cell tumor mimicking herniated nucleus pulposus.,"Peripheral nerve tumors may arise in any nerve, large or small. Their presence is readily apparent when they are superficial, but when they are located in a deep nerve, symptoms can mimic+ the nerve root pain of herniated nucleus pulposus. This case of malignant granular cell tumor, probably of Schwann cell origin, involved the sciatic and tibial nerves in the popliteal fossa. Originally the pain was assumed to be produced by a herniated nucleus pulposus. The discovery of the mass thus +was delayed. The mass gave a heterogeneous signal on magnetic resonance imaging studies. A peripheral origin of nerve pain should be considered whenever pain radiates to a limb. A complete physical examination that includes palpation of the nerve to which pain is referred gives the best clue as to the true cause of pain when a peripheral nerve tumor is present."
CD008686,0,8594287,0,Diagnosis and management of lumbar disk disease.,"Acute low-back pain is one of the most common problems encountered by primary-care physicians. A few patients have severe neurologic impairment or evidence of cancer or other serious underlying systemic illness. For such patients, a broad differential diagnosis must be considered, and a prompt work-up and specialty consultation may be necessary. For most patients with acute low-back pain, extensive laboratory and imaging tests are unnecessary, and rapid improvement can be expected with only simple treatment measures. Physical therapy is useful in patients with refractory symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging and other sophisticated spinal imaging should usually be reserved for patients who are being considered for an operation. Surgical referral should be considered for the patient with a documented lumbar disk herniation that correlates precisely with clinical findings. Surgical treatment is usually elective in patients with persistent radicular pain and a mild to moderate neurologic deficit, urgent in patients with severe or progressive monoradiculopathy, and emergent in patients with the cauda equina syndrome. Lumbar diskectomy with magnified vision is the surgical procedure of choice, and success rates of 80 to 90% can be expected in properly selected patients."
CD008686,0,8559201,0,Efficacy of pamidronate in reducing skeletal events in patients with advanced multiple myeloma.

CD008686,0,8684019,0,[Vertebral hemangioma and quiescent myeloma: association of therapeutic significance].,"Smouldering myeloma is a monoclonal gammopathy in which the M component is higher than 30 g/l and the proportion of plasma cells in the bone marrow is higher than 10% with no anemia, renal failure, hypercalcemia, osteolysis or other features due to the monoclonal gammopathy. The recognition of this clinical variant of myeloma resides in the fact that treatment should be deferred until there are clinical or biologic data indicating evident disease progression. Vertebral hemangioma is a relatively frequent benign tumor in the general population which, although usually asymptomatic, may cause local or radicular bone pain. A patient who fulfilled the criteria of myeloma and who complained of localized bone pain in the spinal column is herein presented. Following a study of the dorsolumbar column by computerized tomography and magnetic resonance, bone lesions with radiologic images characteristic of vertebral hemangioma, clearly different from those observed in myelomatous lesions, were identified. This finding conditioned the treatment, which included radiotherapy for the vertebral hemangioma and no treatment for the smouldering myeloma."
CD008686,0,8962786,0,"[A 56-year-old man with fever, backache and tetraparesis].","We report a 56-year-old man who developed progressive paraparesis. He was apparently well, except for left Bell's palsy which developed on May 9 of 1994, for which he received stellate ganglion block on the left side more than ten times until July 2nd of 1994, when he noted pain in his left shoulder and in his lumbar region. On July 5th, he noted some difficulty in urination. On July 6th, he noted tingling sensation in his four extremities and difficulty in gait. He was admitted to another hospital where he was treated with intravenous infusion of glycerol. After this treatment, his gait and sensory disturbance showed some improvement, however, on July 7th, his shoulder and lumbar pain worsened, and he became unable to stand. His temperature went up to 39 degrees C on the next day. Lumbar CSF on that day contained 119 cells/microliters, 112 mg/dl of protein, and 53 mg/dl of sugar. He was transferred to our hospital on July 14th. His past medical history revealed that he had suffered from frequent bouts of osteomyelitis since the age of 13 years. He was operated on several times on osteomyelitis. He had been treated on his tooth ache until shortly before the onset of the present illness. He also received steroid hormone for his Bell's palsy. On admission, his consciousness varied from alert to stupor. His BP was 150/100 mmHg, HR 98/min and regular, BT 39.4 degrees C. The bulbar conjunctiva appeared somewhat icteric. Otherwise, general physical examination was unremarkable. On neurologic examination, there was no apparent dementia. Higher cerebral functions appeared intact. The optic discs were flat. Pupils were round and isocoric reacting to light and accommodation promptly. Ocular movements were full without nystagmus. Some exophthalmos was noted bilaterally. The sensation of the face and facial muscles were intact. The remaining cranial nerves also appeared intact. Nuchal rigidity was present. He was unable to stand or walk. Muscle strength was markedly diminished in all four limbs; manual muscle testing revealed 1 to 2/5 weakness in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Muscle stretch reflexes were decreased or lost in both upper and lower limbs, but the plantar response was extensor on the right. Sensation appeared to be diminished in legs, but detail was not clear because of disturbance of consciousness. Pertinent laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 12,800/microliter, GPT 58 IU/l, total bilirubin 2.65 mg/dl, and CRP 16.8 mg/dl. Cerebrospinal fluid contained 34 cells/microliter (approximately two thirds were neutrophils), RBC 1,110/microliter, 2,949 mg/dl of protein, and 119 mg/dl of glucose; stapylococcus aureus was cultured from the CSF. Myelogram showed a filling defect in the anterior epidural space between the low thoracic and the upper lumbar region. The patient was treated with cephotaxim, aminobenzyl penicillin, and chloramphenicol. On the second hospital day, his BT was still 39 degrees C and he was agitated His weakness was worse than the previous day. Spinal MRI was attempted; as he was agitated 5 mg of diazepam was given intravenously at 4 PM. His respiration was rapid and somewhat shallow. At 6 PM, gadolinium DTPA was injected intravenously; at that time, he was breathing and pupils were 3 mm on both sides. At 6:35 PM, an examiner noted that he stopped breathing; the left pupil was dilated to 5 mm. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated immediately, and intubation was performed. He was placed on a respirator. His blood pressure did not reach 100 mmHg; he was in deep coma. Cardiac arrest occurred at 8:53 AM on the next morning. The patient was discussed in a neurological CPC. Most of the participants thought that the patient had either spinal epidural empyema or spinal subdural abscess. The question was what might be the original focus of infection.

An audit of 2068 attendances in a large acute hospital.,"Computed tomography (CT) delivers a substantial proportion of the medical radiation dose to the population. The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) recommends that ""CT examinations should only be carried out after there has been proper clinical justification for the examination of each individual by an experienced radiologist"". The aim of this study was to review the indications for body CT in a large acute hospital in order to identify groups of patients in whom CT might not be ""clinically justified"". We reviewed the age, sex and diagnosis of all patients undergoing CT of the abdomen and pelvis (including lumbar spine) in our department in 1992. All requests had been checked by a senior radiologist before booking. CT was performed in 1078 male patients and in 990 females. Patients examined for benign disease were younger (mean age 52 years) than patients with malignant disease (mean age 57 years). Of 915 examinations performed for benign disease, 293 (32%) were orthopaedic in nature and included 255 (87%) for back pain. CT was carried out for benign non-orthopaedic disease in 97 women under 50 years old, usually following other tests with inconclusive or normal results. 49 of these examinations were reported as normal. Of 191 patients who had more than one CT examination, 158 (83%) were undergoing follow-up for malignant disease. All 39 patients who underwent CT on three or more occasions had life-threatening conditions, either malignancy or complicated acute pancreatitis. We have been unable to find substantial numbers of patients in whom CT was performed inappropriately. Substitution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for CT of the spine will help population dose reduction. The benign condition responsible for the largest radiation dose from CT is complicated acute pancreatitis, and it may be possible to substitute MRI for CT in these patients. Women under 50 years old with normal CT form an important group for clinical audit."

The tumour of the thyroid was found to be metastatic adenocarcinoma from her previous rectal cancer. Other synchronous metastases were noted in her lumbar spine and kidneys. The clinical finding of metastases to the thyroid gland is rare, particularly from a colorectal primary.

CD008686,0,8681032,0,[A case of rheumatoid arthritis associated with multiple myeloma].,"Previous reports have stressed the association between autoimmune disease and lympho-proliferative neoplasm. Here we report a patient in whom multiple myeloma developed about 30 years after the onset of rheumatoid arthritis. A 79 year-old woman with an about 30-year history of rheumatoid arthritis was admitted because of lumbago in December, 1993. Laboratory findings revealed M-proteinemia (IgA 2,380 mg/dl, IgG 728 mg/dl, IgM 51 mg/dl) and serum immunoelectrophoresis showed monoclonal IgA with lambda type light chain. Bone marrow aspirate contained 66.0% plasma cells. Serological tests of rheumatoid factor were positive. X-ray findings revealed radiolucent myelomatous foci in the skull and typical destructive changes of rheumatoid arthritis in multiple joint. From these findings, IgA lambda-type multiple myeloma with rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed. Although the pathogenesis of the association between rheumatoid arthritis and multiple myeloma is unknown, prolonged antigenic stimulation manifested by rheumatoid arthritis is considered to be a possible pathogenetic factor in the development of multiple myeloma."

Treatment was often palliative in the tumoral pathology. We observed 3 deaths (10.5%), 16 recoveries (58%), 6 cases of residual renal failure (21%), 3 cases of terminal chronic renal failure (10.5%) and 4 cases of recurrence. The lithiasic etiology of acute obstructive renal failure led to a high short-term mortality (15.5%), an effective etiologic causative treatment (69.5%) and a high rate or restoration of the renal function (69.5%). On the other hand, in the neoplastic etiology, there were no short-term mortality, but a frequent course to chronic renal failure."

The chief complaints on admission were lumbar pain and pain in the extremities (77.8%) and generalized weakness (61.1%). The most common laboratory findings were severe anemia (hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dl) (50%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (75%), monoclonal spike in the serum protein electrophoresis (44.4%), and lytic skull lesions (72.2%). Twenty-three (64%) patients had a monoclonal IgG, 9 (25%) had IgA, 1 had IgD, 2 had light chain disease, and 1 was nonsecretory. Localized plasmacytoma was detected in 4 patients and 4 patients had amyloidosis in rectal and gingival biopsies.

CD008686,0,9050200,0,F-wave recordings from nasal muscle for intraoperative monitoring of facial nerve function.,"The generation of the F-wave in muscle after peripheral motor nerve stimulation depends upon the functional integrity of the entire motoaxon between its axon hillock and the motor endplates. Cerebellopontine angle (CPA) surgery bears the risk of damaging the facial nerve in its root exit zone; functional degradation should therefore be reflected by changes of the nasal muscle F-wave. Constant current pulses supraliminal for direct (M) muscular responses were applied subcutaneously to the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve ipsilateral to the operated side, EEG needle electrodes were placed in the nasal muscle and referred to glabella for recording of myoelectric activity. Anesthesia was achieved by application of fentanyl, midazolame and N2O and low doses of short acting muscular relaxants; the above-mentioned narcotics did not influence F-wave recordings, whereas the administration of muscle relax ants was often deleterious to F-wave monitoring. 22 patients with different tumors in the CPA, the cerebellum or the vicinity of the brainstem were subject to this monitoring procedure up to now. F-wave monitoring was effective in 12/22 cases. In 7/12 patients the signal was stable without any resulting dysfunction postoperatively. In 3/12 cases changes in amplitude and/or latency were observed indicating a subsequent facial palsy of a moderate degree. In 2 cases the F-wave was lost-these suffered from a facial paralysis afterwards. As an illustrative case the course of one of these is pointed out. In 10/22 procedures F-wave monitoring was ineffective due to the prolonged administration of muscle relaxants. The F-wave appears to be a valid tool for intraoperative prognosis of postoperative facial nerve function in CPA surgery. The borderlines of F-wave changes indicating damage to neural function by surgical manipulation are to be defined next."

Patients' age ranged from 1 to 14 years (mean 8.4 years). The male:female ration was 2:3. Two patients had Ewing's sarcoma (ES) originating from L5-S1 and L4-5 pedicles, respectively; two patients had mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (MCS) originating from L1-2 pedicles and L5 body, respectively; and one patient had osteogenic sarcoma (OS) of C4 body. All patients clinically presented with pain and progressive weakness of the extremities. The time that elapsed between the onset of symptoms and diagnoses ranged from one to five months. All cases were treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and subtotal tumour resection with spinal canal decompression. Two cases received posterior spinal fusion operations. Three patients were alive 10 to 98 months following diagnosis. Only the case with ES of L5-S1 pedicles was in complete remission and off therapy at the 98th postoperative month. The two MCS cases were in partial remission, and were receiving chemotherapy at the time of analysis. These tumours caused similar clinical findings and prognoses, and required combined treatment, which consisted of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy; histologically three different types of malignant tumours are presented in the same category. We preferred surgical decompression and stabilization procedures especially for neurologically symptomatic patients, even if they had extensive tumours with high grades. By spinal canal decompression and stabilisation, we did not intend to cure the disease; however, we intended to provide neurological improvement, spinal stabilisation, improved quality of life, early mobilisation of the patient, and cytoreduction by means of surgical tumour ablation, which could render the chemotherapy more effective."

The tumor was extramedullary in 18 patients and intramedullary In 25. MEPs were abnormal in 62.8% of patients. There were no significant differences in the rate of MEP abnormalities according to the lesion site or the histological findings, except for meningiomas which showed abnormal MEPs in all eight patients included in this series. The percentage of patients with abnormal MEPs was 9.3% despite the absence of any clinical symptom of central motor pathway dysfunction. Infraclinical MEPs abnormalities were observed in 24% of explored limbs. Median and tibial nerves somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded in 41 patients and showed abnormalities of central conduction or of segmental spinal responses in 65.9% of the cases. When combining data from MEP and SEPs, abnormalities were observed in 70.7% of patients (29/41). Five patients (12.2%) had abnormal MEPs, but normal SEPs, and four other patients (9.8%) had abnormal SEPs, but normal MEPs. This finding suggests that both MEPs and SEPs should be recorded for presurgical evaluation of-intraspinal tumor."
CD008686,0,8938925,0,LINAC-based spinal stereotactic radiosurgery.,"The authors' report on the use of a prototype spinal stereotactic radiosurgery frame which was employed for the treatment of 9 patients who presented with recurrent neoplastic involvement of the spinal column. All patients had failed standard therapy consisting of surgery, external fractionated radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Eight of the lesions represented metastatic tumors in the vertebral column, one of the lesions was a primary osteosarcoma involving multiple vertebral bodies. The lesions were found at multiple levels, from the cervical through the sacral region. Six out of the 9 patients presented with epidural compression: 4 of the 9 patients with evidence of myelopathy: 2 of the 9 patients with radicular symptoms secondary to compression from the tumor, and 1 patient was free of any compressive symptoms. All patients had pain requiring narcotics. Patients were treated with a median radiosurgical dose of 800 cGy (range 800-1.000) with a median of 1 isocenter (range 1-7 isocenters) and median normalization of 80% to the isodose contour (range 80-160). Median dose delivered to the already prior irradiated spinal cord was 179 cGy (range 52-320 cGy) with a median spinal cord dose of 34 (range 4-68). To date, there have been three minor complications: one radiation-induced esophagitis which was treated medically: one wound infection, and 1 patient requiring an additional 24 h of hospitalization stay. There have been no major complications. To date, 5 of the 9 patients have died, all from causes unrelated to the spinal radiosurgery. Three out of the 9 patients have been followed for more than 1 year. In all 3, there was radiographic regression of the tumor and epidural compression. In 2 patients, there was histologic confirmation of absence of tumor in the treated site: in 1 patient. no tumor was found at postmortem. 12 months after treatment, when the patient died of unrelated causes. Although the number of patients followed is limited, the phase I study clearly shows the technical feasibility of spinal radiosurgery for the control of metastatic involvement of the vertebral column even in the face of epidural compression."
CD008686,0,8934120,0,Radiological diagnosis of skeletal metastases.,"The clinical management of patients with skeletal metastases puts new demands on imaging. The radiological imaging in screening for skeletal metastases entails detection, metastatic site description and radiologically guided biopsy for morphological typing and diagnosis. Regarding sensitivity and the ease in performing surveys of the whole skeleton, radionuclide bone scintigraphy still is the first choice in routine follow-up of asymptomatic patients with metastatic disease of the skeleton. A negative scan has to be re-evaluated with other findings, with emphasis on the possibility of a false-negative result. Screening for metastases in patients with local symptoms or pain is best accomplished by a combination of radiography and MRI. Water-weighted sequences are superior in sensitivity and in detection of metastases. Standard spin-echo sequences on the other hand are superior in metastatic site description and in detection of intraspinal metastases. MRI is helpful in differentiating between malignant disease, infection, benign vertebral collapse, insufficiency fracture after radiation therapy, degenerative vertebral disease and benign skeletal lesions. About 30% of patients with known cancer have benign causes of radiographic abnormalities. Most of these are related to degenerative diseases and are often easily diagnosed. However, due to overlap in MRI characteristics, bone biopsy sometimes is essential for differentiating between malignant and nonmalignant lesions. Performing bone biopsy and aspiration cytology by radiologist and cytologist in co-operation has proven highly accurate in diagnosing bone lesions. The procedure involves low risk to the patient and provides a morphological diagnosis. Once a suspected metastatic lesion is detected, irrespective of modality, the morphological diagnosis determines the appropriate work-up imaging with respect to the therapy alternatives. The integration of multimodality imaging in the assessment of skeletal metastases is complex and requires multidiciplinary co-operation in order to optimize screening and medical clinical care with respect to the prognosis and life quality of patients with bone metastatic disease."
CD008686,0,8904463,0,Promoting parental use of nonpharmacologic techniques with children during lumbar punctures.,"A pretest and posttest with control group design was used to examine the effect of teaching eight children with acute leukocytic leukemia, aged 6 to 14 years, and their parents about selected nonpharmacologic techniques, then to support their use of these techniques during children's lumbar punctures. Children's distress behaviors were observed and recorded during the procedures. A Visual Analogue Scale was used to obtain children's self-report and parents' and staff nurses' perceptions of children's pain during the procedure. Posttest comparison of four subjects in the treatment group with four subjects in the control group indicated that the treatment group had fewer expressions of verbal resistance (P = .04), less muscular rigidity (P = .04), and more parent interventions (P = .06). Preintervention with postintervention comparison of all eight subjects indicated that following intervention, children had lower levels of self-reported pain (P = .09), fewer requests for emotional support (P = .07), fewer expressions of verbal fear (P = .10), and fewer information-seeking questions (P = .10). Comments from children and parents indicate that children benefitted from nonpharmacologic techniques."
CD008686,0,8884708,0,Nonoperative treatment of degenerative cervical disk disease.,"The therapeutic goal in treating patients with degenerative neck pain is prompt return to normal activity with the least diagnostic and therapeutic expense. Although many noninvasive treatment modalities exist, most are based on empiricism and tradition and lack scientific validation. With few exceptions, degenerative cervical pain syndromes require an initial period of conservative therapy, since their natural course favors spontaneous resolution. Patients with a clinical history suggestive of either progressive myelopathy, infection, or malignancy warrant more aggressive initial assessment and treatment."
CD008686,0,8826019,0,The effect of the neurolytic agent ethanol on cytoplasmic calcium in arterial smooth muscle and endothelium.,"Celiac plexus neurolysis, although effective in relieving pain associated with upper abdominal malignancy, occasionally results in paraplegia. Diffusion of the neurolytic agent to arteries supplying the spinal cord has been postulated as a cause, and previous studies with isolated lumbar segmental arteries have demonstrated contraction in response to ethanol and phenol. The mechanism of this contractile effect is unknown, but a role for insular free calcium (Ca2+i) is suggested by the known involvement of Ca2+i in both smooth muscle vasoconstriction and toxic cell injury. The authors sought to determine whether nontoxic concentrations of ethanol cause a direct elevation of Ca2+i in arterial smooth muscle and endothelium."
CD008686,0,8819713,0,[Clinical significance of whole body thallium-201 chloride scintigraphy in multiple myeloma].,"This study attempts to characterize the findings of thallium-201 chloride (201TlCl) uptake in patients with multiple myeloma and to evaluate its clinical significance. Twenty-four patients (including 10 untreated cases, 5 relapsed cases and 9 cases in stable course after initial treatment) were evaluated. Whole body 201Tl scintigraphy was performed 10 minutes after intravenous administration of 111 MBq of 201TlCl. Abnormal scintigraphic findings in whole body scanning varied from solitary focal uptake to extensive diffuse bone marrow visualization, but fell into the following 3 broad types; 1) skeletal visualization type, 2) predominant focal uptake type and 3) mixed type. Diffuse bone marrow uptake could be classified according to the skeletal distribution into 5 gradings (grade 0-4) between normal and entire skeletal visualization. This grading was roughly related to estimated tumor mass classification by tumor mass staging system (Alexanian, 1985). Furthermore, serum beta2-microglobulin level, that is widely confirmed as the reliable parameter of tumor burden and response to treatment except for patients with renal dysfunction, showed significant difference between grade 2 and grade 3 (p < 0.05), grade 2 and grade 4 (p < 0.01). The detectability of focal myelomatous lesions was compared to those of plain radiographs and 99mTc-HMDP scintigraphy in the untreated cases. Whole body 201Tl scintigraphy demonstrated 32 lesions among 46 focal lesions which included lesions revealed on either X-ray CT or MR imaging. In contrast to whole body 201Tl scintigraphy, plain radiographs and 99mTc-HMDP scintigraphy demonstrated 23 lesions and 22 lesions, respectively. All focal lesions exceeding 5 cm3 in tumor size were detectable on whole body 201Tl scintigraphy. Whole body 201Tl scintigraphy additionally showed 12 focal lesions that were demonstrated on MR imagings but failed to be detected on plain radiographs. However, detection of small lesions confined within the vertebral body was difficult. In conclusion, whole body 201Tl scintigraphy is a useful non-invasive tool to investigate the patients with multiple myeloma."
CD008686,0,8800325,0,Spinal chordomas--results of treatment over a 17-year period.,"Among a series of 511 spinal tumours treated in the Department of Neurosurgery at the Nordstadt Hospital in Hannover, Germany, between September 1977 and August 1994, 23 operations for spinal chordomas in 9 patients (3 females, 6 males) were performed. After an average period of 7 +/- 12 months (2 weeks to 5 years) patients presented at an average age of 45 +/- 17 years with pain (68%), gait ataxia (14%), motor weakness (9%) or sphincter disturbances (9%). A complete resection was achieved in 11 operations and a subtotal tumour removal in 12 instances. After subtotal removal, 5 tumours were treated postoperatively using local high dose radiotherapy (60-70 Gy). Overall, every chordoma recurred with the passage of time unless en-bloc resection of the tumour had been performed. The recurrence-free interval tended to be longer after radiotherapy. Analysis of postoperative results revealed a significant positive effect of radiotherapy for motor function, pain, Karnofsky score, and survival. In conclusion, en-bloc resection should be performed whenever localization and extension of the tumour allow one to do so. Surgery should be followed by local high dose radiotherapy."

He was febrile (temperature, 38.3 degrees C [101 degrees F]) and had a leukocyte count of 27.8 x 10(9) per liter (27,800 per mm3). On physical examination, he had a 2-cm open wound with minimal purulent drainage on the fourth digit of his right hand. He had some limited range of motion of the right hip and focal muscular tenderness in the medial thigh, but no other infectious or neurologic findings. A radiographic evaluation included chest, lumbar, right femur, and pelvic films and a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen; all were normal. In addition, a nuclear medicine scan showed no signs of infection. A CT scan and a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the pelvis were done (Figures 1 and 2)."
CD008686,0,8747973,0,Intrathecal octreotide for relief of intractable nonmalignant pain: 5-year experience with two cases.,"Somatostatin is distributed in the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and its application has been found to produce an inhibitory effect on nociceptive neurons. Although intraspinal administration of somatostatin-14 produces pain relief in patients with cancer and in postoperative patients, its short half-life limits its clinical usefulness. Octreotide, a synthetic analog of somatostatin, is more stable and not been associated with neurodegenerative changes when administered intrathecally in dogs. Intrathecal octreotide provides analgesia without adverse drug effects when administered chronically for cancer pain; however, treatment periods have been limited. This article describes the 5-year clinical course of two patients receiving intrathecal octreotide for severe, intractable nonmalignant pain. Included in this description are the results of blinded, randomized ""N of 1"" trials conducted in each of these patients."
CD008686,0,8738385,0,"Results of DREZ coagulations for pain related to plexus lesions, spinal cord injuries and postherpetic neuralgia.","The results of 58 dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) thermocoagulation procedures in 51 patients are reported. The postoperative analgesic effect was judged by the patients as being good (more than 75% pain reduction), fair (25-75% pain reduction) or poor (less than 25% pain reduction). Of the 14 patients who underwent surgery for pain due to cervical root avulsion, 10 (77%) had permanently good (8) or fair (2) pain relief after a mean follow up period of 76 months, another 2 (15%) experienced recurrence to the preoperative level (initially 1 good, 1 fair) after more than 2 and 4 years, respectively. Twenty two paraplegics were operated upon, 3 of whom twice, for intractable pain. After a mean observation time of 54 months, continuing pain relief was reported by 12 (55%) patients (11 good, 1 fair), and one (initially fair) had recurrent pain after 8 months. All 3 (early) re-operations remain successful for an average period of 75 months. Poor results were seen especially in cases of associated spinal cord cysts (5 out of 7), despite combined drainage, and in patients with diffuse pain distribution (5 out of 6). Continuous marked improvement for longer periods (mean follow up: 52 months) after DREZ lesions was reported only by 2 out of 10 patients with postherpetic neuralgia (12 procedures) and by 1 out of 5 with painful states due to radiation-induced brachial plexopathy (2), previous surgery (2) and malignant tumour infiltration of the brachial plexus (1). Three patients died postoperatively due to acute cardiac failure (2) and pulmonary embolism (1). Major complications, especially permanent gait disturbances were observed in 6 patients (12%) following primary procedures and in 2 out of 7 patients after re-operations, most of them suffering from postherpetic neuralgia. Minor neurological deficits were noted in 9 cases (18%). DREZ lesions revealed to be an effective procedure in patients with pain related to root avulsion and paraplegia. In contrast, it seems to be less successful for painful states due to other plexus lesions or postherpetic neuralgia."
CD008686,0,8724195,0,Vertebral hemangioma presenting with intermittent claudication.,"The case of a patient with vertebral hemangioma and unusual clinical presentation is reported, with an attempt to explain these unusual clinical complaints. Vertebral hemangioma is a common and often asymptomatic tumor. Neurologic symptoms may appear due to pressure on the neural tissue caused by extraosseous extension. The patient reported here presented with intermittent claudication. Conventional radiography CT, and MRI revealed vertebral hemangioma at T5 and extraosseous extension compressing the spinal cord. Gravity-related vascular dilatation may induce further compression of the spinal cord and, thus, is thought to be the underlying event in the induction of the intermittent clinical symptoms. The lesion was treated with subtotal corpectomy after embolization and fusion with a strut iliac crest graft. At the 9-month follow-up, the patient was without complaints. We conclude that a diagnosis of vertebral hemangioma should be considered in cases of intermittent neurologic symptoms of the lower extremities."
CD008686,0,8720005,0,Pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer.,"Recurrent rectal carcinoma presents a formidable problem for patient and surgeon. Isolated recurrences of rectal carcinoma have been reported from 7% to 33% with a median of 14%. Increasing recurrence is associated with increasing Dukes's stage. The reason for high recurrences is probably related to the limited anatomic margins that can be obtained in the pelvis during primary resections. Patients who have recurrence after a low-anterior resection are more likely to present with nonfixed, surgically correctable lesions versus recurrences after abdominoperineal resection. The most common symptom related to pelvic recurrence is pain, which may be perineal or radiate to the lower extremities. The 5-year survival rate among unresected patients with locoregional recurrences is 4%. These patients are often in extreme pain with lower extremity swelling and perineal lesions. Although many patients will be palliated by radiation, few will experience long-term relief (6 to 8 months). A thorough physical examination should include rectal and pelvic exams to evaluate tumor extension and fixation. Computed tomographic studies are helpful when taken serially to evaluate pelvic recurrence or liver metastases. Fineneedle biopsies may also be done under CT guidance. Additional mandatory films include plain chest roentgenograph, lumbosacral spine films, and bone scan to rule out sacral involvement, which would preclude sacral resection. Magnetic resonance imaging has recently been shown to be effective in evaluating pelvic side wall involvement and metastatic lymphadenopathy. Although extensive involvement would preclude aggressive resection, in one series, 50% of patients were amenable to resection. Pelvic exenteration should include the tumor mass, along with any involved organs and their lymphatic drainage, with a 2 cm margin. Complications are increased in patients who have undergone radiation, who have undergone procedures that include urinary diversions, and who have recurrent disease. Cure rates of 30% to 50% have been reported using pelvic exenteration for rectal cancer. Recurrent disease presents a significant problem in that normal anatomic planes have been disrupted. In one series, rectal recurrences treated with pelvic exenteration had a 66% recurrence rate. In addition, there is often a posterior component to the recurrence. Although the complication rate is high, the only chance for cure in these patients would be an abdominosacral resection. There appears to be a select group of patients with recurrent locoregional disease, who benefit from sacral resection with a 20% to 30%, 5-year survival rate."
CD008686,0,8712757,0,Tumours of the adrenal cortex.,"The authors report their experience of 34 benign and 17 malignant tumours of the adrenal cortex. Both occurred more frequently in women (79.4% of cortical adenomas and 70.6% of adrenocortical carcinomas). Moreover, females were significantly younger (average age: adenomas: females 44.9 years and males 54.4 years, adrenocortical carcinomas: females 34.1 years and males 58.3 years). Some tumours presented in the form of increased hormone production, while others were hormonally inactive and did not cause clinical signs until later. Pain was the first symptom in the cases of malignant adrenocortical tumours. Adenomas occurred as frequently twice in the left adrenal gland (24 versus 12), whereas carcinomas were more than twice are frequent on the right (10 versus 7). Ultrasonography and CT were appropriate and fully sufficient methods for the diagnosis of adrenal tumours. Arteriography was valuable in the differential diagnosis of large upper abdominal masses when the organ of origin could not be identified by CT and for determination of anatomic conditions and subsequent surgical tactics. For small tumours of the adrenal cortex, the classic lumbar approach through the bed of the resected eleventh rib is adequate. For larger tumours, extended lumbotomy, laparotomy or thoracotomy is necessary."
CD008686,0,8711611,0,Thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy for the relief of intractable abdominal pain.,"Video-thoracoscopic transthoracic splanchnicectomy has been applied to patients in the end stage of pancreas cancer who had intractable pain mediated through the splanchnic nerve in the left upper quadrant. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia in a right hemilateral position. Following the establishment of access to the thoracic cavity, the left splanchnic nerve is cut off at the level immediately above the aortic hiatus, through a small opening made in the pleura between the descending aorta and the vertebrae. All patients had immediate and complete relief of pain postoperatively. Only a transient drop in the mean arterial pressure was observed immediately after cutting off the nerve. No other detrimental effect of the procedure on the general condition was observed. No patients developed postoperative complications. The present method may, thus, be a treatment of choice directed toward the relief of intractable abdominal pain in selected patients with pancreatic cancer."
CD008686,0,8689415,0,Outcome after limited posterior surgery for thoracic and lumbar spine metastases.,"The efficacy of 'limited posterior surgery' for metastases in the thoracic and lumbar spine was studied prospectively in 51 patients (32 men and 19 women, mean age 64 years). The most common primary tumors were prostate, breast, and renal carcinoma, 37 patients had metastases in the thoracic spine and 14 in the lumbar spine. Indications for surgery were severe pain or neurologic deficit. Of the 46 patients with neurologic symptoms, 25 were unable to walk. Surgery was confined to direct or indirect decompression and stabilization with a pedicle screw fixator over few segments as possible. Pain, as well as a variety of functional performance parameters and residential status were registered preoperatively and after surgery at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and at 6-monthly intervals thereafter. Pain was rated by the patient on a Visual Analog Scale, and functional performance was assessed with the Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Scale. We had no perioperative neurologic deterioration or death. Nineteen of the 25 nonambulatory patients regained their walking ability. Postoperative pain relief was significant and lasting over time. Nearly half of the patients attained improvement in functional performance. The median survival was 8 months. Older age and intact postoperative walking ability were positive factors for survival."
CD008686,0,8677660,0,[Intraventricular morphine administration as a treatment possibility for patients with intractable pain].,"The treatment of intractable pain, especially in cancer patients, often sets problems to patient and therapist. While epidural and intrathecal spinal administration of opiates is a routine treatment in pain with a sub-diaphragmatic topography it is almost ineffective in cervicocephalic or thoracic cancer. An alternative here is the administration of morphine into the lateral or third ventricle by a catheter-reservoir system. We report on our experience in the treatment of twenty patients, mostly suffering from cancer (18 cases), from 1990 to 1993. It is shown to be an effective, non-destructive method with minimal side effects in the treatment of nociceptive pain. Analgesia takes effect within a few minutes and the necessary doses are low. Our results agree with those of other authors describing good to excellent results in 95% of patients with somatogenic pain. However, no or only minimal effect is achieved in the treatment of neurogenic pain by intracerebroventricular morphine therapy."
CD008686,0,8655942,0,Percivall Pott: tuberculous spondylitis.,"Tuberculous spondylitis, also known as Pott's disease, is an entity that produces a characteristic kyphotic deformity, and was described by Sir Percivall Pott in 1779 and 1782. The majority of his patients were infants and young children. Although the incidence of tuberculosis in the industrialized world has since declined dramatically, the number of cases of extrapulmonary disease, though small, has remained relatively unchanged. In developing countries, spondylitis is still generally a disease of children, but in Europe and North America, it more commonly involves older adults. Pott's spondylitis represents a reactivation of latent disease, frequently years after the initial infection. Clinical findings include complaints of back pain and symptoms of fever, chills, weight loss, malaise, and fatigue. Characteristically a late finding, paraplegia is occasionally the initial indicator of spinal involvement. There is an average delay of a year between the onset of symptoms and patient presentation. Plain spinal radiographs usually are the initial diagnostic modality utilized. Computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to further define the process. The differential diagnosis includes neoplasm, pyogenic or disseminated fungal infection, and sarcoid arthritis."

CD008686,0,8559372,0,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the central nervous system: a clinical and pathological study.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most common human leukemia but infrequently causes neurologic symptoms. We have reviewed all previously reported cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the CNS along with three new cases; one patient was diagnosed antemortem and treated with immediate improvement and 4-year survival. In addition, we reviewed all autopsy cases since 1972 and available lumbar puncture data on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital. Invasion of the CNS by chronic lymphocytic leukemia often leads to confusional state, meningitis with cranial nerve abnormalities, optic neuropathy, or cerebellar dysfunction. Lumbar puncture shows a lymphocytosis consisting of monoclonal B cells, but CSF cytology studies are of limited value in establishing the diagnosis. Long-term survival may be related to the stage of chronic lymphocytic leukemia at the time of CNS disease and may be associated with intrathecal chemotherapy. A mild, asymptomatic infiltration of the brain, frequently noted in late-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia in autopsy series, may explain the CSF lymphocytosis in some patients with late-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia."

A total of 1,243 cases of syringomyelia were ascertained. Among them, 622 were men and 619 women, and the average age of onset was 28 years old. The classification by Barnett et al was used, presenting syringomyelia with Chiari malformation in 684 cases (51.2%), dysraphism in 47 (3.7%), post traumatic syringomyelia in 139 (11%), post-spinal arachnoiditis in 76 (6%), spinal cord tumor in 132 (10.5%) and others in 204. Its predominant clinical course was slowly progressive, but 202 cases (17.9%) showed rather stable course including spontaneous resolution in 29 cases. The main initial symptoms were numbness in 522 cases (42%), motor disturbance in 504 (40.5%), and pain in 296 (23.8%). Neurologic signs noted in the abnormality of deep tendon reflexes in 836 cases (67.3%), motor disturbance in 763 (60.4%) and positive pathological reflexes in 383 (30.1%). Sensory disturbance was found in 942 cases (75.8%) and the dissociated type were 559 out of them (59.3%). It is noteworthy that 982 out of 1,243 were documented by MRI and surgical operations such as foramen magnum decompression, syringo-subarachnoid shunt and others were performed in 829 cases. Syringobulbia was confirmed on MRI in 101 cases of syringomyelia in which spinal cord tumors were most frequently associated."
CD008686,0,8587224,0,"Long-term gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy: the evolving issue of steroidal ""add-back"" paradigms.","The introduction of steroid ""add-back"" regimen draws on the recognition that several clinical entities targeted for treatment with GnRHa are not ""six-month diseases"". Included under this heading are individuals suffering from symptomatic endometriosis (not desirous of pregnancy), uterine fibroids (ineligible or disinterested in definitive surgical therapy), ovarian hyperandrogenism, premenstrual syndrome, menopausal transition, or dysfunctional uterine bleeding. A six month course of therapy with a GnRHa does not adversely affect lipoprotein economy and therefore presumably the corresponding cardiovascular risk. A six month course of GnRHa therapy appears to be associated with a substantial decrease (of up to 8.2%) in lumbar bone density, a phenomenon which may not be entirely reversible six months after discontinuation of therapy. In principle, steroid ""add-back"" therapy should diminish some or all of the side effects associated with GnRHa therapy, may provide a medical treatment option for patients representing a high surgical risk, and may delay surgical intervention if desired. On the other hand, a steroid ""add-back"" therapy may delay tissue diagnosis, be associated with a substantial cost as well as with the need in parenteral route of administration. Norethindrone-only (but not medroxyprogesterone acetate-only) ""add-back"" regimens have proved promising in the context of endometriosis. Non-concurrent estrogen/progestin ""add-back"" regimens proved promising in the context of uterine fibroids. Substantial additional studies would have to be carried out to validate the utility of steroid ""add-back"" regimens. Special emphasis will have to be placed on the evaluation of long-term utility with an eye towards assessing clinical efficacy, impact on lipoprotein economy, impact on bone density, impact on urogenital tissues, and impact on the hot flash. The concurrent or non-concurrent use of non-steroid ""add-back"" regimen will also most likely constitute a major component of future studies."

The differential indication for dorsal, ventral and combined surgical procedures depends on the nature and extent of the tumor, and the life expectancy and general state of health of the patient. Surgery must be carried out in good time, before additional damage to the spinal cord occurs. In recent years, 20 patients have been treated by GHG-vertebral body replacement. In 19 of these patients, pain was considerably improved. All patients were able to walk following surgery.

In contrast to autopsy findings, main symptoms were similar to subacute meningitis, and any signs of myelopathy could not be detected during the clinical course. The patient was a 22-year-old man who was hospitalized because of a 2-week history of progressive headache following cough and slight fever. Vomiting and somnolence, developing 5 days before admission, were improved the day after a lumbar puncture performed at another hospital. On admission, meningeal signs, mild right abducens palsy, and depressed deep tendon reflexes were detected. There was no muscle weakness, sensory loss, or Babinski sign. Lumbar puncture yielded CSF with an opening pressure of 280 mmH2O, 21 mononuclear cells/mm3, a protein level of 645 mg/dl, and a glucose level of 7 mg/dl. Cytology for malignancy and multiple cultures were negative. Brain CT scan showed mild hydrocephalus and swelling of the brainstem and cerebellum. Intravenous administration of antimicrobial drugs was started and ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery was performed. During the third hospital week, however, meningeal signs progressed and somnolence reappeared, followed by progressive multiple cranial neuropathy and polyradiculopathy characterized by flaccid tetraparesis, muscle atrophy, and sensory impairment without a level. Babinski sign could not be detected. MRI revealed an intramedullary lesion in the lower cervical cord, swelling of the brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord and nerve roots, and a diffuse or nodular thickning of leptomeninges. Repeated CSF cytology disclosed atypical cells. Examinations for extraneural malignancies were negative. During the 9th hospital week, flaccid tetraplegia progressed and stupor developed, and the patient died 2 weeks later. The pathological study was limited to the brain. The brain showed a diffuse opalescent thickening of the leptomeninges, especially over the ventral aspect of the brainstem and cerebellum, where the blood vesseles and cranial nerves were obscured. Histological examination revealed the appearance of GBM. The malignant cells filled the subarachnoid space, and to a variable extent penetrated the brainstem and cerebellum along perivascular spaces. Hypertrophied optic tracts and trigeminal nerves were also infiltrated by the cells. However, there were no mass lesions assumed to be primary ones anywhere in the cerebral parenchyma. Therefore, it was thought that GBM primarily growing in cervical cord metastasized to intracranial subarachnoid space by way of the cerebrospinal fluid pathway. Spinal cord GBM usually presents signs of myelopathy from the early stage. The present case was characterized by no signs of myelopathy during the clinical course. It is speculated that the intramedullary GBM, originating near the surface of cervical cord, had been rapidly disseminated into the subarachnoid space up to the intracranial cavity before myelopathy appeared, and caused cranial and spinal nerve roots dysfunction, which covered signs of myelopathy. Cord GBM should be always considered as a differential diagnesis in a case of subacute meningitis."
CD008686,0,8635068,0,A phase II study of subcutaneous recombinant human interleukin-4 in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.,A study was conducted to assess the response rate for and toxicity of recombinant human interleukin-4 (IL-4) administered subcutaneously to outpatients with metastatic renal cell cancer.
CD008686,0,8550357,0,Facial pain as a symptom of nonmetastatic lung cancer.,"Patients with nonmetastatic lung cancer may rarely experience facial pain as a presenting symptom, during the course of the disease or upon recurrence of the disease. This study reviews a 10-year experience at Mayo Clinic. The aim of this study was to (1) further characterize the clinical features of facial pain as a symptom of nonmetastatic lung cancer, and (2) assist clinicians in recognizing this association. Ten cases were identified. All patients complained of severe, aching, facial pain typically aural-temporal in location, ipsilateral to the lung cancer. Six of the 10 cases involved the left side. Recent weight loss was present in 7 of 10 patients, with an elevated sedimentation rate in 6. Digital clubbing was documented in three. Neurologic examinations and neuroimaging were normal in all patients. Lumbar puncture, when performed, was normal. Facial pain preceded the diagnosis of lung cancer by 1 to 24 months. In three patients, facial pain was the initial symptom of tumor recurrence. Four of the 10 tumors were adenocarcinoma; radiation with or without chemotherapy appears to be the treatment of choice for the facial pain. The presumed mechanism is local invasion of the vagus nerve. In suspected cases, a chest x-ray and chest CT are indicated."
CD008686,0,7487447,0,Lumbar-sacral radiculopathy secondary to intraspinal synovial cyst.,The presentation of a patient with acute low back pain and distal radiation to the lower extremities is often attributed to a herniated nucleus pulposus (NHP). The purpose of this report is to illustrate how an intraspinal lumbar synovial cyst can have a similar presentation.
CD008686,0,7472543,0,Surgical outcome for intra- and extrapelvic femoral nerve lesions.,"Seventy-eight traumatic neuropathies were seen in 94 patients with femoral nerve lesions; 54 of these were operated on because of persistent complete functional loss and/or pain. The most common mechanism of injury to the femoral nerve was iatrogenic due to inguinal herniorrhaphy, total hip replacement, intraabdominal vascular or gynecological operation, and, less commonly, appendectomy, lumbar sympathectomy, and laparoscopic procedures. Femoral nerve injuries also resulted from penetrating gunshot and stab wounds, laceration by glass, and stretch/contusive injuries associated with pelvic fractures. There were no signs of clinical or electrical recovery in 45 of 78 patients with traumatic nerve injuries. These and other partial injuries associated with pain were explored and evaluated by intraoperative nerve stimulation and recording of nerve action potentials (NAPs). Despite complete loss of nerve function preoperatively, 13 patients had recordable NAPs and underwent neurolysis; each recovered function to at least a Grade 3 level. Twenty-seven patients had sural graft repairs performed with graft lengths varying from 2.5 to 14 cm. Most patients had some nerve regeneration and regained function to Grade 3 to 4 levels by 2 years postoperatively. Four of five patients with suture repairs recovered to Grade 3 or better within 2 years postoperatively. Despite a proximal pelvic level for most of these injuries and, as a result, lengthy graft repairs, recovery of some useful function was the rule rather than the exception. Tumors involved the femoral nerve in 16 patients and included eight neurofibromas, four schwannomas, one neurogenic sarcoma, two ganglion cysts, and one leiomyosarcoma. All tumors were treated surgically and most were removed successfully."
CD008686,0,8545343,0,[Treatment of metastatic cancer of the prostate].,"Rising incidence, resulting from diagnosis together with the increasing age in the population, and high mortality combine to make cancer of the prostate a leading cause of death in men. Despite early, and unfortunately overly optimistic, hopes placed in oestrogen therapy, management of patients with metastatic cancer of the prostate remains one of the major challenges facing urologists. For stage D1 (invasion of the iliac nodes), systemic treatment is required, based on androgen deprivation, with five years disease free survival ranging from 55% to 95%. Radical prostatectomy is not indicated in cases of pathologically confirmed macroscopic nodal involvement, but the question remains controversial for patients with microscopic metastases. Pelvic radiotherapy at ""curative doses"" is not indicated because of the lack of any improvement over hormone therapy alone. Controversies still exist about timing of androgen deprivation (early or deferred endocrine treatment) either for stage D1 or stage D2 asymptomatic patients, but controlled studies are ongoing. Immediate endocrine therapy is however clearly indicated in stage D2 symptomatic disease and leads to improvement of symptoms (mainly bone pain) in up to 80% of patients. When there is spinal cord compression adding corticosteroids can be useful; surgery or radiotherapy are indicated particularly in cases of vertebral instability or neurological involvement. Current protocols are based on maximal androgen deprivation combining medical or surgical castration and anti-androgens. Prognosis is very poor at relapse despite hormone therapy (stage D3). Survival rate at 1 year is only 50%. It is essential that anti-androgens be withdrawn at this time since clinical improvement can be observed in some patients (anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome). None of the second line treatments (hormonal or chemotherapy) have led to any improvement in survival time. Treatments only alleviate patient discomfort and improve quality of life. The lack of progress over the last 50 years in the treatment of advanced stage cancer of the prostate means that the only way to cure future patients will be conditioned by early diagnosis and treatment during the less advanced stages."
CD008686,0,8535211,0,Use of clodronate in multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma is characterized by bone disease including osteoporosis, osteolytic lesions, pathological fractures and hypercalcaemia leading to pain, immobilization and decrease in the quality of life. Clodronate, a bisphosphonate, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypercalcaemia in patients with multiple myeloma. In addition, clodronate reduces the progression of osteolytic lesions and the amount of vertebral fractures and may also relieve pain in these patients. Recent studies suggest that oral clodronate should be considered in the adjunctive treatment of all patients with active multiple myeloma independently of the presence of bone lesions at diagnosis. Due to its safety and efficacy, clodronate seems to have gained an important role in the management of patients with multiple myeloma."
CD008686,0,8530710,0,Recovery of infraorbital nerve function after zygomaticomaxillary cheek pedicled flap.,"The zygomaticomaxillary cheek pedicled flap (ZMCF) involves the intentional section of the infraorbital nerve to reflect the flap laterally in order to give access to the rhinopharynx, clivus and upper cervical spine. The aim of this trial was to examine the recovery of sensation of the infraorbital nerve, both quantitatively (touch sensation, localisation test, two-point discrimination) and qualitatively (sharp/blunt test, temperature sensation, pain sensitivity, dental sensitivity) in 7 patients, at least 12 months after surgery. In each patient, four cutaneous areas (lower eyelid, nose ala, upper lip, cheek) and the upper vestibulum were tested. Results of each test in all the examined areas were evaluated and compared with the data obtained on the nonoperated side (control side). Results of neurosensory tests indicated good recovery of sensation with little difference in comparison with the control side, showing that the functional consequence of ZMCF should actually be considered only as a transitory event."
CD008686,0,7579752,0,Neoplastic meningitis with normal neurological findings. Magnetic resonance imaging results.,"Neoplastic meningitis, an unusual complication of systemic cancer, is becoming more common as cancer patients live longer. Although leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors are usually associated with multifocal neurological signs, the authors report on 4 patients who presented with normal findings on neurological examination. One man had severe headache and complex partial seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed gadolinium enhancement of multiple cranial nerves. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology was positive for melanoma. One woman presented with severe migratory retroorbital headaches. MRIs of the brain with and without gadolinium appeared normal. CSF cytology was positive for pulmonary adenocarcinoma. One man presented with morning headache, and a woman presented with back pain. Both had CSF cytologies positive for lymphoma. Neoplastic meningitis can occur without abnormalities on neurological or MRI examinations. Lumbar punctures should be performed on cancer patients with severe, unusual, or prolonged headaches."
CD008686,0,8941739,0,Implications of malignant lymphoma on a periapical mandibular lesion.,"A patient who sought treatment complained of numbness. A periapical radiolucency had been observed some weeks earlier. He was subsequently treated with endodontic therapy. When he later developed soft-tissue swelling, he was treated with antibiotics. The treatment modalities were consistent with infection control. However, review of the patient's medical history of malignancy would have alerted the dentist to a possible case of metastasis."
CD008686,0,8587716,0,[Sacrococcygeal chordoma: clinico-radiologic and histologic characteristics].,"Chordoma is a rare, slow-growing, malignant tumor which usually localizes in the sacrococcygeal area. The authors report the case of a 36-year-old woman treated by sacral resection by a posterior approach. At admission, the patient reported a 5-month history of sacral pain. Digital rectal examination revealed a presacral mass. CT and above all MR revealed the presence and the precise extent of the mass which involved the last sacral vertebra and the coccyx. Diagnosis was confirmed histologically. Bilateral S-3 nerve roots were preserved. No radiotherapy was given. After 4 years the patients is free of disease."
CD008686,0,8575593,0,Epithelioid haemangioendothelioma of the lung: clinical and pathological pitfalls.,"In 1973, a 10 year old boy presented with numerous bilateral lung nodules, diagnosed as histiocytosis X by open lung biopsy. The patient was treated with prednisone until 1984. In 1993, he developed severe pain in the neck. A biopsy of the spine revealed the same tumour morphology as was seen in the lung in 1973. Immunohistological examination of the former and present biopsy led to the definitive diagnosis of epithelioid haemangioendothelioma of the lung with metastases to spine and liver. Epithelioid haemangioendothelioma of the lung is a rare soft tissue tumour of vascular origin, readily mistaken for carcinoma or, as in this case, histiocytosis. The tumour has an intermediate malignant potential. Although metastases of epithelioid haemangioendothelioma of the lung are well-known, metastatic spread to bones, as in our case, has not previously been mentioned in the literature."
CD008686,0,8535045,0,Medical decision-making in a patient with a history of cancer and chronic non-malignant pain.,"The selection of cancer pain treatment modalities depends on careful assessment to establish the pathophysiology of the pain complaint. Treatment may consist of a single modality--e.g., pharmacotherapy--or multiple modalities--e.g., pharmacotherapy, anesthetic intervention, and radiotherapy for bone pain. Cancer patients may present with pain and multiple concomitant medical problems related to their primary neoplastic disease, complications of cancer treatment, or unrelated conditions including preexisting pain of nonmalignant origin. We present the case of a patient with new onset of pain superimposed on chronic nonmalignant pain. This case emphasizes the need for careful assessment and the close cooperation required between the pain consultant and the referring oncology staff to make optimal treatment decisions in the context of a complex medical illness."
CD008686,0,8532906,0,Single-dose radiotherapy (6 Gy): palliation in painful bone metastases.,"Approximately 50% of patients with cancer develop bone metastases and these have an important influence on the quality of life. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY. To evaluate a lower dose than the one already proven to be effective (8 Gy) in the palliation of painful bone metastases. METHODS AND MATERIALS. In a prospective study we analyzed the pain relief, after a single dose of 6 Gy, in 170 patients with painful bone metastases. This was assessed by a questionnaire. RESULTS. A degree of pain relief, was achieved in 88% of the treatments and there was complete relief in 39%. When the treatment was given to the vertebrae, infield spinal cord compression developed in 9%, and when given to the pelvis or femur, infield fractures developed in 8%. CONCLUSION. We concluded that a single dose of 6 Gy was very effective in the palliation of painful bone metastases."

CD008686,0,7645462,0,MR imaging in the diagnosis of intramedullary spinal cord diseases that involve specific neural pathways or vascular territories.,"Prior to the advent of MR imaging, the internal architecture of the spinal cord could not be directly imaged. The solution of many technical problems (e.g., respiratory motion, cardiac and CSF pulsation, inadequate spatial resolution) has provided the opportunity for an increasingly refined analysis of intramedullary lesions. This article begins with a brief review of the results of high-resolution MR imaging studies of the cadaveric spinal cord. The article then focuses on MR imaging in the diagnosis of intramedullary diseases that involve specific neural pathways or vascular territories. Lesions are categorized as degenerative, inflammatory, traumatic, or ischemic. These diseases generally have distinctive clinical findings that reflect dysfunction of particular ascending sensory tracts or descending motor tracts. The corresponding abnormalities on MR images reflect the pathologic changes that occur in the affected neural pathways. Knowledge of the appearance of these diseases on MR images allows the formation of a narrow differential diagnosis and, in many cases, the confident exclusion of neoplasm as the cause of myelopathy."
CD008686,0,7671476,0,Multicentric plasma cell granuloma of spinal cord meninges.,"A 37-year-old man had multicentric meningeal plasma cell granuloma of the spinal cord. The presenting symptoms were back pain and progressive numbness and weakness of both legs for 6 months. Through physical examination, hypoesthesia below the inguinal region and decreased muscle power of both legs with bilateral ankle clonus was seen. Computed tomographic myelogram and magnetic resonance imaging showed 2 extramedullary intradural masses at the T5 and T12-L1 levels. The latter produced all the neurologic deficits. The patient underwent 2 consecutive operations: laminectomy with removal of the tumor at the T12-L1 level, and thoracotomy with partial corpectomy and removal of the tumor at T5 level. Findings from both operations showed that the tumors arose from the dura and grew inward compressing the spinal cord. Microscopically, these 2 tumors showed identical pictures of plasma cell granuloma and were characterized by numerous granulomas formed by mature plasma cells with Russell bodies and histiocytes set in a fibrotic background. The patient was discharged with complete recovery of sensory and motor functions of both legs."
CD008686,0,7655881,0,Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system.,"There have been 87 cases of superficial siderosis of the CNS reported in the world literature and 63 cases had developed the clinical syndrome with sufficient details to be reviewed. It is a distinct clinical syndrome characterized by sensorineural deafness (95%), cerebellar ataxia (88%) and pyramidal signs (76%). Other features include dementia (24%), bladder disturbance (24%), anosmia (at least 17%), aniscoria (at least 10%) and sensory signs (13%). Less frequent features are extra-ocular motor palsies, neck or backache, bilateral sciatica and lower motor neuron signs (5-10% each). Males are more often affected than females (3:1). The age of onset ranged from 14 to 77 years, age at death from 29 to 78 years and duration until death from 1 to 38 years excluding premature death due to the underlying cause or as a result of surgery. Up to 27% become bed bound at 1-37 years from the first symptom due to either cerebellar ataxia, a myelopathic syndrome or both. Symptomatic subarachnoid haemorrhage occurred in 37% and the CSF was haemorrhagic and/or xanthochromic in 75%. It is now accepted that superficial siderosis is due to chronic subarachnoid haemorrhage and a source of bleeding has been reported in 54% of cases; it was either due to dural pathology (47%) including a CSF cavity lesion or cervical root lesion, a vascular tumour (35%) or a vascular abnormality (18%). Arguments are presented that the remaining cases were also due to chronic haemorrhage and that there is no evidence for a non-haemorrhagic form of superficial siderosis. There have been 14 incidental cases diagnosed by MRI or at post-mortem with no symptoms attributable to superficial siderosis during life, supporting the notion of a pre-symptomatic phase to the illness. In 22 patients who had developed the syndrome, the duration of this pre-symptomatic phase could be calculated and ranged from 4 months to 30 years with an average of 15 years. At present the most promising treatment for superficial siderosis is surgical ablation of the bleeding sources."
CD008686,0,7586852,0,High thoracic neurinoma mimicking femoral neuralgia.,"We report a case of spinal neurinoma at a high thoracic level, whose main presentation was intractable pain in a body part innervated by the right femoral nerve. Sensations of pain and temperature were impaired in the right thigh, but usual symptoms of myelopathy were undetectable. In conjunction with the other reports, this case suggests that spinal tumors at high thoracic levels can produce remote symptoms mimicking peripheral neuropathy such as femoral or sciatic neuralgia."
CD008686,0,7487754,0,MRI of intraspinal nerve sheath tumours presenting with sciatica.,"The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of 14 intraspinal nerve sheath tumours (NST) presenting with sciatica were reviewed. The group comprised seven schwannomas, six neurofibromas and one perineuroma. The tumours were either iso- or hypointense with respect to spinal cord on T1-weighted (T1W) images; almost all tumours were hyperintense compared with spinal cord on T2-weighted (T2W) images. The tumours were all detectable on unenhanced T1W images. Nine NST were scanned following Gadolinium-Diethylenetriamine penta acetic acid (DTPA) injection and all showed intense enhancement. This aids differentiation from sequestrated disc fragments. Tumours were more likely to show homogeneous enhancement unless they were recurrent tumours. Rim enhancement occurs more commonly in schwannomas and this can be used to differentiate these from neurofibromas. However, on unenhanced images, schwannomas cannot be distinguished from neurofibromas. Four tumours occurred at T11-T12. There was poor correlation of the site of the lesion with the clinical findings. MRI studies in patients with sciatica should include the lower thoracic region especially if no protruded disc was found in the lumbar region."
CD008686,0,7793738,0,Reconstruction with myocutaneous flaps following resection of locally recurrent rectal cancer.,"Local or regional recurrence is frequent in patients treated for rectal cancer. Many will die with regional disease in the absence of distant metastases. To achieve cure or palliation, radical surgery resulting in large pelvic defects may be warranted. Myocutaneous flap reconstruction may be used to achieve satisfactory closure. From 1988 to 1993, nine patients (5 female, 4 male) underwent 10 myocutaneous flap reconstructions for large perineal or pelvic defects following surgical extirpation of recurrent rectal cancer at Fox Chase Cancer Center. All nine patients had been previously treated with radiation therapy. Their clinical course was reviewed and quality of life assessed. The mean age at diagnosis of recurrence was 56 years. In six, this was a first, and in three patients a second recurrence. Clinical presentation was most often bleeding, abscess, or perineal pain. Resection was determined by extent of recurrence and included perineal resection, pelvic exenteration, cystectomy, sacrectomy, or coccygectomy. Extent of disease necessitated intraoperative radiation therapy in one case and placement of brachytherapy catheters in four. Bilateral gracilis flaps were used in four, unilateral in three, gluteus maximus in two, and combined gluteal and gracilis flaps in one patient. Six perineal and four combined perineal and vaginal defects were reconstructed. The mean length of surgery was 9.1 hours, and the length of hospitalization averaged 17.5 days. In nine of 10 cases, patients had prehospital level of function at discharge. Acute surgical flap-related complications included three cases of minor wound infection or separation, two of minimal but persistent drainage, and one of vaginal colonization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,7636895,0,The anatomy of the brachial plexus as displayed by magnetic resonance imaging: technique and application.,"Full field of view coronal chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) routinely displays bilateral images of the brachial plexus, surface anatomy, and anatomic structures. Eighty patients had chest radiographs correlated with surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. The PA chest film findings correlated with the surgical findings: smaller thoracic inlet on the concave side of the cervicothoracic spine scoliosis, shorter distance between the dorsal spine of the second or third thoracic vertebral body to the concavity of the first ribs, asymmetric clavicles and coracoid processes, synchondrosis of the first and second ribs, and muscle atrophy on the side of the clinical complaints. More than 235 patients were imaged. One hundred sixty-five of these were imaged with a 1.5-T unit and 3-D reconstruction MRI. Coronal, transverse (axial), oblique transverse, and sagittal plane T1-weighted, selected T2-weighted, and fast spine echo pulse sequences were obtained, 4- to 5-mm slice thickness, 40 to 45 cm full field of view, 512 x 256 matrix and 2 NEX. Two-dimensional time of flight (2D TOF), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) sequences were obtained in selected patients. Coronal, transverse, and sagittal sequences were reformatted for evaluation. Saline water bags were placed between the neck and thorax to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. Compromising abnormalities of the brachial plexus were confirmed at surgery. Compromise of the neurovascular supply seemed to be one etiology that could be demonstrated. The clinical history, technique, and anatomic bilateral brachial plexus imaging is stressed to improve patient care. The cervical rib is one of the compromising brachial plexopathies selected for this presentation."

Oliguria developed a few days later, which was followed by hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. Autopsy disclosed multiple renal cell carcinomas with diffuse metastasis to the liver, adrenal gland, psoas muscle and vertebrae. In addition, a somatostatinoma was found in the pancreas. From these findings and past history of cerebellar hemangioblastoma and spinal hemangioma he was diagnosed to have von Hippel-Lindau disease. Von Hippel-Lindau disease with islet cell tumor is very rare and is reported here with a review of literature."
CD008686,0,7494164,0,"Retinal detachment in a child as the first sign of leukemic relapse: histopathology, MRI findings, treatment, and tumor-free follow up.","Improved leukemia therapies in children have brought about prolonged remissions with extramedullary relapses being reported in sites other than the most common (bone marrow, testes, brain, and spinal cord). A 3-1/2 year-old boy with a history of acute lymphocytic leukemia presented with total retinal detachment in one eye. Painful glaucoma unresponsive to medical therapy necessitated enucleation. Histopathologic examination documented the presence of a dense leukemic cellular infiltrate replacing a totally detached, necrotic retina. Tumor cells also were present in the optic nerve. The child had remained free of leukemia for 3 years after systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy, supplemented by craniospinal radiation. This represents the first case of relapse of acute lymphocytic leukemia presenting solely as a retinal detachment. Our case also underscores the point that the treatment of leukemia after an isolated ocular relapse can be associated with a favorable outcome."
CD008686,0,7781510,0,[The von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Its differential diagnosis from cystic kidneys in adulthood].,"A 51-year-old patient with severe back pain had undergone resection of a benign cerebellar tumour when aged 15 years. In addition, polycystic kidney disease was diagnosed 24 years ago, bilateral phaeochromocytoma 2 years ago, and for 4 months before the present admission he had been on haemodialysis. The family history indicated autosomal dominant inheritance of the polycystic renal disease. His general condition was found to have deteriorated, he had pain on pressure over the upper thoracic and lower lumbar vertebrae, and the kidneys were enlarged on palpation. There were increased concentrations of calcium (3.01 mmol/l), parathormone (2.0 ng/l), carcinoembryonic antigen (13.5 micrograms/l) and TPA (69 U/l). Computed tomography demonstrated cystic and solid parts of much enlarged kidneys. Biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated clear-cell renal carcinoma. Further information concerning the previously removed brain tumour showed this to have been an haemangioblastoma of the cerebellar tonsils indicating the diagnosis of v. Hippel-Lindau disease. Nine other family members had been affected, but none had the full-blown picture of the disease. The patient died 3 weeks later from the rapidly advancing tumour. Autopsy showed the bilateral renal carcinoma, bilateral phaeochromocytoma and metastases to the sternum, femurs, vertebrae and liver."
CD008686,0,7774886,0,Tophaceous pseudogout (tumoral calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease).,"Most cases of calcium deposition seen radiologically in soft tissues are caused by calcium hydroxyapatite and occur either as a complication of trauma with associated necrosis (eg, fat necrosis), generalized connective tissue diseases (eg, scleroderma), metabolic disturbances (eg, hyperparathyroidism, familial hyperphosphatemia), sarcoidosis, myeloma, or metastases. Hydroxyapatite deposits are seen at many soft tissue sites, including joint capsules, ligaments, blood vessels, dermis, etc. On the other hand, deposits of calcium pyrophosphate are seen typically in the meniscus, articular cartilage, ligamentum flavum, and intervertebral disc. They usually are punctate or linear in distribution within the meniscus or parallel to the subchondral bone end plate. We report seven cases of massive focal calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease (tophaceous pseudogout) that occurred in atypical locations for CPPD. The ages of the patients ranged from 31 to 86 years (average, 60.7 years). One patient was male and six were female. The temporomandibular joint was involved in three patients and the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe was involved in two patients. The hip joint and cervical spine were involved in one patient each. A mass or swelling with or without pain was a common symptom. None of the patients in our series had clinical or radiographic evidence of CPPD crystal deposition disease in any other joints. Roentgenograms showed calcified lesions with a granular or fluffy pattern. Histologically, the lesions showed small or large deposits of intensely basophilic calcified material containing needle shaped and rhomboid crystals with weakly positive birefringence characteristic of CPPD. Foreign body granulomatous reaction to the CPPD deposition was constantly found. Chondroid metaplasia around and in the areas of CPPD deposition was observed commonly. Some of the chondroid areas showed cellular atypia in chondrocytes suggestive of a malignant cartilage tumor. It is important to recognize this rare form of CPPD crystal deposition disease and to identify the CPPD crystals in the calcified deposits, thus avoiding the misdiagnosis of benign or malignant cartilaginous lesions."
CD008686,0,7637167,0,[The efficacy of intravenous lidocaine on various types of neuropathic pain].,"We examined the efficacy of systemic local anesthetics on various types of neuropathic pain in 89 patients. Lidocaine 1.5 mg.kg-1 was infused intravenously for one minute. Pain score (PS) by visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-10) was measured 1, 5, 15 and 35 min after the infusion. The efficacy of intravenous lidocaine was evaluated by PS which was lowest after infusion. PS decreased to less than 50 percent of pre-infusion value in more than 75 percent of cases of cancer pain, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, low back pain with signs of root pain or spinal canal stenosis, peripheral nerve injury and thalamic pain, in 50-75 percent of cases of herpetic neuralgia, and in less than 50 percent of cases of cervical spondylosis, spinal cord injury, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, causalgia and psychogenic pain. This study suggests that systemic local anesthetics is effective in neuropathy due to cancer pain, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, low back pain with signs of root pain or spinal canal stenosis, peripheral nerve injury and thalamic pain."

Eighty-five percent of the evaluable symptomatic individuals obtained significant pain relief. Ambulatory ability was retained or regained in 11 (65%) patients. The overall median period of survival was 11 months. Extended median survival was noted in post-treatment ambulatory patients (compared with nonambulatory patients) and in individuals whose primary presentation of PCM was EC (versus individuals who developed EC during the course of the disease). These results suggest that radiotherapy alone may be used in the palliative management of patients with EC by PCM."

PRL-secreting microadenomas have a benign clinical course and may even disappear without treatment. Absolute indications for treatment of hyperprolactinaemia include the need to restore fertility and the presence of a macroadenoma. A dopamine agonist is the treatment of choice regardless of tumour size and will normalize PRL and restore menses in the majority of cases. Hypogonadism induced by hyperprolactinaemia is associated with decreased spinal bone mineral content, but it is not clear whether the bone loss is progressive. Bone mass improves after treatment of the hyperprolactinaemia but does not normalize. The safety of chronic oestrogen therapy in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea who are not desirous of fertility remains to be elucidated by ongoing clinical trials."
CD008686,0,7620356,0,Pathophysiology of tethered cord syndrome.,"Tethered cord syndrome, manifested by motor and sensory dysfunction and incontinence, is caused by excessive tension in the lumbosacral cord.

This theory is derived from redox changes of cytochrome a, a3, and supported by spinal cord blood flow, evoked potential, and histological studies. The well-known finding of elongated spinal cord attached to the tight filum or a tumor is not always demonstrated in imaging studies, and understanding of pathophysiology allows physicians to correctly diagnose and treat patients with tethered cord syndrome."

Cancer-related bone pain, bronchial obstruction, superior vena cava syndrome, spinal cord compression, and central neurologic dysfunction due to brain metastases are all treated effectively and safely by RT. Although numerous techniques and radiation dose fractionation schemes are used in practice, substantial palliation often may be accomplished by just two to 10 appropriately targeted treatments. Thus, palliative RT regimens need not be highly protracted to be effective. Several new techniques, including strontium 89 radiopharmaceutical therapy, high-dose-rate endobronchial brachytherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery, are now being evaluated in clinical trials to determine their efficacy in the relief of various oncologic symptoms. Palliative RT continues to be a mainstay of treatment in the management of cancer patients with advanced disease."

A 40-year-old male patient was diagnosed with NIDDM about 3 years earlier, but he did not receive any treatment. Then, a two-month history of high fever, persistent cough and back pain developed. Chest X-ray film showed a lung infiltrate with a small cavity in the upper portion of the left lung. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the chest revealed a tumor mass shadow with osteoclasia along the bodies of the 6th and 7th thoracic vertebral bone. Staphylococcus aureus infection was confirmed by arterial blood culture. Administration of antibiotics resulted in the disappearance of the left lung infiltrate and a slight reduction of the tumor mass in the thoracic vertebral bone, suggesting pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis as an unusual complication of NIDDM. However, as the tumor mass still remained, needle biopsy for the mass lesion was performed, resulting in the diagnosis of metastasis of small cell carcinoma from the left lung. Gene aberration in this lung disease has been reported recently, and its correlation with NIDDM which may also be induced by genetic abnormality is an interesting question that remains to be resolved."

Neurological examination indicated a loss of short-term memory, signs of meningeal irritation, unsteady gait and falling tendency. Cerebrospinal fluid showed mild pleocytosis and cells suspicious of tumour. Upper abdominal ultrasonography revealed an enlarged gallbladder with contents of soft-tissue density. Magnetic resonance imaging showed numerous round lesions in the brain which looked nodular after contrast-medium injection. Cholecystectomy revealed metastases of a malignant melanoma. It was likely that the cerebral lesions also represented metastases. The confusional state increased in severity.

CD008686,0,7863874,0,"Aneurysmal bone cyst: concept, controversy, clinical presentation, and imaging.","The aneurysmal bone cyst is the result of a specific pathophysiologic change, which is probably the result of trauma or a tumor-induced anomalous vascular process. In approximately one third of cases, the preexisting lesion can be clearly identified. The most common of these is the giant cell tumor, which accounts for 19-39% of cases in which the preceding lesion is found. Other common precursor lesions include osteoblastoma, angioma, and chondroblastoma. Less common lesions include fibrous dysplasia, fibroxanthoma (nonossifying fibroma), chondromyxoid fibroma, solitary bone cyst, fibrous histiocytoma, eosinophilic granuloma, and even osteosarcoma. Interestingly, some of the controversy surrounding this lesion may be the result of a change in how the lesion was defined by Lichtenstein in 1953, when intramedullary lesions were added to the previously described juxtacortical (superficial) lesions. Members of the AFIP have suggested that many of the intramedullary lesions in which no previous lesion can be identified may represent giant cell tumors of bone. Their similarity to proved giant cell tumors in skeletally immature patients can be striking and seems more than coincidental. Appropriate treatment of an aneurysmal bone cyst requires the realization that it results from a specific pathophysiologic process, and identification of the preexisting lesion, if possible, is essential. Clearly an osteosarcoma with superimposed secondary aneurysmal bone cyst change must be treated as an osteosarcoma, and giant cell tumor with secondary features of aneurysmal bone cyst would be expected to be more likely to recur locally. The vast majority (approximately 80%) of patients presenting with aneurysmal bone cystlike findings are less than 20 years old. More than half of all such lesions occur in long bones, with approximately 12-30% of cases occurring in the spine. The pelvis accounts for about half of all flat bone lesions. Most patients present with pain and/or swelling, with symptoms usually present for less than 6 months. The imaging appearance of aneurysmal bone cyst reflects the underlying pathophysiologic change. Radiographs show an eccentric, lytic lesion with an expanded, remodeled ""blown-out"" or ""ballooned"" bony contour of the host bone, frequently with a delicate trabeculated appearance. Radiographs may rarely show flocculent densities within the lesion, which may mimic chondroid matrix. CT scanning will define the lesion and is especially valuable for those lesions located in areas in which the bony anatomy is complex, and which are not adequately evaluated by plain films. Fluid-fluid levels are common and may be seen on CT scans and MR images.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Complementary investigations are mandatory in any case of sciatic pain starting at 80 years of age, even in the absence of the usual criteria suggesting a neoplastic origin. In this case our investigations revealed sacroiliac bone metastasis from the breast, explaining the clinical picture. Primary and secondary sacral tumors are uncommon.

CD008686,0,7739506,0,Human retroviruses and demyelinating diseases.,"The consequences of human retroviral infections have had an unprecedented impact on the medical, scientific, and social institutions of the last two decades of this century. The nervous system as an end target organ figures prominently in the constellation of diseases associated with HTLV and HIV infection and numerous syndrome complexes have been recognized that reflect dysfunction of the brain, spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerves, or muscle. HAM/TSP, associated with HTLV-I and rarely with HTLV-II infections, and encephalomyelitis, associated with HIV infection, may present with clinical, laboratory, neuroelectrophysiologic, and neuroimaging features closely resembling MS. A careful systematic search for associated disease processes and review of the medical history, however should raise the suspicion of possible retroviral infection. In the appropriate setting, because of the pleiotropy in disease expression and the high prevalence of retroviral infection in many areas of the United States, clinicians should have a low threshold for ordering diagnostic testing for HIV and HTLV when considering a retroviral cause for a neurologic disorder. The retroviruses are pervasive throughout the vertebrate subphylum and share common elements within their genome that encode for promoters and structural proteins and are distinguished from each other by sets of transactivating and regulating genes. The latter group of genes serve to regulate viral replication by the induction and post-transcriptional and post-translational modification of retrovirally encoded gene products. In addition, the transactivating gene products can activate and upregulate the expression of a variety of host cellular genes, many of which possess immune-related functions. The viral particle or specific components of certain viral structural proteins may be directly toxic to neural tissues. Also, during the replicative phase, retroviruses are recognized by host defense mechanisms, which mount considerable cellular and humoral immune responses. The spectrum of retroviral-associated neurologic diseases therefore may represent a complex interaction among viral antigen-induced immunity, the production of neurotoxic viral peptides, and the abnormal induction and expression of cellular genes with potent bioactivity."
CD008686,0,7739093,0,[Postoperative pain relief by patient controlled analgesia using intravenous pentazocine].,"Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) by intravenous pentazocine was performed to determine its efficacy and the dose required for the pain relief after gynecological or obstetric operations. After obtaining informed consent, studies were performed on 28 female patients (ASA I, II: Mean age 38.1 years: Mean weight, 53.8 kg) who had received gynecological or obstetric operations with lower abdominal incision. Anesthesia given was nitrous oxide and isoflurane combined with epidural anesthesia with 1% mepivacaine used only during the operation. Six patients had cesarian section under spinal anesthesia. No patients received opioid during anesthesia. PCA was performed with a Graseby PCA pump. Lockout time was 8 minutes and the bolus dose was 3 mg. In all the patients, satisfactory pain relief was obtained and no other analgesic was necessary. Mean initial dose was 169.4 micrograms.kg-1 and the mean doses used for following each 6 hours until 24 hours were 409.7, 368.6, 279.3 and 211.1 micrograms.kg-1 respectively. Evaluation of PCA by the patients after the procedure showed excellent (13 patients) good (12) and passable (3) analgesia. No significant complication was observed except temporary nausea in two patients. Satisfactory postoperative pain relief could be obtained by relatively small doses of pentazocine and adverse reactions related especially to sigma receptor could be avoided."

Later in the same month, he developed overflow incontinence of urine and weakness in his right face. He also noted deafness in his left ear (he had a marked loss of hearing in his right ear since childhood because of otitis media). His weakness in his right leg had progressed, and he was admitted to our service on March 19, 1993. On admission, he was afebrile and BP was 130/50 mmHg. General physical examination was unremarkable. On neurologic examination, he was alert and oriented to all spheres; no dementia was noted nor were detected aphasia, apraxia, and agnosia. His optic fundi were unremarkable; ocular movement appeared normal, however, he complained of diplopia in far vision. Sensation of the face was intact. He had right facial palsy of peripheral type; he was unable to close his right eye, and Bell's phenomenon was observed on attempted eye closure. On the left side, he had facial spasm. He had marked bilateral deafness. He had no dysarthria or dysphagia. The remaining of the cranial nerves were intact. Motor wise, he was unable to stand or walk alone; weakness did not appear to account for his difficulty in gait; manual muscle testing revealed 4/5 weakness in his tibialis anterior muscle, 1/5 in the peroneus longus, 0/5 in his extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus, all on the right side. Brachioradial and quadriceps femoris reflexes were increased to 3/4; plantar response was equivocal on the right side, and flexor on the left.

MDT consists of an incision and bipolar coagulations performed ventro-laterally in the Dorsal Root Entry Zone (DREZ) at the entrance of the rootlets into the dorso-lateral sulcus. The lesion is directed at 45 degrees ventro-medially, and 2-3 mm deep according to the pre-operative neurological status and the desired effects. MDT 1 degree interrupts the small (nociceptive) fibres regrouped laterally and the large (myotatic) afferents which runs centrally, whilst sparing part of the large medial (lemniscal) fibres. 2 degrees destroys the (excitatory) medial part of the Lissauer's tract, 3 degrees and the cells of the dorsalmost layers of the dorsal horn, which can be the site of hyperactivity, as we were able to record in patients with deafferentation pain. Best indications are: 1) well localized cancer pain, such as Pan-coast syndrome; 2) neuropathic pain due to: brachial plexus injuries, cauda equina and/or spinal cord lesions especially for pain corresponding to segmental lesions, peripheral nerve injuries-amputation-herpes zoster-(especially when the predominant component of pain is of the paroxysmal type and/or corresponds to provoked hyperalgesia/allodynia); 3) excess of spasticity and 4) neurogenic hyperactive bladder."
CD008686,0,8748600,0,The Duke experience with the nucleus caudalis DREZ operation.,"The nucleus caudalis DREZ operation has been performed in three phases at Duke. Between 1982 and 1988 radiofrequency (RF) lesions were made in the trigeminal nucleus extending from the C2 root to the obex using a straight electrode. Complications include ipsilateral arm ataxia due to spinocerebellar tract injury and ipsilateral lower limb weakness from the pyramidal tract. The former occurred at least transiently in 90% of cases. The electrode employed from 1988 to 1989 had proximal insulation protecting the spinocerebellar tract. Since 1989 a ninety degree bend has been added to the electrode to allow better placement. Two electrodes are used to accommodate the shape of the caudalis nucleus. A total of 101 procedures have been performed. The newest electrodes were used in 46 procedures. Ataxia is recognized in 39%. Overall pain relief was excellent in 34% and good in 40%. In post herpetic neuralgia 71% enjoyed excellent or good relief. Indications include post herpetic neuralgia, deafferentation pain (anaesthesia dolorosa, post-tic dysesthesia, stroke, MS, gasserian tumour, Gamma Knife radiation injury), facial trauma/surgery, atypical facial pain, and migraine/cluster headache.

CD008686,0,8748596,0,Spinal cord stimulation versus spinal infusion for low back and leg pain.,"The relative roles of spinal cord stimulation and the spinal infusion of opioids in the treatment of chronic, non-cancer lower body pain remains unclear. This report contains a retrospective analysis of patients with chronic lower body, neuropathic pain and treated over a 5 year period. Unilateral leg and/or buttock pain was treated initially with spinal stimulation and bilateral leg or mainly low back pain was treated initially with spinal infusions. 26 patients received spinal stimulation. Pain relief was > or = 50% in 16 (62%) with increased activity levels. Stimulator coverage was most difficult or failed in patients with buttock pain. 16 patients received long-term spinal infusions. Pain relief was > or = 50% in 2 (13%) but 25-49% in another 8 (50%) with stable infusion doses and was best in patients requiring low-dose (< 1 mg/h morphine intrathecal) infusions in the trial period. The review indicates that spinal infusions may be best for bilateral or axial pain that has not responded to spinal stimulation. Clonidine appears to be an alternative in high-dose morphine patients. New diamond-shaped electrode and dual quadripolar arrays appear to be very helpful for back, buttock, and/or bilateral leg pain patterns."
CD008686,0,8748593,0,Transplantation of human chromaffin cells for control of intractable cancer pain.,"Adrenal medullary chromaffin cells produce high levels of endogenous opioid peptides. Recent data suggest that transplantation injected locally into the spinal subarachnoid space reduced intractable malignant pain. In order to determine the feasibility, the efficacy and the risks of using adrenal medullary tissue for control of irreducible pain, we have developed a transplantation protocol on cancer pain patients selected when they required chronic intrathecal injection of morphine and progressively increasing doses to maintain the level of analgesic effects. At the present time, our clinical trial involves 8 patients. We report here our initial results (mean follow-up: 5 months). The various data collected before and after the intrathecal administration of chromaffin cells included: 1) Pain evaluation over time, with concomitant narcotic intake, 2) CSF sampling through an implanted access port to determine the following biological parameters: biochemical assay for opioid peptides, cell count and phenotyping of lymphocytes, 3) peripheral blood samples for lymphocyte typing. The results confirm the efficacy of adrenal medullary transplantation into spinal CSF for controlling irreducible cancer pain. Complementary intrathecal and oral morphine were totally stopped in 2 cases and stabilized in 5 others. It seems essential to have an important volume of grafted tissue to achieve analgesia with high levels of metenkephalin in CSF. A progressive decrease in metenkephalin release was observed from 2 to 4 months after the transplantation. Two patients with a long-term follow-up (8 and 12 months) needed another intrathecal chromaffin cell graft."
CD008686,0,8748592,0,Electrophysiological monitoring during CT-guided percutaneous cordotomy.,"During percutaneous cordotomy, impedance monitoring and electric stimulation have been widely used to enable a precise localization of the lesion electrode. The purpose of this study was to examine the possibility that the usage of additional electrophysiological techniques could help in improving the precision of the placement of the lesion electrode. Fourteen patients were monitored with 4 different techniques during CT-guided percutaneous cordotomy: 1) Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (mSEP): median nerve stimulation with recording from the scalp. 2) Spinal cord evoked potentials (SCEP): median nerve stimulation with recording via the cordotomy electrode. 3) Spinothalamic evoked potentials (SthEP): stimulation via the cordotomy electrode and recording from the scalp. Ipsilateral and contralateral mSEPs and SCEPs did not change after the lesion. SthEPs showed a significant decrease in 10 of 12 patients provided the stimulus intensity was kept below that producing a motor response (approx 0.5-1 mA). There was no obvious relationship between changes of the evoked potentials and the clinical outcome of the cordotomy. Our results suggest that there may be a relationship between the extent of the lesion and the decrease of the spinothalamic evoked potentials."

Cerebro-spinal fluid and serum were taken before each intrathecal methotrexate administration according to central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis or treatment of CNS involvement by neoplasm. Patients were divided into two groups. Group I consisted of 5 individuals with clinical manifestations of CNS involvement by leukemia or lymphoma. Group II contained 33 patients without neurological symptoms. Besides, group II was subdivided into other two groups: group IIa-patients with BBB analysis before cytostatics application, and group IIb-patients in which BBB was analysed after the administration of at least one cycle of protocols, used in general chemotherapy, including intrathecal methotrexate injection. In group I BBB changes were observed in 10 out of 12 assessments (sensitivity 83.3%). In group II BBB impairment was revealed in 11 out of 52 assessments (specificity 78.8%). The differences in QAlb values between groups I and II were statistically significant (p = 0.0008), whereas there were no significant differences between QAlb values in groups IIa and IIb. Basing on their investigations, the authors conclude that neoplasm invading CNS should be considered as essential risk of BBB impairment, whereas intrathecal and general chemotherapy appear to be less important in BBB injury."
CD008686,0,7881234,0,Effect of intrathecal saline injection and Valsalva maneuver on cerebral perfusion pressure during transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary macroadenoma.,"Cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) was monitored through a lumbar intrathecal catheter in 32 patients undergoing transsphenoidal excision of pituitary macroadenomas. In the first 20 patients, standardized intermittent Valsalva maneuvers were followed by intrathecal saline injections in 2.5-ml increments. Their effects on CSFP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and therefore, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were compared. The increase in CSFP produced by one Valsalva maneuver (4 +/- 2 mm Hg) was similar to that produced by a single increment of intrathecal saline (4 +/- 2 mm Hg), but the effect of saline was more sustained. With Valsalva maneuvers, the maximum CSFP produced was 13 +/- 4 mm Hg, and the CPP decreased to 50 +/- 14 mm Hg, whereas with saline, the maximum CSFP was 25 +/- 7 mm Hg, and the CPP decreased to 59 +/- 13 mm Hg. Because the increase in CSFP was greater and better sustained with intrathecal saline, Valsalva maneuvers were omitted in the next 12 patients. Peroperative data, including surgical conditions, and post-operative morbidity, with special reference to low-pressure headache and meningeal infection, were analyzed in all 32 patients. Operative conditions produced with intrathecal saline were judged excellent or good in 75% of patients. However, because this technique can decrease the CPP excessively, we recommend that it be used only with continuous CSFP monitoring."

Cooperative and retrospective study on 20 years of follow-up].,"The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the long-term spinal cord stimulation (SCS) efficacy and safety, with a 20-years study concerning 692 patients (series I: 279, series II: 413). The series concern 304 arachno-epidural fibrosis, 152 peripheral nerve lesions, 25 amputations pain, 17 plexus brachial lesions, 101 spinal cord lesions, 22 cancer pain, and 71 vascular pain. A multidisciplinary chronic pain evaluation must exclude contra-indications (nociceptive pain, serious drug habituations, psychological problems, unresolved issues or secondary pain). Percutaneous epidural SCS is a screening method if the trial is sufficiently prolonged (3 to 14 days) and if the pain topography is overlapped by induced paresthesias. The immediate global results of the 2 series are similar: respectively 86% and 85% of success one month after implantation. With the same longterm follow-up (mean: 10 yrs, range: 2-20), and the same evaluation criteria, the percentage of long-term global success rate is 54% in series I, and 52% in series II. In the most recent period (1984-1990) concerning 301 patients, the success rate are respectively 68% and 60%. Analysing the results etiologically confirms the therapeutic value of SCS for neurogenic pain secondary to partial deafferentation. For upper limb pain, ipsilateral radicular stimulation is preferable. When the nerve lesion extends to the pre-ganglionic portion (brachial plexus avulsion, herpes zoster) or in cases of pain of spinal or cerebral origin, thalamic stimulation must be considered, after failure of SCS."
CD008686,0,7600150,0,Combined anterior and posterior resection and spinal stabilization for aneurysmal bone cyst.,"We report on a 19-year-old man with a 6-month history of pain and stiffness in the upper cervical region who proved to have a lytic lesion affecting the anterior and posterior elements of C2-4, causing a severe gibbous deformity at C3. The tumour was excised through a posterior approach, and spinal fusion with instrumentation was performed. Two weeks later, through a right-sided, anteromedial approach, the remaining tumour was excised, and the spine was reconstructed with tricortical iliac bone as a strut graft. The patient was placed in a Minerva jacket for 3 months, during which time a solid fusion was obtained. The histological diagnosis was aneurysmal bone cyst. The patient has remained pain free and suffered no recurrence 2 and a half years after surgery. Involvement of several adjacent cervical vertebrae by an aneurysmal bone cyst is rare, and conventional treatment with curettage and bone grafting is most likely to carry a high rate of recurrence and spinal instability. We recommend complete excision of the tumour in a combined staged procedure and instrumentation to prevent recurrence and avoid instability."
CD008686,0,7576272,0,Surgical management of spinal cord cavernoma.,"Three cases of surgically verified intramedullary cavernous angioma (cavernoma) of the spinal cord are reported. Intramedullary cavernomas of the cord are quite uncommon and account for between 3 and 12% of all vascular lesions of the spinal cord. Little is known of their natural history, although their tendency to produce haemorrhage and episodic symptomatic worsening is recognized. Our series includes one male and two females whose ages ranged between 31 and 67 years. The most common presenting symptom was pain, which in all cases preceded weakness. In two of our cases, the typical progression of sudden paroxysmal worsening of symptoms accompanied by pain was noted. This was thought to be related to bleeding in the lesion. In this series, an average of 8 years had elapsed after the onset of symptoms before the patients came to surgery. Standard microsurgical technique facilitated removal of the lesions, following which all patients regained preoperative function."
CD008686,0,7553009,0,Osteoid osteoma in the differential diagnosis of persistent joint pain.,"We report 20 cases (13 male and 7 female), mean age 21 years) of juxta-articular osteoid osteoma. The distribution of affected joints was as follows: hip joint (7 cases), knee joint (2 cases), ankle joint (2 cases); iliosacral joint (2 cases), lumbar spine (2 cases), carpus (2 cases), shoulder (1 case), second metacarpal (MCP; 1 case) and first metatarsal (MTP; 1 case). The duration between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis varied from 8 months to approximately 4 years. In juxta-articular osteoid osteoma, the clinical picture and the radiographic findings are often atypical, and this may lead to misdiagnosis and delayed definitive treatment. In young patients with persistent undiagnosed pain, the possibility of an osteoid osteoma should be considered. When the clinical picture is suggestive but radiological findings are negative, we must proceed to further investigation with bone scintigraphy and computed tomography. These examinations should be repeated 1 year after the onset of symptoms because initially negative findings may become positive at a later date. When the diagnosis of an osteoid osteoma is confirmed, surgical excision leads to complete relief of the symptoms."
CD008686,0,7551339,0,Anaplastic large cell Ki-1 lymphoma with bone involvement: report of two cases.,"Two cases of anaplastic large cell Ki-1 lymphoma involving bone as the most prominent and initial manifestation are reported. The first patient was a 20-year-old male who had back pain and incomplete paraparesis due to vertebral involvement. The second was a 14-year-old girl, whose first clinical signs were fever of unknown origin and sternal bone pain. Radiologically, skeletal lesions were lytic and destructive. Histopathologically, the tumour cells had pleomorphic bizarre nuclei and abundant basophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, Ki-1(CD30) reactivity was strongly positive in both cases. Tumour cells were also CD3, CD4, epithelial membrane antigen and interleukin-2 receptor positive in the first case, and CD10, HLA-DR positive in the second case. The former tumour was considered to be of T-cell lineage and the latter of lymphoid progenitor cell origin. Radiation and chemotherapy were temporarily effective. However, both patients died 14 and 7 months after diagnosis, respectively, due to systemic lymph node involvement. These observations suggest that the prognosis for Ki-1 lymphoma involving bone is poorer than indicated in previous reports."
CD008686,0,7547456,0,Syringomyelia of the distal spinal cord in children.,"The syndrome of syringomyelia in children has been extensively described in the literature and is said to most commonly involve the cervical and thoracic spinal cord. We here present two children who had an unusual constellation of signs and symptoms, characterized by bowel and bladder disturbance in one, and in the other with intermittent paroxysmal severe pain and cramping and flexion of the lower extremities accompanied at times by episodes of incontinence. Both were found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to have a syrinx localized to the most distal cord. This was not associated with Arnold-Chiari malformation, trauma, tumors or any other form of spinal dysraphism. Both patients underwent placement of a syringomyelia-peritoneal shunt with complete resolution of symptomatology. Postoperative MRI revealed a complete collapse of the syringomyelia cavity. In those children presenting with bowel or bladder disturbances, associated or not with intermittent pain, flexion attacks, or cramping in the lower extremities, the differential diagnosis of a syringomyelia of the distal cord should be part of the clinical considerations."
CD008686,0,7534426,0,"[Value of local radiotherapy in treatment of osseous metastases, pathological fractures and spinal cord compression].","Local radiotherapy plays an important and responsible role in the management of bone metastases. The valence will be described according to the different treatment objectives in the sense of pain relief, remineralization and cord decompression. Radiotherapy schedules, aimed at the relief pain, need to take into consideration life expectancy. Patients with a reduced life expectancy could have a good high chance of achieving pain relief with a single dose of 8 Gy. Patients with a solitary metastasis, patients with a longer life expectancy and patients with a pathological fracture should be treated with 'curative' irradiation doses, aimed at killing the maximum number of tumor cells. In addition to pain relief, remineralization is also an important treatment goal. Conventional radiotherapy with doses of 40-50 Gy resulted in pain relief in 70-100% and in remineralization in 60-80% of the patients. Remineralization could not be accelerated by short-course fractionation courses, but resulted in faster pain relief. Short-course fractionation schedules are not indicated as a 'standard' treatment in the vertebral column. Surgery is the treatment of choice for immediate cord decompression and stabilization of a pathological vertebral fracture. Radiotherapy alone could decrease neurological impairment and is suitable for patients with gradual onset and progression of symptoms, no spinal instability and lesions of the cauda equina."
CD008686,0,7478016,0,Thoracic and lumbar meningocele in neurofibromatosis type 1. Report of two cases and review of the literature.,"We report two cases of ventrolateral thoracic and lumbar meningoceles associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, and present a review of the literature. Thoracic and lumbar meningoceles are rare lesions which are associated with neurofibromatosis in 60% to 85% of cases. Large meningoceles may cause pain, neurological signs, or respiratory complaints when located intrathoracically. Surgery is indicated in such cases, as well as when small meningoceles enlarge with time. The etiology of meningoceles in neurofibromatosis remains controversial. The authors postulate that ventrolateral lesions of the thoracic and lumbar spine are secondary to congenital mesodermal dysplasia and hypoplastic bone changes. MRI is the diagnostic method of choice, since it most adequately visualizes the pathological anatomy of the spinal cord, meninges, and adjacent structures in every sectional plane. CT scans are particularly useful in assessing the spinal bony changes."
CD008686,0,7596766,0,[Radiotherapy for vertebral metastases: analysis of symptoms and clinical effects by MR imaging].,"Fifty patients with 63 symptomatic vertebral metastases (18 sites: pain only, 28 sites: radiculopathy with pain, 17 sites: myelopathy) were treated by radiotherapy. Primary lesions were located in the lung (9 cases), breast (9 cases) colorectal area (9 cases), prostate (7 cases) and so on. We correlated the radiologic findings, symptoms and clinical effects with metastatic features which were classified into 4 types by MR imaging: non-deformity, expanding, vertebral collapse, and destructive mass. Each type of metastasis was accompanied with or without epidural tumor. Osteolytic metastases were apt to create features of deformity (expanding type: 18 vertebrae, vertebral collapse type: 17 vertebrae, destructive mass type: 9 vertebrae). The features of osteoblastic metastases were no deformity (18 vertebrae) and expanding type (2 vertebrae). The symptom of pain only occurred most frequently in the lumbosacral spine. The vertebral body deformity of symptomatic sites was relatively slight (non-deformity type: 6 sites, expanding type: 6 sites, vertebral collapse type: 6 sites), and epidural tumors were seen at only 2 sites. The effect of radiotherapy was excellent (complete pain relief: 64.7%, partial pain relief: 29.4%). Radiculopathy occurred most frequently in the lumbar spine. Vertebral body deformity was noted in most symptomatic sites (expanding type: 9 sites, vertebral collapse type: 10 sites, destructive mass type: 2 sites). Complete relief was obtained in 6 sites (22. 2%), partial relief in 18 (63.0%). Myelopathy occurred most often in the thoracic spine, followed by the lumbar spine. The vertebral body deformity was severe (expanding type: 3 cases, vertebral collapse type: 3 cases, destructive mass type: 6 cases). Epidural tumors were also present in all but one case. Six of 13 patients treated with radiation alone improved. These 6 patients had non-deformity or expanding types with epidural tumor. No improvement was seen in the vertebral collapse type with epidural tumor or destructive mass type."
CD008686,0,7813926,0,[Bacterial arthritis with E. coli in an elderly patient].,"Infectious arthritis is mostly caused by hematogenous spread of Gram-positive bacteria, which often infects a previously damaged joint. During the past 20 years there has been a notable increase in joint infections caused Gram-negative bacteria. They develop mostly in patients with systemic diseases, such as malignancy, cirrhosis or HIV infection, which cause an immune deficient state. We present an 84-year old man admitted because of fever and a diagnosis of pneumonia. During hospitalization he complained of pain in his right knee. On physical examination there was evidence of local inflammation. Infection with E. coli originating in the urinary tract was diagnosed, based on synovial fluid, blood and urine cultures. He was treated with antibiotics intravenously, the knee was surgically drained, and he was discharged 4 weeks after admission. There was no underlying systemic disease in this case that could have caused an immune deficient state, which could promote the Gram-negative joint infection. The case is presented to draw attention to the possibility of infectious arthritis in an elderly patient presenting with fever. In such cases the location of the infection may not be obvious if the infected joint is deeply located parts of bones such as those of the hip, shoulder, or vertebrae. In these cases the diagnosis may be overlooked or delayed and irreversible damage to the infected joint may result."
CD008686,0,7978609,0,Cervical fracture as the initial presentation of multiple myeloma.,Cervical-spine injury may occur in elderly patients with a history of minor trauma. We present the case of a patient who suffered a pathologic cervical-spine fracture as the initial presentation of multiple myeloma. A review of the medical conditions that predispose the elderly to cervical-spine fracture in the absence of major trauma is presented.
CD008686,0,7884002,0,Reinnervation of the trapezius muscle after radical neck dissection.,"Based on the observation, that the caudal parts of the trapezius muscle after radical neck dissection with complete loss of the spinal accessory nerve, are still innervated to an individually varying degree, and on recent anatomical findings relating to this fact, a method for completely reinnervating the trapezius muscle, despite uncompromising radicality of the dissection, is introduced. This procedure consists of identifying and dislodging a subfascial branch of the deep cervical plexus running to the caudal parts of the trapezius muscle in the lateral cervical triangle and anastomosing it to the distal stump of the accessory nerve, using microsurgical techniques, thereby connecting it to the whole innervation system of the muscle. Clinical and electromyographical examinations showed very good recovery of all three portions of the muscle, 15 months after the procedure, in 46 of 52 patients (85%), although these patients were preselected by temporarily blocking the accessory nerve prior to operation, as possessing very little additional nerve supply."
CD008686,0,7873844,0,Use of titanium implants in pedicular screw fixation.,"Several types of pedicular screw systems have been utilized to augment lumbar spine fusion. All systems are made of stainless steel, which interferes with imaging techniques, especially MRI and CT scans. In search of a solution for this problem, we decided to study the use of titanium systems in the lumbar spine. Because there were no titanium pedicle screw systems available on the market, we decided to use the titanium Alta system currently used for femur fractures. This report details our experience in using this device for lumbar spine fusion. From 1990 to 1992, 25 patients underwent thoracic and lumbar fusion with Alta titanium screws and plates. Spinal fusion was performed for a variety of conditions, including metastatic tumor, fracture, spondylolisthesis, pseudoarthrosis, and postdecompressive instability. All but two patients obtained solid fusion clinically and radiographically and considerable improvement in back pain. There was loosening of the implant in both patients. Both patients had osteoporosis. One of these two patients developed pseudoarthrosis, which required further surgery. The other patient with a metastatic tumor of the spine remained asymptomatic without change in the spine alignment despite progression of the tumor. There were no broken screws encountered during follow-up. Two patients sustained subsequent fracture of the vertebra above the fusion. One of the patients also developed a fracture below the fusion. Fusion with titanium implants allowed postoperative evaluation and subsequent periodic examination of the spinal canal with high-quality MR images as well as significant reduction of artifacts on CT scan.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,7858370,0,Etidronic acid. A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy in resorptive bone disease.,"Etidronic acid is an orally and intravenously active bisphosphonate, which is believed to inhibit resorption of bone via a number of cellular mechanisms, including alteration of osteoclastic activity. In studies of patients with symptomatic Paget's disease, etidronic acid 5 to 20 mg/kg/day administered orally rapidly decreased the biochemical indices of bone turnover. Mineralisation defects in forming bone may be avoided by the use of an initial dosage of 5 mg/kg/day for up to 6 months; dosages above 10 mg/kg/day should be limited to 3 months' duration, and dosages greater than 20 mg/kg/day should be avoided. Although 3-day intravenous therapy with etidronic acid 7.5 mg/kg/day has shown superior efficacy to rehydration and forced diuresis in the management of hypercalcaemia of malignancy, the efficacy of the drug is lower than that of the newer bisphosphonates, pamidronic acid and clodronic acid. Clinical studies involving postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis have indicated that oral etidronic acid 400 mg/day for 14 days as part of a 90-day cycle, repeated for up to 3 years, increases the bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar vertebrae and appears to reduce the incidence of vertebral fracture. Published data suggest that etidronic acid shows similar efficacy to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in these respects. The above dosage also appears to be effective in preventing corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis when administered as part of an intermittent, cyclical regimen. Etidronic acid in higher dosages (10 to 20 mg/kg/day orally) is effective in reducing the incidence of heterotopic ossification and its ensuing complications in both neurological and post-surgical patients. Etidronic acid is well tolerated by the majority of patients, with gastrointestinal complaints reported most commonly, but tends to delay the normal mineralisation of forming bone when administered continuously at higher dosages for prolonged periods. This is of little consequence where short term treatment is involved, but may be detrimental to those patients receiving longer courses of therapy. This effect may be minimised or avoided by using the lowest effective dosage for as short a time as possible (as in the above recommendations for Paget's disease), or by the use of intermittent cyclical therapy (as in the management of osteoporosis). Etidronic acid therefore retains a role in the management of resorptive bone disease, particularly in the treatment of Paget's disease, the prevention of heterotopic ossification, and as a second-line option in postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, the development of newer bisphosphonates requires that these compounds be continually compared and re-evaluated."
CD008686,0,7845515,0,[An adult case of lumbar intradural lipoma].,"A 42-year-old female with intradural lipoma at the level of L1 is reported. She was admitted with a history of 32 months of lumbago, 25 months of pain of the left leg, and 12 months of motor weakness in the left leg. Neurologically, sensory impairment below the L1 dermatome of the left leg, and motor weakness of bilateral legs were noted on admission. CT demonstrated a low density mass with no contrast enhanced effect at the level of L1. MRI showed a mass with high signal intensity on the T1-weighted image, and low signal intensity on the T2. L1 laminectomy, and additional Th12 and L2 partial laminectomy were performed and the tumor was partially removed. The tumor was completely in the intradural space. Pathologically, the tumor consisted of mature adipose cells with normal vessels. Postoperatively, the epidural effusion at the operative area caused sensory impairment and motor weakness of the right leg. Finally, the patient came to be neurologically free of defects except for slight sensory diminution of the L4 dermatome of the left leg. In this case, total removal of the tumor was difficult because of adhesion between the tumor, the cauda equina and the conus medullaris. Postoperatively, neurological findings showed a marked improvement. The preoperative neurological deterioration in this case seemed to be associated with simple compression exerted on the nerves."
CD008686,0,7845508,0,"[""Skip lesions"" in neurological deficits caused by tethered cord syndrome].","The neurological deficits caused by tethered cord syndrome do not necessarily follow a dermatomal pattern of the affected spinal cord from caudal to cephalic fashion. The authors defined these neurological deficits as ""skip lesions"", and reviewed the neurological deficits in tethered cord syndrome. Among 29 cases, inconsecutive segmental motor weakness in 3 cases, inconsecutive segmental sensory impairment in 6 cases, positive Babinski reflex in 8 cases, supranuclear neurogenic bladder in 3 cases and lumbago or leg pain in 4 cases were observed and they were thought to be compatible with the neurological deficits called ""skip lesions"". The basic mechanism of this sign is that the cephalic portion of the spinal cord is functionally impaired during flexion of the lumbosacral spine, while the caudal spinal cord with decreased visco-elasticity dose not elongate. Inconsecutive motor-sensory disturbance, accelerated deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities, positive Babinski or other pathological reflexes in the lower extremities, uninhibited neurogenic bladder, lumbago and pain in the legs were considered to belong to the category of ""skip lesions"" and they can be treated by the untethering procedure. The authors concluded that preoperative careful insight into the mechanism of ""skip lesions"" revealed surgical efficacy for the reversible neurological deficits by the untethering procedure, or the efficacy of decompression of the lipoma or neurolysis around the involved spinal nerve roots."

CD008686,0,7990276,0,[Significance of surgical treatment for bone metastasis from lung cancer].,"To assess significance of surgical therapy for patients who had metastatic bone tumor from primary lung cancer, sites of recurrence in patients who underwent surgical resection for lung cancer lesions were analyzed. Clinical courses of patients who underwent surgical therapy for metastatic bone tumor were analyzed, too. 1) From 1985 to 1989, 88 patients died from lung cancer in our hospital who has underwent pulmonary resection for lung cancer lesions. Of these, 22 patients had metastatic bone tumor. Sixty patients died who had underwent complete resection for lung cancer lesions. In eight patients of these 60 cases, bone were first site of recurrence. Of these eight patients, length from pulmonary resection to detection of bone metastasis were 4-23 months. In the other hand, length from detection of bone metastasis of death were 3-24 months. There was no correlation between two length. All of these eight patients had another metastatic lesions at the time of death. 2) From 1985 to July 1993, twelve patients underwent surgical therapy for their bone metastasis of primary lung cancer. Of these, four had metastatic cancer in thoracic vertebral body, two had in clavicle, two had in rib, three had in femoral bone, another had in tibial bone. Objective of operation were improvement of paralysis or pain, prevention of fracture, and so on. Most cases succeeded to get improvement in a short time, but some cases got worse soon. Surgical treatment was effective to improve paralysis or pain, and to increase quality of life. But it can not be effective except appropriate management in a short time because another symptom raise soon."
CD008686,0,7983111,0,Sacral insufficiency fractures in the elderly.,"Sacral insufficiency fractures are not uncommon in elderly patients. We have diagnosed 20 cases in a five-year period, and have reviewed the clinical records, radiographs, CT and bone scans. We also assessed the degree of osteoporosis by measuring bone density using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and bone histomorphometry, and monitored the patients' functional outcome. Bone scans were positive in all 20 patients, CT showed a fracture or sclerosis in 7 of 12 patients and was useful in excluding malignancy. Plain radiographs were the least helpful, showing sclerosis in only 4 of the 20 patients. Involutional osteoporosis with a reduced bone formation rate was the most common underlying cause. Seventeen patients had complete resolution of pain within nine months, and no patient lost independence in daily activities. Increased awareness of these fractures may help to avoid unnecessary investigation and treatment. Bedrest and analgesia followed by rehabilitation provide good relief of symptoms."
CD008686,0,7962023,0,Acute calcific retropharyngeal tendinitis. Clinical presentation and pathological characterization.,"Acute calcific retropharyngeal tendinitis is an underrecognized cause of pain and stiffness in the neck associated with odynophagia and retropharyngeal soft-tissue swelling. We report on five patients in whom an initial misdiagnosis of this entity as a retropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal abscess, a neoplasm, or a fracture-dislocation of the cervical spine led to interventions such as admission to the hospital and parenteral administration of antibiotics. An open biopsy was performed in one patient because of a suspected neoplasm. Evaluation of the tissue specimen with routine and polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectrometry demonstrated a foreign-body inflammatory response to deposited crystals of hydroxyapatite. In all five patients, the correct diagnosis was established only after retrospective review of the radiographic studies by a physician who was familiar with acute calcific retropharyngeal tendinitis. The computed tomographic findings of acute calcific retropharyngeal tendinitis are distinctive and consist of prevertebral calcification localized to the insertion of an edematous tendon of the longus colli muscle. Symptomatic relief was provided with anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications. The symptoms resolved, without sequelae, within one to two weeks for all of the patients. We hope that an increased awareness of hydroxyapatite deposition in the tendon of the longus colli muscle will result in improved early diagnosis of acute calcific retropharyngeal tendinitis."

CD008686,0,7889688,0,Benign extramedullary tumors in the foramen magnum region.,"We present 16 cases of benign extramedullary tumors of the foramen magnum region who were operated on between the years 1984 and 1992. On admission, no case was neurologically intact and over 50% had had symptoms for more than 1 year. Nine patients had erroneous diagnoses initially. CT myelography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were the most appropriate diagnostic tools in visualizing tumors of this region. All operations except one, were performed by the posterior approach without surgical mortality. Histopathological examination revealed 8 meningiomas, 6 neurinomas, one tuberculous abscess and one neurenteric cyst which has not been reported at this location before. Patients with minor to moderate disability on admission showed good functional results without any recurrences during follow-up."

She had been suffered from bronchial asthma since 1979 for which prednisolone had been prescribed. She noted an onset of pain around her nose in October, 1989, which extended into the periorbital regions bilaterally. In February, 1990, she was treated with stellate ganglion block and trigeminal nerve block; these treatments partially alleviated her pain. In May of 1991, she noted a difficulty in swallowing solid foods. In November of the same year, she developed right facial paresis; two weeks later, she noted numbness in her left face, and was hospitalized to our service on December 16, 1991. On admission, she was afebrile and general physical examination was unremarkable except for piping rales in her both lung fields. On neurologic examination, she was alert and oriented to all spheres; higher cerebral functions were intact. In the cranial nerves, her olfactory sense was lost bilaterally; her vision was markedly diminished bilaterally only to recognize hand movements; the optic fundi appeared normal; the pupils were isocoric and reacted to light promptly. The extraocular muscles were moderately weak to most of the directions more on the left; no nystagmus was present. Facial sensation was diminished bilaterally; the jaw deviated to right; right facial paresis of peripheral type was present; her hearing was diminished bilaterally more on the right. The movement of the soft palate was diminished on the right side; dysphagia was present; her voice was horse; the gag reflex was diminished. The sternocleidomastoid muscle was weak bilaterally; the tongue appeared normal. Examination of gait was differed because of headache, however, no apparent motor weakness was present. No ataxia or involuntary movement was noted. Deep reflexes were normally elicited and symmetric. Plantar response was flexor. Sensation in the extremities was intact. Kernig's sign was positive at 70 degree leg extension; eyeball tenderness was also present bilaterally, however, no nuchal stiffness was noted. Following abnormalities were present in the laboratory examination: WBC 11,400/microliters, ESR 50 mm/hr, CRP 6.1 mg/dl. The lumbar CSF was under a normal pressure containing 29 WBC/microliters (neutrophils 7, lymphocytes 20, others 2), 67 mg/dl of protein, and 53 mg/dl of sugar; cultures for acid-fast bacilli as well as for other bacteria were negative; no malignant cells were found.

Involvement of the thyroid gland has rarely been reported. We report a case in a patient with a non-tender swelling of the thyroid, whose symptoms, sonographic and scintigraphic features mimicked carcinoma. Initially the patient presented with back pain due to a paravertebral mass. Fine needle aspiration and culture of the aspirate both from the paravertebral mass and the thyroid ensured the diagnosis. Although seldom observed, tuberculosis should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of nodular lesions of the thyroid.

The cervical spine is the least frequent site of spinal epidural abscess. It has been reported that early diagnosis and surgical treatment prevent neurological deficit, but it is difficult to diagnose this disease clinically. We presented a rare case of cervical epidural abscess caused by MRSA. A 54-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of acute renal failure and hepatitis. He was treated with hemodialysis via the femoral route. His renal function recovered but high fever continued. MRSA was identified from the AV shunt catheter. He noted pain and dysesthesia on his left shoulder one month after admission. He was transferred to our department with suspect of spinal tumor. Neurological examination demonstrated left hemiparesis with superficial sensory disturbance between C8 and Th2. Cervical CT scan showed osteomyelitis at the left C7 lamina and facet. MR imaging disclosed that an epidural mass at C7 had low signal intensity on T1 weighted and high signal intensity on T2 weighted and ring-like enhancement with gadolinium. He was treated conservatively for a month. Sequential MR imaging showed the mass had homogeneous enhancement at C7 epidural space extending to the left intervertebral foramen. Laboratory examination showed normal. The patient was diagnosed as having cervical epidural abscess. A C6 through Th2 laminectomy and C8 foraminotomy were performed and an encapsulated abscess including yellowish pus was totally removed.

The clinical symptoms, which reflected medullary dysfunction in nine children and cervical cord deficits in eight, were present for a mean of 2.1 years before diagnosis (range, 2 months to 7.5 years), and for at least 1 year in 80% of the patients. Neurodiagnostic imaging (MRI in 14, CT in 3) showed the tumor epicenter in the medulla in 11 and in the upper cervical cord in six. Surgery was performed for newly diagnosed tumor in 11 children, and for progressive disease in six who had received prior radiotherapy. The surgical resection was gross total in two and partial (60 to 95%) in fifteen. Fifteen patients had low-grade glial tumors (10 astrocytomas, four gangliogliomas, and one mixed glioma), and two had anaplastic gangliogliomas. Four-year progression-free and total survival rates after surgery for patients who had surgery as initial therapy were 70 and 100%; for those who had surgery at the time of progression, these were 41 and 62%. Postsurgical neurologic complications occurred in five children. Four of these children had received prior radiotherapy. Two of them already had severe preoperative deficits and three had moderate deficits that worsened after surgery. Twelve patients with mild deficits were unchanged or improved postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

An ELISA test was used to analyse serum cytokine (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma) levels in 69 patients with AS. Results were compared with those from 43 patients with RA and 36 patients with non-inflammatory back pain. The relationship between serum concentrations of the different cytokines and parameters of disease activity and severity in AS patients was also evaluated. IL-6 and TNF-alpha serum levels, but not IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma, were significantly higher in AS than in NIBP. However, patients with RA showed higher serum levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma than both AS and NIBP patients. In AS, IL-6 correlated with clinical parameters of disease activity with significant correlation being observed with laboratory parameters of inflammation such as ESR, CRP, platelet count and clinical parameters of severity such as vertebral mobility. TNF-alpha did not correlate with laboratory or clinical parameters of activity. Macrophagic cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6), are increased in AS patients and IL-6 closely correlated with the activity of the disease."

A report of two cases.,"A previously undescribed variant of granular cell tumor with an interesting plexiform pattern was found in the lower leg of a 10-year-old girl and on the back of a 12-year-old girl. Clinically, the patients presented with intradermal plaques that were accompanied by variable degrees of pain or tenderness. Histopathologic examination revealed granular cell tumors with various sized fascicles, particularly around nerve bundles, in a plexiform pattern. Cytoplasmic granules were PAS positive. Immunohistochemical studies showed tumor cells to be strongly positive with S-100 protein and weakly positive with alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and vimentin. These findings offer further support for a neural origin for granular cell tumors."

To determine the course of treatment, an Opioid Escalation Index and Effective Analgesic Score were calculated. The prevalence of pain was almost 90%. Chest and lumbar pain were the most common sites with a clear correlation between site and metastases for the chest. Somatic incident pain did not achieve good pain relief while patients with neuropathic pain did not show any particular disadvantage compared to those exhibiting somatic or visceral pain. Mean Opioid Escalation Index and percentage of pain control observed in lung cancer patients were similar to those recorded in the general cancer population."

CD008686,0,8090267,0,[A case of acute cervical spinal epidural hematoma caused by extradural arterio-venous malformation].,"The authors report a rare case of acute cervical epidural hematoma caused by the hemorrhage from extradural arterio-venous malformation. The patient was a 74-year-old Japanese man with a past history of total gastrectomy after being diagnosed as having gastric cancer 12 years before. Six hours prior to admission, the patient had experienced a sudden episode of severe nuchal pain radiating to both scapular areas, followed by rapid development of left-side Brown-Sequard Syndrome below the C4 cord level, and urinary incontinence. Plain cervical X-ray films did not show any destructive lesion suggesting a metastatic tumor. T1 and T2 weighted images of MRI demonstrated a high intensity mass lesion, suggesting an acute epidural hematoma, extending from C3 to C6 and compressing severely the left side spinal cord posteriorly. Twelve hours after the onset of symptoms, emergency laminectomy from C3 to C6 was performed and a fresh epidural clot with small vascular tissue was totally removed. Histological examination of the small vascular tissue in the hematoma revealed arterio-venous malformation. The postoperative recovery of the patient was dramatic. He regained full muscle strength and there was complete disappearance of sensory deficits 2 weeks after the operation. Although acute spinal epidural hematoma caused by extradural arterio-venous malformation is a rare clinical entity, MRI is the most helpful diagnostic tool for this condition. It should be stressed that accurate neuroradiological diagnosis and prompt surgical decompression of the spinal cord are essential to obtain an excellent surgical outcome."

The office-based workup starts with a careful history aimed at determining the onset, location, and severity of pain. A physical examination includes attention to gait, palpation, and some simple neurologic tests. Most patients require plain x-rays. Bone scans are useful for identifying suspected tumors and infections; CT and MRI are indicated in specific cases. Although the origin of most low back pain is indeterminate, the workup may uncover some important causes in older adults, including lumbar spinal stenosis, osteoporotic vertebral fractures, and metastatic disease to the spine."

CD008686,0,7838581,0,Percutaneous cervical cordotomy and subarachnoid phenol block using fluoroscopy in pain control of costopleural syndrome.,"We examined the efficacy of percutaneous cervical cordotomy (PCC) and subarachnoid phenol block using fluoroscopy (SAPB-F) for control of chest and/or back pain from costopleural syndrome. The efficacy of each block was evaluated by changes in pain score (PS), analgesic dose and performance status 1 week after the block, as well as by the complications. Between 1980 and 1986, PCC was performed in 10 patients. SAPB-F was performed in 13 patients between 1987 and 1991. Pain was not well controlled by analgesics in any of these patients. For PCC the follow-up period was 94.7 +/- 71.1 days. PS (VAS, 0-10) reduced from 8.5 +/- 0.9 to 3.0 +/- 2.7. No analgesics were needed in 4 patients. Pain recurred in 1 patient. Hemiparesis occurred in 2 patients. General fatigue occurred in 6 patients. In 4 patients with these complications performance status deteriorated and did not recover during the follow-up period. For SAPB-F the follow-up period was 71.8 +/- 44.0 days. SAPB-F was designed to achieve selective phenol deposit at the targeted nerve root. PS decreased from 7.5 +/- 1.9 to 2.7 +/- 2.6. No analgesics were needed in 5 patients. Pain recurred in 3 patients. There were no complications and no changes in performance status. From this study we concluded that PCC is an effective method of pain control for costopleural syndrome, but a risk of serious complications is involved. SAPB-F is an effective and safe method and should be the first choice of nociceptive pathway block."
CD008686,0,7801842,0,[A case of malignant pheochromocytoma with high levels of serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and calcitonin].,"A 71-year-old woman was admitted with the chief complaint of headache, lumbago and slight fever. Computerized tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated a large soft tissue mass with multiple cystic necrosis in the right adrenal region. The plasma norepinephrine concentration was excessive and serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), calcitonin and parathormone were elevated. MIBG scintigraphy showed a high uptake in the same region. Under the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma without distant metastasis, right adrenalectomy was performed. The tumor was removed en bloc with right kidney and a part of the liver because of inflammatory adhesion. The histological examination revealed benign pheochromocytoma. After the operation, norepinephrine and calcitonin decreased to normal but the levels of NSE and PTH remained high. One year after operation, chest X-ray revealed multiple lung metastases and after 1.5 years she died of respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed multiple lung and bone metastases and a liver metastasis, parathyroid glands showed hyperplasia but the thyroid gland showed no abnormal change. This clinical course suggests that serum NSE might be a useful tumor marker for differentiating malignant pheochromocytoma from benign one, and this tumor producing calcitonin caused secondary hyperparathyroidism."
CD008686,0,7800400,0,An algorithmic approach to the treatment of Paget's disease of the spine.,"An algorithmic approach to the treatment of Paget's disease of the spine is based on the authors' collective experience in managing 70 patients and a review of the literature. For patients with active disease, even if asymptomatic, cyclical treatment with etidronate is recommended until normalization of biochemical parameters is achieved. For patients with back pain and/or neurologic dysfunction, cyclical etidronate treatment in the blastic and mixed phase is advocated. Those who fail to respond to calcitonin in the lytic phase should be given the new generation of bisphosphonates and gallium nitrate. No antipagetic drug therapy is indicated for the sclerotic phase. Surgery for complications of Paget's disease should be preceded by intravenous therapy to minimize intraoperative bleeding. For cases of spinal stenosis with impending paraplegia, the new bisphosphonates, mithramycin (plicamycin), or gallium nitrate should be used. If conservative treatment fails, surgery should not be delayed."

Computed Tomography failed to reveal the tumour, while showing evidence of disk-degenerative patology and being thus misleading. Similar cases are reported in literature. After a thorough analysis of the causes of such an apparently gross error, it is concluded that the main source of pitfalls arises from neglecting those typical clinical features differentiating prolapsed disk from oncogenetic sciatica. When oncogenetic sciatica is suspected Computed Tomography is inappropriate and even misleading, while the elective investigation is Magnetic Resonance."
CD008686,0,7530113,0,Transplantation of encapsulated bovine chromaffin cells in the sheep subarachnoid space: a preclinical study for the treatment of cancer pain.,"Chromaffin cells have been shown to release a combination of pain-reducing neuroactive compounds including catecholamines and opioid peptides. The allogeneic transplantation of chromaffin cells in the subarachnoid space has been shown to alleviate pain in various rodent models and possibly in terminal cancer patients. Because of the shortage of human cadaver donor tissue, we are investigating the possibility of transplanting xenogeneic cells in polymer capsules. In this technique, cells are surrounded by a permselective synthetic membrane whose pores are suitably sized to allow diffusion of nutrients, neurotransmitters and growth factors, but restrict the diffusion of the large molecules of the immune system and prevent contact with immunocompetent cells. The encapsulation technique therefore allows transplantation of xenogeneic tissue between species as well as retrieval of transplanted cells. Previously we have reported that encapsulated bovine chromaffin cells survive and alleviate pain in various rodent models. The purpose of the present study was to assess the feasibility of implanting a human sized device in a large animal model. Adrenals from 5 calves were surgically removed; chromaffin cells were isolated from these glands using a collagenase-based digestion-filtration technique. Cells were loaded into acrylic-based tubular (5 cm long, 920 microns wide) permselective capsules attached to silicone tethers. The capsules were maintained in vitro for at least 7 days following the encapsulation procedure. Nicotine evoked release was analyzed in a defined subgroup from each batch. One capsule was then implanted using a guiding cannula system in the lumbar subarachnoid space of each sheep for 4 (n = 5) and 8 (n = 1) wk. All capsules were retrieved intact by gentle pulling on the silicone tether. Except for one capsule, the evoked catecholamine release of the retrieved capsules was in the same range as that of other capsules from the same cohort that had been maintained in vitro. All retrieved capsules were devoid of host cell reaction. Clusters of viable cells dispersed in an alginate immobilizing matrix were observed throughout all the implanted capsules. This study demonstrates the feasibility of transplanting functional encapsulated xenogeneic chromaffin cells into the cerebrospinal fluid of a large animal model using a capsule of appropriate dimensions for human implants. We believe that these results suggest the appropriateness of human clinical trials in patients suffering from refractory terminal cancer pain."

Results at the University of California at Los Angeles and review of the literature.,"The authors report 24 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) treated from 1977 to 1992. There were 13 females and 11 males. Median age was 57 (range: 17-84). Patients were symptomatic for a median of 3 months. Headache was the most common complaint. Median Karnofsky performance score was 70. There were 19 patients with solitary PCNSL, and 5 had multiple deposits. Disease was confined to the supratentorium in 23 patients. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology was positive in 5 of 22 patients examined. All patients received whole-brain irradiation with or without supplemental tumor boost. Tumor doses ranged from 10 to 60 Gy. Intrathecal chemotherapy was administered to 16 patients and 7 received systemic agents. After follow-up ranging from 1 to 66 months, median survival and progression-free survival were each 8 months. One- and 3-year actuarial survival rates were 50% and 36%, respectively. One- and 3-year actuarial progression-free rates were 41% and 15%, respectively. Relapse occurred in 18 patients, and in 17 there was a component of local progression. Lesions recurred in the spinal meninges in 1 patients and in the vitreous in 1. Patients with Karnofsky performance status > or = 70 demonstrated median progression-free survival of 27 months, compared to 4 months for patients < 70 (p = .024). No other significant patient or treatment-related prognostic factors were identified. Clinical dementia occurred in 2 of 11 patients surviving at least 1 year. Review of the literature indicates PCNSL demonstrates relative radioresistance. The most immediate improvement in prognosis for patients with PCNSL can be achieved by properly sequencing systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy with radiation therapy."

CD008686,0,7986713,0,Subgroup and cost-benefit analysis of the Finnish multicentre trial of clodronate in multiple myeloma. Finnish Leukaemia Group.,"Osteolytic lesions and pathological fractures are the major problems in the clinical management of multiple myeloma. We previously reported the main results of a randomized, controlled multicentre trial in 350 Finnish patients with multiple myeloma. All patients received standard melphalan-prednisolone treatment and were randomized to receive either clodronate 2.4 g daily or a placebo for 24 months. The proportion of patients with progression of osteolytic bone lesions was twice as high in the placebo group as in the clodronate group (24.0% v 12.0%, P = 0.026). The purpose of the present study was to investigate factors associated with the progression of osteolytic lesions and to identify subgroups of patients who would benefit most from clodronate treatment. In univariate logistic regression analysis, including treatment (placebo, clodronate), sex, age, pain index, serum calcium and creatinine, myeloma stage, number of osteolytic lesions at baseline, and number of vertebral fractures at baseline as independent variables and the progression of osteolytic lesions as a dependent variable, only the treatment with a placebo was associated with the progression of osteolytic bone lesions. Separate analyses with respect to the progression of osteolytic bone lesions were carried out in the following subgroups: male v female, < or = 64 v > 64 years, stage I v stage II-III myeloma, no osteolytic lesions at baseline versus osteolytic lesions at baseline, no vertebral fractures at baseline versus vertebral fractures at baseline. and a 50% treatment response to cytotoxic drugs versus no treatment response to cytotoxic drugs. The treatment with clodronate delayed the progression of osteolytic lesions similarly in these subgroups, with the exception of a subgroup of patients who did not have a 50% treatment response to cytotoxic drugs. The treatment with clodronate did not significantly increase treatment costs. We conclude that the treatment effect of clodronate seems to be independent of sex and age of the patients, the stage of myeloma, and the severity of bone lesions at diagnosis, but not of treatment response to cytotoxic drugs."

Pain was associated with tumour infiltration in 86% of patients and related to therapy in 15%. Even in 6 of 8 patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of ""postthoracotomy syndrome"" and in all 4 patients with ""postradiation syndrome"" local recurrence was diagnosed during follow-up. All 17 cases of brachial plexus lesions were caused by local tumour spread. Symptomatic treatment according to WHO guidelines resulted in good pain relief in 92% of patients and on 82% of days. The incidence of dyspnea decreased from 51% of the patients to 16%. Strong opioids were used on 56% of treatment days. Parenteral or spinal administration of opioids was necessary on 3% of days only."
CD008686,0,7970835,0,Enhancement of opiate analgesia by nimodipine in cancer patients chronically treated with morphine: a preliminary report.,"The ability of nimodipine, a calcium-channel blocker, to enhance morphine analgesia and/or modify the development of tolerance was studied in patients with cancer pain who had needed successive increments of morphine for periods ranging from 21 to 780 days. Assessment of daily morphine consumption was the primary effect parameter. Nimodipine succeeded in reducing the daily dose of morphine in 16 of 23 patients (oral, n = 13; intrathecal, n = 3), and failed to modify it in 2 patients. Total oral daily dose was reduced by nimodipine (120 mg/day) from 282.6 +/- 47.7 mg to 158.7 +/- 26.2 mg (n = 15, P < 0.001). Intrathecal morphine was also reduced by 1-5 mg/day. Nimodipine was withdrawn in 5 patients during the first week of treatment due to intolerance (n = 3) or aggravation of the disease (n = 2). These preliminary results support experimental findings showing that pharmacological interference with Ca(2+)-related events may modify chronic opioid effects, including the expression of tolerance."
CD008686,0,7962453,0,Long-term gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist therapy: the evolving issue of steroidal 'add-back' paradigms.,"The introduction of steroid 'add-back' regimens draws on the recognition that several clinical entities targeted for treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) are not '6-month diseases'. Included under this heading are individuals suffering from symptomatic endometriosis (not desires of pregnancy), uterine fibroids (ineligible or disinterested in definitive surgical therapy), ovarian hyperandrogenism, premenstrual syndrome, menopausal transition, or dysfunctional uterine bleeding. A 6-month course of therapy with a GnRHa does not adversely affect lipoprotein economy and therefore presumably the corresponding cardiovascular risk. A 6-month course of GnRHa therapy appears to be associated with a substantial decrease (of up to 8.2%) in lumbar bone density, a phenomenon which may not be entirely reversible 6 months after discontinuation of therapy. In principle, steroid 'add-back' therapy should diminish some or all of the side-effects associated with GnRHa therapy, may provide a medical treatment option for patients representing a high surgical risk, and may delay surgical intervention if desired. On the other hand, a steroid 'add-back' therapy may delay tissue diagnosis, be associated with a substantial cost as well as with the need for parenteral route of administration. Norethindrone-only (but not medroxyprogesterone acetate-only) 'add-back' regimens have proved promising in the context of endometriosis. Non-concurrent oestrogen/progestin 'add-back' regimens proved promising in the context of uterine fibroids. Substantial additional studies would have to be carried out to validate the utility of steroid 'add-back' regimens. Special emphasis will have to be placed on the evaluation of long-term utility with an eye towards assessing clinical efficacy, impact on lipoprotein economy, impact on bone density, impact on urogenital tissues, and impact on the hot flush. The concurrent or non-concurrent use of non-steroid 'add-back' regimens will also most likely constitute a major component of future studies."

Mean age at presentation was 39 +/- 21 years (range 23-67 years). Patients were followed up for a mean period of 19 months (range 0.5-68 months). Only patients with progressive neurological disease were operated on (3 meningoceles and 16 spinal hamartomas). The remaining patients were treated conservatively and continue to be observed clinically. Two of three patients operated for meningoceles improved without recurrence of symptoms. Patients with spinal hamartomas could be divided into two groups according to their main symptom: paraparesis (group A, n = 8) or pain (group B, n = 11). Malformations in group B were typically associated with a tethered cord and tended to be more complex than in group A. The majority of patients in group A showed better long-term results than patients in group B, due to their considerably lower rate of recurrence."

CD008686,0,7528184,0,Intrathecal morphine in the treatment of chronic intractable pain.,Fifteen patients with intractable pain received intrathecal morphine delivered via a programmable (Medtronic) device. In twelve patients the pain was due to cancer and three patients had pain of non malignant origin. All of the patients reported excellent or good relief. A total of 14 complications were reported in 7 patients. Most of these were minor and related to surgical or mechanical problems. One patient with pain of non malignant origin developed serious complications which required the removal of the infusion device. The results of this study show that chronic intrathecal infusion of morphine is superior to conventional forms of analgesia in patients with intractable pain of malignant origin. We would advise that it should remain a therapy of last resort in patients with intractable non malignant pain as the long term side effects are still unknown and the potential for serious side effects still exists.
CD008686,0,18415440,0,[Intrathecal and epidural administration of non-opioid analgesics in acute and chronic pain treatment.].,"Nociceptive stimuli are modulated at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This modulation is performed by various systems working independently complementarily, additively or supra-additively. Non-opioid analgesics relieve pain without a motor blockade. In contrast to spinal opioids a reduced risk of respiratory depression is expected. In the therapy of chronic pain non-opioid analgesics may be an alternative, given alone or in combination with an opioid. Clinically relevant dosages for antinociception mediated by the alphaadrenoceptoragonistclonidine are >/=150 mug epidurally. Clonidine is effective in reducing acute and chronic pain. In combination with opioids the action of the opioids is intensified. Clonidine intensifies and prolongs the action of local anesthetics. If opioid tolerance occurs, epidural clonidine alone or in combination with an opioid has good antinociceptive action.Midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, was injected spinally for the reduction of pain for various indications (postoperative, malignancy, chronic back pain, spinal spasticity). Spinal benzodiazepine should not be injected into the spine in patients until it has been proven that there are no neurotoxic effects. Intrathecally injectedbaclofen is a well-known means of reducing spinal spasticity. Used in this way, it may have a secondary analgesic effect. No significant direct analgesic effect has so far been demonstrated. Spinalcalcitonin often leads to insufficient pain relief when given alone. Combination with an opioid may reduce the dosage of the opioid. Nausea and vomiting are frequent side effects of spinal calcitonin. Intrathecalsomatostatin produces antinociception. However, in animal studies neurotoxic action has been observed. Administration in man has not yet been proved to be safe. Spinalketamine has procluted controversial results in clinical studies, and has not yet been excluded that the substance is not neurotoxic.Lysine acetylsalicylic acid (L-ASA) has been given intrathecally for the therapy of severe cancer pain and chronic back pain. In most patients good analgesia was observed up to 2 months after a single injection. If neurotoxity can be excluded, L-ASA may be an alternative in the therapy of cancer pain before neurodestructive therapy is done."

It can be misdiagnosed as bony metastases and is a diagnosis of exclusion. We report 12 women, who were treated for endometrial or cervical carcinoma who developed osteitis, femoral head or neck necrosis, or insufficiency fractures of the acetabulum, pubic symphysis or sacroiliac bones after radiotherapy. Many had multiple areas of bone damage. The prescribed external beam dose ranged from 40.0 to 61.2 Gy. All but one patient developed bony discomfort or pain as a symptom. Bony changes of the pelvic girdle appeared between 6 months and 8 years after irradiation. Radiographic studies including plain films, CT or bone scans were performed in these patients and showed correlative changes. Bone scans showed increased radionuclide uptake in affected bones. The subsequent favorable clinical course and outcome with resolution of symptoms confirmed the diagnosis of radiation osteitis. Therapy recommendations are conservative with avoidance of weight-bearing, use of analgesics and physical therapy. Femoral head necrosis/fractures required arthroplasty. Proper shielding, use of multifield technique, treatment of all fields per day, and awareness of tolerance doses are recommended."

Arthroscopy using a unilateral approach and monoportal technique is a valuable adjunct to fluoroscopic monitoring. One hundred patients underwent same-day microsurgical arthroscopic lateral-approach laser-assisted (SMALL) fluoroscopic discectomy. In addition, suspected spinal tumors in three patients were treated by biopsy and infection of the disc space was drained in one. A prototype operating discoscope was employed for delivery of the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser beam to assist with hemostasis. Seventy-five ""ideal"" cases were identified that exhibited the following features: 1) up to a 6-month history of unilateral sciatica symptoms, which responded to bed rest; 2) mechanical signs of nerve root irritation when the patient was erect; 3) computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging studies interpreted as showing one protruding or prolapsed disc without extrusion; 4) no segmental spondylosis at the level of a herniated nucleus pulposus; 5) no motor weakness; 6) no prior disc surgery; 7) no obesity; and 8) no diabetes mellitus. Twenty-five ""nonideal"" cases failed to meet one or more of the above criteria. Good outcome rates were not substantially different in the two groups, success being judged in part by patient satisfaction. Complete success was evidenced in two-thirds of cases by early return to work, but improvement was also determined by increased mobility and a reduction in pain medication from narcotic to analgesic agents. Three patients underwent repeat surgery (laminotomy), but only one improved. Two years has provided sufficient clinical experience to determine that a percutaneous endoscopic procedure under neuroleptanalgesia may become a significant surgical alternative."
CD008686,0,8090548,0,Neurological evaluation after radical resection of sacral neoplasms.,"Eight patients had a radical resection of sacral tumours, and bilateral severance of lumbosacral nerves was required. Their neurological deficits and disturbance of activities of daily living (ADL) were studied. The neurological deficits which occurred were motor dysfunction of the lower limbs, sensory disturbances, and urinary, faecal and sexual dysfunction. Bilateral preservation of the L5 nerve and above was necessary to permit the ability to walk, and bilateral preservation of the S2 nerve and above was necessary to spare urinary, faecal and sexual functions in order to establish ADL. To maintain normal ADL, bilateral preservation of the S2 nerve and above was necessary for walking, and bilateral preservation of the S3 nerve and above was necessary for urinary, faecal and sexual functions."
CD008686,0,8060675,0,The clinical diagnosis of myelopathy.,"Myelopathy is a complex diagnostic problem with many possible causes. Diagnosis rests on recognition of a constellation of symptoms consistent with central nervous system pathology involving trunk, arms, and legs and, in general, sparing the head. Symptoms of cerebral and neuromuscular disease may mimic myelopathy and require brain imaging or electromyography. Pain, most commonly over the site of the lesion, is one of the cardinal complaints of patients with spinal cord disease. Complaints of motor abnormalities caused by myelopathy may include sudden weakness and paralysis, clumsiness, fatigability; sensory complaints such as paresthesias, numbness, deadness, dysesthesias, and bladder symptoms are also characteristic. General examination may point to systemic disease associated with myelopathy. Neurological examination excludes cerebral disease. Motor and sensory examination may define the level of the lesion. Physical examination localizes not only the level of the spinal cord lesion but the anatomic distribution of the lesion within a given level. When tumor or paraspinal infection are diagnostic possibilities, emergent imaging of the spine is required."
CD008686,0,8048017,0,[Backache--what to remember?].,"This review tries to help the general physician to discriminate between extravertebral and vertebral causes of back pain by medical history and clinical investigation. The extravertebral causes are most often related to psychobiosocial disturbances, less often to muscular overload, viscerogenous or neurogenous causes. The vertebral causes, on the other side, are often related to functional disturbances of intervertebral joints or degenerative disorders or, in rarer instances, to metabolic, inflammatory, tumourous, or developmental disorders of the spine."
CD008686,0,8042492,0,Sacral and non-spinal tumors presenting as backache. A retrospective study of 17 patients.,"Among 1302 cases reported to our tumor registry, 78 presented with backache as primary symptom. 17 of these had non-spinal tumors, 7 pelvic, 6 sacral, 3 femoral, and 1 costal. There were long delays in making the correct diagnosis; some patients even had had spinal surgery. The mistakes were the classic ones: poor history, poor physical examination, poor radiological work-up. Analysis of these 17 cases suggests that standard spinal radiographs should include an AP pelvis film and a lateral sacral projection. Patients with persistent radiating pain and normal radiographs should have a Tc-99 scan. The correct diagnosis would have been made in all the cases if this protocol had been followed."
CD008686,0,7919877,0,[Value of magnetic resonance tomography in diagnosis of tethered cord syndrome in children].,"The tethered cord syndrome is considered a trouble complex that is caused by fixation of the spinal cord by intra- or extradural components. Clinically it is characterized by motor and sensory dysfunction of the lower extremities, muscle atrophy, decreased or hyperactive reflexes, urinary and bowel incontinence, spastic gait, or orthopedic deformities. Traditionally, positive-contrast myelography has been the diagnostic procedure of choice, often supported by CT (post myelo-CT). With the improvement of surface-coil technology, MR imaging has become a useful diagnostic tool for the assessment of the spinal cord and canal without ionizing radiation. MR examinations of 80 patients with the clinical diagnosis of tethered spinal cord were reviewed retrospectively in order to define normal anatomy and pathological findings as well as to establish MR strategies in the diagnosis of tethered cord syndrome in children. In order to evaluate intraspinal lipomas, the width of the spinal canal and dysraphic lesions, T1-weighed sagittal and transverse images are useful. In case of deformities of the spinal column the corona slice orientation should be used. The filum terminale and its thickness is best seen in T2-weighed transverse and sagittal images. The extension of fat within the spinal canal over more then 6 vertebral bodies and more then 1.2 cm width could be an indication of a lipomatous malformation in the sacral spinal canal."

CD008686,0,7522143,0,[Pain therapy of tumor patients with special reference to tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. WHO staged schedule versus para-spinal analgesia techniques].,"In this study we compared 293 patients with cancer pain undergoing treatment in the years 1987 until 1993. 165 patients (55.7%) suffering from cancer localized at the organs of gastrointestinal tract. Comparing the therapeutic results of WHO pattern with patients after implantation of port systems with epidural or intrathecal catheters and portable external morphine pumps we found at port-patients a significant lower number of side effects like nausea, vomiting, obstipation and weariness. Furthermore we noted at port-patients lower values of pain score (VAS). We think the high incidence of uncomfortable side effects of drugs at patients with gastrointestinal cancer may be caused by the type of special illness. Therefore we discuss the possibility of an earlier use of the method of port implantation at special indications."
CD008686,0,8060813,0,Individual differences in pediatric cancer patients' reactions to invasive medical procedures: a repeated measures analysis.,"Previous research on child distress in pediatric cancer has addressed the issue of habituation to invasive procedures using correlational methodology. In addition, most studies have focused on the bone marrow aspiration (BMA); few have examined children's reactions to the lumbar puncture (LP) separately. The present investigation examined 13 pediatric cancer patients over time as they experienced five BMAs or LPs. Direct observation of child behavior during procedures was employed to assess distress responses using a 12-category measure. Individual patients demonstrated a range of distress patterns. Only two children were observed to habituate to these procedures. The importance of individual patient characteristics and differences in the execution of the procedures are discussed, as is the need for greater use of treatments for child distress."
CD008686,0,8009412,0,Spinal intramedullary cavernous angiomas: a literature meta-analysis.,"The present report reviews 57 (out of 65) cases of spinal intramedullary cavernomas collected from the literature, plus one personal patient. Almost 70% of all patients were women. Mean age at diagnosis for women was 36.4 years, with a peak in the third decade. More than three-fourths of all women became symptomatic between the second and fourth decades, with a peak in the fourth decade. Unlike in men, cervical and thoracic lesions are almost equally represented, generally involving 1-2 vertebral levels. Mean size at diagnosis is 1.7 cm; no enlargement over time was seen. Symptoms are more frequently acute; pain and sensorimotor deficits are the usual complaints, but the clinical picture may simulate that of multiple sclerosis. The duration of history was less than 5 years in more than 80% of women. Bleeding was seen in 60% of women, with a risk of 1.6%/person-year of exposure globally. Cervical lesions have both a shorter course and increased frequency of bleeding. If not immediately recognized, repeated cycles of bleeding are the norm, with a mean interval of 39.6 months between the first and second episodes. The preoperative status was the single most important factor bearing on outcome, whereas sex, age, size, location, duration of history and extent of removal were not. Magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic in all cases, whereas angiography was 100% negative. Surgery should not be a necessary first option, as recovery from the first bleeding is apparently fairly frequent."
CD008686,0,7517464,0,[Time-resolved-fluoroimmunoassay for the determination of prostate-specific-antigen in capillary-blood spotted on filter paper and its clinical significance in prostate cancer patients].,"Prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) has recently become widely recognized as an important tumor marker for prostate cancer. For relieving the examinee from pain and saving the time in blood collection, we developed a new method, based on time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA), using a dried disc paper to collect capillary-blood. The standard curve ranged from 1.0 to 300 ng/ml, the intraassay (CV% was 4.09 to 6.36 (n = 10), while the interassay CV% was 3.45 to 8.87 (n = 2, k = 7). The diluted linearity and analytical recovery (91.5 to 98.2%) seemed to be satisfactory for routine use. All the samples from 30 healthy male adults had non-detectable serum PSA less than 1.0 ng/ml. When the cut-off value was set at 3.4 ng/ml (MEAN + SD of BPH), the positive rate in prostate cancer cases was 85.7% (12/14), in BPH cases was 20.0% (2/10) and in other benign urological disease was 0.0% (0/20). The clinical sensitivity was 85.7%, the specificity 93.3% and the efficacy 90.9%, accordingly. In conclusion, the newly developed TR-FIA method using dried disc paper to collect capillary-blood was quantitatively suitable as a routine test for prostate cancer, because of its simplicity in blood collection and less invasiveness to the examinee."

CD008686,0,7956519,0,Mucous cysts of the external popliteal sciatic nerve during childhood: presentation of two cases and a review of the literature.,"Mucous cysts of the peroneal head constitute the most frequent cause of compression of the external popliteal sciatic nerve (EPS). Depending on the site in which it occurs, we distinguish between intranervous cysts, which are very rare, and extranervous ones, which are more frequent. The two varieties, which constitute anatomical variants of the same lesion and, probably, of a metaplasia of the connective tissue, are, from an anatomical point of view, true cysts, with their own connective walls, endothelial covering, and mucoid contents. Clinically, there is pain, paresthesia, a palpable mass, and motor deficit, all occurring at an early stage of the disease, depending on its site and size. At times, when there is no palpable mass, there may be problems with differential diagnosis with regard to disc compression. Ultrasound examination, electromyography, and, above all, MRI, have all proven to be useful in the study of the features of the neoformation; nonetheless, in our experience, they were not able to reveal either intra- or extranervous localization."
CD008686,0,7951953,0,Ankle arthroplasty by excision of the talar body: subtotal talectomy.,"We carried out the ankle arthroplasty by excision of the talar body (subtotal talectomy) on 10 ankles of nine patients with talar body tumor, paralytic talipes equinovarus, talipes varus due to spinal injury, or comminuted fracture of the talar body. Talar body excision was initiated by lateral incision and subsequent osteotomy of the fibula. The fibula was everted, leaving the lateral ligament (calcaneofibular ligament) intact. After the talus was exposed, the talar body was excised, leaving about 1.5 cm of head unresected. Subsequently, the fibula was shortened slightly, and the tibia was pulled down to the level of the calcaneus to form a joint, instead of arthrodesis being performed. After surgery, the joint formed by the tibia and calcaneus was mobile in seven of the 10 feet and immobile (arthrodesis) in the remaining three feet. The average follow-up period was 6 years. Although postoperative x-ray revealed slight osteoarthritic changes of Chopart's joint and the tibiocalcaneal joint, none of the patients showed ankle pain that impaired activities of daily living. Subtotal talectomy allows correction of talipes equinus without Achilles tendon lengthening."
CD008686,0,7514479,0,Effects on movement of surgical incisions into the human spinal cord.,"In 44 patients having cordotomies for relief of the pain of cancer, a correlation was made between the location and extent of the incision in the spinal cord and the motor state. Post-mortem histological examination of the spinal cord was carried out in all areas. An incision cutting through one anterior quadrant of the cord at any segmental level could be made without causing any disturbance of motility. An incision in the thoracic segments cutting through the anterior half of the cord could be made without causing any disturbance of motility. This fact implies that tracts in the posterior half of the cord can supply the input from the brain necessary for the maintenance of functions normally mediated by tracts in the anterior half of the cord. The more posterior the incision reached in the posterolateral column, the greater were the defects in motility. A large unilateral lesion dividing most of the lateral corticospinal tract, and the descending fibres anterior to it, caused flaccid paralysis of the ipsilateral lower limb. Voluntary movements started to return within 5 h. An incision in the thoracic cord cutting through one lateral corticospinal tract and 85-90% of the opposite tract and reticulospinal fibres anterior to that tract caused total paralysis of the lower limbs. Recovery ensued over 2 months so that the patient eventually walked, though with severe spastic paraparesis. Recovery of some flexor and extensor movements of the ipsilateral fingers and toes occurred within 6 h of an incision being made in the upper cervical cord that divided the lateral corticospinal tract unilaterally. Division of only the anterior fibres of the lateral corticospinal tract above the cervical enlargement did not affect the motility of the ipsilateral upper limb. It is concluded that in the more cranial segments of the spinal cord, corticospinal fibres destined for the upper limb are in the more posterior part of the tract. Correlation of the clinical with the histological evidence of a lesion of the lateral corticospinal tract was carried out. When it was deduced on the clinical evidence that the tract was damaged, this was always found to be correct. On the other hand, the tract might show histological evidence of damage without manifesting any evidence of a lesion. The Babinski response was found, in general, to occur with lesions of the lateral corticospinal tract and not with lesions elsewhere in the cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD008686,0,8190231,0,Melanoma arising in a cervical spinal nerve root: report of a case with a benign course and malignant features.,"A 20-year-old caucasian woman with a 5-year history of right arm, neck, and back pain sought treatment when an automobile accident (4 months before admission) exacerbated her pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intra- and extradural mass compressing the spinal cord at the C5-C6 level. It also extended into and widened the neural foramen, mimicking a neurofibroma. A single cafe-au-lait spot was discovered in the inguinal region. A two-staged surgical resection was performed on an apparent hemorrhagic C6 nerve root mass. The mass exhibited diagnostic features of a malignant melanoma histologically, immunocytochemically, and ultrastructurally. A search for a primary lesion outside the nervous system or other metastases during an 8-year period from the onset of symptoms has been negative. The patient's chronic history, evidence of neural foraminal enlargement, and the absence of other malignant melanoma lesions or subsequent metastases indicates that this lesion may be a primary melanoma of the nerve root with a benign course."
CD008686,0,8129590,0,Cervical radiculopathy.,"The history, pathoanatomy and pathophysiology, clinical picture, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of cervical radiculopathy are reviewed. The review is based on a 10-year Medline literature search, review of bibliographies in textbooks, and bibliographies in articles obtained through the search. Cervical radiculopathy, although recognized early in the 20th century, was first associated with disc pathology in the mid-1930s. It is most commonly caused by disc herniation or cervical spondylosis. History and physical examination using pain location, manual muscle testing, and specialized testing (Spurling's maneuver) will usually suffice to diagnose the radiculopathy and determine the root level involved. Diagnostic imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or myelography should be used as presurgical evaluative tools or when tumor or other etiology besides disc herniation or spondylosis is suspected. Electromyography is of benefit in distinguishing various entities that clinically present similar to cervical radiculopathy and can also help to ""date"" the lesion. Treatment of this disorder has not been systematically studied in a controlled fashion. However, using a variety of different treatments, the radiculopathy usually improves without the need for surgery. Indications for surgery are unremitting pain despite a full trial of non-surgical management, progressive weakness, or new or progressive cervical myelopathy. Prospective studies evaluating the various treatment options would be of great benefit in guiding practitioners toward optimum cost-effective evaluation and care of the patient with cervical radiculopathy."
CD008686,0,8080224,0,Spinal neurolysis for cancer pain: indications and recent results.,"Effective control of cancer pain can now be achieved in a high proportion of patients with rigorously applied pharmacologic treatment, reducing the need for more demanding invasive procedures. Ten to thirty percent of patients will, however, require some form of more aggressive management, ranging from the parenteral and spinal administration of opioids to neurodestructive procedures. Intrathecal neurolysis is a time-tested procedure that, although used less frequently than in the past, still has important indications. Guidelines for patient selection and results of a recent clinical series are presented here."
CD008686,0,8009430,0,Disk edema and peripheral neuropathy.,"A 55-year-old woman presented with an eight-year history of progressive gait dysfunction and a 2-3 week history of horizontal diplopia. Examination of the patient revealed acute papilledema, intermittent esotropia, and upper and lower motor neuron findings in her lower extremities. CT scan of the head showed communicating hydrocephalus. A spinal cord tumor extending from T11 to L3 was visualized by MR imaging of the spine. All of her symptoms, except for a left foot drop, resolved with aggressive removal of the tumor, which was a myxopapillary ependymoma. Mechanisms of the neuro-ophthalmic picture and treatment of this syndrome are discussed."
CD008686,0,7926892,0,Delayed diagnosis of spinal vascular malformations presenting as intermittent myelopathy.,"We report our recent experience of three male patients, whose clinical diagnosis and subsequent surgery was delayed for 9.25 and 15 months respectively. Initially, they all presented with vague, either sensory or motor lower limb disturbances and intermittency of symptoms was followed by bladder dysfunction or impotence. Extensive laboratory work-up was unrevealing and the non-specific diagnosis of myelopathy further delayed the recognition of the underlying vascular lesion. Finally spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), supine myelography and selective spinal arteriography indicated the presence of a tumor in the first patient and vascular malformation in the other two. Neurosurgery and histology confirmed one cavernous angioma and two arteriovenous malformations, all thoracic and dural. We believe that both the cryptic nature of these lesions and our technical limitations (spinal arteriography and MRI not readily available), accounted for the delayed diagnosis in our three patients, who nevertheless, when treated by surgery showed a satisfactory outcome in the first case, while further deterioration was prevented in the other two."
CD008686,0,8198671,0,Neurologic features as initial presentations of childhood malignancies.,"Thirty patients were examined initially because of neurologic problems and later were diagnosed as having systemic malignant disorders. Acute leukemia was the most common malignancy (36.6%), followed by neuroblastoma (33.3%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (13.3%), rhabdomyosarcoma (10%), Ewing tumor (3.3%), and Hodgkin lymphoma (3.3%). Four of the 11 acute leukemia patients had nervous system involvement due to meningeal, orbital, or cerebellar infiltration. The complaints of the remaining patients included back pain, weakness, and difficulty in walking, all of which were caused by anemia or bone pain. Neurologic involvement in systemic malignancies, other than acute leukemia, mainly appeared as spinal cord compression (7 with neuroblastoma, 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma, 1 Ewing tumor), orbital or cavernous sinus infiltration (3 with acute leukemia, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma), and VIIth cranial nerve involvement (2 with rhabdomyosarcoma). One patient had skull infiltration without any neurologic deficit. Cerebellar signs were caused by the remote effects of cancer. It is concluded that acute leukemia is the first and neuroblastoma is the second most common malignancy among childhood systemic malignancies presenting with neurologic involvement; however, neuroblastoma is the most common cause of spinal cord compression."

One hundred thirty-nine out of 1018 (13.6%) underwent technetium-99m planar bone scanning as part of their investigation. Seventy-three out of 139 scans (52%) showed increased uptake in some area, but only 27 out of 139 (19.4%) showed increased uptake specifically in the low back. Scans consistently yielded no findings with reference to the back when the prescan diagnosis was spinal stenosis, lumbar pain syndrome, herniated nucleus pulposus, or postlaminectomy syndrome. Some scans gave positive findings in patients with a diagnosis of degenerative disc disease, pseudarthrosis, spondylolisthesis, fracture, infection, metabolic disorder, or tumor. Positive scans were generally obtained early after presentation (within 3 months) and negative scans obtained later (after 6 months), suggesting that clinical suspicion is still the main indication for early scanning. Planar bone scanning was helpful in both diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making in many conditions."

A 16-year-old girl was seen with sudden onset of interscapular pain and paraplegia from fatal ischemic transverse myelopathy due to arterial and venous occlusions by fibrocartilaginous embolism. In 32 cases of nucleus pulposus embolism, females predominated (69%) and age distribution was bimodal with peaks at 22 and 60 years (median, 38.5). Embolization was either arterial and venous (50%) or purely arterial (50%). Myelopathy predominated in cervical (69%) and lumbosacral (22%) segments. Schmorl's nodes, larger volume and vascularization of nucleus pulposus in the young, and spinal arteriovenous communications, trauma, and degenerative changes in older patients could be important pathogenetic factors. Diagnosis requires histopathologic confirmation. Nucleus pulposus embolism may be an underlying cause in cases diagnosed as transverse myelitis and ischemic infarction of spinal cord."

Seventy-five were Mayo Clinic cases and 231 were from consultation files. Males outnumbered females two to one. The age range was 6 months to 75 years (mean age, 20.4 years). The vertebral column including the sacrum was the most frequent site (32%). Pain was the usual complaint and neurologic findings were associated with vertebral tumors. Although most tumors were well circumscribed, cortical expansion and destruction were common radiographic findings (39%), and 12% had features suggestive of malignancy. Large, epithelioid osteoblasts were seen in 24% and were the predominant cellular element in 10%. A distinctive epithelioid multifocal pattern was recognized. Recurrence rates were 16% (Mayo Clinic cases) and 21% (consultation cases). Tumors involving the central neuraxis were associated with greater morbidity and mortality. Aggressive behavior is within the biologic spectrum of osteoblastomas, and histopathology alone does not appear to be a reliable predictor of aggressiveness. The most important differential diagnosis is osteosarcoma."

The clinical symptoms are variable, including headache, occipitocervical pain, and hoarseness. Neurological symptoms are present only in 40% of cases. The age group ranges from 4 to 56 years. A number of patients are misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, syringomyelia, and cervical disc disease. The overall incidence of these tumors vary from 1.6 to 2.4%. The majority of meningiomas are histologically benign. Papillary (malignant) meningiomas are even rarer in this location. The present report is that of a 46-year-old man who developed a painless mass in the nape of his neck, without any neurological symptoms. Following initial biopsy at another hospital, a definitive resection was undertaken at Loyola University Medical Center. The diagnosis of a malignant meningioma was made after extensive immunohistochemical and electron microscopic studies.

CD008686,0,8287751,0,Radical abdominopelvic lymphadenectomy: historic perspective and current role in the surgical management of rectal cancer.,"Radical abdominopelvic lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer is based on the tenet that removal of all potentially involved lymphatic tissue will yield a lower rate of locoregional failure and improve survival. At centers with extensive experience with the procedure, the operating time is only modestly prolonged compared with conventional resection. Blood loss and postoperative hospitalization are not significantly increased. Urinary dysfunction and impotence associated with radical abdominopelvic lymphadenectomy (as high as 80 percent and 76 percent, respectively, in recent series) have been major deterrents to its more routine application. Preservation of the hypogastric plexus and even selective preservation of a unilateral S4 nerve root have been shown to reduce the occurrence of genitourinary complications. Improved five-year survival of 68 percent and local recurrence rates of 5 to 20 percent for TNM Stage III cancers have been achieved with radical abdominopelvic lymphadenectomy. These results compare favorably with recent trials of adjuvant chemoradiation after conventional resection in stage-matched patients. The rationale, evolution, and application of radical abdominopelvic lymphadenectomy to the surgical management of rectal cancer are critically examined. The potential benefits of radical abdominopelvic lymphadenectomy, which have been demonstrated in nonrandomized trials, should be evaluated in a prospective and properly randomized study to clearly establish or refute its efficacy."

Radicular pain was predominant in patients with metastases located in the lumbar area, while the severity of motor symptoms was positively correlated with thoracic metastases. The most common initial symptom was radicular pain, followed, with decreasing frequency, by motor weakness, sensory complaints and bladder dysfunction. The progression of motor weakness influenced the probability of establishing the diagnosis of spinal cord compression by stepwise marked increased probability when patients lost gait function or progressed into total paralysis."
CD008686,0,8192765,0,[A 75-year-old man with parkinsonism and delirium].,"We report a 75-year-old man with a ten-year history of parkinsonism, who developed acute delirium. He was well until 65 years of age, when there was an onset of tremor in his left hand. He had been treated with levodopa and trihexyphenidyl with marked improvement. He was doing well until July of 1991 at his age of 75-year-old, when he noted backache; he was found to have a compression fracture of the third lumbar spine. He had to use a wheel-chair most of the time since then. In December 1991, he started to have visual hallucinations and difficulty in swallowing. On December 25 of that year, he developed fever and delirium, and was admitted to our hospital on December 30. On admission, general physical examination was unremarkable except for low grade fever (37.3 degrees C). Neurologic examination revealed an alert but chronically ill patient. Apparently he had visual hallucinations. He was disoriented to all spheres; he could respond only to simple questions. Apparently he was demented. Cranial nerves were intact except for mumbling speech disturbance and masked face. He was unable to stand or walk. He had flexion contracture in his both knee joints.

CD008686,0,8161462,0,[The tethered cord syndrome : a review of causes].,"We present eighteen cases with Tethered cord syndrome (TCS). They were eleven adults and eight children. There were eight cases with surgical interventions performed in other centers during the newborn period for different types of spinal disraphisms. Clinical onset was insidious in 88% of the cases, and in 12% of the cases was acute, due to a precipitating factor. The main clinical findings were neurological skeletal , urological and cutaneous alterations in variable frequencies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the best diagnostic test. Urodynamic studies in patients with urological alterations were abnormal and they helped to establish additional pharmacological treatment. After surgery 88% of the patients had an improvement or an arrest in the progression of the symptoms. Patients with shorter duration of the symptoms (less than 2 years) had a better prognosis."
CD008686,0,8156261,0,A pilot study to assess the efficacy of salmon calcitonin in the relief of neuropathic pain caused by extraskeletal metastases.,"Although the pain-relieving activity of salmon calcitonin has been mainly demonstrated for painful bone metastases it has been postulated that the drug possesses a central analgesic activity which is independent of the opiate receptor system. Thus, 16 patients with neuropathic cancer pain due to radicular compression by extraskeletal metastases, and without the possibility of any specific anticancer treatment, entered the study. Of the 16, 11 were pretreated with opiate-type analgesics. Salmon calcitonin was applied once daily at a dose of 200 IU in 500 ml 0.9% NaCl infused over 1 h. The total duration of the treatment was 20 days. The pain-relieving effect was classified as very good, good, moderate and bad; in 10 patients it was described as bad, in 2 as moderate in 2 as good and in 2 as very good. The drug failed in 9/11 opiate-pretreated patients. It is suggested that salmon calcitonin pain-relieving activity might depend on the tumor type, previous pain-relieving drug intake and site of metastatic disease."
CD008686,0,8142278,0,The surgical and natural morbidity of aggressive resection for posterior fossa tumors in childhood.,"The morbidity associated with gross total removal of pediatric posterior fossa tumors is well recognized although it is rarely isolated from other factors that comprise the management morbidity for these tumors. This study reviews (1) the operative and postoperative complications in 105 patients and (2) the neurological morbidity in a subset of 91 patients undergoing gross total removal of their tumor between 1982 and 1992. Gross total removal was achieved in 102 patients with a single procedure. Two patients with residual tumor underwent early repeat craniotomy for excision and 1 is being followed without repeat resection. Intra- and postoperative complications occurred in 33 patients and included hematoma requiring craniotomy (3), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (2), hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement (9), wound problems (4), and pseudomeningocele formation requiring additional treatment (5). Delayed onset hydrocephalus requiring shunting occurred in 2 patients and spinal deformity in 4 patients. Worsening of preoperative deficit (new cranial nerve palsies, worsening ataxia, bulbar dysfunction including apnea, mutism and seizures) occurred in 41% of patients operated on for primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) (14/34), 53% of ependymomas (10/19), and 30% of astrocytomas (15/50). No patient who had a choroid plexus tumor was worsened by the procedure. Complete recovery of new postoperative deficits occurred in 14% of PNET (2/14), 50% of ependymoma (5/10) and 47% of astrocytoma (7/15), most often within 6 months of the procedure. Residual neurological morbidity, due to persistence of preoperative symptoms or due to deficits that occurred as the result of the surgical procedure, was assessed in a subgroup of 91 patients followed for an average of 48 months (2-147 months). This assessment did not include morbidity due to adjuvant therapy. Sixty-two percent of patients continued to exhibit abnormal cerebellar or bulbar signs. Forty-three percent of the total population exhibited limitation in function due to residual deficit. Only 38% of patients were both functionally normal and had a normal neurological examination at last follow-up."

CD008686,0,8076483,0,Low back pain in tumors: diagnosis and treatment.,"On the basis of the authors' experience in the treatment of 257 skeletal neoplasms of the lumbar spine, the features of back pain, which in 96% of the cases constitutes the first symptom of these diseases, are discussed. The overall clinical aspects firstly depend on the stage of the primary tumor: latent, active, aggressive for benign tumors; intra- and extra-compartmental for malignant tumors. Symptoms may include elements which suggest specific lesions, such as osteoid osteoma, eosinophilic granuloma, aneurysmal bone cyst, or high-grade malignant tumors such as Ewing's sarcoma, while lumbar metastasis from carcinoma do not seem to have distinctive features. Site and localization of the tumor are also important variables. The treatment of neoplastic back pain depends on diagnosis, and cannot be adequate if it is not planned on the basis of a complete preoperative study, taking into account not only surgery, but also adjuvant therapy."
CD008686,0,8035250,0,Pain control with morphine for vertebral metastases and sciatica in advanced cancer patients.,"Morphine was administered to 56 advanced cancer patients; of that number spinal metastases had induced bone pain in 28 and malignant tumors had induced sciatica in 28. The sciatica was caused in 16 patients by direct invasion of the sacral plexus, in four by lumbar bone metastases, and in eight by pelvic bone metastases. Spinal bone pain was controlled adequately with morphine. However, sciatica required larger dosages of morphine than did bone pain. Among the group with sciatica, rectal cancer patients needed larger dosages of morphine than the other cancer patients. Even with high doses of morphine, it was occasionally difficult to control neuropathic pain of the sciatic nerve caused by intrapelvic cancer."
CD008686,0,8000396,0,[Value of vertebroplasty combined with surgical decompression in the treatment of aggressive spinal angioma. Apropos of 3 cases].,"Vertebral hemangiomas can cause difficult-to-treat neurological complications. We report our experience with three such cases. Patients no. 1 and 2 were females aged 64 and 71 years, respectively; patient no. 1 had a two-year history of weakness in the lower limbs and patient no. 2 had a five-month history of back pain. Both these patients had a pyramidal syndrome in the lower limbs. Patient no. 3 was a 61 year old male with a one-year history of left sciatica. Roentgenograms were suggestive of a hemangioma occupying the entire T8 (cases 1 and 2) or L5 (case 3) vertebra. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed this diagnosis and showed that patients 1 and 2 had an anterior epidural hemangioma opposite T8 impinging on the spinal cord. In patients 1 and 2, treatment consisted in embolization of T8 followed by transpedicular injection of 6 cc of methylmethacrylate into the body of T8. One cubic centimeter of histoacryl was also injected in each lamina. The third patient had a similar vertebroplasty procedure without prior embolization since he had no epidural hemangioma. One patient (no. 1) developed intercostal neuralgia of several hours duration after the procedure. All three patients subsequently underwent laminectomy (T7-T8 with removal of the epidural hemangioma in cases 1 and 2, L5 in case 3). The pyramidal syndrome resolved within 15 days in patients 1 and 2; the nerve root pain resolved within 48 hours in patient 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,7969675,0,Free-hand ultrasound-guided renal biopsy: report of 650 consecutive cases.,"In the past 4 years we have carried out 650 percutaneous renal biopsies (PRB), 54 on transplanted and 596 on native kidneys. PRB was performed with a 14-gauge one-piece disposable needle that was introduced free-handedly into the lumbar wall without any form of fixed guidance or support. Ultrasound was used to locate the kidney pole and to follow the progression of the needle tip in the renal parenchyma. The time needed for the whole procedure was about 5 min. The tissue specimen was adequate for histological evaluation in 98.8% of the cases. The prevalence of post-biopsy complications (haematuria, pain, anaemia) was 2.5%. Haematuria was not a common complication (1.6%) in our series, whereas clinically silent perirenal haematoma was common. Mild perirenal bleeding (volume < 5 ml) was found in 40 of a series of 150 patients (26.6%) who underwent ultrasound scan 24 h after the PRB. Haematoma exceeding 100 ml was revealed with US in only 0.6% of the patients. We conclude that free-hand ultrasound-guided PRB makes this technique easier, highly successful, time-saving and almost free of severe side effects."
CD008686,0,7942203,0,Neurinomas of the cauda equina clinical analysis of 40 surgical cases.,"We report a retrospective study conducted on 40 patients with neurinoma of the cauda equina, assessing the clinical features and treatment. Neurinomas are clinically indistinguishable from other tumours localized in the same region. It is possible, but not simple, to differentiate neurinoma of the cauda equina from more common lumbar disc herniations. In the early stage, neurinomas provoke sciatic pain that is unilateral and monoradicular, worsened in decubitus and hard to define, whereas in the later stage pain becomes bilateral, polyradicular and is mostly accompanied by motor and sensory disturbances. Moreover, Lasegue's sign was often absent. Therapeutically, total removal of the tumour seems to be the most appropriate form of treatment given that even the sacrifice of a root does not worsen any pre-existing neurological deficit."
CD008686,0,7861192,0,Paraneoplastic sensorimotor neuropathy associated with breast cancer.,"Paraneoplastic sensorimotor neuropathy occurs in association with many different types of cancer. The clinical findings are heterogeneous, and the pathogenesis is unknown. We have encountered 9 women with breast cancer and shared neurological features that suggest a distinct paraneoplastic syndrome. The syndrome is characterized by upper and lower extremity paresthesias and numbness, itching, muscle weakness and cramps, and in some, radicular symptoms and signs. Serum and CSF inflammatory changes suggested an immune pathogenesis but none had detectable antibodies directed at nervous system elements. Six patients presented with neuropathy 2 months to 8 years before the discovery of the breast cancer. In 7 the neoplastic disease was localized to the breast and axillary lymph nodes. The neurologic course was chronic in all, and while symptoms were annoying, disability was minimal until late. One improved transiently with plasmapheresis, and three had mild transient improvement with treatment of the cancer. Recognition of this paraneoplastic syndrome may forewarn the physician of an underlying breast malignancy."

The initial manifestation is often a Brown-Sequard's syndrome progressing to complete and permanent myelopathy, with notable absence of localized or radicular pain. The parenchymal change of the spinal cord in radiation myelopathy can be easily visualized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) however there may be cases in which MRI appearance alone does not distinguish specially between tumor and radiation necrosis with absolute confidence: therefore, DPRM is by necessity a diagnosis of exclusion, based on clinical, paraclinical results and course of disease. Corticosteroid therapy is accompanied by a significant remission of symptoms. The evolution is characterized by a worse prognosis, prevention is absolutely necessary based on perfect radiation technic, knowledge on tolerance of spinal cord to irradiation (time-dose-volume factors) and other risks factors (chemotherapy, age and vascular disease)."

Part 2: Surgery of malignant tumourous disease.,"In this retrospective study, the results of surgery were examined in 25 patients, 65 years of age or older, suffering from malignant tumour growth along the cervical spine. The group consisted of 17 men and 8 women. The mean age was 73 years, ranging from 66 to 88 years. The pathology identified was metastasis in 23 patients, and plasmocytoma in two. The tumour localization involved a single segment of the cervical spine in 12 patients, two segments in 8 patients, three segments in 4 patients, and four segments in one patient. Pre-operatively, 8 patients (32%) suffered solely from severe pain. 6 patients (24%) showed severe pain and radicular nerve compression. 5 patients (20%) had incomplete para- or tetraparesis but were able to walk, and again 6 patients (24%) had incomplete para- or tetraparesis, and were unable to walk. A multitude of accompanying systemic diseases was present in the majority of patients. Evaluation of the peri-operative risk profile was performed using the American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) Grading of Physical Status Score. Operation consisted of microsurgical tumour removal, usually incorporating a single- or multi-level vertebrectomy, with radical epidural decompression, and grafting with bone cement followed by an appropriate osteosynthesis. Of the whole cohort of patients treated, four patients were still alive at the time of the last follow-up evaluation. 21 patients died. Four patients died within seven days after surgery. The remaining 17 patients died during the follow-up period. All of these patients died from systemic spread of their primary cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,7725943,0,Frontotemporal epidural approach to trigeminal neurinomas.,"From 1980 through 1993 a series of 44 patients with trigeminal neurinomas was treated. Five of them were operated on for the remainder of the tumour as they had undergone previous surgery elsewhere, 35 were operated on for the first time, and 4 were not operated on for various reasons. An epidural approach to the neurinomas originating in the branches of the Vth nerve peripherally to the Gasserian ganglion (GG) was used. In the neurinomas originating in the GG or in the root of the Vth nerve, either an epidural-transdural approach or an epidural-transdural-transpetrous approach was used. All tumours operated on using the approach described in this article were completely removed. In 10 patients, the Vth nerve sensory deficits increased in comparison with preoperative deficits; in 9 their state remained unaltered; and in 11 the sensory function of the Vth nerve improved. In those patients who had experienced pre-operative atypical trigeminal pain, the pain disappeared after surgery. There was no additional treatment: radiosurgery, irradiation or chemotherapy. Histopathological examination did not reveal any malignant changes in the tumours in any of the patients. Based on our own experience and on the published data it is believed that the best treatment for trigeminal neurinomas is complete microsurgical removal of the lesion."
CD008686,0,7668426,0,[Spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma: a rare cause of hemorrhagic shock].,"A spontaneous retroperitoneal haematoma is an uncommon cause of haemorrhagic shock. We report a case of spontaneous rupture of a renal angiomyolipoma resulting in haemorrhagic shock in a 52-year-old woman. The renal tumor was recognized by sonography and diagnosed by CT-scan. Renal angiography was performed, but embolization was not successful. During the surgical procedure, nephrectomy was required because of persistent bleeding, related to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Outcome was uneventful. Diagnosis and treatment of renal angiomyolipoma are discussed. The Lenk's triad, consisting of acute lumbar pain, symptoms of internal bleeding and lumbar tumefaction, is the usual clinical picture of retroperitoneal haemorrhage. The kidney is the most frequent cause and renal angiomyolipoma is the most frequent benign tumor. Renal angiomyolipoma is either isolated or associated with tuberous sclerosis in up to 20 per cent of patients. Diagnosis is suggested by sonography and confirmed by CT-scan. Renal angiography, performed in haemodynamically stable patients, shows the origin of bleeding and allows embolization. Considering the frequent bilaterality of angiomyolipoma, surgery should be as conservative as possible in order to preserve renal function."
CD008686,0,7532537,0,"Surgical management of vertebral neoplasia: who, when, how and why?","To determine the role of surgery in vertebral neoplasia, we conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing surgery for vertebral neoplasia in the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, Birmingham, and Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital, Coventry. Surgery included decompression, stabilisation or both. The neurological status was assessed by Frankel grading before and after surgery. Of 70 patients undergoing surgery, 14 were neurologically intact preoperatively, and a further 25 were weak but ambulatory. Following surgery, 35 were intact, and a further 22 were ambulatory. Sixty-six patients (94%) obtained good pain relief. Survival correlated with histology and younger age at presentation, but not with level, neurology at presentation or type of surgery. We conclude that neurological status, pain relief and mechanical stability are better after appropriate surgery than after radiotherapy or inappropriate surgery. Failure to consider the surgical option may deny the chance of significant neurological recovery."

All patients had had previous unsuccessful aspiration and excision of the cyst with recurrence. Each cyst was associated with a chronic, massive defect of the rotator cuff; superior migration of the humeral head; and degenerative osteoarthrosis of the glenohumeral joint. All patients had complained of pain and limitation of motion (mean forward elevation, 95 degrees; mean external rotation, 20 degrees; and mean internal rotation, to the spinous process of the second lumbar vertebra). All procedures consisted of a large-humeral-head hemiarthroplasty, with no operative treatment directed at the cyst or the acromioclavicular joint. At an average of twenty-seven months (range, fifteen to thirty-six months) after the operation, the patients were all pain-free and had not had a recurrence of the cyst.

CD008686,0,8410237,0,Neurosurgeon as innovator: William V. Cone (1897-1959).,"Neurosurgeons are well known for being productive researchers and innovators. Few, however, have possessed the prolific ingenuity of William Cone. In 1934, he and William Penfield were cofounders of the Montreal Neurological Institute where, until 1959, he filled the twin roles of neurosurgeon-in-chief and neuropathologist. Because he did not find writing easy, many of his technical inventions and refinements remained unpublished. His numerous innovations included the extensive use of twist-drill technique for biopsy, drainage for subdural hematoma and cerebral abscess, and ventriculography. In the mid-1940's, he developed power tools driven by nitrogen that led to the modern, universally used air-driven tool systems. He had a special interest in the treatment of spinal dysfunction, for which he invented the Cone-Barton skull-traction tongs along with the Cone spinal operating table. He also devised operative procedures for vertebral fracture-dislocation and craniospinal anomalies. For the maintenance of muscle tone in the paralyzed bladder, he constructed a tidal drainage system. He introduced and popularized ventriculoperitoneal shunting techniques and carried out some of the earliest experimental trails to treat brain infections with sulphonamide and antibiotic drugs. He designed his own set of surgical suction devices, bone rongeurs, and a personal suction ""air-conditioning"" system for each surgeon. He had a keen early interest in intracranial tumors, and also demonstrated on monkeys how subdural mass lesions caused pupillary dilation and mesial temporal lobe damage due to cerebral compression. His work for the military during World War II on effects of altitude on brain pressure remained classified for many years. The first clipping and excision of an intracranial aneurysm is attributed to Cone. Although Penfield was known as ""the Chief,"" Cone was referred to as ""the Boss."" His fervent dedication to provide total care to his patients was expressed in round-the-clock vigils; he did not separate ""nursing"" from ""surgical"" care. Ultimately, Cone's driving passion for perfection led in part to his tragic death. His accomplishments, inventions, and his example as teacher and physician have become part of neurosurgery's collective legacy."

The lesions are most frequent at the lumbosacral followed by the occipital region. CDS of the thoracic region is very rare. The patients with spinal CDS present with meningitis and/or mass effect from the associated inclusion tumor. They are usually dermoid or epidermoid cysts. Teratoma is rarely associated. The authors experienced 5 cases of spinal CDS over a 10 year period. Of the 5 cases, 2 were at thoracic and 3 were at lumbosacral levels. Dermoid cyst, epidermoid cyst and teratoma were associated in one case each. Two cases presented with neurological deficit and meningitis while an additional case presented with neurological deficit and a history of probable meningitis. Pain was present in 2 cases. Magnetic resonance imaging played an important role in the diagnosis of the lesion and planning of surgery.

Because of insufficient pain relief with morphine only, 17 of these patients received a morphine/bupivacaine mixture. Pain relief subsequently improved significantly in 10 patients and a moderate improvement was present in 4 patients. An additional analgesic effect of bupivacaine was not shown in 3 patients with clinical signs of severe mental depression. Bupivacaine-induced side effects were absent below a daily dosage of 30 mg by continuous infusion. In all patients a gradual dose increment was observed. No serious complications, neurologic sequelae or meningitis occurred. It is concluded that long-term i.t. infusion of morphine through a tunnelled catheter can provide adequate pain relief in cancer patients with an acceptable risk-benefit ratio. The effects of long-term intrathecal co-administration of local anesthetics, especially bupivacaine, await further prospective evaluation."

Clinical, imaging, pathologic, and differential considerations.","The benign bone lesions--osteoma, osteoid osteoma, and osteoblastoma--are characterized as bone-forming because tumor cells produce osteoid or mature bone. Osteoma is a slow-growing lesion most commonly seen in the paranasal sinuses and in the calvaria. When it occurs in the long bones, it is invariably juxtacortical and may need to be differentiated from, among others, parosteal osteosarcoma, sessile osteochondroma, and a matured juxtacortical focus of myositis ossificans. Osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma appear histologically very similar. Their clinical presentations and distribution in the skeleton, however, are distinct: osteoid osteoma is usually accompanied by nocturnal pain promptly relieved by salicylates; osteoblastoma arises predominantly in the axial skeleton, spinal lesions constituting one-third of reported cases. This review focuses on the application of the various imaging modalities in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and evaluation of these lesions. Their histopathology also is discussed, and their treatment briefly outlined."

He was well until June of 1991 when he had an onset of backache and right chest pain. On August 25, he lost sensation to void and he became unable to urinate. On the same day, he noted weakness in his legs which became progressively worse, and he was admitted to our hospital. Past medical history included diabetes mellitus which was found 3 years previously. He had upper gastrointestinal series 2 months before, which revealed a normal study. On admission, he was alert and general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed a mentally sound man with normal higher cerebral functions. Cranial nerves were also intact. He was unable to walk. No muscle atrophy was noted, but he had moderate to marked (2/5) weakness in both legs. No ataxia was noted in the upper extremities. Jaw jerk was normal, however, deep reflexes in the upper extremities were decreased, and absent in the lower extremities Babinski sign was present bilaterally. All sensory modalities were diminished below the Th 6 dermatome. No meningeal sign was present. Emergency myelography was performed on the day of admission, which revealed complete block from the Th4 to Th8 segments. CSF taken at that time was xanthochromic, positive Queckenstedt test containing 1,133 mg/dl of protein, 54 mg/dl of sugar and 1/3 microliters of lymphocyte. On August 31, laminectomy was performed from Th5 to Th7. The spinal bones in this area was very fragile and hemorrhagic.

Although infrequent, the ""hot and dry foot"" it constitutes an early sign of metastatic plexopathy which facilitates the differential diagnosis with preforaminal lumbosciatic radiculopathies."
CD008686,0,8233421,0,Benign osteoblastoma associated with an aneurysmal bone cyst of the mandibular ramus and condyle.,"This article reviews the clinical behavior, the histologic conditions, and the treatment of a benign osteoblastoma associated with an aneurysmal bone cyst of the mandibular condyle and ramus. A 14-year-old boy, otherwise healthy, was referred for pain and enlargement in his right temporomandibular joint-cheek region. The swelling was firm and tender, a slight facial asymmetry was present, and the mouth-opening capacity was reduced. During a 6-weeks period from the primary examination to surgery the lesion expanded extensively, anesthesia appeared in the right inferior alveolar nerve and a lateral open bite developed on the affected side. Computed tomography displayed a total destruction of the right mandibular condyle and ramus to the level of the mandibular foramen. The lesion was radiolucent without distinct borders to adjacent bone. Surgery revealed a bluish, well-vascularized predominantly cystic tumor. The lesion included the temporomandibular joint disk but without overgrowth to the temporal component. After resection of the lesion, the condyle and the mandibular ramus was reconstructed with the use of an autogenous costochondral graft. The postoperative healing was uncomplicated. At follow-up 2 years after surgery the boy was free of recurrence with normal motor and sensory nerve function."

Presentation, management and outcome.","After primary repair of myelomeningoceles or lipomyelomeningoceles, late progressive neurologic deterioration commonly occurs due to a treatable cause. In our experience many of these patients have a tethered cord. With early untethering, most patients are stabilized and a significant percent of the patients show improvement in their clinical status. Of 341 tethered cord releases done from 1981 to 1988, we report on 153 patients reoperated upon following primary repair. One hundred were performed after primary closure of a myelomeningocele and 53 after repair of a lipomyelomeningocele. The average age of the patients with a myelomeningocele was 6 years old, and for the spinal lipoma patients, 8 years old. The presenting symptoms were similar; weakness, deterioration in gait, scoliosis, orthopedic deformities, and urinary incontinence represented the most common complaints. All 153 patients were noted to have a tethered cord at operation. Additional pathology (dermoid tumors, hydromyelia, tight filum and diastematomyelia) was present in 30% of the cases. With the use of the CO2 laser for dissection, all but 10 patients could be untethered. Follow-up over an average of 4 years revealed 93% of the patients with a myelomeningocele had stabilization or improvement of their presenting complaints, and 7% had progression of their presenting complaints. All of the lipomyelomeningocele patients had either stabilization or improvement of their presenting complaints. There were no mortalities. Close follow-up and early treatment of this patient population is indicated. With release of the cord a significant portion of the population will have relief or improvement of their presenting complaints."
CD008686,0,8268043,0,A unique case of adult hypophosphatemic osteomalacia.,"A 36-year-old Russian man presented with neck and low back pain in September 1990. He was of normal stature, and there were no stigmata of rickets. The family history was negative for bone disease. He was found to have hypophosphatemia (2.3 mg/dl), impaired phosphate reabsorption (TmP/GFR 2.08), hyperphosphatasemia (254 IU/l), normocalcemia, normal vitamin D metabolite levels, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Clinically, his spinal movements were quite impaired and there was moderate proximal muscle weakness. On skeletal radiographs, there was generalized osteosclerosis and multiple ligamentous calcifications. Transiliac biopsy was diagnostic for severe osteomalacia. He was treated with oral phosphate (240 mEq daily) and calcitriol (4 micrograms daily) with resultant very slow clinical, biochemical, and histomorphologic improvement. The patient had hypophosphatemic osteomalacia with some features of X-linked hypophosphatemia, but sporadic and of relatively late onset. The osteopenia, height loss, incapacitating weakness, and glycinuria that are characteristics of sporadic adult onset nonfamilial hypophosphatemia, with or without an associated tumor, and the low serum calcitriol levels that may be an additional characteristic of tumor-induced osteomalacia were absent. Other known causes of acquired renal tubular dysfunction were ruled out. The etiology, pathogenesis, and nosology of the disorder remain obscure, but treatment based on experience with other forms of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was ultimately effective."

Report of three cases.,"The most frequent causes of painful limitation of temporomandibular joint function are myofascial pain dysfunction or anterior disk displacement. A potential problem in dealing with those patients is the risk of misdiagnosing the rare patient who has a neoplastic disease, primary or metastatic to the epipharyngeal region, parotid gland, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Three cases are presented in which progressively worsening limitation of mandibular movement and increasing pain led to the diagnosis of a neoplasm in the temporomandibular joint region.

Surgery, after MRI, revealed a large arteriovenous malformation (AVM) involving the right side of the upper cervical cord and brainstem. The woman also had two epidermal nevi at the same site as the spinal cord AVMs. There has been no previous report of an association of myelomeningocele, spinal cord AVMs and epidermal nevi syndrome. The same location of the nevus and spinal cord AVMs, with a proposed common pathogenesis, raise the possibility that the association may be more than chance occurrence. Spinal cord AVMs should be considered in patients with myelomeningocele and similar clinical features."

In 37 patients, postoperative magnetic resonance imaging confirmed that the tumor was totally removed. The morbidity of surgery was directly related to the preoperative neurological condition. Patients who were normal or nearly normal preoperatively were rarely worse after surgery, and those who had significant disability preoperatively were at greatest risk of being more impaired after surgery. There has been no tumor recurrence in any patient after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, and radiation therapy has not been employed as a surgical adjunct."
CD008686,0,8217399,0,[Dermoid cyst in the fourth ventricle associated with Klippel-Feil syndrome].,"Dermoid cysts in the central nervous system are often associated with various congenital disorders, especially dermal sinus and spina bifida. We report a case of dermoid cyst in the fourth ventricle associated with Klippel-Feil syndrome. A 47-year-old man with a long history of headache had been known to have a cystic lesion in the posterior fossa for 12 years. When he was referred to our hospital with complaints of transient tetraparesis, he showed bilateral cerebellar ataxia and minimal left hemiparesis. Furthermore, he was noted to have a webbed neck with a low hairline and facial asymmetry. CT and MRI showed multiple cerebral infarctions as well as a mass lesion in the posterior fossa. Cervical roentgenogram showed a fusion of C 2 and C 3 vertebrae. The tumor was totally removed via a suboccipital approach, and the diagnosis was a dermoid cyst. The present patient had not only dermoid cyst and Klippel-Feil syndrome but also hypertrophy of the zygomatic bone. The pathogenesis of the Klippel-Feil syndrome is presumed to be an intrauterine defect, with a failure of segmentation of mesodermal somites. The zygomatic bone is also derived from the mesoderm somites at early fourth week, too. From these points of view, the disturbance in the mesoderm before the fourth week of gestation might have played an important role in causing a dermoid cyst."
CD008686,0,8211359,0,Metastatic lesions of the cervical spine. A retrospective analysis of 20 cases.,"Twenty patients were surgically treated for metastatic lesions of the cervical spine. The primary cancer was known in 14 patients, breast cancer being the most prevalent. In six patients, the cervical metastasis was revelatory of cancer. Fourteen patients showed neurologic deficit. For the upper cervical spine, a posterior approach was employed. From C3 to C7, an anterior surgical approach was preferred. Since 1986, the authors have performed, after a corpectomy of one or more vertebrae, an acrylic corpoplasty reinforced with an anterior plate. Two cases of neurologic deterioration and one instability in lesions involving the lower cervical spine were encountered. The survival period for 17 patients was, on average, 11 months (ranging from 8 days to 46 months). Nineteen patients had pain relief. Of 14 patients with neurologic deficit, 9 experienced partial or total improvement. Three patients showed no neural recovery, whereas surgery worsened the conditions of two patients. For lower cervical lesions, the anterior approach is recommended even for C3 (retropharyngeal approach) or for cervicothoracic lesions."

These studies provoked considerable clinical interest, because they suggested a non-destructive and fully reversible method. In our department we have been gathering experience with an implantable pump system for various indications of chronic pain on a sample of 25 patients. The first implantation was performed in February 1987 and the latest included in this study in February 1991. The sample of patients consisted of two groups: (A) Chronic non-malignant pain (13 cases), (B) Chronic pain due to cancer (12 cases). We used two different pump devices: the gas-filled continuous infusion pump (Infusaid, Mod. 400) in 10 cases and the manually tractable micro pump (Cordis) in 15 cases. In 23 cases we decided in favour of an intraventricular drug administration, mainly because of the site of the pain; in each of these a ventricular catheter was placed in the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. In the remaining two cases, the catheter was placed intraspinally, the catheter tip terminating at thoracic segments. Nine of the patients with cancer-related pain experienced from excellent to acceptable pain relief, as did also 10 patients with chronic non-malignant pain. Side effects were rare. Our findings also indicate that, in carefully selected patients, both malignant and non-malignant pain may be managed satisfactorily with this technique."

CD008686,0,8355846,0,Sigmoid diverticular perforation in neurosurgical patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids.,"Perforation of colonic diverticula is a complication of corticosteroid use that has not been described in the neurosurgical literature. Between 1987 and 1992, 719 patients who underwent surgery for primary and metastatic brain and spinal tumors of the central nervous system received 2246 to 4936 mg of methylprednisolone given over at least 7 days. Five patients in this group (all men, ages 50-69 yr) experienced a sigmoid diverticular perforation at a mean dose of 3947 mg of methylprednisolone (range, 2240-6160 mg). Of these five, two had a known history of diverticular disease. In contrast, during this same period, 3749 patients who underwent neurosurgical procedures for non-neoplastic conditions did not receive corticosteroids and experienced no colonic perforations. All five patients with colonic perforations presented with abdominal pain and had free intraperitoneal air that was revealed on radiographs of the abdomen. Perforation of a sigmoid diverticulum was confirmed in all five at exploratory laparotomy. Four patients had good outcomes, and one died. We conclude the following: 1) patients over age 50 who receive high-dose corticosteroids are at risk for sigmoid colonic perforation, and these medications should be used with caution in such patients; 2) if possible, lower total doses of perioperative corticosteroids should be used in patients with known diverticular disease; and 3) because corticosteroids mask many of the inflammatory signs of perforation, this diagnosis should be considered in any patient with abdominal discomfort, fever of unknown origin, or unexplained leukocytosis."
CD008686,0,8317715,0,Management of intractable pain with percutaneous epidural spinal cord stimulation: differences in pain-relieving effects among diseases and sites of pain.,"This study is a survey of the overall clinical results achieved with our pain treatment method, percutaneous epidural low-frequency (1.6-8.0 Hz) spinal cord stimulation. It examines the relationship between the effectiveness of epidural spinal cord stimulation (ESCS) and diseases or sites of pain. Continuous indwelling of the catheter electrodes in the posterior epidural space ranged from 3 to 67 days, and the duration of percutaneous ESCS varied from less than 1 wk to more than 1 yr. Complete pain relief (100%) was achieved during stimulation in 11.5% of the patients (52 of 454). Complete (100%) to partial (more than 30%) pain relief occurred in 71.1% of the patients. In six (1.3%) patients pain was aggravated by stimulation. Analgesics and/or sedatives were discontinued completely after treatment in 52 patients (11.5%) and reduced in 263 patients (57.9%). The number of patients who rated pain relief better than 50% was significantly more in carcinoma/sarcoma and causalgia (P < 0.001), and significantly less in postherpetic neuralgia and thromboangitis obliterans/arterial sclerosis obliterans (P < 0.001) than the average in all diseases. There was a significantly high responsiveness to ESCS in female patients in comparison to male patients (P < 0.05). Pain in the head/face, neck/upper extremities, and trunk responded more to ESCS than pain in the lower extremities. Alleviation of pain by ESCS was lower when the verbal pain score was high. There were no major complications in percutaneous ESCS. Thus, we have demonstrated that pain-alleviating effects of ESCS varies significantly by disease and site of pain, and that this simple percutaneous method can be used for a relatively long period."
CD008686,0,8265240,0,Primary small cell carcinoma of the pancreas.,"A 59 yr old male presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. CT scan showed a tumor in the pancreas with secondaries in the liver, peri-pancreatic lymph nodes, vertebral bone marrow and subcutaneous tissue of the neck together with a cervical lymph node. The patient died after 2 wks and autopsy revealed complete replacement of the pancreas by tumor. Careful dissection of both lungs failed to show any tumor. A diagnosis of primary small cell carcinoma of the pancreas was made. Review of the literature indicates that this type of carcinoma accounts for about 1% of all pancreatic cancers and is commoner in elderly males who have a history of cigarette smoking. There is usually a rapid progression of disease and widespread dissemination, especially if untreated. Some success has been obtained with chemotherapy."

One of them had had nasopharyngeal cancer and received radiotherapy at a dose of 100 Gy to the C1-2 level of the spinal cord. She developed CPRM 25 months after the termination of radiotherapy. The other had had malignant lymphoma originating from the tonsil and received chemoradiotherapy. The dose delivered to her cervical spinal cord was 40 Gy, and she developed CPRM 30 months later. Gd-enhanced MRI in the early phase revealed a small crescent-shaped nidus with or without a very small central nonenhanced area in both cases. Enhancement was not great. At that time, patients noticed only the inability to perceive pain and temperature or paresthsia in the opposite side. In a few months, MRI revealed a much more strongly enhanced and larger nidus with enlargement of a central nonenhanced area accompanied by long segmental cord enlargement. The patients' neurological symptoms had also progressed, with hemiparesis developing, for example."

Forty-three of these patients were in the pediatric age group. In this clinical trial, the patients with spinal cord injuries were examined according to their age, sex, etiological factors and functional status. Frankel's scale was used for functional assessment. The mean age of patients was 9.19 +/- 4.19 years and varied between 1-16 years. The results of our classification according to etiological factors were as follows: Nineteen patients with tumors (44.1%), nine patients with infections (20.93%), five patients with congenital abnormalities (11.63%), five patients with vascular lesions (11.63%), four patients with trauma (9.30%), and one patient with a degenerative central nervous system disorder (2.32%).

CD008686,0,8327097,0,Atlanto-axial stabilization with posterior transarticular screw fixation: technical description and report of 22 cases.,"Magerl's technique of combining C1-C2 posterior screw fixation with a supplemental bone-wire fusion has been advocated for the management of atlanto-axial instability. Between October 1990 and August 1992, a modification of this technique was used in the treatment of 22 patients with this disorder. In the absence of spinal deformity or neoplastic disease, screw fixation and bony fusion were used alone without associated wiring, thus avoiding the risk of neural injury resulting from the sublaminar passage of wire and the retrodisplacement of ventral structures. Patient ages ranged from 30 months to 80 years; follow-up ranged from 5 to 27 months, with a mean of 14.9 months. The causes of the instabilities were as follows: eight cases of nonunion of Type II odontoid fracture, four cases of rheumatoid arthritis, three cases of tumor, two cases of ligamentous instability, two cases of pseudoarthrosis after bone-wire fusion, two cases of halo noncompliance, and one case of Os odontoideum. All 20 patients who underwent fusion were placed in a Philadelphia collar for 12 weeks. Nineteen of 20 (95%) patients achieved solid fusion. Twenty-one of 22 (95%) had significant reduction in preoperative pain. No patient developed myelopathy or bulbar findings. The one intraoperative complication was an inability to achieve secure screw purchase on one side that required unilateral screw placement with a Gallie fusion-using cable. Postoperative complications included one patient with a superficial wound infection that resolved after local debridement and antibiotics and suboccipital numbness in two patients. Progression of spinal deformity, screw pullout or breakage, and neurological or vascular complications did not occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,8327077,0,Evaluation of tethered cord syndrome associated with anorectal malformations.,"The clinical courses of four patients with occult spinal dysraphism who were also found to have anorectal malformations and tethered cord syndrome are evaluated in this report. These patients were among 27 patients with occult spinal dysraphism treated in the Division of Neurosurgery of Tohoku University School of Medicine during the last 3 years. All four patients experienced urinary disturbances early in life, and initially, these disturbances were considered to be caused by urogenital malformations. As a result, treatments were delayed. Only one patient with male Turner's syndrome exhibited mental retardation. Other symptoms, such as sensory disturbance and pain in the lower extremities, became apparent from complaints by the patients without atresia ani. When surgery was performed earlier in our patients with occult spinal dysraphism, the outcome was better. We believe in early surgery for tethered cord syndrome, although there is no consensus for the timing of this surgery. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of tethered cord syndrome was delayed in our four patients. However, because occult spinal dysraphism and anorectal malformations seem to be closely related, the presence of anorectal malformations may result in an earlier diagnosis of tethered cord syndrome."

The study reported on the anamnesis, clinical, laboratory and instrumental findings as well as therapy in both cases. Diagnosis was suspected on the basis of pain, refusal to assume any position that flexes the spine and irritability. Low-grade fever, the moderate increment of inflammatory indexes and the characteristic changes seen in 1 case on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) only and in the other one on both Technetium 99m polyphosphate bone-scanning and MRI verified the clinical diagnosis. Furthermore the authors briefs discuss the differential diagnosis of disc-space inflammation and several acute and subacute diseases of infancy and childhood some of them not localized in the spine (myopathy, appendicitis, peritonitis, urinary infections) for which discitis may be often mistaken."

In three patients, symptoms occurred after lumbar puncture; in four, there was no clear precipitating event. Lumbar puncture after MRI in six patients revealed low CSF pressure (six patients) and pleocytosis or high protein, or both (four patients). Three patients had subdural effusions. Six patients had measurable descent of the brain on midsagittal images. Postural headache resolved in all seven patients, six of whom had follow-up MRIs. Meningeal enhancement resolved or diminished in all six. Subdural effusions resolved spontaneously in two and were evacuated (but were not under pressure) in one. Downward brain displacement improved or resolved in all patients. The clinical syndrome and MRI abnormalities generally resolve on their own. An extensive workup is not helpful and may be misleading. Patients should be treated symptomatically."

The aim of the report is to emphasize the role played by s.m.c. in the aetiology of pain arising in these regions. As it can result from a wide variety of pathologies, like gynaecological, urological and anorectal the differential diagnosis is very difficult. Until recent years s.m.c. was rarely encountered in clinical practice and identified as a cause of chronic pain in perineal, sacral or pelvic areas. Now in the era of MRI and with increasing access to sophisticated imaging diagnostic methods s.m.c. will probably be recognized in more cases of perineal, sacral or pelvic pain."

Tracer accumulation in the diaphyses of the lower limbs and the base of the skull was accompanied by bone thickening and patency of the medullary cavity, as demonstrated by radiography, MRI, and bone marrow scanning. Comparison of the clinical pictures with the results of instrumental examinations showed that these were cases of sporadic progressive diaphyseal dysplasia of slight and average gravity, respectively.

The first patient, a 16-year-old girl with a 3-month history of radicular pain, was found to have an intradural, extramedullary mass arising on a spinal nerve root. Its resection resulted in cure. The second patient, a 63-year-old woman with a 10-month history of low back pain with radiation to both lower extremities, had a similar mass arising from one of the nerve roots of the cauda equina. In both cases, ultrastructural examination of these demarcated, oncocytic, lipid-rich lesions demonstrated abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria with tubular cristae.

Their clinical and imaging features are not very different from secondary bone lesions of other origins. They usually appear approximately 5 years after the primary tumour has been diagnosed; and they are rarely isolated, being part of a diffuse metastatic disease; their prognosis is in fact conditioned by visceral metastases (liver, lung, peritoneum). Concerning treatment, pain relieving radiotherapy is crucial, as witnesses by the authors. Chemotherapy must always be prescribed for its proven effectiveness against visceral lesions. The other medicinal treatments (e.g. analgesics, bisphosphonates) are very useful. Surgery must be reserved to emergency situations (spinal cord compression) and to patients in good general condition. To our 8 patients these treatments brought comfort and increased survival. Survivals of at least 6 to 9 months were obtained, and one patient is still alive 14 months after the diagnosis of bone metastasis.

The primary objective of this long-term trial is to evaluate whether supportive clodronate is able to prevent or retard the progression of bone disease and reduce the occurrence of characteristic complications: pain, pathologic fractures, and hypercalcemia. We now report first results as an interim analysis, including data obtained from 26 patients (total number of Tübingen patients n = 36) who entered the study at the Medizinische Universitätsklinik Tübingen. Patients were randomized to receive either chemotherapy alone (melphalan 15 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and prednisolone 60 mg/m2 orally on days 1-4 every 4 weeks (control group) or in combination with 1600 mg clodronate/day orally as a single dose for a period of at least 1 year. Repeated radiologic examinations in addition to hematologic and biochemical analysis were performed in order to evaluate the skeletal status with respect to lytic bone lesions and osteoporosis and the course of serum M protein and light chain excretion into urine. Clodronate treatment resulted in a significant decrease of serum calcium concentrations and of biochemical indices for bone resorption. No clodronate-related toxicity or hypocalcemia was observed. In patients treated with chemotherapy alone, this effect was less marked and discontinuous. Clodronate-treated patients developed fewer progressive bone lesions (significant for lytic, not for osteoporotic lesions). No hypercalcemic episodes occurred in the clodronate-treated patients, but there were six episodes in the control group. Whereas the number of vertebral fractures was evidently less is clodronate-treated patients, three of those patients suffered from multiple fractures of long bones and ribs. All together, 12 pathologic fractures occurred in five clodronate-treated patients, whereas in the control group 23 pathologic fractures occurred in the same number of patients during the whole observation period. The final analysis of all multicenter included patients should clarify these findings. There was a significant finding that clodronate proved to have an analgesic effect."
CD008686,0,8327040,0,[On some clinical aspects of extradural spinal neoplasms].,"Certain clinical aspects of extradurally situated spinal tumours are presented stressing their importance for the diagnosis and therapeutic approach. The role of pain as the first clinical symptom is emphasized. Of great importance are the plan X-ray films of the spine which in nearly 70% of cases reveal changes in bone structure. On the basis of intraoperative findings three types of infiltration of the tumours are presented, with the method of clinical management depending on this type."
CD008686,0,8492004,0,A review of oxycodone's clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.,"Oxycodone (14-hydroxy-7,8-dihydrocodeinone) is a strong opioid agonist that is available alone or in combination with mild analgesics. It is suitable for oral administration due to high bioavailability (60%), and may also be given intramuscularly, intravenously, subcutaneously, and rectally; it is not recommended for spinal administration. In analgesic potency, oxycodone is comparable to morphine. With the exception of hallucinations, which may occur more rarely after oxycodone than after morphine, the side effects of these drugs are closely related. The abuse potential of oxycodone is equivalent to that of morphine. The usual indications for oxycodone are severe acute postoperative or posttraumatic pain and cancer pain. When oxycodone is administered, the same precautions should be taken as with morphine or other agonist opioids."
CD008686,0,8442872,0,[The differential diagnosis of poliomyelitis and other acute flaccid paralyses].,"Between June 1988 to January 1991 a total of 246 children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) were seen at Hospital Infantil de México, Federico Gómez which was the center of study for AFP for the Poliomyelitis Eradication Program of Mexico. Of the 246 children, 42 has poliomyelitis (17%); 156 has Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (63.4%); 16 had traumatic neuritis of the sciatic nerve secondary to IM injections (TNC) (6.5%); five had transverse myelitis (2%); the rest (27) had other diseases misdiagnosed as polio (10.9%). The basic clinical characteristics for the diagnosis of poliomyelitis are: myalgias and fever at the onset AFP, paralysis is asymmetrical, of distal predominance and causes severe muscular atrophy and skeletal deformities; the GBS presents as an ascending, symmetrical, areflexic paralysis of distal predominance. It does not causes atrophy or deformities. TNC presents several days after IM injections with pain and hypothermia in the affected limbs; TM is a flaccid, symmetrical paraparesis with neurogenic bladder and a sensory level. CSF and neurophysiological studies (EMG and NCV) are very useful for diagnosis. Other entities misdiagnosed as poliomyelitis were: osteoarticular trauma, myopathies and dystrophies, viral myositis, acute cerebellitis, retroperitoneal tumors and upper motor neuron syndromes. Viral studies in stool specimens are essential for the diagnosis of poliomyelitis."

A synovectomy was performed. Clinical and histological findings led to the diagnosis of pigmented villonodular synovitis of the knee joint. Only one previous case of this association has been reported. A common aetiology for both diseases is discussed, and traumatic factors should be considered in the aetiology of the association."
CD008686,0,8421211,0,Spinal angiolipomas. Report of three cases.,"Spinal angiolipomas are distinct, benign lesions composed of mature lipocytes admixed with abnormal blood vessels. Three new cases of spinal angiolipoma are presented and 34 previously reported cases are analyzed. The 37 total cases (23 females and 14 males) ranged in age from 17 to 73 years (mean 43 years; median 45 years). The mean age of the female patients was older than that for the males (45.0 vs. 41.6 years; p < 0.001, Student's t-test) and most were peri- or postmenopausal. Prior to diagnosis, 97% of the patients had weakness of the lower extremities, 94% had sensory dysfunction, 84% had hyperreflexia and spasticity, 51% had sphincter dysfunction, and 41% had back pain lasting from 1 to 180 months (mean 28 months). Five (22%) of the 23 female patients were pregnant and two had exhibited significant weight gain coincident with the onset of symptoms. The angiolipomas were extradural in 35 patients and intramedullary in two; seven of the extradural lesions infiltrated the surrounding bone. The tumors extended from C-6 to L-4 and had a predilection for the midthoracic region (53% of cases). Plain radiographs were abnormal in 11 (39%) of 28 patients and in all patients with bone infiltration. Myelograms were abnormal in 97% of 32 patients and showed a complete block in 63% of patients. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed the fat-density lesions in all cases studied. There was vascular enhancement in three of five cases with contrast-infused CT and in the one case with gadolinium-infused MR imaging. All patients improved following resection of the epidural lesions and internal decompression of the intramedullary lesions. It is concluded that spinal angiolipomas predominantly affect women. They involve the thoracic (especially the midthoracic) region, and produce symptoms and signs of spinal compression and, in some cases, bone erosion and pathological fractures. Their symptomatology can be exacerbated by pregnancy and weight gain, suggesting that vascular engorgement and the presence of obesity influence their evolution. Their preponderance in older, peri-, or postmenopausal women, and their clinical exacerbation in pregnant women support a role for hormonal influence. Magnetic resonance imaging is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis of these lesions. Surgery is universally successful in relieving symptoms."
CD008686,0,8383986,0,[Paraganglioma of the cauda equina].,"The case of a 36 year old woman with a paraganglioma of the cauda equina was studied. This localization is rare and special emphasis is made concerning the peculiarities of presentation, aggravating factors of the clinical manifestations and neuroradiologic findings. A review of the 66 paragangliomas of the cauda equina published to date is carried out. This entity deals with a tumor in the adult, with slight male predominance and a clinical presentation not differing from that of other lesions occupying the space of the cauda equina. The most frequent initial symptom is low back pain with or without sciatic irradiation. Total resection of the tumor may cure the patient."
CD008686,0,8095734,0,[Long-term epidural administration of opiates].,"Spinal administration of morphine and other opiates has been used in clinical practice since many years, particularly in the outpatient management of cancer pain patients. The rationale and the safety of chronic spinal opiate administration is well established and not questioned anymore. However, the indications to use these therapies remain unclear, essentially because no controlled studies have ever shown the advantages of these treatments. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that some patients are unable to get adequate pain relief with conventional oral opiate administration, and will significantly benefit from the change to the spinal route. This raises technological and financial issues, as well as management problems related to the home care system. The choices that have to be made should include the home physician, the home care nursing team as well as the hospital based pain management team. This short overview will deal with some of these aspects."

Physical examination, chest X-ray, ultrasonography and computed tomography of the abdomen provided no specific pointers to a diagnosis. He was anaemic (haemoglobin 95 g/l), but had a normal WBC count with neutrophilia (up to 91%) and thrombocytopenia (up to 24,000/microliters). The transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase activities were raised, as were the bilirubin level and the retention values. There was a metabolic acidosis (pH 7.20). Because of suspected septicaemia ciprofloxacin (twice daily 200 mg) was administered intravenously. But the patient gradually lost consciousness, required mechanical ventilation and died 24 hours after admission in circulatory failure. Autopsy revealed a meningoencephalitis, carcinoma of unknown primary with bone marrow carcinomatosis as well as widespread carcinomatosis of blood and lymph vessels. The findings of blood, urine and sputum cultures, available only postmortally, revealed growth of tetracycline-resistant Salmonellae enteritidis."

However, no cases of severe osteoporosis with multiple vertebral collapses secondary to treatment in children with ALL have been reported. We report the case of a 9-year-old-boy with B-ALL, with no bone lesions at the diagnosis that, following the 4th block of aggressive chemotherapy (protocol B-ALL BFM 86), presented severe back pain and functional impairment with diffuse osteoporosis and vertebral collapses. He was treated with calcitonin, vitamin D, calcium, physical therapy and orthopedic corset. Osteoporosis progressed slowly during the following 2 months of chemotherapy and the boy developed dorsal kyphosis. After discontinuing antiblastic treatment progressive clinical improvement was observed, with complete resolution of kyphosis in about 6 months. An almost complete bone recovery was seen on X-ray survey at 26-months follow-up."

CD008686,0,8416240,0,The natural history and management of symptomatic and asymptomatic vertebral hemangiomas.,"Fifty-nine cases of vertebral hemangioma were seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1980 and 1990. Vertebral hemangiomas were discovered incidentally in 35 patients, while pain was the presenting complaint in 13 patients. Five patients presented directly with progressive neurological deficit requiring surgery, and six patients had surgery elsewhere for spinal cord compression and were referred for follow-up evaluation. To better define the natural history of these lesions, a historical review of these patients was conducted; progression of an asymptomatic or painful lesion to neurological symptoms was found in only two cases (mean follow-up period 7.4 years, range 1 to 35 years). New-onset back pain followed by subacute progression (mean time to progression 4.4 months, range 0.25 to 12 months) of a thoracic myelopathy was the most common presentation for patients with neurological deficit. Initially, all 11 patients with spinal cord compression underwent decompressive surgery with full neurological recovery. Recurrent neurological symptoms were observed in three of six patients following subtotal tumor resection and postoperative administration of 1000 cGy or less radiation therapy (mean follow-up period 8.7 years, range 1 to 17 years). No recurrences were noted in four patients who had subtotal excision plus radiotherapy between 2600 and 4500 cGy. One other patient had gross total tumor removal without radiotherapy and has not had a recurrence. Based on these patients and a review of the literature, the authors recommend annual neurological and radiological examinations for patients with hemangiomas associated with pain, especially young females with thoracic lesions in whom spinal cord compression is most likely to develop. Radiation therapy or embolization is an effective therapeutic alternative for patients with severe medically refractory pain. Regular follow-up monitoring for patients with asymptomatic lesions is unnecessary unless pain develops at the appropriate spinal level. It is concluded that management of patients with a progressive neurological deficit should include preoperative angiography and embolization, decompressive surgery with the approach determined by the degree of vertebral involvement and site of spinal cord compression, and postoperative radiation therapy in patients following subtotal tumor removal. Operative management and complications are discussed."
CD008686,0,8379160,0,[Spinal diseases: vertebral complaints in relation to site and age].,"Disorders of the vertebral column are one of the most common causes of pain in the human being. The nosological classification of various disorders is carried out according to many different criteria, e.g. topical pain descriptions such as cervical syndrome and lumbago in particular, but more often also according to purely speculative factors such as intervertebral disc lesions, muscular rheumatism etc. The analysis of each single structural disturbance which could come into question is a primary function of the anamnesis, and in particular of the clinical examination, which must seek, respectively recognize signs not only of functional disturbances but also of functional devastations, in order to then objectify the structural devastation in particular using a number of different methods. The therapeutic consequences are drawn from the actual diagnosis, which must, above all, distinguish between the acute and the chronic symptoms, in order to then influence those as well as these symptoms in the foreground. Vertebral complaints express themselves in different ways depend on the age of the patient, a fact which must be taken into consideration when forming a diagnosis."
CD008686,0,8379159,0,[The spine in adulthood].,"Back pain and low back pain can be caused by extravertebral diseases, functional disorders or morphologic changes of the spine. Diagnosis of back pain is mainly done by clinical examination. The examination of segmental mobility is necessary to make the diagnosis of functional disorders. X-ray and laboratory are mainly used to exclude morphologic changes of the spine. Functional disorders are best treated by chirotherapy completed by rehabilitation of the active motion apparatus. The most important morphologic diseases of the spine causing back pains are deformities, especially lumbar scoliosis, infectious diseases as pyogenous or specific spondylitis, rheumatic diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, mostly at the occipitocervical region, and Bechterew's disease, furthermore instability caused by spondylolisthesis or iatrogenic low back pain as the failed-backsyndrome and tumors, which are in the majority metastases. The role of degenerative changes as a cause of back pain is difficult to estimate. The operative treatment of spinal instability, which has changed in the last years is described, as modern treatment facilities of lumbar disc herniation as chemonucleolysis or percutaneous nucleotomy."
CD008686,0,8333313,0,Percutaneous facet denervation in chronic thoracic spinal pain.,"In 40 patients with chronic thoracic spinal pain of more than 12 months duration which failed to respond to conservative treatment and with a previous evaluation by specialists, mainly neurologists and orthopaedic surgeons, the diagnosis of facet syndrome was made. This diagnosis was based on clinical criteria and a transient positive response to a prognostic blockade of the medial branch of the dorsal ramus of the thoracic spinal nerve. They were selected to undergo percutaneous radiofrequency denervation of the facet joints. The short and long-term results of 51 percutaneous thoracic facet denervations in 40 patients are described. After 2 months, 19 patients (47.5%) were pain-free, 14 patients (35%) had more than 50% pain-relief, and 7 patients (17.5%) had no relief. After a follow-up of 18-54 (average 31) months in 36 cases (3 patients had died because of malignancy, and 1 had undergone a spinal fusion), 16 patients (44%) were pain-free, 14 patients (39%) had more than 50% pain-relief and in 6 cases (17%) the result was poor. Adverse effects consisted of postoperative pain in 5 patients (12.5%). When conservative treatment fails, percutaneous thoracic facet denervation can be a safe and beneficial therapy in chronic thoracic spinal pain originating from the facet joints."
CD008686,0,8304076,0,Reversibility of severe brain stem dysfunction in children.,"The very popular concept of brain death can lead to a defeatist attitude when confronted by a patient with severe brain stem dysfunction. This problem is compounded by the constant controversy surrounding the establishing of criteria to determine brain death. Many young doctors tend to accept the precondition of irreversibility as being any condition that is not explicitly listed in the examples of potentially reversible conditions. In children, however, with compressive brain stem dysfunction, decompressive surgery can lead to a reversal of the dysfunction. In the last three years, we have had the opportunity to observe 5 children who were deeply comatose and apnoeic. All were suffering from compression of the brain stem and experienced dramatic return of brain stem function following emergency decompression. The implications of these findings on the therapeutic attitude towards compressive brain stem lesions in children are exposed. In children with severe brain stem dysfunction, and no evidence of brain stem destruction, decompressive surgery should be undertaken before a diagnosis of brain death is considered."

The patient group consisted of 23 patients with multisegmental cervical spondylosis, 9 patients with primary or metastatic malignant tumour disease spread along the cervical spine, 6 patients with complex cervical trauma and 6 patients with infection affecting one or more cervical segments. Considering the heterogeneity of the group of patients treated, a multitude of neurological symptoms and signs were present. Excruciating pain was the predominant symptom in 84% of the patients, followed by sensory and motor signs of varying degrees in 77% and 65% respectively. Involvement of the long tracts was present in 51%, gait disturbance in 49% and bladder disfunction in 28%. Considering the nature of the underlying disease, in the group with multisegmental cervical spondylosis (MSCS), advanced cervical myelopathy was the predominant clinical symptom, whereas in those patients with trauma, tumour or infection, pain was the leading symptom, followed by disturbed motor and/or sensory function. Altogether 59 vertebrae have been removed in the 44 patients. In 28 patients spondylectomy was performed at one level, in 15 patients at two levels and in one female tumour patient at three levels. In 34 patients an iliac crest bone graft was used and in 10 patients bone cement. Within the observation period, solid fusion was achieved in all patients. In one tumour patient screw loosening was demonstrable at follow-up, but the fusion remained stable. 2 patients with infectious disease required re-operation due to significant loosening of screws and plates. However, after re-stabilization solid fusion was achieved. Considering amelioration of specific pre-operative symptoms and signs, excruciating pain responded best to the stabilizing procedure, with improvement in over 90% of the patients, followed by improvement of sensory and motor deficits in 85% and 82% respectively. Improvement in pre-operative gait disturbance could be achieved in 81% of the patients, while disturbance of bladder function is less likely to improve after surgery with a positive response in only 58%. None of the patients became neurologically worse after surgery. With regard to the underlying disease, patients with MSCS and tumour had the best results with overall improvement in 62% and 75% respectively. While in patients with infection improvement could be achieved in 58%, improvement in trauma patients was demonstrable in only 34% while in 66% the pre-operative clinical status remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,8242021,0,[Sarcoma of the spine in Paget's disease of bone. Apropos of 8 cases].,"Eight cases of spinal sarcoma complicating Paget's disease seen in different centers were reviewed. Clinical and radiological features of this condition were determined on the basis of these 8 cases and of 51 previously published cases. In the current series as well as in previous reports, most cases involved the lumbar and sacral spine and manifested as low back pain with sciatica and early development of neurological deficits. Roentgenographic diagnosis proved difficult because of the anatomic complexity of the spine and architectural changes characteristic of the pagetic bone. The most common radiological features was a mixed pattern with both sclerosis and central osteolysis. Computed tomography performed in one patient of current series disclosed osteolysis of the sacrum (not visible on plain roentgenograms) with tumor spread to adjacent soft tissues. Features shared by spinal and nonspinal sarcomas complicating Paget's disease include advanced mean age of patients, predominance of osteogenic sarcomas among histologic forms, increased risk of sarcoma in polyostotic Paget's disease, and a very grim prognosis. Development of a neurological deficit in a patient with Paget's disease is an unusual occurrence which should suggest sarcomatous transformation. Roentgenographic changes are difficult to identify on plain films of the spine and consequently CT scan studies are warranted whenever a sarcoma is suspected."
CD008686,0,8237513,0,Introduction of a score system for the clinical evaluation of patients with spinal processes.,"To facilitate statistical analysis of the clinical course of patients with spinal lesions such as tumours, dysraphic malformations, inflammation, or syringomyelia, we have developed a score system for each of the following symptoms and signs: sensory deficits, dysaesthesiae, pain, motor weakness, gait, bladder and bowel function. For each a score between 0 and 5 is given. The grading is designed in such a way that levels of functional significance receive separate scores: 0 = no function, 1 = severely disabled, 2 = disabled, 3 = severely compromised but function preserved, 4 = slightly compromised, and 5 = normal function. In general, scores between 0 and 2 indicate insufficient functional capacity and an unsatisfactory condition. Scores between 3 and 5 represent levels of function which should be the aim of treatment. We have used this scoring system for evaluation of almost 500 patients with spinal lesions both retrospectively and prospectively with good results in terms of reproducibility and validity."

Only patients with pathological spinal instability and neurological sequelae were included. Posterior decompression and stabilization was performed in all but six patients. All but four patients (91%) reported decrease of pain symptoms. Amelioration of neurological function was achieved in 58%. Re-establishment of walking ability was obtained in 57%. Post-surgery life expectancy averaged 11 months. In patients with widespread metastatic disease and/or multi-level instability of the spine restriction to palliative dorsal procedures is sensible.

CD008686,0,8213285,0,CT-guided percutaneous selective cordotomy.,"In this article the technique of CT-Guided Selective Cordotomy is described. The advantages of CT guidance in percutaneous cordotomy are the measurement of spinal cord diameters at the lesion site for each individual patient, direct visualization of target electrode relations, demonstration of spinal cord displacement during the procedure and localization of the electrode system in a specific part of the spinothalamic tract. Local destruction of the spinothalamic tract leads to selective cordotomy. Since 1987, CT-Guided Cordotomy has been applied to 54 cases of intractable cancer pain. In 33 of the 54 cases, the cordotomy was selective enough to be successful with a local denervation of the area where the pain was dominant. Except for one temporary hemiparesis and one temporary ataxia, no complications or side effects were observed."

In TN in 128 (87%) patients vascular compression of the fifth nerve was found, in 8 (5%)--compression by a tumour, but in 11 (7.5%) nerve compression was not observed. In 92 (63%) patients only microvascular decompression (MVD) was performed, but in 36 (24.5%)--MVD and partial sensory rhyzotomy (PSR). Following MVD pain was absent or insignificant in 121 (92%) after MVD and PSR in all 36 patients, recurrence was observed in 5 (5%) cases. MVD was inefficient in case of atypical TN. Two patients died. As diagnostic criteria for vascular decompression pre-operative and intra-operative recording of short latency somatosensory evoked potentials of the fifth nerve were used. In all HFS patients vascular compression of the facial nerve roots has been established. Following MVD spasm was absent in 18 (69%) patients, 6 (23%) patients had significant improvement, but in two cases (8%) the improvement was insignificant. During craniospinal exploration in ST the accessory nerve was compressed in 6 cases by artery, in 6 patients only by cross-sectional adhesions, in two by a hypertrophied dentate ligament and in 3 cases by small neurinomas of the XI th nerve. Following microdecompression of the accessory nerve (without roots transsection) 17 (77%) patients fully recovered or had significant improvement. One of the 4 patients with insignificant improvement had previously undergone stereotactic surgery, but the other had retrocollis. In one patient with neurinoma of the XI nerve recurrence was observed, no significant improvement was noted in the other two patients."

Anatomical and clinical observations on 73 patients.,"Neoplastic involvement of the trigeminal nerve was observed in 73 patients operated on in our institution for extra-axial tumours of the posterior and middle cranial fossae. It was defined as contact, compression, or infiltration. The nerve root was involved in 58 patients, the ganglion and/or the peripheral divisions in 9, all portions of the Vth nerve system in 6. A clinical trigeminal dysfunction was present in 44 patients (60%). Anatomico-surgical findings are correlated with clinical features and with tumour type. Typical trigeminal neuralgia was the complaint in 7 subjects; all of them presented an involvement of the sensory root. Post-operatively, 11 patients were relieved of their symptoms. The outcome is correlated with the anatomical findings and with the extent of surgical removal of the tumours. The importance of a careful evaluation of patients with trigeminal symptomatology is stressed."

He presented with severe back pain, persistent cough and fever. A left lung infiltrate was noted on chest X-ray film. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from arterial blood. Thoracic bone destruction with pleural mass lesion confirmed by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance image (MRI). These findings mislead our diagnosis to pyogenic osteomyelitis associated with NIDDM. An absence of marked clinical and roentgenological improvement after antibiotic therapy and strict glycemic control with insulin was noted. This suggested to us the need for needle biopsy of the osteolytic and mass lesions confirmed by imaging techniques. This resulted in making the diagnosis of metastasis of small cell carcinoma from the left lung. The correlation between NIDDM and pulmonary small cell carcinoma possibly induced by genetic abnormality remains to be resolved. By making the most of imaging techniques and needle biopsy, the possibility of pulmonary small cell carcinoma complicating NIDDM can be appropriately evaluated."

Pathogenic and anatomoclinical focus apropos of a case of multiple bone metastases disclosed by vertebral involvement].,"This report describes a case of a cerebral glioblastoma with multiple metastases appeared two years after craniotomy and revealed by a diffuse vertebral involvement with a lumbo-sciatic pain. The experimental and clinical data from the literature about distant localizations of glioblastoma give the arguments for the rarity and the pathogenic modes of the natural course. The distant localizations of cerebral glioblastoma, identified by immunohistochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, occurred in young patients, late in the follow-up which the duration is longer than those of classical glioblastomas; their occurrence hasten the disease course. Two distinct oncological entities might be identified: metastases, using blood or lymphatic pathways, commonly from a supra-tentorial primary tumor, are facilitated by surgical treatment; their exclusive extraneural sites are usually symptomatic; grafts, by seeding via cerebrospinal fluid pathways, are spontaneous or facilitated by tumoral removal and are disseminated along the neuraxis; they occur frequently and are usually asymptomatic; when shunts induce them, it gives rise to symptomatic peritoneal seeding; they seem to concern poor invading primary glioblastomas.

Rapid as well as complete reduction of pain without systemic side effects can be achieved under local anesthesia in patients in advanced tumor stages by the direct instillation of 50 to 96% alcohol and/or a locally efficacious low toxic cytostatic (Mitoxantron) under CT guidance. CT enables not only exact puncture without injuring endangered structures but also a controlled application of medication. The interventions can be performed with special probes with a diameter of 18 to 25 G. The study population consisted of 145 patients who received a total of 434 treatments. Repeated micro invasive intratumoral treatment was performed on 110 patients with bone and soft tissue metastases (Group I, 335 single treatments) and on 35 patients with vertebral metastases (Group II, 109 single treatments). In all patients conventional therapeutic strategies had been exhausted or were no longer applicable on the basis of a reduced Karnofsky Index. Treatment was performed in combination with sympathetic neurolysis at the upper tumor pole in all cases. The maximum follow-up time was 30 months. Pain reduction was estimated on a visual analogic scale. In Group I up to time of death a pain reduction of 75% or better was achieved in 88 patients (80%). A reduction in tumor size concomitant with a stabilization of the tumor region could be shown in 25% in this group, no change in 62% and progression in 13%. In Group II a pain reduction greater than 75% was achieved in 84% as well as a reduction in tumor size (< 50%) in 18% of the patients. Necrotic zones could be shown in 27% and calcification of tumor area in 35%. No change in tumor size was found in 66% of the patients, progression in 16%. All treatments were free of complications. On the whole the results of this therapeutic approach are encouraging. In particular one aspect should be mentioned: with respect to palliative treatment the reduction of tumor size is not crucial. The decisive factor is the improvement in quality of life of the patient using an intervention which impairs the patient only minimally. Furthermore this micro invasive approach should always involve the combination of local tumor treatment with treatment or lysis of the autonomic sympathetic nervous system in tumor vicinity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,7505182,0,Audit of neural blockade for palliative care patients in an acute unit.,"During the period from September 1990 to March 1992, 155 nerve blocks were performed for 125 patients as part of the clinical management of pain due to malignant disease. The efficacy, in terms of pain score reduction, and spontaneously reported side effects secondary to these procedures were prospectively audited. Neural blockade was undertaken in accordance with strict clinical criteria, and medication was optimized with the aim of achieving maximum analgesia with minimum side effects at all times. Pain was assessed before the block, 24 hours after the block and at follow-up (two to six weeks) using visual analogue scores or verbal rating scales. All patients were audited. The total (all patients, all blocks) median (lower-upper quartile) pain score dropped from 8 (6-10) cm before the block to 2 (0-4) cm at 24 hours after the block (p < 0.05) and to 1 (0-4) cm at follow-up (p < 0.005). A concomitant reduction in analgesic requirements was observed. The incidence of serious side effects was low (two patients in this series). The results indicate the usefulness of these techniques for patients in the palliative care setting."

Nine died after a first cordotomy and three after a second (contralateral) procedure. All except one had known pulmonary disease before operation. The operated segment of the spinal cord (C2) was studied histologically after death. Superposition of lesion outlines made it possible to determine those parts of the lesioned areas common to all unilateral and bilateral cases respectively. All cases dying of presumed respiratory dysfunction syndrome had lesions involving the region of the anterolateral funiculus in the C2 segment containing ""pain"" fibres activated from the second to fifth thoracic dermatomes. The fibres whose destruction appeared to be responsible for respiratory dysfunction syndrome were completely intermingled with ascending ""pain"" fibres. The possibility of these fibres being afferent in function is discussed."

Surgery was performed for lumbar vertebral column instability secondary to fractures (28 cases), spondylolisthesis (29), tumors (four), vertebral osteomyelitis (two), or postoperative causes (41). Pseudoarthrodesis due to failure of a prior fusion was present in 37 cases. The 55 men and 49 women (mean age 47 years, range 18 to 87 years) all presented with severe back pain. Signs or symptoms of neural compression were noted in 96 patients. Surgery consisted of neural decompression, internal fixation, and autogenous iliac bone grafting. Spondylolistheses were fused in situ, without reduction; otherwise, major spinal deformities were corrected. A total of 516 pedicle screws were placed. The mean extent of fusion was 2.7 motion segments (range one to six motion segments). A 96% fusion rate was obtained with a mean follow-up period of 20 months. There were no operative deaths. Major complications included one spinal epidural hematoma, three isolated nerve root deficits (two transient, one permanent), and three wound infections (two deep, one superficial). Instrument failure eventually developed in 18 patients; nine were asymptomatic with a solid fusion and did not require further treatment and the other nine were symptomatic or had a pseudoarthrosis and required operative revision. Pedicle screw-rod fixation offers biomechanical advantages compared to other forms of internal fixation for the lumbar spine. It enables short-segment fixation with preservation of lumbar lordosis and adjacent normal motion segments. This technique provides a highly successful method to obtain arthrodesis, even with prior pseudoarthrosis."

A diagnosis of Cauda Equina Syndrome was suspected on the history and the clinical examination. A plain X-ray of her lumbar spine revealed evidence of a slow growing mass within the vertebral canal at the level of L3.

Except for hypercalcemia, routine chemistry values were within normal limits. Hemoglobin was decreased and the leukocyte count slightly increased. Plasma cells were not observed in the peripheral blood. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a monoclonal protein in the beta-globulin fraction. Immunofixation confirmed the presence of an IgE kappa monoclonal protein. A bone marrow biopsy revealed an interstitial and nodular infiltration of abnormal plasma cells comprising 60% of nucleated cells present. Skeletal roentgenograms and bone scans of this patient showed osteolytic lesions and osteopenia of the thoracic and lumbar spine and osteolytic destruction of the right half of the sacrum. Flow-cytometric analysis of mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood showed that 15% of the lymphocytes bound IgE. Using cell-surface markers, we identified 45% of the IgE-positive cells as natural killer cells. Similar results have been found in other diseases marked by increased IgE. The clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings for this patient are compared with previously reported cases of IgE and other types of myeloma."
CD008686,0,1463157,0,[Intrathecal morphine for postoperative pain].,"At the beginning, the way intrathecal morphine was used for postoperative pain relief was quite unfortunate, because the doses derived from experience with morphine-tolerant cancer patients were considerably too high and respiratory depression occurred frequently. Subsequent dose-finding studies showed that the doses of morphine used initially could be reduced by a factor of ten without loss of the analgesic effect and with a marked reduction in side-effects. No respiratory depression has been reported when doses below 0.1 mg morphine are used. METHOD. In this prospective study the effect of 0.06 to 0.08 mg intrathecal morphine, mixed with the local anaesthetic for spinal anesthesia, was investigated in surgical patients aged 21 to 81 years, ASA grade I or II, scheduled for orthopaedic operations or herniorraphies. Thirty unpremedicated patients were enrolled in the study and were, after informed consent, randomly allocated to a control group without morphine or to a morphine group. The analgesic effect was assessed by the time interval between the administration of the spinal anaesthesia and the first demand for an analgesic medication. The mood state was evaluated with the adjective checklist of Janke and Debus 6 h after the spinal anaesthesia. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. In the control group half of the patients asked for an analgesic medication within 275 min (median) after the spinal anaesthesia, and all patients within 420 min, whereas in the morphine group half of the patients asked for an analgesic within 1170 min (median). Seven patients had not required an analgesic at the termination of the observation period 20 h after the spinal anaesthesia. The mood status showed no difference between the two groups, in particular, no dizziness or drowsiness after morphine. There was no difference in the incidence of side-effects such as nausea or urinary retention between the two groups. Pruritus was not reported spontaneously but was found upon questioning in five patients. It was in no case disturbing. CONCLUSIONS. Morphine (0.06 to 0.08 mg) mixed with the local anaesthetic for spinal anaesthesia provided for an analgesia of more than 20 h duration in half of the patients. This technique is safe, simple, reliable and virtually free of side-effects. No particular supervision due to the administration of intrathecal morphine is necessary in this dose range if systemic opiates are avoided. If the analgesia is unsatisfactory, a non-opioid analgesic is recommended."

Intradural well defined solitary cystic lesions in the spinal canal are uncommon, their pathogenesis is poorly understood, and their nomenclature is confusing. In this case the cyst was a bronchogenic cyst; these are a rare form of such cysts and they are thought to be a malformation arising from a split notochordal syndrome and not a teratoma."
CD008686,0,1394060,0,Spinal epidural tumor in patients with prostate cancer. Clinical and radiographic predictors of response to radiation therapy.,"The authors retrospectively reviewed 50 episodes of spinal epidural tumor that occurred in 42 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and were treated with external-beam radiation. Treatment response was evaluated in terms of symptoms, neurologic status, and, in most cases, reduction of tumor on repeat myelography. At the completion of therapy, 92% of treated patients experienced pain relief and 67% had significant to complete improvement on neurologic examination. Thirty days after treatment, repeat myelography was performed in 40 of the 50 cases; compared with the initial findings immediately preceding radiation therapy (RT), the results of 58% of these studies had normalized completely, results were improved in 25%, and the results had not changed in 18%. The presence of a high-grade compression fracture of the vertebral body was an indicator of poor prognosis for tumor response on repeat myelography. The ability of a patient to walk before treatment and tumor response on repeat myelography were associated significantly with improved outcome of RT and with survival. The authors conclude that RT can effectively palliate epidural lesions from metastatic prostate cancer. The prognosis for the long-term response to therapy may be indicated by pretreatment ambulatory status and posttreatment imaging of the epidural space."
CD008686,0,1333942,0,[The Askin tumor].,"The Askin tumor, a primitive malignant small-cell tumor of the chest wall, is mostly seen among children and adolescents. It is closely related to Ewing's sarcoma of the same location, both tumors showing a chromosomal translocation t(11;22). Its origin from neuroectodermal cells is deducted from several ultrastructural details and from the expression of specific markers like NSE. Pain and deformation of the chest wall are the cardinal clinical signs of the tumor. Chest X-rays will frequently show destruction of ribs and pleural effusions. Effective therapy consists of radical surgery, local radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy. This multimodal concept allows minority of patients to remain disease-free but the overall outcome is rather unfortunate."
CD008686,0,1301334,0,[Serial magnetic resonance imaging of spinal syrinx formation in a case of multiple sclerosis].,"A 27-year-old woman had a subacute onset of back pain, dysesthesia and weakness of both arms. Neurological examination revealed bilateral pyramidal signs, paresthesia of both hands and arms, and hypalgesia below T-4. CSF showed no abnormal findings. T2-weighted MR images revealed linear high signal within the cervical and upper thoracic cord, but no syrinx. The signs and symptoms resolved substantially within three months, with the exception of paroxysmal itching localized to the right forearm. At age 30, she experienced an acute onset of back pain, and dysesthesia of both feet. She developed weakness of both legs and urinary retention two days after the onset. Neurological examination showed bilateral pyramidal signs in the lower extremities, hypalgesia below T-4, hypopallesthesia on both legs, but no abnormalities in the upper extremities. CSF contained 8 white cells/mm3, protein 17 mg/dl and glucose 44 mg/dl. Oligoclonal bands were not detected. T1-weighted, proton density, and T2-weighted MR images revealed a syrinx formation within the spinal cord, extending from the level of T-2 to T-5. There was no evidence of spinal tumor. MRI of the brain revealed multiple areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted image, consistent with multiple sclerosis. The signs and symptoms resolved substantially within two months. The syrinx within the thoracic cord reduced in size after two months and disappeared after three months. Two months after the second episode of myelopathy, she experienced right optic neuritis, resolving substantially within three weeks. This case was diagnosed as definite multiple sclerosis based on the clinical and radiological findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,1281341,0,Posterior decompression and stabilization for multiple metastatic tumors of the spine.,"Although the value of surgical decompression and stabilization for solitary spinal metastasis is well documented, indication for surgery for advanced multiple metastatic tumors of the spine is controversial. In this study, the clinical effect of posterior decompression and stabilization was investigated in 11 patients with advanced multiple spinal metastases with unfavorable conditions. Mean blood loss during surgery was 3000 g. Disseminated intravascular coagulation occurred in three patients. Neurologic improvement was observed in nine patients. There was no neurologic deterioration due to surgery in any patients. A measure of pain relief was obtained in all patients. However, the postoperative longevity was short and the patients died 2.5 months (on average) after operation, except in cases of breast cancer. The effect of the posterior surgery on multiple spinal metastases depended on primary diseases. In cases of short life expectancy, the effect of the surgery was limited only to the short duration of neurologic improvement, pain relief, and ease of nursing care while confronted with grave surgical morbidity. In cases of long life expectancy with tumors like breast cancer, however, posterior decompression and stabilization were expected to exert long-term therapeutic effect. Therefore, the posterior surgery for multiple spinal metastases is cautiously indicated considering the nature of the primary tumor."
CD008686,0,1527609,0,The influence of transoral odontoid resection on stability of the craniovertebral junction.,"Twenty-seven cases of craniovertebral junction compression treated with transoral surgery were reviewed to assess the influences of pathological processes and surgical interventions on spinal stability. All patients presented with signs and symptoms of spinal-cord or brain-stem dysfunction. Pathology included rheumatoid arthritis in 11 patients, congenital osseous malformations in 11, spinal fractures in two, plasmacytoma in one, osteomyelitis in one, and a gunshot injury in one. Instability was defined as clear radiographic evidence of mobile subluxation in conjunction with clinical assessment. Of 19 patients (70%) requiring internal fixation, nine underwent upper cervical fusion and 10 had occipitocervical fusion. When instability occurred, all subluxations were at the C1-2 level. There were no occipito-atlantal subluxations. Eight patients (30%) had preoperative instability of the craniovertebral junction due solely to their pathology, 11 patients (40%) suffered instability after transoral surgery, and eight (30%) were without clinical or radiographic evidence of instability (mean follow-up period 14 months). Craniovertebral junction instability predominated among patients with rheumatoid arthritis: 91% required fusion and 45% presented with pre-existing instability. Among individuals with congenital osseous malformations, 45% required fusion and only one patient (9%) had pre-existing instability. Patients who required subsequent posterior decompression of a Chiari malformation were at risk for developing instability; three of four became unstable after posterior decompression. Transoral resection of the dens, the anterior arch of C-1, and the lower clivus does not fully destabilize the spine; however, this operation may potentiate incipient pathological instability. The primary determinants of instability are the extent of pathological bone destruction, ligamentous weakening, and operative bone removal. Long-term follow-up monitoring is needed after transoral surgery to detect cases of late instability."
CD008686,0,1477892,0,Back pain in children and teenagers.,"Controversial opinions have been published concerning the frequency of LBP among children and adolescents. Studies from orthopaedics or neurosurgical departments have reported low figures for prevalence of specific LBP due to serious disorders. Field surveys, on the contrary, have shown that cumulative life prevalence of non-specific LBP in children and teenagers can be comparable to the prevalence data for adult populations. Some specific diagnoses are more common or characteristic of children complaining of LBP. Age, gender, sports activities and family history of LBP have been found to be significantly associated with an increased prevalence in non-specific LBP among children. Low back pain among children and teenagers is common and should be recognized. This chapter provides guidelines for a clinical approach and differential diagnoses. Most back pain in these age groups is benign and should be treated as such."

CD008686,0,1450438,0,Bone metastasis in breast cancer.,"Bone metastases in breast cancer are common and frequently lead to serious skeletal related morbid complications. Metastases develop in areas of metabolically active trabecular bone. It is presumed that breast cancer cells undergo the same stepwise process for metastases development as demonstrated in other tumor types. The specific factor or factors responsible for the osteotropism of breast cancer have not been identified. The morbid events associated with skeletal metastases, such as pathologic fracture, and spinal cord compression, may be assessed objectively by a variety of techniques including skeletal radiography, radionuclide scanning, computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging. Biochemical parameters or markers of skeletal metastases are not sensitive enough to detect clinically occult disease. Therapeutic interventions for bone metastases include local and systemic therapies. Surgery and radiation therapy are most frequently used for relief of pain or impending fracture, or when bone fracture or neurologic compromise has already developed. Systemic treatment of bone metastases appears to be as effective as systemic treatment of other metastatic sites. Both hormone and chemotherapy may provide significant palliation. Clinical research suggests that the adjunctive use of bisphosphonates may significantly reduce the incidence of skeletal-related morbid events associated with osteolytic bone disease. Future research efforts directed at determining the osteotrophic factors responsible for bone metastases in breast cancer, the pathophysiology of the bone remodeling process in metastatic disease and the prophylactic use of bisphosphonates may lead to significant clinical benefit for those in whom bone metastases from breast cancer develop."

Norris Cancer Center at The University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles, California between 1984 and 1987, 19 consecutive patients with cervical metastatic disease were identified and followed until death or remission. Prostate, breast, and lung neoplasms accounted for 57% of the cervical metastases. Associated nonspinal skeletal, extraskeletal, or multiple-level spinal metastases were seen in 95% of patients. Mean time from diagnosis of primary tumor to cervical metastasis was 29 months and mean survival after that was 14.7 months. Pain was the initial symptom in 89% of cases. No patient had neurologic deficit and three (16%) had slight radiographic collapse and deformity. Only one (5%) patient had documented instability. All patients had nonoperative treatment with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination. Irrespective, the pain recurred in all patients by 6 months. Nonoperative treatment may be appropriate in the absence of significant neurologic deficit or instability. The return of symptoms by 6 months warrants alternative modes of therapy."

Fourteen children had recurrent progressive disease at entry on study. Prior treatment consisted of surgical resection alone (6), surgical resection and irradiation (4), surgical resection, irradiation and chemotherapy (2), surgery and chemotherapy (1), and irradiation and chemotherapy (1). Six patients were treated at initial diagnosis of LGA because they were less than 5 years old (5) or for a second primary tumor (1). Four recurrent patients and 3 newly diagnosed patients underwent surgical debulking of their tumors immediately prior to study entry. Tumors were located in the optic nerve/chiasm/hypothalamus (8), brain stem/cerebellum (4), cerebral hemispheres (3), midline structures (3), and spinal cord (2). The treatment plan administered in an out-patient setting consisted of weekly VCR 1.5 mg/m2 for 7 to 8 weeks and VP-16 100 mg/m2 for 5 days repeated every 6 weeks for a total of 18 months of therapy. Responses were evaluated by computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Of the 20 patients, 1 exhibited a partial response maintained for 12+ months, 3 exhibited minor responses maintained for a period of 10+ to 35 months, and 11 maintained stable disease for 10 to 42 months. Of the 11 patients with stable disease, 2 were withdrawn early from the study without further therapy.

CD008686,0,1407465,0,Spinal epidural angiolipoma: rare or unreported?,"Three cases of spinal epidural angiolipoma, all affecting middle-aged women, are reported. Spinal epidural angiolipomas are considered a separate entity from the more common lipomas involving the same space. Although these tumors are considered very rare, the occurrence of three cases in less than 2 years in the same geographical area raises the question of their frequency. The computed tomographic scan has been misleading in two of our patients, whereas magnetic resonance imaging was highly suggestive. Two of these tumors were apparently exceptional, being lumbar and anterior. The patients were admitted with typical sciatic symptoms; one tumor eroded the vertebral body. Spinal epidural angiolipomas may go unreported because their pathogenetic potential is not fully recognized. We suggest that both magnetic resonance imaging and the operating microscope should have a more significant place in the evaluation and treatment of sciatica."

Effective control of the pain was achieved in nearly all patients; in only two patients was the use of the DDS discarded because of relative ineffectiveness. Fifty-three manual drug release systems (41 lumbar, 12 ventricular) and 26 lumbar ports were used. Forty patients survived more than 2 months; the maximum survival time was 560 days (mean survival time, 80 days with a port system, 100 days with a manual DDS). Patients still alive at the time of this study, i.e., with unknown survival time, were excluded. The initial mean daily dose was 8.5 mg in lumbar ports, 2.75 mg in lumbar DDS, and 0.2 mg with intraventricular application. Dose change patterns disclosed no alteration of the initial dose in 18 of 26 port patients, an initial increase in 4, a preterminal increase in 3, and a single intermittent increase in 1 patient. Of 40 lumbar DDS patients, 13 showed a constant dose, 9 an initial, 3 a preterminal, and 5 an intermittent increase. Three patients with less than 2 months' survival time had a rather continuous increase. All long-time survivors (i.e., with more than 2 months' survival time) reached a plateau and remained there until a preterminal if any increase occurred. These findings suggest the morphine dosage to be indicative of the progress of the disease rather than of a drug tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008686,0,1408067,0,[Clinical aspects and management of a retroperitoneal abscess].,"14 patients with retroperitoneal abscess have been collected by the authors since June 1, 1988. The retroperitoneal abscess of multifactorial origin can be considered as a secondary disease. The physical clinical signs (e.g. psoas rigidity sign, palpable mass, costolumbal sensitivity) play central role in setting up of diagnosis, and these signs were present in more than 75% of the cases. The physical signs generally indicate advanced retroperitoneal abscess, and at the same time the contour of psoas muscle disappears and concavity of lumbal vertebras can be seen on plane abdominal X ray film. The exact diagnosis was achieved in mean 45 days after the on set of complaints, this fact urges, that the up-to-date imaging modalities (US, CT, NMR) should be applied earlier in septic conditions of unknown origin. Retroperitoneal surgical intervention was performed in their patients, in the future the percutaneous drainage procedure has to be considered as first intervention for retroperitoneal abscess. Retroperitoneal abscess secondary to malignant disease has unfavorable prognosis, 2 out of 14 patients with retroperitoneal abscess died, both of them had underlying malignancy."

For reconstruction, a titanium cylinder was inserted after spondylectomy and augmented with an anterior plate. The titanium implant can easily be adjusted to the length needed without necessitating expensive additional equipment. Outside the patient the implant is filled with polymethylmetacrylate, facilitating plate transfixation for rotational locking. There was a 30-day mortality of 9.7%. Pain relief was apparent in 38 of 41 patients (92.7%), and motor improvement was manifest in 31 of 35 cases (88.6%). Six patients did not present with any neurological symptoms pre- or postoperatively. Neurological deterioration was registered in only 1 case (2.4%). Surgical efficacy was maintained until the death of the patients. Though tumor recurrence at a different spinal level led to consecutive surgery in 5 patients, no implant dislocation occurred during the observation period (maximum 44 months), characterizing the procedure as a mechanically reliable and safe technique."
CD008686,0,1506881,0,Adult intramedullary astrocytomas of the spinal cord.,"In this series, 25 adult patients with intramedullary astrocytomas were treated by radical excision alone. Six patients proved to have anaplastic astrocytoma; five of them died within approximately 2 years and the sixth has demonstrated disease progression. The other 19 patients were diagnosed as having low-grade astrocytoma (16 cases) or ganglioglioma (three cases); two of these had advanced preoperative neurological disability and died of medical complications. Fifteen of the remaining 17 patients have no clinical evidence of tumor recurrence after a mean follow-up period of 50.2 months; the other two have a small residual neoplasm that demonstrates no progression. Of these 17 patients, seven had previously received radiation therapy, but had clear evidence of tumor growth subsequently. This experience suggests that surgery is not beneficial for anaplastic spinal astrocytoma. However, in cases of low-grade tumor, radical excision is associated with minimal morbidity and an excellent long-term prognosis when carried out before significant disability occurs."
CD008686,0,1469464,0,Childhood brain tumors that occupy more than one compartment at presentation. Multiple compartment tumors.,"Children whose brain tumor involves two or more compartments at presentation differ clinically and pathologically from children whose brain tumor is confined to one compartment. In this study of 3,291 children with a brain tumor, at least 10% had a tumor that occupied two or three compartments at first hospitalization. Infratentorial tumors occupying multiple compartments were 1.7 times more likely to involve the cervicomedullary junction than the mesodiencephalic junction. Younger children (1-3 years) were more likely to have had multiple compartment tumors than older children. Children whose tumor was limited to the infratentorial compartment had a longer survival than children whose tumor also occupied other compartments. Ependymoma, anaplastic ependymoma, and astrocytoma (nos) were over represented among infratentorial multiple compartment tumors. Pilocytic astrocytoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor (medulloblastoma), and desmoplastic medulloblastoma were less likely to have occupied multiple compartments at the time of the first surgical exploration. The distributions of histologic features in tumors at the cervicomedullary junction differed from those in tumors limited to the posterior fossa or to the spinal canal. Seizures were more likely if the tumor was confined to the supratentorial compartment, whereas nausea or vomiting and headache were more likely if the tumor was confined to the infratentorial compartment. Children whose tumor was confined to the spinal canal were significantly more likely to have bladder symptoms and back and/or abdominal pain than those whose tumor also involved compartments above the foramen magnum. We conclude that brain tumors apparently confined to one compartment at presentation are biologically and structurally different from tumors evident in two or more compartments."
CD008686,0,1436363,0,Clinical features of intradural neurinomas in the cauda equina and around the conus medullaris.,"In this contribution the clinical features of eleven patients suffering from a neurinoma in the cauda equina and around the conus medullaris are analysed. Because of the relative mobility of the roots and the wide space in the spinal canal, tumours arising in the cauda equina or around the conus medullaris can become larger than any other spinal tumours. Lumbago was the predominant symptom as the initial complaint. Nocturnal pain relieved by walking was noticed in one patient. Two cases showed spontaneous remission and relapse. Multiple tumours were found in 6 cases (55%). Macroscopic cyst formation was found in 5 cases (45%). Among the eleven patients, total removal of the tumour, including the involved root, was performed in ten. The numbers of the resected nerve roots were one root in 6 cases, two roots in 2, and three roots in 2. Only one patient showed postoperative slight weakness of the leg."

CD008686,0,1642346,0,Intrathecal clonidine as a sole analgesic for pain relief after cesarean section.,"In a small number of studies and isolated case reports, intrathecally administered clonidine has been reported to relieve intractable cancer pain and to prolong spinal anesthesia induced by various local anesthetics. A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in order to evaluate the effect of intrathecal clonidine on pain following cesarean section. Twenty patients who underwent elective cesarean section received, 45 min after general anesthesia, either 150 micrograms (n = 10) clonidine or saline (control group, n = 10) intrathecally. Pain scores were lower in clonidine- than saline-treated patients from 20 to 120 min after intrathecal injection, as measured by a visual pain linear analog scale (P less than 0.05). Pain relief, in terms of the first supplemental analgesic request by patients, lasted 414 +/- 128 min after intrathecal clonidine and 181 +/- 169 min (mean +/- SD) (P less than 0.01) after saline. Clonidine decreased systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures compared to baseline values (P less than 0.05), but heart rate and central venous pressure were unaffected (difference not significant). Maximal reduction of systolic arterial pressure was 15 +/- 9%, of diastolic arterial pressure 22 +/- 12%, and of mean arterial pressure 18 +/- 12%. Clonidine did not affect arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation or PaCO2. Patients in the clonidine group were significantly more sedated (P less than 0.05) and more frequently reported a dry mouth (P less than 0.01) compared to the normal saline group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,1445104,0,The perivertebral collar--a new sign in lymphoproliferative malignancies.,"Nine patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies, one of whom had not been previously diagnosed, were found on CT examination for back pain to have partial or complete soft tissue perivertebral collars. The thoracic and or lumbar regions were involved in all. Only 3 had gross bony changes at the time, and in others the changes appeared so innocuous that in combination with the vague clinical symptoms their significance was underestimated. Five patients ultimately had episodes of cord compression, and in all nine the appearance of this spinal lesion appeared to be of grave prognostic significance. All 9 were dead within 1 year of the presentation of their spinal lesions. The observation of a perivertebral collar in the context of a known or suspected lymphoproliferative malignancy should therefore raise the strong suspicion of spinal involvement. The vertebrae should be examined on bone windows and the contents of the spinal canal on narrow windows to assess bony and epidural spread."

CD008686,0,1507723,0,[Implantation of self-contained non-inflatable penile prosthesis in patients with organic impotence].,"Between April, 1988 and August, 1990, the OmniPhase penile prosthesis, a non-inflatable self-contained penile prosthesis, was implanted in 34 patients, aged from 37 years to 79 years, averaging 54.2 years. The etiologies of the impotence were radical surgery for bladder cancer or rectal cancer in 17 patients, diabetes mellitus in 7 patients, vascular abnormality in 3 patients, spinal injury in 2 patients, penile disorders in 2 patients and others in 3 patients. Penile prosthesis was implanted by subcoronal incision under spinal or general anesthesia. Clinical results were evaluated 12 weeks after surgery. Thirty-two patients (94.1%) could have intercourse postoperatively. Eighteen patients (52.9%) were completely satisfied and 14 patients (41.2%) were satisfied, whereas one patient (2.9%) had no improvement and another patient (2.9%) deteriorated. There was no serious complication. However, prosthesis was explanted because of skin erosion in one patient. Pain, which lasted for more than 10 days, was seen in 3 patients (8.8%), penile edema in 11 patients (32.4%), and acute epididymitis in one patient. The obtained results showed that implantation of OmniPhase penile prosthesis is a safe and useful procedure for treatment of organic impotence."
CD008686,0,1396616,0,Multiple myeloma in Ethiopians: analysis of 22 cases.,"Twenty-two cases of multiple myeloma were seen in the Department of Internal Medicine, Tikur Anbessa (Black Lion) Hospital, a teaching and referral hospital in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, from January 1983 to December 1990. The age range was 38 to 76 (mean +/- SD = 51.5 +/- 12.2) years; a third were in the fifth decade. The male:female ratio was 1.75:1. The common clinical findings were bone pain in 20 (91%), bone tenderness in 15 (68%), anaemia in 14 (64%) and spinal cord compression in 8 (36%). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was raised in 21. Serum protein was raised in 17 (77%) and hyperglobulinaemia was seen in 20 (91%). Serum uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and calcium were elevated in 10, 8 and 5 patients respectively, Bence-Jones proteinuria and albuminuria were each found in 9 patients. All patients had radiological abnormalities; 9 had a combination of lytic lesions, osteoporosis and pathological fractures (41%). Ten patients presented in clinical stage III. Four patients are being followed after 3-84 (median 40.5) months; eight were lost to follow-up 1-8 (median 2.0) months after diagnosis. Ten patients have died after 1-55 (median 11) months. Multiple myeloma is not uncommon in Ethiopians. Except for a lower age at presentation, the clinical, haematological, biochemical, and radiological findings, and the response to therapy, are similar to those reported elsewhere."
CD008686,0,1328741,0,[Lung cancer simulating dissecting aneurysm of the aorta].,"The report analyzes a rare case of lung cancer presenting as a dissecting aortic aneurysm. A 59-year-old patient was admitted to the Department of Cardiosurgery of the Institute of Cardiology, Poznań Medical School, with a preliminary diagnosis of dissecting aneurysm of ascending aorta. The patient had hypertension treated for 5 years and 3 year history of retrosternal pains. He had smoked 20 cigarettes daily for 20 years. On admission a strong chest pain radiating into the ++inter-scapular region was reported. After two days the radiation extended into the lumbosacral area. Blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg. After 7 days paresis of the lower extremities occurred. Ecg showed only hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Chest X-ray revealed dilatation of the mediastinum and enlargement of the lungs, without focal changes. Echo (M + 2D + Doppler) suggested aortic wall dissection in the ascending part and the arch. The DSA examination did not reveal the dissection, which in turn suggested mediastinal tumor. TC presented an extensive infiltration of the upper-medial part of the right lung and invaded right mediastinum. The final diagnosis, oat cell carcinoma, was established after the histopathological analysis of a biopsy specimen taken in the course of bronchoscopy. The patient died at home after two months of oncological treatment. Autopsy was not performed. In spite of considerable progress of the diagnostic technics both dissecting aortic aneurysm and lung cancer still present a very difficult clinical problem."
CD008686,0,20054947,0,Metastatic spinal tumours: survival after surgery.,"Survival analysis of 70 patients with metastatic extradural tumours of the spine is presented. The indication for surgery was rapidly progressive cord compression as a initial manifestation of a malignant disease in 28 cases (40%), a preoperatively known malignant tumour in 28 patients (40%), relapse of cord compression after previous successful radiotherapy in 10 cases (14%), instability in 3 patients (4%) and uncontrolled pain in 1 patient. In 53 procedures (76%) the level of compression was in the thoracic spine, in 9 procedures in the cervical spine (13%) and in 8 procedures in the lumbar spine (11%). All patients had developed a neural deficit before surgery. Fourteen patients (20%) were able to walk prior to surgery, 47 (67%) were paraparetic, and 9 (13%) were paraplegic. Eleven patients died in the first 2 weeks following surgery and out of 59 patients who survived, 39 patients (66%) were able to walk, 11 were paraparetic (19%), and 9 were still paraplegic (15%). Bowel and bladder dysfunction was present in 37 cases (53%) before surgery and in 16 cases (27%) after surgery. Normal sphincter control was regained after 43 (73%) procedures. Persistent back pain was present in 60 patients (86%) before surgery and in 13 patients (22%) after surgery. The mean survival time for all 70 patients was 45.6 weeks. There were 11 early deaths (16%), another 51 patients died from disseminated disease (88%), and 8 patients are still alive (11%) with a mean survival of 133 weeks. A statistically significantly shorter survival was found in patients with lung metastases when compared with the survival of patients with breast metastases and the overall survival of patients with other metastatic tumours."
CD008686,0,18415614,0,[Prevalence and characteristics of neuropathic pain in malignant disease.].,"Neuropathic pain is one of the problem areas in the management of cancer pain. In a retrospective study, prevalence and characteristics of neuropathic pain in 1318 cancer patients attending a pain clinic were examined. Of the patients, 135 suffered from neuropathic, 285 from neuropathic and nociceptive, 890 from nociceptive and 8 from unknown pain conditions. Among the patients with neuropathic pain 62% rated the pain intensity as very sincere; this was so in 48% of those with nociceptive pain. Neuropathic pain was caused by direct tumour involvement (nerve compression or infiltration) in 71%, by oncological treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation) in 15%, by debilitating disease (e.g. herpes zoster) in 6% and by factors unrelated to cancer or its treatment in 8% of the patients. Of 110 clinically analysed neuropathic pain conditions, 44% were neuralgic, 31% radicular, 13% sympathically maintained, and 10% caused by deafferentiation, while in 3% the nature was unknown. To evaluate the efficacy of cancer pain treatment, nocicepetive pain has to be differentiated from neuropathic pain. In addition to this, neuropathic pain has to be divided into subgroups."
CD008686,0,1606380,0,Osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma of the spine.,"Eleven patients with spinal osteoid osteoma and six patients with spinal osteoblastoma treated between 1975 and 1990 were reviewed to characterize the tumors as they affect the spine and to define the important differences between the two tumors. All patients with cervical osteoid osteoma presented with pain, limited range of motion of the neck, and torticollis. Four osteoblastomas had soft-tissue components in the epidural space, necessitating dissection of the tumor from the dura. No soft-tissue component was found in any of the osteoid osteomas. Our results were similar to a metaanalysis of the clinical, radiographic, and surgical findings of all published cases of spinal osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma. Important features that have not been emphasized in the literature are the high incidence of torticollis with cervical lesions and the frequent association of epidural invasion with osteoblastoma. Surgeons treating osteoblastoma of the spine should be prepared to dissect tumor from the dura."

CD008686,0,1563167,0,Osteoblastoma of the spine.,"Osteoid osteomas and osteoblastomas have similar histologic characteristics, although their clinical course in the spine may be significantly different. At the authors' institution, spinal osteoblastomas constituted 46% (30/65) of all osteoblastomas treated. Sixteen of the lesions occurred in the lumbar spine (53%), eight in the thoracic spine, and six in the cervical spine. In all regions of the spine, the posterior elements and pedicles were more frequently involved than the vertebral body. Twenty patients had pain or other symptoms for more than 12 months before diagnosis. Six of eight patients had thoracic lesions that demonstrated neurologic involvement. Twelve patients presented with painful scoliosis. Fourteen patients had lesions with well-circumscribed margins confined within the vertebral structure (Enneking Stage 2), and 16 had ill-defined margins with soft-tissue extension (Enneking Stage 3). Well-defined lesions were treated with curettage, with excellent results in 12 of 14 patients. The more extensive lesions were treated by intralesional excision (15/16) and adjuvant radiation therapy (9/16)."
CD008686,0,1533172,0,Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody treatment of patients with CD3-negative tumors: a phase IA/B study.,"Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies induce the proliferation of human T-cells in vitro and activate specific and nonspecific cytolysis by human T-cell clones and human peripheral blood lymphocytes. In vivo administration of anti-CD3 prevents tumor growth of a UV-induced mouse fibrosarcoma. We conducted a phase I trial to determine the toxicity and immunomodulatory properties of low doses of anti-CD3 in 36 patients with cancer. In 23 patients, anti-CD3 was given i.v. over 3 h at 1, 10, 30, and 100 mcg/patient. Five other patients received anti-CD3 at 30 mcg by i.v. bolus. Patients were treated every 3 days for a total of four doses. An additional eight patients received anti-CD3 daily for 14 days at 3 mcg by i.v. bolus, 3-h infusion, or 24-h infusion. Dose-limiting toxicity was headache. Headache was often accompanied by signs and symptoms of meningeal irritation leading to performance of a lumbar puncture in nine patients. The opening pressure was usually elevated, and six patients had a cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis with an elevated protein. Increased levels of interleukin 6 were identified in the cerebrospinal fluid. The maximum tolerated dose by 3-h infusion was 30 mcg. There were no objective tumor responses. There was a dose-related increase in the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes expressing the T-cell activation antigen CD69 (Leu 23), but no changes were seen in CD25 (interleukin 2 receptor) expression, and no changes were observed in the serum levels of the soluble interleukin 2 receptor. Even at these low doses of anti-CD3, 8 of 16 patients tested developed human anti-mouse antibodies."
CD008686,0,1320441,0,Spinal cord compression in prostate cancer. A 10-year experience.,"Of 478 patients treated at a single institution for prostate cancer, 29 developed spinal cord or cauda equina compression. In 5 patients, spinal cord compression was the first evidence of malignancy. Clinical features were predominantly pain, weakness, sensory and sphincter disturbance. The median duration of symptoms was 2 weeks, although the diagnosis was made rapidly at presentation. Clinical diagnosis correlated well with myelographic findings. Only 1 patient suffered neurological deterioration as a consequence of myelography. The functional outcome was dependent on the ability to walk prior to treatment. The median survival in those who were bedridden following treatment was 6 weeks (range 3.5-13) and 21 weeks (range 7-110+) in those who were ambulant following therapy."
CD008686,0,1315407,0,Bone metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver resection.,"Between January 1985 and July 1990, 323 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma underwent liver resection in our department. Bone metastases were found in 12 of these cases (3.7%). Bone metastases were mainly found in vertebral bone (58.3%) and pelvic bone (41.7%). The time interval to the development of bone metastasis after liver resection was closely related to the presence of intrahepatic metastasis and the stage at operation. In all cases, the initial clinical symptom was pain and/or motor disturbance. Radiotherapy was performed in 10 cases and transcatheter arterial embolization or surgery was performed in 4 cases. The pain or neurological symptoms improved with these therapies in all cases. Cumulative survival was 1 year in 74%, 2 years in 34%, and 3 years in 17%, respectively."
CD008686,0,1594470,0,The use of distraction and imagery with children during painful procedures.,"The effectiveness of a pediatric pain management program was examined using a multiple case study design. This study examined both the children's pain experience during cancer treatment, as well as their parents' anxiety and behavioral stress. Fourteen children were videotaped while receiving lumbar punctures during an 8-12 month period. Baseline data were obtained at the first of three visits prior to the introduction of relaxation, imagery, and distraction exercises. Self-ratings of child fear and parent anxiety, videotaped observations of child and parent behavior, and child pain ratings were obtained at all three visits. The children's behavioral responses to the procedure varied considerably, but their fear scores were stable and their reports of pain decreased over time. Parents reported high-trait, low-state anxiety scores that were stable over time. They were observed to be very supportive during the procedures. Implications for further research in this area and recommendations for practice are presented."
CD008686,0,1594275,0,Octreotide: a potent new non-opiate analgesic for intrathecal infusion.,"Somatostatin-14 has been reported to relieve severe cancer pain when given intraspinally. We have studied a stable analog, octreotide, which is suitable for long-term infusion by a drug pump. In preclinical trials in dogs, chronic intrathecal and intraventricular perfusion at 40 micrograms/h did not produce neurotoxicity. On the basis of these findings cancer patients with pain unrelieved by oral opiates were treated for periods of 13 to 91 days with intrathecal octreotide 5-20 micrograms/h. During octreotide infusion, pain scores were lower while oral opiate usage was reduced. No central or systemic side effects of intrathecal administration were seen. The pain relief occurred in patients who had previously not obtained satisfactory pain control with systemic or intrathecal opiates, which is consistent with a non-opiate spinal pathway. These preliminary findings, if confirmed, suggest that octreotide is a potent non-opiate analgesic appropriate for long-term intrathecal infusion."
CD008686,0,1574769,0,"Therapy monitoring of presacral recurrences after high-dose irradiation: value of PET, CT, CEA and pain score.","21 patients were followed by positron-emission-tomography (PET) FDG (18Flourdeoxyglucose) uptake, physical examination, CT and CEA levels after combined photon-neutron irradiation for inoperable recurrent rectal carcinoma. In order to evaluate the response to radiotherapy symptomatic relief, CEA levels, decrease of tumor volume measured by CT analysis were correlated with the FDG-uptake. The objective of this study was also to investigate if the level of FDG-uptake prior to radiotherapy or the early decrease after therapy can be used as a prognostic factor. Prior to radiotherapy sacral pain was the predominant symptom. All malignancies showed measurable tumor masses, evaluation of CEA levels and enhanced tracer accumulation of FDG in the PET cross section. The mean FDG-uptake before radiotherapy was 2.3 +/- 1.1 (range 1.1 to 5.0) in 21 patients in contrast to 1.9 +/- 0.7 (range 0.8 bis 4.0) three months after radiotherapy. In six patients FDG concentration values decreased to the range of normal soft tissue, moreover, two of them relapsed after six and 22 months. Elevated FDG-uptake of the sacral bone was noted in PET cross sections in two patients, while there was no evidence of osseous alterations in CT. Normal levels of CEA were achieved in 14 patients and complete or partial pain relief in 20 of 21 patients. A decrease of tumor volume of more than 50% was detected in the follow-up CT scans of three patients but no complete remission was found. The result suggests that enhanced glucose uptake is associated with recurrent rectal cancer. However, enhanced glycolytic activity is related not only to malignant cells but also to all proliferating cells. To distinguish between proliferation, repair, inflammation, and residual viable tumor cells is not possible and may be responsible for an unchanged or elevated FDG-uptake after radiotherapy."
CD008686,0,1557241,0,Midazolam versus fentanyl as premedication for painful procedures in children with cancer.,"Premedication for painful procedures in children with cancer is not routinely used. Many medications used are only intermittently effective or require special equipment or anesthesia support. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, the safety and efficacy of midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, were compared with the safety and efficacy of fentanyl, a short-acting narcotic analgesic. In 25 children studied, 100% of children and their parents preferred study drugs to any previous premedication. Seventy-two percent preferred midazolam to fentanyl. Preprocedural anxiety, adverse behavioral symptoms, and visual analog scales all improved and side effects were minimal. It is concluded that premedication for painful procedures should be used routinely in children with cancer. With proper monitoring, fentanyl and midazolam can be used safely in the outpatient clinic setting. Midazolam was found to be the drug of preference for the majority of patients."
CD008686,0,1533356,0,Increased sacroiliac joint uptake after lumbar fusion and/or laminectomy.,"Of 753 adult patients undergoing SPECT and planar bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of low back pain, 43 (6%) showed either unilateral or bilateral increased sacroiliac joint (SIJ) uptake. Five of the 58 abnormal joints were only identified with SPECT (9%), whereas 20 of the 58 abnormal joints were much more convincingly demonstrated by SPECT (34%). Fifteen of the 43 patients with increased SIJ uptake had undergone prior lumbar laminectomy and/or spinal fusion. Such spinal surgery can increase impact loading on the SIJ, leading to mechanical overload and sacroiliitis. Degenerative joint disease, trauma, or other benign pathology accounted for the remaining patients with increased SIJ uptake. The authors conclude that for patients with a history of lumbar spinal fusion and/or laminectomy, increased SIJ uptake usually is caused by altered spinal mechanics rather than malignancy or infection."

CD008686,0,1374853,0,Treatment options in primary Ewing's sarcoma of the spine: report of seven cases and review of the literature.,"Primary Ewing's sarcoma of the spine is reviewed, and seven cases are presented. Ewing's sarcoma of the spine is a rare condition that appears with a clinical triad of local pain, neurological deficit, and a palpable mass. The clinical picture, imaging characteristics, and management are discussed. The definitive management of Ewing's sarcoma of the spine, as in other locations, could include three main modalities: surgery, radiotherapy, and combination chemotherapy. In the presence of acute neurological decompensation, decompressive surgery via an appropriate approach should be performed. Because Ewing's sarcoma is usually sensitive to chemotherapy, initial chemotherapy, in neurologically stable patients, could be attempted first without surgical resection. Further management could then be gauged according to the response."
CD008686,0,1637135,0,The spectrum of neurological disease in patients with systemic cancer.,"To ascertain the range of neurological problems in patients with systemic cancer, we prospectively evaluated neurological symptoms, neurological diagnoses, and primary tumors in all patients with a history of systemic cancer examined by the Department of Neurology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, from Jul 1, 1990, to Dec 31, 1990. Of the 815 patients seen for neurological symptoms, less than half (45.2%) had metastatic involvement of the nervous system. The three most common symptoms were back pain (18.2%), altered mental status (17.1%), and headache (15.4%). The most common neurological diagnosis was brain metastasis (15.9%), followed by metabolic encephalopathy (10.2%), pain associated with bone metastases only (9.9%), and epidural extension or metastasis of tumor (8.4%). Of 133 patients with undiagnosed back or neck pain, 44 (33%) had epidural extension or metastases from tumor and 40 (30%) had pain associated with vertebral metastases only. In 15 (11%) the cause for the back pain was unrelated to metastatic disease. Of 132 patients seen on initial consultation for altered mental status, metabolic encephalopathy was the major neurological diagnosis (80; 61%); 20 (15%) had intracranial metastases. Of 97 patients with undiagnosed headache, 59 (61%) had a nonstructural cause. Fifty-three of these patients had either migraine, tension headache, or headache related to systemic illness (e.g., fever, sepsis). These results indicate that even in patients with systemic cancer, a group particularly prone to developing neurological disease that can be diagnosed radiologically, the role of clinicians remains important in helping distinguish noncancer-related and nonmetastatic neurological problems."
CD008686,0,1618441,0,Clinical features of Balkan endemic nephropathy.,"This paper describes the clinical symptoms and signs of Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN). The initial asymptomatic period followed by weakness and lassitude during renal insufficiency is emphasized. Non-characteristic lumbar pain may be present and episodes of macrohaematuria may occur. There is no fever, no severe dysuria, and no general disease preceding the symptoms. No oedema of the nephrotic type is recognized. Working capacity is unaffected until the late stage of the disease. In the advanced stages pallor of the skin and xantochromia of palms and soles are noticeable. Blood pressure is normal, but in the advanced phase may be elevated. In the uraemic phase a full uraemic syndrome is found. Urothelial tumours are frequent, occurring in 2-47% of cases; tumour cells may be found in the urine. Proteinuria of tubular type may be found early; in the uraemic phase it is constant. In the urinary sediment there are scarce white and red blood cells (the latter episodically abundant). Bacteriuria is present in about 20% of women patients. Glucosuria (less than 10%) and aminoaciduria (less than 10%) have been reported. In the early stages of BEN the urine concentration capacity is impaired earlier than renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Enzymuria is present in the early phases. Tamm-Horsfall protein may be increased in the urine. Normo- or hypochromic normocytic hyporegenerative anaemia is a frequent finding. Bone marrow and leucocytes are normal. Serum proteins and immunoglobulins are not altered. Complement is normal; anti-glomerular basal membrane and anti-tubular basal membrane are negative. On radiography, kidney size varies from normal to the size of a small contracted kidney. The clinical picture of the disease is that of a slowly progressing tubulo-interstitial chronic nephritis."

CD008686,0,1315382,0,Lymphoma-induced polyradiculopathy in AIDS: two cases.,"Progressive polyradiculopathy is a rare, well-documented complication of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in man. It has been commonly attributed to a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. We report two HIV-infected patients with clinical and electrophysiological features of a unique, subacute, progressive polyradiculopathy. Post-mortem examination in case 1 disclosed an infiltration of the leptomeninges, the lumbar spinal cord, and the anterior and posterior roots by a B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma. Immunochemistry for HIV1 and CMV was negative in the peripheral and the central nervous system. Case 2 showed bone-marrow involvement by a Burkitt type lymphoma. Specific chemotherapy was followed by both clinical improvement of the polyradiculopathy and complete remission on a second bone-marrow biopsy. These findings may indicate that a lymphoma must also be considered a possible cause of polyradiculopathy in AIDS."
CD008686,0,1312260,0,Radiotherapeutic palliation of spinal epidural compression in small-cell lung cancer.,"Sixteen patients with spinal epidural compression by metastatic small-cell lung cancer were given radiotherapy for palliation. Lower limb motor deficit was the most prominent clinical manifestation. Neurologic dysfunction was commonly present for more than 48 hours before the diagnosis of compression. Median interval between diagnosis of lung cancer and epidural tumor was 8.5 months. Twelve percent of the patients survived for 1 year after diagnosis of epidural compression. Radiotherapy gave significant pain relief to eight (89%) of the symptomatic individuals. Among those whose status could be assessed, one third of the initially nonambulatory patients (n = 9) were able to walk again. Anal or bladder sphincter or sensory disturbance did not improve in four persons. Radiotherapy for spinal epidural compression in small-cell lung cancer, though not curative, is highly effective in the relief of pain and may ameliorate limb motor dysfunction in some patients."
CD008686,0,1736693,0,Neuropathologic findings after long-term intrathecal infusion of morphine and bupivacaine for pain treatment in cancer patients.,"Epidural or intrathecal infusions of morphine and bupivacaine mixtures are presently used for the treatment of ""refractory"" cancer pain even though the neurotoxic potential of such mixtures is unknown. The pathologic findings of the spinal column, the meninges, the nerve roots, and the spinal cord, and the clinical neurologic deficits were recorded in 15 patients (5 men and 10 women), aged 26-83 (median 68) yr, treated for 4-274 (median 81) days with intrathecal infusions of morphine (with preservatives [sodium metabisulfite and sodium edetate]) and bupivacaine mixtures, given through open, subcutaneously tunneled nylon catheters. Six patients had been subjected to radiation therapy (20-96 Gy), applied over the spinal column, and four had been treated with antineoplastics believed to be neurotoxic. Ten patients had various neurologic deficits before the intrathecal treatment. The cumulative doses (ranges) given intrathecally were: morphine 33-11,900 mg, sodium metabisulfite 3.3-1,050 mg, sodium edetate 0.33-105 mg, and bupivacaine 10-41,400 mg; cumulative volumes were 16-9,400 ml. The concentrations of the drugs in the mixtures were: morphine 0.25-4.0 mg/ml, sodium metabisulfite 0.025-0.40 mg/ml, sodium edetate 0.0025-0.04 mg/ml, and bupivacaine 3.0-4.75 mg/ml. The osmolality of the mixtures in vitro ranged from 282 to 286 mOsm/kg and the pH from 4.1 to 4.6. The pathologic findings consisted of vertebral metastases (n = 6), epidural and/or intrathecal tumor masses (n = 8), focal subdural fibrosis (n = 6), infiltration of mononuclear cells in the subarachnoid space (n = 10), and discrete injuries (nerve fiber degeneration or fibrosis) to the anterior (five patients) and posterior (seven) nerve roots, and spinal cord (tumor compression [one], slight thickening of the leptomeninges [one], and thrombosis of a spinal artery and medullary infarction [one]). In none of the cases was any reaction against the nylon catheter within its subarachnoid course recorded. The neuropathologic findings were not related to the duration or cumulative doses of the intrathecal treatment. No new neurologic deficits that could be attributed to the intrathecal administration of the opiate-bupivacaine mixtures were recorded. The neuropathologic and clinical neurologic findings in cancer patients treated with intrathecal morphine-bupivacaine mixtures appeared similar to those in animals and humans reported with either intrathecal morphine or bupivacaine alone."
CD008686,0,1732956,0,Percutaneous drainage of tubo-ovarian abscesses.,"The authors performed percutaneous drainage of 27 tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOAs) in 16 patients in whom medical therapy with triple antibiotics prior to catheter drainage had not been successful. Percutaneous drainage was successful in 15 of 16 patients (94%). One patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 3 days after catheter placement because of persistent symptoms and lack of drainage from the catheter; at laparotomy, a large infected phlegmon was found. Two patients had recurrent disease at 3 and 4 months after catheter placement. Bilateral salpingectomy was performed in one patient and total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in the other. One of these patients had cervical carcinoma, and the other had a long history of recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease and TOAs. The long-term avoidance of surgery was 81.2%. Access routes for catheter drainage were through the anterior abdominal wall for 10 abscesses, through the posterior transgluteal route for 11, and through the transvaginal route for six. Duration of drainage was 1-20 days (mean, 6 days). Complications consisted of transient sciatic pain in two patients and mild bacteremia in one. The results indicate that percutaneous drainage of TOAs is effective in patients in whom medical therapy is not successful."
CD008686,0,1550106,0,Severe osteopenia and vertebral compression fractures after complete remission in an adolescent with acute leukemia.,"Acute leukemia frequently presents with skeletal symptoms; however, the etiologies of bone pain and osteopenia are poorly understood. We present the case of an adolescent girl with acute leukemia who developed vertebral fractures after being in complete remission for 3 months. Bone mineral density was very low (less than 0.6 g/cm2) but remained stable during the subsequent 3 months despite continuation therapy with methotrexate and prednisone. Findings of a bone biopsy were consistent with a recent episode of aggressive bone resorption. We suggest that paracrine secretion of lymphokines may mediate loss of bone mass during the active phase of acute leukemia, although clinical bone disease may not develop until after complete remission is achieved."
CD008686,0,1738426,0,[Two cases of von Recklinghausen's disease with multiple brain and spinal tumors].,"The authors reported two cases of von Recklinghausen's disease with multiple brain tumors and multiple spinal tumors. The first case, a 21-year-old man who had a past history of optic gliomas was admitted because of gait disturbance. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed calcification of the basal ganglia, bilateral C-P angle tumors, cystic cerebellar tumor and arachnoid cyst in the quadrigeminal cistern. Myelography and MRI revealed multiple spinal tumors. Surgical management was performed and cerebellar tumor was histologically confirmed to be a pilocytic astrocytoma. Spinal tumors were also astrocytomas. The second patient, a 56-year-old woman suffered from right iliac pain, right hemiparesis and motor aphasia. CT revealed two round tumors in the left cerebral hemisphere and bilateral C-P angle tumors. Myelography and MRI demonstrated multiple intradural-extramedullary spinal tumors. Histologically, supratentorial tumors were transitional meningiomas and spinal tumors were neurinomas. It is well known that von Recklinghausen's disease is often associated with brain or spinal tumors. But, in the literature, only 22 cases of von Recklinghausen's disease combined with multiple brain tumors with different histological types and multiple spinal tumors have been reviewed. With our two cases, the average age of these 24 cases was 28.6 years old, nine cases were male and 15 cases were female. All patients had C-P angle tumors and 23 cases were combined with intracranial meningiomas. In this paper, the clinical features and diagnostic aspects were discussed."
CD008686,0,1727665,0,A pilot trial of chemohormonal therapy for metastatic prostate carcinoma.,"Fifteen patients with previously untreated metastatic prostate cancer were treated on a pilot trial with a combination of maximal androgen blockade plus intermittent cytotoxic therapy after androgen priming to stimulate cell division. Androgen blockage was carried out using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (leuprolide) plus a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (flutamide). Carboplatin (CBDCA) (800 mg/m2) was given intravenously every 28 days, preceded for 3 days and followed for 3 days by androgen treatment with fluoxymesterone (5 mg orally twice a day), during which time flutamide was discontinued. Three patients (20%) achieved a complete response (CR), and eight patients (53.3%) achieved a partial response (PR). Four patients (26.7%) had stable disease (SD). The median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 31 months. Nine of 15 patients (60%) remain alive with a median follow-up time of 42+ months (range, 22 to 54 months). Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and Grades 3 or 4 leukopenia were experienced in 87% and 80% of patients, respectively, requiring dose reductions of CBDCA in 85% of the cycles. Six of 15 patients experienced a flare in bone pain with androgen priming. There were no associated spinal cord compressions; however, exclusion of impending spinal cord compression was required before entrance on study."
CD008686,0,1605087,0,Problems related to dorsal root entry zone lesions.,"Several clinical problems related to the dorsal root entry zone lesions (DREZLs) in 15 patients with chronic pain are presented and discussed in terms of ratings of pain relief following surgery, development of sensory or motor weakness and postmortem histologies. Subjective pain relief exceeding 70% was achieved at around 2 weeks after the operations in most patients (13/15), and then decreased in some to 30 from 70% in the follow-up observations. Our new ""objective"" pain relief score was tested in these patients. A significant positive correlation between subjective pain relief and our objective pain relief scale was found, but some discrepancies between them were also found during the follow-up. Sensory loss, motor weakness, paraesthesia and a new pain were found as complications in 12, 7, 4 and 6 patients, respectively. Postmortem histological findings of the spinal cord in two patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and uterine cancer, who received bilateral DREZLs twice and bilateral DREZLs plus commissural myelotomy, respectively, indicate that care should be taken to avoid extension of the coagulation beyond the dorsal horn."
CD008686,0,1595313,0,Congenital lumbosacral lipomas presenting as a form of occult spinal dysraphism. A report of 9 surgically treated cases.,"Nine cases of congenital lumbosacral lipoma have been diagnosed and treated surgically at the Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Department of Neurosurgery during the last 16 years. Five patients were male and four female with ages ranging from 18 months to 30 years. The most frequent complaints were mass in the back (in five cases), motor weakness in the lower extremities (in five), urinary incontinence (in five), and lumbosacral hypertrichosis (in five). On neurological examination, four patients had deep tendon reflex changes, five had motor changes and four were normal. There was significant improvement in seven cases. Two had no improvement. In this report, we review nine patients retrospectively, and discuss the surgical intervention and the results achieved."
CD008686,0,1581121,0,Metastatic bone disease: clinical and therapeutic aspects.,"Breast and prostate carcinomas are the tumors most commonly associated with skeletal metastases, and the skeleton is the most common site of metastatic disease and of first distant relapse in breast cancer. Bone metastases are the source of considerable morbidity, including pain and functional disability, fractures, hypercalcemia, and epidural compression. The classical radionuclide bone scan remains the most effective tool for the screening of metastatic bone disease, but X-rays are more specific and remain the essential tool for the diagnosis and characterization of bone metastases. Computed tomography is much more useful to diagnose early metastatic involvement of bone, particularly of the spine. Patients with exclusive skeletal metastatic involvement are still frequently excluded from classical therapeutic trials because of the difficulties in the assessment of response. Recalcification of osteolytic lesions is indeed required when defining an objective response, but this criterion is insensitive and not quantitative. Moreover, the development of new osteoblastic lesions is often of difficult interpretation. A concomitant bone scan will help, but the absence of quantification of the changes and the ""flare"" phenomenon limit the usefulness of the technique. Pain and quality of life constitute simple, but frequently neglected, parameters of response to therapy. The clinical utility of tumor markers and of biochemical markers of bone turnover should also be more fully investigated. Neoplastic osteolysis is essentially mediated by the osteoclasts, which seem to be activated, maybe indirectly through the osteoblasts, by some tumor products. Various substances of tumoral origin have been proposed as mediators for this osteoclast activation, such as transforming growth factors, prostaglandins, and, more recently, products of the immune cells or parathyroid hormone-related peptide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,1485751,0,[Evaluation and treatment of chronic pain after cervicofacial cancer surgery].,"When lasting pain occurs after surgery of head and neck cancer, tumoral recurrence should be considered. In addition to curative treatment, relief of pain is often provided by opioid analgesics. Doses vary according to tolerance and patient. Other than digestive routes of administration may be required. Here are two clinical reports: the first case with cervical epidural analgesia by ambulatory autoadministration device (Patient control analgesia), the other one with intrathecal in C7-T1 catheter with port access in which morphine was injected every 24 hours resulting in efficient analgesia, in metastatic Pancoast's syndrome. Surgical or radiotherapy sequelae sometimes bring about pain; bilateral cervicalgy described as burns associated with pain-related depression, 18 months after glotto-subglottic partial laryngectomy, requires psychological support and carbamazepine for desafferation pain removed within 6 months. When the only treatment left appears to be analgesia after surgery of head and neck cancer, follow-up in a multidisciplinary pain treatment centre allows a therapeutical management with optimum tolerance and efficiency."
CD008686,0,1457373,0,The Vater association and spinal dysraphia.,"We here present a hereto previously undescribed association of occult spinal disorders of the distal spinal cord/filum in the Vater association. We present 6 patients who were diagnosed as having the Vater association who subsequently presented with occult spinal disorders, primarily lipomas of the filum/conus complex with or without subcutaneous lipomas. Uniformly the spinal cord was tethered to the lipoma/filum complex. Progressive neurological dysfunction was noted in those in whom the diagnosis was made late in the disease. The importance of neuroimaging of the distal spinal canal, in children in whom the diagnosis of the Vater association has been made, is emphasized to prevent insidious neurological damage if not already present."
CD008686,0,1449675,0,Multicentric glioma of the spinal cord.,"A 24-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis presented with a 1.5-year history of pain in the neck, both shoulders and back, and a 4-month history of progressively increasing weakness of all the limbs and inability to walk. The limb weakness fluctuated and, at the height of the weakness, it was associated with hesitancy and retention of urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a fusiform enlargement of the upper cervical cord with obliteration of the subarachnoid space. Imaging after gadolinium-DTPA injection revealed inhomogeneous enhancement extending from the lower medulla down to the C4 cord level, and homogeneous enhancement at D3 to D4 and D6 to D8 cord levels. The spinal cord at the lower two levels appeared morphologically normal. At operation the fusiform enlargement of the cervical cord was confirmed. The tumour was partially removed. Histology revealed it to be a fibrillary astrocytoma."

MRI showed diffuse hyperintensity in T2WI in the spinal cord below the T6 level. Acute transverse myelitis was diagnosed based on the clinical presentations and MRI findings. The patient had poor recovery and two months later, a follow-up MRI disclosed a severe diffuse atrophic change of the spinal cord in the affected segment."
CD008686,0,1374063,0,A review of local radiotherapy in the treatment of bone metastases and cord compression.,"Local radiotherapy plays an important role in the management of bone metastases. Because it is given with palliative intent to patients with limited, if variable, life expectancy, radiotherapy schedules need to be identified which give maximum patient benefit (short and long term) with minimum associated morbidity and minimum disruption of the patients' remaining life. For localized bone pain, a single fraction of radiotherapy, repeated if necessary, appears to fulfill these criteria in patients with a short life expectancy. There are, however, unanswered questions regarding fraction size and the adequacy of one fraction for long-term control and for all pathological tumor types. Only randomized trials can answer these questions. Uncertainties also exist regarding the precise indications for radiotherapy to prevent and treat pathological fractures and the optimal dose schedule which will provide adequate local tumor control without inhibiting bone healing or interfering with bone integrity. Because of the many variables, guidelines on selection of cases of spinal cord compression for decompression by surgery or radiotherapy are likely to be of more value than randomized prospective studies in this condition. Experimental work and clinical experience to date suggest an advantage for a few large fractions of radiotherapy, at least initially, to achieve a rapid response, but this too needs confirmation. Treatment decisions based on past teaching and local custom rather than on valid clinical trial data have led to considerable differences in clinical practice among radiotherapists. Bone metastases are common and warrant a great deal more experimental and clinical study than they have received to date."
CD008686,0,1327618,0,Generalized mastocytosis and neurological complications in a 71-year-old patient.,"A woman born in 1917 presented with recurrent urticaria since childhood. In the course of her life she developed urticaria pigmentosa, followed by generalized mastocytosis involving the bones, gastro-intestinal tract, and liver. At the age of 71 years neurological symptoms of cranial nerves necessitated hospital admission. Within a month a concomitant conus medullaris syndrome caused sphincter dysfunction and sacral sensory disturbances. No cause or secondary abnormalities were found on myelography, CT and MRI of the brain and the spinal cord, and in the CSF."
CD008686,0,1314184,0,"Spinal leptomeningeal neoplastic disease. Evaluation by MR, myelography and CT myelography.","Out of 16 patients, spinal leptomeningeal neoplastic disease was diagnosed by MRI in 4 patients, myelography in 14 patients and CT myelography in 12 cases. MR was superior to myelography in 2 patients, in another 2 patients MRI was equally diagnostic. The cerebrospinal fluid of every patient contained malignant cells. Histological evidence for primary central nervous system tumors was found in 5 cases. In 10 cases, non-neuraxial malignancy consisted of small cell carcinoma of the lung (7 cases), and leukemia and lymphoma (3 patients). In 1 patient, primary leptomeningeal malignant melanoma was confirmed at autopsy. Preferential thoracolumbar neoplastic morphologic manifestation correlated with the presence of conus and cauda equina syndrome in 9 patients, low back pain, paresthesia and spinal root signs in 7 patients. False-negative interpretation of myelography in 2 patients with positive MR findings, and the impressive sensitivity of gadolinium Dota to improve visualization of subarachnoid spread, favor MRI as an alternative imaging technique in the assessment of patients with suspected intradural extramedullary malignancy."
CD008686,0,1299778,0,[Intramedullary neurinoma. Apropos of a case. Review of the literature].,"The authors present a case of intramedullary neurinoma. A 44 years old patient was admitted for lumbar pain and bilateral sciatica. Neurological examination was normal except for dysuria and diminution of Achilles tendon reflexes. Lumbar spine X-rays and spinal cord angiogram were normal, but myelogram and myelo-scan revealed a fusiform enlargement of the conus medullaris. MRI confirmed this aspect. Total removal of an intramedullary tumor was done, using ultrasonography, operating microscope and ultrasonic aspiration. The post-operative course was uneventful, with, as sequelae a perineal hypoesthesia. Histological examination of the excised tumor revealed a neurinoma. The epidemiology, clinical features, radiology, and surgical treatment of such rare intramedullary tumors are discussed."
CD008686,0,18415178,0,[Spinal neurostimulation for the treatment of chronic pain: changes in indications and patient selection after 19 years' experience.].,"After the initial clinical reports of Shealy 1967 dorsal column stimulation (DCS) was first introduced in Germany by Krainick (Freiburg) and Winkelmüller (Hannover) in 1972. At first, the success rate in unselected patients was unsatisfactory. The results improved with careful patient selection and better technical equipment allowing preliminary testing procedures before definitive implantation. The authors' own results in 335 patients treated by intermittent spinal cord stimulation (SCS) with implanted devices between 1972 and 1989 show that long-term beneficial effects can be obtained in pain of neurogenic origin rather than in nociceptor pain. Guidelines for the use of SCS were proposed by the German Society of Neurosurgery in 1990. The best indications and target group are cases with radicular low-back pain after failed back surgery, stump and phantom pain, pain states following partial lesions of brachial/lumbar plexus and peripheral nerves, sympathetic dystrophy and rest pain in peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Possible indications for SCS are pain after incomplete lesions of spinal cord or cauda equina, postherpetic neuralgia, sclerodermia and PVD. Failures must be expected in pain states related to progressive malignant disease and complete deafferentation after spinal lesions or root avulsion."
CD008686,0,1838423,0,Low back pain in young athletes. A practical approach.,"Lumbar spine pain accounts for 5 to 8% of athletic injuries. Although back pain is not the most common injury, it is one of the most challenging for the sports physician to diagnose and treat. Factors predisposing the young athlete to back injury include the growth spurt, abrupt increases in training intensity or frequency, improper technique, unsuitable sports equipment, and leg-length inequality. Poor strength of the back extensor and abdominal musculature, and inflexibility of the lumbar spine, hamstrings and hip flexor muscles may contribute to chronic low back pain. Excessive lifting and twisting may produce sprains and strains, the most common cause of low back pain in adolescents. Blows to the spine may create contusions or fractures. Fractures in adolescents from severe trauma include compression fracture, comminuted fracture, fracture of the growth plate at the vertebral end plate, lumbar transverse process fracture, and a fracture of the spinous process. Athletes who participate in sports involving repeated and forceful hyperextension of the spine may suffer from lumbar facet syndrome, spondylolysis, or spondylolisthesis. The large sacroiliac joint is also prone to irritation. The signs and symptoms of disc herniation in adolescents may be more subtle than in adults. Disorders simulating athletic injury include tumours and inflammatory connective tissue disease. Often, however, a specific diagnosis cannot be made in the young athlete with a low back injury due to the lack of pain localisation and the anatomic complexity of the lumbar spine. A thorough history and physical examination are usually more productive in determining a diagnosis and guiding treatment than imaging techniques. Diagnostic tests may be considered, though, for the adolescent athlete whose back pain is severe, was caused by acute trauma, or fails to improve with conservative therapy after several weeks. Radiographs, bone scanning, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging may help identify, or exclude serious pathology. Fortunately, the majority of cases of low back pain in adolescents respond to conservative therapy. Immediate treatment of an acute injury, such as a sprain or strain, includes cryotherapy, electrogalvanic stimulation, anti-inflammatory medications and gentle exercises. Prolonged bed rest should be avoided since atrophy may occur rapidly. Strong analgesics are also usually contraindicated, except for sleep, since they mask pain and may allow overvigorous activity. Early strengthening exercises include the Williams flexion exercises and/or McKenzie extension exercises. Both exercise motions may often be prescribed. Athletes with an acute disc herniation, however, should only perform extension exercises initially. Athletes with spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis and facet joint irritation should initially be limited to flexion exercises.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

This unusual case demonstrates the importance of careful history taking and neurological examination where symptoms of postspinal headache persist.
CD008686,0,1752549,0,[Tuberculosis of the spine and ribs].,"Tuberculosis of the spine or ribs is uncommon, occurring in less than 1% of patients with tuberculosis (TB). 2 women are presented who recently immigrated from Ethiopia and India, respectively. One, aged 55, presented with chest pain, fatigue and several masses under the skin of the scalp. Chest X-ray and CT scan suggested Pancoast tumor, and the lateral parts of the first 2 right ribs were absent. The origin of the patient, clinical findings and positive PPD suggested TB of the ribs and anti-TB therapy resulted in cure. The diagnosis was later confirmed by a positive culture. The other woman, aged 68, presented with fatigue, mild abdominal pain and axillary lymphadenopathy. The PPD was positive and X-ray showed widening of the mediastinum. A caseating granuloma with Langhans epithelioid cells was found in a lymph node. Flaccid paraparesis developed before therapy was started. CT scan showed a typical picture of TB affecting the T3-T6 vertebrae. Drainage of a cold abscess of the spine via the anterior approach was followed by anti-TB therapy. Culture of a biopsied lymph node and of pus obtained at operation confirmed the diagnosis of TB. The patient died 2 months later from gastrointestinal bleeding. Awareness of the unusual presentations of various forms of TB is mandatory in countries with immigration from countries in which TB is still common."
CD008686,0,1813187,0,[A case of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) associated with transverse myelitis responding to pulse therapy].,"A 42-year-old female was admitted to our hospital on October 1, 1990 because of one week history of back pain, weakness of her right lower extremity and sensory disturbance of her left lower extremity. Physical examination revealed swollen hands, Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly and heliotrope rash. The body temperature was 37.0 degrees C. Neurological findings included weakness in the right lower extremity, left hypalgesia and thermohypesthesia below Th4, hyperreflexia on the right lower extremity and right extensive plantar response. Laboratory data showed leucopenia (3,700/mm3) and hypergammaglobulinemia. Serological examination revealed antinuclear antibodies with a titer of 1:5120 (speckled pattern) and anti-RNP antibody with a titer of 1:32. Neither anti-DNA antibody nor anti-Sm antibody were detected. Serum C3 and C4 were normal. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained mononuclear cells of 5/mm3, protein 29 mg/dl and glucose 56 mg/dl. Queckenstedt test was negative. Treatment with prednisolone 60 mg daily was started. On the 8th day of therapy, she complained of a burning sensation in the back, then paraplegia and urinary retention developed. MRI examination showed a high intensity area of the spinal cord at the right Th4 on T2-weighted images. Next day the treatment with 1000-mg intravenous daily pulse of methylprednisolone for 3 days was started, followed by prednisolone 40 mg daily. After this pulse therapy, the CSF contained mononuclear cells of 52/mm3, protein 34 mg/dl, glucose 67 mg/dl and IgG 7.6 mg/dl. Her neurological manifestation gradually improved and at six weeks after the pulse therapy neurological examination revealed no abnormality except for painful tonic spasm.

CD008686,0,1799516,0,[An autopsy case of multiple sclerosis with bilateral continuous cystic lesions along lateral ventricles and caudate-callosal angles (Wetterwinkel)].,"A 47-year old female had a fever about 39 degrees C of unknown origin for 2 days. Soon she developed pain in the bilateral lower extremities followed by gait disturbance and vesicorectal disorder. Prednisolone was administered with an improvement. However, she developed paresthesia in the upper extremities 1 month later, and then gradually paraplegia another 5 month later. Nystagmus, painful tonic spasm, facial spasm, and visual disorder also appeared. These symptoms repeatedly exacerbated and remitted with administration of prednisolone. We examined this patient at age 53, CBC, blood chemistry, urinalysis, ECG and chest X-ray were normal. Serum IgG and IgA level were decreased. CSF protein content and IgG level were remarkably increased. EEG showed diffuse theta activities. MRI studies revealed high intensity signals in the putamen, deep frontal and periventricular white matter region. Pulse therapy of methylprednisolone was performed effectively for several times. She died of respiratory and heart failure 6 years after the onset. Autopsy revealed bilateral continuous cystic lesions along the lateral ventricles extending from the frontal tips of anterior horns to the occipital tips of posterior, and further, to the temporal tips of lateral horns; the caudate-callosal angeles (Wetterwinkel) were more severely and widely affected bilaterally. There were also old and fresh demyelinated lesions scattered in the cerebral white matter, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Although this case is considered to have typical MS from clinical and pathological findings, there have been only a few reports of MS with such continuous cystic lesions in the cerebral hemispheres as seen in this case."
CD008686,0,1758428,0,Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression.,"It is important to remember that ESCC is a complication of systemic malignancy and usually denotes disseminated disease with poor survival rates. Early diagnosis is crucial. The initial symptom is almost always back pain, which is local, radicular, or both. Following neurologic examination and radiography, MRI scanning or myelography/CT is immediately indicated if radiculopathy or myelopathy is present or if the radiographs of the spine are abnormal. In cancer patients with local back pain and normal findings on neurologic examination and radiography of the spine, there is still a probability of 0.1 of significant ESCC. Therefore, urgent CT/MRI scanning is justified. At present, the best treatment for ESCC remains unknown. In the majority of patients, radiotherapy is the most readily available and appropriate option because it is equal in effect to posterior decompressive laminectomy in both radiosensitive and radioresistant tumors. In patients with posterior epidural disease without tissue diagnosis, laminectomy with or without stabilization should be performed. Posterior decompressive laminectomy alone is contraindicated in patients with vertebral collapse. In selected instances of anterior epidural compression without tissue diagnosis or after failure of radiotherapy, an anterior surgical approach or synchronous vertebral decompression with posterior stabilization may be indicated. In the future, after appropriate clinical trials, vertebral body resection may be the optimal approach in de novo selected patients with ESCC with radioresistant tumors and limited systemic spread of the disease."
CD008686,0,1758425,0,Neurologic complications of systemic lymphoma.,"Lymphoma denotes a heterogeneous group of neoplasms derived from lymphoreticular tissues. It can cause neurologic symptoms by infiltrating into the meninges or brain parenchyma. Alternatively, lymphomas may metastasize to bone or infiltrate into the epidural space via intervertebral foramina to cause neurologic dysfunction by compressing adjacent CNS structures. These direct effects can occur at any time during the disease process; most distressingly, meningeal infiltration may be the initial site of relapse after a complete remission. Diffuse and more undifferentiated lymphomas are much more likely to be responsible for producing either meningeal infiltration or intraparenchymal lesions. Direct CNS invasion by lymphoma is associated with significant patient morbidity and short survival despite intensive therapy; whether this manifestation of lymphoma can be prevented by prophylactic CNS treatment remains uncertain. CNS complications may also occur as a result of indirect effects of lymphoma. Therefore, CNS dysfunction may develop as a result of infections that occur secondary to immunosuppression, as a result of antineoplastic therapies, or as a result of true paraneoplastic syndromes. It is important to distinguish between these indirect effects and tumor progression because their recognition permits frequently available appropriate treatment modalities to be administered."
CD008686,0,1747233,0,Intrathecal narcotics for relief of pain from head and neck cancer.,"We describe our experience with nine patients with head and neck pain of malignant origin who were treated with continuous low-dose intrathecal morphine via a lumbar catheter and implantable subcutaneous drug delivery pump. All patients had failed prior attempts at oral narcotic pain control due to either poor pain control or intolerable side effects. Using a visual analogue scale where the most severe pain is rated as 10 and no pain is rated as 0, the mean visual analogue scale was reduced from 7.6/10 (range, 5 to 10/10) before implantation to 1.9/10, 2.0/10, and 0.5/10 at 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months after implantation, respectively. Complications were acceptable. We conclude that intrathecal administration of morphine is a safe and effective means of pain control. This method deserves serious consideration in patients with intractable pain secondary to head and neck malignancy."
CD008686,0,1722001,0,Nerve plexus metastases.,"Metastatic plexopathy is often a disabling accompaniment of advanced systemic cancer and may involve any of the peripheral nerve plexus. Brachial plexopathy most commonly occurs in carcinoma of the breast and lung; lumbosacral plexopathy is most common with colorectal and gynecologic tumors, sarcomas, and lymphomas. Regardless of the location, carcinomatous plexopathy typically is associated with severe unrelenting pain as the cardinal clinical feature. Later, weakness and focal sensory disturbances occur in the distribution of plexuses involvement. Epidural tumor involvement frequently (in more than 50% of patients) coexists with either plexopathy. In previously treated patients, the main differential diagnostic consideration is radiation-induced plexopathy. Treatment of metastatic plexopathy is palliative and includes radiotherapy to the tumor mass and chemotherapy. In selected patients, subtotal surgical resection of the tumor may be warranted. The response to therapy is modest and generally short lived. Efforts should be made to provide adequate pain control, to maximize remaining neurologic function, and to prevent complications of immobility produced by the neuromuscular dysfunction."

CD008686,0,1770697,0,[Intra-arterial cisplatin and concurrent radiation for invasive bladder cancer].,"Fifteen patients with invasive bladder cancer were treated with selective intra-arterial cisplatin and external beam radiotherapy (30.6 Gy over 3 weeks) prior to a planned cystectomy. Cisplatin, in total 200 mg, was administered via bilateral internal iliac artery infusion during the course of radiotherapy. Seven patients were evaluated for local response. Partial response (PR) was revealed in 4, and minor response (MR) in 3. Ten patients received total cystectomy, and pathological effects by the criteria adipted by Japanese Urological Association and The Japanese Society of Pathology, were as follows: Ef. 3 in 1 case, Ef. 2 in 6. Ef. 1b in 1 and Ef. 1a in 2. Down staging was observed in 8 patients from the clinical to the pathological stage. Thirteen patients are alive for 21 months. Two patients have died (1 lung infarction, 1 pancreatic cancer). Though nausea and sciatica-like pain were observed in some cases, there was no severe systemic side effects such as bone marrow suppression and renal toxicity. From these results it is concluded that this therapeutic modality could be effective in the preoperative work-up of candidates for total cystectomy, and also that it could be useful in the treatment of patients in whom total cystectomy is contraindicated."

CD008686,0,1718047,0,Control of cancer pain by epidural infusion of morphine.,"Pain that cannot be controlled by traditional oral and parenteral methods in those patients with advanced cancer can be alleviated by spinal administration of narcotics. Epidural and intrathecal infusion with morphine causes analgesia by blocking spinal receptors without significant long-term central nervous, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary system effects. Of the total of 33 patients, epidural catheters inserted in 20 patients then connected by a subcutaneous tunnel to a continuous infusion system. Implanted pumps were used in each of these patients. Because of the cost and limitations of the implanted pumps, epidural catheters were connected, either directly or by subcutaneous reservoirs, to external ambulatory infusion pumps in the remaining 13 patients. Patient assessment by a linear analogue scale to measure pain levels determined that 23 of the 33 total patients (70%) had excellent or good relief of pain. The delivery of spinal administration of narcotics to treat intractable cancer pain in patients is safe. Most importantly, this method of delivery can be used in community hospitals, in outpatient settings, and in home health care programs."
CD008686,0,1955901,0,Damaged ligaments at the craniocervical junction presenting as an extradural tumour: a differential diagnosis in the elderly.,"An extradural mass at the craniocervical junction causing progressive neurological disability in five elderly patients is described. The lesion, which might be confused with a meningioma or other tumour, is composed of amorphous degenerate fibrocartilaginous material and could be due to degeneration of the ligaments responsible for atlanto-axial stability. Recognition of the condition early is important as the patient's clinical condition will deteriorate without decompression. Anterior transoral removal is relatively simple, unlike surgery for tumours in the area, and will not destabilise the craniovertebral junction. It is likely that a proportion of these lesions are undetected, misdiagnosed or untreated to the detriment of the patient."
CD008686,0,1953064,0,[Giant pseudocysts of the adrenal gland. Clinico-pathologic study of 2 cases].,"Adrenal pseudocysts are cystic lesions in the gland whose wall has no internal lining to permit a more precise classification. These can develop into very large cysts containing several liters of liquid. They account for almost half of all adrenal cystic lesions in young or middle-aged adults. In 50% of the cases these are incidentally discovered during laparotomy or radiographic evaluation. Its origin is still a controversy. The present study describes the clinical and anatomopathological features of two giant pseudocysts of the adrenal gland. One of the patients was asymptomatic (an IVP incidentally disclosed the presence of a mass). The other case consulted for lumbar pain. Furthermore, the different types of adrenal cysts reported in the literature and the differential diagnosis from other adrenal cystic lesions, mainly tumors and infections, are discussed."
CD008686,0,1942535,0,[IgG lambda-type multiple myeloma associated with myelofibrosis accompanied by thrombocytosis].,"A 72-year-old male had complained of right back pain and bleeding from his tongue. He was admitted to our department on May 18, 1989. Physical examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood findings were as follows: RBC was 3.80 x 10(6)/microliters. Hb 12.2 g/dl, Ht 36.5%, platelet count 735 x 10(3)/microliters, WBC 22,100/microliters, leukoerythroblastosis present. Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score was normal. Serum vitamin B12 and plasma platelet-derived growth factor level were elevated. Skeletal X-ray revealed multiple punched-out lesions at the 8th thoracic vertebra, and 6th and 8th ribs. Serum IgG level was 3,900 mg/dl. Serum immunoelectrophoresis revealed IgG lambda-type M-protein. Because he complained of severe cervical pain, and skeletal X-ray examination revealed the fracture of 6th cervical vertebra, the operation was performed to remove the lesion. Biopsy of cervical lesion revealed plasmacytoma. M-protein was decreased and the size of the tumor was reduced after treatment with VCAP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, prednisolone) regimen and interferon-alpha for multiple myeloma."
CD008686,0,1809517,0,[Tumor compression of the conus and cauda].,"The author analyzed a group of 17 patients with spinal tumours with symptoms of compression of the conus or cauda. Early clinical symptoms were sought and the entire clinical course before surgery was evaluated. The objective clinical finding was compared with the surgical one. Causes of diagnostic errors were analyzed. Most frequently a discogenic or other vertebrogenic cause of complaints was suspected. In all patients a local or root symptoms were the first manifestation of the disease. From the investigation ensues that a tumour must be considered when pain radiates into both lower extremities, in case of striking stiffness of the spine up to the neck and in case of damage of the higher lumbar roots. Tumours are more frequently located higher than prolapsed discs with manifestations of caudal compression. When bone structures are affected in primary tumours, the objective clinical finding may be very sparse. Tumours at the borderline of Th-L may be manifested by root symptoms L5 or S1. During PMG attention is focused lower, usually a prolapsed disc of L4/5 or L5/S1 is suspected and the tumour may be missed. Values of cerebrospinal fluid proteins in fluid collected at the lumbar level were high in all patients of the group."

Abdominal ultrasonography, enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), selective renal angiography and vena cavography revealed a left renal tumor extending into the inferior vena cava and right atrium. Surgery was performed using the cardiopulmonary bypass and the whole tumor was resected grossly except for the tumor invading into the lumbar vein. The patient recovered promptly but died from cancer metastasis six months after operation."
CD008686,0,1894168,0,Manometric characterization of rectal dysfunction following radical hysterectomy.,"Bladder dysfunction thought to be due to partial denervation has been described following radical hysterectomy. Some patients experience acute and chronic rectal dysfunction characterized by difficulty with defecation and loss of defecatory urge. To define this abnormality, anorectal pressure profiles were examined in 15 patients with Stage I carcinoma of the cervix before and after radical hysterectomy. Profiles were done using standard anorectal manometry with a water-infused system. In all patients preoperative manometric profiles were normal; postoperative studies were abnormal in all patients. Features seen include altered relaxation of the internal sphincter, increased distension needed to trigger relaxation, and decreased rectal sensation; external sphincters and resting internal sphincters were unchanged. Postoperatively, 12 patients reported problems with rectal function. A physiologic defect is definable in patients undergoing radical hysterectomy; this suggests disruption of the spinal reflex arcs controlling rectal emptying. These physiologic abnormalities correlate with the clinical symptomatology experienced by some patients. Continuing definition and evaluation of management options in this situation should be useful in developing effective therapy for rectal dysfunction following radical hysterectomy."
CD008686,0,1715370,0,The role of radiotherapy in palliative care.,"Radiotherapy is an indispensable modality in the palliation of cancer. All palliative care programs should be acquainted with its indications and have a close working relationship with a radiation oncology department. The technical aspects of the subject may be intimidating to many staff and patients, and departments need to improve their outreach and education. The main indications are: pain relief (particularly bone pain), control of hemorrhage, fungation and ulceration, dyspnea, blockage of hollow viscera, and the shrinkage of any tumors causing problems by virtue of space occupancy. In addition, it has an important role in the palliation of three oncological emergencies: superior vena caval obstruction, spinal cord compression, and raised intracranial pressure due to cerebral metastases. More pragmatic fractionation schedules are being developed that are compatible with good results in terms of palliative end points, giving shorter courses with fewer hospital attendances for patient and family comfort and convenience. More clinical research and evaluation of palliative radiotherapy are required."
CD008686,0,1712835,0,Effect of daily etidronate on the osteolysis of multiple myeloma.,"Progressive bone disease in multiple myeloma frequently leads to osteolysis, bone resorption, pathologic fractures, vertebral compression, and hypercalcemia. We conducted a double-blind study in 173 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients of etidronate disodium (EHDP), a diphosphonate compound that reduces bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclastic activity. The patients were randomly assigned to receive oral EHDP 5 mg/kg/d or placebo until death or discontinuation due to intolerance or refusal. The extent of vertebral deformity was measured by a vertebral index as well as height. The frequency of pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and bone pain was regularly assessed, as well as size and number of osteolytic lesions. All patients received melphalan and prednisone daily for 4 days every 4 weeks as the primary chemotherapy for their disease. Although the repeated measures analysis showed a significant height loss, there was no difference between treatment arms (P = .98). There was no significant difference in bone pain, episodes of hypercalcemia, or development of pathologic fractures. Patients on EHDP showed less deterioration in their vertebral index, but this difference only approached statistical significance (P = .07). We conclude that EHDP therapy used in this dosage schedule does not have a clinically significant impact in multiple myeloma."
CD008686,0,1653406,0,Chronic perineal pain related to sacral meningeal cysts.,"Chronic perineal pain is an often encountered problem that is difficult to evaluate. Based on a series of 17 patients in whom urological, gynecological, and anorectal pathology was excluded, the authors compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with computed tomographic (CT) scan with myelography in the investigation of chronic perineal pain. After a clinical neurological examination, patients underwent radiodiagnostic imaging of both techniques. Thirteen patients (76%) had one or more sacral meningeal cysts (MC) on MRI scan, whereas CT scan with myelography of the lumbar and sacral region revealed 7 patients (41%) with sacral MC. Sacral MC may be the etiology of chronic perineal pain in many instances, and MRI scan appears to be superior to CT scan with myelography in demonstrating sacral MC. Ten patients with sacral MC were operated on with moderate to excellent results 6 months after operation. Early postoperative results are encouraging, but further follow-up and larger series are required."
CD008686,0,11642921,0,An appraisal of the ethical issues involved in high-technology cancer pain relief.,"... We will turn our attention to the current state of pain relief technology and the ethical questions surrounding the use of advanced technology, otherwise referred to as ""high-tech,"" pain relief. It is obvious that pain may decrease the quality of life for cancer patients. The availability of long-acting narcotics, such as MS Contin or methadone, affords cancer patients long-duration pain relief at minimal cost. The use of adjuvant medications may also be important. Clinical examples of the effective use of adjuvant medications include the addition of a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory agent to help patients cope with bone pain and the use of a serotonin blocking agent to reduce the transmission of pain impulses in the spinal cord. Only a small percentage of patients are good candidates for high-tech delivery systems for narcotic administration. In our pain management clinic, all patients are initially placed on oral medications. When the side effects of oral medications become excessive, or the patient becomes unable to take oral medications, high-tech modalities are considered for use."

CD008686,0,1861056,0,Nontraumatic abdominal aortic thrombosis presenting with anterior spinal artery syndrome and pulmonary edema.,"A 51-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer developed pulmonary edema and lower extremity paraplegia with preservation of proprioception as the initial manifestation of abdominal aortic thrombosis. Back pain was present in the lumbar region radiating to buttocks and legs in a bilateral radicular pattern. Femoral pulses were initially palpable. Aortic angiography revealed complete abdominal aortic occlusion at L3 as well as total occlusion of the bilateral superficial femoral arteries and bilateral common iliac arteries. Transient occlusion of the anterior spinal artery due to aortic thrombosis may cause paraplegia and may also progress to renal failure, bowel infarction, and limb loss if left untreated. Abdominal aortic thrombosis needs to be considered in a patient who presents with an anterior spinal artery syndrome, which, if present, must be treated as rapidly as possible to preserve motor and sensory function."
CD008686,0,1831248,0,Sufentanil citrate and morphine/bupivacaine as alternative agents in chronic epidural infusions for intractable non-cancer pain.,"Intraspinal narcotic (usually intrathecal morphine) infusions with implanted pumps are increasingly used in patients with intractable chronic pain not caused by cancer. In some patients, pain control is difficult with infusions of morphine. Seven patients with diagnoses of arachnoiditis, epidural scarring, and/or vertebral body compression fracture were treated with alternative solutions in an epidural route. For maximal flexibility, Medtronic implanted programmable infusion pumps with catheters to T6-T10 were used, and pain was monitored by verbal pain scales. In three patients, epidural infusions of morphine in 0.5% bupivacaine (MS-MARC) resulted in little or no pain relief without significant side effects (e.g., headache, nausea, or vomiting). In these same patients, epidural infusions of sufentanil citrate resulted in pain scale reductions of 92%, 82%, and 40%, respectively, with no side effects. Four other patients found more effective pain relief when switched from initial sufentanil citrate infusions to MS-MARC. Pain scale reductions (with no side effects) were 92%, 76%, 59%, and 47% in these patients. Pain relief and minimal side effects with sufentanil citrate is theorized to result from its higher lipophilicity promoting local transdural diffusion to spinal cord and limiting upward diffusion to the brain stem. Sufentanil citrate is also advantageous for programmable pumps because it is 100 times more potent than morphine and therefore allows longer pump refill times and higher infusion doses. Although this study was done on a limited number of patients, sufentanil citrate and MS-MARC in epidural infusions using programmable infusion pumps for non-cancer patients provide significant alternative drug combinations and routes."
CD008686,0,1774133,0,Evaluation of NK and LAK cell activities in neoplastic patients during treatment with morphine.,"The cytotoxic activity of Natural Killer (NK) and Lymphokine Activated Killer (LAK) cells in neoplastic patients with or without antalgic treatment was studied. NK cell activity was found reduced in untreated neoplastic patients when compared to healthy subjects. The atalgic treatment with morphine (orally or intrathecally administered) was able to significantly reduce the mean values of NK cell activity found in cancer patients. In three patients the cytotoxicity of NK cells significantly decreased during transfer from oral to intrathecal administration of morphine. In contrast to the NK cell function, the development of LAK cell activity significantly increased in neoplastic patients when compared to healthy controls. Further increments were obtained during treatment with morphine. The oral treatment with morphine was able to determine a higher induction of LAK cells than the intrathecal administration of the drug. Besides providing new knowledge on the effect of morphine on immune system our findings suggest that, in order to include neoplastic patients in clinical trials of adoptive immunotherapy with LAK cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2), the antalgic therapy with oral administration of morphine may represent a better solution than the intrathecal administration of the drug."
CD008686,0,1716752,0,Pain characterization in cancer patients and the analgetic response to epidural morphine.,"In 48 patients with pain related to malignancy, a pain characterization was performed during oral opioid therapy. After an optimal epidural morphine regimen had been established, the alteration in pain relief was evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale. The CSF and plasma morphine concentrations at minimum steady state were then analysed in 28 patients and related to the degree of pain relief. The efficacy of the spinal treatment ranked in the following order: somatic greater than visceral greater than radiating = 0, but the difference was only significant between the somatic and radiating pain groups. There was a tendency for continuous pain to be better relieved than intermittent pain. No correlations were found between the CSF or plasma morphine concentrations and the degree of pain relief, suggesting that not all pain impulses are modulated in a dose-dependent manner by morphine at the spinal level. Pain characterization may be instrumental in providing an optimal spinal opioid analgesia in malignancy. Moreover, there is a need for better defined diagnostic criteria for clinical pain characterization."

The SEP and an MRI led to a diagnosis of a tumor at the left cervico-medullary junction, much higher than the clinically suspected level. Surgical exploration revealed an exophytic glioma, and the pain was abolished postoperatively. Ephaptic transmission at the tumor site was suspected as a pathophysiologic mechanism."
CD008686,0,2039390,0,Central nervous system germinomas. A review.,"The germinoma represents a less malignant form of germ cell tumor. Depending on the individual's age, this neoplasm constitutes approximately 0.1% to 3.4% of all intracranial tumors. The embryologic origin remains a mystery; however, current theories implicate an aberration in primordial germ cell migration. Clinical presentation depends on tumor location and may involve endocrine, hypothalamic, visual, and cognitive dysfunction. In evaluating midline intracerebral masses, it is imperative that one be aware of the various radiologic appearances, endocrinologic changes, and chemical markers that help to distinguish germinomas from other neoplasms that appear in the pineal, suprasellar, and periventricular regions. Only through the careful evaluation of all available studies can the physician institute appropriate therapies such as biopsy, radiation, and chemotherapy. This article focuses on the epidemiology, embryology, clinical presentation, means of diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of this rare neoplasm."

Only histologically diagnosed tumours of spinal cord, root-nerve and their envelops in patients resident in the island for at least one year were included in the investigation. The annual crude incidence rate was 0.5 per 100,000 population (0.63 in the females and 0.37 in the males). M/F ratio was 1.7. Mean age was 45 years (35.5 in males; 50.7 in females). Age and sex distribution showed higher frequence of intrarachidian tumours in females over 40 years of age and in males younger than 40 years. Meningiomas were more frequent in females aged between 47 and 74 years. The dorsal localization of the tumours was more frequent. Subjective sensory complaints (85.3%) and motor impairment (76%) were the main symptoms at onset; at the time of diagnosis motor impairment (92%) and objective sensory disturbances (82.7%) prevailed. A twelve months interval elapsed between onset of first symptoms and diagnosis in 64% of patients; within 24 months 81.3% of tumours were diagnosed. Surgery induced improvement in 74.6% of patients, no improvement in 17.3%; a worsening was noticed in 8%. Seven patients died after surgery (3 owing to the tumour). These data are partly consonant and partly in contrast with those present in literature."
CD008686,0,1839613,0,Spinal arteriovenous malformation.,"The authors discuss a patient with a large (15 x 10 x 12 cm), bony soft tissue intradural arteriovenous malformation (AVM) who presented with a 20-year history of back pain. Plain radiographs revealed a destructive lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging showed serpentine vascular structures within the thecal sac and lytic bone lesions with multiple level involvement. A Craig needle biopsy by the referring physician, as well as an open biopsy by the authors, caused severe bleeding. There was no evidence of neoplasm. Selective spinal angiography demonstrated a metameric juvenile type AVM whose intradural component was fed by the artery of Adamkiewicz. Because the patient had no neurological deficit on presentation, the options of embolization and then surgery were considered too risky. The patient is being followed conservatively."
CD008686,0,1806076,0,Magnetic stimulation: examination of motor function in patients with cervical spine or cord lesion.,"In 20 patients with cervical spine or cord lesions, we examined motor evoked potentials (MEPs) by transcranially applied magnetic stimulation to the motor cortex. We used a large-diameter (12 cm) coil to induce equal current in both left and right hemispheres. The MEPs were recorded simultaneously from multiple muscles covering the C5 to C8 myotome distribution bilaterally. The MEP abnormalities correlated well with clinical muscle weakness in 15 patients. In two patients, MEP revealed abnormalities in muscles of normal strength. Three patients with sensory but without motor deficit had normal MEPs. We conclude that magnetic stimulation is a useful adjunct in confirming and objectifying motor weakness, and in localizing the level of dysfunction in cervical spine lesions."

A 26 year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a 10-day history of headache, nausea and vertigo. On admission, disturbance of consciousness (10-20 by JCS), irregular respiration and central fixation of both eyes suggesting increased intracranial pressure and early stage of central herniation were recognized clinically. The cerebellar signs of dysmetria and nystagmus were also observed. CT scan and angiography revealed an avascular large mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere, obstructive hydrocephalus and upward transtentorial herniation. On MRI study, the mass was demonstrated to be a subacute hematoma with a small tumor in its margin. Total removal of the tumor and aspiration of the hematoma were performed. Histological examination revealed a highly cellular and pleomorphic astrocytic tumor with scattered small necrosis and glomeruloid capillary endothelial proliferation, typical of glioblastoma multiforme. During postoperative radiochemotherapy (focal irradiation to the posterior fossa), the tumor showed rapid regrowth and a second look operation was performed. He was readmitted 3 weeks after radiochemotherapy with complaints of severe headache, nausea and lumbago. He then suddenly became dyspnea, tetraplegic and bradycardic. Neuroradiological investigation revealed multiple masses in the suprasellar region, medulla oblongata and the cervical spinal cord, but no recurrence in the cerebellum. Malignant cells were noted on CSF cytology. During chemotherapy for CSF tumor dissemination, his condition deteriorated rapidly and he died 7 months after the onset of symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008686,0,2047640,0,[Paresthesias].,"A 23-year-old patient suddenly experienced paresthesia in both legs which progressively ascended to the region of the umbilicus and finally also occurred in all fingers. The physical examination revealed a decreased sensation for touch, discrimination and vibration in all paresthetical regions and on the stem even up to dermatome C5. A mild elevation of the protein content, a mononuclear pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands were found in the cerebrospinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spinal cord showed a hyperintensive lesion in the region of the posterior tract at C6. With respect to these findings and after exclusion of other neurological affections, multiple sclerosis was diagnosed. The symptoms subsided spontaneously within five weeks, and the patient was discharged without any complaints. The diagnostic accuracy of the various findings is discussed."
CD008686,0,2026822,0,Sciatic endometriosis: MR appearance.,"Endometriosis of the sciatic nerve is a rare but important cause of sciatica. Early on, the symptoms may be cyclic and be treated with local excision of the endometrioma from the sciatic nerve. If left untreated, it can result in marked cicatricial change of the sciatic nerve and require more radical surgical treatment. Due to the hemorrhagic nature of endometriomas and their characteristic location, the MR imaging findings can permit a specific diagnosis of sciatic endometriosis to be suggested. Therefore, MR imaging is recommended for evaluation of sciatica if the symptoms vary with the menstrual cycle or if there is a history of endometriosis. Early recognition of this disorder will facilitate appropriate treatment and minimize permanent damage to the sciatic nerve. The first surgically proven case of sciatic endometriosis with preoperative MR imaging is presented."
CD008686,0,1934764,0,[Nationwide survey of necrotizing myelopathy associated with malignancy in Japan].,"Twenty-two cases of transverse myelopathy associated with malignancy were collected in nationwide survey in Japan. Paraneoplastic necrotizing myelopathy (PNM) was suspected in 9 of them and 8 cases were diagnosed as radiation myelopathy (RM), clinically and pathologically. Other 5 cases had different causes of transverse myelopathy. In comparison with PNM and RM, malignant lymphoma, flaccid paraplegia and sphincter dysfunction were highly associated in the patients with PNM. On the other hand, lung cancer, spastic paraplegia, abnormality in spinal MRI and dysesthesia in legs as an initial symptom were prevalent in the cases of RM. Six cases of them were compared pathologically. Although all cases had no metastasis of malignant cells, five cases of PMN showed acute and chronic necrosis and rarefaction of spinal cord with or without perivascular cuffing. One case of RM had focal spinal cord atrophy and no lymphocytes infiltration. Immunohistochemically, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) infection in spinal cord was shown in the 2 cases of the necrotizing myelopathy. Virus infection such as HSV2 could be one of causes of PNM and virological study must be done in the cases of necrotizing myelopathy associated with malignancy."
CD008686,0,1850337,0,Cauda equina compression associated with breast cancer. A case study in differential diagnosis.,"The determination of the etiology of spinal cord compression in cancer patients is essential for appropriate therapy. Patients with metastatic disease are not immune to the development of superimposed nonmalignant disease. Although metastatic epidural compression may occur in up to 9% of breast cancer patients, care must be taken to rule out other nonmetastatic lesions causing compression. The association of concurrent breast carcinoma and a spinal neurilemoma simulating a metastatic lesion seems not to have been previously reported. A neurilemoma was observed in a 50-year-old woman. A neurilemoma suspected to be a metastatic lesion may produce the clinical features of pain, neurologic deficit, and weakness. Differentiation will be aided by roentgenograms, radionuclide bone scans, computed tomography, and possible magnetic resonance imaging. Radiologic differentiation hinges on the recognition and the slow-growing nature and noninvasive boundaries of the nonmalignant lesion. Ultimate verification is by biopsy. Treatment should consist of neurectomy, if severely symptomatic, and stabilization as indicated."
CD008686,0,1664447,0,Encephaloradiculopathy: a non-metastatic complication of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"We describe a patient with a silent hepatocellular carcinoma in whom a progressive dysfunction developed in the brainstem, cerebrum, and cerebellum. This clinical manifestation was also associated with polyradiculopathy. The changes were microscopically unlike those seen in hepatic encephalopathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and other metabolic encephalopathy. The findings seem to have occurred as a paraneoplastic syndrome of the nervous system. Although in the present case, the cause-and-effect relationship between the hepatocellular carcinoma and the encephaloradiculopathy is only hypothetical, we suggest that the demyelinating process which involves both central and peripheral nervous system in our case resulted from interaction of tumor with the host-immunological mechanism. The neurological presentation in our case is unique and has never been reported before."
CD008686,0,1660440,0,Cholesterol embolism of bone marrow clinically masquerading as systemic or metastatic tumor.,"A case of cholesterol embolism of bone marrow, concerning the pelvis and lumbar region and clinically masquerading as systemic disease or metastatic tumor, is reported in an 82-year-old man hospitalized for acute onset of reddish purple nodules on the legs and toes, intense myalgia and dorsal vertebral bone pain. The clinical manifestations leading to consideration of a systemic disease or metastatic tumor were the abnormal bone scintigraphic findings of the pelvis and lumbar region, the elevation of serum alkaline and acid phosphatase and the increase of the bone isoenzyme fractions. The diagnosis of cholesterol embolism was explained by the histological findings of bone marrow biopsy which showed microinfarctions of bone marrow with an osteoproductive and reparative process, and presence of cholesterol clefts."
CD008686,0,2056981,0,[Perineal pain and rectal cancer--prevalence in local recurrence].,"Between 1983 and 1989, 85 patients with either carcinoma of the rectum or a recurrence of a previously diagnosed rectal tumour (47 women and 38 men aged 20 to 87 years) were treated in our pain clinic. In 50 patients, the reason for referral was perineal pain which had been present for one week to two years (median six months, 25%-percentile six weeks, 75%-percentile six months). In some patients this was considered to be due to scar tissue formation by the referring doctors. The pain was classified somatic, visceral and neuropathic in approximately equal numbers of patients, and about half of them described more than one type of pain. The other 35 patients were suffering from pain at other sites. In 40 out of 50 patients with perineal pain, local tumour recurrence was diagnosed. In 29 patients, pain symptoms began with a median of 5.5 months before the tumour recurrence was diagnosed. In a further seven patients, other types of tumour dissemination in the pelvis were considered to be the cause of the perineal pain. In only three patients no evidence of tumour was found in the pelvis. A non-neoplastic cause of perineal pain could be definitely confirmed in only one patient on post-mortem examination. 35 patients reported no perineal pain on admission, although in 19 cases a local cancer recurrence was found. 13 of these patients suffered from pain in the area of sensory innervation of the lumbosacral plexus. From 16 patients without a diagnosis of local recurrence, only four reported pain in this area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,2067085,0,[Non-secretory primary plasma cell leukemia with hyperammonemia].,"A 78-year-old man was admitted because of lumbago and chest pain. A diagnosis of non-secretory primary plasma cell leukemia was made based on the laboratory findings and his history. However, the plaque-forming cells assay of bone marrow cells revealed secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulin from the myeloma cells. Hyperammonemia was detected in the serum. Although the patient was treated with 4 courses of combination chemotherapy (vincristine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, methylprednisolone), he died of respiratory failure five months after diagnosis. Autopsy showed widespread multiple myeloma and prominent infiltration of myeloma cell in the sinusoid of the liver. Recently, there have been a few reports which increased the plasma ammonia concentration with multiple myeloma. This report strongly suggested that liver infiltration of myeloma cell caused hyperammonemia."
CD008686,0,2015734,0,Morphine pharmacokinetics and pain assessment after intracerebroventricular administration in patients with terminal cancer.,"Morphine pharmacokinetics and pain relief were evaluated after intracerebroventricular administration of morphine (0.4 +/- 0.11 mg) in seven patients with cancer suffering from intractable pain. Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lumbar CSF, and plasma morphine concentrations were analyzed by a specific morphine radioimmunoassay. A two-compartment model was sufficient to describe the kinetics of morphine in ventricular CSF. Morphine diffuses to the lumbar level, and the mean maximum concentration was 192 +/- 105 ng/ml at 4.5 +/- 1.3 hours. Ventricular and lumbar CSF morphine kinetics showed a similar decline during the elimination phase, with terminal half-lives of 3.8 +/- 0.6 hours and 4.2 +/- 1.6 hours, respectively. Pain relief was evaluated by a visual analog scale: the test showed a rapid onset of analgesia (less than 10 minutes). Analgesic effectiveness reached a maximum between 6 and 10 hours. The relationship between pharmacologic effect and morphine concentrations in ventricular CSF resulted in an anticlockwise hysteresis curve. The presence of morphine in lumbar CSF suggested an additive spinal action of morphine, which probably plays a role in the duration of analgesia."
CD008686,0,2033783,0,Epidural spinal cord compression from metastatic cancer: clinical features and management.,"We retrospectively analyzed thirty-three patients (21 males, 12 females) with malignancy induced spinal cord compression (SCC). The mean age of the patients was 42.8 years and almost half (51%) of them presented with SCC. Mean duration of symptoms was 4.5 months and the mean interval between the original diagnosis of cancer and the development of SCC was 14.6 months. Back pain was the most frequent (97%) symptom with an equal number of patients having subjective or objective evidence of lower limb weakness. Majority (73%) of the patients were non-ambulatory at the time of diagnosis. Spinal level involvement was mostly thoracic (62%) followed by lumber (38%). Breast cancer was the commonest underlying malignancy (21%). Lung (12%), prostrate (12%), multiple myeloma (9%), and carcinoma with unknown primary (12%) were also frequently encountered. There was an overall response rate of 22% to the therapeutic interventions: mostly observed in the ambulatory patients. Only 7% of the non-ambulatory patients regained ability to walk. None of the responders had bladder or bowel dysfunction. Twenty-two percent of the responders are still ambulatory with a mean follow-up of six months."
CD008686,0,2006130,0,The limping child.,Evaluation of a limping child requires careful consideration and a basic knowledge of potential problems affecting the child. The most important point is not to miss or delay diagnosis of the septic hip. This is truly an orthopedic emergency. Complaints of knee pain should not throw the physician off the track of a diagnosis of hip disease. It is also important to be aware of how the medical history affects the musculoskeletal system. Many causes of limp are best analyzed by repeat examination and stepwise laboratory and radiographic evaluation. One should realize that a painful limp can be caused by something as mundane as a thorn in the heel or as serious as a tumor of the spine: Be suspicious.
CD008686,0,1991293,0,Radiation therapy in metastatic spinal cord compression. A prospective analysis of 105 consecutive patients.,"One hundred thirty consecutive patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) were entered in a therapeutic protocol in which radiation therapy (RT) played the main role. When MSCC is diagnosed by clinical-radiologic methods such as myelography with or without computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), steroids are given and RT treatment started within 24 hours. When diagnostic doubts exist or stabilization is necessary, surgery precedes RT. Chemohormonal potentially responsive tumors are also treated with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Twelve patients (9.2%) underwent surgery plus RT, and 118 (90.8%) received RT alone. Thirteen (11%) early death patients were not evaluable. The 105 evaluable cases that received RT alone were analyzed. Median follow-up was 15 months (range, 4 to 38 months). Response among patients with back pain was 80%. In cases with motor dysfunction, 48.6% improved, and in 33 of 105 patients (31.4%) without motor disability there was no deterioration. Forty percent of patients with autonomic dysfunction responded to RT. Median survival time was 7 months with a 36% probability of survival for 1 year. The median duration of improvement was 8 months. The most important prognostic factor was early diagnosis. Radiosensitivity of tumor was only important in paraparetic patients in predicting response to RT. Complete myelographic block significantly diminished response to RT. Vertebral collapse did not influence response or survival."

Among the 15 cases followed for 5-6 years, 10 were completely cured, 4 cured and resumed work with only some mild symptoms, and one with partial improvement. No recurrence was found. It was emphasized that neurilemomas in the spinal canal may often be confused with protrusion of intervertebral disc because of similar clinical manifestations. The author's suggestion is that in patients with progressively increasing severe pain, scattered points of tenderness on the back, multiple nerve root symptoms or even with saddle numbness, and repeated poor treatment results, further examinations such as CSF, myelography, and if necessary, CT scan should be undertaken for proper diagnosis."
CD008686,0,1827529,0,Common causes of low back pain in children.,"Low back pain in children and adolescents is often caused by a serious problem. The diagnostic investigation should begin with a complete patient history, complete physical examination, laboratory testing, and plain radiography. These results should be used to direct further imaging studies. Although most of the painful injuries that children sustain in recreational activities are mild, back pain that lasts for extended periods may be due to various disorders, including spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis, disk herniation, Scheuermann disease, or neoplasms. Low back pain can also be caused by diskitis and osteomyelitis, most commonly found in children younger than 10 years old. Primary osseous neoplasms of the lumbar spine are uncommon, with Ewing sarcoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, benign osteoblastoma, and osteoid osteoma being the most common followed by primary lymphoma. These lesions occur more often between the ages of 5 and 20 years. Other causes of low back pain include spinal cord tumors (eg, ependymoma), congenital disorders of the spine (eg, scoliosis), and systemic disease (eg, sickle cell disease)."

Both cases did not show any direct neoplastic cell invasion of the spinal cord. Pathologically, diffuse and random necrosis was found in the spinal cord in both cases. In the case of ATL, small numbers of inclusion bodies in the nerve cell nuclei were demonstrated. Using polyclonal and also monoclonal antibodies, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) was clearly demonstrated in the spinal cord in both cases. By electron microscopy, numerous herpes virus particles were observed in the spinal cord in both cases. The usefulness of electrophysiological studies should be emphasized in the differentiation of these cases from others which might also display flaccid paraplegia. The possibility of necrotizing myelopathy caused by HSV-2 should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of spinal cord diseases displaying flaccid paraplegia."
CD008686,0,2060246,0,[A case of epidural lipomatosis presenting spinal ataxia].,"A 41-year-old man was doing well until July 1989, when he noted numbness over soles, followed 4 months later by difficulty in walking. These symptoms were progressively getting worse, and he was admitted to our department on June 12, 1990. General physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologically cranial nerves were intact except old right, traumatic strabismus. Muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes were normal throughout, but bilateral Babinski and Chaddock reflexes were present. Mild weakness of lower extremities were found on muscle testing (4/5). In sensory system, superficial sensory disturbance below T10 was seen, and markedly diminished vibration and position senses of lower extremities were noted. Cerebellar test was intact, although unsteadiness was found on heel-shin test. Romberg sign was definitely positive. His gait was wide-based and ataxic. Laboratory data showed no abnormalities in CBC, chemistry, urinalysis, serological tests and endocrinological examinations. Spinal MRI (Siemens 1.5 Tesla) showed abnormal deposition of epidural fatty tissues compressing spinal cord with flattening of cord from T4 to T8. Spinal ataxia as compressive myelopathy due to epidural lipomatosis was considered and he underwent laminectomy from T4 to T8 with improvement in walking. Epidural lipomatosis is an unusual cause of spinal cord compression, presenting compressive myelopathy, radiculopathy, cauda equina syndrome, intermittent claudication, or back pain. Most of cases were associated with long-term administration of adrenocortical steroid hormone, or underlying diseases, except only 3 cases including ours. This is the first case of spinal epidural lipomatosis presenting progressive gait disturbance due to spinal ataxia."
CD008686,0,2023360,0,[What has tuberculosis medical care contributed to modern medicine in Japan].,"About 40 years ago, we had a huge number of tuberculosis patients which were about three to five millions. And a great deal of effort has been given in order to conquer tuberculosis. The philosophy and the technology used in there efforts are thought to have made considerable contributions to the development of modern medicine in other fields in Japan. The controlled clinical trial used to test new antituberculous agents has been a basis for a modern judgment on the effectiveness of any new drugs and it has brought good clinical practices. Scientific procedures for diagnosis, bronchoscopy and pulmonary function tests started in the field of tuberculosis to have more detailed diagnosis included differential one, preoperative evaluation, and evaluation for respiratory failure. Philosophy and methods of modern rehabilitation for the patients started from the care for the patient with pulmonary tuberculosis. Occupational therapy has been used for confirmation of curability of tuberculosis and restoration of the physical strength. Physiotherapy also started from exercises preventing deformities of the thorax after thoracoplasty. Terminal care for patients with cancer and other incurable diseases is now most new medical way, but in the field of tuberculosis before chemotherapeutic era, these were good experiences for this kind of care. A pain control using morphine or cocaine for spinal caries and laryngeal tuberculosis, and also telling the truth to the patients were the good examples. Holistic medicine, which is also a modern topic, has been considered in tuberculosis medical care, because the disease has so much psycho-social problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Stability at the cranio-cervical junction had been impaired by a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis in 12 patients. Metastatic tumour in 5 patients and post-operative swan neck deformity in one patient. In all patients immediate stabilization as well as long-term bony fusion could be achieved, paralleled by improvement of the preoperative neurological condition in differing degrees. Surgery related complications were rare, although, considering the patient population treated, medical and anaesthesiological complications as a result of accompanying diseases may pose serious problems. The technical details of the surgical procedure are described and its application for the treatment of cranio-cervical instability is discussed."
CD008686,0,2057987,0,Clinical pharmacokinetics of morphine.,"Morphine (M) is recommended by the World Health Organization as the treatment of choice for moderate-to-severe cancer pain. Development of sensitive radioimmunoassays (RIA) and high-performance liquid chromatography in the past 20 years has allowed study of the pharmacokinetics of M, which remain incompletely understood. Data derived by RIA must be interpreted with caution due to cross-reactivity with anti-sera by metabolites, impairing assay specificity. The pharmacokinetics of M have been determined for various clinical situations, but there is large interpatient variability for most parameters. M is readily absorbed from all routes of administration, except transdermal, and it can be injected spinally. Peak plasma levels are achieved within 15-20 min of intramuscular and subcutaneous administration, and within 30-90 min after oral. Peak levels after oral administration are much lower than after parenteral routes, since oral M undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. With repeated administration, the oral-parenteral relative potency ratio is 1:3 M can be administered epidurally or intrathecally and has also been given intracerebroventricularly. Epidural M enters the subarachnoid space, but is also absorbed into the systemic circulation. Only 5% of a dose crosses the dura. M administered in the lumbar region is quickly redistributed in the cerebrospinal fluid in a rostral direction, explaining the high incidence of systemic side effects following spinal administration. After absorption, M is rapidly and widely distributed and crosses the blood-brain barrier. With therapeutic doses, plasma protein binding is only 20-35%, and the volume of distribution is 1-6 L/kg. The primary site of M metabolism is the liver, and the dose should be reduced in patients with liver disease. Glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway, but the principal metabolite, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), is inactive. Morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) is produced in smaller amounts than M3G, but is pharmacologically active and many times more potent than M. The ratio of M6G to M in plasma, after a dose of M, is approximately 10:1, and the ratio does not change with increasing doses or prolonged treatment. Normorphine (NM) is also active, and is formed to a greater extent after oral administration; it is not, however, usually found in plasma. NM may be neurotoxic. M and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney, but urinary free M accounts for less than 10% of an administered dose. In patients with renal insufficiency, the metabolites accumulate, though M itself is still excreted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,2041250,0,[An autopsy case of adult T-cell leukemia complicated with metastatic calcification of the lung].,"46-year-old male patient was born in Niigata Prefecture and thereafter lived in Tokyo. In late January 1985, he noticed swelling of the bilateral inguinal lymph-nodes followed by fever and lumbago. In February, he consulted a local doctor and hepatosplenomegaly, marked leukocytosis and renal dysfunction were pointed out and he was referred to our hospital on February 22nd. The clinical laboratory data on admission were as follows; WBC 23,200/microliter, serum-Ca 18.4 mg/dl, BUN 85.3 mg/dl, creatinine 5.4 mg/dl, antibody to ATLV x160. ATL was diagnosed by biopsy of lymph nodes and examinations of peripheral blood and bone marrow hemogram. Remission was achieved in March by the treatment with adriacin. Renal failure and hypercalcemia also improved. However his respiratory dysfunction gradually worsened. The chest radiographies++ showed pulmonary edema, although there was no clinical evidence of heart failure. When his condition became stable, TBLB was performed and revealed extensive deposition of calcium along alveolar septae, suggesting that pulmonary edema was induced by the metastatic calcification of the lung. After the second treatment for ATL, he died of pneumonia. The autopsy showed calcium deposition not only in the lung but in pyramids of the kidney and in sub-serous layer of the small intestine. There was no tumor cell invasion into the bone or parathyroid gland. High urinary c-AMP together with normal levels of PTH suggested that the hypercalcemia in this case was induced by PTH-related protein. It was concluded that careful treatment for hypercalcemia is important as regards the occurrence of pulmonary edema."
CD008686,0,2023035,0,A review of the therapeutic concept and results of operative treatment in acute and chronic lesions of the cervical spine: the Hannover experience.,"A therapeutic concept for the treatment of acute and chronic cervical spine lesions is presented. Unstable fractures and dislocations of the cervical spine should be reduced as soon as possible. Most frequently, we employ the anterior approach using the Smith and Robinson technique (37) with the addition of an H-shaped plate. The posterior approach is mainly indicated for the release of irreducible locked facets. Unstable odontoid fractures, especially those in group II of Anderson and d'Alonzo (3), are stabilized by screw osteosynthesis. Between 1971 and 1989, 306 patients with cervical spine lesions were treated surgically. In these cases, there were 205 acute injuries and 52 chronic instabilities. Forty-nine patients had tumors or metastases. Ninety-two patients with acute injuries (group I) and 24 with chronic lesions (group II) were reexamined. Out of 53 group I patients, the neurologic symptoms improved in 45 cases (85%), and in 30 of these (mainly with radicular compression syndromes) a complete recovery was noted. Seventy-two percent of the patients were symptom-free. Seventy-four percent of the acute and 58% of the chronic lesions showed a good or very good result having little or no limitation of motion and minimal or no pain. Irrespective of neurologic deficits, 89% of the acute traumatized patients were able to work after 5 months. The rate of pseudarthrosis was 2%. The risks of an anterior interbody arthrodesis are small when using a careful and standardized operative technique. It allows an early functional treatment and shortens the rehabilitation time."
CD008686,0,2011682,0,Health effects of recreational running in women. Some epidemiological and preventive aspects.,"Estimated maximum oxygen uptake of middle-aged nonelite road race entrants is around 45 to 50 ml/kg/min, which is 40 to 100% higher than values from the female general population. Endurance training, low bodyweight, and nonsmoking of runners explain part of, but not the whole, difference in aerobic capacity observed between athletes and the general population. Sedentary women can improve cardiorespiratory fitness through aerobic exercise programmes, and the women with the lowest level of initial fitness have the highest proportional improvement following training. Regularly exercising women have a significantly reduced risk of fatal and nonfatal coronary events, and low cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with an increased risk of death and nonfatal stroke. The influence of habitual running on the female blood lipid profile is not clear. Cross-sectional studies have found elevated HDL cholesterol concentrations in distance runners, but intervention studies on the effect of jogging on lipid and lipoprotein levels have provided equivocal results. A higher level of physical fitness is associated with a lower risk to subsequently develop hypertension. Experimental studies have shown that moderate intensity aerobic exercise (40 to 60% VO2max) is able to reduce blood pressure significantly in hypertensive subjects. An athletic lifestyle may be associated with a reduced risk of adult-onset diabetes mellitus (via an exercise-induced increase in insulin-sensitivity), and with a reduced risk of cancers of the reproductive system, breast, and colon. Recreational running is also correlated with better weight control. Surveys of recreational and elite distance runners show a great variability in the prevalence of secondary amenorrhoea, between 1 and 44%. Environmental factors determining the risk of amenorrhoea in runners are low body fat content, mileage, and nutritional inadequacy, with low intakes of calories, protein, and fat. Amenorrhoeic athletes in their third and fourth decade have lower vertebral bone density, which is improved after resumption of menses but does not completely reach age-specific average values. Regardless of menstrual status, the effectiveness of exercise to maintain bone mass throughout life is an important issue. Habitual exercise is associated with increased bone density of the spine both in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Several controlled training studies suggest that postmenopausal women may at least retard their bone loss with regular aerobic exercise. Running-related injuries and complaints are common in recreational joggers, even though the reported 1-year incidence, varying between 14 and approximately 50%, depends on injury definition. Mileage and a history of previous running injury are known risk factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,1991739,0,Spinal instability secondary to metastatic cancer.,"Fifty-five patients with severe pain from spinal instability secondary to metastatic cancer were referred to Hope Hospital, none being judged to be in a terminal condition. One patient had too extensive disease for surgery so 54 were treated by 55 spinal stabilisations; 49 obtained complete relief of pain and two had partial relief. There were three failures. Twenty-eight of the patients had clinical evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression and were decompressed at the time of stabilisation. Of these, 20 had major recovery of neurological function. Patients with pre-operative evidence of extradural tumour had 'prophylactic' decompression at the time of stabilisation; none of these patients later developed signs of cord or cauda equina compression. The results suggest that alleviation of pain and restoration of mobility are best achieved by segmental spinal stabilisation; a few patients require a combined anterior and posterior stabilisation. Postoperative radiotherapy should be given whenever possible, and the causative tumour should be treated by endocrine or chemotherapy, as indicated."
CD008686,0,1990254,0,Childhood malignant lymphoma of bone.,"From 1974 to 1987, 450 children with non-Hodgkins' lymphoma (NHL) were seen at the Institut Gustave Roussy (IGR); 14 children had malignant lymphoma of bone (MLB). Eleven of the 14 were newly diagnosed, whereas three presented in relapse. Nine patients presented with multifocal bone involvement. The median age of these eight girls and six boys was 9.5 years (range 1.25-15 years). Bone pain was present in all patients as the initial symptom. Evaluation included physical examination, routine serum chemistries, complete blood count, chest roentgenography, skeletal survey, radionuclide bone scan, lumbar puncture, bone marrow aspiration, and intravenous pyelography, and/or abdominal ultrasonography. Hypercalcemia was found in six patients. Biopsy was performed in 12 patients, revealing high-grade lymphoblastic lymphomas in all. In two patients diagnosis was made on cytological examination of bone marrow aspirate. Immunophenotyping in four cases, demonstrated non-B, non-T cell origin in three and pre-B cell origin in one. Three patients were treated prior to 1982 with Cyclophosphamide/Oncovin/Prednisone/ADriamycin (COPAD) and seven patients, seen after 1982, were treated with a modified LSA2L2 protocol (LMT). None of the previously untreated patients received radiotherapy. All patients treated with COPAD have died, whereas four out of seven treated with LMT are alive with a median follow up of 51 months (range 36-82 months). One child treated on a pilot study died. One of the three children seen at relapse is disease-free with a follow-up of 98 months after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Five out of six patients presenting with hypercalcemia have died. Results with LMT are encouraging and together with published results suggest that sufficiently intensive chemotherapy can result in complete remission and cure in MLB. Radiotherapy does not seem to be necessary, avoiding possible serious long-term effects. Hypercalcemia is a bad prognostic feature."
CD008686,0,1984504,0,Idiopathic and glucocorticoid-induced spinal epidural lipomatosis.,"Pathological overgrowth of the epidural fat in the spine has been described and reported nearly exclusively in patients either with Cushing's syndrome or on chronic intake of glucocorticoids for a variety of clinical disorders. The authors report four patients with documented spinal lipomatosis (three pathologically and one radiologically). Only one of these patients received corticosteroids, and none had an underlying endocrinological abnormality. All four patients were adult males with a mean age at onset of symptoms of 43 years (range from 18 to 60 years). The symptoms ranged from simple neurogenic claudication and radicular pain to frank myelopathy. Myelography followed by computerized tomography were instrumental in the diagnosis of the first three patients; the fourth was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. The thoracic spine was involved in two cases and the lumbosacral area in the other two. The different treatment modalities were tailored according to the symptomatology of the patients. These included weight reduction of an overweight patient with minimal neurological findings in one case and decompressive laminectomy and fat debulking to achieve adequate cord decompression in the remaining three cases. Two patients improved significantly, the condition of one stabilized, and the fourth required a second decompression at other spinal levels. The various modalities of treatment and their potential complications are discussed."
CD008686,0,1961137,0,Midazolam premedication for pediatric bone marrow aspiration and lumbar puncture.,"The ability of midazolam, a benzodiazepine, to reduce the distress associated with lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration was examined in 23 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Patients were randomized to receive 0.2 mg/kg midazolam HCl or placebo intravenously 3-5 min before the procedures, under double-blind conditions. Based on prior experiences, children in both groups anticipated severe pain from these procedures. Postprocedure pain ratings by patients were markedly reduced in the midazolam but not the placebo group. Both physicians and parents judged the midazolam group as significantly less distressed than controls during and after the procedures. Trained observers recorded significantly fewer pain- and anxiety-related behaviors in the midazolam group immediately before and after, but not during the procedures. The amnestic effects of midazolam, confirmed in a visual recall/recognition test, appear to account for the decreased pain ratings since the behavioral manifestations were similar in the two groups. There were no adverse drug reactions or significant changes in vital signs. Midazolam warrants further investigation as a premedication for painful diagnostic and treatment procedures in children with cancer."
CD008686,0,1935866,0,An investigation of cognitive-behavior therapy combined with oral valium for children undergoing painful medical procedures.,"In previous research, a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) package was found to be effective in reducing children's distress associated with the painful medical procedures of bone marrow aspirations (BMAs) and lumbar punctures (LPs). Orally administered Valium demonstrated less effectiveness but was helpful in reducing behavioral distress before the medical procedure. In the present study, we investigated whether the combination of oral Valium and CBT would result in increased efficacy of the CBT. Eighty-three subjects were randomly assigned to receive either CBT or CBT plus Valium while undergoing either a BMA or an LP. Dependent variables included observed behavioral distress, self-reported fear and pain, and pulse rate. Results failed to support the value of such a combination but did provide additional evidence in regard to the effectiveness of the CBT. The need for more potent medical interventions for some children is discussed."

All patients presented with typical trigeminal neuralgia and low-density area in the parapontine region on CT-scans. Neurologically in all cases slight hypaesthesia in various divisions of the trigeminal nerve without other neurological signs was revealed. Trigeminal pain was completely relieved after surgery in all patients. Facial sensory disturbances and pain occur in patients with parapontine epidermoid tumour as a result of direct tumourous compression (and hypothetically toxic effects on the nerve root from the tumourous contents).
CD008686,0,1849335,0,Peripheral nervous system and spinal cord involvement in lymphoma.,"Nine-hundred-eighty-nine patients with diagnosis of lymphoma were studied. Forty-six cases (4.6%) had compressions of the spinal cord or roots. Forty-two patients (4.2%) had Herpes zoster virus infections, which in 6 cases were of disseminated type. The major predisposing factors for infection were: advanced stage of lymphoma, previous systemic chemotherapy and splenectomy. Toxic polyneuropathy secondary to chemotherapy was found in 39 patients (3.9%). In 14 cases, the polyneuropathic symptoms were the main complaint (Group 1), while in the remaining 25 cases the diagnosis was made during neurological consultations because of unrelated symptoms (Group 2). Both groups did not have significant differences in the total dose of chemotherapy received. The electrophysiological studies showed an axonal neuropathy in both groups. The discontinuation of chemotherapy was found to be a limiting factor in the appearance of neuropathic symptoms. Other less frequent forms of involvement were: compression of peripheral nerves or nerve plexi from lymphadenopathies (3 cases), radiation myelopathy (1 case), and Guillain-Barré Syndrome associated with Hodgkin's Lymphoma (1 case)."
CD008686,0,1839861,0,[Osteoid osteoma of the spine. The experience of the Rizzoli Institute].,"The authors report their experience at the Rizzoli Institute in treating osteoid osteomas localized to the spine (40 cases). This clinical study confirms that osteoid osteomas are tumors of adolescence, which are often diagnosed late due to their spinal localization. The role of additional investigations, dominated by bone scan and computed tomography is discussed. Their use should decrease the diagnosis delay. Mean follow-up in this series was 4 years, and confirmed that surgical excision had a favorable outcome. The outcome of associated scoliosis was also studied (8 cases). After tumor excision, there were 6 complete or partial corrections. Two cases remained unchanged. Curvature worsening after excision was not encountered."
CD008686,0,1830297,0,Vertebral compression fractures at the onset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a child.,"A child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, spinal osteoporosis with vertebral compression fractures, and hypercalcemia appearing early in the course of the hematologic disease was followed for two and a half years. Bone mineral density (BMD), measured by single photon absorptiometry at the radial shaft, was within normal limits for age and sex. However, x-rays of vertebrae and vertebral BMD, measured by dual photon absorptiometry, showed marked demineralization. Despite leukemic remission, the spinal osteoporosis became worse and the patient required aggressive treatment for eight months. Treatment included 50 units of calcitonin subcutaneously every other day, 1,000 mg/day of oral calcium, and 3,000 IU/day of vitamin D. The back pain disappeared quickly, and laboratory controls showed a significant diminution of bone turnover. No new compression fractures occurred. Eighteen months later, the patient continued in remission and menarche had occurred. Dual photon absorptiometry revealed a significant ""catch up"" of the lumbar spine BMD. X-ray examination showed a marked remodeling of the vertebral bodies. BMD measurements in this child indicate that bone loss affected the trabecular bone compartment or occurred only at active bone marrow sites. The rapid clinical amelioration and objective biochemical, densitometric, and radiologic evidence of bone improvement warrant further clinical trials on similarly affected patients."
CD008686,0,1799143,0,CNS involvement in Ewing's sarcoma. A report of 12 cases.,"Ewing's sarcoma is one of the malignant bone tumours, which occurs in various bones of the body. When the spinal column or skull bones are involved, it may cause spinal cord compression or brain invasion. In this study, 12 cases of Ewing's sarcoma with central nervous system (CNS) involvement are presented. Seven of them were male and five female. In seven of the cases tumoural mass was located in the spinal column, whereas in the others it was found in the cranium. The major complaints were motor weakness in the lower extremities in seven cases, and a mass on the cranial vault in four cases. On neurological examination, eight of the patients had impairment of movements of the extremities (67%), and seven had sensory loss (58%). All except one patient underwent surgery. In seven cases, decompressive laminectomy plus subtotal tumour excision was performed, in three, craniectomy with grossly total tumour excision, and in one, biopsy. In this report, age and sex distribution, complaints, clinical and laboratory findings, neurological examination, and histopathology of our cases are reviewed and surgical results are compared with others reported in the literature."
CD008686,0,1798918,0,[Computerized tomography in neurologic syndromes associated with spinal osteochondrosis].,Clinical and CT findings were compared for 96 patients with neurological symptoms of lumbar osteochondrosis. They revealed correlations between the severity of clinical signs and the degree of the disk prolapse. This relationship was not absolute as there were cases with stable disk prolapse in variable neurologic symptoms. Spinal CT proved most effective in differentiation from cancer and detailed featuring of degenerative--dystrophic changes for scheduled surgical treatment of spinal osteochondrosis.

Two patients are reported, who had relief of pain, but also experienced neurological complications. One patient succumbed to pulmonary complications, which provided the opportunity for anatomic analysis of the lesioned area, which is discussed in detail. Potential modifications of the surgical technique are suggested."
CD008686,0,1762720,0,Ophthalmic complications in patients with paranasal sinus mucopyoceles.,"We examined 45 (23 male and 22 female) Japanese patients with paranasal sinus mucopyoceles associated with ophthalmic complications. The patients ranged in age from 31 to 87 years. The patient distribution by the affected sinus was as follows: maxillary sinus alone, 17 patients; ethmoidal sinus alone, 9 patients; frontoethmoidal sinuses, 9 patients; frontal sinus alone, 7 patients, and other multiple sinuses, 3 patients. Thirty-nine mucoceles and 6 pyoceles were identified. Ophthalmic signs and symptoms included lid swelling, ocular pain, pseudoptosis, proptosis, displacement of the eyeball, epiphora, slight blurring of vision, severely decreased visual acuity, visual field abnormality, diplopia, disk edema, retinoichoroidal folds and increased intraocular pressure. Of the 45 patients, 1 had a history of sinus trauma and 29 had a history of sinus surgery."
CD008686,0,1720013,0,An evaluation of the potential cost reductions resulting from the use of clodronate in the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the breast to bone.,"The reported studies of clodronate in the management of osteolytic bone metastases suggest a significant palliative role for this drug. In this paper we report on analysis of the hospital costs associated with the management of osteolytic metastatic disease, and an estimate of the potential cost/benefit impact of clodronate therapy. Two separate patient populations were assessed retrospectively. The first, a sample of 120 patients with symptomatic bone metastases who had died from metastatic breast cancer over the period 1980-1990, was used to define the natural history of the disease. A second non-concurrent patient group of 337 patients was evaluated to determine the mean cost of all hospital admissions for patients with bone metastases from breast carcinoma. The length of stay and costs for hospital admissions related to the bone metastases were also assessed, in addition to the cost of out-patient radiation therapy. Our cost/benefit value analysis suggests that there are significant savings to be gained from the use of clodronate if a 20% or greater reduction occurs in the incidence of fractures, hypercalcaemia, and hospital-based treatment for pain control (via radiotherapy). We also speculate that the quality of life of patients with osteolytic bone metastases may be improved with this agent."
CD008686,0,1720012,0,Treatment of skeletal disease in breast cancer with clodronate.,"Complications of breast cancer involving the skeleton include hypercalcaemia, bone pain and fracture. These complications arise because of progressive osteolysis which is in turn dependent on the activation of osteoclasts by tumour and host tissues. Clodronate is a powerful inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption which led us to evaluate its potential in metastatic breast cancer. When given intravenously it lowers serum calcium in the majority of hypercalcaemic patients. A convenient regimen is 600 mg iv as a single dose infused over several hours. We have additionally shown in a double-blind cross-over study that this regimen also has a significant effect on bone pain. This had led us to assess the longer term effects of clodronate by mouth in a prospective double-blind study of patients with established skeletal metastases. These studies are not yet complete but the agent appears to prevent hypercalcaemia and trends are emerging which indicate that the incidence of bone pain and fractures may also decrease."
CD008686,0,1664016,0,Localized Larmor frequency-guided fat and water proton MRI of the spine: a method to emphasize pathological findings.,"A measurement protocol providing a correct adjustment of the irradiation frequencies for well separated fat and water images of the lumbar spine is presented. To determine accurately the Larmor frequencies of water and fat protons within the vertebral bodies, a volume selective spectrum of a volume element (13 mm)3 located in a lumbar vertebral body was acquired with the 90 degrees-180 degrees-180 degrees double spin-echo method. These Larmor frequencies are used to adjust the frequency-selective pulse of the SENEX chemical-shift imaging sequence. This procedure provides well separated fat and water images for a large field of view even in the inhomogeneous region of the vertebral column. Their clinical importance is demonstrated by localized Larmor frequency-guided (LLFG) SENEX 1H images of the lumbar spine in healthy persons of different age and in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia."

CD008686,0,2292629,0,A stress inoculation program for parents whose children are undergoing painful medical procedures.,"The efficacy of a stress inoculation intervention program was compared with that of a child focused intervention program in helping parents cope with their children's painful medical procedures. Ss included 72 parents (79% mothers) of pediatric leukemia patients (aged 3-12 years) who were undergoing either bone marrow aspirations (n = 28) or lumbar punctures (n = 44). Parents were assessed during a baseline procedure and then were randomly assigned to either a stress inoculation group or a child-focused intervention group. In the child focused intervention, parents merely observed their child's participation in a cognitive behavior therapy program. Assessment of parents included an observation measure of parent behavior, self-reported measures of anxiety and coping, and physiological measures. Results indicate that parents in the stress inoculation program reported lower anxiety scores and higher positive self-statement scores than did parents in the child-focused intervention."
CD008686,0,2275663,0,Pitfalls in headache management.,"The diagnosis of serious causes of headache depends on a careful history, a high index of suspicion of the unusual presentations and the judicious use of CT scanning. It is important not to overlook subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage, meningitis, cerebral tumours, cerebral malformations and giant cell arteritis. Iatrogenic causes such as drugs and spinal procedures should also be considered."

Initial evaluation suggested a lumbar spine tumor, but myelography confirmed the presence of an epidural abscess. Further evaluation revealed a duodeno-spinal fistula at the site of the previous duodenal ulcer, which proved to be the cause of the abscess."
CD008686,0,2149206,0,Osteoblastoma of the spine. A review of 75 cases.,"Clinical and radiologic features of 75 cases of osteoblastoma of the spine were reviewed. In addition to pain, which was the most frequent complaint, 18 patients demonstrated objective neurologic deficit, while scoliosis was observed in 17 patients. Aspirin yielded pain relief in 13 patients. Pathologic fracture was not encountered. The radiologic and histologic characteristics of osteoblastoma of the spine are indistinguishable from those arising in other sites. The typical lesion exhibited a well-defined, geographic margin with a sclerotic, frequently lobulated border. Approximately one half of the cases were predominantly lucent, the remainder displaying varying degrees of matrix mineralization. Distribution of the osteoblastomas through the spinal axis was as follows: cervical-29, thoracic-16, lumbar-17, sacral-13. Other significant findings included posterior element involvement in 73 of 75 cases, and a striking male to female ratio of 2.5 to 1."
CD008686,0,2134451,0,Magnetic resonance imaging and posttraumatic Lhermitte's sign.,"Two patients developed Lhermitte's sign after cervical spine fractures. The patients were otherwise without evidence of spinal cord dysfunction. Both patients were studied with magnetic resonance scans of the cervical spine. The magnetic resonance scans were normal. The possible etiology of Lhermitte's sign in these patients is discussed. The differential diagnosis including cervical spondylosis, combined systems degeneration, multiple sclerosis, neoplasm, and radiation myelopathy is reviewed. These patients should be carefully evaluated clinically, and flexion/extension lateral cervical spine films as well as a complete blood count and peripheral smear should be obtained. Magnetic resonance scanning may have an important role in evaluating these patients. Magnetic resonance is exquisitely sensitive in detecting demyelination; therefore, we speculate that subarachnoid scarring may be responsible for this symptom. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance scanning may confirm the presence of such scarring in the future."
CD008686,0,2099873,0,[Neurological diseases in the aged].,"In this paper, I described clinical and basic problems on neurology of the aged patients. These studies have been done in various institutions with many co-workers. 1) A PET study revealed some age differences on CBF, CMRO2, or CMRgl. But these results are not so rigid in which much of individual variations should be considered in interpretation. Calendar age is not always compatible to biological age. 2) Saccular aneurysms in the brain artery were found in 7.3% of 1200 routine autopsy series of the aged subjects. Aneurysms with external diameter exceeding 6 mm had been fatally ruptured in 14 (78%) of 18 subjects. 3) Variations of the pyramidal crossing are found responsible for bizarre clinical manifestations. Non-crossing component was more prominent in the right pyramidal tract; consequently, right pyramidal tracts including ventral and lateral one seemed to have more extensive representation in the spinal cord level. 4) I123-IMP SPECT study showed a reduced uptake in the area 4 or area 4-6 of the ALS patients. 5) I introduced a new simplified Wartenberg's maneuver, which is useful for detection of subtle pyramidal dysfunctions. 6) Cases with central pontine myelinolysis and those of paraneoplastic syndrome were presented with an emphasis on their patho-chemical mechanisms. 7) Lewis-Sumner syndrome showing multifocal persistent conduction block is not rare in the aged, in which we have already had some useful therapeutic methods. 8) Dementia complicated with neurodegenerative disease was discussed on its clinical and chemical features of mental disturbances. In ALS-dementia, CSF-homovanilic acid reduced significantly than in the control and L-dopa was effective in some patients. 9) Vascular and Alzheimer-type dementias were presented and discussed on their pathogenetic mechanism according to our recent studies with review of literature."
CD008686,0,2086737,0,"Leptomeningeal metastases: comparison of clinical features and laboratory data of solid tumors, lymphomas and leukemias.","We reviewed 63 cases of cytologically confirmed leptomeningeal metastases (LM). 31 (49%) had solid tumors 17 (27%) had leukemia and 15 (24%) had lymphoma. The most common presenting symptom was pain (76%) with radicular discomfort (58%), headache (32%), neck or back pain (17%). The predominant neurological signs were mental status abnormalities (49%), weakness (47%), seizures (14%). The mode of presentation varied with tumor type. Patients with leukemia (18%) and lymphoma (13%) tended to present frequently with LM without systemic involvement, or during periods of apparent remission (leukemia 35%, lymphoma 27%), while patients with solid tumors had established systemic metastases (90%) at time of presentation. Laboratory studies did not vary among the groups. 71% had positive cytology on the first lumbar puncture (LP) and only 8% required more than 2 LPs. The cell count was a poor predictor of positive cytology as 29% of LP's with positive cytology and 36% of all LP's had less than 4 cells/mm. We conclude that 1) LM presents with pain and seizures more frequently than has been previously recognized; 2) LM is frequently the mode of presentation in patients with leukemia and lymphoma and; 3) cytology is positive frequently in CSF specimens with normal cell counts and chemistries."
CD008686,0,2082001,0,Does ambulatory blood pressure monitoring improve the diagnosis of secondary hypertension?,"Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can determine the average blood pressure level and the short- and long-term blood pressure variability (circadian rhythm). The circadian blood pressure rhythm appears to be mediated mainly by the circadian rhythm of the sympathetic tone which is linked to changes in physical and mental activity, e.g. the waking-sleeping cycle. A statistically significant circadian blood pressure rhythm was observed in approximately 80% of mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients as well as in normal subjects. However, in patients with Cushing's syndrome, under glucocorticoid treatment, or with hyperthyroidism, central and/or peripheral autonomic dysfunction (Shy-Drager syndrome, spinal cord injury, brainstem lesions, diabetic neuropathy, uremic neuropathy, etc), chronic renal failure, eclampsia, malignant hypertension, sleep apnea syndrome or systemic atherosclerosis, the normal circadian blood pressure rhythm appears to be eliminated or reversed, while in those with primary aldosteronism, renovascular hypertension, pheochromocytoma without paroxysmal hypertension, diabetes insipidus, acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism or hyperprolactinemia, the nocturnal blood pressure fall has been observed as in normal subjects. The alteration in the circadian blood pressure rhythm was observed with different pathophysiological conditions, although no specific pattern was observed for any condition. A disturbance in any part of the hierarchy of factors that regulate the circadian rhythm of sympathetic neural tone seems to disturb the circadian blood pressure rhythm. We conclude that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is not critically important in the diagnosis of secondary hypertension although it does help in screening for secondary hypertension."
CD008686,0,1964961,0,Polyradiculopathy in leptomeningeal metastasis: the role of EMG and late response studies.,"Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) of systemic malignancy often give rise to multifocal involvement of the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous system. Signs of CNS dysfunction such as seizures and confusion often overshadow radicular deficits. We report clinical and laboratory evaluations in 10 patients with LM who presented with isolated polyradiculopathy. Our data suggest that electromyography and late response studies are sensitive indicators of radicular dysfunction in patients with LM. These studies are helpful in the early documentation of root involvement when computerized tomography, MRI and myelography are normal."
CD008686,0,1704880,0,Palliative radiotherapy.,"We have reviewed the role of radiation therapy in the palliative treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The use of radiation treatment results in effective palliation of chest symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and chest pain. In addition, the pain and suffering associated with skeletal and hepatic metastases are effectively alleviated by radiation therapy with minimal morbidity. Devastating neurologic complications can be avoided or alleviated in a great proportion of patients undergoing radiation therapy for cerebral metastases and spinal cord compression. Therefore, radiation therapy is a potent modality in relieving or reducing the suffering of patients with lung cancer. This is also a modality that has wide applicability; very few patients are not suitable candidates for that has wide applicability; very few patients are not suitable candidates for treatment regardless of their performance status. The aim of the treatments should always be prompt intervention using radiation therapy schedules that will minimize treatment time yet produce the desired results in a high proportion of patients. Protracted radiation schedules are not warranted in such patients except in special clinical situations. Palliation with radiation therapy is achieved quite promptly, with minimal side effects and a very small risk of any long-term consequences in patients who have a limited life expectancy."
CD008686,0,2287121,0,[A case of carcinosarcoma originating from the renal pelvis].,"The first case of carcinosarcoma originating from the renal pelvis in Japan is reported. A fifty-five year old woman was admitted to the hospital on July 13, 1987, complaining of a one-year history of lumbago. On physical examination, a mass of child's head size was palpable in the right loin. There were other palpable masses in the posterior head (8 x 8 cm), left anterior chest (3 x 3 cm) and sacral region (3 x 3 cm). A chest X-ray showed multiple pulmonary metastases and an excretory urogram revealed a non-visualizing right kidney. Computed tomogram and renal angiogram suggested right renal tumor. Right renal arterial embolization with ethanol sclerosing was performed. She had previously undergone biopsy of the sacral lesion at another hospital, histological examinations of which pointed to suspected carcinosarcoma. She was treated by a combination chemotherapy with vincristine, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide. Despite one course of chemotherapy, her general condition deteriorated with progression of metastatic lesions in the regions other than the lungs. She died of the disease on december 9, 1987. Autopsy was performed. Sections of the right kidney showed a transitional cell carcinoma in-situ with squamous and glandular differentiation in addition to the chondrosarcoma. The metastases were found in the liver, lung and bone, all of which consisted of chondrosarcoma. On the other hand skin metastases consisted of both carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements. The pathological specimens were reviewed at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, D.C."
CD008686,0,2283523,0,Touch and surgical division of the anterior quadrant of the spinal cord.,"An investigation was carried out to determine whether tactile sensibility was affected by anterolateral cordotomy. There were 65 patients who had cordotomies for painful forms of cancer. Thirty eight had necropsy examination with histological investigation of the spinal cord. No form of mechanoreception was removed in any of the 65 patients and in the majority no forms of tactile sensibility were altered by division of the pathways in the anterolateral and anterior columns. In no case was graphaesthesia affected. Knowledge of joint position and movement and awareness of vibration was normal in 62 of the 65 patients. But information carried by these anterolateral pathways does reach neural levels of consciousness, for with total lesions of the posterior columns, previously reported, touch and pressure are still felt. Itch was removed by division of the anterolateral pathways. Although the posterior columns are essential for discrimination in mechanoreception, discrimination may be disturbed by lesions of the anterolateral pathways, notably two-point discrimination. The evidence on the pathways essential for conveying impulses giving rise to tickle was inconclusive."
CD008686,0,2232902,0,Renal cell carcinoma associated with sarcoidlike tissue reaction.,"A 60-year-old man was referred to our institution with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Because of several months' complaint of right flank pain and weight loss, the patient had consulted his local physician. After an extensive workup revealed only cholelithiasis, he underwent a cholecystectomy for presumed chronic cholecystitis. At the time of operation, biopsy of several liver nodules and peripancreatic nodes revealed noncaseating granulomas, consistent with sarcoidosis. On initial examination at our institution, the patient had microhematuria. A chest roentgenogram demonstrated multiple pulmonary nodules, an abdominal computed tomographic scan showed an indeterminate left renal mass, and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed abnormal signals in the body of T-12. Open-lung biopsy showed an adenocarcinoma with clear cell features, likely of renal origin. The patient was diagnosed as having a metastatic renal carcinoma associated with a sarcoidlike tissue reaction. Although noncaseating granulomas have been reported in association with other malignant lesions, to our knowledge this is the first report of such an association with renal carcinoma. In addition, this case illustrates several points. First, sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder with protean extrapulmonary manifestations. In fact, all our patient's findings could have been attributed to sarcoidosis. Second, noncaseating granulomas occur with many types of processes, including infections, chemical exposures, and, as in this case, neoplasms. Thus, noncaseating granulomas are not pathognomonic for sarcoidosis. Third, sarcoidosis is a clinical diagnosis that cannot be based on histologic findings alone."

CD008686,0,2234298,0,[Anterolateral approach to giant cell tumor in T4 vertebral body].,"A case of giant cell tumor involving the Th4 vertebral body is reported. A 27-year-old man, who had a 2 month history of back pain and paraparesis, was admitted to our department in August, 1986. On the first admission, he manifested severe paraparesis and sensory disturbance below the Th5 dermatome level. Neuroradiological examination demonstrated an epidural tumor involving the Th4 vertebral body and compressing the spinal cord. Emergency laminectomy for decompression and biopsy was performed. The surgical specimen was a giant-cell tumor. 6 weeks after the first operation, total removal of the tumor and anterior fusion of the Th 3-5 with iliac bone graft was performed through the anterolateral transthoracic approach. Postoperative course was uneventful. A curative resection and immediate stabilization was thus able to be undertaken through the anterolateral transthoracic approach, when the epidural tumor was confined to the thoracic vertebral body."

CD008686,0,1701501,0,[Clinical evaluation of recombinant human G-CSF in children with cancer].,"Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF), produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells, was administered in 69 chemotherapy-induced neutropenic pediatric patients (pts) with malignant tumors. Each pt received two cycles of the same chemotherapy and had neutropenia with absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) less than 500/microliter in the first cycle. Initiating 72 hours after termination of chemotherapy in the second cycle, rG-CSF (2 micrograms/kg/day) was given subcutaneously or intravenously to each pt for 10 days. rG-CSF significantly increased ANC at nadir; 72 +/- 14 vs. 206 +/- 40/microliter (data in the first cycle vs. data in the second cycle, respectively), and reduced the period of neutropenia with ANC less than 500/microliter; 9.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.6 days, and the period for restoration to ANC greater than or equal to 1,000/microliter after initiation of chemotherapy; 25.5 +/- 0.6 vs 17.5 +/- 0.9 days. rG-CSF did not affect other components of peripheral blood. The number of days with fever greater than or equal to 38 degrees C was significantly reduced by rG-CSF treatment. Neck pain and lumbago were observed in one pt, pollakisuria in one pt, and elevation of the serum levels of LDH and uric acid in one pt, however these were mild to moderate, transient, and resolved without any specific treatment. We concluded that rG-CSF was effective in neutropenia induced by intensive chemotherapy for malignant tumors without any serious side effects."
CD008686,0,2384779,0,Constant infusion of morphine for intractable cancer pain using an implanted pump.,"In the past, pain control for chronic pain syndromes using narcotic infusion has been carried out primarily via the intrathecal (subarachnoid) route. This report presents one of the first large series of terminally ill cancer patients with intractable pain treated with continuous epidural morphine infusions by means of implanted pumps and epidural spinal catheters. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate that the epidural route is effective with minimal complications, and that screening with temporary epidural catheter infusions results in a high rate of subsequent pain relief. A multidisciplinary team (neurosurgeon, anesthesiologists, psychiatrists, oncologists, and nurse clinicians) evaluated and treated all of the patients studied. Percutaneous placement of temporary epidural catheters for a trial assessment was performed by the anesthesiologists. Pain evaluations were conducted independently by psychiatrists using both verbal and visual analog scales. From 1982 to 1988, 41 (59.4%) of 69 patients evaluated for eligibility experienced good pain control during trial assessment and were subsequently implanted with Infusaid infusion pumps. Preinfusion pain analog values were 8.6 +/- 0.3 and postimplantation values at 1 month were 3.8 +/- 0.4 (p less than 0.001). Over this same 1-month period. requirements of systemic morphine equivalents decreased by 79.3% with epidural infusions as compared to preinfusion requirements (p less than 0.001). There were no instances of epidural scarring, respiratory depression, epidural infections, meningitis, or catheter blockage. One patient developed apparent drug tolerance and three patients required further catheter manipulations. This series strongly suggests that significant reductions in cancer pain can be obtained with few complications and a low morphine tolerance rate using chronic epidural morphine infusion. Anesthesiology and psychiatry input, along with temporary catheter infusion screening and quantitative pain evaluations using analog scales, are essential."
CD008686,0,2384773,0,Leptomyelolipoma: analysis of 20 cases.,"Leptomyelolipoma (lumbosacral lipoma) is a common form of spinal dysraphism. The deficits produced include sensory, motor, bowel, and bladder dysfunction, and vary in incidence between the pediatric and adult populations. Twenty patients treated surgically at the Mount Sinai Hospital between 1972 and 1988 are reviewed. Fifty percent were 12 years of age or less and 50% were older than 18 years of age. The surgical approach was designed to accomplish untethering of the conus medullaris, debulking of the lipomatous mass compressing the cord, reconstruction of the dural canal, and reapproximation of the paraspinal muscles and lumbosacral fascia to prevent future trauma. Postoperatively, no patient experienced deterioration of neurological function. Of the symptomatic patients. 67% displayed dramatic improvement or became asymptomatic and 33% experienced stabilization of their deficits. The symptoms most resistant to surgical correction were orthopedic foot deformities and bowel dysfunction, whereas bladder dysfunction, motor weakness, and radiculopathies were most amenable to surgical therapy. Early surgical repair is recommended in these cases to forestall irreversible neurological damage."
CD008686,0,2118414,0,Radioactive iodine therapy: effect on functioning metastases of adenocarcinoma of the thyroid.,"A case of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the thyroid is reported in which treatment by means of radioactive iodine has been successful. The patient was completely thyroidectomized for ""malignant adenoma"" in 1923, with neither thyrotoxicosis then nor hypothyroidism postoperatively; 15 years later there developed classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism and severe pain in the lower back. In October 1939 a pulsating tumor removed from the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra proved to be metastatic thyroid adenocarcinoma (histologically well differentiated, with small follicles and colloid). In the next two years hyperthyroidism increased and roentgenograms revealed new metastases in the lungs, upper part of the right femur, second rib on the left side, left ilium, and skull. Roentgenologic irradiation of the metastases proved ineffectual. In March 1943 a tracer dose of radioactive iodine revealed iodine retention by all the known lesions and no evidence of residual thyroid tissue in the neck. Therapeutic amounts of radioactive iodine were administered orally between May and October 1943. Definite and lasting clinical improvement followed. In April 1944 and March 1945 additional I* was administered with a resultant disappearance of pain, increase in weight, and progressive change in all clinical criteria in the direction of hypothyroidism. Roentgenographic evidence pointed to an arrest if not a regression of the disease. No untoward effects followed this therapy. Radioactive iodine seems to be an effective therapeutic agent in the control of this type of tumor."
CD008686,0,2215777,0,Spinal cord compression--an oncologic emergency.,"Spinal cord compression secondary to epidural metastatic tumor is an emergency clinical situation that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment if permanent neurologic damage is to be prevented. Physicians caring for patients with cancer must maintain a high index of suspicion for this problem. Back pain is a common clinical situation in the general population but in the cancer patient, one should consider this sign indicative of possible spinal cord compression even though a long tumor-free interval has occurred since the original diagnosis of neoplasm. The diagnosis is established by thorough neurologic examination, plain x-rays, myelography, CT and MRI scanning. Once the diagnosis is established, treatment is instituted with steroids, decompressive surgery and postoperative irradiation or external irradiation alone depending upon the emergent nature of the clinical situation. Regardless of the initial treatment, patients with spinal cord compression require management in a multi-disciplinary fashion. Early therapy will result in the best relief of symptoms and maintenance of the ability to walk. The ultimate prognosis of such patients is very dismal in view of the metastatic nature of their disease but prompt diagnosis and treatment is necessary to prevent devastating sequelae for the patients and their families."
CD008686,0,2169226,0,Neurological manifestations of osteoid osteoma.,"The clinical and radiological features of 38 children with osteoid osteomas were analysed retrospectively. Twenty nine patients had lesions of the femur (n = 17) or tibia (n = 12). The mean duration from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 13.8 months. In seven patients the history of pain and abnormalities on examination suggested a possible neurological disorder. Fourteen of 29 patients (48%) with femoral or tibial osteomas had localised muscle atrophy, and 10 patients (34%) had diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes in the affected limb. Two patients had painless lesions. Six patients had normal plain radiographs. Delay in the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma may be prevented by the knowledge that pain may be referred or radicular, that the concomitant occurrence of muscle atrophy and depressed deep tendon reflexes are relatively common findings, and that the characteristic radiological features may only appear late in the course of the disease."
CD008686,0,2117904,0,[A case of Borrmann type 4 gastric carcinoma which disappeared by intraaortic infusion chemotherapy with ADM and MMC].,"A 64-year-old woman with Borrmann type 4 gastric cancer was treated by intraaortic (celiac artery) one-shot infusion chemotherapy with adriamycin (ADM) and mitomycin C (MMC). One month after the first administration of 30 mg ADM and 20 mg MMC, the second administration of 50 mg ADM and 20 mg MMC was done. The third administration of 50 mg ADM and 20 mg MMC was performed one month after the second administration. Clinical symptoms of back pain, lumbago and anorexia had almost disappeared soon after the third administration. Although the findings of the X-ray examination of stomach, gastroscopy and celiac angiography showed marked improvement, total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed 2 months after the third administration because residual cancer cell nests were highly suspect. Histological examination of the resected stomach and lymphnodes revealed no cancer cells. The patient has been in good health without any recurrent signs for 16 months after operation."
CD008686,0,2392661,0,[Osteoid osteoma of the spine and pelvic area].,"We describe 8 cases of osteoid osteoma of the spine and the pelvis. In the rare cases of this tumor the clinical symptoms are not specific. The typical nocturnal exacerbation of the pain was absent in 2 of our 8 patients. More often the main symptoms were abnormalities of the gait or deformation of the spine, partly secondary to the often absent pain. Pain relief after aspirin is described but not constant. The aspirin test was positive in 4 of our 8 cases (in 20-50% of the cases in the literature). It must be emphasized that conventional-x-ray is often not diagnostic, and therefore the diagnosis is often delayed. If there is suspicion of osteoid osteoma a technetium bone scan should be performed. CT-scan is required for preoperative evaluation. Treatment of choice is the excision of the tumor in healthy tissue, which was successful in all our 8 cases."
CD008686,0,2369300,0,Pancoast tumor presenting as cervical radiculopathy.,"A case of Pancoast tumor presenting as cervical radiculopathy is reported, including the clinical, EMG, and radiologic findings. A 64-year-old man with a two-month history of left shoulder pain and left arm numbness at the medial aspect of the hand and forearm presented for electrodiagnostic examination, and a severe C8 radiculopathy was documented. Subsequent radiologic evaluation (myelogram and routine chest x-ray) yielded the diagnosis of left apical lung tumor (Pancoast tumor), eroding through the C7 and T1 pedicles and T1 vertebral body, with cut-off of the left C8 nerve root. Pancoast tumor has long been implicated as a cause of brachial plexopathy. The EMG presentation of isolated cervical radiculopathy, however, has not been previously reported, despite the tumor's known tendency for local invasion which may include the nerve roots and even the spinal canal in its advanced stages. This patient's normal sensory studies argue against any significant coexisting lower brachial plexopathy. The possibility of Pancoast lesion should be considered not only in the presence of brachial plexopathy, but also when C8 or T1 radiculopathy is found."
CD008686,0,2359154,0,Urinary dysfunction in transverse myelitis.,"Six men and 2 women with a history of transverse myelitis and persistent lower urinary tract symptoms underwent neurourological evaluation. Of the patients, 4 were neurologically intact, while the remainder had residual neurological deficits. Urodynamic studies revealed detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia in 6 patients. Two patients had detrusor hyperreflexia, of whom 1 also had an incompetent sphincter. Erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction was reported by 3 men. We conclude that prolonged bladder and sexual dysfunction, caused by spinal cord inflammatory insult, may persist despite a systemic neurological recovery. Therefore, bladder management guided by initial and followup urodynamics is recommended."
CD008686,0,2353102,0,Extradural spinal cord compression: analysis of factors determining functional prognosis--prospective study.,"The treatment results in 59 patients with extradural spinal cord compression (ESCC) who were treated with irradiation between April 1987 and December 1988 were analyzed prospectively. Eighty percent of the patients presented with back pain, which preceded ESCC by an average of 6 weeks. The most common primary tumor was lung cancer (27% of cases), followed by prostate cancer and breast cancer. The prognostic significance of pretreatment motor function, degree of spinal cord block, radiosensitivity of tumor, and radiation dose schedule was determined with multivariate analysis. Only pretreatment motor function was found to be a significant factor in determining functional prognosis (P = .0058). Even with the increasing clinical awareness of ESCC, 78% of the patients in the current series were nonambulatory at presentation. Therefore, computed tomographic myelography or magnetic resonance imaging is recommended for patients with back pain and bone destruction at the site of the complaint if local radiation treatment is not planned."
CD008686,0,2269040,0,[Tumors of the spine: a clinical study of 80 cases].,"From February 1972 to December 1988, 80 cases of spinal tumor were treated in this hospital. 37 of these cases were primary tumor and 43 cases were secondary tumor. Most of the primary tumors were angioma and massive osteolysis, most of the metastatic tumors were from gastrointestinal and pulmonary carcinoma. The time of onset in both groups within half a year were 54.2% and 65.1% respectively. The dominant symptoms were pain, mass and paralysis. Except 4 cases which involved more than one vertebrae, all others involved only one vertebra. Primary tumours were mostly found in the sacrum (41.1%) and metastatic tumors were mostly found in the thoracic spine (65.2%). Sixty-three patients were treated by different combinations of operative methods. Eleven primary malignant tumor and 16 metastatic case had been followed-up for 3 months to 3 years, 25 cases died. The rate of misdiagnosis was 21.25%, which mainly occurred in the secondary group. The causes of misdiagnosis were analysed."
CD008686,0,2234995,0,Evaluating the efficacy of EMLA in alleviating pain associated with lumbar puncture; comparison of open and double-blinded protocols in children.,"Potential benefit of the topical anesthetic EMLA prior to lumbar puncture was studied in children with cancer. Comparison was made between 2 types of study: the first one involved 10 children who were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled study and in the second, 18 children in an open crossover study. Although both studies suggested the favourable effects of EMLA in alleviating pain associated with LP, they illustrated the need to perform such studies in a controlled blinded fashion; the effect in the double-blind study was not apparent in some cases, whereas it was clear cut in all open cases."
CD008686,0,2142033,0,Primary neoplasms of the thoracic and lumbar spine. An analysis of 29 consecutive cases.,"Primary osseous neoplasms of the thoracic and lumbar spine are uncommon lesions. Between 1965 and 1982, of 1971 patients with musculoskeletal neoplasms, only 29 (1.5%) had primary osseous tumors in these locations. There were eight children and 21 adults. Back pain was the most common complaint in 25 patients (86%), and neurologic symptoms or deficits were present in 16 patients (55%). All lesions were visible on routine spine roentgenograms, while computed tomography and myelography demonstrated spinal canal encroachment and extradural spinal cord compression in 19 patients (66%). The histologic diagnoses included 11 benign and 18 malignant lesions. Benign lesions occurred predominantly in children and malignant tumors in adults. Treatment was individualized, based on the histologic diagnoses. Twenty-two patients had surgical resection of their lesions. Laminectomy without stabilization and arthrodesis resulted in late instability and neurologic deterioration in three of seven patients (43%) with malignant lesions. Resection and decompression combined with arthrodesis did not predispose to late instability. Twenty-one patients were followed for a mean of 4.1 years (range, two to 14 years). Eight patients died from malignant disease between one month and seven years after diagnosis."
CD008686,0,2136162,0,Vascular malformations of the spinal cord and dura.,"Current techniques of diagnosis and treatment allow for earlier detection, precise delineation of the vascular anatomy, and, most important, successful treatment of most patients with spinal AVMs. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in the initial assessment of patients with progressive myelopathy but cannot replace myelography or arteriography in screening patients who may have a spinal AVM. The most common variety of spinal AVM is a dural arteriovenous fistula. Dural arteriovenous fistulas cause cord injury by producing venous congestion, and symptoms can be reversed by elimination of venous congestion of the spinal cord. Dural arteriovenous fistulas can be treated successfully by interrupting the arteriovenous fistula either in the dura or by disconnecting the dural fistula from the coronal venous plexus in the subarachnoid space. This can be done by interrupting the medullary vein that drains the arterial blood from the dural fistula into the coronal venous plexus of the spinal cord. Stripping of the engorged venous network on the surface of the spinal cord is unwarranted and may cause further cord injury. In dural arteriovenous fistulas embolization is often beneficial in patients with acute neurologic deterioration, to permit time for stabilization and improvement in spinal cord hemodynamics and in cord function before neurosurgical intervention is undertaken. Embolization also may be indicated in patients with intradural spinal AVMs in which surgery cannot be performed safely. Although embolic occlusion does not permanently occlude most intradural AVMs, it often permits stabilization of neurologic function and may be repeated later if neurologic dysfunction returns or progresses. Although the outcome after treatment is dependent on the type and location of the spinal AVM, as in most treatable neurologic disorders the functional outcome of patients with spinal AVMs is directly related to their neurologic condition at the time of treatment. Patients with minimal dysfunction, and with easily accessible AVMs, such as dural arteriovenous fistulas, have the greatest chance for useful recovery or stabilization. Since these patients represent the largest number of patients with spinal AVMs, they must be diagnosed and treated early to achieve the best possible outcome."
CD008686,0,2120742,0,Transient and chronic neurological complications of fast neutron radiation for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.,"The records of 132 patients participating in clinical trials using fast neutron (n = 94), mixed neutron and photon (n = 16), or conventional photon (n = 22) irradiation for primary management of prostatic cancer were retrospectively reviewed to assess treatment-related neurological complications. With a median follow-up of 14 months (range 1 to 101 months), 31/132 patients (26 neutron, 3 mixed beam, 2 photon) have experienced either sciatica beginning during or shortly after treatment, or diminished bladder or bowel continence that developed at a median time of 6.5 months following treatment. Sciatica responded to oral steroids and was usually self-limited, whereas sphincter dysfunction appears to be permanent. Pre-treatment risk factors for complications included a history of hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking or peripheral vascular disease, with 81% of affected patients having one or more risk factors compared with 55% of unaffected patients (p = 0.01). Seven patients have moderate (5) or severe (2) residual problems, all in the cohorts receiving neutrons (6/7) or mixed beam therapy (1/7)."
CD008686,0,1700355,0,Clinical and instrumental evaluation of sensory function before and after percutaneous anterolateral cordotomy at cervical level in man.,"Sensory perception thresholds were assessed by clinical testing and by quantitative instrumental testing before and after operation in 16 subjects for whom unilateral percutaneous cervical cordotomy was performed for the relief of pain due to malignant disease, and compared with clinical assessments of sensory function. We were able to confirm the association between deficit in pin-prick sensation and pain relief in the majority of instances, though the completeness or otherwise of pain relief does not correspond to absence of pin-prick sensation. There is no objective interference with low threshold mechanical sensation as measured instrumentally, although cordotomised subjects do not experience startle, tickle, or cutaneous erotic sensation when subjected to appropriate low intensity tactile sensation. Quantitative instrumental testing shows that the greatest deficits produced by cordotomy are in the sensations of skinfold pinch (? = tissue-damage pain) and skin cooling. The latter is transduced in the periphery by A delta fibres; sensations of warmth and hot pain, transduced by primary afferent C fibres, are much less significantly affected. Our findings thus fail to resolve the question as to whether chronic clinical pain is mainly an A delta- or a C fibre-mediated phenomenon."
CD008686,0,2356498,0,Intrathecal morphine as an adjunct to anesthesia for head and neck surgery.,"Within the past 15 years, the use of spinal opiates has gained acceptance as a means of achieving postoperative analgesia during various surgical procedures, though little has been reported concerning such use in head and neck surgery. Our experience with intrathecal morphine for eight patients who have had head and neck surgery is reviewed. Mechanisms of pain and possible sites of action of intrathecal morphine as they pertain to these patients are discussed. Adequate postoperative analgesia was achieved in seven of our eight patients. Only one patient required supplemental intravenous narcotics during the initial 24-hour postoperative period. This patient had a history of chronic narcotic use, suggesting that such patients may be tolerant to intrathecal narcotics as they are to narcotics given by other routes."
CD008686,0,2343130,0,Osteoblastoma: clinical and radiologic findings in 98 new cases.,"The data on 98 new patients with osteoblastoma were studied. The clinical features of pain, scoliosis, and neurologic deficit were largely consistent with those in previous reports. Osteoblastoma is usually a lytic lesion originating in the medulla of bones with matrix ossification and mild surrounding sclerosis. Osteoblastoma of the spine demonstrated better tumor delineation in the vertebrae, and a bony rim on the soft-tissue side was seen less frequently than previously observed. Osteoblastoma of the talus frequently appears as a blister on the surface of the bone and is accompanied by osteoporosis. In the hands and feet, the radiographic appearance is often very similar to that of aneurysmal bone cyst and giant cell tumor. In the skull it strongly resembles a button sequestrum of bone. The origin and extent of the tumor, the presence of matrix mineralization, and tumor delineation depicted as a thin bony shell are often better appreciated on computed tomographic (CT) scans. In addition, CT can demonstrate both edema and atrophy of the surrounding soft tissues. At magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, osteoblastoma demonstrates signal intensities similar to those of other bone neoplasms. In addition to the advantages offered by CT, MR imaging can help differentiate tumor tissue from accompanying edema."
CD008686,0,2151986,0,Herniated lumbar disc in patients over the age of fifty.,"Fifty patients ranging in age between 50-78 years (mean, 56) underwent surgery for a herniated lumbar disc between January 1986 and July 1988. All had objective clinical and radiographic evidence of a herniated disc. All had had failure during an appropriate period of conservative treatment. Far lateral herniation occurred in 8%, and 28% had disc herniations at L2 or L3. Surgical results were 64% excellent, 28% good, 6% fair, and 2% poor. Complications including urinary tract infection, wound infection, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism were observed in 8% of patients. Lumbar disc herniation in the elderly is common. After thorough evaluation to exclude neoplasm or infection, decompression of neural structures can lead to 90% good to excellent results. Spinal stenosis must be carefully considered both preoperatively and intraoperatively. Also, a higher incidence of more cephalad lumbar herniations and far lateral herniations was observed in older patients."
CD008686,0,2375246,0,Clinical course and long-term prognosis of acute transverse myelopathy.,"The clinical characteristics and course of acute transverse myelopathy (ATM) was studied. One patient developed multiple sclerosis. In 1 patient ATM was caused by tumour-cell embolization of the intramedullar vessels; 30 aged 12-74 years (median 36 years) had ATM of unknown course, of these, 13 had symptoms of a preceding viral-like infection, 18 had back-pain and 10 signs of spinal shock. The time from onset of ATM to maximum deficit varied from less than 1 h to 20 days. The thoracic region was the most common level of cord damage. Follow-up was possible in 29 cases; 2 died (2 and 8 months after onset), of the surviving 27 (follow-up 1-13 years, median 6 years) one third had a good outcome, one third a fair, while one third remained paraplegic, incontinent with severe sensory deficits. Back-pain and signs of spinal shock indicated a poor outcome."
CD008686,0,2343331,0,Spinal cord compression due to metastatic neoplasm.,"A retrospective study of 73 assessable patients with spinal cord compression due to metastatic tumor was conducted. Fifty-five patients had paraparesis and 18 were paraplegic. Treatment consisted of surgical decompression in 22 patients, radiotherapy in 31 patients, and a combination of both modalities in 20 patients. The three groups were comparable in their pretreatment characteristics. Of patients treated with surgical decompression followed by radiotherapy, 45% showed improvement in motor deficit; of patients treated with either surgery or radiotherapy, 18% (P = .06) and 16% (P = .02) showed improvement, respectively. These results were most significant in patients with paraparesis, where 47% of those who received combined therapy improved compared to 17% (P = .06) and 9% (P = .009) in the surgical and radiotherapy groups, respectively. In our series of patients with spinal cord compression due to metastatic tumor, surgical decompression followed by radiotherapy was superior to either surgical decompression or radiotherapy in improving motor deficit."
CD008686,0,2329617,0,Bladder function in patients with lipomyelomeningocele.,"We evaluated preoperative and postoperative bladder function in 31 consecutive patients who underwent definitive operative correction of lipomyelomeningocele. Of 12 patients less than 1.5 years old at operation, bladder function was normal preoperatively and postoperatively in 5 (42%) and normalized postoperatively in 4 (33%). In 5 patients (42%) abnormal urodynamic findings were the only sign of neurological abnormality. Of the 19 patients older than 1.5 years at operation bladder function was normal preoperatively and postoperatively in only 4 (21%), and normalized postoperatively in none. We conclude that the majority of patients with lipomyelomeningocele have bladder dysfunction, and that in some cases this dysfunction can be prevented and/or reversed by early neurosurgical intervention. Urodynamic assessment is helpful as part of the neurological evaluation and in directing patient care."
CD008686,0,2327553,0,Adrenal cortical adenoma in the spinal canal of an 8-year-old girl.,"An ectopic adrenal cortical adenoma containing high levels of androstenedione but without clinically detectable virilizing effects was found in the spinal intradural space of an 8-year-old girl. The tumor, which was located at the L2 level, manifested itself clinically by a short history of bilateral leg pain. It was well encapsulated; therefore, total surgical removal was accomplished. The light microscopic appearance of the tumor was typical of adenomatous adrenal cortical tissue. Ultrastructurally, it also showed characteristic features of steroid-producing tumors, including very abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum and giant mitochondria with tubulovesicular and circular cristae. Frozen tissue analyzed by radioimmunoassay was found to contain almost 20 times the normal tissue level of androstenedione. There was no elevation of cortisol or aldosterone levels in the tumor. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the retroperitoneum showed no abnormalities in the patient's adrenal glands. Serum androstenedione levels were normal. We postulate that the adenoma developed from congenital ectopic rests of intraspinal adrenal tissue. Although ectopic occurrence of adrenal cortical tissue has been recorded in other areas, neither such rests nor tumors developing from them have been previously reported within the spinal canal."
CD008686,0,2291510,0,[Bilateral retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy in tumors of the testis: anatomo-clinical considerations].,"Bilateral retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy is usually indicated for non-seminomatous testis tumour at stage IIA and IIB. For seminoma is generally used radiotherapy, although some Authors prefer the surgical approach. Radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy must be bilateral, because metastatic cell can often spread to the contralateral lymph nodes. Lymphadenectomy is used not only for therapy, but also for staging: thus clinical evaluation and other diagnostic techniques are not always correct (30% of understaging). Permanent sexual disfunction can follow radical surgery, due to extensive retroperitoneal dissection and exeresis of lumbar sympathetic nerves; so it is proposed, for stage I tumors, a monolateral or limited retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. Eight patients with non-seminomatous testicular tumours are reported by the authors; 2 (stage I) were treated with monolateral, 4 (stage IIA and IIB) with bilateral retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy; in 2 patients (stage IIC and IID) chemotherapy was followed by debulking surgery. Relapses were observed between 3 and 19 months. Sexual dysfunctions after surgery were present in 5 patients (69%); in all of these a bilateral retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy was performed."
CD008686,0,2241667,0,Malignant psoas syndrome: recognition of an oncologic entity.,"From January 1985 to January 1989 four patients with advanced cancer developed a syndrome characterized by proximal lumbosacral plexopathy and painful flexion of the ipsilateral hip with positive psoas muscle stretch test. Malignant involvement of the psoas major muscle was confirmed radiologically in all cases. Pain was intractable in 3 patients until time of death. We have termed this presentation the malignant psoas syndrome (MPS) and retrospective review of 427 oncology patients with ""high risk"" solid cancer culled no additional cases during the same 4-year period. We believe MPS to be a hitherto unreported complication of systemic cancer in which malignant involvement of the psoas muscle, in addition to producing severe nociceptive pain, contributes to the process of lumbosacral deafferentation. The clinical presentation, diagnosis and strategies of management of MPS are discussed."
CD008686,0,2199405,0,Unusual presentations of aortoiliac aneurysms.,"Unusual presentations of aortoiliac aneurysms may be the reason for a delay in diagnosis of potentially life-threatening conditions. Five such unusual clinical pictures are presented and discussed. The aneurysms were falsely diagnosed as malignant disease, renal colic, sciatic syndrome, intra-abdominal bleeding of unknown origin, and psoas muscle abscess. The medical staff was misled by the atypical complaints, signs and symptoms, which resulted in a dangerous delay in diagnosis. The use of currently available ultrasonography and CAT scans, which enables early diagnosis, depends on the alertness of clinicians when they confront an atypical clinical picture that may be the first clue of a noninnocent aneurysm of the aortoiliac complex. Early surgical intervention before dissection, rupture or fistulization occur ensures a positive outcome and avoids emergency procedures with their attendant high operative mortality and postoperative morbidity."
CD008686,0,2169787,0,[An autopsied case of alcoholic cerebellar degeneration with spastic paraplegia and neuropathy].,"A 45 year-old-female was admitted to Kanagawa Rehabilitation Center because of marked spastic paraplegia. There was no family history of neurological diseases. She had been drinking a great excess of alcohol since twenty years of age. Though she noticed the unsteadiness of gait several years prior to the admission, she had not been examined. On admission neurological examination revealed pyramidal weakness of both legs, and slight sensory impairment in distal part of the lower extremities. But she had neither difficulty in speech nor abnormal findings in the upper extremities. Her mentality was well preserved. Though computed tomography revealed cerebellar cortical atrophy, no signs of cerebellar impairment could not be found except spastic paraplegia. Blood chemistry failed to reveal liver dysfunction. There was no pernicious anemia. These symptoms were almost stationary until her death. At the age of 53, she died of gastric cancer. Postmortem examination disclosed marked degeneration of cerebellum and spinal cord. Cerebellar cortical degeneration, which was characterized by involvement of all layers of the cortex, showed unique distribution. The lingula, central lobule, culmen, superior portion of declive, anterior lobules and anteromedial half of simple lobule were severely degenerated, while other lobules were spared excluding moderate degeneration in inferomedian portion of the hemisphere. These cortical degeneration was prominent much more in vermis than in hemisphere. There was a mild myelin pallor in the lamellar white matter and slight fibrous gliosis. In the dentate nucleus, there were moderate neuronal loss with gliosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008686,0,2117259,0,[Two different spinal tumors (meningioma and schwannoma) with von Recklinghausen's disease in a case].,"Von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis is a congenital anomaly due to maldevelopment of the neurectoderm and mesoderm. The disease is known to be commonly associated with other tumors of the neural system. We experienced a case in which two different types of spinal tumors (meningioma and schwannoma) appeared together with Von Recklinghausen's disease. The patient was a 54 year-old female. Her chief complaint was slowly progressive lumbar back pain of about a 10-year duration. She was admitted to our hospital after developing such clinical symptoms as paraparesis, bladder and rectal incontinence, and pain in the soles of her feet. The CT study demonstrated a massive tumor at the TH12-L2 levels accompanied with marked scalloping of the posterior vertebral body. The tumor removed was, histologically, meningioma. During surgery, another small bean-size tumor was incidentally found originating from the dorsal root, and it was identified by histological study as typical schwannoma. It has been reported that the incidence rate of spinal tumors in von Recklinghausen's disease is approximately 4%. Although a case has been reported in which different types of tumors developed in both the cranium and the spinal canal, our case as described above is considered extremely rare as far as we can find in reference literature. The pathogenic mechanism of vertebral scalloping as encountered in our case was thought to be based on interactions between hypoplasia of the supporting tissue and pressure generated by the tumor and CSF."
CD008686,0,2387110,0,[A case of spinal dural arteriovenous malformation associated with the broad lesion within spinal cord--diagnostic value of MRI with Gd-DTPA enhancement].,"A 70-year-old man, with slowly progressive gait disturbance, numbness in his lower limbs and dysuria, was admitted to our hospital in July, 1988. Neurological examination revealed flaccid paraparesis, hyperesthesia below the level of Th-10 combined with the disturbance of pain and temperature sensations below the level of Th-11, and neurogenic bladder. Midsagittal Tl-weighed image of MRI did not reveal any abnormal finding except for a mild enlargement of the conus medullaris. With Gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA injection, however, the spinal cord was diffusely enhanced below the level of the 9th thoracic spine. This enhancement effect was particularly remarkable at the periphery of the spinal image showing several high intensity spots in the posterior aspect of the spinal cord, which was thought to be incompatible with the spinal cord neoplasm. The angiographic examination of the selective Th-7 intercostal artery on the left showed vascular malformation lying adjacent to the 7th intervertebral foramen with markedly dilated tortuous spinal veins going upwards and downwards, which was compatible with spinal dural arteriovenous malformation (AVM). After the artificial embolization, draining veins as well the nidus of AVM had completely disappeared on angiogram. There was an improvement on his neurological findings and Gd-DTPA enhancement had been diminished on MRI. It was suggested that Gd-DTPA enhancement on MRI was due to the dilated and remarkably congestive spinal veins, and that both the elevated venous pressure and reduction of intramedullary arteriovenous pressure gradient were the cause of the development of clinical symptoms."

CD008686,0,2364633,0,[A case of the primary mediastinal seminoma invading into the extradural space of the thoracic spine].,"Seminomatous germ cell tumors can arise as primary mediastinal malignancies in the mediastinum without involving the testis. The usual location is the superior mediastinum and histologically it is identical to the testicular seminoma. Here we report a case of extradural spinal cord tumor by primary mediastinal seminoma. The patient, 24 year old male, was evaluated for complaints of severe back pain associated with dysesthesia in lower limbs. He was operated as primary mediastinal seminoma when he was 21 years old. On admission, physical examination was unremarkable except for hypereflexia in lower extremities. The testis were normal. Chest radiography and computed tomography revealed a large mediastinal mass which invaded into the extradural space of the thoracic spine. He had a laminectomy of the thoracic spine and was treated by the radiation therapy and chemotherapy. This is the first report showing the neuroradiological findings of the extradural spinal cord tumor by primary mediastinal seminoma."

CD008686,0,2192866,0,Paget's disease of bone.,"Paget's disease of bone is defined as a process of increased bone remodeling; the primary event is increased resorption (osteoclastic activity) followed by subsequent reactive bone formation (osteoblastic activity). It is usually asymmetric and may be asymptomatic. The etiology is unknown, but recent evidence appears to support the theory that a virus is an important etiologic factor. It may present with a wide variation in the clinical and radiographic picture. The most frequent sites of involvement include the spine, femora, cranium, pelvis, and sternum. The most common complaints are pain, skeletal deformity, and change in skin temperature. Pathologic fractures may be the presenting manifestations or complications in a patient with known Paget's disease. They occur most frequently in the long weight-bearing bones of the lower extremities such as the femoral neck and subtrochanteric and tibial regions. The two major therapeutic agents available for treatment are calcitonins (porcine, salmon, or human) and diphosphonates. The aim of such therapy is to control the metabolic activity of the disease, to normalize the biochemical parameters, and to improve the symptoms. Fortunately, tumors are rare; early diagnosis may give rise to more effective palliation, if not a significant cure rate."
CD008686,0,2192191,0,[Symptoms and diagnosis of tumors of the central nervous system in children].,"Prognosis of brain tumors in children is altogether bad. For this reason it is necessary to diagnose brain tumors earlier as yet to improve the outcome. Symptoms of intracranial space occupying lesions are at first ambiguous: vomiting and headache, frequently associated with changes of behavior. Complaints of patients with brain tumors are multiple and progressive, in contradiction to patients suffering from spinal tumors showing only vague symptoms for a long time. Modern neuroimaging techniques such as sonography, computed tomography (CT) and nuclear magnetic resonance tomography (NMR) should be used early in patients with suspected symptoms."
CD008686,0,2143065,0,[Lumbosacral neoplastic radiculopathy].,"Lumbar-disc protrusions (LDP) constitute well-defined syndromes on clinical and anatomical grounds, and neurosurgeons are prone to rely upon the clinical signs to identify the level of disc protrusion when a ""typical"" case is found. Sometimes, non-contrasted computerized tomographic (CT) scans centered on the L5-S1, L4-L5 and L3-L4 interspaces and spine roentgenograms are the only special ancillary means in presurgical evaluation. We report three patients from our series, in which neoplastic spinal disease presented as classic LDP (one patient with a cauda equina schwannoma, and two with metastatic carcinoma). The cases were chosen because they posed special problems to the referred radiodiagnostic routine. Systematic CT-evaluation of the sacrum and conus medullaris zone is recommended in every patient with lumbosacral radiculopathy, and intrathecal contrast should be employed in patients with unreliable findings or normal CT-scans."
CD008686,0,2140124,0,The use of imaging procedures in the diagnosis of metastatic disease of the lumbar spine.,"Metastatic disease of the lumbar spine is a relatively common, but catastrophic cause of low back pain. Because of an increasing role as primary care providers for back pain patients, it is essential that chiropractors keep this possibility in mind. Careful consideration of the patient's history, physical and laboratory findings, and the use of imaging procedures are helpful in establishing a correct diagnosis in those cases where metastasis is suspected."
CD008686,0,2350933,0,[Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage due to spinal ependymoma presenting findings mimicking subacute meningitis].,"A case of spinal ependymoma showing spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage with findings mimicking subacute meningitis is reported. A 33-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of headache, low back pain and low grade fever on June 8, 1982. Ten years ago he had experienced an episode of abrupt onset lumbago and headache. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was suspected because of bloody cerebrospinal fluid, but cerebral angiography failed to demonstrate any abnormalities. On admission physical examination revealed nuchal rigidity, Kernig's sign and percussion tenderness on 5th lumbar spine. Lumbar puncture showed bloody cerebrospinal fluid. Cell counts were 217 per cubic millimeter (neutrophil: lymphocyte = 27.73), protein was 396 mg/dl and sugar level was 18 mg/dl. Myelography showed an intradural extramedullary tumor at the spinal level of L1-L2. Spinal MRI and CT scan also demonstrated a spinal tumor at the same level. Laminectomy and total resection of the spinal tumor were performed and a diagnosis of myxopapillary ependymoma was made histologically. He was discharged about a month later without any neurological deficits. The development of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to spinal tumor is rare. There are about 50 cases of spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage due to spinal tumor in the literature, including three cases in Japan. Two cases presenting CSF findings mimicking bacterial meningitis have been reported in the literature, but there is no report of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to spinal tumor that presents findings mimicking subacute meningitis similar to our case. From these results, it is suggested that subarachnoid hemorrhage due to spinal ependymoma may reveal various CSF findings. In cases suggesting bacterial or subacute meningitis with bloody CSF and acute onset, the possibility of spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a spinal tumor, especially ependymoma, should be considered."
CD008686,0,2324557,0,Epidural versus intrathecal morphine-bupivacaine: assessment of consecutive treatments in advanced cancer pain.,"Twenty-five patients with multifocal and multitype (somatic, visceral, and neurogenic) advanced cancer pain who experienced severe pain despite extradural (ED) morphine and bupivacaine were converted to intrathecal (IT) morphine and bupivacaine. The consecutive ED and IT periods (2-174 days, median = 50 days, and 1-305 days, median = 37 days, respectively) were assessed in clinical terms (daily analgesic dosages giving acceptable pain relief and quality of life expressed as sleeping hours and walking/daily activities). With the IT treatment, the total (all routes) opiate consumption and the daily doses of spinal morphine and spinal bupivacaine decreased significantly at the beginning of the treatment compared to the ED period, and continued to be significantly reduced for up to 1 wk for spinal opiate and bupivacaine and 6 mo for total opiate. The spinal opiate and bupivacaine doses were still lower in 50% of the patients at the end of the IT treatment compared to the end of the ED period. When final ED versus initial (2nd day) IT doses were assessed, the daily median dose ratios were 7.5 for total opiate and 4 for both spinal opiate and bupivacaine. Subsequently, lower daily volumes and higher concentrations were needed for IT administration of the drugs. During the first month of the IT treatment, sleeping and walking scores improved compared to ED treatment. Thus, the IT treatment gave more satisfactory pain relief, and--because of lower daily doses and volume--proved to be more suitable for treatment at home (continuous infusion from external pumps) than the ED treatment."

CD008686,0,2300727,0,[Atypical sciatica].,"A 46-year old patient had suffered from progressive nocturnal sciatica and motor weakness of the left lower extremity for three years. The physical examination revealed a discrete neurologic deficit of the left L5 and S1 root. By CT a small presacral mass between the L5 and S1 roots was found. During the CT-guided fine needle puncture the patient felt an electrifying pain radiating into the left lower extremity. The cytomorphological examination showed benign mesenchymal cells, indicative of a neurinoma. Since progredient neurological deficit is to be expected, exstirpation of the compressing tumor is the therapy of choice. Our patient however decided to postpone the operation because of only mild symptoms."
CD008686,0,2406555,0,Malignant mesothelioma with bone metastases.,"Malignant mesothelioma has rarely been reported to metastasize to bone. This is a report of a 71-year-old man who presented with pleural mesothelioma. After a course of chemotherapy, the patient developed lower back pain. Plain X-ray and bone scan were negative for metastases, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple metastatic lesions to the thoracolumbar vertebrae. Subsequent lumbar spine biopsy confirmed the presence of malignant mesothelioma. The patient then received radiation therapy. This report illustrates an unusual presentation for malignant mesothelioma and shows that, in addition, when bone metastases are clinically suspected, MRI may be a useful adjunct to more conventional imaging approach."
CD008686,0,2404234,0,Paget's disease of bone.,"Paget's disease of bone is defined as a process of increased bone remodeling; the primary event is increased resorption (osteoclastic activity) followed by subsequent reactive bone formation (osteoblastic activity). It is usually asymmetric and may be asymptomatic. The etiology is unknown, but recent evidence appears to support the theory that a virus is an important etiologic factor. It may present with a wide variation in the clinical and radiographic picture. The most frequent sites of involvement include the spine, femora, cranium, pelvis, and sternum. The most common complaints are pain, skeletal deformity, and change in skin temperature. Pathologic fractures may be the presenting manifestations or complications in a patient with known Paget's disease. They occur most frequently in the long weight-bearing bones of the lower extremities such as the femoral neck and subtrochanteric and tibial regions. The two major therapeutic agents available for treatment are calcitonins (porcine, salmon, or human) and diphosphonates. The aim of such therapy is to control the metabolic activity of the disease, to normalize the biochemical parameters, and to improve the symptoms. Fortunately, tumors are rare; early diagnosis may give rise to more effective palliation, if not a significant cure rate."
CD008686,0,2399840,0,Utility of surgery in the treatment of epidural vertebral metastases.,"Treatment of vertebral epidural metastases has been in the past and still remains the object of special attention in an attempt to improve the quality of life of these patients. To assess the effects of and indications for surgery, the clinical histories of 53 patients with this malignant disease who had undergone decompressive laminectomy have been reviewed retrospectively. The importance of the presence of complete or partial spinal cord compression in correlation with the presence of complete or partial myelographic block is dealt with. The results concerning pain, gait disturbances and sphincter disorders are studied with respect to the clinical and myelographic picture for the purpose of establishing the indications for decompressive laminectomy. Pain is not an indication for operative decompression, and complete paraplegia always never improves, thus being a contraindication. But in incomplete spinal cord involvement a decompression operation may be followed by an improvement of neurological deficit and quality of life."
CD008686,0,2268953,0,[Post-traumatic spinal arachnoid cyst].,"A 15 year old boy presents two fractures of the left inferior member (femur and tibia), after a motor-cycle accident. An osteosynthesis by plate and screws was performed, in emergency. In immediate post-operative days, a radicular paresia of the left inferior member appear especially on exterior popliteus sciatic nerve. The electromyogram confirm the diagnosis. However, these is nor pain nor fracture of the sacro-lumbar spine. The consolidation of femur and tibia fractures is normal. The neurologic recuperation is slow but progressive. A year after the accident, because the recuperation is not complete, an MRI is performed. An arachnoidal cyst surrounding the L5 and S1 roots is diagnosed. The surgery is decided. The ablation of the cyst is performed in the same operative time that the ablation of plate. The histology of the paries of the cyst confirm, by hemosiderimic deposits, the traumatic etiology. The arachnoïdal cyst is rare, particularly in the childhood. It is always difficult to know the relation between the cyst and the symptom. It is also impossible to be certain of traumatic etiology: traumatic cyst or traumatised cyst? The surgical indication is lawful by the existence of clinical signs, because 50 per cent of cases are improved or recovered."
CD008686,0,2255946,0,Magnetic resonance appearance of sacral insufficiency fractures.,"Insufficiency fractures of the sacrum are a commonly recognized form of stress fracture typically occurring in elderly patients. As such patients usually present with low back pain, MR imaging is often performed initially as a means of evaluation. We present 5 patients with sacral insufficiency fractures imaged with MR. Metastatic disease was a leading clinical suspicion as all patients were elderly and three had known primary neoplasms. T1-weighted sequences demonstrated bands of decreased signal intensity, usually paralleling the sacral aspect of the sacroiliac joints and occasionally occurring as a horizontal band across the sacral body. Four of five patients underwent further evaluation with computed tomography (CT) or nuclear bone scanning, which confirmed the diagnosis of sacral insufficiency fracture. We conclude that MRI is sensitive but not specific in detecting sacral insufficiency fractures. As MR imaging is rapidly becoming the method of choice for evaluating back pain, it is important to consider this diagnosis in elderly persons."
CD008686,0,2222879,0,Pain and spinal cysts in paraplegia: treatment by drainage and DREZ operation.,"About 10% of paraplegics suffer from intractable pain. The onset of pain may be immediate or delayed for months to several years after the injury. The delayed onset of pain is highly suggestive of the development of a spinal cyst. This is a report of 18 paraplegics who developed a delayed onset of intractable pain who were found at the time of surgery to have associated spinal cord cysts. Treatment consisted of the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) operation in addition to evacuation of the cyst. Burning pain was the most common complaint occurring years after the trauma. In this study we compared the relationship between the onset and character of the pain, the time of the spinal injury, the operative findings, and the results of the DREZ procedure and evacuation of the traumatic spinal cyst. We believe that the combination of paraplegia, pain and spinal cyst has not been emphasized in the neurosurgical literature although it is well known that cystic formation can follow spinal trauma. Two patients developed spinal cysts with nontraumatic lesions of the spinal cord. A single cyst was found in 14 patients while four had two separate cysts. The diagnosis was made on the basis of history and clinical examination with radiographic confirmation using delayed CT scan and myelography and more recently magnetic resonance imaging. Intraoperative ultrasound was employed in the study of some patients. All patients were treated with combined DREZ lesions and evacuation of the cysts with good pain relief in 77.7%."
CD008686,0,2175265,0,Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol shows antispastic and analgesic effects in a single case double-blind trial.,"A double-blind study was performed comparing 5 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) p.o., 50 mg codeine p.o., and placebo in a patient with spasticity and pain due to spinal cord injury. The three conditions were applied 18 times each in a randomized and balanced order. Delta-9-THC and codeine both had an analgesic effect in comparison with placebo. Only delta-9-THC showed a significant beneficial effect on spasticity. In the dosage of THC used no altered consciousness occurred."
CD008686,0,2168163,0,[Post-radiation brachial plexus disease. Clinical and neurophysiological study].,"Nine patients who developed 11 brachial plexopathies after a radiation therapy for cancer have been studied. They clinically showed heterogeneity in the common criteria used to establish the differential diagnosis between post-radiation and tumoral brachial plexopathies (PRBP and TBP) and specially within the period free of symptoms from the end of radiation, and the presence and intensity of pain. Neurophysiological studies showed a diffused neurogenic lesion with muscular denervation associated to motor and sensory nerve conduction impairment on proximal segments of the arm. Somatosensory evoked potentials were frequently abnormal with absence of N9 potential in 6 out of 7 explored plexuses. The most characteristic findings were, however, the presence of fasciculation potentials and myokymic discharges in 73 per cent of cases, and the motor nerve conduction blocking with proximal -supraclavicular and cervical spine- stimulation in all of them. Both of these phenomena, when analyzed in the same neuromuscular territory, were highly correlated, supporting a probable causal relationship. The neurophysiological data may contribute to the proper differentiation between brachial plexopathies of radiation or tumoral origin. The also would permit to consider a similar physiopathological basis of PRBP with some other infrequent neuropathies where they have been described as relevant features."
CD008686,0,2164165,0,[Ependymoma of the intradural filum terminale in adults. 20 cases].,"Twenty cases of ependymomas of the intradural filum terminale in adults have been reviewed. Their pathology was quite uniform, of a myxopapillary type, similar to the low grade ependymoma described by Kernohan, which represent about 23% of the tumours of cauda equina. Mean age of the patients was 35.7 years. Mean time between the first symptom and the diagnosis was 46 months. Clinical symptoms were often non specific, with low back pain and radiculalgias. At the time of operation, clinical signs were essentially motor deficits usually moderate (11 cases), sphincter disturbances (10 cases), and sensory loss (9 cases). In 3 patients with rapid worsening, an intratumoral haemorrhage was found. In 2 other cases, intracranial hypertension was the main symptom: in the first, it was related to hydrocephalus probably caused by spinal subarachnoid haemorrhage; in the second, there was no ventricular dilatation. In this series, neuroradiological examinations had consisted mainly in myelographies. C.T. scan has been performed in 3 patients; in only one case it has allowed to visualize a presacral extension. One patient had preoperative M.R.I.: the association of an expansive lesion with upper cyst in conus medullaris and presence of blood in the sacral area permitted the diagnosis of ependymoma of the filum terminalis. The average size of the tumours was 8 cm. Total removal has been possible in 15 cases (and in 2 of the 5 giant tumours), subtotal removal in 2 cases, and partial removal in 3 cases. In 4 patients where existed an intraspinal cord extension above the conus, it has been resected completely, except for one case with recurrence. Patients with a total removal had a good functional recovery (13/15). No recurrence has been observed in this group. In conclusion, with M.R.I., one may hope an earlier diagnosis, condition of radical surgery. So, radiotherapy which is not without risk, could be avoided."

Report of two cases.,"Osteoblastoma of the spine is a rare but important cause of back pain and the sciatica syndrome in young adults. Osteoblastoma of the skull is rare and the involvement of the orbital roof is very unusual. Clinical complaints and physical examination are not specific enough to provide a lead to the diagnosis. Bone scans and computerized tomography scans should be performed in all cases, to show the extent of vertebrae or calvarium infiltration by the tumor. To prevent recurrence and malignant transformation, the tumor should be completely removed whenever possible. If tumor excision is incomplete, a continuous follow-up is necessary to detect any recurrence or malignant transformation, which normally appears 5-10 years after the first operation (in one of our cases 7 years later)."
CD008686,0,2096606,0,"Metastatic spinal cord compression. Occurrence, symptoms, clinical presentations and prognosis in 398 patients with spinal cord compression.","We reviewed all medical records concerning patients suffering from spinal cord or cauda equina compression (SCC) secondary to cancer, in the eastern part of Denmark, from 1979 through 1985. During the period the incidence of SCC in cancer patients went up from 4.4% to 6%. However, this increase was not significant. The series comprised 398 cases, with carcinoma of the prostate (19%), lung (18%), breast (14%) and kidney (10%) accounting for 61%. The symptoms were evaluated in accordance with the patients rating of pain, motor deficits, sphincter control and paraesthesia, whereas the clinical manifestations were classified on the basis of motor deficit and bladder dysfunction. During the period preceding the diagnosis of SCC, 83% of the patients suffered from back pain, 67% from deteriorating gait and 48% had retention of the urine. In 35% of the patients there was no sphincter disturbance and 10% had normal sensory function. The outcome of treatment was estimated by changes in motor deficits and sphincter function, and depended primarily on the patients condition at the time of the diagnosis. Of the patients who were able to walk before treatment, 79% remained ambulatory, whereas only 18% of the non-ambulatory patients regained walking ability. Patients treated by decompressive laminectomy followed by radiotherapy apparently had a better response than patients treated with surgery or irradiation alone, but when the patients pre-treatment motor function was taken into account, no significant difference was observed. The study may call for a properly randomized trial with careful stratification of tumour biology, performance status and neurological deficits."

CD008686,0,2804911,0,Identification of epidural neoplasm. Radiography and bone scintigraphy in the symptomatic and asymptomatic spine.,"Early identification and treatment of epidural neoplasm, before the development of significant neurologic deficits, provides the best opportunity for a favorable outcome. Among the many patients with symptoms, signs, or scintigraphic or radiographic findings suggesting possible epidural disease, a small proportion will have the lesion. The selection of patients for definitive imaging of the epidural space should be based on a determination of the risk of this complication. In this study, the medical records, plain spinal radiographs, bone scintigraphs and myelograms of 43 patients were analyzed retrospectively to assess the risk of epidural disease associated with specific clinical, radiographic, and scintigraphic findings. Cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral spinal segments were evaluated independently. Symptomatic segments (SS) (N = 41), defined by focal pain or neurologic dysfunction, were distinguished from asymptomatic segments (AS). At SS, epidural disease was found at 86% and 8% of abnormal and normal spinal radiographs, respectively (P less than 0.001), and at 69% and 0% of abnormal and normal scintigrams, respectively (P less than 0.001), whereas at AS epidural disease occurred in 43% and 3% of abnormal and normal spinal radiographs, respectively (P less than 0.001), and 14% and 7% of abnormal and normal scintigrams, respectively (P = NS). Vertebral collapse was highly predictive of an epidural lesion. Epidural disease occurred in 12% of SS and 0% of AS with an abnormal scintigram and normal radiograph, 86% of SS and 45% of AS with abnormalities on both scintigram and radiograph, and at two AS when both were normal. Decision analysis applied to these data yielded a specific conditional probability of epidural disease for each combination of clinical, scintigraphic, and radiographic findings. These data provide a basis for the selection of patients for additional evaluation of the epidural space before neurologic deficits develop."
CD008686,0,2696287,0,Tethered cord syndrome: clinical signs and results of operation in 42 patients with spina bifida aperta and occulta.,"The results of tethered spinal cord operations in 42 patients were evaluated. Over a period of 10 years, 20 spina bifida occulta (S.B.O.) and 22 spina bifida aperta (S.B.A.) patients were operated. In the S.B.O. group 6 patients were operated when young in order to prevent neurological deterioration. With a mean follow-up of 3 years they developed no new neurological symptoms. The clinical symptoms and the age at which the neurological deterioration occurred was quite similar in the S.B.O. and S.B.A. patients. Motor dysfunction and pain in back and/or legs were the most frequent symptoms. The postoperative complication rate was low. The purpose of surgery was to stop further neurological deterioration. The operative results were slightly better in the S.B.A. group than with the S.B.O. group. In both groups of patients it was evident that operation at an older age after a long period of complaints was associated with less favourable postoperative results. The surgical treatment of a tethered spinal cord syndrome in patients with spina bifida aperta is no more risk than an operation in spina bifida occulta patients."
CD008686,0,2616177,0,Comparison of subjective and objective analgesic effects of intravenous and intrathecal morphine in chronic pain patients by heat beam dolorimetry.,"The pain tolerance latencies of 10 chronic pain patients were evaluated by heat beam dolorimetry (stimulus intensity 15.33 mW.cm-2.sec-1) prior to and following administration of morphine by intrathecal (n = 5) or intravenous (n = 5) routes. Patients not undergoing opiate withdrawal evinced increased baseline pain tolerance latencies prior to drug administration compared with normal volunteers. Two patients undergoing the opiate withdrawal syndrome at the time of test experienced reduced pain tolerance latencies compared with normal volunteers, most probably corresponding to the hyperesthesia symptom of the syndrome. Intravenous morphine infusion (30 mg) induced a time-dependent increase in cutaneous pain tolerance with peak effect occurring 1-2 h after administration. This persisted for up to 4 h and thereafter declined. The time course of subjective pain self-report by visual pain analog scale (VPAS) measurements corresponded to the time course of increasing cutaneous pain tolerance latency assessed by dolorimetry. Pain self-reports following intrathecal morphine infusion (2.25 or 1 mg) followed a similar though slower onset to that reported by patients receiving intravenous morphine and was of lesser degree. In contrast, heat beam dolorimetric evidence of increased cutaneous pain tolerance (which was of lesser degree than following i.v. morphine) did not reach its maximum during the 4 h measuring period. A dissociation was noted therefore between the self-reported relief of endogenous pain and dolorimetrically measured cutaneous analgesia following intrathecal morphine administration. Linear regression correlation analysis characterized this phenomenon as a positive correlation between cutaneous pain tolerance and pain relief self-report following intravenous morphine infusion and a negative correlation following intrathecal administration. We propose that the phenomenon may be due to intrathecal morphine acting via two separate compartments: one spinal and one supraspinal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,2576108,0,Congenital lumbosacral lesions with late onset in adult life.,"Seven adult patients with congenital lumbosacral lesions and clinical onset in adult life are reported. All also had an abnormally low and tethered spinal cord. A thickened filum terminale and a spinal lipoma are the most common lesions in adults, whereas others, including diastematomyelia, fibrous adhesions, previous meningocele repair and dermal sinus are more rare. Although water-soluble myelography visualizes the abnormally low conus well and may diagnose a diastematomyelia and a thickened filum, computerized tomography, CT myelography and magnetic resonance may provide a better diagnostic definition of the other abnormalities. Surgical treatment should be performed in all adult patients with progressive symptoms. Transection of the thickened filum or of fibrous adhesions and the removal of a spinal lipoma, diastematomyelia septum or dermal sinus tract, result in remission of the pain and improvement of the sensorimotor deficits, or at least prevent the progression of the neurological troubles."

Fifty-seven patients with an average follow-up of 13 months (range 4-26) were evaluable. Diagnosis was always made by means of myelography and/or myelography plus CT. In 50 cases the treatment consisted in RT alone and the remaining 7 patients had surgery before RT because of diagnostic doubts; in 1 case the patient was operated on because stabilization was necessary. A dose of 30 Gy was delivered, over 2 weeks, (TDF = 62) to those tumors which were considered as radiation-responsive and having a better prognosis (myeloma, lymphoma), whereas all the other histologies were given a split-course regimen (5 Gy x 3 days, stop x 4 days, +/- 3 Gy x 5 days; TDF = 68). All patients received medium or high doses of steroid depending on the degree of neurologic involvement. Patients with chemo/hormone-responsive primary tumors also received chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy. The clinical parameters considered in evaluating the response to treatment were backache, motor performance, and sphincter function. Respectively 86%, 47% and 44% of patients responded. Early diagnosis was the most important prognostic factor, whereas histology of the primary tumor was important in cases with severe neurologic damage only. The results obtained are similar to those reported in literature and confirm the value of the diagnostic-therapeutic approach used, which suggests continuing this trial."

Possible causes are: short thickened filum terminale, fibrotic ligaments, intradural lipomas. The clinical course is characterised by motoric and sensory deficits, disturbances of balance, neurogenic bladder disturbances, foot deformities and backache. A 3-year-old boy after operation of a lipomyelomeningocele at 2 months showed a one-sided leg shortening and a progressive neurogenic bladder and intestinal disturbance. The cause was a low state of the conus with a shortened filum terminale and a remainder of a lipoma. A 7-year-old boy after operation of a thoraco-lumbar meningomyelocele developed a progressive asymmetric paraspastic state with contractures. The neuro-radiological diagnosis of an intradural dermoid was verified on operation. A 10-year-old boy after operation of a covered lumbosacral meningocele showed a progressive backache which was connected with flexion. We found a low state of the conus through adhesions caused by scars which could be removed operatively. A collaborative treatment by the paediatric surgeon and the neuro-paediatrician of patients with dysraphic disturbances can prevent the severe consequences of the tethered cord problems with the co-operation and early intervention of the neuropaediatric surgeon."
CD008686,0,2529624,0,[The differential diagnosis of lumbar disk prolapse].,"When examining a patient with a radicular syndrome the first step is to localize the neurologic damage. Clinical examination usually allows differentiation of radicular from plexus and peripheral nerve lesions and also from non-neurogenic symptoms. The second step is to look for etiology, which often needs additional investigations. Plain films of the spine with views in flexion and extension show disease of the bony structures and instability. Soft tissue alterations leading to radicular or dural compression are best shown by computed tomography, which is also the method of choice to prove space occupying lesions of the abdominal and pelvic cavity. Myelography shows best longitudinal extension of intraspinal processes. Magnetic resonance imaging is the method of choice to prove intramedullary lesions. Early diagnosis of spine infection needs scintigraphy. Radicular inflammation or irritation by tumor-cells (meningosis) will be missed with-out CSF-examination."
CD008686,0,2677596,0,Spinal cord infarction. Report of 8 cases and review of the literature.,"While the incidence of spinal cord ischemia is not known, it is generally considered to be rare. Diagnosis of presumed spinal cord ischemia requires the appropriate clinical picture and exclusion of other possible etiologies. Definitive diagnosis usually requires postmortem examination. During a 52-month period, 8 patients with presumed spinal cord infarction were evaluated at a 238-bed community hospital. These cases accounted for 1.2% of all admissions for stroke. Infarction of the spinal cord was confirmed on postmortem examination in 2 cases. All 6 surviving patients regained substantial motor function. Bowel and/or bladder dysfunction returned to normal in 3 patients. The literature is reviewed, and the cases are discussed in relation to the pertinent anatomic, pathogenic, and clinical aspects of spinal cord infarction."
CD008686,0,2816599,0,[Clinical study of prostatic cancer].,"Eighty patients with prostatic cancer, who first visited Kyorin University School of Medicine from January 1976 through December 1986, were analyzed. Incidence of prostatic cancer was 3.9% among male inpatients. Age distribution was between 55 and 88, with an average of 72 years old. The most common symptoms were dysuria followed by pollakisuria, hematuria, lumbago and lower extremity pain. Duration from onset of symptom to examination ranged from 6 to 84 months, with an average of 22 months. Clinical stage was A in 7.5%, B in 10%, C in 11.3% and D in 71.3%. According to histological grade, well, moderately, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas were observed in 29.9, 29.9 and 40.2%, respectively. According to the General Rules for Clinical and Pathological Studies on Prostatic Cancer, clinical T classification were T0 in 8.7%, T1 in 3.8%, T2 in 47.5%, T3 in 27.5% and T4 in 12.5%. In the correlation between stage and grade, the largest number of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cases was in stage D. There was no correlation between stage and T classification. Of the 80 patients, 71.25% were treated with antiandrogen therapy, 16.25% with radiation therapy chiefly, 7.5% by surgery chiefly, and 5% with chemotherapy. Survival rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Overall survival rate of the 80 patients was 54.4% at 5 years. Survival rate by stage were 100% in stage A at 4 years, and 100% in B, 87.5% in C and 40.5% in D at 5 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The ages of the patients ranged from 6 to 79 years (mean 49.3 years). No sex predominance was seen. Five cases of unilateral subscapular tumor and two cases of bilateral masses were identified. Four patients had pain with arm motion, and the remaining patients were free of symptoms. A nonencapsulated soft tissue mass elevating the scapula was identified by computed tomography. Incisional biopsy was performed in all cases, followed by local excision of the tumor. On gross examination, these lesions were firm and rubbery. Histologic evaluation demonstrated a slightly hypercellular fibrous tissue that contained variable numbers of fragmented elastic fibers. All patients with symptomatic tumors had complete relief of their pain after the operation. No recurrences were observed. Clinically, elastofibroma may mimic sarcoma and fibromatosis (extraabdominal desmoid tumors). Whether elastofibroma is a true neoplasm or a reactive fibrous lesion that produces not only collagen, but also abnormal elastic fibers, has been the subject of controversy and remains undetermined."

CD008686,0,2805516,0,[Two cases of post-poliomyelitis muscular atrophy].,"We report two males with progressive post-poliomyelitis muscular atrophy (PPMA) who developed slowly progressive weakness and atrophy in the previously unaffected muscles 50 years after acute poliomyelitis. Case 1 is a 61-year-old male who had suffered from poliomyelitis at the age of 3 years. After recovery from acute symptoms, paralysis remained in the right face, left upper extremity and right lower extremity. Paralysis had remained unchanged until the age of 55 years, when he felt increased fatigue and progressive muscle weakness of all extremities. Neurological examination revealed muscle atrophy of the left upper and right lower extremities, and muscle hypertrophy of the left lower extremity. Deep tendon reflexes were decreased or absent. Babinski sign was negative. Reduction of his physical level and administration of anticholinesterase agents improved his feeling of fatigue. Case 2 is a 66-year-old male who suffered from poliomyelitis in his infancy, and paralysis remained in the left hand and right lower extremity. At the age of 50 years, he felt fatigue, muscle weakness of the previously unaffected legs and joint pain. Neurological examination revealed proximal muscle atrophy and weakness of lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were decreased and Babinski sign was negative. Needle electromyography of both cases showed typical neurogenic pattern or high amplitude and polyphasic long duration MMUs. Muscle biopsy of them from quadriceps femoris showed variability in fiber size, moderate increase of internal nuclei, fiber splitting, type grouping, grouped atrophy and scattered small angulated fibers, indicating chronic denervation and reinnervation. The clinical features and laboratory findings of the present two cases are consistent with those of PPMA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008686,0,2755583,0,CSF TRAP: a procedure to improve laboratory testing with myelography.,"CSF TRAP (Transport and Rapid Accessioning for Additional Procedures) is a procedure that provides storage of and rapid access to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens and allows clinicians to review initial findings before ordering low-yield CSF studies. The cost-effectiveness of routinely using the CSF TRAP procedure with myelography is examined in a study group of 819 patients, 74% with disc diseases, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, or pain syndromes, 10% with cancer, and 16% with neuropathies and miscellaneous conditions. Routine studies on CSF obtained during myelography provided little additional clinical information, except for patients with cancer (of 80 patients with cancer, the results of cytological examination of the CSF were positive in 12) and patients with multiple sclerosis, for whom oligoclonal band and IgG analysis provided supportive diagnostic data. The utilization of the CSF TRAP procedure with elimination of unnecessary culture and cytological studies on patients with disc diseases, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and pain syndromes, reduces myelographic CSF procedures by 20%, for a savings exceeding $14,000. The CSF TRAP procedure allows for a more cost-efficient analysis of CSF obtained using myelography, while providing fluid for analysis in patients with unexpected findings."

We report 8 patients with known breast cancer who developed neurological symptoms attributable to an intracranial meningioma and 1 patient who developed spinal cord dysfunction resulting from a thoracic meningioma. The removal of the meningiomas resulted in return of normal neurological function in all patients. At follow-up, all our patients are alive without evidence of meningioma or breast carcinoma recurrence, except 1 patient who died of a metastatic malignant melanoma. This clinical association requires repeated emphasis because of the potential benefit in management of patients with suspected metastatic disease. We have reviewed and summarized the reported literature and added our 8 cases. The mean age of presentation before the second tumor was 6 years. Breast carcinoma was diagnosed first in 85% of cases. The clinical symptoms of the meningiomas were focal neurological signs in 50% of the patients, raised intracranial pressure in 40%, and a seizure in 10%."

The surgically excised lesion showed a cyst lined by ciliated columnar epithelium with copious mucin secretion similar to that seen in colloid cysts of the third ventricle and enterogenous cysts of the spinal canal. In addition the cyst contained brownish material with an exuberant xanthogranulomatous reaction and numerous cholesterol clefts.

CD008686,0,2526943,0,Physical findings in patients with chronic intractable benign pain of the neck and/or back.,"Chronic intractable benign pain (CIBP) is defined as non-neoplastic pain of greater than 6 months duration without objective physical findings and known nociceptive peripheral input. To test the CIBP concept, 283 consecutive chronic pain patients were examined independently by a neurosurgeon and physiatrist and only congruent physical findings were coded. Because they did not fit the CIBP definition, patients with the following primary treatment diagnoses were eliminated: degenerative disease of the spine and spinal stenosis; degenerative disease of the hips; radiculopathy; malignancy; deafferentation pain; and miscellaneous. Eliminated, also, were patients with any one finding indicative of a root compression syndrome, leaving 90 low back and 34 neck patients. These patients had abnormal physical findings in 7 categories: tender points/trigger points; decreased ranges of motion in back or neck; non-anatomical sensory loss; rigid musculature; decreased range of hip motion; gait disturbance; and miscellaneous non-neurologic signs. Low back CIBP patients had the following distribution among the 7 categories: 0% had findings of all 7; 1.1% had 6; 13.3% had 5; 24.4% had 4; 25.6% had 3; 26.7% had 2; 8.9% had 1; and 0% had none. Neck CIBP patients, in which only the first 4 categories of physical findings were applicable had the following distribution: 2.9% had 4; 41.2% had 3; 35.3% had 2; 20.6% had 1; and 0% had none. It was concluded that CIBP patients do have abnormal physical findings indicative of musculoskeletal disease: possibly fibrositis and/or specific myofascial syndromes, as sources of peripheral nociception. These findings question the validity of the CIBP concept and point to the need for a careful, all-inclusive physical examination as a basic initial requirement in the classification of chronic pain patients."
CD008686,0,2524249,0,Epidural metastases in prospectively evaluated veterans with cancer and back pain.,"Ninety-five male veterans with cancer and back pain were prospectively evaluated for epidural metastases. The evaluation included vertebral roentgenograms and a myelogram. The most common cancers were lung and prostate. Forty-three percent of the patients had an epidural metastasis, including 73% of the 37 patients with myelopathy and 48% of the 29 patients with radiculopathy. None of the 29 patients who had back pain without radiculopathy or myelopathy had an epidural metastasis. Thirty-seven patients were treated with only radiation therapy and dexamethasone and four also had surgical decompression. Nineteen of the 20 patients who could walk at diagnosis walked after completion of therapy, whereas, only 11 of the 21 patients who were not ambulatory at the time of diagnosis walked after completion of therapy. The probability of surviving 12 months was 73% for patients who could walk after treatment and 9% for nonambulatory patients. Emergency spinal canal imaging is warranted in cancer patients with back pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or myelopathy."

A 28-year-old man was hospitalized with the complaint of a palpable mass in the left lower abdomen and lumbago. Physical examination revealed a normal right scrotal testicle and a small right inguinal hernia that did not contain a mass, but no testicle was found in the left scrotum. Laparotomy was performed for suspected tumor of an intraabdominal testis. At abdominal exploration the left testis was found to be cross-ectopic to just behind the pubic symphysis and to be replaced completely with a large tumor, which was supplied by the left spermatic vessels and had a vas deferens emptied to the right seminal vesicle. In addition another cord-like structure was traced into the right inguinal canal. The tumor was dissected with these structures. On histological examination the tumor was pure seminoma and the cord-like structure proved to be an immature uterus, Fallopian tubes and seminal vesicle."

Physical examination was unremarkable. On neurological examination, deep tendon reflexes were decreased in all extremities without pathological reflexes. Vibration sense was decreased severely at the medial malleolus and moderately at the anterior superior iliac spine. Joint sensation of the toes was moderately decreased. Light touch, temperature discrimination, and pinprick sensation were slightly decreased on fingers bilaterally and distal to the middle part of both legs. Muscle strength was normal. His gait was unsteady and Romberg's sign was positive. Finger to nose test and heel to knee test were mildly disturbed bilaterally. The sural nerve action potential was not elicited on electrical stimulation. Laboratory studies for malignancy showed gastric cancer. Only July 4, he underwent subtotal gastrectomy. Histologically it showed adenosquamous carcinoma. Postoperatively gait disturbance and pain in both legs improved slightly. Peak latencies of P2 of SEP following right and left posterior tibial nerve stimulation were 47. 9 msec and 48.8 msec on February 14, and 44.5 msec and 43.9 msec on October 6, 1986, respectively, and their postoperative shortening was evident.

A 55-year-old female, who had a history of subtotal gastrectomy for signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach 7 years ago, was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of lumbago on October 25, 1987. Red blood cell count was 92 X 10(4)/microliters, hemoglobin 2.7 g/dl, hematocrit 8.0%, platelet 6.4 X 10(4)/microliters, and white blood cell count 13,400/microliters with leukoerythroblastosis. Bone marrow aspiration of the sternum, left iliac crest, and bilateral posterior superior iliac supine showed extensive bone marrow necrosis. Serum ALP was increased to 7410IU/l, dominated isozyme of bone type. Hemostatic findings suggested a complication of consumption coagulopathy. Skull, vertebrae, iliac and pelvic bone X-ray showed multiple osteolytic lesions, and irregular isotope uptake was recognized on the bone scintigraphy using 99mTc. Sixth bone marrow examination at the right iliac crest revealed signet ring cell carcinoma metastasis. In spite of detailed examinations, there was no evidence of primary carcinoma, including the remnant of stomach. We speculated that the signet ring cells were originated from the respected gastric cancer. The patient has received anti-cancer chemotherapy with UFT and OK432, and is still alive 9 months after diagnosis."

A 9-year experience.,"Between 1978 and 1986, 109 patients with chronic pain underwent spinal cord stimulation (SCS) at the authors' institute as part of their pain treatment program. The results of SCS in these patients at the end of the test period and at the latest follow-up examination are analyzed in relation to the etiology of their pain. In 40 patients pain was associated with an obstructive peripheral vasculopathy, in 10 with a previous herpes zoster infection, in 15 with an incomplete traumatic spinal cord lesion, in nine with root and/or nerve damage, in 11 with cancer, and in 19 with previous back surgery. The etiology of the pain in five patients was uncertain. This experience supports the conclusion that the best indications for SCS are vasculopathic pain and post-herpetic neuralgia. No clinical usefulness was found for SCS in cancer pain or in central deafferentation types of pain."

Laboratory examination on admission showed anemia, an IgA-kappa Bence Jones proteinemia. The bone marrow picture disclosed a marked involvement by the neoplastic cells, followed by leukemic conversion 2 weeks later. The leukemic cells displayed a lymphoblastoid appearance on light microscopy, but rather compatible with plasma cells on electron microscopy, showing some strands of rough endoplasmic reticulum and a prominent Golgi apparatus in the cytoplasm. The cells expressed a wide spectrum of surface markers, including those of plasma cell (PCA-1, OKT10), B cell (B1, sIg) and CALLA. Reverse hemolytic plaque assay disclosed the immunoglobulin production of monoclonal kappa chain, but a heavy chain production was recognized only in a small proportion of the cells. Under the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, he was treated with vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone. But he died of renal failure complicating hypercalcemia after only three months of the admission in accordance with previous reports that CALLA-positive myeloma was associated with poor prognosis. This case may also represent the clinical, morphological and phenotypic diversity in multiple myeloma."
CD008686,0,2478912,0,[Malignant lymphoma of the spinal epidural space. Report of three cases].,"Three patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the spinal epidural space are reported. All three patients, a 3-year-old boy (Case 1), a 63-year-old female (Case 2), and a 64-year-old male (Case 3), manifested signs and symptoms of neurological involvement before the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was established by tissue examination. The tumors were located in the thoracic (Case 3) and thoracolumbar regions (Cases 1 and 2). The initial signs and symptoms of all cases were low back pain and progressing myelopathies. Bony abnormalities of the vertebrae, seen on both plain X-rays and computed tomographic scans, were unremarkable except for bilateral L1 pedicle erosion observed in Case 2. Total or subtotal tumor removal was followed by radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy in all cases. The primary lesion in Case 1 was a paravertebral lymphoma that had invaded the adjacent thoracolumbar epidural space through the intervertebral foramina. In Case 2, the primary lesion, documented by post-mortem examination, was a submucosal lymphoma of the stomach. In Case 3, the site of primary lesion could not be determined, although splenic and retroperitoneal nodal involvement was found at autopsy. The authors take a skeptical view of the existence of ""primary"" spinal epidural lymphoma, which has been reported a few times. Each of the three patients reported here presented with an epidural mass as the initial clinical manifestation of malignant lymphoma."

The diagnosis can often be made from normal X-rays. Diagnostic problems are especially common in cases of rare, atypical localisations (spine, sacrum, clavicula, talus, calcaneus and the proximal part of the femur). The scintigraphy represents an unspecific but sensitive method of diagnosis in the early stages. The osteoid-osteoma is visible as a ""hot spot"" or, in the subperiosteal type, as a diffuse accumulation. Angiography is of great importance for preoperative localisation and differential diagnosis. Computer tomography is particularly valuable for localisation in the region of the spine. Magnetic resonance is an excellent method of examination. The three dimensional imaging allows an exact localisation, especially in atypical and difficult localisations. This will be the preferred method of the future, not least because there is no exposure to radiation."

The duration of the peripheral neuropathy varied from 2 to 11 months before the malignant tumors were confirmed. The initial peripheral neuropathy included cranial nerve, sciatic nerve, intercostal nerve, brachial plexus, multiple peripheral nerves, thoracic outlet syndrome, polyneuritis, peripheral neuritis, autonomic nerve and Horner's syndrome. Most of these malignant tumors were lung cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer and hepatic carcinoma in order of incidence. Pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of these tumors are discussed with review of the literature. The author emphasizes that if there was peripheral neuropathy of unknown cause, examination has to be done in detail and repeatedly for early diagnosis and better result."
CD008686,0,2522677,0,[Lumbar spinal stenosis syndrome in the experience of a rheumatologic-geriatric clinic].,"In the geriatric patient differential diagnosis of low back pain with sciatica includes degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, affecting the central canal, the lateral recesses or both. Symptoms usually begin in the sixth decade, but may occur earlier if spinal degeneration is superimposed on congenital stenosis. In the elderly early diagnosis is more difficult to establish, because of the bewildering medical problems and the multiple symptoms rooted in the polypathy and polymorbidity of old age. Typical symptoms include low back pain, claudicatory pains, and paraesthesias of the legs, typically aggravated by standing and relieved by rest. In our series they were present in 100%, 94% and 56% respectively. In our series, the most important clinical investigations confirming diagnosis were pain provocation by reclining and pain relief by inclination (present in 69% of patients) and combined radiographic examination including plain films, computed tomography and myelography. In our experience myelography proved the best single method for early diagnosis. In our elderly patients lateral stenosis was predominant, and therefore lateral decompression by foraminotomy, generally combined with flavectomy, was the most important surgical procedure. In cases with combined lateral and central stenosis, hemilaminectomy or facetectomy was also performed. In follow-up 1 to 5 years after the operation the success rate, determined by very restrictive criteria, was 87%. Therefore, and because failure to establish early diagnosis potentially leads to definitive invalidity, degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis should be considered more frequently in the differential diagnosis of low back pain of the elderly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,2919454,0,[Bone metastasis].,"Bone metastases are frequently one of the first signs of disseminated disease in cancer patients. In the majority of patients, the primary tumour originates from the breast, prostate or lungs. Even although the prognosis is serious, a proportion of the patients will survive for several years and will thus require active treatment. More than 25% of the patients have no symptoms whereas pain dominates in the remainder. Frequent complications are pathological fractures, hypercalcaemia and spinal cord compression. Normally, the diagnosis can be established from the clinical picture compared with a series of laboratory analyses, x-ray investigations of the skeleton and bone scintigraphy. As treatment is mainly palliative, the purpose is primarily relief of pain, prevention of fractures and ensuring a reasonable functional level. The therapeutic possibilities comprise local treatment in the form of surgery and irradiation and also systemic treatment in the form of chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and possibly diphosphonates. of these, irradiation still plays the most important role. About 80% of the patients respond to treatment and, after 12 months, 50-70% of the surviving patients will still be free from pain. Only few randomized investigations are found in the literature available and the criteria of response are, in general, difficult to interpret. There is, therefore, a great requirement for more clinically controlled investigations which assess the efficacy of the numerous therapeutic possibilities."
CD008686,0,2915794,0,Spinal cord pathology in pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,"We examined the spinal cords from 15 consecutive autopsies of infants and children with AIDS using a battery of histochemical and immunocytochemical stains, and in four cases, electron microscopy. Corticospinal tract (CST) signs were a notable clinical finding in 14; however, the age of onset, rate of progression, severity of dysfunction, and duration varied among patients. Ten cases had pathologic changes in the CST. In four of the ten cases, the changes were consistent with an ""axonopathy"" since axons and myelin were both diminished in the CST. These cases may represent CST wallerian degeneration, since they had marked injury to cerebral white matter in the form of chronic inflammation with multinucleated cells, gliosis, and myelin pallor. In five cases, with an average age at death of 31 months, the CST showed poor myelination with relative preservation of axons. These cases may represent delayed myelination or possibly cytokine-mediated injury to newly formed myelin since the CST is one of the last tracts to myelinate in the spinal cord. One child with primary CNS lymphoma had a complicated pattern of spinal injury due to unilateral CST wallerian degeneration possibly superimposed upon delayed myelination, in addition to patchy areas of demyelination associated with perivascular lymphomatous infiltrates. Four children with mild CST signs, ranging in age from 5 to 6 months, had CST myelin pallor that was consistent with the degree of myelination expected for age. We did not find vacuolar myelopathy similar to that seen in adult AIDS, but did note focal vacuolar changes in the thoracic posterior columns in the oldest child."

The following therapeutic protocol is proposed: 1) in TN patients at first operation: a) gasserian compression (or glycerolization, if experience warrants it) is indicated in all cases of typical TN, unless the 3rd division alone is affected; b) in the latter case and in symptomatic TN, we suggest thermocoagulation; 2) in recurrences: a) after glycerolization or gasserian compression, gasserian compression (or glycerolization) is indicated; b) after thermocoagulation or open surgery, thermocoagulation is suggested."
CD008686,0,2660499,0,[Two cases of ureteral endometriosis].,"We report two successfully treated cases of ureteral endometriosis. Case 1 is in a 47-year-old female who had a past history of simple hysterectomy and right oophorectomy. Pathological diagnosis was myoma uteri and pelvic endometriosis. Two months later, she visited our clinic for right flank pain. Excretory urogram and retrograde pyelogram revealed right hydroureteronephrosis and stricture of the right lower ureter. The diagnosis of ureteral endometriosis was made from the past history and clinical features. Danazol therapy started with a daily dose of 400 mg. Sixteen days later, excretory urogram demonstrated complete resolution of the right hydronephrosis. An intravenous pyelography about 1 year after the danazol therapy has indicated no recurrence. Case 2 is in a 35-year-old female who visited our clinic for right lumbar pain. Excretory urogram and retrograde pyelogram revealed right hydroureteronephrosis and stricture of the right lower ureter. Right ureterocystoneostomy was performed unsuccessfully resulting in endoscopic dilation. Right lower ureter was buried in the dense fibrous tissue approximately 5 cm below the crossing with iliac vessels. The area of obstruction was removed. Histologically, endometriosis was diagnosed. Twenty nine cases of ureteral endometriosis including our two cases were collected from the Japanese literatures and reviewed with respect to the clinical features and treatment."
CD008686,0,2646738,0,Current considerations in the management of neoplastic spinal cord compression.,"Nearly 20% of patients with neoplastic involvement of the vertebral column develop spinal cord compression, and in 8% this is the initial manifestation of cancer. Important determinants of functional prognosis are: 1) tumor biology, 2) pretreatment neurologic status, and 3) tumor location within the spinal canal and the therapy employed. Future efforts should be invested in manipulation of the last two determinants. Delay in neurologic deterioration may be achieved by pharmacologic manipulation of the deleterious pathophysiologic processes operating in the compressed spinal cord, as recently demonstrated in experimental animal models. Use of modern neuro-imaging techniques (metrizamide myelography combined with computed tomography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging) will accurately define tumor extent and location. Radiotherapy is indicated in highly or moderately radiosensitive tumors. Surgery is reserved for the following situations: diagnosis in doubt, previous radiation exposure, radioresistant tumors, neurologic deterioration during irradiation, and the presence of spinal instability or bone compression of the neural structures. The location of the compressing tumor will dictate the surgical approach--a vertebral body resection in an anterior or anterolateral tumor and a laminectomy in a posterior or posterolateral deposit. Modern instrumentation techniques for spinal column stabilization or vertebral body replacement will allow immediate painless ambulation and a better quality of life for these patients."
CD008686,0,2779779,0,Iatrogenic intraspinal epidermoid tumor: myelo-CT and MRI diagnosis.,"An 11-year-old boy, treated for acute lymphatic leukemia at the age of 2 with intrathecal injections of Methotrexate, presented with a two year history of pain and signs of lumbo-sacral lesion. MRI, myelography and myelo-CT demonstrated an intradural L4-L5 epidermoid tumor which was removed. Iatrogenic implantation of epithelial cells at the age of two with lumbar punctures is most likely. Decline in incidence of lumbar iatrogenic epidermoid cysts, now an exceedingly rare event, is probably related to improved needles for lumbar punctures."
CD008686,0,2774882,0,Two-stage therapy in the treatment of sacral tumors.,"Sacral tumors are rare and may be clinically overlooked for a long period, because the symptoms and signs are often mild and non-specific. This led to frequent errors in clinical diagnosis and a long delay between the onset of symptoms and treatment. On presentation the lesions frequently expanded the anterior cortex, however, in most patients the periosteum of the sacrum and the presacral fascia form an unbroken barrier for a tumor. The pelvic viscera are not infiltrated by the tumor until late. Wide excision is difficult and often causes urogenital and/or anorectal dysfunction, but preserving the sacral nerve roots often leads to local recurrence. Surgical wide excision with a combined anterior-posterior approach is considered the treatment of choice for large lesions with significant anterior intrapelvic extension. This paper reports data resulting from the treatment of five large sacral tumors with comments on the results."
CD008686,0,2736314,0,[Response of bone metastases to medical treatment: definition of evaluation criteria and classification trials].,"Bone metastases are very frequent. Some are sensitive to the action of anticancer drugs. However, there is as yet an unsolved methodological problem in the evaluation of response to these drugs. The uniquely radiological UICC criteria are quite insufficient, in as much as they appear with a long delay and sometimes give erroneous results. In this work we give a brief review of biological and clinical knowledge about bone metastases, and we attempt to give an array of the possible evaluation criteria and their respective value. We propose as a working hypothesis a classification of responses taking into account the criteria: the urinary hydroxyproline to urinary creatinine ratio, the serum dosage of bone isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase and propeptide of type III procollagen (P III NP), and as an essential element, an analysis of all available imaging techniques. A visual study of bone scintillation scans must precede that of radiographs and, when possible, it must be associated to computerized scintillation scanning. When metastasis are located to the pelvis, the vertebral column, or the sternum, a CT scan or better, a nuclear magnetic resonance study (IRM), is indispensable in order to have a direct measure of the tumor extension to soft tissues. Furthermore, in the case of isolated metastases, one of these imaging techniques allows a diagnostic biopsy. Finally an analysis of response at the bone level will always be associated with a measure of their duration and an evaluation of metastases to other sites."
CD008686,0,2698448,0,"[Vertebral hemangioma with neurologic signs. Clinical presentation, results of a survey by the French Society of Neurosurgery].","45 cases of vertebral hemangiomas with neurologic involvement are reported. This series corresponds to the french experience between 1969 and 1988 (series of the ""Société Française de Neurochirurgie"" (S.F.N.)). In this report the clinical presentation and the results of the radiological examination are detailed. Local vertebral pain was present in half of the cases. The neurological symptoms were related to spinal cord compression in 33/45 of the patients and to radicular suffering in the other cases. Evolution of the neurological symptoms appeared to be slow: the mean evolution time before diagnosis was of 10 months. Hemangioma involved the thoracic column in 73% of the cases. Neurologic symptoms was due to a diffuse narrowing of the spinal canal in 28.8% of the cases, to a local bony expansion in 60% of the cases. Hemangioma was found to involve the whole vertebra in 44.4% of the cases, the vertebral body alone in 24.4% of the cases and the posterior arch alone in 22.2% of the cases. An incomplete involvement of both vertebral body and posterior arch was found in 6.6% of the cases. 2.2% of the cases corresponded to pure epidural hemangioma. Preoperative diagnosis was established in 58% of the patients. In these cases, the diagnosis was based on standard radiography and CT datas. Results of the S.F.N. serie are compared with those of the main series of the literature."
CD008686,0,2678235,0,[The value of spinal CT in the planning of spinal surgery].,"The diagnostic information gained by spinal CT for the planning of surgery of spinal disease is discussed under clinical aspects. For discogenic disease CT has replaced myelography in significance and as primary investigation, except for unclear complaints, that cannot be attributed to a specific segment. Here myelography still is the prime investigation. With CT degenerative peripheral appendages turned out to be significant for secondary stenosis syndromes of the spinal canal. In future it seems advisable, to differentiate between the facultatively pathogenetic important dorsal spondylosis and ventro-lateral spondylosis, which is unimportant for the spinal complaints. If surgical correction of congenital spinal malformations is considered, apparent or silent dysraphia must be ruled out in order to prevent neurological complications. Here CT can improve diagnostic safety significantly. For the resection of tumourous or inflammatory destructions CT provides an excellent means for preoperative statements on the necessary resection area, the size of the graft and the strength of adjacent soft tissues for the graft, the required stabilisation instruments, possible effects on adjacent organs, lumen reduction of the spinal canal, and the appropriate surgical entrance. The exploration of traumatic conditions of the spinal column by CT is of value especially for a detailed preoperative investigation, since it facilitates a quantification of the destruction of the vertebral body and the arches, the condition of the posterior body surface and the stenosis of the spinal canal."
CD008686,0,2672715,0,Myelotomies for chronic pain.,"The literature on myelotomy for the treatment of chronic pain was reviewed and a total of 635 published cases scrutinized. Two main modes of myelotomy can be distinguished 1) a longitudinal commissural section tuned to the segmental pain level and 2) a focused central lesion, irrespective of considerations of the metameric pain distribution, mainly carried out at a high cervical level. Of the longitudinal commissural myelotomy, a posteriorly restricted and a complete type can moreover be discerned. The pain relief decays with time after myelotomy of any kind. Central myelotomy scores better than complete commissural section for malignant pain in a statistically significant manner but its superiority over posterior commissurotomy cannot be statistically proven. Except of a girdle-shaped hypo-algesia, which is expected after the section of the decussating spinothalamic fibers in a complete commissurotomy, other--irregular--patterns of hypo-algesia have been observed, especially after central myelotomy. This unusual lesion, provoking unusual hypo-algesia patterns, together with phenomena like a preserved sharp-blunt-discrimination within the hypo-algesic area, points at a different sensory channel that might be severed in a central myelotomy as compared with an anterolateral chordotomy or a complete commissurotomy. This hypothesis is matched with recent physiological evidences."
CD008686,0,2654681,0,[Synovial cysts and synovialomas of the lumbar spine. Histo-pathologic and neuro-surgical aspects apropos of 8 cases].,"Based on 8 personal cases and a 81-cases review of literature, it's authors' opinion that cystic or solid masses issued form posterior lumbar articular process and called according to the cases synovial cyst, ganglion cyst, benign synovialoma, pigmented villonodular synovitis, are a single variety of benign degeneration of soft articular tissues. The cystic or solid feature of these masses depends upon the extent of their histiocytic granulomatous proliferation. They may be asymptomatic, accompany chronic lumbar pain or cause sciatica, seldom cauda equina syndrome. In case of sciatica, clinical picture rather consists of a narrow lateral recess than a discal protrusion. CT scan is the best investigation to get a right preoperative diagnosis. Postoperative prognosis is excellent and no anatomical recurrence has been reported."
CD008686,0,2651956,0,[Tethered cord syndrome of adult onset: report of a case and a review of the literature].,"A 47-year-old female was admitted with complaints of spontaneous pain at the medial surface of the right thigh, and worsening of urinary incontinence and weakness of the legs. These phenomena had been noticed previously 20 years ago, and again 10 years ago, respectively. There was a scar like skin abnormality of 4 X 6 cm over the lumbosacral region. Compression on this region induced neuralgic pain around the anus radiating down to both legs. Neurologically, weakness of the legs, sensory impairment on the L2-S5 dermatomes and urinary incontinence were recognized. Plain X-P revealed spina bifida on the lower lumber and sacral vertebrae (L4-S1), where a low density mass was found by spinal CT. Metrizamide CT myelography and MRI disclosed medullaris to be low and the spinal cord to be elongated. There was a meningocele surrounded by subcutaneous lipoma at the caudal end of the spinal cord at L5 level. Upon operation, a meningocele containing neural elements and adherent to the intra and extra-dural lipoma was found protruding through the laminar defect. Lipoma was removed partially. The conus medullaris and cauda equina were freed from the surrounding tissue. Dural plasty using the Lyodura was made. Postoperatively, the pain disappeared and her gait disturbance and sensory impairment were significantly improved, but urinary incontinence remained unchanged. Fifty-six cases of tethered cord syndrome of adult onset were reviewed from the literatures. Clinical symptoms, etiologies of the tethering, surgical outcomes and factors causing symptoms were discussed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008686,0,2614510,0,Osteoid osteoma of the spine: radiological aspects and value of arteriography. Four cases.,"The authors present four cases of osteoid osteoma of the spine and review the usual clinical and paraclinical data leading to its diagnosis. The value of radionuclide bone scanning is emphasized: it supersedes the often disappointing radio-tomography and guides computerized tomography which, with modern scanners, virtually always demonstrates the lesion and locates it with accuracy. In the author's experience, spinal and spinal cord arteriography plays an important role: it identifies the radiculospinal vessels preoperatively and provides additional aetiological arguments based on the usual hypervascularity of osteoid osteomas and on the pain induced by injection of the feeding vessels. Data from the literature concerning the vascularization of the nidus suggest that treatment by embolization alone can be envisaged but must be demonstrated."
CD008686,0,2594207,0,Spinal cord compression caused by plasmocytomas. A retrospective review of 14 cases.,"Plasmocytoma is a plasma cell tumor, which occurs in various structures of the body. When the spinal column is involved, it may cause cord compression. In this study, 14 cases of spinal plasmocytomas are presented. Seven of them were male and seven female. The major complaints were pain in twelve cases, motor weakness in eight cases, and bladder disturbance in six cases. On neurological examination, twelve of the patients had impairment of extremity movements (85.7%), and eight had sensory losses (57.1%). Compression was more frequent in the thoracic region. There was a total block in nine and partial block in five cases. All patients underwent surgery. In thirteen cases laminectomy was performed, in one thoracotomy. In this report, complaints, clinical and laboratory findings, neurological examination, and histopathology of our cases are reviewed and the results discussed."

CD008686,0,2568789,0,Neural tolerance of iotrolan 300 in ascending cervical myelography: results of a multicenter study.,"This study examined the opacification, dose, and tolerance of iotrolan 300 on 231 patients in ascending cervical myelography. The contrast was rated good in 188 (81.4%) of the cases and satisfactory in 40 (17.3%) of the cases. The contrast was poor in only three (1.3%) cases. In 152 patients a dose of 10 ml or less of iotrolan 300 was administered. A good contrast quality was obtained in 84.2% of all examinations. From a total of 231 patients, 146 exhibited no concomitant effects. The intensity of the headache and neck ache was recorded by the patients themselves by means of an analog scale. The frequency and degree of the postmyelographic complaints did not increase with higher doses, i.e., they were not dose dependent. Neurologic irritation, in the form of radicular symptoms, appeared in only 2 of 231 examinations. These data demonstrate that iotrolan 300 is excellent for use in ascending cervical myelography."
CD008686,0,2521444,1,Selective criteria may increase lumbosacral spine roentgenogram use in acute low-back pain.,"Eleven clinical criteria have been proposed to limit use of lumbosacral spine roentgenograms in patients with acute low-back pain who are at risk for vertebral cancer, osteomyelitis, acute fracture, or herniated disk. We retrospectively applied the criteria to 471 patients with acute low-back pain in three teaching hospital walk-in clinics. Roentgenograms were obtained at the initial visit in 99 patients (21.1%); the number would have increased to 217 (46.1%) if the criteria had been used. The following four patient characteristics were associated with actual roentgenogram use: older age, longer duration of symptoms, reflex asymmetry, and point vertebral tenderness. Adoption of the 11 criteria studied herein may inadvertently increase roentgenogram use, thereby raising health care costs and exposing more patients to gonadal irradiation. The standard of practice in these three clinics seemed to entail use of less broad roentgenogram selection criteria. Other published guidelines for roentgenograms emphasize clinical follow-up, reserving further evaluation for patients who fail to improve after a trial of bed rest and analgesics."
CD008686,0,2483138,0,Samarium-153 EDTMP therapy of disseminated skeletal metastasis.,"153Sm-EDTMP (ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonate), prepared from a kit, was administered to 28 patients in a clinical trial of therapy for painful skeletal metastases unresponsive to all conventional treatment. The 103 keV gamma emission of 153Sm was utilized for prospective individual estimation of beta radiation absorbed dose to red marrow to minimize myelotoxicity and provide optimum internal radiotherapy to skeletal metastases in each patient. Pain relief occurred within 14 days of administration of 153Sm-EDTMP in 15 of 19 patients (79%) who could be evaluated at 6 weeks, when clinical response was maximal. Duration of response ranged from 4 to 35 weeks. Recurrence of pain responded to retreatment with 153Sm-EDTMP in five of eight cases. No dose-response relationship was apparent for pain relief but reversible myelotoxicity was frequently observed at radiation absorbed doses to bone marrow greater than or equal to 270 cGy. Dosimetry calculation was based on pharmacokinetic studies of a tracer administration of 153Sm-EDTMP in each patient. Assumptions inherent in this prospective method of predicting dose to bone marrow were validated experimentally. Biodistribution studies in rats demonstrated rapid skeletal uptake and long term retention of 153Sm-EDTMP in bone over 5 days. Urinary clearance accounted for 40% of injected dose, and less than 1.0% of administered activity was retained in non osseous tissue. Microdensitometry of autoradiographs of sheep vertebra and femur confirmed surface uptake of 153Sm-EDTMP in cortical bone and demonstrated relatively high trabecular bone activity which is the major component of radiation absorbed dose to bone marrow. Haematological studies in rabbits showed 153Sm-EDTMP-induced myelotoxicity to be transient and no histopathological abnormalities were demonstrable with doses ten times greater than those administered to patients."
CD008686,0,3263774,0,CT-guided nerve root block and ablation.,"We report our experience in performing 52 CT-guided peripheral nerve root blocks and 27 CT-guided nerve root ablations. The nerve root block procedures were performed as diagnostic tests to determine the clinical significance of equivocal herniated disk or foraminal stenosis (n = 33) and before nerve root ablations (n = 19). To evaluate the clinical significance of these nerve root blocks, we performed 52 procedures at the vertebral level where a herniated disk or foraminal stenosis had been identified on CT or MR images. In 51 of 52 cases, the procedures were successful in anesthetizing the intended nerve root, which allowed us to determine whether that particular nerve root was the source of pain. By relieving or not relieving pain, the results of the diagnostic nerve root blocks helped determine whether a protrusion or foraminal stenosis was clinically significant. The nerve root ablations were done exclusively for treatment of pain in patients with malignant disease. Significant relief of pain was obtained in 17 (63%) of 27 patients. The thoracic nerve ablations were the most successful (9/10 or 90%) because the correct thoracic nerve innervation to the offending lesion could be identified. The lumbosacral nerve ablation procedures were the least successful (6/14 or 43%) because the innervation of the pelvic neoplasms was complex, arising from multiple lumbosacral nerves that often were bilateral. Equivocal foraminal stenosis and disk protrusion are common findings on CT and MR imaging, and CT-guided nerve block procedures can help determine which of these findings are clinically significant. CT-guided nerve root ablations have limited efficacy but can help control pain in patients with a malignant disease, especially when the pain is in the distribution of a thoracic nerve dermatome."
CD008686,0,3249101,0,[A clinical study on acute non-traumatic myelopathies].,"Seventy-two cases of acute non-traumatic myelopathy in which walking became impossible within one week after the onset of paralysis were investigated. Fifty-one cases (71%) consisted of mass lesions requiring surgery, such as metastatic spine tumors, hemangioma of spinal cord and hematoma within the spinal canal. Others were 6 cases of anterior spinal artery syndrome and 15 cases of undetermined diagnosis. Pain preceding paralysis or paralysis itself was the initial symptom in 64% of the spinal metastases. Severe pain followed by rapidly progressive paralysis was associated with the vascular lesions. Myelography was generally the most useful diagnostic tool of mass lesions and angiography was also useful in vascular lesions. Walking ability was recovered in 23 of 47 cases after spinal decompression. Postoperative recovery was especially marked when operation was done in the stage of incomplete paralysis. Locating the mass lesion and timely decompression were the most important approaches for handling these conditions."
CD008686,0,3145091,0,Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis. A clinical and population study in south-east Wales.,"A population-based study in south-east Wales (population 668,100) identified 135 patients with von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (prevalence 20/10(5]. In addition to multiple café-au-lait spots and/or dermal neurofibromas, freckling was present in the axilla (67%), groin (44%) or submammary areas (29% of adult females). Although not a criterion for diagnosis, Lisch nodules were almost invariably present in the iris (93% of patients overall; 96% of those aged greater than or equal to 20 yrs). The complications of von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis in this cohort (n = 135 unless stated) were plexiform neurofibromas (40/125), severe mental retardation (1), epilepsy (6), optic glioma (2), spinal neurofibroma (2), aqueduct stenosis (2), meningioangiomatosis (1), scoliosis requiring surgery (6), pseudoarthrosis (3), delayed puberty (2), visceral and endocrine tumours (6), and congenital glaucoma (1). There were no cases of acoustic neuroma. Considering all living family members aged greater than or equal to 18 yrs, together with their deceased relatives, the frequency of CNS and malignant tumours related to the disease was 4.4-5.2%. Uncomplicated von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is disfiguring but not a major cause of morbidity. The management of the disease relates to its complications which can be divided into three categories: those which occur in childhood and cause lifelong morbidity (moderate-severe mental handicap, facial plexiform neurofibromas, orthopaedic), those which can occur at any time but are 'treatable' (benign disorders of the nervous system, visceral and endocrine tumours, renal artery stenosis), and malignant or CNS tumours. The combined frequency for each category based on this survey was 12%, 16% and 4.4-5.2%, respectively."
CD008686,0,3068689,0,Neck pain.,"Six conditions cause most of the neck pain complaints seen by primary care physicians: cervical muscle strain or sprain, torticollis, acceleration injury, myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome, and cervical osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Most of them can be diagnosed and treated by the primary care physician. Of the more unusual causes, one should not miss a clinical fracture; a herniated cervical disc, spinal cord compression from a disc, or epidural tumor; infection of the disc or the vertebral body; subluxation of the vertebral bodies; or pain referred from the chest or mediastinal structures. MRI offers new opportunity for early diagnosis of myelopathy owing to OA or RA, vertebral osteomyelitis, and metastatic involvement of cervical vertebrae."

CD008686,0,3056289,0,"The spinal accessory nerve plexus, the trapezius muscle, and shoulder stabilization after radical neck cancer surgery.","A clinical and anatomic study of the spinal accessory, the eleventh cranial nerve, and trapezius muscle function of patients who had radical neck cancer surgery was conducted. This study was done not only to document the indispensibility of the trapezius muscle to shoulder-girdle stability, but also to clarify the role of the eleventh cranial nerve in the variable motor and sensory changes occurring after the loss of this muscle. Seventeen male patients, 49-69 years of age, (average of 60 years of age) undergoing a total of 23 radical neck dissections were examined for upper extremity function, particularly in regard to the trapezius muscle, and for subjective signs of pain. The eleventh nerve, usually regarded as the sole motor innervation to the trapezius, was cut in 17 instances because of tumor involvement. Dissection of four fresh and 30 preserved adult cadavers helped to reconcile the motor and sensory differences in patients who had undergone loss of the eleventh nerve. The dissections and clinical observations corroborate that the trapezius is a key part of a ""muscle continuum"" that stabilizes the shoulder. Variations in origins and insertions of the trapezius may influence its function in different individuals. As regards the spinal accessory nerve, it is concluded that varying motor and sensory connections form a plexus with the eleventh nerve, accounting, in part, for the variations in motor innervation and function of the trapezius, as well as for a variable spectrum of sensory changes when the eleventh nerve is cut. For this reason, it is suggested that the term ""spinal accessory nerve plexus"" be used to refer to the eleventh nerve when it is considered in the context of radical neck cancer surgery."
CD008686,0,2976124,0,[Spinal intramedullary tumor with exophytic growth].,"We experienced 22 cases of spinal intramedullary tumor, in which 5 cases were accompanied with exophytic growth. We discussed their clinical and radiological features, and therapeutic problems. Concerning the locations of tumors with exophytic growth, the most common site was conus medullaris, accounting for 60% (3 cases). Histopathological findings were astrocytoma in two cases, and in one case, mixed glioma, ependymoma and hemangioblastoma. In neurological observation, the most common initial symptom was back pain and lumbago, suggesting root pain. No neurological features distinguishable from those of extramedullary tumors were presented. In radiological examination, myelography and CT myelography were very helpful for diagnosis. Myelography and CT myelography showed extramedullary mass, shift and deformity of spinal cord that was not serious as compared with the size of extramedullary mass, and showed the portion where the spinal cord was swollen. Good outcomes were obtained in a case with total removal, and two cases with subtotal and partial removal that were managed with additional irradiation and chemotherapy. However recurrence and intracranial seeding made prognosis poor in two cases where total removal was impossible. We thought that postoperative careful follow-up was necessary not only to detect recurrence but also to detect intracranial seeding in the cases of spinal intramedullary tumor with exophytic growth."
CD008686,0,2907271,0,[Continuous intrathecal opiate therapy with a portable drug pump in cancer pain].,"Terminal cancer patients report substantial pain frequently. Pain control can be achieved in many patients with conventional methods and analgesics. However, significant numbers of patients remain in pain. For these patients, continuous intrathecal narcotics delivered by an external portable pump via a subcutaneous port, offer substantially improved pain control with minimal risk of serious systemic complications. Duration of treatment in our 40 cancer patients lasted up to 11 month. Continuous intrathecal morphine or fentanyl relieved pain till death due to cancer. Supraspinal side effects of opioids were only seen during the first week of intrathecal narcotic treatment. No serious complications like meningitis or other infections were observed. Postmortem examination also could not detect changes of the cord or signs of arachnoiditis due to intrathecal narcotics or the implanted catheter. We conclude, that continuous intrathecal narcotic infusion by means of small portable pump is a very efficient method to control terminal cancer pain and enables treatment on an outpatient basis until death."
CD008686,0,3414994,0,Pain scores and ventilatory and circulatory sequelae of epidural morphine in cancer patients with and without prior narcotic therapy.,"Pain scores and respiratory and circulatory sequelae of epidural morphine were studied in 25 patients with cancer, classified into two groups: 15 with and 10 without a history of previous narcotic analgesic therapy. Morphine, 2.5 mg initially and 5.0 mg 12 hours later, was given through an indwelling lumbar epidural catheter. Pain scores, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and minute volume, arterial PO2 and PCO2, and arterial pH were measured for 24 hours. Both groups had the same degree of analgesia after each epidural dose, suggesting that local morphine concentrations seen with epidural administration may be sufficient to overcome any degree of tolerance that may have developed at the spinal level during previous systemic narcotic administration. Statistically significant dose-dependent hypoventilation and concomitant respiratory acidosis were seen in both groups, the changes being significantly greater in opiate-naive patients. These results demonstrate that the ventilatory depressant actions of opioids are attenuated but not eliminated in narcotic-familiar cancer patients and that epidural narcotics are as effective in relieving pain in narcotic-naive patients as in patients previously exposed to narcotics for relief of cancer pain."

CD008686,0,3060751,0,[Spinal melanotic schwannoma: report of a case].,"A case of spinal dumbbell shaped melanotic schwannoma was reported. A 58-year-old housewife had a 3-months history of progressive gait disturbance. She also complained of mild backache and numbness in both legs. Her family history was not remarkable. When examined on admission, October 10, 1982, mild weakness of both legs with spasticity and sensory impairment below the level of T10 dermatome without sacral sparing were evident. Her deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive on both sides and plantar responses were extensor bilaterally. Sphincteric disturbance was not significant. The function of her cranial nerves was intact. She had neither cutaneous lesions, abdominal mass nor organomegaly. Thoracic plain X-rays revealed erosion of the right side vertebral body and pedicle of the 10th thoracic vertebra. Myelography disclosed a complete block at the same level by an epidural mass. On CT-myelogram, soft tissue density mass compressing the thoracic cord was apparent in the right epidural space of the spinal canal which extended to the paravertebral region through the right intervertebral foramen. Partial destruction of the body and the right side pedicle was easily recognized. Laminectomy from T9 to T11 exposed a large extradural mass which was encapsulated, elastic soft and pigmented in nature. The tumor was dumbbell shaped and extended to the right paravertebral region through the intervertebral foramen. Costotransversectomy was performed to excise the mass entirely. Following the total removal of the tumor, internal fixation was carried out by means of Harrington instrumentation with methylmethacrylate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,3398597,0,Insufficiency fractures of the pelvis that simulate metastatic disease.,"Insufficiency fractures of the pelvis, which almost always occur in elderly women with osteoporosis, are often misinterpreted as metastatic disease. The initial symptom of such fractures is severe pain unassociated with an obvious history of trauma. The typical sites of involvement are the sacrum, the iliac bones, and the pubis. The plain film appearance of the sacral and iliac fractures is usually subtle and easily overlooked, and bone scans will show the abnormal areas more readily. The existence of multiple fractures not only in the pelvis but also in the vertebrae and ribs should suggest the diagnosis of insufficiency-type stress fractures. Computed tomography can exclude the presence of a destructive process and an associated soft tissue mass, as would be seen in metastatic disease. If insufficiency fractures are identified in the typical anatomic locations, bone biopsy is unnecessary."
CD008686,0,3174151,0,A double-blind comparison between epidural morphine and epidural clonidine in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.,"In a randomised double-blind study of 20 patients with chronic pain, epidural morphine 5 mg in 5 ml of saline was compared with epidural clonidine 150 micrograms in 5 ml of saline. Thirteen patients had a clinical and radiological diagnosis of arachnoiditis, 6 had low back pain and 1 had post-operative scar pain. There were 18 females and 2 males with an average age of 52 years, range 22-76 years. There was no difference found between the 2 solutions in the resultant analgesia measured by the visual analogue scale for pain, pain relief or the pain word score during the 3 h period of the study. No difference was found in the patient's mood which was also measured with the visual analogue scale. Two patients had no analgesia from either injection, 2 patients did not obtain any relief from clonidine and another 2 obtained no relief from morphine. Six patients reported that clonidine was better than morphine, 5 reported that morphine and clonidine were the same and 3 reported that morphine was better than clonidine. The duration of analgesia from the clonidine varied from 6 h to 1 month; the duration of analgesia from morphine varied from 6 to 24 h. Clonidine was associated with sedation and a fall in blood pressure of greater than 20 mm Hg in all patients, 1 patient required ephedrine to treat hypotension. Twelve patients had pruritus, 7 nausea and 2 vomiting following the morphine. Statistically there was no difference found between morphine and clonidine for short-term (3 h) analgesia in these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,3365676,0,Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract by metastases from germ cell tumors of the testis.,"Six cases of metastatic germ cell tumors of the testis involving the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are reported. Three cases were primary seminomas, and three were nonseminomatous. All six cases involved the upper GI tract, three occurring at presentation and three at relapse, with a disease-free interval of 3 months to 10 years. Isolated GI involvement did not occur. The presumed mode of spread was by haematogenous dissemination in three and direct extension from paraaortic lymph nodes in three. Symptoms suggestive of involvement were severe abdominal pain secondary to high intestinal obstruction or mucosal ulceration, severe lumbar pain, and symptoms of anemia as a result of clinically evident or occult blood loss. Four patients were now disease-free after chemotherapy, one died of an unrelated illness, and one patient was receiving treatment for relapsing disease."
CD008686,0,3357965,0,Early sequelae of gunshot wounds to the spine: radiologic diagnosis.,"During a 6-month period, 11 consecutive patients who had delayed neurologic deterioration after sustaining a gunshot wound to the spine were prospectively evaluated clinically, radiologically, and surgically. The patients had dysesthetic burning pain in an anesthetic area, hyperhidrosis, flexor spasm, and additional motor deficit above the level of cord injury 2-22 weeks after injury. Radiologic evaluation consisted of plain radiography of the spine and metrizamide myelography followed by computed tomography. A syringomyelic cavity was found in seven patients, an arachnoid cyst in three, and osteomyelitis in one. Seven of these patients also had cord atrophy. Postoperatively, dysesthetic pain was relieved in all the patients. There was no recurrence during a 2-year follow-up. These results emphasize the need for immediate radiologic investigation in patients with gunshot wounds of the spine who have further deterioration superimposed on their initial deficit."
CD008686,0,3130209,0,The orthopedic manifestation of neurofibromatosis. A clinical experience and review of the literature.,"A retrospective review of 47 patients with neurofibromatosis was performed to evaluate the effects of that disease on patient function and disability. Clinical manifestations were distributed as follows: cafe-au-lait markings were the most prevalent manifestation (87%), followed by a positive family history (49%), scoliosis (53%), neurofibromata (19%), and pseudarthrosis of the tibia (19%). The classic scoliosis was resistant to brace treatment; bracing failed in 70% of patients, necessitating spinal fusion. Pseudarthrosis of the tibia can be subdivided into normal, narrow sclerotic, and cystic medullary canal groups. This study supported the theory that tibias with narrow sclerotic medullary canals should be prophylactically braced until skeletal maturity to prevent fracture. Once fractured, the incidence of non-union is high regardless of treatment mode. Eighty percent of patients with pseudarthrosis of the tibia did not heal with multiple bone grafts and were amputated below the knee. Many patients in this study were educable or only mildly mentally retarded, and performed quite well in activities of daily living."
CD008686,0,2967893,0,"Cancer as a cause of back pain: frequency, clinical presentation, and diagnostic strategies.","Back pain is very common. Rarely, it may be the first manifestation of cancer. Although many advocate selective use of laboratory and x-ray tests for back pain patients, the early detection of cancer may be an important reason to obtain such tests. To develop a diagnostic approach that would identify malignancies while remaining parsimonious, the authors evaluated 1,975 walk-in patients with a chief complaint of back pain. Thirteen patients (0.66%) proved to have underlying cancer. Findings significantly associated with underlying cancer (p less than 0.05) were: age greater than or equal to 50 years, previous history of cancer, duration of pain greater than 1 month, failure to improve with conservative therapy, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and anemia. Combining historical features and ESR results led to an algorithm that would have limited x-ray utilization to just 22% of subjects while recommending an x-ray for every cancer patient. It would further suggest which patients with negative x-ray findings require further work-up."

Analysis of 116 cases].,"The primary clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings of 116 patients with plasmacytoma were analysed and correlated. Skeletal findings could be seen on the radiograms of 105 of 116 patients (= 90.5%): All of the five patients with solitary plasmacytoma and 96 of 111 patients with multiple myeloma showed osteolyses; four of 111 patients with multiple myeloma showed sole osteoporosis. The leading clinical symptom was skeletal pain; whenever the pain was located in the spine skeletal findings were evident. Paraproteinaemia turned out to be the most important laboratory finding. Its proportion depended on the grade of radiological findings."
CD008686,0,3375473,0,[Computerized tomography of the spine in the evaluation of multiple myeloma].,"Computed Tomography (CT) of the spine was performed on 17 patients with myeloma in order to assess the role of the technique in recognizing and evaluating the extent of the lesions. Myelomatous lesions followed two patterns at CT: first of all, multiple focal lesions, whose density is either solid, liquid, or fatty; second, an extensive pattern involving the spongiosa of the vertebra, including the posterior arch. CT detected more lesions than conventional radiology; furthermore, the extent of the lesions was much better demonstrated by CT. CT should thus be performed: a) in case of pain and/or neurological findings in negative radiological examinations; b) to evaluate the extent of myelomatous lesions (mainly in the spine); c) in solitary myeloma CT may be performed on different bone segments with clinical symptomatology but normal X-ray findings."
CD008686,0,3364150,0,Clinical experience of long-term treatment with epidural and intrathecal opioids--a nationwide survey.,"Long-term use of spinal opioids to treat chronic severe pain is widely established. However, the indications, shortcomings and complications of the method have not been completely described. Experience with spinal opioids was analysed for the period 1979-1984 in a nationwide Swedish survey. Out of 93 anaesthesia departments, 69 used the method. Approximately 750 patients were treated with epidural morphine for an average duration of 124 days (3-450). Eighteen patients were treated with intrathecal morphine for an average period for 47 days (3-90). The intrathecal approach was used in all clinics because of failure of the epidural route. In only one department was the intrathecal approach used as the primary route of therapy, depending on the mechanism of pain. The highest daily morphine dose was 480 mg and 50 mg for epidural and intrathecal routes, respectively. The patients given the highest dosages were not necessarily those subjected to the longest treatment. The need for increased dosage seems to be related not only to changes in receptor sensitivity but also to changes in pain mechanisms. No case of threatening ventilatory depression was reported. Thirty-two departments had treated a few patients with chronic non-cancer pain conditions. Initial results were considered ""excellent"" in 11 departments, but at follow-up results were excellent in only one department. In addition to dislocation, occlusion of the catheters or leakage, injection pain was an obstacle to successful treatment. Pruritus urinary retention, and local infections were not reported as significant problems, but one case of meningitis was reported."
CD008686,0,3353839,0,Ependymomas: a clinicopathologic study.,"Since 1924, when ependymomas were first classified as a distinctive glial neoplasm by Bailey, much has been published concerning these tumors, but there are important points of interest that are still not clear. In order to study more fully the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the ependymoma, we identified 62 patients with histologically proven neoplasms. Twenty-two were supratentorial, 21 were infratentorial, and 19 were intramedullary spinal cord tumors. These groups had mean ages of 17, 7, and 41 years, respectively, at the time of first symptoms. The presenting and accompanying symptoms were related to location and included headaches, nausea, visual changes, hemiparesis, and neck, back, and radicular pain. Neurological signs included papilledema, nystagmus, gait disturbance, cranial nerve palsies, altered mental status, paraparesis, and sensory dysfunction. Radiologic modalities of particular importance included computed tomography and myelography. Surgery and radiation therapy were the primary treatment modalities with median survival times from first symptoms being 92, 36, and 117 months for the above groups, respectively. Based on computer-generated survival curves, several characteristics significantly affected survival. These included tumor site, age, and neuraxis metastases. In patients with supratentorial tumors, cranial nerve palsies, microcystic changes, and mitotic figures were important, while in patients with infratentorial tumors, widened sutures, increased head circumference, age, epithelial features, and subependymal features significantly affected survival. Patients who had complete gross resection of a spinal cord tumor had no recurrences or mortality."
CD008686,0,3350348,0,Neck pain in the elderly: common causes and management.,"Neck pain is common in the elderly. An outline of the relevant anatomy and pathological conditions which affect the cervical spine and an approach to diagnosis are presented. Intrinsic causes of pain arise in the vertebral column itself--arthritis, discogenic disorders, trauma, tumors, and infection; in the cervical musculature--myofascial pain syndrome, torticollis, and whiplash; and in the spinal cord from tumors. Differentiation of these causes from extrinsic causes of neck pain will enable the appropriate management protocols to be implemented. Many of these problems can be treated effectively at the primary care level. Guidelines for specialist referral are suggested."
CD008686,0,3284266,0,Opioid treatment for radiating cancer pain: oral administration vs. epidural techniques.,"In order to determine the optimal pain treatment for patients with cancer involvement of the brachial or lumbar nerve plexuses, a prospective comparative study was carried out using peroral opioid therapy (SO), epidural opioid by a conventional tunnelled epidural catheter (CE) or an epidural catheter connected to an implanted injection port (Port). Pain relief, measured by a visual analog scale (VAS), was similar and adequate in every group already after the first 24 h. CNS side-effects were less frequent and the Karnofsky performance grades slightly superior in the epidural groups. Occlusion and catheter disconnection complicated the pain therapy of five epidural port patients. Epidural dislocation occurred three times in the conventional epidural group. One local infection in the CE group and two in the Port group were recorded. However, no signs of epidural infection were seen at autopsy. The results suggest that due to a lower incidence of side-effects, epidural catheter techniques are superior to peroral opioid in treating pain in these patients. However, complete pain relief was not achieved in all patients, suggesting neurogenic, non-nociceptive pain components. Both epidural techniques seem suitable for long-term pain therapy. Technical improvements are needed in the epidural catheter and the port. The long-term epidural catheter does not seem to cause any major changes in the histology of the dura mater or the connective tissue of the epidural space."
CD008686,0,3211594,0,Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies of a primary aortic intimal sarcoma.,"An intimal sarcoma of the abdominal aorta in a 63-year-old woman is reported. The clinical symptoms consisted of chronic arterial hypertension, vomiting and epigastric pain. Treatment was operative, but the patient died 20 hours after surgery. The studies were performed on a surgical specimen and on autopsy material. The aortic tumour consisted of pleomorphic spindle-shaped and giant cells. In the vertebral metastases a storiform pattern of the tumour cells was found. No specific features characteristic for leiomyogenic, lipogenic or an endothelial nature of the tumour giant cells was disclosed in electron microscopy and the picture rather indicated their histiocytic character. Of the 18 cellular markers studied, the immunostainings for vimentin and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin were evidently positive. The tumour was classified as a pleomorphic intimal aortic sarcoma probably a malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). The literature on 26 previously published aortal tumours is reviewed with emphasis on their topographical distribution and histological classification. In only 4 previous cases was the final diagnosis supported by electron microscopical or immunopathological findings. The role of marker studies in the classification of aortal tumours is discussed."
CD008686,0,2451493,0,Bilateral neuralgic amyotrophy induced by interferon treatment.,"Neurologic side effects of interferon therapy usually consist of diffuse involvement of the central and peripheral nervous systems. We describe a patient with hairy cell leukemia who developed bilateral neuralgic amyotrophy, sacral radicular irritation, and worsening of a preexistent polyneuropathy during treatment with recombinant interferon. A sample of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid showed an increased protein content and oligoclonal banding. Several weeks after discontinuation of interferon therapy, Mees-Beau lines became evident on the patient's fingernails. The findings in this patients, as well as those recently reported by others, show that focal neurologic disturbances may be induced by interferon therapy. The clinical picture of neuralgic amyotrophy is briefly reviewed."

CD008686,0,3351037,0,Radiation induced fractures of sacrum: CT diagnosis.,Sacral insufficiency fracture due to bone atrophy may develop as a complication of irradiation of pelvic malignancies. Pain is the presenting symptom and the clinical diagnoses most often considered are recurrence of the original malignancy and metastatic disease. Computed tomography provides the most specific information helpful for the detection of these fractures and for exclusion of recurrent malignancy.
CD008686,0,2965758,0,Back pain and epidural spinal cord compression.,"The physician must have a high index of suspicion to detect SCC early in patients with malignancy. Back pain is the first symptom in almost all patients, and the diagnosis should be considered for all older patients with back pain. Asking about back pain should be a routine part of the review of systems, especially for patients with known malignancies. Clinically, it is impossible to tell whether or not a patient who has back pain and cancer has epidural SCC. Patients may be stratified as to the likelihood of SCC using the history and physical examination, but the diagnosis relies on radiographic visualization of the spinal cord. It may be acceptable to closely follow patients with normal neurologic examinations and normal plain films, but even this is controversial and includes only a minority of patients. Myelography remains the test of choice. MRI will play an increasingly important role in the future, but has not yet been systematically evaluated. The best therapeutic approach is not clear, but standard treatment is only about 50% effective in all cases. At present, radiation therapy is the treatment of choice for many patients, in particular those who are ambulatory at diagnosis. Anterior resection with vertebral body reconstruction is an exciting approach and may substantially improve the prognosis for patients who are paraparetic or paraplegic. It is important to attempt to choose for each patient the diagnostic and therapeutic options offering the best chance for comfort and preservation of function. The decision of how or even whether to treat is multifactorial and is more complicated than the determination of simply whether or not compression is present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,2899504,0,A case of active acromegaly with reduced height and type 1 renal tubular acidosis.,"A 41-year-old man with acromegaly was suffering from chronic, progressive backache and aware of reduction in his body height. Endocrine studies revealed increased glucose non-suppressible serum growth hormone (GH) and serum prolactin (PRL). Pituitary microadenoma was detected by a computerized axial tomogram and subsequently resected by trans-sphenoidal adenomectomy. The tumor proved to be a mixed GH- and PRL-secreting adenoma by electron microscopy and immunoperoxidase staining. Concurrent investigation of backache and reduced height disclosed markedly reduced radiodensity of the spinal bones, bilateral nephrocalcinosis, and hypercalciuria, which were ascribed to renal tubular acidosis (RTA) demonstrated by reduced urinary excretion of acids and insufficient reduction of urinary pH following oral administration of ammonium chloride. From the analogy to certain endocrinopathies, it appears likely that enhanced calcium metabolism and resultant hypercalciuria due to excess GH and PRL have led to the development of RTA, which further enhanced calciuria. Such enhanced calcium metabolism and consequent hypercalicuria conceivably led to accelerated demineralization of the spine and resulted in the reduced height of this patient in his early forties."
CD008686,0,3375842,0,Skeletal involvement in hairy cell leukemia.,"The clinical and radiographic aspects of two patients with destructive bone lesions, complicating the course of hairy cell leukemia are presented. The findings are compared with those of 27 previously published cases. The most prominent features of this rare skeletal disorder are osteolysis and widespread or localized demineralisation with predilection for the femoral head and neck. Localized persisting pain is the leading clinical symptom in all cases. Magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in evaluating the extent of bone marrow infiltration and demonstrates focal areas of decreased signal intensity in sites of radiographically detectable bone destruction as well as in bones that appear normal on plain films."
CD008686,0,3353077,0,Multiple myeloma presenting with spinal cord compression.,"The clinical features, treatment, and course of 6 patients with multiple myeloma, who presented initially with spinal cord compression, are reviewed. These 6 represent 12% of all patients with myeloma seen at our institution since 1979. Eighty-three similar patients were identified from the medical literature. There are no patient characteristics predictive for this presentation. A higher than expected proportion of patents have clinically localized disease, but progression to myelomatosis is common. As these patients present without a known diagnosis of malignancy, a prompt, invasive diagnostic procedure and the immediate institution of definitive local therapy is mandatory. Despite such an aggressive approach, the prospect for significant return of neurologic function is poor. Survival does not appear to be different from that of other patients with myeloma. Unlike other malignancies, a presentation with cord compression is not inconsistent with long-term survival, although significant morbidity secondary to the resultant functional disability can be expected."
CD008686,0,3335887,0,Clinical usefulness of an algorithm for the early diagnosis of spinal metastatic disease.,"We have previously reported an algorithm that invokes several imaging modalities in the early detection of metastatic and benign disease of the spine in patients with cancer (J Clin Oncol 4:576, 1986). The development of new lesions (shown by Tc99m bone scans) in cancer patients with normal neurological examinations is further evaluated with plain radiographs, spinal computed tomography (CT), and CT myelography (CT-M). Of 60 patients in the original study, 28% were diagnosed as having only benign disease and the remainder had spinal metastases. Thecal sac impingement was seen in 47% of patients with metastatic disease and disruption of the posterior vertebral cortex was noted in all patients with epidural compression. We now report the 2-year follow-up of 55 of these patients. Without treatment, the 17 patients diagnosed with benign disease have shown no evidence of local failure in the spine and median survival is greater than 27 months. Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with spinal metastases had a median survival time of 16.9 months. Radiation therapy directed by CT-M findings provided pain relief in 78% of patients with back pain and metastatic disease. No patient, including 19 with thecal sac impingement, developed clinical myelopathy. These results demonstrate the usefulness of an imaging algorithm for the early identification and distinction of spinal metastatic disease and benign disease in patients with cancer."

CD008686,0,3133944,0,Efficacy of buserelin in advanced prostate cancer and comparison with historical controls.,"Buserelin (B) is a synthetic nonapeptide analogue of native LHRH. Upon continued administration it reliably lowers the serum testosterone level to less than 100 ng/dl. It has been used in a clinical trial for the treatment of patients with stage C, D1, and D2 prostate cancer. Analysis of efficacy of testosterone suppression and toxicity included all 207 buserelin-treated patients. A comparison with historical controls from two National Prostate Cancer Project (NPCP) studies considered only the 147 evaluable patients with distant metastases (stage D2). All patients received buserelin, 500 micrograms q 8 hours subcutaneously (s.c.) for the first 7 days and then elected to take 200 micrograms s.c. daily or 400 micrograms q 8 hours by the intranasal (i.n.) route. Seventy-three percent elected s.c. administration. Only 2% changed the route of administration. The serum testosterone (T) level increased during week 1 in both the s.c. (426 ng/dl) and the i.n. (521 ng/dl) group but reached castrate (less than 100 mg/dl) levels by 4 weeks in 90% of patients. Subsequently, the likelihood of having a T level greater than 100 was higher for those treated by the i.n. than the s.c. route. The mean T level 4 and 12 months after therapy for the s.c. treated patients was 29 and 28. These values were 61 and 53 for those taking i.n. buserelin. This difference may in part be due to poor compliance. Toxicity was minor. Twelve percent of 151 s.c. treated patients had at least one episode of reaction at the injection site. None required discontinuation of the agent. Seventy-two percent experienced hot flushes; this was the same for both the s.c. and i.n. groups. Only 2 of 207 patients had a severe exacerbation of symptoms (spinal cord compression) during the first week of therapy. The criteria for response to therapy were those of the NPCP. There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients achieving a response when comparing the B-treated D2 patients to the NPCP D2 patients treated with DES, 3 mg daily, or orchiectomy. More of the B-treated patients entered with pain, a poor performance status, and weight loss than the DES/orchiectomy group. Nonetheless, the progression-free survival did not differ among the treatments. In summary, buserelin reliably lowers the serum T level by week 4 in 95% of men. Treatment efficacy is equivalent to a historical group treated with either DES or orchiectomy."

An analysis of long-term results in 87 children].,"52 patients were followed up out of a total of 87 children with sacrococcygeal teratomas, within a period of 25 years, from three paediatric surgery hospitals and out of altogether 73 survivors. The results in 35 children where the operation had been performed more than three years ago, were classified as ""late results"". From this group, 18 children were followed up by clinical examination only, without detecting any dysfunctions. By the additional use of electromanometry of urinary bladder and rectum, however, bladder and rectum dysfunctions were seen in about 40% of 17 further children. These dysfunctions were partly myogenic and partly neurogenic in nature and were directly related to the size, tumour status and intrapelvic extension of the sacrococcygeal teratoma."

A new association.,"The nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn (NSJ) syndrome is a not uncommon pediatric dermatosis, with malignant potential. It is the cutaneous manifestation of another phakomatosis, characterized by neurologic, ophthalmic, cardiovascular, skeletal, and urogenital involvement. The features of this syndrome overlap those of the oculo-auriculo-vertebral dysplasia of Goldenhar and tuberous sclerosis. The extent of system involvement suggests a developmental insult during the first few weeks of gestation. A clearly genetic basis has not been established. An infant with NSJ syndrome is described who had associated optic nerve hypoplasia. His clinical, pathologic, and radiologic findings, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, are presented."
CD008686,0,3696401,0,Use of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of metastatic spinal disease.,"Spinal metastases are present in up to 10% of all cancer patients at some time during the course of their disease. Pain is the most common presenting symptom, and neurological function is usually normal at this early stage. The clinical challenge is to detect and treat the spinal disease before the onset of neurological compromise. Myelography has been the standard test for identification of epidural metastases, but the invasive nature of myelography carries inherent risk and produces patient discomfort. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been useful in the evaluation of other spinal diseases, is noninvasive, and is tolerated well by patients. We evaluated and compared MRI (64 studies in 58 patients) to conventional studies (myelography, computed tomography, bone scanning, plain films) and determined its accuracy in diagnosis and efficacy in clinical decision making. MRI proved superior in detecting bone and epidural involvement by tumor and was valuable in clinical decision making. In addition, MRI provided better visualization of paravertebral soft tissue involvement by tumor. MRI is recommended as the initial study in patients with suspected metastatic spinal disease."
CD008686,0,3681371,0,Hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism following cytotoxic therapy for central nervous system malignancies.,"Endocrinologic dysfunction including hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism are recognized complications of irradiation to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis or thyroid gland in the course of treating CNS malignancies. However, the frequency of these adverse effects in both short- and long-term survivors may be underestimated. Sixty-five patients treated in the University of Rochester Cancer Center since 1968 with radiation with or without BCNU chemotherapy for CNS tumors not involving the hypothalamic-pituitary axis were evaluated for thyroid, prolactin, and gonadal disturbances regardless of clinical symptomatology. Prolactin values were elevated in 19 of 47 patients (40%). For males and females treated with greater than 55 Gy, abnormal values were present in nine of 11 (82%) and seven of 14 (50%), respectively. For males and females treated with less than or equal to 55 Gy, two of nine (22%) and one of 13 (8%), respectively, were abnormal (P = .0001). Six of six patients who also received BCNU chemotherapy were hyperprolactinemic, as compared with six of ten (60%) who did not receive BCNU. Seven of eight females with elevated prolactin levels had menstruation abnormalities, and five of seven adult males noted a decrease in libido. Mild abnormalities in testosterone concentration were found in three of nine men evaluated, all of whom had normal gonadotropins. Of 47 patients who did not receive irradiation to the spinal axis (and thus the thyroid gland), ten (21%) had a decreased thyroxin (T4) value. Only one of these patients had an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) value. Of 32 patients who received greater than 55 Gy, ten (31%) had a low T4, compared with zero of 15 who received less than or equal to 55 Gy (P = .0001). Four of eight patients (50%) who also received BCNU had low T4 values, as compared with three of 14 (21%) who did not receive BCNU. Of 15 patients who were treated with 4 to 10 MV photon irradiation to the spinal axis, five patients (33%) had elevated TSH values. The mean spinal axis dose in these patients was 33 Gy. Two euthyroid children in this group manifested the early onset of puberty. The complex of endocrinologic abnormalities observed in several patients receiving only cranial irradiation, that is elevated prolactin, decreased thyroid, and gonadal hormone secretion in the presence of otherwise normal pituitary hormone levels, suggests a radiation-induced insult to the hypothalamic regulation of pituitary function."
CD008686,0,3674088,0,Human immunodeficiency virus-associated meningitis. Clinical course and correlations.,"Fourteen patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had a lymphocytic pleocytosis unexplained by secondary pathogens or neoplasms. Three men had prior diagnoses of Kaposi's sarcoma; none had acquired immune deficiency syndrome-defining opportunistic infections. Two patterns of illness were observed. Seven men had an acute, self-limited illness that was often accompanied by meningeal findings. The other seven had chronic headaches without signs of meningeal irritation and had less marked abnormalities of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count and protein. Encephalopathy was a finding in only one of 14 patients. In four of five CSF specimens studied, HIV was recovered. HIV has been associated with acute meningitis at the time of seroconversion and can apparently also cause sporadic episodes of acute or chronic meningitis in patients with prior infection and relatively preserved immune function. Both the clinical presentation with predominant headache rather than encephalopathy and the presence of CSF inflammation differentiate this syndrome from other HIV-related neurologic complications."
CD008686,0,3425485,0,Spinal cord meningiomas in the elderly.,"The clinical features of six women with spinal cord meningioma are presented. These cases comprise the neurosurgical experience of one of the authors (B.B.) over approximately a 3-year period. Median age was 76 years with a range of 65-89 years. Previous reports of this disorder have not emphasized the occurrence of this tumour in the later decades. A notable feature was delay in diagnosis. Only one patient had a correct diagnosis of spinal cord compression prior to admission. Incorrect diagnoses included diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, degenerative spinal disease, gait disturbance secondary to fall and a thalamic cerebrovascular accident. Gait disorders at presentation included paraparesis, wide-based gait and unclassified disability. All patients had pyramidal tract signs and five had a truncal sensory level. Plain radiographs of the spine were unhelpful and can dissuade the physician from the diagnosis. All tumours were in the thoracic region. Surgery resulted in cure in all patients and diverted one patient from planned institutional care. Spinal cord meningioma should be considered in elderly patients presenting with gait disorder."
CD008686,0,2830955,0,Neurologic disorders in patients with small cell lung cancer.,"In a series of 641 patients with small cell lung cancer, 189 (29.5%) had at least one neurologic disorder either at the time of presentation or during the subsequent clinical course of the cancer. The total number of neurologic disorders was 210, which included brain metastases (75.7%), meningeal carcinomatosis (6.7%), intramedullary metastases (2.4%), epidural metastases (11.0%), hyponatremia producing CNS symptoms (3.3%), and Eaton-Lambert syndrome (1.0%). The most common signs and symptoms were motor dysfunction and confusion. The overall survival of patients with any neurologic disorder was compared to that of patients without neurologic problems. There was no difference between the survival curves for the first year and a half, but patients without neurologic complications had a greater probability of long-term survival (log-rank P = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences when this comparison was made according to stage of disease. When a neurologic disorder related to cancer occurred, the survival time from the date of that diagnosis was usually short. The neurologic disorder was the immediate cause of death in the majority of cases. In patients who achieved a complete remission, the administration of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) significantly reduced the risk of developing brain metastases as the initial site of the relapse (log-rank P = 0.0034). After adjustment for performance status and extent of disease, the survival of complete responders treated with and without PCI was not significantly different. We conclude that neurologic complications are a frequent and serious problem in patients with SCLC."
CD008686,0,3678792,0,[Presacral malignant schwannoma].,"In a woman patient who was 69 years of age and who was free from complaints and symptoms we identified a cystic solid and partly calcified tumour of 11 X 9 X 7 cm size in the lower abdomen, as well as two circular pulmonary foci that were suspected of being malignant. Clinical, sonographical and radiological findings led to the suspected diagnosis of a pulmonary metastasizing ovarian carcinoma. However, laparotomy revealed that the tumour site was presacral and retroperitoneal. The tumour was extirpated, and the histological diagnosis was that of a malignant schwannoma. No radiotherapy or chemotherapy was initiated because of the slender changes of success and the considerable side effects. Clinical pattern, problems of diagnosis and the prognosis of these rare malignomas are discussed."
CD008686,0,3655863,0,Comparison of spinal magnetic resonance imaging and myelography in cancer patients.,"Spinal involvement by systemic malignancy is common, and often leads to extradural compression of the spinal cord and/or nerve roots by metastases. Rapid, anatomically accurate diagnosis is essential to the successful management of these patients. We compared spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with conventional myelography in a series of 31 cancer patients being evaluated for myelopathy (N = 10), or back/radicular pain (N = 21). All patients were evaluated between April 1985 and July 1986, and underwent both studies within ten days of each other (median, two days). MRI was performed on a 0.5 Tesla Technicare unit with a body surface coil, and results compared with standard contrast myelography. All studies were reviewed separately and in a ""blinded"" fashion. MRI and myelography were comparable in detecting large lesions that produced complete subarachnoid block (five of ten patients with myelopathy, three of twenty-one patients with back/radicular pain). In 19 of 31 patients, smaller but clinically significant extradural lesions were found. In nine of 19 cases, these lesions were demonstrated equally well by both modalities; in nine of 19 cases, these lesions were demonstrated by myelography alone; in one of 19, a lesion was demonstrated by MRI alone. Given our current technology, myelography appeared superior to MRI as a single imaging modality. However, MRI may be an alternative in patients where total myelography is technically impossible or unusually hazardous."
CD008686,0,3478002,0,"[A case of Ewing's sarcoma treated successfully by combination chemotherapy consisting of high-dose methotrexate, aclacinomycin-A and vindesine].","A 22-year-old man was admitted to Kyushu University Hospital because of high fever, and pain in the right foot and back. An X-ray examination revealed an osteolytic lesion on the 5th metatarsal bone of the right foot. Paraplegia and disturbance of bladder function occurred and compression of the spinal cord between T3 and L5 was found by myelography. An extradural tumor was removed by emergent laminectomy, and a histological examination of the tumor showed aggregations of small round cells, which suggested Ewing's sarcoma. Although T-9 protocol was started with initial effect, the tumor recurred during the therapy. The patient was then treated with HD-MTX, ACR and VDS, which induced a clinical improvement for 4 months without maintenance therapy. This result showed that HD-MTX, ACR and VDS warrant further consideration for the treatment of refractory Ewing's sarcoma."
CD008686,0,3309202,0,Intra-axial tumors of the cervicomedullary junction.,The authors present their experience with the operative management of 20 intra-axial tumors of the cervicomedullary junction. There were two distinct modes of clinical presentation: lower cranial nerve dysfunction and spinal cord dysfunction. Both groups of patients had indolent courses: in 75% of the patients the symptoms had been present for 6 months to 2 years. Radical excision was carried out in all patients. There was no surgical mortality. Postoperative neurological recovery was directly related to the preoperative status; one patient had a significant new deficit. The authors conclude that intrinsic gliomas of the cervicomedullary junction are amenable to radical excision and that an aggressive surgical approach offers the potential for both neurological recovery and long-term survival. The neuroradiological evaluation and operative technique are discussed.
CD008686,0,3631768,0,Claudication as a rare symptom of recurrent cervical carcinoma.,Diagnosis of recurrent cervical cancer can be very difficult in the heavily irradiated pelvis. Sciatica and lymphedema are well-known symptoms of disease recurrent to the side wall. The isolated symptom of claudication is reported as an early sign of recurrence. Two patients are presented in whom claudication was the only early presenting symptom. This symptom in a patient with a history of a gynecologic malignancy should lead to an evaluation for recurrent cancer as well as the routine vascular studies.
CD008686,0,3614614,0,Sciatica: an early manifestation of thoracic vertebral osteochondroma.,"We describe a 36-year-old woman with a thoracic vertebral osteochondroma who presented with radicular leg pain. This benign tumor is uncommon in the vertebral column, and radicular pain is an unusual manifestation of a thoracic spinal lesion. Myelography and computed tomography aided in diagnosis; surgical resection resulted in an excellent clinical response."
CD008686,0,3597143,0,Prostatic carcinoma: limited field irradiation.,"This is a retrospective study of 251 patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma treated primarily with limited field radiotherapy techniques, under the principle direction of authors JMV and JPG, between 1968 and 1981 in San Francisco, California. All patients are followed for a minimum of 3 years; mean follow-up is 7.3 years. Routine clinical staging procedures included: H&P, digital prostate exam, cystoscopy, biopsy, blood studies including serum acid phosphatase, and imaging studies including chest X ray, IVP, bone survey or radionucleotide bone scan, and in recent years, pelvic CT scans. Twelve patients are Stage A1, 37-Stage A2, 50-Stage B, 140-Stage C1 and 12-Stage C2. Ninety percent of all cases and 85% of Stage C patients were treated with limited fields to the prostate and periprostatic volume only. Total doses were prescribed at midplane or isocenter and were generally 6500-7000 cGy, daily doses of 180-200 cGy, 5 days per week. Actuarial 5- and 10-year survival rates are: entire population-69% and 47%; Stage A1-74% and 50%; Stage A2-81% and 67%; Stage B-84% and 53%; Stage C1-63% and 42%; Stage C2-32% and 11%. The 5- and 10-year disease-free actuarial survivals are: entire population-71% and 50%; Stage A1-89% and 74%; Stage A2-82% and 69%; Stage B-71% and 52%; Stage C1-67% and 44%; Stage C2-0%. Sites of recurrence, alone or as a component of the failure pattern are: 37 (15%) local, 11 (4%) symptomatic regional recurrence (lower extremity edema, pelvic pain/sciatica, hydroureteronephrosis), and 87 (35%) distant metastasis. Seven (3%) had unknown sites of failure. Local-regional failure occurred in 42% of Stage C2 patients. Concomitant hormonal therapy has no survival impact on Stage C1 patients and poorly differentiated histology is associated with decreased determinate and disease-free survival rate of 5 years. Complications correlate with treatment technique, being more frequent with single field per day treatment plans. In patients treated with multiple fields per day or rotational plans, complications occur in less than 8% of patients and major complications have not occurred."
CD008686,0,3579664,0,Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis. Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.,"The diagnosis of intramedullary spinal cord metastasis (ISM) is difficult, and treatment is usually ineffective. We review our own experience with ISM as well as the pertinent medical literature, and suggest a practical diagnostic and therapeutic approach. The problem of the diagnosis of ISM is essentially that of the differential diagnosis of a noncompressive myelopathy in a patient with systemic cancer. Most such patients prove to have ISM, meningeal carcinomatosis, radiation myelopathy, or paraneoplastic necrotizing myelopathy. Neurologic features of value in this differential diagnosis are pain, the tempo and mode of progression of symptoms, and tumor cells in the spinal fluid. Oncologic features of value are the location of the primary tumor, the past exposure to therapeutic radiation, cerebral metastases, and the extent of systemic metastatic disease. The myelogram in ISM is either normal or nonspecifically abnormal; therefore, the diagnosis must be made on clinical grounds. Although no single finding is diagnostic of ISM, a careful clinical analysis will lead to the correct diagnosis in most cases. Radiation therapy is effective treatment for ISM, but only if it is administered early, before paraplegia supervenes. Thus, the diagnosis should be made and treatment begun as soon as possible. Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis is often multifocal rather than solitary; therefore, whole-cord rather than local spinal radiation should be given, if possible. If local radiotherapy is chosen, the construction of the portal can be based on the myelogram or, in the event of a normal study, on the clinical localization of the tumor."
CD008686,0,3035997,0,Disorders of the autonomic nervous system: Part 1. Pathophysiology and clinical features.,"Autonomic dysfunction may result from diseases that affect primarily either the central nervous system or the peripheral autonomic nervous system. The most common pathogenesis of disturbed autonomic function in central nervous system diseases is degeneration of the intermediolateral cell columns (progressive autonomic failure) or disease or damage to descending pathways that synapse on the intermediolateral column cells (spinal cord lesions, cerebrovascular disease, brainstem tumors, multiple sclerosis). The peripheral autonomic nervous system may be damaged in isolation in the acute and subacute autonomic neuropathies or in association with a generalized peripheral neuropathy. The peripheral neuropathies most likely to cause severe autonomic disturbance are those in which small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers are damaged in the baroreflex afferents, the vagal efferents to the heart, and the sympathetic efferent pathways to the mesenteric vascular bed. Acute demyelination of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in the Guillain-Barré syndrome may also cause acute autonomic dysfunction. Although autonomic disturbances may occur in other types of peripheral neuropathy, they are rarely clinically important."
CD008686,0,2886967,0,The McGill Pain Questionnaire--German version. A study on cancer pain.,"The McGill Pain Questionnaire, widely used in English-speaking countries, has been translated into German. The objective in translating the questionnaire was to produce a translation of the words while keeping the expression of the pain quality and intensity. The results of our present study with a German-speaking cancer pain population, concerning the choice of words and pain rating values, are comparable with those of similar English-speaking patients. The superiority of this multidimensional verbal questionnaire in analysis of pain qualities over unidimensional pain intensity scales was proved. The therapeutic effect of peridural opiate analgesia was measured in 30 patients with intractable cancer pain after they had completed the questionnaire. After 5 days of therapy, there was an average of 70% relief of the total pain experience, with best results obtained in patients with bone pain in the lumbo-sacral region."
CD008686,0,2437869,0,Pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Options for curative resection.,"Pelvic recurrence is an ominous event after curative resection of rectal cancer and is rarely amenable to re-resection by conventional methods. A method to permit a composite resection of these using the abdominal sacral approach has been described previously. This report updates that experience with resection of pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer in 28 patients. Of these, 24 were done with curative intent, and four were done for palliation (mainly for infected or fungating tumor). All patients had extensive preoperative evaluation by clinical and radiologic tests, and most patients had a long free interval period of approximately 18 months, after their primary resection. Although 47 patients had exploratory surgery, only 29 had local disease amenable to resection and four had palliative resections. About half the patients had had an abdominoperineal resection, half had had an anterior resection, and one third had had previous efforts to resect the recurrence. All but one patient had been irradiated with 3000-11,000 cGy. All but two patients (of the 24 curative efforts) required a formal abdominosacral resection (through S1-2 in 12, S2-3 in 9, and S4-5 in 1). Over half the patients also required a bladder resection. There were three operative deaths (12%); one patient had a cardiac death immediately after operation and two were septic deaths at 35 and 60 days. The survivors generally had relief of sacral root pain and good motor function; most of those previously employed could return to work. The actuarial 5-year survival rate is 25% and median survival is 36 months. Long-term survival over 48 months was recorded in five of 21 surgical survivors (23.8%). Survival in a historic comparative group of 30 patients treated for local recurrence only (mainly by radiation) was 15 months median, and at 5 years the survival rate was 3% (p less than 0.001). In conclusion, selected patients with pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer may be retrieved by and returned to functional life with the composite abdominosacral resection."
CD008686,0,2484446,0,From hospital to hospice and back again: the management of chronic cancer pain.,"The National Hospice Study of 1986 has not only revealed that hospices do a better job of meeting pain-control goals than do hospitals, but also elucidated a number of important differences in hospice and hospital care that account for this finding."
CD008686,0,3555919,0,Soft tissue and pelvic dystocia.,"This article has considered the subject of bony pelvic dystocia and soft tissue dystocia. Dystocia most often results from a combination of fetal and pelvic factors. However, on many occasions the size and shape of the pelvis is the initial problem, which encourages the fetus to take up a malposition such as occiput-posterior, and this in turn results in a dysfunctional contraction pattern that may or may not be corrected by oxytocin augmentation--a vicious circle that can only be broken by performance of a cesarean section. With minor degrees of pelvic dystocia, asynclitism and molding of the fetal head can often make a safe vaginal delivery possible. Clinically all pelvises can be categorized into adequate, questionable, and too small. The latter group is the least common and generally includes the congenitally or developmentally abnormal pelvises, and in most cases primary cesarean section should be the mode of delivery. In all other pelvises with a vertex presentation, a trial of labor is indicated because the fetal head is an excellent pelvimeter. With proper fetal monitoring with an intrauterine pressure catheter, with the use of a partograph to assist in the diagnosis of an active-phase arrest, followed by a cesarean section at the appropriate time, there is no increase in fetal or maternal morbidity. If the breech is the presenting part, then there are only two types of pelvis--very adequate and inadequate--and x-ray pelvimetry should be used to help in the classification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,3309900,0,[A case of neurogenic bladder caused by spinal cord traction in childhood. Diagnostic and therapeutic aspects].,"The diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of a pediatric case of tethered cord syndrome are described. The urological symptoms were of primary importance; bladder dysfunction was confirmed urodynamically; voiding cystourethrography showed trabeculation and elongation of bladder with distal sphincter obstruction and left vesicoureteral reflux. The bladder dysfunction was managed satisfactorily with pharmacological therapy and clean intermittent self-catheterization. Nuclear magnetic resonance demonstrated a tethered spinal cord with lipoma of cauda equina. The importance of neuroradiology is emphasized in order to establish an early and precise diagnosis. Early neurosurgery is justified by the need to avoid any progressive and severe lower extremity deficit and by the high frequency of urological improvement in cases treated with spinal operation. However, in this case, clinical and pathological findings suggested to defer any surgical intervention."
CD008686,0,2950289,0,Back pain and epidural spinal cord compression.,"Back pain, one of man's most common afflictions, can be caused by a wide variety of disorders ranging from exercise-induced lumbar strain to spinal cord compression by metastatic tumor. A rational approach to the diagnosis and management of the patient with back pain allows the physician to treat self-limited disorders without excessive workup while identifying those patients with malignant disease sufficiently early to prevent permanent neurological damage."
CD008686,0,3548343,0,"Bone metastases: pathogenesis, treatment, and rationale for use of resorption inhibitors.","Tumors in bone are usually metastatic, with breast, prostate, and lung tumors accounting for more than 80 percent of clinically manifest lesions. Untreated, such metastases can produce the symptoms that most concern cancer patients--pain, pathologic fractures, and paralysis through epidural cord compression. Recent advances in the understanding of the metastatic cascade and the regulation of bone formation and resorption provide unique therapeutic approaches for prevention and treatment of these lesions. This article reviews the prevalence, distribution, diagnosis, and treatment of metastatic cancer in the skeleton, as well as the processes involved in the development of such metastases, the local mediators responsible for some of the destructive changes in bone, and their pathologic results. In addition to considering some of the conventional therapeutic approaches, a rationale for the use of bone resorption inhibitors, such as the diphosphonates (bisphosphonates), is presented for the prevention and amelioration of the pathologic consequences of skeletal metastases."
CD008686,0,3828149,0,[Pathogenesis and the treatment of secondary syringomyelia].,"Six cases with secondary syringomyelia were evaluated clinically and the pathogenesis was discussed. Three cases had the tumors; an ependymoma arising from the conus medullaris and the filum terminale, a foramen magnum meningioma extending to C2 and a thoracic astrocytoma. Two cases had past history of spinal cord injury with L1 and L2 fracture-dislocation, respectively. One case showed hydromyelic symptoms associated with isolated fourth ventricle after post-meningitic hydrocephalus. Clinical symptoms and signs were complex and various in each case due to the association of the original disease and the syrinx. Syringomyelic symptoms were dominant in three cases of which the syrinx extended from the conus to the cervical cord. Initial symptoms of two cases with post-traumatic syringomyelia were tingling pains which began near the site of injury and extended rostrally. Metrizamide myelography revealed complete or incomplete block at the location of the tumors or the injuries. Delayed CT demonstrated the syrinx in all cases. The syrinx was always present near the sites of primary lesions. The communication between the syrinx and the fourth ventricle was suspected in three cases, and the communication of the syrinx and the spinal subarachnoid space was suspected in two cases. All cases underwent the surgical treatments. Total removal of the tumors were completed in two cases and relieved the majority of symptoms. On the other hand, a case with a thoracic astrocytoma underwent biopsy of the tumor and irradiation, followed by poor outcome. Syringo-peritoneal shunts were performed in two cases with post-traumatic syringomyelia and relieved pain, but neurological signs were unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,3810440,0,Spinal cord compression in Paget's disease of bone with reference to sarcomatous degeneration and calcitonin treatment.,"Four cases of spinal cord compression stemming from Paget's disease of bone tissue are reported. Sarcomatous degeneration was proved in one case and in another one malignancy was deduced by computed tomography (CT) scanning. Clinical and radiologic manifestations as well as surgical management are discussed. The value of CT scanning of the spine as an aid in the evaluation of structural changes and the size of the soft tissue mass in sarcomatous degeneration of the lesion is stressed. After calcitonin administration, alleviation of pain and improvement in neurological status have occurred in two treated patients."
CD008686,0,3801852,0,Alloaesthesia.,"Alloaesthesia is a condition in which a sensory stimulus given on one side of the body is perceived at the corresponding area on the other side. We observed this in 20 out of 123 patients with hypertensive cerebral haemorrhage in the acute stage (within twenty days), all except 1 in the right hemisphere. This phenomenon was observed in 17 out of 35 patients with right putaminal haemorrhage and only 1 out of 30 patients with right thalamic haemorrhage, suggesting it may be useful in differentiating putaminal from thalamic haemorrhage in the right hemisphere. Three patients, with cervical tumour, cervical disc herniation and multiple sclerosis also showed alloaethesia. They had anterolateral lesions of the spinal cord. The cerebral and spinal cord lesions presented similar symptomatic characteristics of alloaesthesia. It is suggested that as alloaesthesia is produced by noxious stimuli not only in spinal cord but also in cerebral lesions it may represent an elementary sensory disturbance of sensory pathways, and not a higher cortical dysfunction."
CD008686,0,3561681,0,[Report on successful surgery of cavernous angioma in the dorsal part of the pons--usefulness of MRI in diagnosis].,"A case with cavernous angioma which was located in the dorsal of the pons was cured surgically. A 16-year-old male was admitted with complaints of right motor and sensory disturbance. On neurological examination, the patient had right hemiparesis and hemiparesthesia, and right cerebellar signs. X-ray CT scan demonstrated a high density mass in the pons. Carotid and vertebral angiograms showed no abnormality. T1 and T2 weighted MRI clarified the pontine mass not as a tumor but a hematoma. Then, from the age of the patient, his clinical course, follow up X-ray CT and MRI findings, it was considered that a pontine lesion must have been an angioma with hemorrhage. Therefore, the operation was performed in an attempt to removal the hematoma and the mass of abnormal vessels in the dorsal part of the pons. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed abnormal vessels as a cavernous angioma. The postoperative course was uneventful."

CD008686,0,3787439,0,Short latency somatosensory-evoked potentials in children--Part 2. Effects of spinovertebral disorders.,"Surface-recorded spinal and cortical somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) following tibial or median nerve stimulation were studied in 26 children aged from 12 months to 13 years. Fifteen patients had caudal or dysraphic spinal malformations, often with a tethered cord syndrome, while the remaining patients had spinal tumors (4), syringomyelia (3), spinal canal stenosis (2), or demyelinating syndromes (2). Somatosensory-evoked potential abnormalities were found in 13 patients. Loss of a SEP at or rostral to the site of spinal pathology was the most common finding. Prolongation of central conduction times or delay in SEP peak latencies was documented in only four patients. Correlations between clinical and electrophysiological findings revealed that all patients with sensory dysfunction had abnormal SEPs, whereas patients with motor or sphincteric dysfunction, but intact sensation, usually had normal SEPs. These relationships between SEPs and clinical findings were constant irrespective of the etiology and location of the spinal pathology. The results from this study suggest that although SEP studies provide information regarding the somatosensory pathways, their clinical utility as a method of assessing spinal cord function in children with spinal disorders is limited by technical, clinical, and anatomical factors."
CD008686,0,3695494,0,Androgen depletion and repletion as a means of potentiating the effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy in advanced prostate cancer.,"Seventy-five patients with stage D-2 prostate cancer refractory to orchiectomy have been entered in a controlled trial to test whether androgen priming enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy. All patients are treated with aminoglutethimide and hydrocortisone as a means of achieving medical adrenalectomy and are given cyclic i.v. chemotherapy with cytoxan, adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil. Patients in the stimulation arm (N = 39) receive, in addition, fluoxymesterone (5 mg p.o. b.i.d.) for 3 days before and on the day of chemotherapy. A similar response rate was observed in the stimulation and control arm (83% vs 74% respectively) when the analysis was restricted to evaluable patients. When all patients were included, a significantly higher response rate was observed in the control arm (64% vs 49%, P less than 0.05) as a result of the larger fraction of unevaluable patients in the stimulation arm (41% vs 14%). Median duration of response is 9 months in the stimulation and 10 months in the control arm. Median overall survival in the stimulation and control group is 12 months and 16 months respectively. Significant toxicity consisting of exacerbation of bone pain and, in two patients, development of reversible spinal cord compression was observed following androgen priming. Our results suggest that combined medical adrenalectomy and chemotherapy are highly effective in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Thus far, no additional benefit has been observed with androgen priming."

The lung biopsy revealed multiple tumor emboli by an enigmatic epithelioid-appearing neoplasm with immunohistochemical staining for vimentin, cytokeratin, and epithelial membrane antigen. A thorough roentgenographic evaluation disclosed a destructive, prepontine mass in the region of the clivus, erosion of the odontoid process, and compression of the cervical spinal cord. The patient died after a clinical course of 3 months. We identified 16 additional cases of metastasizing chordomas in the pediatric-age population; this case is the first to our knowledge with pathologically documented pulmonary metastasis at presentation."

A myelo C.T. revealed a spinal epidural dumb bell-shaped mass extending in the intra and extra vertebral spaces through the enlarged intervertebral foramen. Total recovery was observed three months after surgery. Pathological examination of the tumor showed it to be a cavernous angioma. Primary epidural angioma is rare: in 2 reported dumb bell-shaped spinal epidural cavernous angiomas, radiological findings were also suggesting a spinal neurinoma."

There are 8 previously described patients with similar clinical and laboratory data, suggesting a biologically unique subset of ALL. Characteristic findings of this rare primary manifestation of leukemia are lack of significant organomegaly or lymphadenopathy, normal or low white blood cell count with predominance of lymphocytes and rarely circulating lymphoblasts, normal platelet count, uric acid and lactate dehydrogenase values. In the following report we make a further attempt to confirm the hypothesis of a subset of ALL, demonstrating two additional patients with characteristic features of ALL presenting with vertebral changes and low leukemic burden."
CD008686,0,3331379,0,Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging in oncology.,"MRI is synonymous with proton imaging. It provides detailed images of gross anatomy and pathology owing to the excellent soft-tissue contrast, signal void of flowing blood, versatile geometry, and freedom from streak artifacts, as well as other advantages summarized in Table 8-2. In the CNS, MRI has emerged as the most sensitive imaging modality in virtually all pathologies--some reservations remaining concerning acute hemorrhage, focal calcifications, and bone detail. Hence, it should be considered the premier noninvasive examination in the evaluation of the cancer patient with any suspicion of CNS pathology. Economics and availability must, of course, be considered when evaluating MR's role relative to CT. MR clearly provides the best means of excluding pathology, particularly in the posterior fossa, and must be considered after a negative CT examination with persistent clinical suspicions. MRI must also be considered in routine surveillance, if the earliest possible detection of metastasis, demyelination, and other pathologies is to be achieved. MRI should be considered in the evaluation of vertebral metastases, spinal cord compression, and back pain because of its ability to depict CSF, spinal cord, disk, and vertebral body as distinct structures and its sensitivity to marrow disease. In the extremities and pelvis, clearer depiction of soft tissues, vessels, and marrow is a proven advantage. Hence, MRI is indicated in the evaluation of prostate/bladder/rectal carcinoma, uterine/cervical carcinoma, soft tissues/bony sarcomas, and bone metastasis/infarction. In the abdomen, MRI's display of the retroperitoneum and sensitivity to liver lesions indicates its use in the evaluation and staging of renal/adrenal carcinoma, retroperitoneal sarcomas, primary liver tumors, and metastases. Moreover, MRI is also indicated in the evaluation of liver or adrenal masses of uncertain histology owing to a limited specificity of the MR signal for adenoma, carcinoma, and hemangioma. In the chest, MRI's advantages are currently limited owing to the excellent quality of CT images of mediastinum and lung parenchyma and the deleterious effects of respiratory motion. MRI's primary indications in the chest are for the distinction of mediastinal and hilar masses from vessels and aneurysms; evaluation of lumenal patency and superior vena cava syndrome; detection and display of pericardial effusion and the relationship of tumor to the pericardium; and evaluation of internal cardiac anatomy, thrombi, and tumor. Because of rapid technological advances, statements concerning MRI's limitations must be guarded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,3111160,0,Spinal neuroaxonal dystrophy and angioneuromatosis.,"A man of 75 years of age had had lightning pains in the legs for 8 years. Clinical examination demonstrated mild pyramidal signs and involvement of the posterior columns. A morphine pump was placed in the epidural space in the lumbar region to treat the pain. He died two weeks later from a massive pulmonary embolism. The nervous system was examined using the classical techniques along with the use of poly- and monoclonal antibodies against nervous system specific proteins. The following features were demonstrated: neuroaxonal dystrophy of the posterior and anterior horns, and the posterior columns and corticospinal pathways in decreasing order of importance; angioneuromatosis of the grey matter of the lumbosacral spinal cord and loss of neurons of the dorsal spinal root ganglia and bilateral degeneration of the fasciculus gracilis. Previously, we have only found such amounts of spheroids in the spinal cord as measured here in cases of Seitelberger's disease. The angioneuromatosis was isolated and did not result from previous trauma nor was it associated with a known phacomatosis. This combination of features is very unusual and may explain the clinical features including the lightning pains."
CD008686,0,3034113,0,[Neuropathy caused by cisplatin. 7 cases including one with an autopsy study].,"The clinical, electrophysiological and histopathological features in seven cases of cisplatinum peripheral neuropathy are reported and compared with the literature data. The neuropathy appears for an average intake of 500 mg/m2 of DDP. The symptoms are those of a symmetric, distal, predominantly sensitive neuropathy of an axonal type with major involvement of proprioception. Neurological improvement is poor after withdrawal of the drug. A post mortem study performed in one case showed a degeneration of the posterior column in the cord and residual nodules of Nageotte in a lumbar spinal ganglion. The systematic study of the tendon reflexes and distal pallesthesia in subjects treated with the drug, may reveal the neuropathy before the onset of the most disabling symptoms (paresthesia, ataxia, pain, Lhermitte's sign)."
CD008686,0,2855834,0,Measurement of flare responses in patients with pain.,"Pain is a sensory and emotional experience and, as such, is always subjective. However, for many patients pain results from stimulation of nociceptors in somatic structures. Polymodal nociceptors also mediate flare responses to noxious stimuli. In this study skin flare responses overlying the painful region in patients with pain from degenerative spine disease (16), cancer (12) and osteomyelitis (1) were examined, and compared with control areas in the same patients. Flares were induced with capsaicin (0.2 g/L in 70% ethanol) and the area was measured by planimeter after 30 minutes of exposure to the chemical. Patients with chronic pain had reduced flare responses over the pain site compared with control areas (p less than 0.1; Wilcoxon two-sample test). There was no difference between patients with acute on chronic pain and with chronic pain alone. Acute pain alone produced an increased flare response. The results suggest increased nociceptor activity in acute pain and reduced activity in chronic pain. This may reflect sensitisation and desensitisation of the nociceptor, as has been demonstrated in experimental studies in animals."
CD008686,0,2830867,0,[Multilocular cystic nephroma].,"The nephroma occurred in a 38-year-old woman, and its sole clinical manifestation was an aching pain in the lumbar region. Angiographic, macroscopic, and light- and electron-microscopic findings are presented. A special feature of the tumor was the presence of secretory granules in its epithelial cells. The possibility of prostaglandin synthesis by the tumor is discussed."

CD008686,0,3822060,0,[A case of male cystic pituitary adenoma with hyperprolactinemia--clinical study of 6 cases of male prolactinoma].,"A case of male cystic prolactinoma is reported. And six cases of male prolactinoma including the present case were experienced in our department, and they were studied clinically. A 40-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with complaints of decreased libido and bitemporal visual depression. Physical examination revealed neither gynecomastia nor galactorrhea. Decreased visual acuity, bitemporal hemianopia, and pale optic disc were disclosed. On endocrinological study, high serum level of prolactin and hyposecretion of the other pituitary hormones were shown. Plain skull x-ray films showed ballooning of the sella turcica. CT scan revealed a low density area in the pituitary fossa extending to the suprasellar region. This was visualized as a homogeneous high signal intensity in the T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical treatment was made by transsphenoidal approach. A considerable amount of dark reddish fluid was suctioned through an incision of the thinned dura mater. Postoperative course was uneventful, and the bitemporal hemianopia was much improved. The serum level of prolactin was normalized after administration of bromocriptine. Male prolactinomas were thought to constitute 20% of all prolactinomas and male cystic prolactinoma was a rare clinical entity. Since the serum level of prolactin became to be measured routinely, six male prolactinomas have been experienced in our department. Their clinical feature were summarized as follows; Mean age of the patients was 33.2 +/- 9.8 years. Marked suprasellar extension and associated visual disturbance were common. All lesions except in the present case were solid tumor. Mean serum level of prolactin was 3398.3 +/- 2758.4 ng/ml. Pituitary apoplexy during the test of insulin, TRH and LH-RH simultaneous loading was noted in two cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008686,0,3808231,0,Subarachnoid hemorrhage with normal cerebral angiography: a prospective study on sellar abnormalities and pituitary function.,"Ten consecutive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of unknown cause were examined for sellar abnormalities and pituitary dysfunction. The diagnosis of SAH rested on a typical history and the demonstration of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (computed tomography (CT), lumbar puncture). Initial CT and four-vessel angiography were performed in all patients, and five had repeat angiography. Endocrinological assessment was done after the initial angiography, and abnormal findings from this first study were reassessed 3 months later. The follow-up study included a high resolution CT scan of the sellar region. One patient had panhypopituitarism. Insufficient growth hormone secretion alone or combined with a low plasma concentration of estradiol or testosterone was found in another seven patients. The sella was ballooned or enlarged in three patients, and four patients had at follow-up a partly empty sella. A spontaneous development of a partly empty sella from an adenoma with suprasellar extension was observed in the patient with panhypopituitarism. This patient had experienced pituitary apoplexy with resulting SAH. Based on sellar enlargement, an empty sella, and pituitary dysfunction, this pathogenesis was suggested in another three patients. Our findings suggest that hemorrhagic necrosis in a pituitary adenoma may be an important cause of SAH with normal angiography."
CD008686,0,3022411,0,Imaging sacral nerve root cysts.,"Sacral nerve root cysts usually are an incidental finding but may be found in patients with a history of pain. On computed tomography they are demonstrated as a soft tissue mass, possibly with associated bony erosion. Demonstrating the fluid-filled nature of these masses is important in establishing the diagnosis. The imaging of these cysts in two patients, including magnetic resonance, is described."
CD008686,0,2949691,0,Early detection and treatment of spinal epidural metastases: the role of myelography.,"Spinal epidural metastases were detected in 75 of 140 cancer patients with back pain who were evaluated prospectively by clinical criteria, spine roentgenography, and bone scan. Fifty-five of the 75 patients with epidural metastases had no evidence of myelopathy when diagnosed. Of the patients diagnosed and treated while still ambulatory, more than 90% remained so. Myelograms were performed in 127 patients to diagnose the 75 with epidural disease. To try to reduce the number of myelograms needed, we attempted to design radiotherapy ports based on clinical symptoms and the plain spine films alone. A port could not be designed for 64 of the 127 patients, either because of diffuse vertebral metastases or a normal plain roentgenogram. A port could be designed for 63 patients, and all epidural disease would have been encompassed in 50 of the 54 patients who had spinal epidural metastases (93%). Most patients with cancer and back pain require myelography for accurate treatment planning. There are, however, situations in which treatment can be determined based on symptoms and plain films alone, with a low risk of missing epidural cancer."
CD008686,0,3830067,0,A case of normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism with osteomalacia.,"A 59 year-old patient had lumbago and pain in hip joints, knees, and ribs of long duration. Severe hypophosphatemia and high serum ionized calcium were found in spite of normal level of total serum calcium. The serum parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated, and diffuse demineralization of the bones and renal stones were found by x-ray examination. Parathyroid adenoma was diagnosed from the subtraction image of the 99mTc O-4 and 201Tl-Cl2 scintigrams. Osteomalacia was demonstrated by bone biopsy at the right iliac crest. A right lower parathyroid adenoma of 2.0 X 1.8 cm, weighing 4.0 g was removed. The long standing phosphate depletion and hypophosphatemia, due to hyperparathyroidism causing renal damage with nephrocalcinosis and reduced synthesis of active vitamin D, and milk tolerance due to gastroduodenostomy were probably responsible for producing the clinical picture of normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism complicated with osteomalacia."
CD008686,0,3096488,0,Sensory effects in man of lesions of the posterior columns and of some other afferent pathways.,"Clinical observations are presented on the sensory effects of lesions of different afferent pathways of the spinal cord, correlated whenever possible with histological evidence of the location and extent of the lesions. They are based on personal cases and on significant cases in the literature, including posterior column section, other causes of damage to the posterior columns, and cases of commissural myelotomy. It is concluded that the traditional view of the effects of lesions of the posterior columns is correct, but that evidence from cases proved by postmortem examination is still needed. When the information normally supplied by the posterior columns is cut off, primary sensibility for light touch and pressure is not lost, but any kind of discrimination is disturbed. There is also a disturbance in knowledge of movement and position, ataxia, and clumsiness in the use of the hands. These defects greatly affect the palpatory examination of objects and, although they may appear slight on routine neurological examination, they can cause severe disturbances in the activities of daily living. For tactile modalities, a lesion of the spinothalamic complex causes minimal or no defects and a lesion of the posterior columns causes only slight defects, whereas a lesion of both pathways gives rise to total loss of tactile and pressure sensibility in the part of the body served by both pathways. This conclusion is based on 2 cases with combined commissural myelotomy and anterolateral cordotomy. The following disturbances of mechanoreception attributed to lesions of the posterior columns are discussed: lability of threshold, persistence of sensation, tactile and postural hallucinations and temporal and spatial disturbances. In man, lesions of the posterior columns cause an increase in pain, tickle, warmth and cold. Cases are presented with and without lesions of the posterolateral columns in conjunction with lesions of one or both anterolateral columns. As these lesions did not affect sensation and as there was no difference in the sensory state following anterolateral cordotomies with or without involvement of the posterolateral column, it is concluded that lesions of this column have no effect on sensation. Cases with lesions of the anterior two-thirds of the cord are also presented to illustrate the sensory state with only the posterior third of the cord intact. In these cases, tactile and pressure sensibility and knowledge of movement and position are normal."
CD008686,0,2952045,0,Radionuclide bone imaging in patients with low back pain presenting to the orthopaedic surgeon.,"This study looks retrospectively at 113 patients with low back pain referred by orthopaedic surgeons for bone scanning. 79 scans (70%) were reported normal and 34 scans (30%) abnormal. 61 out of the 79 patients with normal scans were diagnosed and managed as ""chronic back strain"". Negative bone scans were also encountered in 3 patients with degenerative disease, 3 with prolapsed intervertebral disc and one with spondylolysis. In those patients with positive scans, a varied range of diagnoses was encountered, the main ones being bone metastases, previous trauma, osteomyelitis and degenerative disease. The scan was shown to be helpful in deciding on the presence or absence of pathology, and in identifying the sites of involvement, but not the nature of the disease. A higher likelihood of positivity is seen in the more elderly patients as well as those below 20 years of age. In interpreting the scan, the clinical context is important e.g. a history of trauma, previous surgery or of malignant disease. The bone scan may be normal in disc prolapse and in degenerative disease of the spine."
CD008686,0,2948012,0,"[Spontaneous fracture of the sacrum due to ""insufficiency"". An overlooked cause of low lumbago in elderly women].","A case of insufficiency fracture of the sacrum is reported. These fractures usually occur in elderly women and are secondary to various conditions, mainly postmenopausal or steroid-induced osteoporosis and radiation therapy. They are often overlooked or confused clinically and radiographically with metastatic disease. Findings on plain films are often subtle. Radionuclide bone scan shows a characteristic H or butterfly shaped pattern of increased uptake in the sacral alae. The diagnosis is confirmed by conventional tomograms or CT which show the fracture always surrounded by prominent sclerosis."
CD008686,0,3489903,0,Lumbar synovial or ganglion cysts.,"Most reports regarding synovial cysts of the spinal canal have been presentations identifying an unusual pathological entity that is to be included in the differential diagnosis of cauda equina compression syndromes. Most of the 26 cases reported represent isolated examples of this pathological process. We present five cases of lumbar synovial cysts encountered in our practice in the past 8 years. Patients with lumbar synovial cysts do not demonstrate any predictable clinical picture. They may present with a unilateral sciatica or neurogenic claudication. Lumbar extension is usually restricted, whereas flexion is full. Mechanical signs of nerve root entrapment or lumbosacral plexus irritation are unimpressive. Neurological deficits are usually mild, if present. Radiological findings include degenerative spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, and a rounded posterolateral extradural mass of low attenuation value adjacent to a facet shown on computed tomographic scan. The etiology of lumbar synovial cysts is not known. Histological findings of myxoid degeneration, microcystic change, calcification, and hemosiderin deposits suggest that chronic microtrauma with occasional focal hemorrhage may play a major role in the etiology of the cysts. With resection of the cyst, the postoperative course is usually uneventful. Recurrences have not yet been encountered in our patients."
CD008686,0,2949445,0,[Coccygodynia--a diagnostic and therapeutic problem in orthopedics].,"Coccygodynia means a lot of complaints with the most important of them, namely the spontaneous pain in the coccyx, in the top of the coccyx respectively. One can differ posttraumatic coccygodynias from others, which are the symptom of other diseases like lumbar pain, sciatica, tumors in the spinal canal, visceral diseases, that means disturbances in the gynaecologic system. By the mean of 19 predominantly female patients remarkable facts of the history, of the x-ray and clinical findings are listed up and compared in three different groups. To this examination the results of longtime-results of eleven patients who have been operated are united. The resection of the ""os coccygis"" doesn't seem to be a satisfying possibility to influence coccygodynias caused by traumas for a long time."
CD008686,0,3723172,0,Meningiomas of the clivus and apical petrous bone. Report of 35 cases.,"Between March, 1966, and June, 1985, 23 women and 12 men underwent partial or total resection of apical petrous or clivus meningiomas at The National Hospital for Nervous Diseases. Presenting symptoms were typically of long duration (mean 29 months) and consisted primarily of gait disturbance, headache, hearing loss, and facial pain. Cranial nerve deficits, especially affecting the fifth, seventh, and eighth nerves. were observed in nearly every patient. Tumor size, but not location, was generally associated with degree of preoperative disability. Plain skull films were usually unremarkable, but computerized tomography (CT) proved highly accurate in determining tumor location and size. A characteristic pattern of vascular displacement was seen on vertebral angiograms, although blood supply to the tumors was derived primarily from branches of the internal and external carotid arteries. Subtotal or total resection was undertaken in all cases; nine patients required adjunctive cerebrospinal fluid shunting procedures. Although surgical techniques evolved during the course of the 20-year study, a combined supra- and infratentorial approach proved a relatively safe and effective means of surgical treatment. New or worsened postoperative deficits, especially cranial nerve palsies, and complications in the immediate postoperative period frequently resulted in temporary deterioration of the clinical status during this period; the total operative mortality rate was 9%. Follow-up periods ranged up to 9 years; 70% of patients resumed an independent existence, and none is known to have required subsequent tumor surgery. The size of the lesion was the only significant factor in determining outcome. These data suggest that meningiomas of the clivus and apical petrous bone can be accurately diagnosed by CT and three-vessel angiography, and effectively treated by microsurgical resection."
CD008686,0,3748301,0,[Spinal epidural malignant lymphoma--report of two cases and review of the literature].,"Spinal epidural lymphoma is rarely found in Japan, comparing with Europe and America. We experienced two cases, who were suffered from intractable pain and gait disturbance. In both cases, a wide laminectomy and partial removal of the epidural tumor were performed because of the deteriorated paraparesis. After that, they were able to walk without support. These epidural tumors were supposed to be primary spinal epidural lymphomas, judging from the clinical course and some other examinations, that is, Gallium scintigram and CT scan, etc. There were few reports that mentioned CT findings of spinal lymphomas. In our two cases, we got the characteristic CT findings of spinal lymphomas. In case 1, plain CT demonstrated a high density mass at epidural space extending into the intra- and extra-foraminal region. CT scan following intravenous injection showed the tumor enhancement remarkably and homogeneously. Bone erosion was not found even on plain CT, in both cases. These findings were thought to be different from those of metastatic tumors. It may be possible to diagnose and decide the therapeutic planning preoperatively, when we get these characteristic CT findings of spinal lymphomas."
CD008686,0,3740815,0,Neurological manifestations in xeroderma pigmentosum.,"Xeroderma pigmentosum is an unusual neurocutaneous disorder. Recent studies have classified patients with xeroderma pigmentosum into 10 groups by somatic cell hybridization methods. In this report we describe 32 patients with Group A xeroderma pigmentosum, including 1 patient with an atypical case, who were assessed for neurological complications. Of these patients, 17 had microcephaly, 13 short stature, and 21 mental retardation. In patients over 7 years of age, sensorineural deafness and spinocerebellar signs such as nystagmus, dysarthria, tremor, and ataxia were frequently observed; no patients below 7 years of age had such neurological complications. Electroencephalographic studies revealed abnormal slow and low voltage background activity. Two patients had focal abnormal discharges, one of whom developed versive seizures. Cranial computed tomographic scans revealed abnormalities, including ventricular dilatation, cerebral atrophy, cerebellar and brainstem atrophy, and cranial bone thickening. A patient with an atypical case of Group A xeroderma pigmentosum had less skin and neurological involvement, and higher levels of postultraviolet colony-forming ability and host cell reactivation than did a typical Group A case. It is possible that these less severe cytological findings are responsible for the less severe skin lesions and neurological complications noted clinically."
CD008686,0,3729751,0,Hydrocephalic dementia and spinal cord tumor. Report of a case and review of the literature.,"A 68-year-old woman presented with an 18-month history of low back pain followed by leg weakness, dementia, and incontinence. Myelography revealed an intradural, extramedullary block from L-2 to L-4, and cranial computed tomography demonstrated ventriculomegaly. Excision of a benign schwannoma resulted in rapid relief of back pain and more gradual normalization of mental function and hydrocephalus. Five similar cases of dementia and hydrocephalus complicating spinal cord tumor have been reported. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association but the pathophysiology is still unclear. Spinal tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dementia and of communicating hydrocephalus."

Analysis of the available clinical data and radiographic studies revealed 22 patients (7.3%) with skeletal metastases demonstrated by radiography, computed tomography (CT), and/or nuclear scintigraphy. The plain film appearance of skeletal metastases from hepatoma was osteolytic in all cases. CT scanning best demonstrated the expansile, destructive nature of these metastases, which were often associated with large, bulky soft-tissue masses. Skeletal metastases from hepatomas demonstrated increased radiotracer uptake on standard bone scans and were gallium avid, similar to the hepatoma itself. In addition, they could be targeted therapeutically with I-131 antiferritin immunoglobulin. The most frequent sites of skeletal metastases were the ribs, spine, femur, pelvis, and humerus. An initial symptom in ten patients was skeletal pain corresponding to the osseous metastases. In five patients, pathologic fractures of the proximal femur or humerus developed and required total hip replacement or open-reduction internal fixation. Patients with long-standing cirrhosis or known hepatocellular carcinoma who also have skeletal symptoms should be evaluated for possible osseous metastases."
CD008686,0,3762852,0,[Neuroradiological evaluation of benign extramedullary tumors in the high cervical region and at the foramen magnum].,"Twelve cases of benign extramedullary tumors in the high cervical region and at the foramen magnum were experienced during past five years among eighty all spinal and paraspinal tumors. The diagnosis of masses in this region is very difficult because of the variety of clinical course, symptoms and neurological findings as pointed out by many reporters. Also in our cases, 70% of the patients complained of the deteriorated motor weakness of the upper or lower extremities on admission, though they had noticed the onset of slight neck or occipital pain a few years ago. Neurological examination on admission clearly showed the symptom of myelopathy except in two cases with a tumor at the foramen magnum and C1 level. The percentage of positive findings of plain X-rays was 50%, that of metrizamide myelography was 92% and that of IV. e. CT and met. e. CT was 100%. NMR-CT was performed in 2 cases, and in one of them it was useful in confirming the tumor configuration and extension. Five interesting cases were described mainly from the neuroradiological aspects. Finally the differentiation between meningioma and neurinoma was discussed from the aspects of myelogram, CT and NMR-CT. As already pointed out, it is most important not to forget the existence of tumors in this region when one comes across the confused symptoms, afterwards not to overlook the slight positive neurological and neuroradiological findings."
CD008686,0,3736799,0,Postradiation sarcoma involving the spine.,"Postradiation sarcomas arising many years after treatment of cancer are long term sequelae of therapy. We describe the clinical features, radiographic findings, and results of treatment in 13 patients with such sarcomas encountered over a 6-year period. Of these patients, 9 had bone sarcomas and the remaining 4 had paraspinal tumors arising from adjacent soft tissue and nerve. The primary cancer for which radiation was given included Hodgkin's disease (4 patients), breast cancer (2 patients), cervix cancer (2 patients), and a variety of others (5 patients). The latent interval to the occurrence of the second neoplasm varied from 6 to 30 years (median, 10 years) after treatment of the original tumor. Despite aggressive treatment, the overall prognosis was poor. The median survival was 8 months, with only 3 surviving more than 2 years. Although rare, postradiation sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with late onset of spinal pain or neurological symptoms after clinical remission of an original cancer."
CD008686,0,3721935,0,The incidence of late endocrine dysfunction following irradiation for childhood medulloblastoma.,"A retrospective analysis of treatment in 20 patients who had received post-operative radiotherapy for medulloblastoma between 1969 and 1977 was completed. The patients were followed for a minimum of 60 months. Eleven patients survived for 5 or more years after treatment. The patients received 3600 cGy to the whole brain. The posterior fossa received 5600 cGY and the spinal axis 3600 cGY. Eight of eleven patients developed growth impairment; 6 of 7 patients had growth hormone deficiency. Since all endocrine gland failures are amenable to therapy, early attention to patients' growth rate and detection of hypothalamic-pituitary failure, would be of benefit to longterm survivors."
CD008686,0,3459394,0,[Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and hypophosphatemic osteomalacia associated with tumor].,"Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and hypophosphatemic osteomalacia are both associated with neoplasm and unusual clinical syndromes. Although the etiologies of these conditions are unknown, their clinical courses are interesting, so we are reporting two cases of these conditions separately. Case 1: A 20-year-old man had an osteogenic sarcoma originating in the 2nd thoracic vertebra which was developing in the mediastinal region. He had complained of numbness and swelling in the left arm and of clubbing of the fingers of both hands. A chest radiograph showed a billiard-ball-sized, round opacity in the left upper mediastinal region. Periosteal new bone formation was demonstrated symmetrically in both humeri, radii, ulnae, femurs, tibiae, fibulae and metacarpals. Case 2: A 30-year-old man had complained of lower back, hip, knee and ankle pain and muscle weakness of five years' duration and was admitted to the National Yokosuka Hospital. Surum phosphorus was 0.7 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase was 24.9 K.A. and glucosuria was noted. He had a fibrous xanthoma on the right thigh, and after removal of the tumor, his symptoms improved dramatically and pertinent laboratory data returned to normal. However, ossification of the ligaments of the spine subsequently developed."
CD008686,0,3090473,0,Administration of intraspinal morphine sulfate for the treatment of intractable cancer pain.,"A total of 24 patients with intractable cancer pain were evaluated as candidates for spinal morphine therapy. Temporary trials were carried out with bolus injections of preservative-free morphine sulfate via percutaneously inserted epidural catheters. Fourteen patients felt that pain relief was sufficient to warrant long term morphine application, and permanent drug delivery systems were implanted. These consisted of an Ommaya reservoir and an epidural spinal catheter in 6 patients and an Infusaid pump with either an epidural or subarachnoid spinal catheter in 8 patients. Pain relief with these systems was felt to be excellent in 7 patients, good in 4 patients, and fair in 3 patients. There was a statistically significant reduction in supplemental narcotic use between the pre- and postoperative periods (P less than 0.001). Median survival after operation was 3.0 months (mean, 5.0 months), with a range of 1 to 23 months. Tolerance was seen in all patients regardless of the mode of drug delivery, but it occurred more quickly with bolus injections than with continuous infusion (statistically significant difference, P less than 0.05). A persistent cerebrospinal fluid fistula developed in 1 patient; this required wound revision. No other serious complications or episodes of respiratory depression occurred. We conclude that intraspinal morphine sulfate is a beneficial treatment option for cancer patients in whom pain has become debilitating and unresponsive to oral or parenteral narcotic regimes."
CD008686,0,3014070,0,Diagnosis of brachial root and plexus lesions.,"The diagnosis and management of lesions of the brachial roots and of the brachial plexus is improved by appropriate investigation, both in acute and chronic disorders. The choice of investigation should be determined by the clinical problem. Since they are relatively non-invasive, electrophysiological investigations are particularly useful. In this review the role of these investigations is considered in relation to diagnosis and management."
CD008686,0,2422332,0,Continuous intrathecal hydromorphone and clonidine for intractable cancer pain.,"The use of hydromorphone and clonidine, delivered intrathecally by an implanted infusion pump, is described in a patient with intractable cancer pain. The patient was a 48-year-old woman with uterine cervical cancer-related pain that was poorly responsive to conventional oral narcotics. Hydromorphone was used because of the patient's history of morphine intolerance. When progressive intrathecal hydromorphone dosages were required, intrathecal clonidine (an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist) was infused concomitantly. Intrathecal hydromorphone and clonidine successfully controlled this patient's pain without the necessity to resort to destructive neurosurgery."
CD008686,0,3708990,0,The long-term results of chymopapain. Ten-year follow-up of 268 patients after chemonucleolysis.,"The effect of chymopapain injection was investigated in myelographically confirmed intervertebral disc herniation in 268 patients after ten years. Mean age is 39.4 years, 178 males and 90 females. Sixty-two patients had compensation or litigation and 12 had prior lumbar spine surgery. Discography was performed in 223 patients, resulting in 134 one-level injections, 124 two-level injections, and ten three-level injections. Forty percent of the patients experienced postoperative muscle spasm for several days. No complications were seen in 241 patients (92%) who were available for follow-up examination at ten years; 86% had less leg pain, 82% were employed at a capacity equal to or greater than before injection, 9% were at a less strenuous job, 1% were disabled, and 8% had retired. In 22 patients treated surgically within one year of chemonucleolysis, disc-related pathology was present in 14 cases and spondylosis or spinal stenosis was present in seven cases. One had a negative exploration and continued to be disabled. Eight patients came to surgical intervention after one year because of persisting symptoms: four patients had disc protrusion, three had laminectomy and spinal fusion, and one had a decompressive laminectomy secondary to spondylotic change. Chemonucleolysis did not prejudice the outcome of subsequent surgical treatment with good results following this intervention. One tumor, a neurofibroma, was found in this study. Chemonucleolysis with chymopapain was a safe and effective treatment of radicular complaints caused by well-documented intervertebral disc herniation."
CD008686,0,3702563,0,Manifestations of Pott's disease in the head and neck.,"Tuberculosis (TB) of the spine, or Pott's disease, is a rarely encountered clinical disorder in the United States today. However, Pott's disease should be strongly suspected in a person who presents with a destructive lesion of the spine involving adjacent vertebrae or a retropharyngeal mass which extends across the midline. The most common presenting signs and symptoms are pain and spinal deformity. The PPD skin test is usually positive, but unlike TB of the larynx, the chest roentgenogram is almost always negative. Diagnosis may be confirmed by needle aspiration or incisional biopsy and culture. The otolaryngologic literature has not previously addressed this clinical entity, thus, our experience with a patient with a retropharyngeal mass and quadriplegia diagnosed as Pott's disease will be presented. Subsequent medical therapy, stabilization, and odontoidectomy resulted in resolution of his neurological deficit. The incidence, pathogenesis, clinical features, and management of Pott's disease will be discussed."
CD008686,0,3698432,0,CT and nuclear medicine imaging in vertebral metastases.,"Three cases are presented to illustrate the value of CT in elucidating the diagnosis in cancer patients presenting with complaints that are clinically highly suspicious for osseous metastases, where isotope bone imaging and conventional radiography failed to confirm the clinician's suspicion."
CD008686,0,3453938,0,CT scan helps delineate cervical osteoid osteoma and atypical nidus.,"Computerized tomography proves to be particularly helpful in anatomically delineating an osteoid osteoma of the spine in an inaccessible area and in also identifying an atypical nidus. A case is presented of an 8-year-old boy with a one-year history of pain in the right shoulder and neck. Computerized tomography accurately delineated in anatomic detail the lesion along with an atypical nidus adjacent to the spinal canal, thus assuring total excision of both lesions. The patient regained normal neck and shoulder motion with no recurrence of pain."
CD008686,0,3952633,0,Osteoid osteomas of the spine.,"Seven patients with spinal osteoid osteomas are reported and another 110 cases from the literature are reviewed. Among the patients spinal pain is the constant clinical complaint, while radicular pain and scoliosis are present in half of the patients. Whereas radiograms and tomograms of the spine are sometimes inadequate for diagnosis, bone scanning is positive in 100% of patients and is useful for directing spinal computed tomography at the exact level of the lesion. Complete removal of the tumoral nidus produces remission of pain in more than 95% of cases. The possibility of an erroneous diagnosis of a lumbar protruded disk and the necessity of a bone scan in young patients with spinal or radicular pain are emphasized."
CD008686,0,3724979,0,[CT findings in acute spinal epidural hematoma caused by a ruptured cavernous angioma].,"A case of acute spinal epidural hematoma due to the rupture of cavernous angioma is reported. A 68-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of hematoemesis. After the successful treatment of bleeding from a gastric ulcer by using endoscopical method, he noticed severe motor weakness in his lower extremities. Complete paraparesis of his lower limbs, total sensory loss below the level of fifth thoracic vertebrae, and bladder disturbance were revealed on neurological examination. A metrizamide myelogram showed complete block at the level of fourth thoracic vertebrae. A computed tomography (CT) scan disclosed a dorsolateral heterogeneous high density area (92 Hounsfield Unit) on the right with displacement of the spinal cord to the left, extending from the level of second to fifth thoracic vertebrae. He was operated thirty hours after the onset. After the laminectomy, an epidural hematoma covering over the dural sac was recognized. Following the removal of the hematoma, a hemorrhagic mass was disclosed and removed successfully. A pathological examination revealed cavernous angioma. His symptoms improved partially in three months after the operation. There have been thirteen cases of non-traumatic spinal epidural hematoma which had been diagnosed by CT scan, as far as we are aware. Although only four cases out of 13 were diagnosed without using any contrast materials, we stress that the spinal epidural hematoma can be diagnosed only by plain CT scan because of its characteristic clinical feature, attenuation coefficient, and mass effect to the spinal cord."
CD008686,0,3516923,0,The menopause.,"Symptoms due to estrogen deficiency begin in the perimenopausal years and progress as serum levels of this hormone decrease Vasomotor instability, manifested by hot flushes or night sweats, may persist for several months to a few years. Psychologic symptoms include anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, palpitations, and headaches. Atrophy of the genital epithelium may result in senile vaginitis with symptoms of irritation, burning, pruritus, dyspareunia, and even vaginal bleeding. Even the lower urinary tract mucosa is dependent upon estrogen. Postmenopausal osteoporosis affects 25 to 50% of older women and increases the risk for vertebral, hip, and other fractures. Estrogen therapy for menopausal complaints has received adverse publicity because several reports have indicated that unopposed estrogens increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Added progestogen not only negates this risk but reduces the incidence of endometrial adenocarcinoma in estrogen-progestogen users to less than that observed in untreated women. Estrogen replacement therapy does not increase the risk of breast cancer; the incidence of this malignancy, however, was also less in the estrogen-progestogen users when compared with either the untreated women or from that expected from the national cancer surveys. In evaluating postmenopausal women for hormone replacement, the benefits of estrogen-progestogen therapy must be weighed against possible risks."
CD008686,0,3703125,0,[Foramen magnum tumor--the diagnosis and surgical approach].,"The seven cases of the foramen magnum tumors were presented with the clinical manifestations and surgical consideration. Early clinical symptoms of the cases with extramedullary lesions were suboccipital neck pain followed by dysesthesia, clumsiness of hand and weakness. On the other hand, early symptoms of the cases with intramedullary lesions were dysesthesia, often followed by swallowing difficulty or hoarsness, which may have some difference from the clinical course of the extramedullary tumor cases. CT scan was remarkably useful in the diagnosis of the foramen magnum tumor. Surgical treatment was done to 6 cases: Five of these cases were operated by suboccipital craniectomy, and one case with an anteriorly located meningioma in the foramen magnum region was operated by transoral approach. Total removal could be performed in the case without damage to the medulla or spinal cord. The surgical treatment was reviewed, and the approach appropriate to tumor location around the foramen magnum should be selected."
CD008686,0,3084994,0,Spinal neurofibromas: a report of 66 cases and a comparison with meningiomas.,"A series of 66 spinal cord neurofibromas was analyzed for history, signs, surgical approach, and outcome. The tumors presented primarily with sensory symptoms. Plain films were abnormal in 1/2 of cases and 1/2 had a complete block. They were primarily intradural, and primarily thoracic. A conservative exam system was used for follow-up and 85% with pain had complete relief; 50% with motor loss had normal motor function, and 88% had normal sensation who had prior sensory loss. In comparison to meningiomas, the principal differences were that neurofibromas had an even sex distribution, a lower incidence of cord signs and symptoms, more frequent findings on plain x-rays, and higher cerebrospinal fluid protein. Surgical outcome was similar. Sacrifice of the involved root during removal usually did not produce a deficit. The series is compared with a similar series of meningiomas from the same institution over the same time period."
CD008686,0,3082166,0,Radiologic evaluation of spinal cord fissures.,"The clinical course and radiographic studies were reviewed of eight patients with posttraumatic spinal cord fissures (rents in the spinal cord communicating with the subarachnoid space). Five patients had spinal cord fissures associated with symptomatic intramedullary cysts that required shunting to alleviate progressive neurologic deficits and intractable pain. Their metrizamide myelograms showed contrast medium passing immediately from the subarachnoid sac into the spinal cord and their immediate metrizamide CT scans delineated the entire extent of the secondary cord cysts. Intraoperative sonography confirmed the presence of the cord fissures with sizeable cysts, detected adhesions, and guided myelotomies and the subsequent shunting and collapse of the cysts. Since neurologic improvement followed the shunting procedures in all five patients treated for progressive symptoms, it was concluded that early radiologic evaluation of posttraumatic spinal cord fissures with symptomatic cord cysts is crucial in the clinical management of these patients."
CD008686,0,3009674,0,Diagnosis of perineurial arachnoid cysts using computed tomography: technical and clinical considerations.,"Perineurial arachnoid cysts are often multiple lesions that are usually found in the lumbosacral area. These cysts may cause compression of surrounding structures. Examination of the first, second and third sacral nerves should be performed on patients with prolonged symptoms of a herniated disc or cauda equina syndrome. Three cases are presented for which computed tomography provided accurate, noninvasive diagnosis. Perineurial cysts are often associated with asymptomatic herniated disc; thus, surgery on the disc with an underlying symptomatic cyst may result in a failed back syndrome."
CD008686,0,2937281,0,Low back pain.,"Low back pain is a frequent source of disability during the productive years of life. Repeated trauma is a major causative factor. Maintaining ideal body weight and good muscle tone, especially of the abdominal musculature, can minimize low back pain. Lumbar disc protrusion and extrusion may be treated by medical therapy, by neurosurgical intervention or possibly by chemonucleolysis. Other important causes of back pain are arthritis, facet disease and spinal stenosis. Evaluation of low back pain should include tests to uncover a psychogenic source."
CD008686,0,3712037,0,Stippled ribs: a potential pitfall in bone scan interpretation.,"A retrospective evaluation of 100 consecutive bone scans was performed to determine the incidence and clinical importance, if any, of increased uptake at the insertion of the iliocostalis thoracis portion of the erector spinae muscle group (rib stippling). Rib stippling was deemed present if a focal area of increased technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate [( 99mTc]MDP) was identified within the posterior angle of three or more consecutive ribs. Seven of 100 (three bilateral, four unilateral) patients demonstrated rib stippling. Foci intensity was less than the scapular tips, but greater than the adjacent ribs. No patient had a history of chest trauma, pain and/or an abnormal radiograph. Even though increased uptake within the posterior angle of the ribs is an uncommon finding (7%), its recognition as a normal bone scan finding is important to prevent bone scan misinterpretations. Its characteristic scintigraphic appearance and location should serve to differentiate it from the increased uptake of trauma and/or tumor."
CD008686,0,3822026,0,[Panmedullary ependymoma with complete excision in several stages. Apropos of a case].,"Treatment of a panmedullary ependymoma involved a three-stage operation with total excision under microscopic control and the use of the Cavitron. The patient, a 22 year old woman, presented with a three-year history, with clinical onset of staged spinal pain and cervicobrachial neuralgia, of spasmodic paraparesis with sensory and sphincter disturbances. The extent of the lesion from C3 to L2 was determined from data from conventional myelography with Iopamiron, a CT scan with intrathecal contrast and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of sagittal and frontal sections. The tumor, a grade I ependymoma, was treated by three-stage laminectomies (L2-T12, T12-T3, T3-C3), total excision being obtained by ultrasound fragmentation (Cavitron). Gross pathology showed a heterogeneous appearance with two cysts, one capping the tumor from the bulbospinal junction to C3, the other attached to the medullary cone. Hemorrhagic cavities were noted at cervicothoracic region and multiple microcysts in the dorsal expansion. The postoperative course was uneventful with recovery of walking wearing a bivalve acrylic corset, the most disturbing functional complication being the posterior cord syndrome responsible for an ataxia."
CD008686,0,3777564,0,[Long-term intrathecal isobaric morphine therapy].,"In order to evaluate long-term intrathecal morphine therapy for cancer pain, whatever its location, 121 patients (80% were ambulatory patients) treated between April 1979 and April 1985 at the Cancer Institute of Montpellier (Centre Paul-Lamarque) were assessed. Morphine was stored in a presternal insulin syringe, protected by a sterile and waterproof dressing. A bolus administration of morphine via a subcutaneous lombo-epigastric subarachnoid catheter was scheduled every 12 h. This ""closed"" device was opened for refilling in an operating room only. The mean follow-up was 68 days (maximum: 13 months). More than 15,000 intrathecal injections were made. The mean daily amount of morphine required was 2.3 mg (extremes: 0.75 and 21 mg). All patients developed tolerance, requiring an adjustment of morphine dosages every 30 to 45 days. With the isobaric morphine solution, good or very good analgesia was achieved in 82% of patients, even in those suffering from thoracic or otolaryngologic pain. Mechanical complications (catheter coming out of the subarachnoid space in 7.67% of cases, leakage of CSF along the catheter in 9.16% of cases) were related to the exteriorization of the proximal catheter tip. With the exception of errors in manipulation, neither infection nor clinical respiratory depression were noticed. Nausea and vomiting were frequent but resolved spontaneously within a few days. Urine retention (33%) occurred mainly in men over 65 years, after pelvic surgery or radiotherapy. Because of the absence of a defined zone of analgesia, the small volumes required and the ""ready for use"" preparation, intrathecal isobaric morphine therapy will lead to easy self-administration via an implanted pump in the future.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The neurological symptomatology was due to the compression of the spinal cord or the vessels supplying it. The results of the treatment depended on the sensitivity of the lymphosarcoma to cytostatic therapy and on how early the treatment was initiated.

Report of a case.,"Neurogenic tumors of the posterior mediastinum commonly constitute an extraspinal portion of a dumb-bell tumor affecting the spinal canal. In a 42-year-old man with a history of back pain for more than 6 months and severe lower-limb paralysis and impaired urinary voiding for 20 days, chest radiography showed a posterior mediastinal mass and thoracic myelogram a total extradural defect at the level of T10. A computed tomography scan showed extension of this intrathoracic mass into the intraspinal space through the spinal foramen. In a single-stage operation, posterolateral thoracotomy and laminectomy were performed. This surgical approach avoids complications, notably from traction on the spinal cord."

CD008686,0,3524591,0,[Spontaneous bone marrow micrometastasis of a cerebral glioma. Immunohistochemical diagnosis in a biopsy sample and review of the literature].,"A 55 year-old woman was admitted to hospital in January 1981 with transient expressive dysphasia. Past personal history was unremarkable except for a six-month history of renal colic and thrombophlebitis in the veins of the right leg. Computed tomographic scan of the head and carotid angiogram revealed a left calcified temporoparietal tumor. Because of pulmonary embolism it was decided to refute a cerebral biopsy. The patient also declined radiotherapy. In May 1983, a thorough workup revealed an incomplete fracture of the first lumbar vertebra and a diffuse demineralization of the rachis and pelvis. Four weeks later she developed temporal epilepsy and pulmonary embolism. A whole brain irradiation (60 Gy) was performed in August 1983. The patient's condition remained clinically stable until December 1984 when she was readmitted to hospital with a severe weight loss, diffuse osseous pain and pancytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy from the iliac crest showed a diffuse tumor involvement. Peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining using monoclonal antiserum to glial fibrillary acidic protein was strongly positive in numerous tumors cells. The pathological diagnosis was bone marrow metastasis by glioma. She died in March 1985, 4 years and 3 months after the first admission to hospital. Autopsy was not performed. A literature search reveals only 9 cases of extraneural spreading of astrocytomas and glioblastomas in the absence of previous craniotomy with post-mortem examination. The authors also comment on the clinical, pathological and histogenic aspects of extraneural metastasis of gliomas."
CD008686,0,3487742,0,[Microsurgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Results and prognostic factors of microsurgical vascular decompression].,"The authors have reviewed 100 cases of trigeminal neuralgia operated upon at the cerebello-pontine angle using microsurgical techniques, i.e. 20% of their total series of 513 patients with tic douloureux, 413 of them having been submitted to percutaneous R.F.--thermocoagulation. In 10 of the above 100 patients, a tumour or an angioma have been found and with its removal a total relief of pain has been obtained. In all but three of the other 90 patients, a neurovascular conflict has been revealed. In 17 of them a selective section of the trigeminal root had to be performed, as its cross-compression could not be eliminated. A total cure was achieved in all but three cases in which the result was only partial. In 70 patients a microvascular decompression (MVD) was performed and in 68 of them a follow-up of 1 to 5 years has been analyzed. In 82.4% the results were excellent. Further 7.3% thought to be benefited by the operation; although they still had some pain, they were well controlled by medical treatment. In 10.3% an unsatisfactory improvement, failure or recurrence were noted. Then a critical study of the whole material has been made in search for the causes of unsatisfactory results and for the possibilities of making the efficacity of MVD ascertained in a higher percentage of patients. The results of this study lead to definite conclusions, a part of which is quoted below: Some of clinical findings showed to be of paramount importance for the prognosis. The most evident has been a highly significant difference in the percentage of a total cure in patients with attacks of tic douloureux only (94.5%) and in those with the same type of attacks, but associated with permanent pain (58.3%). The analysis of the operative findings and of the details of the surgical procedure indicated to a necessity of restitution of the normal shape and course of the trigeminal root from the petrous ridge up to the entry-zone and of an adequate root protection (for instance with Dacron), after the Vth nerve had been detached from the conflicting vessel. A correlation of the above findings with the angiographic ones has been made. A measurable method has been used to make available data which could be informative as to the presence of a conflict, as well as to its anatomical cause. But this still needs a further critical elaboration."

Clinical findings strongly directed further investigations to the popliteal fossa. Ultrasonography located a hypoechogenic mass in the upper lateral popliteal space. Guided by these data, computerized tomography (CT) with vertical reconstructions made the tentative diagnosis of a common peroneal nerve tumor, which was confirmed at operation. Microscopic examination showed a neurinoma of the mixed neurilemmoma-neurofibroma type. In the presence of atypical features of sciatica, a high index of suspicion seems advisable. Emphasis is laid on the complementary contribution of ultrasonography and CT in this type of ill-defined lower limb pain."
CD008686,0,4095476,0,[Bone scintigraphy in multiple myeloma].,"The results of bone scintigraphy were compared with those of plain skeletal X-rays in 26 patients with multiple myeloma who all presented radiological and/or scintigraphic skeletal lesions. 364 bone sites were studied: 135 of them were abnormal, 64 on the plain X-ray alone, 21 on scintigraphy alone and 50 on both examinations. The sensitivity of the bone scintigraphy was only greater than that of plain X-rays for the thoracic lesions (sternum and ribs). The skeletal lesions detected by scintigraphy in addition to those detected on the X-ray would have changed the clinical staging of the patient in only 3 cases. Purely lytic lesions of the thoraco-lumbar spine were never detected by bone scintigraphy. More than one third of the compression fractures were also missed by this examination. The radiological course of 13 sites initially abnormal only on the bone scintigraphy was followed for 6 to 24 months; after this period of time, 9 of these lesions were still radiologically normal. In 6 patients, the radiographic and scintigraphic course could be compared to the clinical and laboratory data on 14 occasions: both pain X-rays and scintigraphy were only concordant with the clinical and laboratory course in no more than one half of cases. The number of abnormal sites on scintigraphy was no different in the patients who responded to treatment. In multiple myeloma, bone scintigraphy only detects a little more than half of the skeletal lesions. When performed in addition to plain X-rays, it detects about 16 per cent of additional lesions, particularly in the ribs and sternum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The age range was 7 to 34 years and the average clinical follow up was 63 months. The cervical spine was involved in four patients, thoracic in four, lumbar in six and the sacrum in one patient. Back or neck pain associated with stiffness was present in all cases and was often accompanied by scoliosis or torticollis. All the patients with osteoid osteoma were symptom relieved by surgery without recurrence. Seven of the patients with benign osteoblastoma presented with neurological signs or symptoms and three of these had recurrence following primary surgery. Although cortical and spongious osteoblastoma are considered as members of the same family of benign tumors of osteoblastic derivation, spongious osteoblastoma does not seem to be limited in growth potential as is cortical osteoblastoma."

The highest incidence of this disease was seen in the 5th decade and the average age of the patients was 58.8 years. Male patients predominated over the female patients, the ratio being 1.6: 1. According to Robson's classification, thirty eight cases were in stage I, five cases in stage II, nine cases in stage III and thirty cases in stage IV. The overall survival rate at one, three and five years was 77, 58 and 48%, respectively. The most common symptom was macroscopic hematuria, followed by asymptomatic, lumbago and palpable mass. The site of distant metastases was most frequently in the lung, followed by the bone, liver and lymph node. There were no remarkable differences in the prognosis of stage I patients, between the group treated with preoperative renal arterial embolization and non-treated group. No remarkable difference was seen between the survival rate of the stage IV patients treated by nephrectomy and these not treated by nephrectomy. Renal arterial embolization was an effective therapeutic measure for patients with non-resectable stage IV renal cell carcinoma (p = 0.0647, compared with non-treated group)."

We report two of them. A 68-year-old male had slowly progressive dull pain in both thighs for about 6 years prior to admission. Neurological examination and plain x-ray on admission showed no abnormality. Myodil myelography showed a S-IAC at T4 vertebral level. Surgical treatment of cyst wall excision resulted in success. The other case, a 39-year-old male suddenly noticed monoparesis and sensory disturbance of left leg in the morning. On admission were observed spastic monoparesis of the left leg, analgesia at right T2-3 cord segment and sensory disturbance (hypesthesia, dysesthesia, paresthesia) below T3-4 cord segment on the left side. Plain X-ray showed no abnormality. Myodil myelography revealed a S-IAC at T3-4 vertebral level. This patient was treated not surgically but conservatively because all neurological deficits but numbness in the left leg almost subsided after bed rest. The patient has experienced no neurological deterioration for five years since then. We also discuss the clinical feature, treatment and etiology of the S-IAC, by analyzing these 82 cases. There is a slight male preponderance. The age ranges between 3 and 66 years (mean 38 years). The duration from onset to admission is 2 days to 30 years. Sixty percent (48/80) of the cases were ill far longer than a year (mean 6.7 years).

The main clinical symptom was a slowly progressive spastic tetraparesis, but during the last years he also developed bilateral neurogenic deafness, dysfunction of the urinary bladder and loss of vibratory and positional sensation in the legs. Autopsy revealed a unique combination of neuropathological findings, namely 1) multiple neurilemmomas of the cauda equina with loss of nerve fibers in dorsal roots and Goll's tracts, 2) symmetric fiber loss in the lateral corticospinal tracts throughout the spinal cord, and 3) a cavernous hemangioma of the lower thoracic spinal cord. No changes of multiple sclerosis were found. It is postulated that the patient may have had both neurofibromatosis and a sporadic or familial form of primary lateral sclerosis. The hemangioma in the spinal cord is probably unrelated to these two conditions, although it cannot be excluded that it represents a manifestation of von Recklinghausen's disease."

CD008686,0,4054633,0,Headaches in older patients: Ddx and Tx of common nonvascular causes.,"From this and the previous article, the following points may be offered in summary: When comparing the elderly age group with the general population, the incidence of migraine headaches decreases with age, whereas other etiologies such as glaucoma, temporal arteritis, and cerebrovascular disease may assume a more prominent role in the differential diagnosis. Patients in the geriatric population are frequently taking a multitude of medications, and it is extremely important to carefully evaluate these for possible precipitants of headache. Furthermore, in elderly patients with other potential medical problems, particular attention should be paid to the possibility of various systemic causes of headache. Therapy for specific headache disorders should be tailored to the individual patient. Consider the patient's overall general, psychological, medical, and neurologic background. The physician must be aware of possible interactions of medications with the therapeutic intervention, as well as possible poor tolerance to specific medications due to preexisting medical or neurologic disorders. A complete history, obtaining information on the temporal pattern of headache, the distribution of pain, and precipitating and alleviating factors, is extremely important in evaluating the elderly patient. A careful physical examination, paying particular attention to possible disorders of extracranial structures, is indicated. A neurologic exam, including basic tests of higher cortical function, should be obtained. Important additional laboratory investigations include a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and basic blood chemistries. Arterial blood gases should be obtained in patients who have pulmonary disease, a history suggestive of sleep apnea, or other disorders that may produce hypoxia and hypercarbia, resulting in vascular headache.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Lung cancer and breast cancer were the most frequently occurring primary neoplasms, but a wide variety of solid tumors may cause intramedullary spinal cord metastasis. The presenting symptoms were pain and/or weakness. The neurologic status deteriorated rapidly in the majority of patients in a period to days to weeks. Progression to a cord hemisection syndrome or cord transection occurred in approximately half of the patients. The characteristic myelographic appearance of fusiform swelling of the cord was seen in one third of the patients, but the myelogram was normal in 42%. Plain radiographs of the spine showed no evidence of metastatic disease in three fourths of cases. The cerebrospinal fluid protein level was frequently elevated, but results of cytologic studies were usually negative. High-resolution computer-assisted tomographic scanning may show intramedullary metastases. Radiation therapy combined with corticosteroid administration offers the only effective palliation. The recognition of intramedullary spinal cord metastasis is an ominous finding. Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis generally occurred in the setting of widespread systemic and intracranial disease, but occasionally was the only site of relapse. More than 80% of patients died within 3 months. Heightened awareness of this entity may lead to early diagnosis at a stage when neurologic deficits are reversible and, it is hoped, more effective palliation can be achieved."

The only difference between groups 2 and 3 were that patients in group 3 had a rather longer history, both articular surfaces were involved and showed a possible increase in the incidence of degenerative joint disease elsewhere. It is suggested that condensing osteitis is but a part of a spectrum of degenerative disease of the sterno-clavicular joints, akin to discogenic vertebral body sclerosis (McCarthy & Dorfman, 1982)."

Diagnostic criteria include: (1) acute visual loss (monocular or binocular), (2) visual field defects indicating optic nerve or chiasmal dysfunction, (3) absence of optic disc edema, (4) onset usually within three years of therapy (peak: 1-1 1/2 years), and (5) no computed tomographic evidence of visual pathway compression. Pathologic findings, differential diagnosis and therapy will be discussed in outlining the clinical profile of RON."
CD008686,0,2413419,0,Neuropathologic lesions and CSF morphine concentrations during chronic continuous intraspinal morphine infusion. A clinical and post-mortem study.,"Seven patients with chronic intractable pain due to cancer were given chronic intraspinal narcotic administration (CINA) and subsequently underwent post-mortem examination. All deaths were unrelated to CINA. Two of these patients were found to have clinically unsuspected posterior column degeneration. Both patients had had epidural catheters placed, and one had received prior radiotherapy to ports which included parts of the spinal cord. In retrospect, it is impossible to ascertain whether the degeneration occurred before or after infusion of morphine began. Review of the potential causes for posterior column degeneration suggests that neuropathy associated with malignant disease is more likely the cause of the degeneration rather than intraspinal infusion of morphine. However, continued vigilance at autopsy is recommended. In addition, utilizing a new method for measuring cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of morphine via high-pressure liquid chromatography, CSF morphine levels at steady state were measured in 5 patients. These levels were much lower than peak levels previously reported following bolus intraspinal administration. The ability of these measurements to contribute to knowledge of efficacy, toxicity, lumbar-cisternal concentration gradients, and differentiation of tolerance from drug delivery problems is discussed."
CD008686,0,4072670,0,Sarcoidosis of the spinal cord. Report of an autopsy case and review of the literature.,"The authors report a female elderly patient with quadriplegia, hypesthesia below the neck, and rectourinary dysfunction, which were found at autopsy to have been caused by involvement of the lower cervical and upper thoracic segments of the spinal cord in systemic sarcoidosis. Sixty cases of spinal cord sarcoidosis reported in the literature are also reviewed. Most patients had clinical signs which mimicked those of a spinal cord tumor or meningomyelitis. Only in less than one-third of the cases had sarcoidosis been diagnosed before neurological symptoms occurred. Macroscopically, most intramedullary lesions formed a mass, whereas extramedullary lesions usually manifested as meningitis. Histologically, perivascular distribution of sarcoid granulomas was noted in our patient as well as in many cases reported in the literature. The clinical course of the patients with spinal sarcoidosis was usually poor when early diagnosis was not made."
CD008686,0,4015360,0,Diabetic Charcot spine as cauda equina syndrome: an unusual presentation.,"Some 6% to 21% of Charcot joints occur in the spine. The underlying disease is usually tabes dorsalis, but diabetes mellitus is another etiology. Degeneration of spinal elements is accelerated and lumbar spinal stenosis with weakness may occur, as has been reported in tabetic arthropathy. The case presented is unusual in two respects: first, the Charcot spine was secondary to diabetic complications, which resulted in a compressive cauda equina syndrome; second, the patient presented with progressive paraparesis and bowel and bladder dysfunction but physical examination by several examiners revealed no clinically evident sensory abnormality. The patient had vague and inconsistent sensory complaints for several years preceding definitive workup, but the overall picture of his disease process only could be made following multiple laboratory, electrodiagnostic, microbiologic, and radiologic testing. The patient presented with subacute paraparesis, providing a wide differential diagnosis ranging from Guillain-Barré syndrome to spinal neoplasm. The physical, radiologic, laboratory, electrophysiologic, histologic/pathologic findings, treatment, and recovery status are included in this report."

CD008686,0,4026230,0,Leptomeningeal metastases: peripheral nerve and root involvement--clinical and electrophysiological study.,"Twenty-five patients with recently diagnosed leptomeningeal metastases underwent a prospective clinical and electro-physiological study to assess the mode and extent of peripheral nerve and spinal root involvement. Motor conduction velocities and F wave latencies in the legs were found frequently to be disturbed compared with normal subjects and a control group of cancer patients. F wave changes were the most sensitive indicator of root involvement. Electrophysiological abnormalities were detected in 20 patients, compared with 15 who had abnormal clinical signs suggesting peripheral nerve dysfunction. Electrophysiological studies can be useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected leptomeningeal metastases, and repeated recording of F wave latencies may serve to indicate root recovery in a clinically stable patient."
CD008686,0,4064506,0,Enterogenous cysts of the central nervous system: a report of eight cases.,"The clinical and radiological features of eight patients, five male and three female; with an enterogenous cyst of the central nervous system are reported. The cysts were all anteriorly placed, intradural or extramedullary in situation and their sites ranged from the brain stem to the conus, with a predilection for the lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord. Pain was a universal presenting symptom of the intraspinal cases with a varying degree of motor deficit. Three patients, two of whom also had congenital anomalies of the axial skeleton, showed localised expansion of the spinal canal. The site and size of all the spinal cysts were demonstrated by myelography. Computed tomography of the spine with intrathecal contrast medium was performed on two patients and shown to be of particular value in demonstrating recurrence. Three patients on long-term follow-up had a recurrence of the cyst at the original site. Our findings are discussed with reference to the previous literature."
CD008686,0,4016592,0,Pitfalls of incomplete myelography with thoracic spinal lesions.,"This paper describes four patients with thoracic spinal lesions in whom the initial clinical presentation was highlighted by complaints in the lower back and lower extremities, in the absence of thoracic spinal or radicular symptoms. Initial myelography, confined to the lumbar region, failed to reveal a cause for the patients' symptoms. Subsequently, diagnostic consideration of a thoracic spinal lesion prompted repeat myelography of the thoracic region which demonstrated a relevant lesion in each case. It is important to visualize the thoracic cord when myelography is performed for the investigation of pain or neurological symptoms in the lower back or lower extremities."
CD008686,0,2983865,0,"Frequency, diagnosis, and prognosis of spinal cord compression in small cell bronchogenic carcinoma. A review of 817 consecutive patients.","A retrospective review of 817 consecutive patients with small cell bronchogenic carcinoma disclosed 29 cases of spinal cord compression (frequency, 3.5%). Twelve patients (group 1) presented with symptom of cord compression, whereas the remaining 17 patients (group 2) developed this complication during therapy. Clinical features differed in the two groups: pain was present in 83% of the patients in group 1 and in 47% of those in group 2. Pain preceded motor dysfunction in 75% and 12% of the two groups, respectively. Radiologic bone destruction of the spine was found in 11 of 12 patients in group 1 and in 3 of 16 patients in group 2. Myelography was performed in 8 patients in group 1 and in 14 patients from group 2. A complete block was found in seven and none of the patients in each of the two groups, respectively. Treatment with irradiation and/or laminectomy rarely resulted in a significant improvement of preexisting neurologic impairment but it frequently prevented the progression of symptoms, leading to preservation of sphincter control and ambulatory function in eight of nine and seven of eight patients, respectively. Careful evaluation is mandatory for patients presenting with back pain and radiographic evidence of bone destruction, as 11 of 26 such patients were found to have spinal cord compression. It is concluded that spinal cord compression presents in two distinct ways. One with early onset, pain, evidence of bone destruction, and complete myelographic block. The second is characterized by motor impairment with no evidence of bone destruction and only partial myelographic block. Treatment rarely ameliorates symptoms but prevents deterioration, making early diagnosis important."
CD008686,0,2983051,0,Neurological manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS): experience at UCSF and review of the literature.,"In this review of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the authors have evaluated a total of 352 homosexual patients with AIDS or generalized lymphadenopathy managed at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), between 1979 and 1984. Of an initial unselected group of 318 patients, 124 (39%) were neurologically symptomatic, and one-third already had their neurological complaints at the time of presentation. An additional 210 AIDS patients with neurological symptoms have been reported in the literature. Thus, a total of 366 neurologically symptomatic patients with AIDS or lymphadenopathy are reviewed. Central nervous system (CNS) complications, encountered in 315 patients, included the following viral syndromes: subacute encephalitis (54), atypical aseptic meningitis (21), herpes simplex encephalitis (nine), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (six), viral myelitis (three), and varicella-zoster encephalitis (one). Non-viral infections were caused by Toxoplasma gondii (103), Cryptococcus neoformans (41), Candida albicans (six), Mycobacteria (six), Treponema pallidum (two), coccidioidomycosis (one), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (one), Aspergillus fumigatus (one), and Escherichia coli (one). Neoplasms included primary CNS lymphoma (15), systemic lymphoma with CNS involvement (12), and metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma (three). Cerebrovascular complications were seen in four patients with hemorrhage and five with infarction. Five patients in the UCSF series had multiple intracranial pathologies, including two cases of simultaneous Toxoplasma gondii infections and primary CNS lymphoma, two cases of coexistent Toxoplasma gondii and viral infections, and one case of combined Toxoplasma gondii and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cranial or peripheral nerve complications, seen in 51 patients, included cranial nerve syndromes secondary to chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (five), lymphoma (five), and Bell's palsy (five). Peripheral nerve syndromes included chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (12), distal symmetrical neuropathy (13), herpes zoster radiculitis (six), persistent myalgias (two), myopathy (two), and polymyositis (one). In light of the protean behavior of AIDS and the problems related to the clinical, radiological, and serological diagnosis of the unusual and varied associated nervous system diseases, patients with AIDS and neurological complaints require a rigorous and detailed evaluation. The authors' experience suggests that biopsy of all CNS space-occupying lesions should be performed for tissue diagnosis prior to the institution of other therapies."
CD008686,0,4004281,0,[Phase I study of recombinant human interferon alpha A (Ro 22-8181) in patients with malignant tumors].,"A clinical Phase I study of recombinant human interferon alpha A (Ro 22-8181) was performed in patients with malignant tumors; twenty of them received an American product and seven others a domestic product. Both products were administered in single intramuscularly injected doses of 18, 36, 50, 75 and 100 X 10(6)U. Main side effects included fever and influenza-like symptoms (headache, chill/shivering, general fatigue, lumbago), and digestive symptoms (anorexia, nausea/vomiting). Numbness of fingers or limbs and somnolence were also observed in higher dose groups, but these symptoms all disappeared on the day of administration or by the 3rd day after administration. Abnormal laboratory findings included leukopenia, granulocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and increased GOT/GPT/LDH, but these returned to normal by the 10th day after administration. The peak blood concentration was correlated with the dose, falling to the base line 72 hr after administration. The American product and the domestic product were nearly comparable in the type and incidence of their side effects, and also produced generally comparable blood concentrations. Furthermore, increased anti-IFN-alpha antibody titer was not observed in any of the patients; and the Prick Test proved negative in all of them. No significant changes were observed in any immunological parameters, either."
CD008686,0,3975812,0,Postoperative lumbar arachnoidal diverticula.,"Five patients with arachnoidal diverticula after lumbar operations are reported. Myelography was performed in all cases, spinal computed tomography scanning in three; three patients underwent surgical treatment with good clinical results. Arachnoidal diverticula are a rare complication of operations on the lumbar spine. Spinal computed tomography scanning is very useful, especially in the investigation of large diverticula and in the radiologic visualization of the arachnoidal stalk. Surgical treatment, which is required in symptomatic cases, results in remission of pain and prevents neurological complications."
CD008686,0,3974002,0,Cystic intra-abdominal testicular torsion in an infant.,"We report on a 3-month-old infant with cystic intra-abdominal testicular torsion. He presented with abdominal distension and pain. Physical examination showed a movable, well delineated mass in the right iliac and lumbar fossae. Exploration revealed that the mass was connected to the abdominal aorta by a thin vascular cord that was twisted before reaching the mass. The histological study showed that the mass corresponded to a testis with cystic formations. The testicular parenchyma was necrotized, although isolated seminiferous tubules were found. The cystic cavities were filled by hematic and necrotic material, and exhibited no epithelial lining. A fibrous layer in continuity with interstitial hemorrhage surrounded the cysts. The twisted vascular cord corresponded to a spermatic cord with dilated pampiniform plexus veins. The differential diagnosis and the etiopathogenesis of the lesion are discussed."
CD008686,0,3973490,0,Primary cervical neuroblastoma in infants.,"We describe three cases of cervical neuroblastoma, each occurring in an infant less than one year old, and discuss the investigation and treatment of these patients. The prognosis of patients with advanced neuroblastoma is poor. By contrast, patients with stage I and II tumours often do well and it therefore seems appropriate for otolaryngologists to be familiar with the clinical features and management of localized cervical neuroblastoma. A history of upper aerodigestive compromise is typical, and in the evaluation of this complaint, the possibility of a cervical neuroblastoma must be borne in mind. A retropharyngeal firm, smooth mass is consistent with this diagnosis and supportive evidence can be obtained from ancillary studies. A biopsy is required for tissue diagnosis and, if possible, the entire tumour and sample local nodes should be excised. This will also relieve airway and pharyngeal obstruction. Complete tumour removal at the expense of major nerves and vessels is not necessary in view of the tendency to tumour regression. We conclude that prolonged disease-free survival can be achieved in infants by the use of limited surgery, with chemotherapy in some instances, and without the use of radiation therapy. Management decisions should be made jointly by paediatric otolaryngology and paediatric oncology teams."
CD008686,0,3966215,0,Neurilemomas of the cauda equina presenting as prolapsed lumbar intervertebral disks.,"Neurilemomas of the cauda equina can present with a clinical syndrome indistinguishable from an acute prolapsed lumbar intervertebral disk. There is backache and sciatica, occasionally after trauma, and straight leg raising is usually limited with signs of L-5 or S-1 root compression. The only distinguishing clinical characteristic is that the pain is worse on recumbency and relieved by sitting or walking. There may be no plain x-ray changes for many years and the tumor is usually at the level of L-2 or L-3 vertebral body. Seven such cases are described in this report."
CD008686,0,4088400,0,[Solitary spinal osteochondroma. Apropos of 4 cases].,"The spinal osteochondroma has been studied in 4 personal cases. This benign tumor unfrequently develops on the spine and even less insolitary. In the 4 cases reported, the sites of the tumor were thoracic (2 cases) cervical (1 case), cervicothoracic (2 cases) which are most frequently mentioned in publications. The tumors were located either on the ""posterior arc"" either on the ""antero-lateral"" region of the vertebral body on the level of the ""costo-transversary"" angle. The clinical manifestations were a growth of a tumefaction, spinal pain and sometimes radicular or medullary neurological signs. The X-Ray image is evident. The best diagnostic procedure is C.T. Scan which determines the exact position and size of the tumor. Surgery is the best treatment. The excision must be large and the pedicule totally removed in order to avoid recurrence. This occurred in one of the cases reported. The osteochondroma becomes rarely malignant. If the tumor involves several spinal segments, post-operative X-Ray investigations must be done for a long period in order to watch out for recurrence."
CD008686,0,4086763,0,Spine problems in emergency department patients: does every patient need an x-ray?,"Two hundred adults with spine problems were evaluated by one examiner in a community hospital emergency department. A patient was considered to have a spine problem requiring evaluation if presenting with pain in the neck or back not obviously caused by a process outside of the spine (eg, back pain in a patient with renal colic); if there was known or suspected trauma to the neck or back; or if the clinical setting suggested spinal tumor, infection, metabolic bone disease, or ankylosing spondylitis. Of the 200 patients, 143 were studied by x-ray films. Six patients (6 of 143, or 4%) had x-ray abnormalities that mandated specific treatment. Fifty-two of the 57 patients not receiving x-ray studies were followed up at 2 months. Thirty-three of these patients (63%) had no x-ray studies in the interim and had improved greatly. Nineteen (37%) had been studied radiographically in the interim, but no abnormality requiring specific treatment was found in any patient. Emergency physicians should be aware that x-ray studies of the spine have low utility for patients whose histories and examinations are benign, that especially for women lumbosacral x-ray studies involve high gonadal radiation exposure, and that selected patients can be managed without x-ray studies and still be satisfied recipients of adequate medical care."

In 2 cases death occurred after 13 days (case 2) respectively 17 days (case 3). Worsening of the clinical symptoms appeared in all cases within four days after myelography. In the first 2 cases inflammatory alterations prevailed whereas in the third case complications probably based on mechanical irritations of nerval and vascular structures. In the 2 lethal cases autopsy offered a prostatic cancer with vertebral and intraspinal metastases respectively syringobulbia and cervical syringomyelia beside an ependymoma of the cervical spinal cord as incurrable complaints. The various side effects and complications after myelography using positive contrast media as well as their causes are discussed.

A clinical investigation of bone pain, specific laboratory determinations for Ca-P-alkaline phosphatase; bone X ray, bone scintigraphy with gamma camera are carried on. In some pre-selected cases bone biopsy performed. A 15.9% of the patients with breast Ca showed bone metastasis. Scintigraphy was positive in a 100% of these cases, pain in 62%, X ray in 41%. The final results of laboratory were discarded since they were not considered reliable. Highly specific positive zones for bone metastasis and benign bone pathology were detected when sectioning the spine in the classical zones. A methodological sequence is proposed."
CD008686,0,3984676,0,[Epidural metastases at the spinal level. Clinical study of 82 cases].,"This is a retrospective review of 82 cases of spinal epidural metastasis. A warning vertebral or radicular pain was present in 85% of the cases. In 33% of the patients, who complained only of pain without any neurological deficit, a complete myelographic block was already present. It is thus of prime importance not to neglect a vertebro-radicular pain in cancer patients, and even in patients without known cancer since the epidural metastasis was the first manifestation of the neoplasm in 30% of our cases. The indications for myelography are defined. The functional result (i.e. ability to walk) after treatment depends on the neurological state before treatment. In our series, total paraplegia was always irreversible. Early diagnosis and treatment are thus very important. The surgical treatment alone is judged insufficient. We were not able to prove the superiority of one of the following therapeutic modalities: laminectomy followed by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. Radiotherapy is indicated in all cases, often as the sole treatment. The indications for surgery are defined; they are based on our own experience and the literature. High dose steroids are indicated as adjuvant therapy."

CD008686,0,3921313,0,The computed tomographic findings in benign diseases of the vertebral column.,"Computed tomography (CT) has revolutionized the diagnosis of diseases affecting the vertebral column. CT effectively demonstrates the bony vertebral column with its intervertebral articulations, its soft tissue contents, and the surrounding paravertebral soft tissues. The vertebral column may be the site of involvement of a wide variety of benign diseases. These diseases may be congenital or acquired and may arise from within the spinal canal, from the vertebrae themselves, or from the paravertebral soft tissues. These lesions may be unsuspected clinically and may be detected incidentally in patients undergoing CT of the spine for nonspecific complaints. The axial projection is extremely useful in displaying spinal anatomy and pathology and, combined with sagittal and coronal reformation, provides diagnostic information not possible from any other radiological modality. More invasive radiological procedures, such as myelography, may in many cases be obviated, especially if shorter segments of the vertebral column are to be surveyed. The CT findings in many cases are sufficiently characteristic to enable a specific diagnosis to be made."
CD008686,0,3887205,0,Symptomatic spinal cord deformity secondary to a redundant intramedullary shunt catheter. Clinical and radiographic features.,"Right arm pain, motor and sensory loss in the right arm and right facial numbness recurred in a 27 year old quadraplegic shortly after a posttraumatic spinal cord cyst (PTSCC) was shunted via a catheter into the adjacent subarachnoid space. Although shunt malfunction was clinically suspected, metrizamide computed tomography (MCT) suggested that redundancy of the catheter had caused deformity of the spinal cord. This hypothesis was confirmed at surgery when intraoperative spinal sonography (IOSS) showed that the spinal cord deformity at C1-C2 disappeared when the catheter was withdrawn. This case shows that new or recurrent spinal cord symptoms may be due to a mechanical deformity of the cord rather than shunt malfunction, that restricting the length of the shunt catheter which is used to decompress PTSCCs is important, and that IOSS is an indispensable tool for visualizing the changes in spinal cord morphology during shunting procedures."

CD008686,0,3833922,0,Lumbar puncture.,"Lumbar puncture has been in widespread clinical use for nearly a century. It is used in emergency medicine primarily as a tool for the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The development of computed tomography has changed the position that lumbar puncture has held in the diagnostic sequence of a number of clinical entities. The procedure is contraindicated if there is soft-tissue infection adjacent to the puncture site and if there are findings of increased intracranial pressure due to a mass lesion. Performance in the setting of a coagulopathy may also be hazardous. The most serious potential complication is cerebral herniation. The commonest complication is postlumbar puncture headache, which is due to CSF hypotension resulting from persistent spinal fluid leakage through the meningeal puncture site. Spinal hematoma, diplopia, and intraspinal dermoid tumor formation are less common complications. Meningitis has been found to follow lumbar puncture in children with bacteremia. The lumbar puncture is a useful test for providing information regarding the cellular, chemical, and microbiologic composition of the CSF. Fluid obtained should be evaluated for cell count, Gram's stain, bacterial culture, glucose and protein levels, and other tests as clinically indicated."
CD008686,0,3155669,0,Back injuries in gymnastics.,"The complaint of low back pain in the adolescent must never be taken lightly. A high index of suspicion should be particularly entertained in a child participating in gymnastic training or competition. As noted in this article, steps can now be taken, particularly if a specific diagnosis is made early, to institute specific treatment with a high likelihood of success. Young gymnasts complaining of back pain must never be passed off as having sustained a back strain or ""muscle spasms"" and treated symptomatically. Persistent back pain beyond two weeks warrants, in our opinion, a complete evaluation, careful history and physical examination, a four-view radiographic assessment of the spine, and, if necessary, bone scans or other more advanced techniques to make a specific diagnosis of the cause of the pain."
CD008686,0,2981417,0,The natural history of lumbosacral plexopathy in cancer.,"We studied 85 cancer patients with lumbosacral plexopathy and documented pelvic tumor by CT or biopsy. Three clinical syndromes were delineated: lower (L4-S1), 51%; upper (L1-L4), 31%; and pan-plexopathy (L1-S3), 18%. Seventy percent of patients had the insidious onset of pelvic or radicular leg pain, followed weeks to months later by sensory symptoms and weakness. The quintet of leg pain, weakness, edema, rectal mass, and hydronephrosis suggests plexopathy due to cancer. CT showed pelvic tumor in 96%. On myelography, epidural extension, usually below the conus medullaris, was seen in 45%. With treatment, only 28% of patients had objective responses on CT and 17% on examination."
CD008686,0,2930871,0,[Lumbar arthrodesis: results after more than 10 years].,"Two hundred and seventy four patients had a lumbar spine fusion between 1949/1971. Seventy-five of them were available for review more than 10 years after the procedure. There were twenty spondylolisthesis, forty-eight degenerative discopathies, six cases of Pott's disease and one benign tumour. All the patients had been treated conservatively before the surgical procedure for an average of 7 years and were still complaining of chronic low back pain. All the cases reviewed had fused. The functional results were not related to the surgical technique, which varied during this period: eight posterior mid-line grafts, seventeen interbody fusions and fifty combined anterior and posterior approaches sometimes used because of a primary failure of fusion and no postero-lateral fusions. The average follow-up was 13 years with a range from 10 to 26 years. The clinical results were satisfactory in 74 p. 100 of the cases. There were thirteen failures. Seven of these patients had been operated on before the era of systematic preoperative discography and psychological evaluation and the failure was primary. Other failures were observed at about the tenth post-operative year. The results were better in spondylolisthesis with isthmic lesions, rather than in degenerative spondylolisthesis. They were better in pure low back pain than when the pain associated with sciatica. They were better when fusion was limited to one or two levels. Radiographs ten years after the procedure frequently showed evidence of degenerative lesions of the disc above the level of the fusion and, at the same time, some slipping of the upper vertebra. Fortunately, there was no correlation between the radiological appearances and the clinical results."
CD008686,0,2581426,0,[Clinical evaluation of surgical treatment for benign prostatic hypertrophy].,"Prostatectomy was performed on 300 patients at our Hospital for the period of 5 years from January 1978 to December 1982. Among those cases, clinical evaluation was made on 290 patients whose medical records were available. Ages of the subjects ranged from 53 to 92 years with an average age at 71.6. Retropubic prostatectomy (RPP) was performed on 81 cases, and suprapubic prostatectomy (SPP) and transurethral resection of prostate (TUR) on 39 and 170 cases, respectively. Surgery was made on 206 cases under epidural anesthesia, 82 cases under spinal anesthesia, and 2 cases under general anesthesia. Preoperative laboratory tests showed abnormalities in 62% of the total. The most frequent preoperative complications were circulatory abnormality and urinary tract infection. Average surgical time was 78.6 min. for RPP, 69.8 min. for SPP, and 76.9 min. for TUR. Average blood volume transfused during operation was 446.3 ml for RPP, 430.8 ml for SPP, and 80.7 ml for TUR. Average period of catheter retention after surgery was 9.2 days for RPP, 10.1 days for SPP, and 4.9 days for TUR. Average postoperative admission period was 18.6 days for RPP, 20.6 days for SPP, and 14.1 days for TUR. Average weight of the isolated adenoma was 41.8 g for RPP, 30.2 g for SPP, 11.5 g for TUR. Postoperative complications such as epididymitis, traumatic infection, and hepatic dysfunction were often found. Latent prostatic carcinoma found in the isolated adenoma was found in 11 cases (3.8%). The presence of anomalies in preoperative laboratory findings did not influence the frequency of postoperative complications."
CD008686,0,6522889,0,[A case of multiple myeloma treated with long-term peritoneal dialysis].,"A 54-year-old female was admitted to our hospital in November 1979 with a history of lumbago and proteinuria. She was diagnosed as suffering from chronic renal failure (CRF) due to multiple myeloma (Bence-Jones kappa type). Intermittent COP therapy (a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone) and peritoneal dialysis were started. Her clinical condition was improved and well controlled by peritoneal dialysis over a period of 26 months until she died of pneumonia. Renal failure due to multiple myeloma has been a very poor prognosis. Hemodialysis has been used for renal failure much more frequently than peritoneal dialysis. In this case, control of chronic renal failure due to multiple myeloma with peritoneal dialysis was successfully performed over a long period of time. Peritoneal dialysis, therefore, may be an effective therapy for CRF due to multiple myeloma."

These cases could be divided into two groups by the relative level of conus medullaris to that of L3 body, i.e. 34 cases in which the conus medullaris is tethered below the superior border of L3 body were classified into low placed conus medullaris (LPCM) and 43 in which the conus medullaris is located above the same level into the tight filum terminale (TFT). As to symptoms and signs, incontinence, gait disturbance, foot and toe deformities, lumbosacral tumor and sacral dimple were seen more often in the LPCM group. On the other hand, nocturia, pain in the back and in the lower limbs, positive Lasègue sign and tight back were seen more often in the TFT group. Neurological signs were seen more often in the LPCM group. In 3 cases of LPCM, and 10 of TFT, spina bifida was not visualized on the plain X-ray film of the spinal column. LPCM could be definitively diagnosed by myelography taken with the patient lying in the supine position, on the other hand myelography did not always give definitive diagnosis of TFT. Surgery for releasing the tethering conus was carried out in 58 of 77 cases. Of which 49 have been followed up more than 2 months after operation. Some degree of improvement of various symptomes and signs, was noted in 35 (68%) of these patients."

In 31 patients in whom x-ray findings had suggested spondylitis, fine-needle aspiration biopsy showed the presence of a tumour in three patients. Of 61 patients with radiographic findings suggestive of malignancy, 26 had benign unspecific lesions, and 35 patients had neoplastic lesions. There were four false negative cytological reports and one false positive report. Additional ESR determination was of no clinical value. There were no complications. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of bone lesions is recommended as an easy, safe and very often a valuable diagnostic complement."

Funduscopic examination revealed disc swelling, tortuous veins and superficial retinal hemorrhages simulating early hyperviscosity syndrome. Clinical investigation and computerized tomography, however, indicated that an intracranial plasmacytoma was the cause of his papilledema. Cobalt 60 beam therapy and vincristine were added to his treatment regimen. Seven weeks later the intracranial tumour had almost totally disappeared. Symptomatic cerebral compression from an intracranial plasmacytoma associated with systemic disease is uncommon. The diagnosis and management are reviewed."
CD008686,0,6486316,0,Shoulder pain and function after neck dissection with or without preservation of the spinal accessory nerve.,"To compare the difference in the degree of pain and functional disability of the shoulder in patients who underwent neck dissection for the treatment of head and neck cancer, 23 patients with and 12 patients without spinal accessory nerve preservation were evaluated with a questionnaire and a physical examination. In addition, to determine what effect radiation treatment has on pain and shoulder disability, eight patients who had whole neck radiation but no neck dissection were similarly evaluated. The results of this study show that, on the average, neck dissection patients with their spinal accessory nerve preserved have less pain in their shoulders, less functional disability, and stronger results on their physical examination than did those with their spinal accessory nerve sacrificed. It was also found that the patients who received whole neck radiation treatment without neck dissection had little pain, infrequent and insignificant functional disability, and normal strength on physical examination."
CD008686,0,6391195,0,"Paleopathology in an Iroquoian ossuary, with special reference to tuberculosis.","Pathological skeletal remains from the Uxbridge Ossuary (1490 +/- 80 A.D., N = 457) are classified into four broad categories: trauma, congenital disability, tumor, and infection. Traumatic injuries are relatively common (fractures in 5-9.4% of total), considering the date and subsistence pattern of the population. Congenital disabilities and tumors are rare, affecting approximately 2% of the population. Nonspecific periosteitis and osteitis affect 5% of the sample. By far the most common pathological skeletal changes are lytic lesions leading to cavitation of cancellous bone, especially in the lower vertebral and sacro-iliac regions. It is argued that the changes seen and their distribution are most consistent with a diagnosis of tuberculosis. Applying clinical observations regarding bone involvement, it is estimated that a minimum of 26 skeletons were affected. This in turn indicates a very high population tuberculosis incidence. The Uxbridge sample is neither the only nor the earliest Iroquoian ossuary to display apparent tuberculosis (Hartney 1981). The common presence of this disease in some communities and its low incidence in others are discussed in the context of the epidemic wave phenomenon. There is strong evidence for warfare at Uxbridge, and this warfare may have produced crowding, poor hygiene and diet, such that the disease could flourish."

Considered are: psychogenic headache, tension headache, migraine including its special forms, cluster headache, headache associated with giant cell arteritis, meningeal irritation or space occupying cerebral lesions, trigeminal neuralgia and posttraumatic headache. Some less common special forms like the low spinal fluid pressure syndrome or the Tolosa Hunt syndrome are briefly discussed."
CD008686,0,6726388,0,Benign tumors of the foramen magnum.,"The authors reviewed 102 documented cases of benign extramedullary tumors of the foramen magnum treated at their institution between 1924 and 1982. There was 78 meningiomas, 23 neurofibromas, and one teratoma. Approximately 40% of the patients had a normal neurological examination upon first evaluation. The most frequent presenting complaints were suboccipital neck pain, dysesthesias, gait disturbances, weakness, and hand clumsiness. The average time from initial symptoms to diagnosis was 2 1/4 years. The most common findings included hyperreflexia, arm or hand weakness, Babinski sign, spastic gait, sensory loss, and 11th cranial nerve involvement. Based on these cases, an attempt is made to distinguish foramen magnum tumors from other disease entities by a grouping of signs and symptoms. There is no clinical finding that is pathognomonic. Metrizamide computerized tomography scanning and Pantopaque myelography have been the radiographic tests most commonly used to evaluate the foramen magnum. Recent experience suggests that nuclear magnetic resonance scanning will be a very useful noninvasive means of evaluating the foramen magnum region."

The clinical symptomes of this condition are characterized as follows: 1) acute or chronic progressive visual disturbance, 2) ophthalmoscopically normal or oedematous disc in the acute stage and optic atrophy in the chronic stage, 3) central scotoma or inferior hemianopsia in the visual field, 4) good recovery of vision in the cases with mucoceles, occasionally no recovery of vision in the cases with pyoceles, 5) oculomotor as well as abducent palsy and exophthalmos; occasionally, 6) past history of optic neuropathy and nasal operation, 7) few rhinologic complaints, 8) rhinoscopically: swelling, obstruction and/or polyp in the middle meatus, and 9) CT scan showing homogeneous mass in the sphenoid sinus and/or posterior ethmoid cells. The causative factor of the visual disturbance due to pyoceles might be caused not only by compression but also by inflammatory infiltration and vascular disturbance. Recurrence of rhinogenous optic neuropathy is frequent."

Laboratory tests showed markedly increased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (600 ng/ml) and tomography demonstrated osteolytic lesion of the 5th lumbar vertebra and right scapula. Needle biopsy of the 5th lumbar vertebra revealed only necrotic tissue pathologically. Liver scan and whole body CT did not show any abnormality except for a right renal mass. Hypervascular tumor at the lower pole of the right kidney was noted by IVP and selective renal angiography. No pulmonary metastasis was found. The patient underwent transabdominal right nephrectomy. He had a lowered level of AFP (300 ng/ml) on the 17th post operative day. AFP level dropped further to 100 ng/ml after administration of vinblastine and ifosfamide. Lumbago continued without improving, and the patient died at home 20 weeks after surgery due to general weakness. Although we did not perform radiological examination of gastro-intestinal tract or autopsy, we concluded that renal cancer and/or a metastatic lesion to bone produced AFP because of the following reasons. No other tumor was detected by liver scan, whole body CT, laboratory examinations, operation or clinical symptoms. The AFP level was lowered after nephrectomy, and further dropped with chemotherapy. A case of renal cancer with bone metastasis and without liver metastasis, producing AFP was reported in the Japanese literature in 1983."
CD008686,0,6718289,0,Surgical management of torticollis.,"Torticollis is a clinical sign of either CNS or musculoskeletal dysfunction. Thorough clinical and neuroradiographic evaluation is indicated for determination of the source, course, and exact nature of the deformity before a considered approach to surgical management is undertaken. Torticollis of neurogenic origin is managed by surgical decompression of the brainstem or cervical spinal cord when indicated, as in the presence of hydrocephalus, the Arnold-Chiari malformation, syringobulbia , syringomyelia, colloid cyst of the third ventricle, or neoplasms in the third ventricle, posterior fossa, or cervicomedullary junction. In progressive and medically refractory cases of spasmodic torticollis, neuroablative procedures, neuroaugmentive procedures, selective muscle excisions, and radical cervical muscle excisions have been used to control the dystonia. Torticollis of musculoskeletal origin is often secondary to or associated with trauma, although congenital craniocervical anomalies may be a predisposing factor. The primary goals of surgery for craniovertebral or upper cervical spine deformity are reduction of the malalignment; decompression of the brainstem, cervical spinal cord, and/or nerve roots if necessary; and stabilization of the upper cervical spine."

The chiropractic physician should be aware of this malignant tumor and the characteristic clinical syndrome it produces. The physician should furthermore make every possible effort to include the apical region of the lung on any shoulder or cervical spine radiographs performed. By this careful technique and detailed interpretation of the films, the early and accurate diagnosis of a Pancoast tumor with appropriate referral can be made."
CD008686,0,6713754,0,Abnormal dendritic patterns and aberrant spine development in Bourneville's disease--a Golgi survey.,"Few reports have dealt with the structural abnormalities shown by the neuropil in mentally retarded patients. This Golgi study describes the morphologic changes observed in a brain biopsy from the cerebral cortex of a patient with Bourneville's disease (epiloia). At the time this study was made, the patient was 12 years old and had had a long history of mental retardation and uncontrollable seizures. She, her father, and three other siblings had classic cutaneous signs of epiloia. A biopsy from the right frontal cortex was immediately fixed by immersion, was processed by both H & E and the Golgi method respectively, and examined by electron microscopy. The Golgi-stained material showed a marked fibrillary gliosis at the upper and lower cortical layers, as well as in the heterotopias; the presence of giant cells, closely resembling immature pyramidal cells, with short dendrites growing from their somata and bearing few spines; some other large cells having features compatible with astrocytes; spiral-like glial processes converging upon distorted apical dendrites; these and some other neuronoglial formations establishing specialized anatomical contacts; unorderly arrangement of small and large pyramids within an abnormally compact cortex; abnormal dendritic growths at the level of dendrite bifurcations; and several aberrant patterns of spine morphology, including the megaspine. This first application of the Golgi method to the study of neuropathologic features of epiloia suggests that a poorly developed neuronal circuitry led to the abnormal brain function observed in this case. The same anatomical substrate may occur in other cases of mental retardation."
CD008686,0,6709153,0,Interdural cyst of the lumbosacral region.,"The purpose of this report is to call attention to the clinical, myelographic, and computed tomographic appearance of a very rare type of dural cyst within the lumbosacral spinal canal. We report this condition in three unrelated boys who presented with symptoms of cauda equina compression. Our experience suggests that these cysts are congenital in origin. Anatomically, the cyst wall consisted of a dura-like layer without arachnoid. There was a small ventral defect allowing incomplete communication with the compressed subarachnoid space. Cerebrospinal fluid-like fluid accumulated within the interdural cyst as a result of this communication. Treatment consisted of obliteration of the point of entry between cyst and subarachnoid space in all cases and partial cyst wall excision in one case. After operation, the two patients who had presented with long-standing sphincter disturbance had partial improvement in function and the child with a pain syndrome was completely relieved of symptoms."

Clinical results and beta-endorphin immunoreactivity in cerebrospinal fluid].,"Chronic implantation of a stimulating electrode in the thalamic relay nucleus (11 cases), in the periaqueductal gray (1 case) and in the internal capsule (2 cases) was performed in fourteen cases which suffered from intractable pain. All these cases could get pain relief at least initial two months. Ventricular fluids were collected before and after stimulation with optimal combination of parameters, and measurements of beta-endorphin were performed by radio-immunoassay. Intrathecal morphine (1mg) injection was performed in eight cases. Cerebrospinal fluids were collected by lumbar tap before and 24 hours after morphine injection. beta-endorphin immunoreactivity was measured by the same method. Pain relief was judged to be excellent if the patient so claimed, and if he discontinued analgesics. Pain relief was thought to be good when it was not completely controllable by stimulation but was sufficiently improved that the patient could do without analgesics. It was thought to be fair when patient could not discontinue analgesics, and poor when patient could not get pain relief. We usually attempt to prevent the stimulation-tolerance by administration of the monoamine precursors , i.e., 1-dopa and 1-tryptophan, on the basis of the experimental observation reported previously. In somatogenic pain patients, the thalamic relay nucleus stimulation was performed in 7 cases (excellent; 3, good; 1, fair; 3) and the periaqueductal gray stimulation in one case (good).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In the light of an analysis of this material the authors reach the conclusion that there are no specific symptoms and signs which could make possible the diagnosis of Tarlov's cysts without contrast radiography of the dural sac. There are, moreover, no reliable data demonstrating that the clinical manifestations in patients with Tarlov's cysts are indeed caused by them since surgical verification demonstrates often other causes of pain."

She lost 12 lbs over that period of time. She complained as well of posterior scalp, left hip, and back pain on initial presentation. Physical examination at the time of admission to hospital showed a middle-aged female in no acute distress. Her vital signs were normal. There was a 1.5 X 1.5-cm firm, tender nodule over the occiput. There was no peripheral adenopathy. The breasts, lungs, and heart were normal. The liver was 14 cm in span. The remainder of the physical examination including a pelvic examination was unremarkable. On admission, the only abnormal laboratory studies were SGOT 106, SGPT 139, and alkaline phosphatase 190. Her chest X ray, flat plate of the abdomen, and mammograms were all normal."

Clinical presentation and treatment.,"The clinical presentation and treatment of 18 cases of osteoid osteoma or osteoblastoma of the spine are described, with an average follow-up of 4.2 years (range three months to 11.5 years). The average delay between the onset of symptoms and definitive diagnosis was 19 months. All patients presented with marked spinal stiffness and a painful scoliosis. The lesion was situated in the pedicle in the 15 patients with involvement of the thoracolumbar spine. A surgical approach allowing direct access to the pedicle without entering the spinal canal or jeopardising spinal stability is described. Surgical treatment afforded immediate relief of pain and an early return of full spinal mobility."
CD008686,0,6464580,0,[Remitting course of tumors of the spinal cord].,"An analysis of 221 clinical observations showed that in 23.1%, spinal cord tumours were characterized by a remitting course. The pathogenesis of remissions was rather complicated and was partly determined by ischemic impairments of the spinal blood circulation and by repeated exacerbations of the spinal pathological process in the medulla. A prolonged remitting course of spinal cord tumours was to a certain degree associated with a marked protective reaction of the body when the growth of tumour cells might be inhibited due to ""biological regression""."
CD008686,0,6441456,0,Benign monoclonal gammapathy.,"The natural history of benign monoclonal gammapathy (BMG) has been followed by repeated studies of patients with M components through periods up to two decades. The disappearance of an M component is quite exceptional--in this material only once. Populations with increase in IgG, IgA and IgM have been studied separately. Slow, but steady, increase through many years may be found without development of myeloma (MM). Rapid transition from a steady state of the M component to progression is rare and usually, but not always, indicates the development of clearcut myeloma. Intermediate patterns are not uncommon and make it very difficult in rare individual cases to draw a sharp line between myeloma that should be treated and the benign state that should only be observed. The cause of pain may be difficult to judge. Osteolytic foci in the skull are usually diagnostic for MM, but vertebral fracture may also occur in osteopenia. It is evident that a period of at least three years of close observation without treatment should be the routine. ""Prophylactic"" treatment of BMG with cytostatic drugs should never be attempted."

CD008686,0,6686667,0,Neuroma pain model: correlation of motor behavior and body weight with autotomy in rats.,"A rat pain model was investigated by examining the correlation of autotomy (self-mutilation) score with motor behavior and body weight change after sciatic nerve transection, encapsulation and neuroma formation. Observations of motor behavior and body weight changes (e.g. feeding behavior) as an index of pain were considered to have several advantages over scoring the degree of autotomy. Motor activity of 14 rats (12 neuroma, 2 sham), measured using a stabilimeter, was compared on a weekly basis to autotomy scores for a total of 7 weeks after surgery. Additionally, body weight of 26 rats (20 neuroma, 6 sham surgery) was monitored for 4 weeks following surgery. While autotomy, changes in body weight and abnormalities in motor behavior were observed after surgery, no significant Spearman rank correlation coefficients were determined for any week and thus no significant relationships were found between autotomy score and motor activity or body weight. However, it was observed that rats after sham surgery gained significantly more weight than rats after sciatic nerve transection. Therefore, these results cast doubt on the validity of autotomy score as the sole index of pain."
CD008686,0,6657023,0,Spinal hemangiomas.,"Three new cases of spinal cord compression due to vertebral hemangioma are reported. The clinical presentation, with spinal pain, radicular radiation, and paraparesis, is similar to that of primary lymphoma, metastatic tumor, and disc disease. If the characteristic plain film changes of vertical trabeculations and striations are present, the preoperative diagnosis is facilitated, but in the majority of cases these are not seen. In some instances, vertebral body or pedicle erosion is present. A myelographic epidural block will be seen on further study. Spinal arteriography can prove helpful. Surgical decompression results in marked neurological improvement if intervention takes place before the onset of complete paralysis. The authors recommend that the diagnosis of vertebral hemangioma be considered in the differential diagnosis of epidural spinal cord compression whenever considered in the differential diagnosis of epidural spinal cord compression whenever a primary malignant neoplasm cannot be identified."

Many radiographs had been negative during the 3 years since symptoms appeared. Small osteoid osteomas were found in the neck of the femur with very little surrounding sclerosis. Clinical examination of the hips was normal. Removal of the tumours cured the symptoms. It is suggested that the numerous non-myelinated nerve fibres in the ""nidus"" of the tumours could have been responsible for this unusual clinical picture."

CD008686,0,6677103,0,[Metastatic renal tumor].,"Metastases of malignant tumor to the kidney are observed rather frequently at autopsy, but rarely found in living patients. Two cases of metastatic renal tumor were found at our clinic. One was a 35-year-old male with esophageal tumor. Five months after on operation for the esophageal tumor, he had asymptomatic macroscopic hematuria and had urological examinations at our clinic. X-ray and ultrasonographic examinations suggested a metastatic tumor in the left kidney. Left nephrectomy was performed. Pathohistological examination revealed a metastatic esophageal tumor in the kidney. Five months after the nephrectomy, right lumbago and macroscopic hematuria appeared. Metastatic right renal tumor was diagnosed with X-ray and ultrasonographic examination. Chemotherapy was conducted, but he died three months later. The other case was a 69-year-old male with left lung cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) who had left partial pneumonectomy . In the second year after the operation, he developed asymptomatic hematuria. After X-ray examinations and 67G -citrate scanning, a metastasis to the right kidney was diagnosed. No special treatment for the metastasis was given to the patient because of his failing condition. He died four months later. Metastatic renal tumors present a worse prognosis than primary renal cancer. This seems to be because the former progresses rapidly after its discovery. When a patient with a previous history of malignant tumors in any organ develops hematuria or lumbago, detailed examinations of the kidney should be performed."
CD008686,0,6641201,0,Computerized tomography in diagnosis of compression of the common peroneal nerve by ganglion cysts.,"A 48-yr old man noted gradual onset of pain, and paresthesia on the lateral aspect of his right leg. The findings were suggestive of S1 root compression. CT of spine was normal. Physical examination revealed a small mass overlying the right fibular head. CT revealed this to be a cystic mass. At surgery a ganglion cyst compressing the common peroneal nerve was found. Peripheral nerves may be compressed by ganglia producing a syndrome mimicking central nerve root compression. CT is the modality of choice for detection of these lesions."
CD008686,0,6619939,0,Distraction rod stabilization in the treatment of metastatic carcinoma.,"Stabilization of the spinal column with Harrington distraction rods and acrylic fusion was the primary form of treatment in a select group of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the spinal column. Clinical criteria included patients in poor general medical condition with intractable pain originating from metastatic tumor involvement in the ventral components of the thoracic or upper lumbar spinal column and minimal evidence or absence of spinal cord compression. After stabilization, pain relief was almost total and sustained, and neurological status generally remained unchanged from preoperative findings without any evidence of improvement of preexisting abnormalities or occasions of rapid neurological deterioration. This form of spinal stabilization may offer significant relief of debilitating pain, lessen the risk of pathological fracture-dislocation of the thoracic or upper lumbar vertebral column, and reduction in the local compressive effects on the spinal cord caused by ventrally situated metastatic tumor."
CD008686,0,6621104,0,Neurogenic tumors of the sciatic nerve. A clinicopathologic study of 35 cases.,"Thirty-five cases of neurogenic sciatic nerve tumors are described. Pain is the major clinical manifestation but may give rise to diagnostic confusion because of its often prominent site far distant from the neoplasm. Nonpalpable tumors are best identified by computed tomographic scan of the pelvis and thighs. Early surgical therapy is advisable. Neurilemomas are treated by simple enucleation with preservation of the sciatic nerve. They rarely recur. For neurofibromas, total excision is often not possible. As long as they are small and neurologically nondestructive, subtotal excision with preservation of the nerve trunk is recommended. When they are large or have caused marked neurologic dysfunction, radical tumor and nerve resection is required. In the usually highly malignant neurofibrosarcomas, disarticulation of the hip joint or hindquarter amputation affords the best chance for cure and should not be delayed once the diagnosis has been established."

Headache and suspected papilloedema were the most frequent reasons for referral. Headache was one of the complaints in 102 patients. Migraine was diagnosed in 22 and suspected in 3 patients. Epilepsy was present in 9 patients and in addition, 1 patient had had treatment for convulsions in childhood. 2 patients had a pituitary tumour and 1 had a tumour in the hypothalamic region. Various other neurological disorders appeared in small numbers. Abnormalities in electroencephalograms (EEGs) were found in 36 patients. Progressive loss of central visual acuity unexplained by retinal pathology as well as bitemporal and homonymous hemianopic visual field defects and also evidence of papilloedema warrant a neurological examination in patients with optic disc drusen."

CD008686,0,6664455,0,[Acromegaly and spinal canal stenosis].,"A rare case of acromegaly with radiculomyelopathy due to spinal canal stenosis is reported. A long history of acromegalic deformity was seen on this 55 years old acupuncture therapist for the last 18 years, while he had developed unusually increased appetite, profuse perspiration and gained weight. Fifteen years ago, acromegalic tendency became prominent and was accompanied by low back and knee pain. In 1974 CB-154 was administered in several occasions beside 4000 rads irradiation to the sella. After radiation therapy was completed his outlook was somewhat improved, although low back pain was aggravated and associated with atrophy of the left lower extremity. The neurological examination at admission in 1980 revealed acromegalic feature, increased DTRs on both upper and lower extremities, dysesthesia of feet and atrophy of the leg muscles in general, mainly due to diffuse atrophy. Patient bended knees due to pain and unable to walk. He had radiating pain in the postero-lateral aspect of the left lower extremity and some dysesthesia of feet, although no specific root lesion was identifiable. Spinal roentgenograms disclosed diffuse ossification of anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments, and marked spondylotic changes. Although the low back pain was impending complaint of the patient, the hypophyseal tumor was advised to remove and transsphenoidal hypophyseal adenomectomy was performed. A good amount of softend tumor tissue was removed however, adenoma found markedly fibrotic. Low back pain and knee were decreased gradually, but intermittent claudication was evident. Acromegaly in association with spinal canal stenosis were reviewed in literature, and the relationship of growth hormone and therapeutic problems were discussed."

During the course of 10 months of illness, she complained of low back pain, so we diagnosed the sacral metastasis by scintigram. Autopsy examination revealed simultaneous triple malignancies of the right ovarian cancer, the sacrococcygeal chordoma, and the thyroid cancer. Histologically, the ovarian cancer was papillary cystadenocarcinoma with widespread metastases. The chordoma invaded the bone marrow of the sacrum. The thyroid cancer was follicular carcinoma without metastasis. This combination is very rare."

Using segmental electroneurographic recording from the autochthonous dorsal musculature--in notice of sensitivation and habituation--could be found a measure for the supraspinal reflex excitation."
CD008686,0,6877566,0,An intramedullary ependymal cyst in a 71-year-old woman.,An intraspinal ependymal cyst of the thoracolumbar spinal cord was found in a 71-year-old woman with a history of right side abdominal pain since the age of 18. The late discovery of the cyst is related to the extremely slow evolution of this type of cyst in the absence of spinal trauma. Etiopathogenic problems are discussed after a review of the literature.
CD008686,0,6870630,0,Chiasmal syndrome in sarcoidosis.,"Four patients had involvement of the anterior visual pathway by sarcoidosis. In two cases recognition of the systemic disease was delayed because only visual symptoms were present. Three cases had evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction, with histologically proved granulomatous infiltration of this region. The chiasmal syndrome in sarcoidosis is characterized by a pattern of blindness in one eye, atrophy of the optic discs, and temporal visual field loss in the contralateral eye with variable degrees of pituitary dysfunction. The condition is medically treatable and simulates the clinical and even the roentgenographic appearance of a pituitary tumor."

The aetiological factors and clinical manifestations were analysed. Nucleus pulposus prolapse was diagnosed in 5 children, in 9 cases neoplasms were found (in 3 cases malignant tumours of the sacral bone, intraspinal tumours in 6 cases); in 4 cases obliterative intraspinal arachnitis, and in 3 cases other causes were diagnosed. With the exception of one child the other ones were in the school-age group. In nearly all cases the onset was insidious. In one-third of children with neoplastic processes the neurological symptoms appeared after injuries and caused initially considerable diagnostic difficulties. In 18 cases disturbances of spinal configuration and mobility were observed. Pain produced by stretching was present in 20 cases. Sphincter disturbances were observed in 6 cases (including 5 with tumours). Motor defects were noticed in all patients, more pronounced in cases of tumours. Patency of the subarachnoid spinal space was without any greater importance for the diagnosis of sciatic pains. Raised protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid was highest in cases of intraspinal tumours, and it was moderately pronounced in obliterative arachnitis, while in nucleus pulposus prolapse the protein level varied. Plain films were of lower diagnostic importance, with the exception of sacral bone tumours and nucleus pulposus prolapse. Of greater importance were contrast medium radiological examinations of fluid spaces."

The iodine concentration given was 250 mg I/ml or 200 mg I/ml respectively. The total iodine never exceeded 2.5 g (8-10 ml). Image quality was assessed in terms of diagnostic value having experience of more than 1,000 myelographies using metrizamide. Picture quality was similar to metrizamide of equal iodine concentration. In 35 patients electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded before and after myelography with iopamidol 250. No changes that could be referred to the contrast medium were seen. There were no adverse reactions to lumbar myelography other than those following the lumbar puncture. In thoracocervical myelography mild and transient side effects occurred in 41 (28.3%). The most common were headache (41 cases), nausea (12), radicular pain (10), and dizziness (five). General seizures and psychopathologic symptoms were not observed."
CD008686,0,6225417,0,Back pain in childhood and adolescence.,"Back pain in childhood and adolescence is not uncommon in general practice. Persistent or severe pain, particularly when accompanied by tenderness, restriction of movement and hamstring spasm, should promote an energetic search for the cause. Among the more useful diagnostic tools--now firmly established and often providing early localisation--is the bone scan. No less essential than before are patience in taking a history and a thorough physical examination as preliminaries to early and accurate diagnosis."

CD008686,0,6222391,0,[Backache and low back pain. Diagnosis and treatment].,In patients with back pain there is only a poor correlation between clinical and radiological symptoms. Therefore the interpretation of radiological findings is only possible with respect to the natural history of the disease. Indication for radiological examination is given for early diagnosis and treatment of malformation of the spine; diagnosis and treatment of functional disturbances of the spine with back- and low back pain and diagnosis and treatment of diseases which affect the stability of the vertebrae.
CD008686,0,6825346,0,"Compressive, invasive referred pain to the shoulder.","The painful shoulder can be the presenting complaint of a wide variety of local, as well as systemic, problems. Compression of the brachial plexus or occlusion of the subclavian vessels caused by narrowing of the thoracic outlet is best diagnosed by a thorough history and physical examination, and by performing the appropriate test maneuvers. Patients who do not respond to an exercise program to strengthen the shoulder girdle may require surgical excision of the first rib to enlarge the thoracic outlet. Referred pain in the shoulder originating from the cervical spine or peripheral nerves can be determined by cervical spine roentgenograms and nerve conduction tests. Neoplasms and parenchymal disease of the lung, and infections of the pleural and subdiaphragmatic areas can refer pain to the shoulder through the phrenic nerve. For those patients with persistent shoulder pain and no discernible musculoskeletal abnormalities who do not respond to standard therapeutic measures, another source of the shoulder pain should be sought."
CD008686,0,6825345,0,Neurologic painful conditions affecting the shoulder.,"Radiating pain accompanied by motor or sensory change, particularly below the elbow, strongly suggests a neurologic etiology of shoulder pain. The patient's description of the pain often is misleading because the shoulder joint has a movable fulcrum, which may be the site of a secondary irritant rather than a primary site. The pain may originate medially in the spinal cord or as far distal as the axillary border of the scapula. Precise identification usually requires myelography or discography in addition to a routine careful investigation. Included in this group are spinal cord tumors, extruded intervertebral discs, foraminal root compression syndromes, scalene and cervical rib syndromes, and various clavipectoral compression syndromes. The most confusing clinical picture results from nerve and vascular involvement, such as with cervical ribs, first rib abnormalities, or scalene muscle disturbances. Identification of specific characteristics of neural and vascular pain may help in the differential diagnosis of these lesions. Persistent neurologic deficit usually requires surgical treatment. Traumatic lesions of the plexus and individual nerves represent obvious causes and also may require surgical measures."
CD008686,0,6236016,0,Myelography--a case for audit.,"The radiographic findings and clinical outcome of 54 patients having a myelogram at the request of the Department of Rheumatology over a period of five years are described. Fortynine of the patients had either clinical features of an intervertebral disc protrusion or chronic back pain of obscure aetiology. Abnormalities which could have accounted for the symptoms and signs were found in 28 of these. Although useful information was obtained in regard to therapy the investigation did not lead to surgical treatment in any of the patients without clinical evidence of lumbar root compression. No unexpected malignancies were found. Morbidity was common, but usually mild."
CD008686,0,6221033,0,Therapeutic progress--review VII. The medical treatment of Paget's disease.,"The presentation of Paget's disease varies from a painful or deforming skeletal affliction to an asymptomatic disorder diagnosed on routine biochemical or radiological assessment. When involvement of the peripheral skeleton by Paget's disease is extensive, the clinical diagnosis is usually clear. Affected bones are thickened and deformed and the overlying skin is warm. Bone pain is sometimes severe and malignant change rarely occurs. The new bone formed is structurally abnormal and is consequently liable to deformity and fractures. Serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations and urinary hydroxyproline excretion are raised. Characteristic X-ray changes are seen. Paget's disease should be treated when it causes skeletal pain and tenderness, or when there are neurological symptoms, fractures, marked deformities, or other complications. New therapeutic agents offer both symptomatic relief and some control of the basic disease process. Simple analgesics should be tried before proceeding to the anti-osteoclastic agents, calcitonin, diphosphonates and mithramycin. All are effective in relieving bone pain and improving biochemical indices. The major advantage of the diphosphonates lies in their oral usage and thus, the number of patients who nowadays require calcitonin is small. The majority of patients should be commenced on a course of diphosphonate therapy (EHDP in most instances), but if clinical response is unsatisfactory calcitonin should be tried. Mithramycin should be reserved for special indications e.g. an elderly patient with severe disabling pain."
CD008686,0,6836160,0,[Problems and disabilities resulting from tumors of the central nervous system].,"100 patients of the neurological clinic of the University of Cologne affected by tumors of the brain or spinal cord, had been interviewed according to a catalogue of disabilities developed on the lines of the WHO classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Two months later, 55 patients who had had a previous disease history of less than 12 months, again reported on the course of their disease and the difficulties they experienced. Most of them in their middle years, the patients studied were disabled to very different degrees, the majority of them experiencing greater or lesser limitations in almost all areas of life. The occurrence of individual disabilities, above all visual impairments, personal care disabilities, of locomotion, manual activity, and disorders of balance, was found to be dependent on patient age and tumor diagnosis, whereas disease duration appeared to have little impact."
CD008686,0,6835501,0,"Computed tomographic, myelographic, and operative findings in patients with suspected herniated lumbar discs.","Fifty patients presenting with a suspected herniated lumbar intervertebral disc were evaluated with sector computed tomography (CT). Excluded from this series were patients with prior lumbar laminectomy or a clinical diagnosis of lumbar canal stenosis. Forty-six of the patients also underwent preoperative lumbar myelography. All patients subsequently underwent laminectomy. In 40 patients (80%), CT was positive. In the remaining 10 patients (20%), it was negative; in this group the myelogram correctly predicted the lesion in 8 (80%). Sector CT correctly predicted the nature of the lesion in 24 patients (48%), was incorrect in 14 (28%), and gave incomplete findings in 12 (24%). CT was most accurate when it demonstrated a disc protrusion as the only finding. In this group, sector CT correctly predicted the operative findings in 24 of 25 patients (96%). CT was less accurate when spondylitic compression was diagnosed. This study suggests that sector CT is a useful test in the evaluation of patients with sciatica and that, when a soft herniated disc is demonstrated on CT, myelography may be omitted."
CD008686,0,6880485,0,[Progressive course of spinal cord tumors].,"The main clinical varieties of spinal cord and equine tail tumors are reviewed. Of 221 cases, the progressive course of the disease was recorded in 76,9%, slow-progressive course was observed in 68,1% and rapid-progressive in 8,8% of cases. It is stressed that in the presence of the progressive course of the disease there may occur different manifestations of the tumorous process of the spinal cord, the examination of which makes it possible to improve the diagnosis, particularly in the early stage of the spinal oncological process."
CD008686,0,6407239,0,Clinical implications of heterogeneity of lumbar and cisternal CSF acid-base balance in physiological states and in conditions of intracranial hypertension.,"Considering the lack of complete agreement of viewpoints concerning the heterogeneity of ABB indices of CSF at various levels along the brain-spinal axis, an attempt was made to elucidate this problem. For this procedure 82 patients suffering from diseases causing increased intracranial pressure and spinal pain were examined. A total of 262 samples of CSF was taken from cisterna magna and from the lumbar region of the subarachnoid space. In accordance with the degree of severity of clinical symptoms resulting from increased intracranial pressure, the patients examined were divided into five groups. The results of examination show irregular differentiation of samples of CSF which is related to the clinical state of the patients examined. On the basis of the law of thermodynamics of irreversible processes and in particular of the law of increase in entropy, clinical implications following from the results of investigations are discussed. Treating the heterogeneity of the ABB of CSF as a sign of thermodynamic imbalance of the living system, the author seems a relationship between the results of examination of the investigated system, its thermodynamic state systematisation, probability, and informative function. The presented propositions are supported, in the opinion of the author, by results of investigations of ABB in CSF in 227 cases of cranio-cerebral trauma, vascular diseases and tumors of the brain."
CD008686,0,6371594,0,Neurosurgery in India.,"This is a brief account of Neurosurgery in India. Prior to 1949, Neurosurgery was being practised by General Surgeons. With the return of Professor Jacob Chandy to the Christian Medical College, Vellore in 1949 modern neurosurgery was born and progressed, and today there are more than 180 neurosurgeons in India. Even so, the ratio works out to one neurosurgeon for every 3,600,000 individuals! Conditions commonly encountered such as hydrocephalus, craniovertebral anomalies, pyogenic, fungal and tuberculous infections of the central nervous system, and fluorosis are being discussed. Stereotaxic surgery for pain, epilepsy, behaviour disorders and involuntary movements is being practised at several centres especially at Madras. Following the workshops conducted by Professor Pia and his co-worker Professor Grote , enthusiasm for microneurosurgery has waxed."
CD008686,0,6320020,0,[Painful sciatic rubbing caused by benign synovioma of the spinal joints. Apropos of 4 cases].,"Synovioma, a benign neoplasm arising from pigmented villonodular synovium or synovitis, is uncommon. It involves the tendons and joints of the finger, ankle and foot. In this study four cases of villonodular synovioma of spinal joints are reported. The authors studied 555 cases of patients operated for sciatica due to herniated disk. Histopathology showed that in four out of 555 cases sciatica was found to be due to synoviomas of the spinal joints. The patients, three women and one man, were between 54 and 70 years of age and each had had a long history of low back pain with episodes of sciatica. Clinical evaluation at the time of surgery showed moderate severity of signs and symptoms. Roentgenographic studies of all four cases revealed osteoarthritic changes of vertebral apophyses, with two cases of spondylolisthesis. The pathogenesis of synovioma remains controversial and its histopathological characterization -hyperplasia VS/true tumours- has not yet been determined. It is possible that the number of recorded cases of sciatica due to synoviomas is small because surgical and pathological studies in patients with sciatica associated with osteoarthritic changes have not been adequately performed. Surgery consists of a large resection of the capsule and ligament including resection of intraspinal extension. Because this study involves only four cases, the first of which occurred in 1977, the possibility of recurrence cannot be evaluated."
CD008686,0,6224295,0,The diagnostic value of bone scintigraphy in patients with low back pain.,"Bone scintigraphy has been studied in two groups of patients presenting with low back pain. In one group of 38 patients suffering ""nonspecific"" back pain, bone scintigraphy and laboratory findings were negative in 24. There were abnormal laboratory findings in all of the remaining 14 and 7 had positive bone scans indicative of clinically significant disease. Selection of patients for bone scintigraphy in this group should therefore be influenced by abnormal laboratory findings and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in particular. By comparison, the bone scans were reviewed from another group of patients suffering previously known malignancy. Out of 138 patients, nearly 40% showed a positive bone scan due to subsequently proven metastasis. Bone scintigraphy was positive in a further 14% as a result of osteoporotic rib fracture and vertebral body collapse. In half of these, it was not possible to exclude malignancy by scintigraphy. The present findings indicate that bone scintigraphy is not a useful procedure in patients with long-standing low back pain who have normal radiographs and normal laboratory findings."
CD008686,0,7158279,0,Experimental cutaneous pain thresholds and tolerance in clinical analgesia with epidural morphine.,"Ten patients experiencing significant analgesia from repeated low-dose morphine injections via an indwelling epidural catheter were studied. One group (n = 5) with acute, postoperative pain was tested for changes in experimental cutaneous pain thresholds with and without clinical morphine analgesia. Three of these patients received intravenous naloxone. The analgesia was reversed in two. There was no significant alteration in any cutaneous modality, including pain, although the postoperative deep pain was relieved. This discrepancy might be explained by the existence of separate subpopulations of opiate receptors at the spinal cord level, which differentiate nociceptive input from the skin and from deep body structures. The other group (n = 5) of cancer pain patients with a permanent epidural catheter was monitored for long-term changes in clinical pain. Signs of tolerance were not seen with an observation period up to 6 weeks."
CD008686,0,7143158,0,Hypnosis and nonhypnotic techniques for reduction of pain and anxiety during painful procedures in children and adolescents with cancer.,"Hypnosis was compared with nonhypnotic behavioral techniques for efficacy in reducing pain and anxiety in 27 children and adolescents during bone marrow aspiration and in 22 children and adolescents during lumbar puncture. The patients and independent observers each rated (scale of 1 to 5) pain and anxiety during one to three procedures prior to intervention and one to three procedures with intervention. Prior to intervention for both groups, pain during bone marrow aspiration was rated as more severe (P less than 0.01) than pain during lumbar puncture. During bone marrow aspiration pain was reduced to a large extent by hypnosis (P less than 0.001) and to a smaller but significant extent by nonhypnotic techniques (P less than 0.01), and anxiety was significantly reduced by hypnosis alone (P less than 0.001). During lumbar puncture only hypnosis significantly reduced pain (P less than 0.001); anxiety was reduced to a large degree by hypnosis (P less than 0.001) and to a smaller degree by nonhypnotic techniques (P less than 0.05). Thus hypnosis was shown to be more effective than nonhypnotic techniques for reducing procedural distress in children and adolescents with cancer."
CD008686,0,7164692,0,[Subarachnoid hemorrhages in primary tumors of the spinal cord].,Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhages and multiple hemorrhages into the tissue of the tumor were diagnosed in 11 (5%) of 221 patients with primary tumors of the spinal cord. The clinical picture was characterized by sudden sharp pain in the spine corresponding in localization to the level of the spinal cord tumor. The stroke-like development of the neurological symptoms alters the classical course of spinal cord tumors considerably and makes it difficult to recognize the pathological process. Vascular disorders predominate in patients with meningiomas of the spinal cord in the upper and middle thoracic segments. The pathogenesis of spinal subarachnoid hemorrhages and hemorrhages into the tumor tissue in primary tumors of the spinal cord is discussed.
CD008686,0,7155328,0,Functional improvement after spinal surgery for the dysraphic malformations.,"Spinal surgery for the various dysraphic malformations is generally indicated to arrest disease progression. The results of the present study suggest that certain clinical conditions and presentations are associated with an exceptionally good surgical prognosis. Sixty-nine procedures were done in 55 patients. The diagnoses included hydromyelia and tethered cord related to diastematomyelia, lipoma, lipomeningocele, previous operation, and thickened filum terminale. The operative results were evaluated for significant functional neurological and urological improvement, as well as for the relief of pain. Pain relief was achieved in 92% of patients with preoperative pain. Significant functional return was seen in 67% of hydromyelia patients. On the other hand, surgical treatment of tethered cord caused improvement in 24% (lipoma) to 46% (thickened filum and diastematomyelia). These results suggest that patients with hydromyelia and patients with a dysraphic malformation and pain have an excellent prognosis after operation. A re-evaluation of the indications for surgery for these patients may be necessary."
CD008686,0,6219505,0,[Osteoid osteoma of the vertebral column].,"The peculiarities of osteoid osteoma of the spine occurring most frequently during adolescence are pointed out and contrasted to the benigne osteoblastoma, based on 5 observations and on studies of the literature. The nidus is usually located excentrically and exceptionally even intrarticular. Two foci may occur side by side or one after another, and the adjacent vertebral end plates may be involved. Spontaneous subsiding of pain is possible. The dorsal portions of the lumbar spine are diseased occasionally under the clinician picture of tight hamstrings, most often, however, with a painful reactive scoliotic position of the spine with the concavity always to the involved side. Spontaneous pain and local joint tenderness do precede the x-ray manifestations for many months. The history of pain prior to diagnosis still exceeds one year in the average. The x-ray findings are extraordinary polymorphe. A high awareness of suspicion ought initiate repeated examinations with x-ray and scintigraph. Lack of pains and disappearance of the reactive malpositions of the trunk may be expected only after resection of the nidus. It's preoperative detection may cause considerable difficulties as well as the correct postoperative histological diagnosis in the absence of the relevant material. The most frequent misdiagnosis is low grade osteomyelitis which has been true with the authors who describes first the syndrome of tight hamstrings."

An unrecognized syndrome of the elderly.,"Three elderly patients with incapacitating back and leg pain were found to have spontaneous osteoporotic fractures of the sacrum. The clinical picture in these three patients suggests a distinct clinical entity of spontaneous osteoporotic fracture of the sacrum (SOFS). This is characterized by severe low back, hip, and leg pain that suggests initially lumbosacral radicular compression, either from disk disease, spinal stenosis, tumor. However, objective mechanical signs more typical of those entities may be absent or minimal in SOFS. Symptoms suggestive of a cauda equina syndrome may be present, but there is minimal or no neurological deficit on examination. Marked sacral tenderness is a hallmark of SOFS."
CD008686,0,7135492,0,Solitary plasmacytoma of the vertebral column. A report of 15 cases.,"The clinical features and the treatment results of 15 patients with solitary plasmacytoma of the spine observed in a 28-year period (1950-1977) are reported. The signs at presentation were back pain in 4 cases and spinal cord compression in 11 cases. Three of these patients had paraplegia. Radiologically, the alteration encountered was an osteolytic lesion in all cases. The local treatment was radiotherapy in 11 cases and surgery plus radiotherapy in 4 cases. In 3 patients systemic chemotherapy was also employed. Seven patients are alive without signs of disease 3 to 9 years (mean 6 years) after diagnosis. Eight patients developed multiple myeloma in a period ranging from 1 to 8 years (mean 3.5 years). The relationship between multiple myeloma and solitary plasmacytoma of the spine, as well as the best treatment for the latter, are discussed."
CD008686,0,7077385,0,Intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis. A report of 10 cases.,"The management of 10 patients with symptomatic localized intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis is reviewed. The single most common primary source was carcinoma of the breast (four cases). The initial symptom in nine patients was pain, with five patients reporting a characteristically severe cramping discomfort with radicular distribution. All patients underwent laminectomy decompression. At the time of surgery, six of the patients were weak but ambulatory and four were bedridden. Following surgery, four patients enjoyed some measure of pain relief, seven patients became ambulatory, and three remained bedridden. Two patients achieved a ""satisfactory"" result, and were walking and continent 6 months after surgery. Secondary brain tumors were demonstrated or implicated in nine patients, supporting the concept that the spinal metastases represented tertiary deposits following dissemination via the cerebrospinal fluid. Symptomatic intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis causes a virulent clinical syndrome with poor prognosis and disappointing outcome after treatment. Given the high incidence of associated cerebral metastatic involvement, total neuraxis radiation and/or chemotherapy should be considered when symptomatic spinal metastasis is discovered to be intradural and extramedullary."

Extensive destructive changes were noted in the lower lumbar vertebrae in a 79-year-old man with an aneurysm that had eroded into the spine. The association of back pain with vertebral body erosion requires evaluation for vertebral or paravertebral abscess, neoplasia, and aortic aneurysm. Arteriography is usually required to demonstrate continuity with the vertebral body and to exclude the coincidental association of an aortic aneurysm with another pathology, i.e., neoplasm. Aggressive surgical treatment is recommended for any rapidly expanding aneurysm. The natural history of the untreated lesion is one of rapid demise."

Of these, 21 cases (30.4%) were labelled as ""primary"" spinal lymphomas, with no evidence of any systemic lymphomatous deposit anywhere in the body at the time of surgery. An analysis of their clinical behaviour, treatment, histological classification, and prognosis showed that a (majority of the patients had lower limb weakness and localized pain at the site of lesion as the presenting clinical symptom, b) laminectomy with decompression of the tumour followed by radiotherapy was the treatment of choice, c) histologically mixed histiocytic lymphocytic variety of lymphoma was commonest, and d) six survivors had a histiocytic lymphocytic lymphoma, suggesting a better prognosis associated with this type."

Only two cysts failed to opacify during positive contrast myelography; in both cases Myodil was used and in one of them contrast medium had entered the cyst on delayed films taken at 24 h. Pain was always improved and generally cured by operation, only two patients having some residual backache. There was permanent improvement of neurological function in only eight cases. The factors associated with poor permanent recovery after surgical treatment were: 1) very marked thinning of the spinal cord by the cyst, and 2) relatively longer duration of paresis--only one case had paresis for under 2 years (mean 4.8 years) compared with only two cases for over 1 year (mean 2 years) in those with good recovery."
CD008686,0,7055417,0,Electromyographic evidence of inferior gluteal nerve compromise: an early representation of recurrent colorectal carcinoma.,"Lumbosacral or primary buttock pain and cutaneous anesthesia in the distribution of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve were the initial symptoms in 5 patients later proven to have extensions of previously resected colorectal malignancy. The initial electromyographic impression of an inferior gluteal nerve mononeuropathy associated with recurrent neoplasia was confirmed by a positive colon biopsy in 1 case and widespread pelvic metastasis demonstrated at laparotomy in the 4 remaining cases. Four of the 5 patients also had increased levels of carcinoembryonic antigen. Roentgenographs and other laboratory data were otherwise normal in all 5 cases. Entrapment of the inferior gluteal nerve and the accompanying posterior femoral cutaneous nerves is facilitated by its medial, intrapelvic fixation at its origin from the sciatic nerve and the crowding effect of the piriformis muscle above, the dorsal rim of the sciatic notch behind and the inferior gluteal vessels and nodes below. The demonstration of hypestesia over the inferior lateral buttock and a concomitant history of colorectal malignancy should alter the examiner to the possible presence of an inferior gluteal nerve neuropathy."
CD008686,0,6958958,0,Metastatic epidural tumors in children.,"Spinal cord compression is a rare but serious complication of malignant diseases in children. Epidural cord compression was noted in 81 patients within the past 17 years at this center. The complication developed at different times during the course of the primary disease. For 29 of our patients, cord dysfunction was one of the initial signs of cancer--Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, Hodgkin disease, and malignant lymphoma. By contrast, for most of the patients with osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, it appeared later in their clinical course. The treatment outcome of patients who were paraplegia with complete loss of sensory function for greater than or equal to 48 hours was poor. Only four of 22 in this group became ambulatory. Ten patients with osteosarcoma did not undergo laminectomies because they all had multiple metastases and terminal disease. Paraplegia developed in all ten. There was no difference in ambulatory rates among other patients, with or without laminectomies."
CD008686,0,6809431,0,Growth and hormonal status of children treated for brain tumours.,"The adult survivors of the treatment of brain tumours in childhood are often short. Several adverse factors contribute to the impaired growth of these children including growth hormone (GH) deficiency, impaired spinal growth following spinal irradiation, chemotherapy, poor nutritional intake and recurrent tumour. The GH deficiency is due to radiation-induced damage to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. GH is always the first pituitary hormone to be affected by such radiation damage but panhypopituitarism may occur if the radiation dose is sufficiently great. Preliminary results suggest that GH therapy will improve the growth rate of children with radiation-induced GH deficiency. Additional endocrine complications, which may occur following spinal irradiation, include thyroid dysfunction and ovarian failure due to direct radiation damage to the thyroid and the ovary."

The diagnoses were herniated nucleus pulposus (seven), traumatic dislocation (one), metastasis (one), and normal (three). One patient had a repeat myelogram with a different hydrosoluble contrast medium 2 months after his iopamidol examination and surgery and showed no radiographic evidence of arachnoiditis. The adverse reactions were all mild and transient: headache (four cases), nausea (two), and leg pain (one). There were no diaphoresis, fever, seizures, hallucinations, agitation, or vital sign changes. Electrocardiography, hematology, and blood chemistries were all normal.

CD008686,0,6215590,0,[Cystic dilatations of the subarachnoid space at the lumbo-sacral level. Clinical and therapeutic aspects].,"The cystic dilation of the sub-arachnoidal space individualised by Tarlov in 1938, may be integrated in the diagnosis of non discal surgical sciatica. The classification proposed by Lazorthes sumes up the eventualities encountered at the lombo-sacral level. The clinical study of five personal observations and the analysis of literature enable the establishment of a clinical picture evoking the anomaly. It would appear that the affection is characterised by lumbago or lumbo-sciatica, the attacks separated by free intervals. In an acute period the algia lessens in the Trendelenbourg position. A significant sign would be the pain on moving the sacrum. Among the complementary examination the radiographic study of the sacrum with tomographies is indisplusable, the diagnosis is based on the radiography of spinal nerve roots with late time in a vertical position. Medico-surgical treatment is in order, it gives a favorable result when surgical criteria have respected: invalidating evolutive algia with or without a clear sign of deficiency. The surgical result is essentially conditioned by a strict indication."
CD008686,0,7296479,0,Systemic metastases from medulloblastoma: report of two cases and review of the literature.,"The clinical and pathologic data from two cases of medulloblastoma with systemic metastases, and 101 previously reported cases were evaluated to define better the clinical presentation and natural history. Patients ranged in age from six months to 48 years, with a mean of 13 years; two thirds of the patients were male. Ventricular shunts had been inserted in 20% of the patients. Systemic metastases occurred on an average of two years after the diagnosis of the primary tumor in patients without shunts, but only 1.3 years in patients with shunts. Fifty-nine percent of the patients were known to have experienced recurrence or spread of medulloblastoma within the central nervous system by the time systemic metastases appeared. Ninety percent showed radiologic evidence of bone metastases, of which 60% were osteoblastic. Bones most frequently involved were pelvis, femur and vertebrae; pain was the most common initial symptom. At autopsy, lymph node metastases were found in 65% and liver metastases were found in 28% of all cases in addition to bone metastases in 82%. Lung metastases occurred in 9% of the patients without shunts, compared with 30% of patients with shunts. The average survival was seven months after the appearance of systemic metastases for patients both with and without shunts. Approximately 5% of patients with medulloblastoma may be expected to develop systemic metastases. This development is associated with increased morbidity and a shortened life expectancy."
CD008686,0,6458439,0,Electromyographic findings in patients with low back pain due to unsuspected primary and metastatic spinal or paraspinal muscle disease.,"Electromyographic studies were performed on 16 patients with intractable low back pain and no antecedent history of malignancy or metastatic disease. In each case, electromyographic evidence of severe segmental denervation limited to the paraspinal muscles innervated by the posterior primary rami was found. Subsequent diagnostic studies in each patient revealed a primary neoplasm or tumor metastasis as the source of pain. Applying current knowledge of neuromuscular physiology, the electromyograph may prove to be a valuable aid to the early detection of remote metastasis to the spine and paraspinal muscle structures."
CD008686,0,7304904,0,[Epidural morphine analgesia (PMA). III. Cancer pain (author's transl)].,"The effect of PMA in pain therapy was investigated over a period of one year on 52 patients suffering from terminal cancer. These patients, 22 being outpatients, received a total number of 85 peridural catheters. 75 of these catheters were evaluated according to morphine dosage and effect. The onset of PMA resulted in a drastic reduction in the need for high dose systemically applied analgesics. PMA was also successfully applied in cases with rapidly spreading metastases. Our catheters have remained in place up to 170 days. Side effects were rarely observed. Tachyphylaxis did not develop and almost all patients were satisfied with the therapy. Due to special care of the catheter we observed only 7 cases of infected puncture sites. Our clinical studies have proven that peridural morphine analgesia can be successfully applied as pain therapy in patients suffering from terminal cancer."
CD008686,0,7304864,0,[Epidural application of opiates in chronic pain due to malignoma (author's transl)].,"In 75 patients epidural opiates were applied for relief of chronic cancer pain. In order to avoid local infection during long-term therapy part of the catheter was placed subcutaneously. Different opiates were used separately or in combination with local anaesthetics to define the degree and duration of pain relief after epidural opiate application. Haemodynamic and respiratory parameters, changes in lower extremity blood supply and other side-effects were recorded during epidural pain therapy. Epidural opiate application cause a long-lasting reduction of pain, which may become restricted during long-term or repeated use, especially after a period of systemic opiate therapy. Side-effects, for example slight respiratory depression in the first hour after injection, indicate an initial phase of resorption beeing followed by a long-lasting reduction of pain without attendant symptoms. Keeping in mind certain precautions epidural opiate therapy is superior to systemic opiate application."
CD008686,0,7283572,0,Secondary hyperparathyroidism manifesting as acute pancreatitis and status epilepticus.,"A 36-year-old with end-stage renal disease secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis had a two-day history of epigastric pain and nausea. Soon after admission, multiple grand mal seizures uncontrolled by intravenous phenytoin sodium and diazepam developed. His calcium level was 14 mg/dL and his amylase level was 2,230 mg/dL; lumbar puncture was normal. Hemodialysis lowered his calcium level to 10.7 mg/dL but failed to control his seizures. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was thought to be the cause of his malignant hypercalcemia, and an emergency subtotal parathyroidectomy was performed. Postoperatively, his grand mal seizures resolved. Confusion and aphasia also developed, but they resolved over the ensuing three weeks. Microscopic examination of the parathyroid glands revealed diffuse chief cell hyperplasia. Preoperative parathormone level was 2,196 pg/dL (normal, less than 450 pg/dL). A review of the literature has failed to reveal a similar case."
CD008686,0,7265399,0,Use of lumbar spine films. Statistical evaluation at a university teaching hospital.,"Use of lumbar spine films was evaluated in a retrospective review of 1,095 lumbar radiological examinations in 871 patients. Patients' histories and physical examination findings were correlated with four groups of radiological findings: (1) radiologically normal, (2) incidental findings unrelated to patients' complaints, (3) diagnostic films compatible with symptoms, and (4) radiological findings of questionable clinical significance. The high percentage of nondiagnostic and questionable results suggests overuse of lumbar spine films. Forty-six percent of all studies in this investigation were normal or had incidental findings, and an additional 31.8% had radiological findings of questionable clinical significance. Three hundred seventy-five follow-up examinations (64.2%) demonstrated no radiological interval changes. Radiation exposure and medical cost of noncontributory studies may be substantially reduced by judicious consideration of the potential diagnostic yield of the examination and by careful selection of repeated or follow-up studies."
CD008686,0,7314967,0,[Value of scintigraphy for the early diagnosis of spondylitis ankylosans].,"Quantitative sacroiliac scintigraphy was performed in 33 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 34 patients with nonspecific low back pain, and 30 control subjects. Significantly increased uptakes over the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) were found in patients with AS and in patients with degenerative changes of the SIJ. No significant differences were found between patients with mechanical low back pain by lumbar strain or by degenerative changes of the lumbar spine and the control subjects. But there were 2 of 13 patients with low back pain by lumbar strain with pathologic uptakes over the ISG. Since the scintigraphic technique is not specific, it is necessary to compare the scintigraphic results with clinical and radiological findings in each patient. On this condition sacroiliac scintigraphy is useful in early diagnosis of AS."
CD008686,0,7279135,0,[A case of intracranial hypoglossal neurinoma (author's transl)].,"A case of intracranial hypoglossal neurinoma was reported and the literature was reviewed. A 46-year-old woman with a three-year history of suboccipital pain, dizziness, blurred vision, swallowing disturbance, cysarthria, dysesthesia and weakness of the four extremities, was admitted to our hospital on July 9, 1978. General physical examination on admission were unremarkable. Café au lait spot was not found. Neurological examination revealed nystagmus, ataxic gait and impairment of the finger to nose test on the right side. Atrophy of the tongue with fasciculation on the right side was also noted. Computed tomography demonstrated a round low density area in the posterior fossa which was enhanced with contrast medium. Antero-posterior view of the skull tomography showed enlargement of the right hypoglossal canal. Vertebral angiography and ventriculography disclosed a mass located at the foramen magnum. On July 27, suboccipital craniectomy with C1 laminectomy was performed in prone position. The encapsulated tumor which arouse from the right hypoglossal nerve was totally removed. Histological diagnosis was Antoni A type schwannoma. Postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on August 31. Intracranial hypoglossal neurinomas are very rare and our case marks the 17th reported observation of such a lesion. because of their rarity, complicated natural history and variety of associated symptoms and signs, early diagnosis of these lesions is difficult. Among the diagnostic procedures, computed tomography, vertebral angiography and skull tomography were useful for localizing the lesion. Especially skull tomography which showed enlargement of the right hypoglossal canal could offer very important informations. It should be recognized that early diagnosis by means of neurological and radiological maneuvers mentioned above is essential to good prognosis."
CD008686,0,6455648,0,[Multifocal sarcoma associated with Paget's disease of bone. Effects of dichloromethylene diphosphate (author's transl)].,"A 68-year-old man with old-standing Paget's disease of bone developed in 1975 an isolated sarcoma of the left elbow confirmed by biopsy. The sarcoma responded to irradiation and multiple chemotherapy. In August 1979, pain started along the right sciatic nerve. Clinical examination revealed a tumour deep in the right gluteal region, which was found to be another sarcoma close to the sacro-iliac joint, Cobalt irradiation produced little symptomatic improvement, and the patient died four months later, presumably of metastases. Since January 1979 the Paget's disease had been treated with dichloromethylene diphosphate with satisfactory clinical, biochemical and histological results, but the drug did not influence the course of the sarcoma."
CD008686,0,6453530,0,Early diagnosis of spinal epidural metastases.,"Early signs of spinal cord injury on neurologic examination have been the primary indication to proceed with myelography in patients with possible spinal epidural metastases. With this approach, loss of ambulation occurs in more than one half of the patients. In an attempt to diagnose epidural metastases before the onset of myelopathy, we designed a prospective study based on the development of back pain, a precursor of spinal cord injury in nearly all cancer patients. Eighty-seven patients were studied. A high incidence of epidural metastases was found in patients with myelopathy (78 percent). In addition, patients with radiculopathy alone frequently had epidural tumor (61 percent). In 36 percent of the patients who presented with back pain but who had normal neurologic findings, there was evidence of epidural metastases on myelography; all of those patients had vertebral metastases on plain roentgenogram. Over-all, the plain roentgenogram of the spine correctly predicted the presence or absence of epidural tumor in 83 percent of the patients. Whereas 93 percent of the patients with myelopathy had more than 75 percent myelographic block, this occurred in 53 percent of those with radiculopathy and in only 33 percent of those with back pain and normal neurologic findings. In most cancer patients, spinal epidural metastases are both detectable and significantly less extensive before the onset of spinal cord injury."
CD008686,0,9760979,0,The diagnosis of sacral lesions.,"Clinical courses are reviewed in 4 recent patients with sacral lesions, each of whom was believed on initial clinical evaluation to have symptomatic herniations of intervertebral discs. In each patient pain in the back tended to overshadow radicular symptoms, and sphincteric disturbances were not prominent. Each patient presented some related objective abnormality on general or neurologic examination. The sacral lesion was invariably visible on technically satisfactory plain roentgenograms of the spine and was obvious on sacral tomography. Conventional myelography was useful in defining communication between the lesion and the subarachnoid space, but otherwise typically it was only subtly and nonspecifically abnormal. Computerized tomography (CT) proved to be the most revealing radiographic technique, demonstrating bony detail as well as internal structure and extent of the lesion; in conjunction with metrizamide myelography, CT provided the most definitive anatomical study. The limited utility of angiography in diagnosing these lesions is discussed, as are the respective hazards of and indications for needle biopsy and open surgical exploration."
CD008686,0,7267141,0,The differentiation of organic and psychogenic pain.,"The differentiation between the organic and psychogenic origin of pain is often difficult to establish. One helpful characteristic for the detection of the organicity of a pain syndrome is its consistent change in intensity and/or quality as a function of the motoric behavior of the patient, which can be assessed while taking the history. This observation is illustrated by means of four clinical vignettes. The theoretical background is in accordance with Freud's statement about the real versus the intrapsychic origin of a perception: A perception (in our case, a pain) is real (of organic origin) if it can be made to disappear (to change in intensity and/or quality) by means of a motoric action of the subject (i.e. of the patient)."
CD008686,0,7193827,0,Acute quadriplegia due to bilateral cerebral metastases.,"A 51-year-old man developed severe quadriparesis without sensory loss after a fall on the occiput. When he was treated with corticosteroids, the weakness worsened slightly for 2 days, but he then progressively improved and ultimately walked unassisted. Two months later, postmortem examination disclosed metastatic tumors in the superior portion of each precentral gyrus. The subjacent white matter was edematous. No spinal cord abnormalities were found. The clinical, radiologic, and neuropathologic findings suggest that the quadriplegia resulted from these bilateral cerebral lesions and not from spinal cord dysfunction. The rapid development of cerebral edema, perhaps precipitated by trauma, seemed to account for the acute onset of symptoms in this case."
CD008686,0,7468696,0,Postradiation ureteral obstruction: a reappraisal.,"Thirty-four patients who received radiation therapy for carcinoma of the cervix developed hydronephrosis. Twelve of 34 (35%) had no evidence of pelvic malignancy, and the obstruction was caused by periureteral fibrosis. The incidence of obstructive uropathy due to periureteral fibrosis not associated with recurrent tumor increased when the obstructing lesion was unilateral, the clinical staging of the cervical carcinoma prior to therapy was Stage IB or Stage II rather than Stage III or Stage IV, and the obstructing lesion appeared 2 or more years after the completion of radiation therapy. The appearance of hydronephrosis in association with ipsilateral leg edema, and sciatic pain these patients strongly suggest a recurrent tumor. The diagnosis of periureteral fibrosis should be considered in all patients who develop obstruction of the urinary tract after radiation therapy for carcinoma of the cervix. Laparotomy is indicated if all other methods of investigation fail to confirm the presence of a malignant lesion."
CD008686,0,7452332,0,Treatment of odontoid fractures in cancer patients.,"A series of 18 patients with odontoid fractures due to metastatic cancer were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1974--1980. The primary source of cancer was breast (12 cases), lung (two cases), nasopharynx (one case), multiple myeloma (one case), colon (one case), and rhabdomyosarcoma (one case). The clinical features consisted of severe neck pain and neck stiffness in 17 patients; signs of cord compression were noted in only four patients. Tomography and computerized tomography were useful in identifying both the osseous and soft-tissue involvement by tumor. Initial treatment in all patients except those with myelopathy consisted of high-dose steroids, and immobilization in a hard collar. Ten patients were treated with radiation therapy alone; six patients underwent surgical fusion (four before and two after radiation therapy); and two patients died before completion of treatment. Conservatively treated patients were allowed to walk with the support of only a collar following radiation therapy. We believe that the initial management of patients with odontoid fractures secondary to cancer should be high-dose steroids and radiation therapy, unless displacement is marked. Assessment for surgical fusion should be made following radiation therapy, since conservative treatment may suffice in most patients. Early recognition is important so that treatment can be instituted before C1--2 subluxation becomes severe."
CD008686,0,7207783,0,Clinical and ultrastructural study of painful neuroma.,"A clinical and light and electron microscopic study of three cases of painful neuroma, surgically resected, was made. It was found (a) that painful neuromas contain large numbers of small diameter, unmyelinated fibers, in an apparently much larger proportion than myelinated fibers and (b) that a consistent, unrestrained growth of perineurial cells parallels the constant regeneration of axis cylinders. This results in the unabated formation of large numbers of ""nerve minifascicles"" growing in a chaotic fashion. Degeneration of axis cylinders and/or of myelin is minimal. It is suggested that the increased numbers of unmyelinated axis cylinders in traumatic neuromas could be related to the painful symptoms in some patients. It is further postulated that the unrestricted growth of perineurial cells is an attempt to contain the regeneration of axis cylinders and that the maintenance of perineurial integrity by fascicle ligation is important in the relief of painful human neuromas."
CD008686,0,6162136,0,[Therapeutic strategy in cancer pain].,"Surgical and pharmacological management of cancer pain is described and discussed according to the physiopathological mechanisms underlying this complex syndrome. The therapeutic approach is planned in three mayor phases which may be employed alone or in combination, following an accurate evaluation of the pathophysiology and the clinical pattern in every single patient. The first phase includes multifocal pharmacological therapy by nonnarcotic drugs in order to affect at different levels the physiopathological mechanisms of cancer pain. The second phase is indicated when nonnarcotic drugs cannot achieve complete pain relief; neurosurgical procedures (nerve blocks, rhizotomies, cordotomies, ecc...) are employed in this phase. The pharmacological treatment must be continued and associated to surgery. The third phase includes hypophysectomy, deep brain stimulation, psychosurgery and/or narcotic drug therapy, which are the last step in management of terminal cancer pain when all treatments have been ineffective. The results of this therapeutic program in 188 patients affected by pain of malignant origin are reported and discussed."
CD008686,0,7456447,0,[Primary tumors of the ureter].,"During the recent 18 years 13 patients aged 39-62 years with primary ureteral tumors were observed. The principal clinical symptoms were hematuria, pain in the lumbar region, a palpated kidney. the main diagnostic methods were as follows: cystoscopy, catheterization of the ureter, excretory urography (in early stages of the disease), retrograde ureteropyelography or antegrade pyeloureterography. Only radical surgery--nephro-ureteroectomy with resection of the urinary bladder wall around the ureteral ostium, performed in early stages, yields satisfactory results in 50-60% of cases. Indications to some or other kind of surgery should be formuated on the basis of express-biopsy results."
CD008686,0,7343449,0,Cyst of the conus medullaris manifesting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis syndrome.,"An intramedullary cyst of the conus medullaris was found in a 49-year-old man, who presented progressive amyotrophy in the lower extremities, without root pain or sensory impairment. The clinical manifestation resembled that of ALS, although there were some atypical features, such as urinary difficulty and atrophy in the lower limbs. Myelography demonstrated an intradural oval mass and a laminectomy revealed a cystic malformation of the conus medullaris. Drainage of the cyst resulted in a marked clinical improvement."
CD008686,0,7329873,0,Neurologic complications in prostatic carcinoma.,"A review of 10 years experience with prostatic carcinoma was undertaken with a search for neurologic complications. An unusual case presenting with symptoms of hemiplegia is reviewed. Of 154 charts, 90 provided adequate clinical information for complete analysis. Nineteen cases with neurologic complications were found and were restricted entirely to advanced (stages C and D) disease. Thirty-seven percent of patients with advanced disease developed neurologic complications. The most frequent complaints were related to organic brain syndrome, paraplegia, and radiculopathy. Eight patients developed peripheral nerve or spinal cord injury related to metastatic disease. Five patients suffered metabolic or paraneoplastic complications; three patient's symptoms related to central or epidural metastases and two patients developed neurologic symptoms related to complications of therapy. All neurologic symptoms improved given appropriate diagnosis and treatment. A brief review of the literature is included emphasizing the diverse nature of neurologic complications in this common neoplasm."
CD008686,0,6278555,0,[Neuropathy in angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (author's transl)].,"Four cases of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy associated to peripheral neuropathy are described. The neuropathy was mixed, sensory and motor, more or less extensive, always asymetrical. In two cases, the clinical symptomatology and the clinical course were very peculiar, characterized by sensory disorders of a precise topography, circumscribed and sometimes suspended and by a relapsing and remitting course. In the third case, the neurological signs were acute and rapidly extensive with mandatory respiratory assistance. In this case, death occurred after a few weeks and the exact diagnosis was only attained at post-mortem examination. In the fourth case the neuropathy was very painful but the course was slow. In all four cases marked and extensive pain was present prior to the neurological disorders. Electrophysiological abnormalities were a constant feature with a marked slowing down of nerve conduction velocity. CSF was normal at the beginning in one case but was otherwise markedly pathological with an increased number of cells due to a large number of lymphocytes ranging from 6 to 40 cells while protein ranged from 60 to 160 mg per 100 ml. Nerve and muscle biopsies were non specific, i.e. neurogenous muscular atrophy and demyelination, except in case n. 4 where specific angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy infiltrates were present both in nerve and muscle. In cases 1 and 3 a non specific lymphohistiocytic infiltrate was present in spinal roots and meninges. Corticotherapy was used and efficient in two cases. These data are compared with a review of the literature. Since 1976, 7 cases of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy associated to peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Clinical, electrophysiological and biological features are similar. Only one case underwent a post mortem examination of the central nervous system: a non specific lymphocytic infiltration in the spinal roots and meninges was mentioned. The role of the dysproteinemia associated with the AIL in the occurrence of the neuropathies is discussed. It remains a possible factor only. The role of a massive specific localization of the pathological process is well established in only one case (case 4). Such localization in lymphomas are not unusual. In 2 of our cases as well as in 2 from the literature the pathological findings are non specific: mild lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates of spinal roots and meninges. Those lesions are similar to neuropathies associated to non metastasizing neoplasms or malignant hemopathies."
CD008686,0,6243074,0,Experiences with bone scanning in differential diagnosis of local bone lesions.,"Because some primary tumours often metastasize to the skeleton, their early detection is essential for further therapy and prognosis. Radiographic examination is not sufficiently sensitive for early detection of bone metastases, because it can reveal the typical sign of metastases--decalcification--only after loss of 30-50% of the original amount of calcium from bone tissue (18). Bone scanning with bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals represents a viable technique for early detection of bone lesions, especially early metastatic disease. The indication for this examination is undoubtedly in breast cancer, cancer of prostate, lung, thyroid gland, hypernephroma, melanoma, plasmocytoma and malignant lymphomas. After good clinical experience of the authors with bone scanning in detection of secondary bone tumours in known primary localisations (9, 14, 15, 10), they tried to elaborate in this paper indicative criteria for bone scanning in patients with suspicious secondary tumourous lesions by unknown primary localisations."
CD008686,0,7233900,0,Clinical manifestations of synovial cysts.,"Although synovial cysts are most commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, they may occur in many other conditions. The clinical manifestations of these cysts are numerous and may result from pressure, dissection or acute rupture. Vascular phenomena occur when popliteal cysts compress vessels, and result in venous stasis with subsequent lower extremity edema or thrombophlebitis. Rarely, popliteal cysts may cause arterial compromise with intermittent claudication. Neurological sequelae include pain, paresthesia, sensory loss, and muscle weakness or atrophy. When synovial cysts occur as mass lesions they may mimic popliteal aneurysms or hematomas, adenopathy, tumors or even inguinal hernias. Cutaneous joint fistulas, septic arthritis or osteomyelitis, and spinal cord and bladder compression are examples of other infrequent complications. Awareness of the heterogeneous manifestations of synovial cysts may enable clinicians to avoid unnecessary diagnostic studies and delay in appropriate management. Arthrography remains the definitive diagnostic procedure of choice, although ultrasound testing may be useful."

CD008686,0,6929181,0,Abdominosacral approach for retrorectal tumors.,"The relative rarity and anatomical position of retrorectal tumors may lead to difficulty in diagnosis and surgical treatment. The clinical features and management of 20 such tumors (chordoma 8, neurilemmoma 3, teratoma 3, hemangiopericytoma 1, chondrosarcoma 1, osteosarcoma 1, dermoid 1, lipoma 1, and undifferentiated sarcoma 1) have therefore been reviewed. Low back or sacral pain was present in 18 patients and, although all tumors were palpable on rectal examination, pain had been present for a median of 12 months before diagnosis. Mean tumor size was 9.4 cm (range: 2.5-17 cm). Sacral bone destruction was demonstrated radiographically in all chordomas and three sarcomas, but in none of the benign tumors. Three patients had undergone previous partial removal of their tumors. Surgical resection was carried out using a combined abdominal and transsacral approach in 13, a transsacral approach in the right lateral position in four and transabdominally in three. There was one operative death following secondary operation for chbrdoma. Four of 12 patients with malignant tumors are alive and well at seven months to eight years. One died of a myocardial infarct without recurrence at 11 years. For small benign tumors, the right lateral position permits maximal flexibility for resection either by the transsacral, transabdominal or a combined approach. For bulky or malignant tumors, a combined abdominal transsacral approach in the right lateral position permits vascular control and provides good exposure for protection of vital structures and wide resection."
CD008686,0,7374236,0,[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with liver disease (author's transl)].,"The concentration of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate in the spinal fluid of ten patients with liver dysfunction was analyzed. Ages of the patients ranged from 31 to 75 years. The state of consciousness varied between normality and stupor. After a liver biopsy the diagnoses were as follows: cirrhosis in six cases, porphyria cutanea tarda in one case, hepatic metastases in two cases and Wilson's disease in one case. Mean values in these patients (22.91 +/- 4.18 pM/ml) have been significantly greater (p less than 0.0005) than those in ten control individuals (15.55n control individuals (15.44 +/- 3.66 pM/ml). Values corresponding to two patients in coma were still higher (52.62 and 36.50 pM/ml respectively). A previous lumbar puncture carried out in one of these patients when he was conscious showed a figure of 23 pM/ml. These results suggest a progressive rise of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the spinal fluid in relation to clinical impairment, and may indicate a similar behaviour for this nucleotide to that of tryptophan, as reported by other authors. These findings point toward the role of the alteration of neurotransmitters in the pathogenesis of hepatic coma."
CD008686,0,7375905,0,"[A characteristic, elicited from the medical history, which helps in the differentiation between organic and psychogenic symptoms].",It is often difficult to differentiate between the organic and psychogenic origin of symptoms. One helpful characteristic for deciding the organic origin of a symptom is its change in intensity and/or quality as a function of the motor behavior of the patient. It can be assessed while taking the history. This observation is illustrated with reference to three cases. Its theoretical background corresponds to FREUD'S statement about the real versus the intrapsychic origin of a perception: A perception (in our case: a symptom) is real (of organic origin) if it can be made to disappear (to change in intensity and/or quality) by means of a motoric action on the part of the subject (i.e. of the patient).
CD008686,0,7393804,0,Diffuse involvement of the leptomeninges by tumour--a clinical and pathological study of 63 cases.,"The clinical and pathological features of 63 cases of post-mortem-proved diffuse infiltration of the leptomeninges by tumour are presented. A wide variety of tumours of the nervous system, both primary and secondary, was found to give rise to such involvement, with adenocarcinoma having a particular propensity to behave in this manner. Dysfunction of cranial and spinal nerves, a confusional state and headache were prominent clinical features. Examination of the cerebro-spinal fluid was found to be less useful diagnostically in cases of primary tumours of the nervous system with leptomeningeal involvement than in cases of diffuse infiltration of the meninges by carcinoma."
CD008686,0,7360319,0,[A case of intracranial chordoma with a special reference to the findings in computed tomography (author's transl)].,"A case of chordoma was reported with a special reference to the computed tomography. A 22-year-old female, who had been in good health, was admitted to Kagoshima University Hospital on December 8, 1978 with a chief complaint of diplopia. Physical examination was nothing particular and neurologic examination revealed the left abducent nerve palsy. The labolatory findings including blood count, serum electrolytes, hormonal study, carcinoembrynonic antigen (CEA) and alpha-fetoprotein were within normal limits. Plain skull filsm showed a retro-sellar calcification in combination with a bony erosion of the dorsum sellae and the clivus. The left vertebral arteriography and the left carotid arteriography showed a space taking lesion extended from the retro-clival to the left parasellar region. The axial CT scanning showed a round and irregular high density area consistent with calcification, at the retro-clival area, middle cranial fossa, and parasellar region in the left side, and no enhancement effect was acquired. The coronal CT appearance showed a round but discontinuous high density area like a coral reef, based on the clivus. These CT findings indicated the extension of the space taking legion, clearly. Intra-capsular removal of the tumor was performed and histologic examination confirmed the chordoma. It will be emphasized that CT scan, particularly coronal section was one of the most useful diagnostic procedure of amss of the skull base."

The symptom was originated by: a) bone, in 56.6 % of the cases; b) joints, in 32.7 %; c) skull compression in 7.1 % and spine compression in 3.5 % of the cases. Bone deformities were seen in 50.7 % of patients. Of this total, 41.4 % were localized in femorae. Pathological fractures were found in 16.9 % of patients. Of this total, 44.0 % were localized in femore and 19.2 % in the humerae. The localization of Paget's bone disease in the humerus appears to be specially risky due to the high percentage of fractures found in the present study as well as the frequency of the sarcomatous degeneration described in the literature. Two patients (1.4 %) developed an osteogenic sarcoma in bones previously affected by Paget's disease. It was localized in the tibia in one case and in iliac bone in the other. Frequent associated diseases were osteoporosis, verified in 31.8 % of the patients, arthritis deformans in 28.6 % and nephrolithiasis, verified in 31.8 % of the patients, arthritis deformans in 28.6 % and nephrolithiasis in 12.2 %. Associated neoplastic diseases were mammary cancer in 6.5 % of 77 women and colonic cancer in 2.0 of 148 patients of both sexes. The diagnosis has been made previously or during the period of the present study. The effects of the extent of Paget's bone disease as well as the effect of Paget's skull complication on serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary total hydroxyproline were investigated. Serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary total hydroxyproline were higher in polyostotic then in oligostotic patients although the difference was not significant for serum alkaline phosphatase in a group of 50 polyostotic with skull lesions versus 16 oligostotic with skull lesions. There was a significant increase of serum alkaline phosphatase in groups of 29 polyostotic without skull lesions versus 45 oligostotic without skull lesions (p < 0.001) and in groups of 50 polyostotics with skull lesions versus 29 polyostotics with skull lesions (p < 0.05), and of 16 oligostotic withh skull lesions versus 45 oligostotics without skull lesions (p < 0.02). There was a significant increase of urinary total hydroxyproline in a group of 46 polyostotics with skull lesions versus 15 oligostotics with skull lesions (p < 0.01) and of 25 polyostotics without skull lesions versus 41 oligostotics without skull lesions (p < 0.001), as well of 46 polyostotics with skull lesions versus 25 polyostotics without skull lesions (p < 0.005) and 15 oligostics with skull lesions versus 41 oligostotics without skull lesions (p < 0.02). Although the differences should be referred to a greater number of patients, the results suggest that the effects of Paget skull lesions are more evident on serum alkaline phosphatase than on urinary total hydroxyproline."
CD008686,0,7452052,0,[Haematic pseudo-cysts of the adrenal. About three cases (author's transl)].,"The authors report 3 cases of haematic cysts of the adrenal, discovered in young adults (3 female), presenting with lumbar or lumbo-abdominal pain, sometimes violent, and accompanied by fever. In each cases there was a palpable swelling in the hypochondrium and lumbar fossa. In two cases severe anaemia reflected the amount of haemorrhage which had taken place. IVU with a prolonged vascular nephrotomography time with several views and echotomography confirmed the diagnosis, avoiding the need for aortography whenever possible. The size of the cysts was such that adrenalectomy was necessary in two cases and the extent of adhesions required simultaneous nephrectomy. This is followed by a review of the literature, the dominant features being: the prevalence of haematic cysts which account for 40% of adrenal cysts, the absence of specificity of clinical symptoms and signs and the importance of radiological examinations, and finally the usual absence of any cause even though trauma may sometimes be possible."
CD008686,0,7291842,0,[Paralysis of digestive tract with lesions of myenteric plexuses. A new paraneoplastic syndrome (author's transl)].,"A 67 years old man was admitted on July 1979 for nausea, dysphagia and rectal pain. At age 64 he had undergone radiotherapy on the lower lip for an epidermoid carcinoma. He remained then healthy. His medical history was negative with the exception of chronic bronchitis. He had never been exposed to toxic agents or drugs and had never left Europe. A few days after admission he suffered acute intestinal obstruction but at laparostomy no etiology was found. At the same time the patient complained of pain in all four limbs and he was found to have diffuse wasting of muscles, areflexia and distal sensory loss. No sign of dysautonomia was present. Physical examination was negative with the exception of a cervical lymphadenopathy. The lymph node biopsy showed an undifferentiated metastatic carcinoma. Negative investigations included: blood cells count; serum ionogram and immunoelectrophoresis; thyroid function tests; serological test for Chagas' disease. The following abnormalities were found: ESR: 55-105; CSF protein: 145 mg/100 ml and 1 cell mm3; whole blood folic acid: 1,7 mg/ml; Hbs antigen was present in blood; EMG showed evidence of denervation but motor conduction velocities were normal. By September the patient's weakness had increased and complete intestinal obstruction persisted. At oesophageal, gastric and duodenal fibroscopy no contraction was visible, and biopsies were negative. The patient died of peritonitis on October 5th, 1979. At necropsy peritonitis secondary to multiple perforation of the large bowel was found. No recurrence of the lip carcinoma or metastase or evidence of a primary carcinoma was found. Light microscopy showed no evidence of amyloidosis or scleroderma. Examination of the alimentary tract showed abnormalities restricted to the myenteric plexuses which varied from one level to another. In the small bowel there was hyperplasia of the smooth muscle and the myenteric plexuses were enlarged by marked proliferation of Schwann cells. Severe neuronal loss and nodules of Nageotte were also noted. Schwann cells proliferation was less marked in the stomach and large bowel. Lympho-histiocytic infiltration strictly confined to the region of the myenteric plexuses was present in oesophagus, stomach, large bowel and rectum. Mild chronic inflammatory lesions were also found in anterior and posterior spinal roots and semi-lunar ganglia. The striking feature of this case is the association of an undifferentiated carcinoma and a polyradiculoneuritis with a complete alimentary tract palsy of rapid onset, secondary to lesions restricted to the myenteric plexuses. The low folate level was insufficient to explain the neuropathy. Investigations showed no evidence of the usual causes of intestinal pseudo-obstruction: muscular, dysautonomic, toxic, plexic (idiopathic, familial, inflammatory), Chagas' disease). The clinical course, the pathological pictures of the alimentary tract and spinal roots and the association with a carcinoma suggest that our case may represent a paraneoplastic syndrome..."
CD008686,0,6966810,0,[Lumbar intraspinal tumors seen in a rheumatological context].,"On the basis of a 50 case study, the authors insist on the difficulty of diagnosing lumbar intraspinal tumors seen in a rheumatological context. The increase in pain and spine and spine stiffness at night are the most significant semiological characteristics. A generally slight neurological deficiency is noted in 29 cases (58%) and 21 patients (41%) have a clinical picture identical to that of discal hernias. X-rays of the lumbar spine show signs of bone erosion in 24% of cases. Lumbar puncture furnishes major indications in 85.5% of cases. Contrast testing almost always demonstrates the presence of a tumor. Lumbar intraspinal tumors include a very wide variety of histological types, among which neurinomas, ependymomas and extra-dural malignant tumors are the most frequent."

CD008686,0,509386,0,Intra-arterial BCNU therapy in the treatment of metastatic brain tumor from lung carcinoma: a preliminary report.,"Nine patients with intracerebral metastasis from lung carcinoma were treated with intracarotid and intravertebral artery infusion of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). Four of these patients considered definite responders showed unequivocal clinical improvement and definite decreases in the size of tumors evaluated by neurologic examination, computerized tomographic (CT) scan and radionuclide brain scan (RBS). One patient's clinical condition stabilized with doubtful improvement of diagnostic tests (probable responder). The remaining four patients had further unfavorable progression of the clinical and scan findings and were clearly nonresponders. Complications were transient and included: local pain in the eye, orbit, and occipital-nuchal area during infusion in 7 patients, focal seizure in 3 patients, mild confusion with disorientation in 2 patients, and nausea in 2 patients. Our findings suggest that intra-arterial BCNU therapy may be effective and may be used as an adjuvant to surgery and/or radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic brain tumor from lung carcinoma."
CD008686,0,505265,0,Anorectal abscess.,"A five year retrospective review of anorectal abscesses included 181 admissions in which all but five were explained by the anal glandular hypothesis of causation. Delays in treatment occurred because of misdiagnosis, attempts at nonoperative management and inhospital procrastination. These abscesses are notorious for the recurrence rate after treatment. One-third of the patients in our series had a history of previous abscess and a postoperative recurrence rate of at least 6 per cent. Associated medical problems, such as diabetes mellitus, inflammatory intestinal disease or carcinoma, should be suspected in these patients. The fact that the majority of the patients in our series were afebrile and had minimal leukocytosis is a possible indication that our index of suspicion should be high in any patient with anorectal pain and that we must rely primarily on local findings. Treatment should be prompt incision and drainage under spinal or general anesthesia. Wide unroofing procedures and overzealous attempts at primary fistulotomy are discouraged as is the use of local anesthesia. Associated procedures, such as hemorrhoidectomy, can be safely performed and may prevent certain postoperative complications."
CD008686,0,574210,0,Intramedullary spinal cysticercosis.,"Intramedullary cysticercosis of the spinal cord is rare; there have been only 26 previous cases. We describe a patient with low back pain, paraparesis, lumbosacral sensory loss, and signs of meningeal irritation. The clinical diagnosis was spinal cord tumor, but at surgery there was a cysticercus cyst within the lumbosacral cord. Careful search did not reveal the parasite in any other part of the body. This is the first case of spinal cysticercosis reported in Japan."
CD008686,0,479930,0,Intraspinal tumors in children. A review of 81 cases.,"The authors have presented 81 children with intraspinal tumors, all less than 16 years of age. The clinical features indicated that gait disturbance, pain, and sphincter disturbance are the most prominent complaints. Reflex changes, paralysis, and sensory impairment are the most frequent physical findings. Cerebrospinal fluid protein was recorded in 47 patients and was abnormal in 34. Spine radiography was abnormal in 58% of the patients. Seventy of the patients had myelography, and it was diagnostic in 67. Surgery was performed on 79 patients, with a 2.5% operative mortality (30 days postsurgery). Of the 49 patients who are alive, 91.5% are able to walk. Mean follow-up period was 8.5 years. The authors document the benign course of the intramedullary astrocytomas and suggest an approach to their treatment. They encourage an aggressive approach to metastatic intraspinal tumors. The latrogenic origin of some epidermoid tumors is noted. The importance of early diagnosis and treatment of the intraspinal tumors in children is emphasized."
CD008686,0,114069,0,Craniocervical chordomas.,"In a 20 year period seven cases of craniocervical chordoma were seen and treated. Since it is not possible to completely resect these lesions, the aim of treatment has been to debulk the tumor as much as feasible and employ postoperative irridation. Palliation is the most that can be hoped for, and minimal success in delaying the natural history of the tumor has been achieved. Surgery for relief of symptoms secondary to bulky recurrence is indicated for palliation, as is a repeat course of x-ray therapy. Isolated cases of long-term useful survival have followed doses in the range of 10,000 rads or more [19,20]. This therapy is usually given in smaller increments of an initial dose when there is evidence of recurrent tumor or pain [2]. However, whenever the dosage to the spinal cord or the base of the brain exceeds 4,000 rads, there is a concern about possible permanent radiation damage. These patients are difficult to care for late in the course of their disease when multiple cranial nerve paralysis, long tract signs, and intractable pain become progressively severe. Chordomas usually remain localized; however, about 10% metastasize distally. One case is presented of a large retropharyngeal mass with destruction of the second cervical vertebra that recurred locally in 3 months despite usual treatment; distal bony metastases were found 3 years after initial treatment. The histology of the lesion, its recurrence, and distal bony metastases were essentially indistinguishable from the other lesions that remained localized. Short periods of palliation from severe local pain and exquisite tenderness have been achieved by local resection of the involved bones."
CD008686,0,503522,0,"Ganglioneuroma of the C4, C5 interspace.","Neurogenic tumors in the neck region are relatively infrequent with the exception of those involving the cranial nerves. A case of a ganglioneuroma or neurofibroma involving the nerve root of C4, C5 interspace is reported. The tumor appeared as a mass within the neck with a slight amount of pain in the shoulder and upper arm upon palpation. Surgical exploration revealed a mass superficial to the foramen and erosion of the foramen. Roentgenograms taken in the region demonstrated an extradural mass that was subsequently removed by laminectomy. Postoperatively, the patient did quite well. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Preservation of the nerve should be accomplished if at all possible."
CD008686,0,291386,0,Electromyographic abnormalities in osteosarcoma arising in Paget disease of the vertebral column.,"The case of a patient with low back pain and Paget disease of the L5, S1 vertebrae is presented. Electromyography revealed dysfunction in both the paraspinal and gluteal muscles. Postmortem examination showed sarcomatous transformation of the vertebrae with nerve root compression and skeletal muscle infiltration by tumor. The electromyographic abnormalities are correlated with the pathologic findings. The clinical features of neurologic dysfunction in Paget disease of the vertebral column and in osteosarcoma arising in Paget disease of the vertebral column are reviewed. Electromyography can provide valuable information in the evaluation of the patient with Paget disease of the vertebral column who is suspected of having neurologic dysfunction."
CD008686,0,496615,0,High cervical neurinoma (C1/C2) diagnosed falsely as multiple sclerosis because of trigeminal neuralgia.,"Remitting paresis of the left leg accompanied by left trigeminal neuralgia led to the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in a 46-year-old woman. Over the following 6 years, an incomplete syndrome of the spinal cord developed along with bilateral trigeminal pain. Neuroradiological and neurosurgical exploration a neurinoma located ventrolaterally at C1/C2 on the left side. It is emphasized that since trigeminal fibres descend as far as the upper part of the C2 segment, trigeminal neuralgia should not be considered as an exclusively supraspinal symptom."
CD008686,0,458974,0,Neurogenic bladder and the tethered spinal cord syndrome.,We report 2 cases of the tethered spinal cord syndrome. Early clinical detection of this syndrome in children with bladder dysfunction should be followed by diagnostic myelography and immediate surgical release of the spinal cord. The pathophysiology of the syndrome is discussed.
CD008686,0,157935,0,"[Extensive, diffuse haemangiomatosis of the skeleton (author's transl)].","The roentgenological appearance and the clinical course of a case of diffuse skeletal haemangiomatosis are described. Megavoltage radiotherapy was given to several areas involved, including parts of the vertebral column; the treatment led to an improvement of bone pain and of neurological symptoms caused by cord compression. The differential diagnosis and the suggestion of Karlin and Brower (1977) to make a distinction between ""multiple primary hemangiomas"" and ""diffuse cystic angiomatosis"" of bone are discussed."
CD008686,0,264028,0,Total myelography in the evaluation of lumbar discs. With the presentation of three cases of thoracic neoplasms simulating nerve root lesions.,"It has been our practice to perform total myelography in all cases of lumbar disc disease including the various syndromes of spinal stenosis, because experience has indicated that myelographic abnormalities in the cervical and thoracic areas could have clinical importance despite the presence of gross changes in the lumbar region. Failure to establish a definite diagnosis by restricted lumbar myelography makes it mandatory to evaluate all levels of the spinal axis. Recently, 3 patients with thoracic spinal cord tumors presented with primary signs and symptoms of lumbar spine disorders. Evidence of spinal cord disease was minimal and could be readily overlooked. Total myelography disclosed varying degrees of lumbar spinal pathology, but also showed evidence of lesions in the thoracic region. One proved to be an intramedullary astrocytoma of the spinal cord, and two were schwannomas. The symptoms of low-back pain and lumbar radiculopathy improved after excision of the schwannomas and following x-ray therapy and chemotherapy in the patient with the intramedullary neoplasm."
CD008686,0,430101,0,Clinical data and the identification of special forms of multiple sclerosis in 1271 cases studied with a standardized documentation system.,"In a multicenter study the clinical data of 1271 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were recorded in a standardized manner and analysed by a computer program. Some of the retrospective data are compared with previous reports. The frequency of optic nerve involvement in the present series was close to the Japanese figures. The development of signs and symptoms during the course of MS was given for the 1271 patients and differences in the reversibility of symptoms are presented. In this study, one of the chief purposes was the selection of groups of MS patients with particular symptomatology and course of the disease for prospective, detailed study. The following groups were selected and are under further investigation: 109 patients with an exclusively spinal symptomatology throughout the course of their disease; 441 patients with optic neuritis as initial symptom; 110 patients with early brain-stem involvement; 64 benign cases (duration of the disease more than 14 years and disability not more than 3 according to Kurtzke), 35 malignant cases (duration of the disease under 5 years and disability grade of 7 or more); 83 families with more than one member with MS; 289 females with a history of pregnancy, childbirth and/or use of oral contraceptives. In 339 patients a lumbar puncture was performed at the present examination. The parameters determined constitute a pathognomonic pattern highly indicative of the diagnosis of MS."
CD008686,0,154521,0,Midline prolapse of a lumbar intervertebral disc with compression of the cauda equina.,"Midline prolapse of a disc causing compression of the cauda equina is rare but needs urgent diagnosis and surgical treatment. The onset of bladder and rectal paralysis with saddle anaesthesia should be viewed with a high index of suspicion in a patient with backache and sciatica. Eight cases were seen over a period of five years, and they fell into three clinical groups. Group I patients presented with a sudden onset without any previous symptoms related to the back. Group II patients had a history of recurrent episodes of backache and sciatica, the latest episode resulting in involvement of the cauda equina. The group III patient was indistinguishable from one with a tumour as he presented with backache and sciatica slowly progressing to paralysis of the cauda equina. The prolapse was at the disc between L5 and S1 vertebrae in 50 per cent of the patients, most of whom did not have any limitation of straight leg raising. Urgent myelography and equally urgent removal of the disc within two weeks of the onset of the symptoms resulted in almost complete motor and bladder recovery within five months after the operation in most cases. However, recovery of sensation and sexual function was incomplete even four years after the operation."
CD008686,0,85289,0,Anterior spinal artery syndrome--a complication of cervical intrathecal phenol injection.,"Spinal nerve block by intrathecal phenol-glycerine infusion is commonly employed for relief of severe pain in terminal carcinomatosis and, frequently, a dramatic regional anesthetic effect is achieved. However, nerve block by this procedure may in very rare instances give rise to serious complications. We have seen a case of terminal malignant melanoma in which clinical manifestations, indicative of anterior spinal artery syndrome, developed following the injection of 0.3 ml of 10% phenol-glycerine into the cervical subarachnoid space at the C4--C5 level for the control of severe right arm pain. This report describes the clinical course of the patient over a period of 4 months after the nerve block and the post-mortem findings along with a brief review of the literature."
CD008686,0,762580,0,"Angiomas of the spinal cord: review of the pathogenesis, clinical features, and results of surgery.","Twenty-four patients with angiomas of the thoraco-lumbo-sacral region of the spinal cord, which characteristically occur in elderly men and are situated on the dorsum of the cord, were subjected to surgery after diagnosis by selective arteriography. It is suggested that in this variety of angioma the operation produced its effect by eliminating the raised pressure in the venous and capillary vessels within the spinal cord. There was no evidence of an arterial ""steal."" In all cases, followed up for a mean of five years, progression of neurological symptoms was arrested but, apart from motor disability and pain, any improvement among this already seriously disabled group was small. Diagnosis in the early stages is difficult but the history of mechanical factors exacerbating the symptoms and which occur in the majority of patients should suggest the presence of such a lesion and indicate the need for myelography. Any improvement in results can only come from greater awareness of the condition leading to earlier diagnosis and operation."
CD008686,0,426369,0,Malignant schwannoma: report of a case mimicking lumbar disk disease.,Primary neurogenic retroperitoneal tumors in the adult are rare. This case presentation reviews an unusual history of a patient who presented with pain and neurologic deficits suggesting lumbar disk disease but who was unrelieved by laminectomy and disk removal. Later he was found to have a malignant schwannoma arising from the right L nerve root. Experience such as this reminds physicians that when the result of treatment is not as expected the original diagnosis must be questioned.
CD008686,0,225079,0,Uncommon neurological presentations of tuberculoma.,"The neurological manifestations and autopsy findings of 3 cases of tuberculoma have been described. A cerebello-pontine angle tuberculoma presented with a long history of trigeminal neuralgia. Intramedallary tuberculoma of the spinal cord presented with transverse myelitis, history of one complete remission and a normal myelogram. A tuberculoma of the medulla led to, apart from other features, severe orthostatic hypotension. Tuberculous meningitis, as a terminal process, developed in the first two cases and the third patient died from a vasomotor collapse on suddenly standing up from bed."
CD008686,0,366388,0,[Non-leukemic disease of the central nervous system in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. I. Somnolence syndrome (author's transl)].,"Prophylactic irradiation of the skull and intrathecal application of methotrexate has proven to be highly effective in preventing central nervous system disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin-lymphoma. Prophylactic treatment may be complicated by a somnolence syndrome occuring 4--8 weaks after the end of irradiation. The main features of this clinical entity are somnolence, lethargy, dullness, anorexia, headache, and vomiting. EEG frequently displays a distinct slowing of activity. All symptoms are reversible after 3--49 days. The syndrome clearly is consequence of skull irradiation. Its metabolic basis probably is transient disturbance of myelinization."
CD008686,0,712900,0,Spinal cord and nerve root lesions in children presenting with urinary dysfunction.,"Three cases of bladder dysfunction as the first indication of tumors involving the spinal cord and sacral nerve roots are presented. The correct diagnosis was delayed in each instance. The relationship of such tumors to bladder dysfunction is discussed and the need for careful history and physical examination is stressed. It is emphasized that neurologic disease may present with urinary dysfunction. Neurological symptoms, physical findings and radiographic abnormalities of the spine should be noted."
CD008686,0,739357,0,Cryptophthalmos with an orbital cyst and profound mental and motor retardation.,"The cryptophthalmos syndrome generally consists of cryptophthalmia, dyscephaly (cleft lip and palate, nasal and ear defects, meningoencephaloceles, etc.), syndactyly, and urogenital malformations. This disorder is rare. Approximately 55 cases have been reported, with only a few described in the American literature. A three-year-old boy with this rare syndrome is described. Major clinical findings include: asymmetric bilateral cryptophthalmos, unilateral orbital cyst of the nasofrontal area, bilateral anophthalmos, right choanal atresia, right microtia, right auditory canal atresia, hypodontia, ankyloglossia, cartilaginous synchondroses of the cervical vertebrae, and bilateral acetabular dysplasia. Striking features of this case, in addition to the above, were profound mental and motor retardation. Syndactyly and renal anomalies were not observed."
CD008686,0,697326,0,The prognosis of acute and subacute transverse myelopathy based on early signs and symptoms.,"Fifty-two patients with acute and subacute transverse myelopathy (TM) were evaluated at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1955 and 1975 and followed for 1 to 23 years (average, 5). Nineteen had symptoms of a recent acute infectious illness, 3 had cancer, and 1 had undergone a recent operation. There were four types of initial symptom. Twenty-four patients had paresthesias at the onset of the illness, 18 had pain, usually interscapular, 7 had leg weakness, and 3 had urine retention. Prognosis depended on the nature of the onset of TM. An acute catastrophic onset was generally associated with back pain and led to a poor outcome in 7 and a good outcome in only 1 of 11 patients. A subacute progressive onset over several days to four weeks, generally with ascending paresthesias or leg weakness, was associated with a good outcome in 15 and fair outcome in 17 of 37 patients. Preceding febrile illness, treatment with corticosteroids, and the nature of CSF abnormalities had no effect on outcome. Multiple sclerosis evolved in 7 patients during the follow-up period. Because of the frequency with which mass lesions were missed, the need for myelography in the diagnosis of TM is emphasized. The distinguishing clinical characteristics of TM provide guidelines for diagnosis and prognosis."
CD008686,0,671615,0,Experience with measurement of bladder electrical activity.,A series of patients is presented in whom the recording of bladder electrical activity was performed. There was a significant difference in frequency of the spike activity between patients with upper and lower motor neuron injury. This technique would seem to offer greater clinical application in areas of bladder dysfunction and evaluation of drugs on the bladder.
CD008686,0,308754,0,[Diagnosis of neurinomas of the Gasserian ganglion].,"The article analyses the findings of clinical and X-ray examination in 39 patients in two types of growth of neurinoma of the gasserian ganglion: with localization within the boundaries of the middle cranial fossa (22) and with the formation of tumor nodes in the middle and posterior cranial fossae (17). The first symptoms of the disease were paresthesia or numbness and continuous pain mostly in the zone innervated by the 1st--2nd pair of the trigeminal nerve, absence of corneal reflexes, high lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and protein-cellular dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid. The craniograms revealed destruction of the floor of the middle cranial fossa with involvement of the walls of the f. ovale, spinosum et lacerum and the apex of the pyramid of the temporal bone. Carotid angiography demonstrated typical displacement of the carotid siphon to the midline, to the front, or to the back. The middle cerebral artery was moderately displaced upward and an arched art. chorioidea, anterior was noted. Growth of the neurinoma into the posterior cranial fossa was attended with displacement and deformity of a. basilaris et cerebellaris superior and the veins of the posterior cranial fossa. The ventriculograms showed compression of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle and moderate compression of the caudal parts of the fourth ventricle and aqueduct of Sylvius. Comprehensive generalization of all the findings gained from examination of the patient is necessary in determining the topics and type of the growth of a neurinoma of the gasserian ganglion."
CD008686,0,78975,0,Intramedullary syndrome due to an extradural neurinoma near the foramen magnum.,"A case of right sided extradural neurinoma at the level of the foramen magnum is reported which presented as an intramedullary spinal cord syndrome. Ischemia of the anterior spinal artery or of the vertebral artery was considered to be an important pathogenic factor in the production of the neurological syndrome. The outer part of the spinothalamic tract, where sensory fibers carrying pain and thermal sensibility from the sacral segments are situated, escaped ischemia as that part is supplied by penetrating branches of the pial arterial plexus. The discrepancy between the level of neurological deficit (C5) and site of the tumor (C1-2) was due to distant ischemia. The lack of a history of root pain and the rapid recovery following removal of the tumor also favor a vascular origin for the neurological deficit."
CD008686,0,77320,0,Carcinomatous encephalomyelopathy in conjunction with encephalomyeloradiculitis.,"A man, aged 63, had an illness which lasted 11 months from onset with pain under the left costal margin which radiated to the epigastrium, until his death from cardiac failure. His symptoms consisted principally of parasthesias and proximal weakness of both upper and lower extremities with atrophy of the shoulder and pelvic girdles. He developed pyramidal tract signs, became euphoric, emotionally unstable and mentally retarded. There was no clinical evidence of cerebellar dysfunction. Bronchogenic carcinoma was suspected from a tomograph of the thorax, but, in spite of extensive clinical and laboratory studies, the diagnosis was verified only postmortem. The CSF cell count was high at first but diminished as the disease progressed. Muscle biopsies revealed chronic generalized denervation without signs of myopathy. Neuropathologically, encephalomyeloradiculoneuritis concentrated on the spinal cord was combined with severe rarefaction of the ganglion cells of the anterior horns and with bilateral degeneration of the lateral pyramidal spinocerebellar and posterior tracts. A more diffuse process was obvious in the anterolateral tracts of the lumbar region. Polyneuropathy concentrated in the distal region was accompanied by slight inflammatory reaction in the sciatic nerve. Cerebellocortical degeneration which exceeded physiological age-related rarefaction was also present. The findings are discussed in relation to the literature."
CD008686,0,273143,0,Abnormal CT scans of the brain in asymptomatic children with acute lymphocytic leukemia after prophylactic treatment of the central nervous system with radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy.,"Thirty-two asymptomatic patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, who had received prophylactic cranial radiation (2400 rads) and either intrathecal methotrexate or cytosine arabinoside were studied by computed tomography of the brain 19 to 67 months after initiation of prophylaxis. Seventeen of 32 (53 per cent) had one or more abnormal findings. Dilatation of the ventricles (eight patients) and widening of the subarachnoid spaces (nine patients) were equally distributed among patients in both intrathecal-chemotherapy groups. Areas of decreased attenuation coefficient (hypodense, abnormally radiolucent regions) (four patients) and intracerebral calcification (one patient)--lesions previously described in methotrexate leukoencephalopathy--were found only in those who had received intrathecal methotrexate. Mild central-nervous-system dysfunction was detected in seven patients but did not correlate with the presence of tomographic abnormalities. Nevertheless, these tomographic findings may represent preclinical lesions. The unexpectedly high prevalence of such abnormalities contrasts with the essentially normal tomographic findings in a control group with acute lymphocytic leukemia who received no central-nervous-system prophylaxis. These results suggest that alternative approaches to such prophylaxis be considered."
CD008686,0,647983,0,Hyperprolactinaemia and impotence.,"Clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were evaluated in twenty-nine men who had raised serum prolactin concentrations and pituitary tumours. Twenty-one had functionless pituitary tumours ('prolactinomas') and eight had acromegaly. Supraseller extension was detected in twenty of the twenty-six men who had lumbar airencephalography. Three patients were studied before, sixteen before and after and ten only after pituitary ablative therapy. Seventeen of these men complained of complete lack of libido and impotence and six had impaired libido and sexual potency; only six patients in this series denied reproductive symptoms. Thirteen of the impotent subjects had small soft testes, ten reduced facial and body hair and three had marked gynaecomastia. No features of hypogonadism were noted in the six patients without reproductive symptoms and none of the patients had galactorrhoea. Serum prolactin concentrations were higher and serum testosterone concentrations lower in the impotent men compared with those with normal sexual potency. Serum LH and FSH (both basal and in response to LHRH) oestradiol and oestrone concentrations were not different between the two groups and, except in those with post-operative hypopituitarism, were within the normal range. Following successful lowering of prolactin concentrations by surgery or bromocripitine or both, serum testosterone rose and potency returned; by contrast failure to lower prolactin concentrations was associated with persistent impotence and hypogonadism. The endocrine profile of low serum testosterone concentrations with gonadotrophins which had not risen into the range usually seen in primary hypogonadism (together with the parallel increase of LH and testosterone in one patient studied sequentially during treatment which suppressed prolactin levels to normal), suggested that the impaired gonadal function was caused by a prolactin-mediated disturbance of hypothalamic-pituitary function."
CD008686,0,637189,0,"Giant-cell containing ""fibrous"" lesion of the sacrum. A roentgenographic, pathologic, and ultrastructural study of three cases.","Three similar and unique, predominantly osteolytic lesions are reported in young patients between the ages of 4 and 19 years. Progressive back pain and neurologic deficits were the principal clinical features. The initial roentgenographic impression was that of a malignant tumor either primary or metastic. Despite incomplete resections of a firm, intraosseous and extradural tumor, healing has occurred during the follow-up interval with one interim exception. A spindle-cell stroma containing a variable number of giant cells was the consistent microscopic finding. Ultrastructural studies of one case revealed that the mononuclear spindle cells and giant cells contained cytoplasmic microfilaments similar to those of the myofibroblast. The possible relationship of this tumor to nodular fasciitis and desmoplastic fibroma is hypothesized in the light of the role of the myofibroblast in the fibromatoses and nodular fasciitis."
CD008686,0,644235,0,[Study of 108 cases of cervico-brachial neuralgia: the concepts of idiopathic cervico-brachial neuralgia and cervico-arthrotic cervico-brachial neuralgia].,"On the basis of a series of 108 cases of cervicobrachial neuralgia a study was made of the clinical characteristics, circumstances of appearance, associated neurological signs, sequelae, relapses, and aetiologies of these observations. This series permits consideration of the aetiopathogenesis of cervicobrachial neuralgias of rheumatic origin from a new angle. The disco-osteophytic nodule does not appear to play the role classically attributed to it. Three forms are distinguished: idiopathic cervicobrachial neuralgia of transient occurrence with a cyclic duration and little tendency to recurrence and not related to concomitant arthrotic lesions; long-term cervicobrachial neuralgia lasting more than 20 weeks and always requiring a search for narrow canal and root anomaly -sometimes the form of onset of cervicarthrotic myelopathies; cervico brachialgia caused by cervicarthrosis seen after the age of 60 and consisting of projected pain rather than true cervicobrachial neuralgia, often recurrent."
CD008686,0,627894,0,Liver scintigraphic features associated with alcoholism.,"The relationships between scintigraphic features and clinical alcoholism were studied by review of 2,406 liver scintiphotos. Two distinct patterns were significantly associated with alcoholism: (a) heterogeneous distribution of radiocolloid in the liver, and (b) jointly increased uptake of tracer by the spleen and vertebral bone marrow. A total of 13 overall patterns were found to distinguish, with considerable reliability, alcoholics from all other patients. This finding reflects the frequency with which alcohol abuse is associated with hepatic dysfunction in hospital patients. These observations indicate an important role for the nuclear medicine physician in detection of alcoholism among patients referred for liver-spleen imaging, and they form a basis for comparison with the diagnostic efficacy of other methods of evaluating diffuse liver diseases."
CD008686,0,756026,0,Vertebral metastases and spinal cord compression.,"Clinical interest in spinal compression and resultant paraplegia due to metastases has mounted in recent years. This has stimulated attention to the neuropathology of the condition. 14 cases of spinal cord compression due to vertebral metastases are compared with over 100 traumatic cases. In the traumatic lesions there is central haemorrhagic necrosis leading to cavitation and gliosis with nerve root regeneration in the late stages. In the metastatic cases, lesions are often peripheral, pie-shaped and are related to vascular factors. The neuropathology of cord necrosis due to metastatic spinal disease is therefore different from that caused by trauma. These observations have clinical importance in planning treatment."
CD008686,0,749432,0,[400 intraspinal space-narrowing processes--a clinical study].,"Among 400 observations by the authors, 2 per cent were admitted without and another 22 per cent with slight neurological disturbances. An incomplete transverse lesion of the cord with paraplegia was found in 61.7 per cent, a complete paralysis in 14.3 per cent of the cases. Meningiomas and neurinomas were found in 60 per cent of the patients. The average age of the tumour patients was 43,8 years. Meningiomas and metastases show a tendency to occur in older age groups. The ""Glioma Age"" was around 25 years. The majority of the tumours were located at the level of the thoracic cord. When breaking down according to the kinds of tumours, a different picture is obtained: neurinomas are chiefly located in the region of the cervical medulla and the thoracolumbar region; gliomas are mainly found in the cervical part of the medulla up to the central thoracic cord. A dissociation of the cerebrospinal fluid was found in 90 per cent of the examinations; in 50 per cent of the patients it was above 200 mg%. Within a period of four weeks after the operation, the following results were obtained: 5 per cent free from complaints, improvement in 39 per cent, aggravation in 10 per cent and 46 per cent still uninfluenced. Meningiomas and neurinomas showed the highest degree of improvement. 24 per cent of the patients suffered from transitory rectovesical disturbances, 15 per cent from urinary tract infections, 12 per cent from decubitus, 9 per cent from wound healing disturbances and another 9 per cent from pneumonia. Meningitis was found in 2 per cent. Within four weeks post operationem, the death rate was 10.5 per cent, but this was in the phase before the introduction of microsurgery. On the accuracy of the diagnoses: in 18 per cent the neurological findings were in agreement with the diagnosis and in 49 per cent they showed differences of 1 to 3 segments; in 11 per cent no definite diagnosis could be made. In 46 per cent the native X-ray picture showed pathological changes. Myelography with positive contrast media showed positive findings in 97 per cent and 98 per cent of positive findings were obtained with myeloscintigraphy."

She was running a low grade fever; her general status was not good. At the physical examination she presented:--an amyotrophy of both arms, mainly proximal,--a thermo analgesic dissociation which was complete from C1 to C5 and incomplete from C5 to D4, and--a spastic quadriparesis (with a posterior spinal syndrome). The first physical disabilities appeared 15 months before. The myelography revealed an enlarged spinal cord in the upper part of the cervical region and the contrast media could not go through the foramen magnum. At surgery, a solid mass, localized on the right side, inside the medulla oblongata and the spinal cordal, with a cyst at each extremity, reaching C4 in the lower part and the recessus lateralis in the upper part. During surgery the patient was breathing spontaneously. After the removal of the mass, she presented an apnea. The quadriplegia following surgery was very short. She recovered rapidly a normal motor activity in both legs and in the right arm. Respiratory paralysis remained complete for 2 months. The right diaphragm recovered completely in 4 months, the left one only in part. 4 months after surgery, she went back home. One year later for security reason she still has a tracheotomy. The distal paralysis of the left superior arm is still present."
CD008686,0,655653,0,Epidural spinal cord compression from metastatic tumor: diagnosis and treatment.,"The clinical findings in 130 conseucutive cases of spinal cord compression by metastatic extradural tumors were analyzed. These 130 patients were combined with a previous survey of 105 patients to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) alone with that of surgical decompression followed by RT. Ambulation after treatment was considered a successful outcome. The most common primary tumors producing spinal cord compression were (in order) breast, lung, prostate, and kidney. In 68% of these tumors the thoracic region was involved. Pain was the primary symptom of 96% of the patients, while motor or sensory deficits (or both) were found in 82% of them. Therapy consisted of surgery and RT in 65 patients and RT alone in 170 patients. There were no differences in outcome between those treated by surgery combined with RT and those managed by RT alone. Patients with radiosensitive tumors and those ambulatory at the onset of treatment benefited whether treated by surgery or by RT. Seventy-five percent of living patients who improved from treatment remained ambulatory at 6 months, and approximately 50% of living patients were ambulatory at 1 year. We conclude that RT without decompressive laminectomy is as effective as decompressive laminectomy in treating epidural spinal cord compression from systemic cancer."

Antecedent studies, including roentgenographic, radioisotopic and neurologic investigations, are often initially normal, failing to reveal the underlying cause of the progressive back pain. The present report demonstrates metastatic spread both through the paravertebral venous plexus and by direct extension in contiguous muscle. In this special instance, segmental 4+ fibrillations in the paraspinal muscles are electrophysiologic manifestations of a local, active process of denervation rather than a remote effect of the malignant disease, as has been suggested by others."

More than 50% of them turned out to have acquired encephalopathy. Only gross morphologic brain defects, as visualized by computerized tomography, caused manifest clinical signs of brain dysfunction, such as epilepsy, mental retardation, paresis, and apallic syndrome. Mild morphologic changes were found even in asymptomatic children. The preferred site of defects in brain substance was the paraventricular white matter."

Most endovascular occlusions performed for tumoral processes are presurgical indications, with the aim of reducing hemorrhage at operation. Embolization becomes practically mandatory for nasopharyngeal angiofibromas, considerably reducing the peroperative bleeding. Indications of embolization for meningiomas must be discussed according to the size and location of the tumors: embolization is especially useful in large tumors or those inserted on the base of the skull, mainly in the middle fossa. In chemodectomas, embolization can be used presurgically or on its own when surgery becomes impossible; angiographic follow-up shows that secondary repermeabilization is frequent in spite of clinical improvement. In malignant tumors of the craniofacial region, indications of embolization must be considered with care because failure of vascularization tends to make radiotherapy less efficient; in these cases, embolization can be useful in reducing pain or to contend with cataclysmal hemorrhages."
CD008686,0,146719,0,The spectrum of intervertebral disc-space infection in children.,"Discitis, intervertebral disc-space infection, and vertebral osteomyelitis form a spectrum of disorders with a probably common bacterial etiology. We studied forty-one children who had symptomatic narrowing of the disc space associated with fever and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and found that the diagnosis of infection in the spine was usually delayed. Technetium 99m polyphosphate bone-scanning proved to be an accurate, rapid, and safe method of establishing an early diagnosis of infection. A positive culture of blood or biopsy material was found in 34 per cent of all the patients (half of the patients for whom cultures were obtained). The clinical and roentgenographic picture that develops is determined both by the virulence and extent of infection and by the resistance and regenerative capacity of the host. Discitis in children is a vertebral osteomyelitis with disc involvement."

It would appear that the first manifestation of the lesion occurred three years previously (lumbar pain). Careful clinical examination, numerous radiological studies and two exploratory laparotomies failed to reveal the site of the lesion. The latter was finally demonstrated by GaC67 gammagraphy. This case thus confirms the great value of this radioactive tracer in the diagnostic study of a febrile syndrome as a tumour syndrome. It would appear to be perhaps desirable, in this pathological context, to request a whole body study using GaC67 before proceeding to exploratory laparotomy."

CD008686,0,617050,0,Epidural spinal metastases: factors related to selection of cases for decompressive laminectomy.,"We have treated a selected series of patients with spinal epidural metastatic tumors by dorsal decompression according to principles we presumed would produce the most favorable therapeutic results. There was no operative mortality, and morbidity was minor. In the first postoperative week, improvement in motor function was apparent in 44% of cases. By 3 months postoperatively, 40% of the patients were independently ambulatory and an additional 28% were ambulatory with minimal assistance. This 68% composite compares favorably to the 30 to 40% results in several series of unselected cases. On the basis of this data, it is concluded that consideration of the tumor's histological type, biological history, the host's response, the extent of neurological deficit, the progression of neurological deficit, and dissemination of disease will aid in the definition of those cases with epidural metastases which may be expected to benefit from surgical decompression."

A 24-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with complaints of dizziness and impaired balance. Neurological examination revealed IX, XI and XII cranial nerves and cerebellar involvements, e.g., Brun's-Cushing nystagmus, curtain sign on the left, weakness of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and deviation of the tongue to the left, accompanied with atrophy. Choked discs and other signs of increased intracranial pressure were not recognized. There were no cerebellar symptoms except impaired balance and nystagmus. Lateral view of vertebral angiography showed that the posterior inferior cerebellar artery was displaced backward and upward, the basilar artery was imposed to the clivus, and the superior cerebellar artery was elevated. A-P view of vertebral angiography showed that the posterior inferior cerebellar artery was displaced to the left. Enlargement of the left jugular foramen was revealed especially by tomograms of horizontal section at the level of 0.3 cm below the external acoustic meatus and 0.5 cm behind the external acoustic meatus. The jugular foramen margins were smooth and somewhat sclerotic. We confirmed the diagnosis of the jugular foramen neurinoma on the left. Suboccipital craniectomy confirmed a huge tumor which covered the left jugular foramen and the bulk of which was in the cisterna magna. These findings were supposed to explain that the patient did not show increased intracranial pressure. The tumor was encapsuled with smooth and thin capsule. This tumor was totally removed and the postoperative course was uneventful. Histological diagnosis was neurinoma. We consider that this tumor arose on the IXth or XIth cranial nerve."

In 123 cases extended neuroradiologic examination with myelography of the cervical spinal canal was carried out. A space occupying lesion was found in 59 cases: narrow spinal canal, protruding discs. In 64 cases no pathologic processes were seen radiologically. Comparison of both groups: no differences in clinical signs, history or findings. 2. Tetraspasticity alone was the leading sign in 30 cases. The legs were always more severely involved than the upper limbs. In 70% spasticity was more severe on the right. Further clinical analysis depends on additional signs, particularly paresthesiae, pain, disturbed joint-sense. Among the patients with protruding discs heart-and circulatory insufficiency is a little more common, but in the group without protrusion exogenous/endogenous metabolic conditions(intoxication, malabsorption) and neoplasms. -Protein content of CSF is raised equally in both groups, particularly albumin. This is probably due to reduced circulation of CSF. In 6 patients an internal hydrocephalus was found. 3. No single active causative factor could be found nor any familial relationship. In spite of increasingly extended diagnostic techniques no underlying condition could be discovered. Tetraspastic is a ""polygenetic"" reaction of the central nervous system without a final common path. The cases show that mechanical factors (cervical myelopathy) predispose locally to non-mechanical injuries."
CD008686,0,404108,0,Atypical manifestations of spinal infections.,"Because of alarming delays in the diagnosis and treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis we have reviewed our experience over the past 15 years. Of the 36 cases, 25 were pyogenic and 11 tuberculous. Because of late referral there was a delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of at least three months in 13 patients. The reason for this was the failure of the initial physician to consider osteomyelitis in the differential diagnosis of a febrile illness associated with back pain. The majority of our patients from the onset did not have intense localized pain, tenderness and a high fever which is the classical clinical picture in this condition. Seven patients with a long history required surgical exploration and debridement of the lesion in order to eradicate the infection. The remainder did well on 6 to 12 weeks of antibiotic therapy. None required spinal fusion. Ten of 11 patients with spinal tuberculosis had curettage of the lesion and spinal fusion. Patients with diabetes, malignancy, alcoholism, corticosteroid therapy and recent lower urinary tract surgery were found to be at particular risk of developing spinal osteomyelitis. Very often it was difficult to identify differences in the presentation of pyogenic and tuberculous infections."

Over the past three years, seven patients have been referred to us with a presumable diagnosis of subarachmoid hemorrage. In each one of these patients, the clinical features (an explosive headache, relapsing in three, and a normal neurological examination) together with appropriate laboratory investigations (cerebro-spinal fluid analysis, electroencephalography, echoencephalography, brain scan, arteriography, pneumoencephalography) have ruled out the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage, as well as less common causes of explosive headaches such as ball-valve tumors of the ventricular system, intra-cerebral hemorrhage, hemorrhage into a tumor. In three out of these seven patients, there was no history of migraine. Bening explosive headaches mimicking subarachnoid hemorrhage, occurring in patients with or without antecedents of migraine, are not as unusual as one might conclude from a review of the literature. Proper recognition of this syndrome is important since it might help to sort out those patients with explosive headaches who need not be submitted indiscriminately to risk-fraught procedures."

However, several cases have recently been reported in which extraneural metastases of the tumor were initiated through the shunt tube implanted. The purpose of this paper is to present two cases with malignant brain tumor metastasizing extraneurally through ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and to review the reported cases in the literature. Case 1 The patient, a 9-year-old boy, had been suffering from headache and vomiting for 3 months prior to admission to the Neurosurgical Clinic, Gumma University Hospital. On admission, he had choked discs and cerebellar dysfunction with a staggering gait. The clinical diagnosis was a 4th ventricle tumor. On November 29, 1971, a suboccipital craniectomy was performed. A medullary tumor in the 4th ventricle was partially removed, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt was also performed. Subsequently postoperative irradiation was given, and the symptoms were abated. Histological diagnosis was ependymoblastoma. Thirteen months later, he was again admitted because of visual disturbance, psychic change and pituitary hypofunction. Bilateral frontal craniotomy revealed a large mass over the midline of the anterior skull base, accompanied by numerous meningeal neoplastic deposits. The tumor was partially removed and histologically proven to be meningeal metastases of ependymoblastoma. Irradiation was again given and the symptoms improved. But the 4th ventricle tumor recurred 5 months after the 2nd operation, and then a massive intraperitoneal effusion appeared. Cytological examination revealed clusters of tumor cells in the ascites. The patient died on September 8, 1974, namely 22 months after the ventriculoperitoneal shunt was implanted.

The study contributes to the observation by others that the osteoid osteoma occurs as a scintigraphic 'hotspot'. It is concluded that the diagnostic delay of the osteoid osteoma can be shortened when bone scintigraphy is performed more often and at an earlier stage in patients with unexplained bone pain or with a clinical history that leads to the suspicion of the presence of an osteoid osteoma.
CD008686,0,318989,0,Dantrolene sodium: a review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy in spasticity.,"Dantrolene sodium or dantrolene1 is 1([5-(nitrophenyl)furfurylidend] amino) hydantoin sodium hydrate. It is indicated for use in chronic disorders characterised by skeletal muscle spasticity, such as spinal cord injury, stroke, cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. Dantrolene is believed to act directly on the contractile mechanism of skeletal muscle to decrease the force of contraction in the absence of any demonstrated effects on neural pathways, on the neuromuscular junction, or on the excitable properties of the muscle fibre membranes. Controlled trials have demonstrated that dantrolene is superior to placebo in adults or children with spasticity from various causes, as evidenced by clinical assessments of disability and daily activities, and by muscle and reflex responses to mechanical and electrical stimulation. It is somewhat less effective in patients with multiple sclerosis than in those with spasticity from other causes. There has been a general clinical impression in controlled trials that dantrolene caused less sedation than would have been expected from therapeutically comparable doses of diazepam. In 2 controlled trials, there was no significant difference between dantrolene and diazepam in terms of reductions in spasticity, clonus, and hyperreflexia, but side-effects such as drowsiness and inco-ordination occurred significantly more frequently on diazepam. Long-term studies have indicated continuing benefit for patients taking dantrolene, though the incidence of side-effects has often been high and there has been a suggestion of exacerbation of seizures in children with cerebral palsy. Dantrolene may be of value in the medical treatment of spasm of the external urethral sphincter due to neurological and non-neurological disease, and animal studies suggest a potential use in the management of malignant hyperpyrexia. Chemical evidence of liver dysfunction may occur in 0.7 to 1% of patients on long-term treatment with dantrolene, with symptomatic hepatitis in 0.35 to 0.5% and fatal hepatitis in 0.1 to 0.2%. The drug commonly causes transient drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, general malaise, fatigue and diarrhoea at the start of therapy. Muscle weakness may be the principal limiting side-effect in ambulant patients, particularly in those with multiple sclerosis, and therapy could be hazardous in patients with pre-existing bulbar or respiratory weakness. The dosage of dantrolene has been fixed in most controlled trials, though long-term studies have indicated the need for individualisation of dosage. The initial dose is usually 25mg once daily, increasing to 25mg two, three or four times daily, and then by increments of 25mg up to as high as 100mg two, three or four times daily. The lowest dose compatible with optimal response is recommended."
CD008686,0,309310,0,Chronic dorsal column stimulation via percutaneously inserted epidural electrodes. Preliminary results in 31 patients.,"31 patients suffering from intractable pain associated with chronic low back syndrome, terminal cancer, and other disorders have been studied after an average 6 months' treatment by electrical stimulation of the spinal cord applied via electrodes inserted through a Tuohy needle into the epidural space. As judged by three different subjective rating methods, epidural stimulation successfully relieved otherwise intractable chronic pain in from 23 to 26 of the 31 patients. Reported improvements in the ability to perform various everyday activities, and elimination of drug usage by many patients, corroborate this finding. The side effects of stimulation, both as reported subjectively and as measured objectively by sensory testing, were not clinically significant. Spontaneous electrode displacements, leading to loss of analgesia and requiring minor surgery for repositioning, were encountered frequently, as were lead wire failures necessitating replacement. The partially implanted, externally powered stimulation system presently in use also suffers from problems of reliability and convenience to the patient."
CD008686,0,143871,0,[Classical low back pain and sciatica syndrome caused by a melanotic nerv sheath tumour of the first sacral root (author's transl)].,"This is the description of the case of a 22 year old patient with low back pain and sciatica on the right side investigated by lumbar Dimer-X-Myelography. The result of the examination was an impression in the contrast column at the L5/S 1 level on the right. At operation an intradural tumour, plum-sized, well-defined, and blue-black in colour, was found and removed. Histologically the tumour was melanotic and of high cellular density, with spindle-shaped cells as well as giant cells, with round nuclei, considerable polymorphism, and atypical mitoses. On the basis of the operation finding, the clinical course, and the histology, the diagnosis is melanotic nerve sheath tumour of the first sacral root. For two years following operation the patient has experienced no discomfort."
CD008686,0,192413,0,The neurological complications of cardiac transplantation.,"Review of the neurological complications encountered in 83 patients who received cardiac homografts over a seven-year period leads to the following conclusions: (1) Neurological disorders are common in transplant recipients, occurring in over 50 per cent of patients. (2) Infection was the single most frequent cause of the neurological dysfunction, being responsible for one-third of all CNS complications. (3) The infective organisms were typically those considered to be usually of low pathogenicity: fungi, viruses, protozoa and an uncommon bacterial strain. (4) Other clinical neurological syndromes were related to vascular lesions, often apparently from cerebral ischaemia or infarction occurring during the surgical procedure, metabolic encephalopathies, cerebral microglioma, acute psychotic episodes and back pain from vertebral compression fractures. (5) The infectious complications and probably the development of neoplasms de novo, are related to immunosuppressive therapy which impairs virtually all host defence mechanisms and alters the nature of the host's response to infective agents or other foreign antigens. (6) Because neurological symptoms and signs were usually those of behavioural changes or deterioration in intellectual performance, the neurological examination was often of little value in diagnosing the nature or even the anatomical site of the neuropathological process. (7) The possibility of an infectious origin of the neurological manifestations must be aggressively pursued even in the absence of fever and a significantly abnormal spinal fluid examination. The diagnostic error made most frequently was to ascribe neurological symptoms erroneously to metabolic disturbances or to ""intensive care unit psychosis"" when they were in fact due to unrecognized CNS infection. (8) Maintenance of mean cardiopulmonary bypass pressures above 70 mmHg, particularly in patients with known arteriosclerosis, may reduce operative morbidity. (9) Though increased diagnostic accuracy is possible with routine use of a variety of radiological and laboratory techniques, two further requirements probably must be met before a significant reduction in the frequency of neurological complications will occur: the advent of greater immunospecificity in suppressing rejection of the grafted organ while preserving defences against infection; and a more effective armamentarium of antiviral and antifungal drugs."

The study of literature--so far scarcely taken notice of in German speaking Countries--as well as own observations lead to an organisation or array of the atypical symptoms, i.e. remote symptoms of tumors above the 12th thoracic vertebra shown as predominantly ""central pseudoperipheral sciatica"", more rare general peripheral findings in the lumbosacral region due to early tumoral irritation of the spinothalamic tract or the dorsal funiculi or congestional changes of the spinal fluid as well in the vascular apparatus. Tumors below the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra show an almost indistinguishable mixture of remote and local symptoms of the above nature preceeding typical clinical tumor manifestations."

Determination of the activity of the periurethral striated muscle in relation to bladder dysfunction is extremely important in the selection of patients for bethanechol therapy. In the absence of structural obstruction, bethanechol can be used in patients with (1) the early phase of coordinated reflex neurogenic bladder and sphincter when there is incomplete bladder emptying due to feeble or unsustained detrusor contractions, (2) recovery phase of spinal shock when the periurethral striated muscle has recovered and is under voluntary control, (3) incomplete motor paralytic bladder with coordinated sphincter, and (4) sensory paralytic bladder with decompensation. The bethanechol regimen will vary in accordance with the type of bladder being treated."

An areflexic cystometrogram, impaired electromyographic sphincter activity and delayed reflex-evoked potentials from stimulation of the detrusor muscle and urethra were the most consistent indicators of lesions of the conus medullaris and/oather than the ice water test is suggested."
CD008686,0,966815,0,The diagnosis and natural history of spinal cord arteriovenous malformations.,"The present study of 71 patients shows that the initial symptoms often cannot differentiate spinal cord arteriovenous malformation from other lesions causing cord dysfunction, but the picture at the time of presentation may suggest the diagnosis. Most patients are males with neurologic findings referable to the thoracolumbar area who present with gradually progressive pain, weadness, sensory distubance, and disturbance of micturition. Early impairment of micturition may help suggest this lesion because it is less likely to be an early complaint in patients with disk disease or tumor affecting the spinal cord. Symptoms occasionally vary with posture and exercise and menses. Most commonly there are combined upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron manifestations with nonradicular sensory deficit. The cerebrospinal fluid is abnormal in more than 75% of cases. The myelogram is positivie in 75 to 90% of cases and the angiogram is almost always diagnostic."

Nerve blockade was carried out 106 times in 45 patients suffering from primary or secondary malignant disease and 71 times in 18 patients with other conditions; intrathecal instillation of 96% alcohol was performed once and 2 chordotomies were also performed. One patient needed antidepressive therapy. Major questions relating to this problem are discussed. Gratifyingly satisfactory results were observed in more than two thirds of the patients.

CD008686,0,945725,0,Hemangioblastoma of the spinal cord. Review and report of five cases.,"Eighty-five cases of hemangioblastoma of the spinal cord are reviewed, including five new ones. While current views of the incidence, histology, and cytogenesis are presented, the main purpose of this article is to call attention to the identifying clinical and radiological characteristics of these spinal tumors. Median age at onset of symptoms was 30 years. The ratio of men to women was 1.1:1. Presenting symptoms were usually radicular pain or posterior column sensory loss or both. The lesions were most often single (79%), intramedullary (60%), and located in the cervical or thoracic spinal cord. There was associated syringomyelia in 67% of intramedullary cases and meningeal varicosities in 48% of all cases. Lindau disease and hemangioblastomas in other central nervous system locations were present in 33% of cases. The characteristic roentgenographic picture is a densely vascular tumor in association with a larger avascular syrinx and meningeal varicosities. Surgery is the only definitive treatment."

She had a history of transient facial palsy followed 6 months later by progressive weakness, paresthesiae and severe pain in both lower limbs. Clinical examination revealed signs of sensory and motor polyradiculoneuritis with involvement of the oculomotor, facial and trigeminal cranial nerves. She died 10 months after the onset because of bronchopneumonia. Pathological findings in the nervous system were limited to the cranial and spinal roots and ganglia. Histopathological examination showed intense infiltration by lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasmocytes and macrophages and a large amount of reticulin. The left oculomotor nerve, both Gasserian ganglia, the right trigeminal nerve and the lumbosacral nerves and ganglia were particularly involved. The previous literature on human peripheral neurolymphomatosis is reviewed and its differential diagnosis from Marek's disease, sarcomas, leukaemic polyradiculoneuritis, sarcoidosis and Hodgkin's disease of the nervous system is discussed. The importance of recognizing this variety of polyradiculoneuritis, and methods of treating it are emphasized."

CD008686,0,945482,0,[Paratrigeminal epidermoid originated in the meckel's cave (author's transl)].,"We have reported a case of paratrigeminal epidermoid originated in the Meckel's cave. A 30 years old man was admitted to the department of neurosurgery with chief complaints of continuous right facial pain and numbness of entire right side of the face of three years duration. The positive neurological findings were hypesthesia over the distribution of the right trigeminal nerve, absence of the right corneal reflex and nystagmus on left lateral gaze. Caloric response was absent on the right side, however the audiogram showed normal. Cerebrospinal fluid examination was within normal limit. Electromyography showed giant spike in the right masseter and temporal muscles. Radiogram of the skull revealed a bone-destroying lesion over the medial florr of the right middle fossa involving the apex of the petrous bone (Fig 1). Right carotid angiography showed straightening and forward displacement of C4- C5 portion of the carotid siphon in the lateral view, and vertebral angiography showed displacement of basilar artery to the left side, upward displacement of the right posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar artery in the frontal view (Fig. 2, 3). At the time of operation, an epidermoid was identified in the Meckel's cave and totally removed microsurgically. Small amount of the tumor extending into the posterior fossa was also removed (Fig. 4, 5, 6, 7). Postoperative course was uneventfull except for an episode of headache and high fever of short duration, suggesting the signs of meningial irritation. Two months postoperativelly patient was relived of facial pain and was discharged with sensory impairment of the right trigeminal nerve distribution. Only 11 cases of paratrigeminal epidermoid, including the cases localized in the Meckel's cave have been reported in the past literatures (Table 1). In this paper we have discussed about the symptomatology and clinical data of paratrigeminal epidermoid and compared with those of trigeminal neurinoma, and meningioma originated in the same region. We would like to emphasize that the importance of differentiating the idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia from the paratrigeminal epidermoid, if the initial symptom of this tumor were tic douloureux. The total removal of epidermoid with capsule is essential treatment following the early diagnosis, however the attempt of total removal is sometimes difficult because of the relationship between the origin, size and extension of this kind of tumor to other important brain structures. And if some of the tumor is left behind at the time of operation, cholesterin meningitis is an important complication."

CD008686,0,959732,0,[Technique and value of discography for the cervical syndrome (author's transl)].,"Discography produces relatively many false pasitive findings. Their number, about 28% in our material, may be reduced decisively to below 10% when clinical, electro-physiologic and myelographic findings are considered together. It can be further reduced when results are judged in groups of varying value. Findings of high value are: 1) entry of the contrast fluid from the disc behind the posterior longitudinal ligament. 2) Exact reproduction of spontaneous pain during injection 3) The extension of a contrast band along the roots on the side and level of clinical findings. With such strict evaluation discographic findings are correct in 88%. In additon discography may be in certain cases the only method to elucidate a syndrome which clinically and in the myelogram permits various interpretations. Discography should always preceded operation. On the basis of 368 discographies with control of the diagnosis at operation its value is explained."
CD008686,0,1260667,0,Spinal cord compression in malignant lymphoma. Treatment and results.,"The natural history, treatment, and results of 73 spinal cord compressions caused by malignant lymphomas are analyzed. It is found that the spinal cord compression caused by malignant lymphomas is generally a late manifestation of the illness, although primary or early involvements are occasionally seen. In our study, reticulum cell sarcoma is the most frequently variety followed by Hodgkin's disease and lymphosarcoma. The dorsal spinal cord is the most frequently involved segment and pain, weakness, and paresthesia are cardinal symptoms. Radiation treatment delivered in the early phase of the compression is commonly successful in reversing the neurologic symptoms and a dose above 2500 rads appears to be optimal for local control of disease. The low incidence of cerivcal cord compression in Hodgkin's disease patients may be related to frequent manifestation and irradiation of the neck nodes in these patients. Early detection of disease in the deep seated areas along the spinal cord and irradiation of these areas may prevent progression of tumor to the epidural space."

Out of 23 children with Perthes' disease and unilateral, typical course the authors have observed in 12 patients pathological X-ray signs on the ""intact"" side--which were more distinct on the epiphyseal center, but chiefly on the growth intervertebral disk and on the metaphysis. In the same time, no subjective complaints and no other objective clinical symptoms pointed to Perthes' disease. It is supposed by the authors that transient ischaemic state may occur also on the side classified as ""intact"", but with reversible consequences, thus, the alterations of the epiphyseal center do not display the typical course of the Perthes' disease."

Their predilective sites are the intracranial cavity, the diploe of the skull and the spinal canal. In the base of the skull the temporal bone is the most frequent site. Epidermoids account for about 0.2-1.5 percent of all intracranial tumors. The majority originate in the cerebello-pontine angle where they account for 6-7 percent of all tumors. Their age incidence reveals a great scatter from birth to 80 years. The majority are recognized during the third and fourth decades with the onset of clinical symptoms occurring much earlier. They affect males more frequently than females. Their delicate capsule with a whitish mother-of-pearl sheen lends them a typical appearance. Epidermoids are generally slow growing lesions which may remain asymptomatic for years. The irritative effect of their content, however, can produce symptoms of dysfunction and intense inflammation. Malignant changes occur infrequently. Diploic epidermoids are easily recognized, whereas, intradural epidermoids are more difficult to identify. Epidermoids may arise in the vicinity, on the outer aspect or within the temporal bone. Epidermoids originating in any of these locations have certain characteristic features which may arouse suspicion of their presence. Examples of an epidermoid with origin in the typical locations within the temporal bone and cerebello-pontine angle are discussed to portray their individual characteristics."

Special consideration is given to the clinical and pathological aspects. The results of surgery are discussed. The family history is positive in 4 cases. Clinical aspect : a) the initial symptoms is usually pain (9 patients) motor deficits were present in 2 cases. Only 1 patient presented visual disturbances at the beginning of the disease. b) the interval of time between the first symptom and the fully developped clinical picture is shorter than 1 year in 4 patients and longer (up to 18 years) in 8 patients. c) the full clinical picture consists of motor deficit, sensory disturbances (especially dorsal columns), cerebellar signs, raised intracranial pressure, sphincter disturbances, retinal angiomas, arterial hypertension and psychoorganic syndrome in decreasing order of frequence. Pathological findings at opsurgery : There are. a) 3 cases of hemangioblastomas at the bulbo-cervical junction b) 5 cases of cerebello-medullary hemangoblastomas. c) 4 cases of medullary hemangioblastomas. 1 patient had renal and pancreatic cysts. 2 patients had pheochromocytomas with arterial hypertension. Operative technique. Microsurgical techniques, bipolar coagulation, and continuous irrigation of the operative field are of primordial importance. The tumor must be approached from the periphery and never from the center. One should coagulate the afferent vessels first and the efferent vessels only at the end. Results of surgery.

In patients with bilateral division of the sacral nerves below the S 2 level, no active detrusor contractions were registered, indicating that the second sacral segment alone cannot subserve the micturition reflex. In patients with unilateral division of sacral nerves 1 to 5 or 2 to 5, a normal micturition reflex was registered. There was a complete loss of bladder mucosal pain when sacral nerves 3 to 5 had been cut bilaterally, while the sensibility was normal when sacral nerves 4 to 5 had been cut bilaterally. In patients with unilateral division of all sacral nerves below L 5 or S 1, mucosal pain tested by means of electrcoagulation of the bladder and pin-pricking of the urethra could not be felt on the denervated side. Stretching of the detrusor wall with a ureteral catheter, however, could be felt on the denervated side, indicating that this sensation was not mediated in sacral nerves but probably in the hypogastric nerves. Thermesthesia of the mucosa was demonstrated on the intact side of the bladder but not on the denervated side when the patients with unilateral sacral nerve lesions were tested with jet streams of cold or hot saline against the bladder wall."

The majority of our cases were diagnosed as suffering from tumors of embryological origin like teratomas, dermoid cysts and neuroblastomas. The signs and symptoms were reviewed, noting the importance of weakness of the lower extremities, the alteration in reflexes and sensitivity as well as back pain. We emphasize the great help of the X ray examination of the spinal colum, both plain and with contrast media. The treatment that our patients underwent was reviewed and the results were evaluated, pointing out the fact that life prognosis is related to malignancy of the lesions and the neurological sequelae are intimatly related with the early diagnosis and treatment of this type of lesions."

The clinical picture was ushered-in by bilateral sciatic pain in a 50 years old female and was followed by rapidly progressive sensory-motor deficits of the arms and legs, leading to flaccid quadriplegia associated with paralysis of cranial nerves and episodes of mental confusion. Death occurred 4 months alter, in cardiac failure. At autopsy, a bilateral tumor of the adrenal glands was found. No metastases were detected anywhere except in the central nervous system. Histology identified the tumor as a neuroblastoma; meningeal carcinomatosis, radicular infiltration by tumor cells and parenchimal metastases were found in the central nervous system. Neuroblastoma is typically a tumor of childhood, only 13% of them being found in adult's according to Russell and Rubinstein. Meningeal metastases from adrenal neuroblastoma have not hitherto been reported in the literature. In our opinion, the most likely mode of spread of tumor cells to the central nervous system was hematogenous because of the presence of small multiple intraparenchimal metastases; however, possible spread through the perineural lymphatics, as proposed by others, cannot be excluded, due to the prominent localization of tumor cells at spinal roots level. The main differential diagnostic problems (paraneoplastic neuropathy (Wyburn-Mason) and infectious subacute or chronic meningitis) are discussed.

The tumor, which was solid and extended from the level of 11th thoracic vertebra to the /th lumbar vertebra, was successfully removed. Preoperative symptoms, such as sensory and motor disturbances of bilateral lower extremities and urinary and fecal incontinences, disappeared postoperatively. The patient is quite healthy 7 years after the operation. The domestic literature consisting of 73 cases of spinal cord tumor of children was reviewed and statistically observed. Histopathologically, teratoma and teratoid tumors were the major constituents. Neurinoma, which is a major entity in adult cases was observed only in 12 cases (16.4%). In infancy early diagnosis is often difficult due to absence of subjective complaints and, in about half of the reported cases, motor disturbance was the first noticed clinical sign. In the present case, the parents noticed crying of the baby on lifting up the limbs to change diaper and the presence of some sort of sensory disturbance was suggested.

CD008686,0,1079961,0,[Symptomatic and evolutive characteristics of articular destruction noted in chondrocalcinosis].,"Referring to 17 personal observations, the authors endeavour to clarify the main clinical and radiological traits of the destructive arthropathies occuring in patients suffering from diffuse, articular chondrocalcinosis. These arthropathies appear to be relatively frequent and older, obese women suffering from demineralization are more readily affected. The knees, coxo-femoral joints and the shoulders are principally concerned, and to a lesser extent the wrists, the trapezo-metacarpal joints and even the spine. The lesions can be polyarticular and symmetrical, be grouped in more or less random oligoarticular combinations or may occur in only a single joint space. Clinically, these destructive arthropathies give rise to severe pain and very marked functional impotence. The joints are swollen without any signs of inflammation. The joint movements are painful, stiff, and limited. Axial deviations are frequent. Radiologically, the lesions occur throughout the cartilage sheath, the inter-chondrial bone, and in the underlying epiphysary bone, in the form of massive geodes and massives loss of tissue substance. On the other hand, the process of reconstruction is very limited. In the patients studied, chondrocalcinosis was proved by the very characteristic pictures of calcic incrustations of the cartilage sheath and the fibro-cartilages, by the discovery of micro-crystals of calcium pyrophosphate in the articular fluid or, at biopsy, by the thickness of the synovial fluid. This chondrocalcinosis was primary in the cases. These destructive lesions were easily distinguishable from nervous or diabetic osteo-arthropathies, and from tumoral, infectious, rheumatic, or vascular changes. Thus, chondrocalcinosis is among the most common causes of osteo-articular destruction. It should be looked for systematically in all patients with lytic arthropathies of unknown etiology."
CD008686,0,1055015,0,Granulocytic sarcoma of the orbit. Report of a case.,"A 14-year-old youth had a 2 month history of proptosis of the left eye when he developed pain in the left thigh. Physical examination revealed a mass involving the left orbit and a neurologic deficit suggestive of involvement of the left lumbosacral plexus. The mass, a left frontal epidural tumor, was removed surgically. Subsequently, he developed marked anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute granulocytic leukemia. He was treated with various anticancer agents but he did not respond well and he expired two months later. Postmortem examination revealed anaplatic granulocytic cells infiltrating numerous tissues including the conjunctiva, choroid, and leptomeninges. Marked degenerative changes of the left retina and bilateral papilledema were evident."
CD008686,0,1145009,0,[Occurrence and clinical characteristics of thyroid cancer in a hospital population].,"The authors reviewed 83.250 clinical histories from the files of a hospital, among which they found 49 thyroid carcinomas whose characteristics they study. It is interesting to note the great incidence of papilliferous carcinoma (53 per cent of cases); a most marked incidence of the condition in female patients; the slight difference in the age of the patients with all types of carcinoma; and, above all, the atypicity of the onset symptoms in a large number of cases (28 per cent). According to these data, the authors suggest that it is advisable to bare in mind the possibility of the presence of thyroid carcinoma in patients with such unmatched pictures as suppurative thyroiditis, sciatica or cervical adenopathy, with absence of goiter, etc."
CD008686,0,1128519,0,[Long-Term Results of Surgical Treatment of Spinal Tumours in Children and Adolescents].,"Catamneses of children up to the age of 16, operated on spinal tumours, are reported. Spinal tumours of this age account for about 15% of the total (all ages). There are about 50% intradural and 50% extradural tumours. The most frequent extradural tumours are sarcomas, followed by lipomas and dysontogenetic tumours like teratomas. Intradural tumours consist of intramedullary and extramedullary ones, about 50% each. Intramedullary tumours are gliomas, extramedullary ones may be neurinomas, meningeomas and vascular tumours. Time from onset of first diffuse symptoms up to clinical diagnosis depends on growth tendency of the tumour as well as on its localization. Hence, case history in cases of intramedullary gliomas usually covers two years, of sarcomas only a couple of months. In half of the cases, pain was the first symptom, followed by disturbed motor function. In more than 50% of the cases, complete restoration or significant improvement could be achieved by surgery. In the remaining half, there was either no change or even deterioration of the disturbed function. It seems justified to replace the former pessimistic attitude towards therapy of spinal tumours in childhood by a discret optimism. If in addition other spinal diseases like disk herniation are taken into account, prognosis is even more favourable."

CD008686,0,1105227,0,[Two cases of primary intracerebral malignant lymphoma (author's transl)].,"Two cases of primary intracerebral malignant lymphoma were reported. Case 1 was a 42-year-old man who had been suffering from headache and mental disturbances for about 3 months prior to admission. These complaints progressed insidiously. He was admitted to our hospital on March 31, 1973. On neurological examinations he was in somnolence state and had neck rigidity, positive of Kernig's sign, disorientation and dyscalculia. Lumbar puncture gave a C.S.F. pressure of 240 mmH2O and the fluid contained 180 mg/dl of protein. A left vertebral angiogram via brachial artery demonstrated thalamic and cerebellar mass lesions. For the development of symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation was performed on April 7. A right carotid angiogram after ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation disclosed a frontal mass lesion. On May 2, a right frontal craniotomy was carried out and the frontal lobe was removed together with the tumors. After the operation his consciousness remained stupor. Thereafter consciousness and clinical pictures gradually worsened, and he died on May 30. Autopsy was performed, and gross examinations revealed tumors in the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes, right parietal lobe, and left cerebellar hemisphere. On coronal sections, there were neoplastic proliferation extending from the right thalamus to the putamen and a tumor in the right midbrain. No evidence of neoplastic proliferation was found outside the central nervous system. Microscopic examinations showed a diffuse proliferation of tumor cells with mitosis and polymorphism. The tumor was consisted of small lymphoid cells. Reticulin fibers were not found in the tumor with Watanabe's silver method. It was also unable to impregnate the tumor cells with silver carbonate. This case may be classified the primary interacerebral lymphosarcoma. Case 2 was a 48-year-old man, who was admitted to the hospital complaining of occipitalgia, speech disturbances and diffculty in walking. On neurological examinations, he had a right spastic hemiparesis and dyscalculia. A right carotid angiogram showed the frontal mass lesion. On April 18, a left frontal craniotomy was performed and frontal lobe was removed with the tumor. He made a good recovery from the operation and remained well for about 1 month. However, it culminated in a gradual diminution in the level of consciousness. Unfortunately, he died on June 20. No autopsy was performed. Histologically, the tumor cells had round or ovoid nuclei, mitosis and polymorphism. The perivascular arrangement of the tumor tissue showed tendency to confluence. There were reticulin fibers in the tumor tissue, particularly around the blood vessels. Microglial cells were not impregated with silver carbonate. It is supposed that this case belongs to the primary intracerebral ""reticulum cells sarcoma-microglioma"" described by Rubinstein or reticulum cell sarcoma. Both the case 1 and the case 2 should be filed to be malignant lymphoma in the wide category."
CD008686,0,165918,0,Lesions of the atlas and axis.,"The atlas and axis support the head on the lower cervical spine while providing for considerable mobility in flexion, extension, rotation and lateral bending. The first two vertebrae also function as conduits for the cervical cord and vertebral arteries. Lesions of the atlas and axis, therefore, can cause instability with loss of support and encroachment on the upper cord and vertebral arteries, or less often stiffness with restricted motion. Congenital lesions of the occipito-cervical spine such as occipitalization of the atlas or accessory occipital vertebrae can constrict the upper cord with osseous, dural, or fibrous compression. Such encroachment on the cord at this level produces a varying array of clinical complaints and findings frequently difficult to interpret. Instability of the upper cervical spine can result from congenital, traumatic, inflammatory or neoplastic disruptions of the interlocking mechanism of the atlas and axis. Such factors as the loss of structural integrity of the dens or stretching or tearing of the transverse ligament can permit instability with cord involvement. Because of the serious potential of these lesions, patients with abnormalities of the atlas and axis require prompt recognition and treatment."

CD008686,0,19991381,0,Vesical Exclusion: (Section of Urology).,"In the operation of vesical exclusion the urine stream is deviated from the urinary bladder into the colon, thereby forming a cloaca, or on to the surface of the skin, where a fistula discharging urine is created.The operation is indicated in all cases of complete or partial vesical exstrophy. It is successfully employed in treating severe cases of vesico-vaginal fistula, whether the result of obstetric injury or the delayed action of radium.In carcinoma of the urinary bladder, whether primary or secondary, it is practised, frequently preliminary to the operation of total cystectomy.In cases of persistent vesical systole and in intractable cystitis, it has also been occasionally done.The immediate operative mortality following transplantation of the ureters into the pelvic colon is largely dependent on the condition for which the operation is performed. In cases of malignant disease it is high: whereas in conditions that are non-malignant it is a relatively safe procedure.The establishment of a cloaca, particularly in the female, of itself produces no appreciable disability. If the operation has been performed for a congenital or an acquired deformity, and this has been skilfully and successfully carried out and the patient has become stabilized, the expectancy of life should not be appreciably diminished.The case of a patient, upon whom the operation had been performed twenty-nine years previously, is reviewed and particulars of others in which it was performed fourteen years ago, or later, are referred to.In the pre-operative preparation, in addition to the usual thorough clinical investigation, an examination by excretion urography is indicated, especially to determine the possible presence of a third ureter or a single functioning kidney. At this period it is also important, particularly in cases of obstetric injury, to be sure that the rectal sphincter is fully competent and that no haemorrhoids are present.The operative technique was carried out under twilight sleep and spinal anaesthesia. The vital importance of careful post-operative treatment is emphasized. By the immediate post-operative administration of sodium sulphate, by intravenous injection and attention to other details, bilateral ureteral transplantation carried out in one stage could be safely embarked upon without the fear of anuria developing.A detailed record of 60 cases, in which the operation of vesical exclusion has been carried out by the author is given."
