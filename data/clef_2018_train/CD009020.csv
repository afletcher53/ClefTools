CD009020,0,21429776,0,Coracoid impingement syndrome due to intensive rock climbing training.,"Overuse and acute injuries to the upper body are common in rock climbing. Such injuries primarily affect the fingers; but shoulder problems are increasingly common, especially among more experienced and older climbers who climb at a high ability level. Such shoulder problems are often due to subacromial impingement, shoulder dislocations with bankart lesions, hyperlaxity, SLAP lesions or irritations of the long biceps tendon. In contrast to these known conditions, we describe a case of an ambitious female rock climber who trained intensively and developed a coracoid impingement caused by hypertrophied subscapularis tendon and muscle following sport-specific training. Diagnosis was made through clinical evaluation and confirmed by magnetic resonance tomography. Coracoid impingement syndrome is a less common cause of shoulder pain and occurs when the subscapularis tendon impinges between the coracoid and the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. The patient was treated successfully with a conservative therapy and returned to full activity within 6 weeks."

Sodium hyaluronate (HA) has been reported to be an anti-adhesive agent in a range of surgical procedures. However, there are few reports of the outcomes of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of the shoulder. This study examined whether a subacromial injection of HA/carboxymethylated cellulose (CMC) affected the postoperative shoulder stiffness and healing of rotator cuff repair, as well as the safety of an injection."
CD009020,0,21368093,0,Humeral avulsion of glenohumeral ligaments.,"Humeral avulsion of glenohumeral ligaments (HAGL) is an increasingly recognized cause of recurrent shoulder instability. HAGL lesions are the result of acute traumatic glenohumeral subluxation or dislocation. Anterior avulsion of the inferior glenohumeral ligament from the humeral neck is the more common lesion; however, posterior lesions are seen as well. Careful history and physical examination are critical in the diagnosis of HAGL lesions. MRI is the best imaging study for diagnosing these lesions. Injection of intra-articular contrast dye aids in visualization. Most HAGL lesions cause recurrent instability and require surgical repair. Arthroscopic repair with the use of accessory portals has yielded promising results. Excellent results have been achieved with open surgical management using a subscapularis incision. Mini-open techniques involve limited incision in the lower one half of the subscapularis."

Although most rotator cuff tears can be completely repaired to bone, a significant proportion of these cannot be sutured by traditional methods. In these cases it is possible to perform a functional repair of the cuff to help restore the force couple of the cuff on the humeral head and to increase the acromion-humeral distance (AHD). This technique provides peripheral repair of the cuff tear without complete closure of the cuff defect. Our hypothesis was that arthroscopic partial suture of the cuff leads to pain relief and functional improvement for the patients while restoring the AHD."

Lasting symptoms and impairment may occur when a subsequent atraumatic rotator cuff rupture is also present. However, degenerative ruptures of the rotator cuff can also be observed in asymptomatic elderly individuals. Treatment of these symptomatic degenerative ruptures may be conservative or surgical. Acceptable results are reported for both treatment modalities. No evidence-based level-1 studies have been conducted so far to compare these treatment modalities. The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in outcome between surgical reconstruction and conservative treatment of a degenerative atraumatic rotator cuff tendon rupture."

CD009020,0,21261028,0,[The role of ultrasonography in evaluation of pathomorphological changes in humeroscapular periarthritis].,"The aim of this study was to present the distribution and representation of shoulder ultrasonographic (US) examination findings in patients with diagnosis of humeroscapular periarthritis. US examination findings in 141 patients, that is 147 symptomatic shoulders with diagnosis of humeroscapular periarthritis, were evaluated retrospectively. Outcomes of ultrasonography were distributed in groups by anatomical location, US examination finding and age. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Out of 147 analyzed shoulders, 87 (59.2%) were positive and 60 (40.8%) were negative upon US examination. The most frequent US abnormalities were detected in a supraspinatus tendon (55.3%), followed by long head of the biceps tendon (15.2%), bursitis (12.6%), subscapularis tendinitis (10.6%) and infraspinatus tendinitis (0.7%). The highest number of US abnormalities, as well as negative ultrasonographies, were detected at the age 40 to 65. The least negative US examination findings were at age over 65, where also the highest number of supraspinatus tears were detected. Due to high specificity and sensitivity in the evaluation of the rotator cuff, subacromial bursa and long head of the biceps tendon changes, ultrasound is a reliable method for evaluation of patients with painful shoulder. Its availability, noninvasivity and relatively low cost make it a method of choice for inital evaluation of such patients. Detailed history and clinical examination are going to lessen inadequate medical requests for ultrasonography."
CD009020,0,21258779,0,A comparison of early versus delayed repair of traumatic rotator cuff tears.,The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results between early and delayed operative treatment in patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears (RCT).
CD009020,0,21240157,0,Comparison between ultrasound and plain X-ray in evaluating the cause of shoulder pain.,"Painful shoulder is a common painful condition among patients. Apart from acute traumatic lesions such as fractures, dislocations, contusions, sprains and ruptured tendons, 85 to 90% of painful shoulders are due to adhesive capsulitis, acute or chronic calcific tendinitis, bursitis, bicipital tendinitis and lesions of the musculotendinous cuff. Arthritis is the cause of less than 5% of painful shoulders. For evaluating conditions of shoulder joint, X-ray has been regarded as only method of choice for long time. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an alternative procedure but the cost limits its utilization especially in Bangladesh. Ultrasonography is an effective imaging modality in the evaluation of both rotator and non-rotator cuff disorders. Because of low cost and availability, it can be an alternative procedure for the diagnosis of painful shoulder. The present study was conducted to assess ultrasonography as a useful modality in evaluating cases of shoulder pain and to compare the findings with X-ray findings. Thirty two patients with shoulder pain were evaluated by X-ray and Ultrasonography (USG). Clinical diagnosis was done for correlation. To identify the cause of shoulder pain, 100% patients were found normal in plain X-ray. On Ultrasonography (USG) 12.5% patients had displaced long head of biceps, 21.9% had biceps tendinitis, and 3.1% had bursitis. In the assessment of shoulder pathology, USG had a sensitivity of 73.3%, specificity of 88.2%, Positive predictive value (PPV) of 84.6%, Negative predictive value (NPV) of 78.9% and an accuracy of 81.3%. USG is a useful modality for evaluation the shoulder joint in case of painful shoulder even plain X-ray is non conclusive."

Understanding has improved regarding the pathophysiology and pathomechanics underlying cuff tear arthropathy. Surgical reconstruction options can lead to excellent outcomes for patients afflicted with these painful and functionally limited shoulders. Humeral hemiarthroplasty and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty have jumped to the forefront in the treatment of cuff tear arthropathy. As studies continue to look at the results of these procedures in cuff tear arthropathy, existing indications and treatment algorithms will be further refined. In this article the history and pathophysiology of cuff tear arthropathy are reviewed. Additionally, the clinical findings and results of surgical reconstruction are discussed."

Cycling injuries are mainly to the knee, including patellar tendinosis, iliotibial band syndrome, and patellofemoral stress syndrome, and to the Achilles tendon and the cervical and lumbar spine. Running is associated with most injuries in triathletes, during both training and racing, causing the athlete to discontinue the triathlon. In addition to knee injuries from running, triathletes may also develop foot and ankle, lower leg, and hip injuries similar to single-sport distance runners. Some injuries in triathletes may be mainly symptomatic during one of the three sports but are exacerbated by one or both of the other disciplines."
CD009020,0,21088956,0,[Proximal and distal rupture of the m. biceps brachii].,"Ruptures of the biceps tendon account for a high percentage of tendon ruptures. The aetiology of proximal ruptures of the long head of the biceps tendon is often degenerative and they are frequently associated with lesions of the rotator cuff. The clinical findings are often not specific and long lasting. Distal ruptures of the biceps tendon mostly occur during eccentric contraction of the biceps muscle.Clinical tests, the associated haematoma and a distalisation or proximalisation of the muscle belly in combination with ultrasound or MRI to rule out combined diseases lead to the diagnosis. The possible options include conservative and operative treatment. Tenotomy and tenodesis lead to comparable results in the literature. Therefore, conservative treatment is mostly recommended in proximal ruptures. Operative treatment is preferred in distal ruptures of the biceps tendon in order to achieve an anatomical reconstruction of the muscle function. Chronic ruptures of the distal biceps tendon can be successfully treated with free autografts or allografts."

This article presents the first report of midterm subjective and objective functional results following nonoperative management of an isolated teres major rupture. A 30-year-old right hand dominant man presented after a waterskiing traction injury to his left upper extremity. On physical examination, the patient had swelling and retraction of the teres major at the lower scapular border, which was accentuated with resisted adduction of the extremity. His teres major attachment at the humerus was not palpable. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an isolated teres major tendon rupture. The patient was treated non-operatively with a rehabilitation protocol emphasizing rotator cuff, periscapular, and latissimus muscle strengthening. By 3 months postinjury, the patient had returned to all of his usual sporting activities, despite a persistent muscle retraction deformity over the teres major. At 3-year follow-up, the patient had no subjective complaints in the injured extremity and excellent functional outcome scores. A mean 37 kg loss of internal rotation strength (as measured by dynamometer) in the affected extremity with the arm abducted to 90° existed, although this difference was not subjectively appreciable. Although previously published reports have presented various options for the management of teres major injuries, the present case demonstrates that nonoperative treatment can produce excellent midterm subjective results in spite of objective internal rotation weakness."

CD009020,0,20926731,0,Suprascapular neuropathy.,"Suprascapular neuropathy has often been overlooked as a source of shoulder pain. The condition may be more common than once thought as it is being diagnosed more frequently. Etiologies for suprascapular neuropathy may include repetitive overhead activities, traction from a rotator cuff tear, and compression from a space-occupying lesion at the suprascapular or spinoglenoid notch. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for visualizing space-occupying lesions, other pathological entities of the shoulder, and fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocity studies remain the standard for diagnosis of suprascapular neuropathy; however, data on interobserver reliability are limited. Initial treatment of isolated suprascapular neuropathy is typically nonoperative, consisting of physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and activity modification; however, open or arthroscopic operative intervention is warranted when there is extrinsic nerve compression or progressive pain and/or weakness. More clinical data are needed to determine if treatment of the primary offending etiology in cases of traction from a rotator cuff tear or compression from a cyst secondary to a labral tear is sufficient or whether concomitant decompression of the nerve is warranted for management of the neuropathy."
CD009020,0,20884978,0,Treatment of massive rotator-cuff tears with a polyester ligament (Dacron) augmentation: clinical outcome.,"We describe the clinical outcome of a technique of surgical augmentation of chronic massive tears of the rotator cuff using a polyester ligament (Dacron) in 21 symptomatic patients (14 men, seven women) with a mean age of 66.5 years (55.0 to 85.0). All patients had MRI and arthroscopic evidence of chronic massive tears. The clinical outcome was assessed using the Constant and Murley and patient satisfaction scores at a mean follow-up of 36 months (30 to 46). The polyester ligament (500 mm × 10 mm) was passed into the joint via the portal of Neviaser, medial to the tear through healthy cuff. The two ends of the ligament holding the cuff were passed through tunnels made in the proximal humerus at the footprint of the insertion of the cuff. The ligament was tied with a triple knot over the humeral cortex. All the patients remained free from pain (p < 0.001) with improvement in function (p < 0.001) and range of movement (p < 0.001). The mean pre-operative and post-operative Constant scores were 46.7 (39.0 to 61.0) and 85.4 (52.0 to 96.0), respectively (p < 0.001). The mean patient satisfaction score was 90%. There were two failures, one due to a ruptured ligament after one year and the other due to deep-seated infection. The MR scan at the final follow-up confirmed intact and thickened bands in 15 of 17 patients. This technique of augmentation gives consistent relief from pain with improved shoulder movement in patients with symptomatic massive tears of the rotator cuff."

The object of this retrospective study was to compare the ultrasonographic (US) findings of rotator cuffs in diabetic patients with those of nondiabetic patients with chronic shoulder pain. In total, 419 patients (80 diabetic, 339 nondiabetic) who had chronic shoulder pain and had been referred to receive US examination between January 2005 and January 2008 in a medical center were included in this study. The US findings of rotator cuff lesions were classified into two main categories: rotator cuff tears (RCTs) and calcifying tendinopathy (CT). In total, 114 (25.2%) shoulders with CT of the rotator cuff and 160 (35.3%), 15 (3.3%) and 5 (1.1%) shoulders with supraspinatus, infraspinatus and subscapularis tears, respectively, were noted. No difference in the ratio of tears of RCTs was found on US examinations between two groups. The crude odds ratio (OR) for CT of diabetic patients was 1.85 (p = 0.014); however, the adjusted OR for CT in diabetic patients became insignificant after controlling for the other variables (OR = 1.59, p = 0.08).

CD009020,0,20844777,0,Heterotopic ossification of the deltoid muscle after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.,"Heterotopic ossification (HO), a well-known sequela of trauma, burns, head injury, and certain congenital or acquired metabolic conditions, has a predilection for the hip and the elbow. This disease has uncommonly been found after elective open shoulder surgery but extremely seldom after minimally invasive surgery. In our search of the peer-reviewed literature, we found no reports of HO after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. The clinical importance of heterotopic bone after shoulder surgery remains unclear because of inconsistent definitions, varying correlations of symptom severity and radiographic findings, and lack of treatment efficacy data. Here we report a case of severely symptomatic HO after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair - successfully treated with excision of the heterotopic bone, interval release, and manipulation."
CD009020,0,20844774,0,Arthroscopic management of a chronic primary anterior shoulder dislocation.,"Chronic anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint often leads to functional impairment and pain. Duration of dislocation is correlated with complications, and this injury is traditionally treated with an open procedure. A right-hand - dominant woman in her late 70s presented with traumatic chronic anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint. Her physical exam and imaging studies were consistent with anterior shoulder dislocation, a large Hill-Sachs deformity, and rotator cuff and anterior labral tears. A shoulder reduction under anesthesia was performed followed by an arthroscopic double-row rotator cuff repair. In addition, a labral repair was performed via percutaneously inserted suture anchors. Following this treatment, stability was restored to the glenohumeral joint. The patient progressed well with physical therapy and, at 1-year follow-up, the patient had returned to all routine activities pain-free. Arthroscopic repair of chronic primary traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations requiring surgical treatment is a valuable alternative to open procedures and should be considered in higher-functioning elderly patients. Percutaneous suture anchor placement minimizes trauma to an already pathologic rotator cuff and joint capsule."

CD009020,0,20818664,0,Magnetic resonance imaging findings of shoulders in Parkinson's disease.,"The aim of this study is to evaluate shoulder disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is the best tool in the demonstration of complex shoulder pathologies; and to determine probable relations between shoulder pathologies and PD clinical features. Twenty-eight PD patients with a total of 56 shoulders were used as the study group while 13 age-matched cases with 26 shoulders were used as the control group (CG) in the study. Both patients with PD and the CG underwent shoulder MRI. The Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) disability scale and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rated Scale (UPDRS) were used to determine the severity of the disease. Our results showed that patients with full-thickness supraspinatus (SSP) tear have statistically significant higher UPDRS (P = 0.012), tremor (P = 0.023), rigidity (P = 0.023), and total (P = 0.002) scores. Mild group patients (P = 0.045) showed significantly higher frequency resting tremor and subcoracoid effusion than those of severe group patients (P = 0.002). Subcoracoid effusion was observed in patients with significantly higher UPDRS (P = 0.045) and rigidity (P = 0.022) scores. When the resting tremor and subcoracoid effusion groups were compared according to the severity of the resting tremor but not according to the H&Y, higher frequency of full-thickness tear in SSP tendon was detected in the group of resting tremor (P = 0.053). Longer duration of disease was also observed in patients with full-thickness SSP tear (P = 0.029) and acromioclavicular joint changes (P = 0.018). Higher UPDRS, tremor, rigidity and total scores and longer PD duration appear as the predisposing factors for the development of shoulder disturbances in PD in this study."

CD009020,0,20806759,0,Arthroscopic treatment of pigmented villonodular synovitis involving bilateral shoulders.,"Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a lesion of benign proliferative synovium that invades joint, tendon sheath, and bursa. It mainly occurs in 1 joint, the knee joint or hand, and multi-joint invasion is reported to be <1%. Rare cases have been reported of PVNS occurring in the shoulder joint. Generally, total synovectomy is a standard treatment of PVNS. However, complete synovectomy is sometimes impossible because of difficulty of visualization and access to the whole joint and subacromial space. Therefore, recurrence of the disease is always of concern. This article presents a case of 64-year-old patient with pain and swelling of bilateral shoulder joints of 4 months' duration. Physical examination showed atrophy of the deltoid and infraspinatus and a mass-like protrusion on the anterior portion of left shoulder. Active forward elevation was limited to 30 degrees on the right and 90 degrees on the left. Overall synovial hyperplasia and nodular mass was observed on magnetic resonance imaging. Massive rotator cuff tear and invasion of the lesion toward the subacromial space and deltoid muscle was noted as well. Arthroscopic examination revealed a typical finding of PVNS: yellowish brown pigmentation over the overall joint capsule and subacromial space. Arthroscopic total synovectomy without rotator cuff repair was performed for both shoulders. Clinical outcomes showed good pain relief and no recurrence of the disease, although range of motion and muscle strength was not significantly improved, possibly due to accompanied massive rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic total synovectomy in the treatment of PVNS of the shoulder joint is a minimally invasive and effective method, which makes it possible to access the whole joint space and subacromial space."

The aim of this study was to assess the interrater and intrarater reliability of ultrasonographic measurements of AGT distance in healthy people prior to testing on patient populations. Twenty healthy individuals (9 male, 11 female) with a mean age of 21 years (SD ± 2) were recruited. Three final year physiotherapy students (mean age 23 years) recorded the ultrasonographic measurements of AGT distance by using a standardised protocol. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurements (SEM). The mean AGT distances, as measured by rater one, two, and three were 2.24 ± 0.45 cm, 2.27 ± 0.37 cm, and 2.21 ± 0.31, respectively. The interrater reliability coefficient was ICC = 0.79, and the intrarater reliability coefficients were 0.88, 0.84, and 0.91 for each rater. The SEM for the AGT distance measurements was ?0.15?cm for all three raters. Ultrasonographic measurements of AGT distance demonstrate good intrarater and interrater reliability in healthy individuals even when measured by three relatively inexperienced raters. It has potential to provide quantitative measurements for the clinical management of pathologies such as poststroke shoulder subluxation and rotator cuff tears."

CD009020,0,20526849,0,Intraosseous foreign body granuloma in rotator cuff repair with bioabsorbable suture anchor.,"Biodegradable implants lead to problems such as cyst formation, soft-tissue inflammation, loose implant fragments or local osteolysis. This report represents the first published case of an intraosseous foreign body granuloma in the humeral head after arthroscopic rotator cuff tear fixation with a poly-L: -lactide (PLLA) suture anchor. A 48-year-old female patient presented with pain in her right shoulder. A refixation of her right supraspinatus tendon with a biodegradable suture anchor was performed 11 months ago at an external hospital. Laboratory tests showed normal values for C-reactive protein, leukocytes and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. No signs of infection or instability were noted. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was 8, the simple shoulder test (SST) was 4 and the American shoulder and elbow surgeons score (ASES) was 44. Plain radiographs showed high lucency in the area of the tuberculum majus. MRI showed an intra- and extraosseous mass surrounded by fluid in this area. Surgical care involved arthroscopic debridement and removal of the suture anchor. Histological examination revealed a foreign body granuloma. At the 18-month follow-up the patient was nearly pain-free. The VAS was 2, SST was 10 and ASES was 88. Foreign body granulomas are a well known but rarely described complication that arises after the use of biodegradable suture anchors in shoulder surgery. Every patient presenting with shoulder pain after usage of a biodegradable fixation material should be evaluated closely. Orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of the possibility of delayed foreign body reactions, especially after using PLLA anchors."

CD009020,0,20506954,0,Infraspinatus muscle atrophy as a function of the sagittal extent of rotator cuff tears.,"Infraspinatus muscle atrophy is sometimes observed in rotator cuff tears that appear to involve only the supraspinatus tendon. The goal of this study was to evaluate infraspinatus muscle atrophy as a function of the sagittal extent of tears, using magnetic resonance imaging. Forty-three patients (45 shoulders) were enrolled, including 23 men and 20 women with a mean age of 60 years. Patients were divided into 4 groups reflecting the sagittal extent of their tears: 16 shoulders with intact cuff (group A), 8 tears localized to the anterior half of the superior facet (group B), 10 tears extending to the posterior half of the superior facet (group C), and 11 tears extending to the middle facet (group D). The infraspinatus muscle was divided into 4 compartments using proximal muscular slices in oblique sagittal images; muscle atrophy in each compartment was graded on a scale of I to IV. Within each compartment, differences in degree of atrophy between the 4 groups were statistically tested. No shoulders in groups A and B had more than grade II atrophy in all compartments. However, grade III and IV atrophy was observed in group C in the anterosuperior compartment and in group D in all compartments. Considering the new anatomical finding that the infraspinatus inserts into the posterior portion of the superior facet as well as the middle facet, infraspinatus muscle atrophy in group C patients may have resulted from infraspinatus tendon involvement in this type of tear."

CD009020,0,20428862,0,Using chemical-shift MR imaging to quantify fatty degeneration within supraspinatus muscle due to supraspinatus tendon injuries.,"The objective of this study was to prospectively quantify the fatty degeneration of supraspinatus (SSP) muscle due to SSP tendon injuries by using chemical-shift magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI). Forty-one patients with suspected rotator cuff tear or impingement examined with MR arthrography were included in the study. The following images were obtained after injection of diluted gadolinium chelate into glenohumeral joint: fat-saturated T1-weighted spin echo in the coronal, axial, and sagittal-oblique plane; fat-saturated T2-weighted and intermediate-weighted fast spin-echo in the coronal-oblique plane; and T1-weighted spin echo in the sagittal-oblique plane. CS-MRI was performed in the coronal plane using a double-echo fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence. SSP tendon changes were classified as normal, tendinosis, and partial and complete tear according to MR arthrography findings. Fatty degeneration was quantified after measurement of signal intensity values within the region of interest (ROI) placed over SSP muscle. Signal intensity (SI) suppression ratio and SI index were calculated with the values obtained. Degrees of fatty degeneration depicted in normal subjects and subjects with rotator cuff injuries were compared. Median (min:max) was used as descriptive values. SI suppression ratio was -3.5% (-15.5:3.03) in normal subjects, whereas it was -13.5% (-28.55:-6.60), -30.7% (-41.5:-20.35), and -43.75% (-62:-24.90) in tendinosis, partial and complete tears, respectively. SI index was 0.75% (-6:11.5) in normal subjects. It was 10% (4.50:27), 26.5% (19.15:35.5), and 41% (23.9:57) in tendinosis, partial and complete tears, respectively. The increase in degree of fatty degeneration parallels the seriousness of tendon pathology. CS-MRI is a useful method for grading fat accumulation within SSP muscle."

A 38-year-old right-hand-dominant strongman competitor attempted a 300-pound overhead axle press and experienced immediate pain in the right shoulder and elbow. He had no known systemic risk factors for tendon ruptures including hyperparathyroidism, hemodialysis, alcoholism, rheumatoid arthritis, statin medications, fluoroquinolones, and steroid use.Right shoulder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a full-thickness supraspinatus tear with 3 cm of retraction. There was minimal fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus on the sagittal cuts consistent with acute rupture. The subscapularis was intact. The long head of the biceps tendon had mild medial subluxation but was completely within the bicipital groove. Right elbow MRI showed a complete distal biceps tendon rupture. Thirteen days after his injury, the patient underwent arthroscopic supraspinatus repair and proximal biceps tenodesis. Distal biceps tendon repair was performed using the modified 2-incision muscle-splitting technique. At 24-month follow-up, the patient was pain free and had returned to full activity including weightlifting but had not returned to strongman competition.This is the first report of simultaneous acute full thickness ruptures of the rotator cuff and distal biceps tendon. This case report underscores the importance of a complete physical examination and a high index of suspicion for additional concomitant injuries, particularly in athletes with unusually high stresses to the body."

CD009020,0,20372911,0,Intraosseous calcium migration in calcifying tendinitis: a rare cause of single sclerotic injury in the humeral head (2010: 2b).,"Intratendinous deposits of hydroxyapatite crystals are very common, particularly in the rotator cuff. In rare cases, the calcium located in the thickness of the supraspinatus tendon can suffer intraosseous migration into the greater tuberosity. We present a case of this rare entity: a 28-year-old patient who attended with pain and functional weakness in the left shoulder. The plain radiograph showed a sclerotic lesion in the greater tuberosity of the humeral head with a radiolucent halo. The MRI showed a lytic lesion containing the calcium inside and associated with an extensive pattern of oedema of the accompanying bone marrow. A plain radiograph taken 6 months before showed a calcifying tendinitis in the thickness of the supraspinatus tendon. A large number of entities can present as single sclerotic lesions of the humeral head. The diagnostic key lies in the existence of the calcifying tendinitis in the earlier study. The treatment of this disease consists of surgical removal of the calcium. The recognition of this entity is important to avoid unnecessary complementary tests and aggressive surgery, given that the surgical treatment is curative and leads to disappearance of the symptoms."
CD009020,0,20371556,0,Diagnosis and management of superior labrum anterior posterior lesions in overhead athletes.,"Shoulder pain is a common complaint in overhead athletes, and superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) lesions are a common cause of this pain. The pathological cascade which results in the SLAP lesion consists of a combination of posterior inferior capsular tightness and scapular dyskinesis, resulting in a 'peel back' phenomenon at the biceps anchor and leading to the SLAP tear. Physical exam tests vary in their sensitivity and specificity in detecting SLAP lesions, so MRI is helpful in demonstrating the anatomical alteration. Treatment can be conservative, with posterior inferior capsular stretching and scapular open and closed chain exercises. Many SLAP lesions in overhead athletes require surgical treatment that involves repair of the labrum back to the glenoid. Treatment of concomitant injuries such as rotator cuff tears and Bankart lesions in conjunction with the SLAP repair may be necessary."

The entrapment is most frequently due to a ""glenoid labral cyst"" produced by joint fluid extrusion in consequence of labral degenerative changes. The bilaterality of the entrapment and the association with rotator cuff pathology are a rare evidence. We present the case of a 38-year-old amateur weightlifter with an history of left shoulder chronic posterior pain and progressive external rotation weakness, and with an acute right shoulder pain and weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a bilateral glenoid labral cyst in association with partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon, atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle and type 2 SLAP lesion at the left shoulder and subacromial impingement syndrome (due to acromio-clavicular osteophyte), mild atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle and type 1-2 SLAP lesion at the right side."

A survey amongst members of the Flemish Elbow and Shoulder Surgeons Society (FLESSS).,"The purpose of this study was to determine the attitude of the members of the Flemish Elbow and Shoulder Surgeons Society (FLESSS) towards full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff and their treatment in their daily practice. A survey form was sent to 123 shoulder surgeons between January and March 2008. Seventy-three responses were returned, a 60% response rate. For 40% of the respondents, arthro-CT was the gold standard diagnostic method for assessment, 36% preferred arthro-MRI. Arthroscopic, mini-open and open cuff repair were preferred by 64%, 19% and 16% of the responders respectively. Fewer years in practice, a higher volume of shoulder operations and a higher volume of rotator cuff repairs were significantly correlated with a higher percentage of arthroscopic repairs (p > or = 0.001). With respect to the type of fixation, 91% preferred screw-type anchors, and of these 81% were metal anchors. Our results show that all-arthroscopic techniques are becoming the gold standard for the repair of full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff in Flanders."

A reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) can restore active elevation in these patients but cannot restore active external rotation because there are no other external rotator cuff muscles. We hypothesized that a modified L'Episcopo procedure (latissimus dorsi [LD] and teres major [TM] transfer) with a simultaneous RSA would restore shoulder function and activities of daily living (ADLs)."
CD009020,0,20206055,0,Medial-row failure after arthroscopic double-row rotator cuff repair.,"We report 4 cases of medial-row failure after double-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) without arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASAD), in which there was pullout of mattress sutures of the medial row and knots were caught between the cuff and the greater tuberosity. Between October 2006 and January 2008, 49 patients underwent double-row ARCR. During this period, ASAD was not performed with ARCR. Revision arthroscopy was performed in 8 patients because of ongoing symptoms after the index operation. In 4 of 8 patients the medial rotator cuff failed; the tendon appeared to be avulsed at the medial row, and there were exposed knots on the bony surface of the rotator cuff footprint. It appeared that the knots were caught between the cuff and the greater tuberosity. Three retear cuffs were revised with the arthroscopic transtendon technique, and one was revised with a single-row technique after completing the tear. ASAD was performed in all patients. Three of the four patients showed improvement of symptoms and returned to their preinjury occupation. Impingement of pullout knots may be a source of pain after double-row rotator cuff repair."
CD009020,0,20206053,0,The geometric classification of rotator cuff tears: a system linking tear pattern to treatment and prognosis.,"A valuable classification system allows for communication among surgeons and/or other investigators and offers information on treatment and prognosis. It provides a means for comparison of epidemiologic data and treatment outcomes. There is no current standard classification for rotator cuff tears. Authors and practicing orthopaedists use a variety of descriptions when communicating about cuff tears. Older classifications do not use 3-dimensional information derived from the present use of arthroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. The new geometric classification offers guidance on treatment and prognosis. Type 1, crescent-shaped tears are repaired end to bone and have a good to excellent prognosis. Type 2, longitudinal (L- or U-shaped) tears are repaired side to side with margin convergence and have a good to excellent prognosis. Type 3, massive contracted tears have coronal and sagittal dimensions greater than 2 x 2 cm on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging; are repaired with interval slides or partial repair; and have a fair to good prognosis. Type 4, rotator cuff arthropathy tears have end-stage degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint and have articulation of the humeral head with the undersurface of the acromion; are irreparable; and require arthroplasty if surgery is considered. This classification describes complete tears of the superior and posterior rotator cuff, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor. Additional notation can be made regarding the presence of related pathology including tears of the subscapularis, biceps, or labrum; instability or arthritic change of the glenohumeral or acromioclavicular joints; or fatty degeneration of the cuff."

Tendon transfers redistribute the forces about the joint and were thought to promote glenohumeral joint remodeling. Early reports, however, indicate limited ability to affect joint configuration. Our previous report and conclusions to this regard were based upon short follow-up.

However, failure to recognize specific technical aspects and improper application of these devices can lead to complications. We report a case of intra-articular protrusion of knotless anchors (PEEK PushLock SP, 4.5 x 18.5 mm; Arthrex, Naples, FL), used in the lateral row of a suture-bridging technique for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. This case draws attention to the increased length of such devices when compared with traditional suture anchors, the technical aspects of proper device use, the possible patient-related factors such as implant-patient size mismatch, and the importance of additional imaging for the investigation of failure to progress postoperatively."

Fatty infiltration progresses throughout the nonoperative treatment although it is not known at what point fatty infiltration contributes to poor functional outcomes, absence of healing, or increased rerupture rates."
CD009020,0,20082510,0,Peripheral nerve entrapment and injury in the upper extremity.,"Peripheral nerve injury of the upper extremity commonly occurs in patients who participate in recreational (e.g., sports) and occupational activities. Nerve injury should be considered when a patient experiences pain, weakness, or paresthesias in the absence of a known bone, soft tissue, or vascular injury. The onset of symptoms may be acute or insidious. Nerve injury may mimic other common musculoskeletal disorders. For example, aching lateral elbow pain may be a symptom of lateral epicondylitis or radial tunnel syndrome; patients who have shoulder pain and weakness with overhead elevation may have a rotator cuff tear or a suprascapular nerve injury; and pain in the forearm that worsens with repetitive pronation activities may be from carpal tunnel syndrome or pronator syndrome. Specific history features are important, such as the type of activity that aggravates symptoms and the temporal relation of symptoms to activity (e.g., is there pain in the shoulder and neck every time the patient is hammering a nail, or just when hammering nails overhead?). Plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging are usually not necessary for initial evaluation of a suspected nerve injury. When pain or weakness is refractory to conservative therapy, further evaluation (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, electrodiagnostic testing) or surgical referral should be considered. Recovery of nerve function is more likely with a mild injury and a shorter duration of compression. Recovery is faster if the repetitive activities that exacerbate the injury can be decreased or ceased. Initial treatment for many nerve injuries is nonsurgical."

Our hypothesis was that SIS xenograft would help restore tendon tissue in the human model, as has been shown in several animal studies. Eleven patients were followed clinically for a mean of 26 months (range, 14-38 months). Mean University of California Los Angeles end-result scores improved from 13.9 before surgery to 25.7 after surgery, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved from 36.3 to 71.8, and the visual analog scale pain score decreased from 6.6 to 2.0. All findings were statistically significant (P<.01). At a mean of 25 months after surgery, magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) showed the repairs partially or completely intact in 44% of shoulders. Intact repairs were thin and wispy. There were 3 complications, which included 1 infection and 2 localized skin reactions that resolved spontaneously. SIS xenograft did not reconstitute rotator cuff tissue or add to the quality of the rotator cuff repair. Given clinical concerns about localized reactions in this series and suboptimal MRA findings, use of SIS xenograft to augment rotator cuff repairs is not recommended."
CD009020,0,20048492,0,Upper extremity injuries in golf.,"Golf is an asymmetric sport with unique patterns of injury depending upon the skill level. Higher handicap players typically experience injuries that result from swing mechanics, whereas lower handicap and professional players have overuse as the major cause of their injuries. The majority of shoulder injuries affecting golfers occur in the nondominant shoulder. Common shoulder injuries include subacromial impingement, rotator cuff pathology, glenohumeral instability, and arthritis involving the acromioclavicular and/or glenohumeral joints. Lead arm elbow pain resulting from lateral epicondylosis (tennis elbow) is the leading upper extremity injury in amateur golfers. Tendon injury is the most common problem seen in the wrist and forearm of the golfer. Rehabilitation emphasizing improvement in core muscle streng is important in the treatment of golf injury. Emerging treatments for tendinopathy include topical nitrates, ultrasound-guided injection of therapeutic substances, and eccentric rehabilitation. There is evidence supporting physiotherapy, and swing modification directed by a teaching professional, for treatment of upper extremity golf injuries. This article focuses on upper extremity injuries in golf, including a discussion of the epidemiology, causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of injuries occurring in the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand."

CD009020,0,20033149,0,"The subscapularis: anatomy, injury, and imaging.","The subscapularis is the largest and most powerful of the rotator cuff muscles and fulfills an important role in glenohumeral movement and stability. The spectrum and implications of subscapularis muscle or tendon injury differ from injury to other rotator cuff components because of its unique structure and function. Diagnosing subscapularis injury is clinically difficult and assessment of subscapularis integrity may be limited during arthroscopy or open surgery. Diagnostic imaging plays an important part in diagnosing and evaluating the extent of subscapularis injury. The radiologist should be aware of the anatomy of the subscapularis, the variations in muscle or tendon injury, and the potential implications for treatment and prognosis."

CD009020,0,19999869,0,Relocation of a dislocated long head of biceps tendon is no better than biceps tenodesis.,"A displaced Long Head of Biceps (LHB) tendon is commonly encountered in association with subscapularis rotator cuff tears. Management options for the displaced tendon consist of tenotomy, tenodesis or relocation with reconstruction of the biceps pulley. We present 16 patients in whom LHB relocation and reconstruction of the biceps pulley, was performed in association with subscapularis rotator cuff repair. During follow-up ultrasound scanning was used to assess LHB mobility and location. Eight of the 16 patients had a static LHB tendon at an average follow-up of 26 months. Four of the 6 patients who had a groove deepening procedure combined with the tendon relocation had a static tendon on ultrasound scanning. Relocation of the LHB and reconstruction of the biceps pulley appears to offer no advantage over tenotomy or tenodesis alone when managing the displaced LHB tendon in conjunction with subscapularis tears."
CD009020,0,19998033,0,Arthroscopic-assisted locking compression plate clavicular hook fixation for unstable fractures of the lateral end of the clavicle: a prospective study.,"The aim of this prospective study was to assess the clinical outcomes of an unstable fracture of the lateral end of the clavicle treated with an arthroscopic-assisted locking compressive plate (LCP) clavicular hook plate. Twenty-three patients underwent arthroscopic assisted LCP clavicular hook plate fixation for these fractures. All patients achieved clinical and radiological union over a mean of 4.2 months (range, 3.4-5 months). Four patients (17%) showed some degree of acromial osteolysis. Three patients (13%) showed radiological signs of arthrosis of the acromioclavicular joint. In one patient, a second fracture (stress) was observed between the medial two screws of the plate without an additional injury. Five patients (22%) showed subacromial bursitis on dynamic ultrasonography. The mean Constant and Murley score was 91 points (range, 81-98). The average level of pain in the shoulder at rest and on abduction was 1 (range, 0-2) and 2.4 (range, 0-4), respectively. Based on our experience, arthroscopic-assisted LCP hook plate fixation for the treatment of unstable fractures of the lateral end of the clavicle is not without complications. However, it is an acceptable alternative method that is easy to apply with good results. Furthermore, it prevents rotator cuff impingement, allows early mobilisation and maintains the acromioclavicular joint biomechanics."

CD009020,0,19941361,0,Investigation of the static and dynamic musculotendinous architecture of supraspinatus.,"To date, the architecture of supraspinatus (SP) and its relation to joint position has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to quantify the dynamic architecture of the distinct regions of SP using ultrasound (US). Seventeen subjects (8 M/9 F), mean age 36.4 +/- 12.7 years, without tendon pathology were recruited. The SP was scanned in relaxed and contracted states. For the contracted state, SP was scanned with the shoulder actively abducted to 60 degrees and the glenohumeral joint in neutral rotation; 80 degrees external rotation; 80 degrees internal rotation. Fiber bundle length (FBL) and pennation angle (PA) of distinct regions, and muscle thickness were computed. Measurements of the posterior region were limited because of acromion shadowing. Parameters between regions and changes between relaxed and contracted states were analyzed using paired t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA (P < 0.05). On contraction in the anterior region, mean percentage of FBL shortening ranged between 9% and 21%. However, in the posterior region, shortening of approximately 2% only occurred in two of the three positions; lengthening of approximately 2.5% occurred in internal rotation. For the anterior region, the mean PA increased the least in the externally rotated position, and the mean PA of the middle part was smaller than the deep part for all states. Findings suggest changes in the architecture are not uniform throughout the muscle and joint position may play an important role in force production. The US protocol may serve as an outcome measure of adaptive changes of muscle function following surgery, training, and rehabilitation."

We present the case of an 81-year-old man affected by an acromioclavicular joint cyst, associated to a massive rotator cuff tear, proximal migration of the humeral head and osteoarthritis of the gleno-humeral joint. The mass was 7 x 2.5 cm in size and the overlying skin presented a fistula that drained clear synovial-like fluid. Plain X-ray examination of the left shoulder showed proximal migration of the humeral head migration and osteoarthritis of the gleno-humeral joint, and further MRI evaluation confirmed the clinical diagnosis of a complete rotator cuff tear and observed a large subcutaneous cyst in communication with the degenerative acromioclavicular joint.

CD009020,0,19887291,0,Overuse and impingement syndromes of the shoulder in the athlete.,"Overuse and impingement syndromes in the shoulders of athletes are predominantly caused by instability of the glenohumeral joint. Glenohumeral joint instability is usually acquired from repetitive overuse of the rotator cuff and shoulder girdle muscles, or injury of the static and dynamic stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint. Congenital hypermobility of the joint may also contribute to these syndromes in some individuals. The throwing action may lead to a cascade of injuries to the static and dynamic stabilizers of the posterosuperior glenohumeral joint, caused by the repetitive, high-energy nature of the action rather than a specific injury. Injury to the anterosuperior stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint may also lead to anterosuperior impingement syndrome.

CD009020,0,19824592,0,Upper airway compromise by extravasated fluid: a rare complication after arthroscopic repair of atrophic cuff tear.,"During arthroscopic procedures, leakage of irrigation fluid into surrounding tissue planes is a frequently noticed phenomenon usually clinically asymptomatic and resolving within 12 hours postoperatively. Although rare, this fluid may produce life-threatening complications such as airway compromise. This article describes a case of upper airway obstruction in a 60-year-old man undergoing arthroscopic repair for an atrophic rotator cuff tear. The patient presented with a 6-month history of pain and weakness in the left shoulder. Magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed a massive rotator cuff tear with significant retraction and fatty degeneration of cuff musculature. Perioperatively, all vital cardiorespiratory parameters were within normal limits. Postoperatively, immediately on extubation, he was dyspneic, and examination revealed a diffuse swelling extending from the left shoulder up to the neck and face. He was reintubated and sent to the recovery room, where he recovered 12 hours later. This article highlights the possibility of respiratory compromise due to the extravasation of irrigation fluid into the neck and chest during arthroscopic repair of massive and atrophied cuff tears, even with shorter surgical time as is this case. The widened suprascapular space will offer less resistance to the spread of fluid into the neck and chest from the shoulder. We advocate monitoring the patient continuously to prevent this serious complication from becoming life-threatening."

CD009020,0,19763696,0,Subacromial injection improves deltoid firing in subjects with large rotator cuff tears.,"Previous studies demonstrate that scapulohumeral mechanics improve after subacromial injection. However, it is unclear how injection affects muscle firing. Forty-one subjects with two-tendon rotator cuff tears and 23 volunteer subjects with normal rotator cuffs documented by ultrasonography were examined. Electromyographic activity from 12 muscles was collected during ten functional tasks. Nine symptomatic subjects with rotator cuff tears underwent subacromial injection of anesthetic and underwent repeat electromyographic examination. Subjects with rotator cuff tears demonstrate global electromyographic differences when compared to normal controls. Asymptomatic subjects with rotator cuff tears had significantly increased anterior deltoid firing when compared to symptomatic counterparts during forward shoulder elevation. After subacromial injection, symptomatic subjects demonstrate increased anterior deltoid firing. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that pain leads to deltoid inhibition and that subacromial injection leads to improved deltoid firing and, subsequently, improved shoulder function. This study provides direct evidence that subacromial injection improves deltoid firing in symptomatic subjects with rotator cuff tears. These findings reinforce the concept that deltoid inhibition resulting from pain is an important component of the motor disability associated with rotator cuff tears."

We classified the morphologic characteristics of the acromion (shape and thickness) and acromial spurs and determined whether they correlated with rotator cuff tears. We measured acromial shape and thickness using simple radiography and MR arthrography or CT arthrography in 106 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears and in 102 patients without tears. Acromial spurs could be classified morphologically into six types: heel, lateral/anterior traction, lateral/anterior bird beak, and medial. We found acromial spurs in 142 of the 208 patients (68%), and their incidence increased with age. The acromial spur was more common in the cuff tear group. The heel type was most common and detected in 59 patients (56%) in the cuff tear group and in 36 patients (35%) in the control group. The flat acromion was more common (60%) than curved and hooked acromion; however, there was no major difference between acromial shape and cuff tear. The mean acromial thickness was 8.0 mm, and the cuff tear group had thicker acromion. These data suggest acromial spurs can be classified according to the distinct morphology, and the most common heel-type spur might be a risk factor for full-thickness rotator cuff tears."

CD009020,0,19725488,0,Diagnosis and treatment of biceps tendinitis and tendinosis.,"Biceps tendinitis is inflammation of the tendon around the long head of the biceps muscle. Biceps tendinosis is caused by degeneration of the tendon from athletics requiring overhead motion or from the normal aging process. Inflammation of the biceps tendon in the bicipital groove, which is known as primary biceps tendinitis, occurs in 5 percent of patients with biceps tendinitis. Biceps tendinitis and tendinosis are commonly accompanied by rotator cuff tears or SLAP (superior labrum anterior to posterior) lesions. Patients with biceps tendinitis or tendinosis usually complain of a deep, throbbing ache in the anterior shoulder. Repetitive overhead motion of the arm initiates or exacerbates the symptoms. The most common isolated clinical finding in biceps tendinitis is bicipital groove point tenderness with the arm in 10 degrees of internal rotation. Local anesthetic injections into the biceps tendon sheath may be therapeutic and diagnostic. Ultrasonography is preferred for visualizing the overall tendon, whereas magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography arthrography is preferred for visualizing the intra-articular tendon and related pathology. Conservative management of biceps tendinitis consists of rest, ice, oral analgesics, physical therapy, or corticosteroid injections into the biceps tendon sheath. Surgery should be considered if conservative measures fail after three months, or if there is severe damage to the biceps tendon."

We believe that these lesions must be treated with surgical repair: we hereby describe our technique of transtendon arthroscopic repair. We have treated 33 patients with an average age of 53.3 years (range 34-69). The average follow-up was 33 months (range 26-45). The post-operative Constant score values have shown a total increase of 48.2 points (from preoperative 44.4 points to post-operative 91.6 points). In the MRI follow-up assessment no cases of retears have occurred. The use of this technique enables the reconstitution of the tendon with complete reconstruction of its footprint without damaging its intact part. We believe that this can allow a better recovery."
CD009020,0,19708627,0,Intramuscular lipoma of the supraspinatus causing impingement syndrome.,"Impingement syndrome is a common ailment of the shoulder, particularly in individuals who perform repetitive overhead activities, such as athletes and laborers. Patients typically report progressive shoulder pain often exacerbated by flexion and abduction and may demonstrate a classic painful arc of motion. This article describes a case of a 45-year-old man with signs and symptoms consistent with impingement syndrome. Workup revealed a well-circumscribed, homogeneous lesion within the supraspinatus muscle on magnetic resonance imaging. The patient underwent uncomplicated marginal excision of the mass with a final diagnosis of benign lipoma. Lipomas represent one of the most common soft tissue tumors, although there are no reports of an intramuscular supraspinatous lipoma causing impingement syndrome. In our case, there were no findings on history, physical examination, or radiographs that would place neoplasm high on a differential. Magnetic resonance imaging provided the crucial information necessary to narrow the differential diagnosis and formulate a preoperative plan. Marginal resection of the mass was curative in this patient, as he remained pain free and regained excellent motion postoperatively."

Twenty patients with a mean age was 55.8 +/- 6 years underwent this procedure and were examined at averages of 24.7 (n = 17) and 70.6 (n = 13) months. Two patients did not improve presumably because of failure of the transfer. The Constant and Murley score increased from 55.6 to 90.4 after 2 years and to 87.9 after 5 years. The mean active flexion increased from 119.4 degrees to 169.3 degrees and reached 170 degrees after 5 years, and mean external rotation increased from 12 degrees to 35 degrees , finally reaching 23 degrees .

CD009020,0,19629607,0,Does an arthroscopic suture bridge technique maintain repair integrity?: a serial evaluation by ultrasonography.,"Biomechanical studies suggest a suture bridge technique enhances rotator cuff tendon footprint contact area, holding strength, and mean contact pressure. Based on these studies, we asked whether (1) the suture bridge technique would provide a high rate of cuff integrity after surgery, (2) the status of the repaired cuff would change with time, (3) preoperative factors could predict postoperative cuff integrity, and (4) patients with retears had less favorable pain, functional scores, range of motion (ROM), and muscle strength compared with those with intact repairs. We prospectively followed 78 patients with arthroscopic repairs in whom we used the suture bridge technique. The integrity of the rotator cuff repair was determined using ultrasonographic evaluation at 4.5 and 12 months after surgery. Ultrasonography revealed intact cuffs in 91% at 4.5 months postoperatively, all of which were maintained at the 12-month followup. Failure rates were 17.6% (three of 17) for massive tears, 11.1% (two of 18) for large tears, 6.3% (two of 32) for medium tears, and no failures for small tears. Preoperative fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus muscle was a strong predictor of cuff integrity. We found no correlation between the integrity and clinical outcomes except for a temporary decrease of abduction strength at 6 months. Arthroscopic repair using suture bridge technique can achieve a low retear rate in shoulders treated for rotator cuff tears, but the occurrence of retear did not influence the outcome."

From a group of siblings of patients with a tear of the rotator cuff and of controls studied five years earlier, we determined the prevalence of tears of the rotator cuff with and without associated symptoms using ultrasound and the Oxford Shoulder Score. In the five years since the previous assessment, three of 62 (4.8%) of the sibling group and one of the 68 (1.5%) controls had undergone shoulder surgery. These subjects were excluded from the follow-up. Full-thickness tears were found in 39 of 62 (62.9%) siblings and in 15 of 68 (22.1%) controls (p = 0.0001). The relative risk of full-thickness tears in siblings as opposed to controls was 2.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 4.64), compared to 2.42 (95% CI 1.77 to 3.31) five years earlier. Full-thickness tears associated with pain were found in 30 of 39 (76.9%) tears in the siblings and in eight of 15 (53.3%) tears in the controls (p = 0.045). The relative risk of pain associated with a full-thickness tear in the siblings as opposed to the controls was 1.44 (95% CI 2.04 to 8.28) (p = 0.045). In the siblings group ten of 62 (16.1%) had progressed in terms of tear size or development compared to one of 68 (1.5%) in the control group which had increased in size. Full-thickness rotator cuff tears in siblings are significantly more likely to progress over a period of five years than in a control population.

Mean UCLA score at latest follow-up was 28.5 and mean Constant score was 80.3. Constant scores were found to be significantly low for the failed group. Age was found to be significantly related to failed repair. Fatty infiltration stage in the failed repair group was significantly high, and a strong positive correlation for both groups existed pre and postoperatively.

We asked whether the presence or absence of an anatomic repair influenced outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed 47 patients (49 shoulders) treated by open proximalized reinsertion of the supraspinatus tendon for chronic retracted detachment. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 59 years. At a minimum 60-month followup (mean, 87 months; range, 60-133 months), we observed an improvement in the age- and gender-adjusted Constant-Murley score from 67% preoperatively to 95% postoperatively and in the pain score. With the last followup MRI, the supraspinatus tendon had reruptured in five patients (12%); the presence of a rerupture did not negatively influence the functional result. Once healing of the repaired tendons was achieved, supraspinatus muscle atrophy never worsened. However, on MRI, fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles increased postoperatively despite tendon healing. Radiographic centering of the humeral head was preserved and glenohumeral arthritis remained stable. Functional results were better when the standardized supraspinatus muscle area was greater than 0.5 at the final evaluation."

CD009020,0,19481859,0,Dynamic visualization of the coracoacromial ligament by ultrasound.,"Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is prevalent in athletes who make throwing motions over their heads, as well as in the normal population, but it is difficult to diagnose precisely using physical examination and traditional imaging modalities. Furthermore, the diagnostic testing protocols have not been strictly standardized. We used ultrasound to dynamically visualize coracoacromial ligament (CAL) morphology during shoulder impingement tests: the CAL is the key impinging structure in SIS. Fifty normal shoulders were examined. With the transducer placed on the CAL, the shoulders were examined with seven different testing protocols described in the literature. The degree of CAL bulge from the resting position was measured, and the degree of bulge in different testing protocols was compared. We found that the Hawkins-Kennedy impingement test caused more CAL bulge than the Neer's impingement test, and the most prominent morphological change in the CAL occurred with an internally rotated and horizontally abducted shoulder. We conclude that high-resolution ultrasound is an excellent tool for dynamically inspecting the impinging structures, is applicable in clinical settings, and allows more accurate diagnosis of SIS."

CD009020,0,19448877,0,Simultaneous bilateral contracture of the infraspinatus muscle.,"A case of bilateral fibrotic contracture of the infraspinatus muscles in a five-year-old Belgian Shepherd dog is described. The dog was presented with progressive forelimb lameness with postural and gait abnormalities three months after an episode of overexertion. When walking, the lower part of both forelimbs swung in a lateral arc causing a circumduction movement and in the standing position, the dog showed elbow adduction with external rotation of the distal part of both front limbs. Orthopaedic examination revealed bilateral atrophy of both infraspinatus and supraspinatus muscles and restriction in the range of motion of both shoulders, especially when attempting abduction and flexion. No specific findings were observed in the shoulder or elbow radiographs but hyperechogenic areas were evident in the ultrasonographic examination of both infraspinatus muscles. A diagnosis of fibrotic contracture of both infraspinatus muscles was established and bilateral tenectomy of the insertion tendons of the infraspinatus muscles was performed. Complete recovery of the animal was achieved after the surgery, which was confirmed in a long-term follow-up (10 months).

CD009020,0,19434410,0,Pectoralis major transfer for the treatment of irreparable anterosuperior rotator cuff tears.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of subcoracoid pectoralis major transfer for the treatment of irreparable anterosuperior rotator cuff tears. This type of tear involves complete rupture of the subscapularis in combination with either the supraspinatus alone or the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. These ruptures are characterised by a poor quality of the rotator cuff that does not allow for a direct tendon-to-bone reconstruction. Between 2000 and 2006, 15 patients were treated using a deltopectoral approach and transfer of the clavicular part of the pectoralis major to the lesser tuberosity and to the anterior part of the greater tuberosity. After an average follow-up (follow-up rate 100%) of 37 months the average functional rating using the Constant and Murley score (CS) increased from 51.73 +/- 16.18 to 68.17 +/- 8.84 points (p = 0.005). The mean subcategories of the Constant score for pain (p = 0.005), activities of daily living (p = 0.008) but not for range of motion (p = 0.9), significantly improved. At follow-up 13 patients (87%) were available for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulder. Nine patients (70%) had an intact transferred pectoralis major muscle, two (15%) had one that was thin but intact and two patients a rupture (one complete).

CD009020,0,19349223,0,Results of latissimus dorsi tendon transfer for irreparable cuff tears.,"Rupture of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendon (and teres minor) can cause loss of active external rotation (ER), entailing severe functional disability in daily activities. Latissimus dorsi tendon transfer (LDTT), proposed by Gerber in 1988, appears to be the best adapted solution in these cases of irreparable posterior and superior cuff tears. Between 2001 and 2004, 30 patients were operated on by the technique described by Gerber, with the transfer fixed anteriorly to the subscapularis tendon and laterally to the greater tuberosity by transosseous suture. One patient, subsequently requiring revision with a reversed prosthesis, was considered as a failure. Twenty-six patients were reviewed with a mean follow-up delay of 34+/-12 months. There were 14 men and 13 women. Mean age was 55.5 years (36 to 71 years). Preoperatively, active ER was symmetric in seven cases, loss of active ER was moderate with positive lag sign in five cases, significant with positive dropping sign in six cases, and severe in nine cases. Fatty muscular degeneration was present and significant in all cases for the infraspinatus muscle and in 14 cases for the teres minor muscle (associated with significant ER loss). Subjectively, 85% of the patients were very satisfied or satisfied and the Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV) was 68+/-17%. The pain score improved from 4.8+/-3 preoperatively to 12.2+/-2 postoperatively, strength from 3.7+/-2 kg to 4.2+/-1.8 kg, mean Constant score from 50+/-12 to 74+/-9, and Constant score adjusted for age and gender from 62+/-15% to 91+/-11%. Mean active ER gain was 7 degrees (-30 degrees to +50 degrees). The loss of active ER was aggravated in one case, unchanged in three, improved in nine and corrected in six. Hornblower sign was corrected in six cases and persisted in nine. Postoperatively, 8% of the patients were unable to eat and drink, compared to 64.7% preoperatively. The results of this series are comparable to those found in the literature for first-intention cases. LDTT restored active ER, but the results were incomplete and variable. Improvement was better in case of severe preoperative active ER deficit and insufficiency of the teres minor muscle. Recovery of strength was not observed in the present series. A narrow subacromial space and grade-3 Hamada classification had negative impact. In spite of an expected tenodesis effect, LDTT did not recenter the humeral head. LDTT compensates the deficient teres minor muscle rather than the infraspinatus muscle. The optimal indication for LDTT is irreparable superior and posterior rotator cuff rupture with loss of active ER associated with a deficient teres minor muscle. It is debatable whether LDTT is indicated in the absence of active motion deficiency: improvement was observed in these cases, but only in terms of subjective criteria."
CD009020,0,19347412,0,Reliability of the grading system for fatty degeneration of rotator cuff muscles.,"Fatty degeneration of the rotator cuff muscles is considered one of the most important factors for the outcomes of cuff repair. However, the reliability of the grading system is not well validated. Two specialists in musculoskeletal radiology and three shoulder fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons reviewed the fatty degeneration grades of each cuff muscle of consecutive 75 full-thickness cuff tears. Fatty degeneration grades were assessed according to the systems of Goutallier et al. and Fuchs et al. using preoperative MR and postoperative CT arthrographies. The interclass correlation coefficient was analyzed to assess interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities. For interobserver reliability using the system of Goutallier et al. the interclass correlation coefficient was higher in MR arthrography (0.6-0.72) than in CT arthrography (0.43-0.6) and higher for radiologists (0.58-0.78) than for orthopaedic surgeons (0.32-0.68). There was no difference between the systems of Goutallier et al. and Fuchs et al. Intraobserver reliabilities showed a similar pattern (0.26-0.81), but the level of experience should be considered. Although the system of Goutallier et al. is most widely used in orthopaedics, reported data should be interpreted carefully because of the relatively low reliability."

Occasionally, physicians will obtain a repeat MRI of a shoulder that has not had surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to determine whether repeat shoulder MRI is diagnostically efficacious. All shoulder MRIs (1252 studies) performed at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) over a 5-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a surgical intervention prior to repeat MRI were excluded. A total of 19 patients with 22 repeat shoulder MRIs (1.8% of all shoulder MRIs) were identified. The initial and repeat shoulder MRI findings were compared to determine whether a change in pathology could be detected. In 12 (54%) repeat shoulder MRIs studied, significant progression of pathology was noted. The initial MRI did not depict a rotator cuff tear in 17 patients, while subsequent MRI was remarkable for a cuff tear in 8 (47%) of these patients. Furthermore, of the 12 patients demonstrating considerable progression of disease, 4 (33%) had a repeat shoulder MRI within 90 days. The results of the study demonstrate that MRI is an effective modality for detecting shoulder pathology. In select cases in which the findings may be unremarkable, repeat shoulder MRI may be indicated."

CD009020,0,19283436,0,Cigarette smoking increases the risk for rotator cuff tears.,"There is little available evidence regarding risk factors for rotator cuff tears. Cigarette smoking may be an important risk factor for rotator cuff disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if cigarette smoking correlates with an increased risk for rotator cuff tears in patients who present with shoulder pain. A questionnaire was administered to 586 consecutive patients 18 years of age or older who had a diagnostic shoulder ultrasound for unilateral, atraumatic shoulder pain with no history of shoulder surgery. Three hundred seventy-five patients had a rotator cuff tear and 211 patients did not. Data regarding cigarette smoking were obtained for 584 of 586 patients. A history of smoking (61.9% versus 48.3%), smoking within the last 10 years (35.2% versus 30.1%), mean duration of smoking (23.4 versus 20.2 years), mean packs per day of smoking (1.25 versus 1.10 packs per day), and mean pack-years of smoking (30.1 versus 22.0) correlated with an increased risk for rotator cuff tear. We observed a dose-dependent and time-dependent relationship between smoking and rotator cuff tears. We observed a strong association between smoking and rotator cuff disease. This may indicate smoking is an important risk factor for the development of rotator cuff tears."

Description and case report on rotator cuff tendon.","Rotator cuff tears are common soft-tissue injuries that often require surgical treatment. Initial efforts to better tendon healing centered on improving the strength of repair. More recent studies have focused on abiologic enhancement of the healing process. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a fraction of plasma that has been isolated and used to enhance regeneration in bone and soft tissues. The healing potential of PRP has been attributed to the release of multiple growth factors from the highly concentrated platelets. The ""Cascade"" membrane is a thin layer of autologous fibrine that is very rich in platelets and is obtained by high speed centrifugation of a small quantity of PRP. The Authors present the case of C.U., a right-handed 53 year-old male that came to our attention complaining of severe right shoulder pain and ROM reduction. The MRI showed a thick tear of the sovraspinatus tendon with retraction of the muscle. The patient underwent surgical repair with arthroscopy and mini-open approach with acromionplasty, subacromial decompression, cuff repair by trans-bone suture and application of the ""Cascade"" membrane (A.T. Grade Milano, Italy) that was sutured side-to-side to close the 10 mm tear. A standard rehabilitation protocol for rotator cuff tears was performed. A MRI 6 months after surgical repair showed the complete integrity of the cuff under the membrane. Currently no widely accepted treatment for massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears is available. Allograft reconstruction to span the remaining defect in massive rotator cuff tears will lead to increase functional results; we believe that further studies are needed to describe and evaluate its potential in tendon healing; multiple MRI studies will demonstrate healing of the tendon with the graft."

Eighty-one patients, considered to have stage-2 idiopathic adhesive capsulitis based on medical history and a physical examination underwent MRA. Magnetic resonance evaluations focused on combined pathologies other than adhesive capsulitis, especially on the supraspinatus tendon. The pathologies of supraspinatus tendon were divided into 4 categories: normal, tendinosis, partial-tears, and full-thickness tears. Mean patient age was 66 years and mean symptom duration was 8.9 months. There were 38 men and 43 women. Overall, 50 patients (61.7%) showed some form of supraspinatus tendon pathology [small full-thickness tears 6 (7.4%), partial-thickness tears 25 (30.9%), and supraspinatus tendon tendinosis 19 (23.5%)]. The most common MRA finding, other than rotator cuff pathology, was the impression of adhesive capsulitis in 58 patients (71.6%). Group 2 (>60 years) showed a higher prevalence of full and partial-thickness tears (P<.05), however the overall prevalence of supraspinatus tendon pathologies were similar in those younger than and older than 60 years (P=.1795). Approximately 1/3 of stage-2 adhesive capsulitis patients showed some form of supraspinatus tendon tear by MRA, and <10% of patients who were considered to have idiopathic adhesive capsulitis had a full-thickness tear.

We compared the clinical and structural outcomes of three different forms of rotator cuff repair with up to 24 months' followup. We wished to assess how surgical technique affected clinical outcomes and see how these correlated to repair integrity. Three cohorts of patients had repair of a symptomatic rotator cuff tear using (1) an open technique (n = 49); (2) arthroscopic knotted (n = 53); or (3) arthroscopic knotless (n = 57) by one surgeon. Standardized patient- and examiner-determined outcomes were obtained preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 2 years postoperatively. Ultrasound studies were performed with a validated protocol at 6 months and 2 years postsurgery. Clinical outcomes were similar with the exception that the arthroscopic groups had, on average, 20% better American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores than the open group at 6 months and 2 years. Retear correlated with tear size and operation time and occurred more frequently after open repair (39%) than after arthroscopic knotted (25%) and arthroscopic knotless (16%) repair. An intact cuff on ultrasound corresponded to better results for supraspinatus strength, patient outcomes, and rotator cuff functional ability."

CD009020,0,19059895,0,Internal impingement of the shoulder.,"Internal impingement of the shoulder is a pathologic condition characterized by excessive or repetitive contact of the greater tuberosity of the humeral head with the posterosuperior aspect of the glenoid when the arm is abducted and externally rotated. This arm positioning leads to rotator cuff and glenoid labrum impingement by the bony structures of the glenohumeral joint. Although some degree of contact between these structures occurs under normal conditions, to date most of the orthopaedic literature has focused on internal impingement as a disease state that affects overhead athletes and is characterized by the development of articular-sided rotator cuff tears and posterosuperior labral lesions. The precise cause of these impingement lesions remains unclear. However, it is believed that varying degrees of glenohumeral instability, posterior capsular contracture, and scapular dyskinesis may play a role in the development of symptomatic internal impingement. The purpose of this article is to review the pathomechanics, clinical complaints, physical examination findings, and imaging findings that are associated with internal impingement. The results of treatment will be reviewed, and a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for the management of internal impingement is presented."

The main aim was to compare the efficacy of methylprednisolone (MTP) versus triamcinolone (TMC) in the treatment of painful shoulder using an ultrasound-guided injection. Patients with painful shoulder due to subacromial bursitis and partial or full-thickness rotator cuff tears demonstrated by musculoskeletal ultrasound received a guided-injection of MTP acetate 40 mg (12 patients) or TMC acetonide 40 mg (12 patients). Range of motion and pain visual analogue scale were registered at 10 and 30 min, 1 and 2 weeks postinjection. Two weeks postinjection, both groups reported a mean improvement in range of motion (33%) and relief of pain (61%). Relief of pain of 50% or more was observed in 92% of patients in MTP group and 50% of TMC group (p = 0.02). Two months postinjection, 50% of the patients in MTP group and 25% in TMC group reported total relief of pain (p = 0.3). Patients with painful shoulder receiving an ultrasound-guided injection of MTP or TMC have a rapid and sustained overall response. Relief of pain tends to be more rapid with MTP than TMC."
CD009020,0,18996735,0,The validity and accuracy of clinical tests used to detect labral pathology of the shoulder--a systematic review.,"Labral tears frequently require repair [Kim S, Ha K, Han K. Biceps Load test: a clinical test for superior labrum anterior and posterior lesions in shoulders with recurrent anterior dislocations. The American Journal of Sports Medicine 1999;27(3):300-3]. Physiotherapists need confidence in clinical tests used to detect labral pathology to accurately identify this condition. This review systematically evaluates the evidence for the accuracy of these tests with reference to study quality and key biases. Cochrane, Medline, Cinahl, AMED, DARE and HTA databases were searched to identify 15 studies evaluating 15 clinical tests for labral pathology against Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI or surgery. Two independent reviewers assessed methodological quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS). Meta Disc calculated likelihood ratios (positive LR>10, providing convincing diagnostic evidence of ruling a condition in; negative LR<0.2 providing large to moderate evidence of ruling the condition out) and true positive rates (TPRs) against false positive rates (FPRs) in receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots and summary receiver operator curves (SROCs). Probable overestimation of accuracy was caused by use of case control design, verification bias and use of a lesser reference standard. Six accurate tests; Biceps Load I (+LR: 29.09; -LR: 0.09) Biceps Load II (+LR: 26.32; -LR: 0.11), Internal Rotation Resistance (IRRT) (+LR: 24.77; -LR: 0.12), Crank (+LR: 13.59 and 6.46; -LR: 0.1 and 0.22), Kim (+LR: 12.62; -LR:0.21) and Jerk (+LR: 34.71; -LR: 0.27) tests were identified from high quality single studies in selected populations. Subgroup analysis identified varying results of accuracy in the Crank test and the Active Compression (AC) test when evaluated in more than one study. Further evaluation is needed before these tests can be used with confidence."

CD009020,0,18941855,0,Expression of atrophy mRNA relates to tendon tear size in supraspinatus muscle.,"Skeletal muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration develop after tendon tearing. The extent of atrophy serves as one prognostic factor for the outcome of surgical repair of rotator cuff tendon tears. We asked whether mRNA of genes involved in regulation of degradative processes leading to muscle atrophy, ie, FOXOs, MSTN, calpains, cathepsins, and transcripts of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, are overexpressed in the supraspinatus muscle in patients with and without rotator cuff tears. We evaluated biopsy specimens collected during surgery of 53 consecutive patients with different sizes of rotator cuff tendon tears and six without tears. The levels of corresponding gene transcripts in total RNA extracts were assessed by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Supraspinatus muscle atrophy was assessed by MRI. The area of muscle tissue (or atrophy), decreased (increased) with increasing tendon tear size. The transcripts of CAPN1, UBE2B, and UBE3A were upregulated more than twofold in massive rotator cuff tears as opposed to smaller tears or patients without tears. These atrophy gene products may be involved in cellular processes that impair functional recovery of affected muscles after surgical rotator cuff repair. However, the damaging effects of gene products in their respective proteolytic processes on muscle structures and proteins remains to be investigated."
CD009020,0,18937522,0,Rheumatic diseases presenting as sports-related injuries.,"Most individuals seeking consultation at sports medicine clinics are young, healthy athletes with injuries related to a specific activity. However, these athletes may have other systemic pathologies, such as rheumatic diseases, that may initially mimic sports-related injuries. As rheumatic diseases often affect the musculoskeletal system, they may masquerade as traumatic or mechanical conditions. A systematic review of the literature found numerous case reports of athletes who presented with apparent mechanical low back pain, sciatica pain, hip pain, meniscal tear, ankle sprain, rotator cuff syndrome and stress fractures and who, on further investigation, were found to have manifestations of rheumatic diseases. Common systemic, inflammatory causes of these musculoskeletal complaints include ankylosing spondylitis (AS), gout, chondrocalcinosis, psoriatic enthesopathy and early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Low back pain is often mechanical among athletes, but cases have been described where spondyloarthritis, especially AS, has been diagnosed. Neck pain, another common mechanical symptom in athletes, can be an atypical presentation of AS or early RA. Hip or groin pain is frequently related to injuries in the hip joint and its surrounding structures. However, differential diagnosis should be made with AS, RA, gout, psudeogout, and less often with haemochromatosis and synovial chondochromatosis. In athletes presenting with peripheral arthropathy, it is mandatory to investigate autoimmune arthritis (AS, RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus), crystal-induced arthritis, Lyme disease and pigmented villonodular synovitis. Musculoskeletal soft tissue disorders (bursitis, tendinopathies, enthesitis and carpal tunnel syndrome) are a frequent cause of pain and disability in both competitive and recreational athletes, and are related to acute injuries or overuse. However, these disorders may occasionally be a manifestation of RA, spondyloarthritis, gout and pseudogout. Effective management of athletes presenting with musculoskeletal complaints requires a structured history, physical examination, and definitive diagnosis to distinguish soft tissue problems from joint problems and an inflammatory syndrome from a non-inflammatory syndrome. Clues to a systemic inflammatory aetiology may include constitutional symptoms, morning stiffness, elevated acute-phase reactants and progressive symptoms despite modification of physical activity. The mechanism of injury or lack thereof is also a clue to any underlying disease. In these circumstances, more complete workup is reasonable, including radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory testing for autoantibodies."

The influence of the repair technique on the failure rates and functional outcomes after open or arthroscopic rotator cuff repair remains controversial. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the functional and anatomic results of arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs performed with the double-row suture anchor technique on the basis of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging arthrography in order to determine the postoperative integrity of the repairs.

CD009020,0,18827245,0,Mid-term clinical and sonographic outcome of arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff.,"We have conducted a prospective study to assess the mid-term clinical results following arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff. Patients were evaluated using the Constant score, subjective satisfaction levels and post-operative ultrasound scans. Of 115 consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff at our institution, 102 were available for follow-up. The mean period of follow-up was for 35.8 months (24 to 73). The mean age of the patients was 57.3 years (23 to 78). There were 18 small (< or = 1 cm in diameter), 44 medium (1 cm to 3 cm in diameter), 34 large (3 cm to 5 cm in diameter) and six massive (> 5 cm in diameter) tears. There was a statistically significant increase in the size of the tear with increasing age (p = 0.0048). The mean pre-operative Constant score was 41.4 points (95% confidence interval, 37.9 to 44.9), which improved to 84.5 (95% confidence interval, 82.2 to 86.9). A significant inverse association (p = 0.0074), was observed between the size of the tear and the post-operative Constant score, with patients having smaller tears attaining higher Constant scores after repair. Post-operatively, 80 patients (78.4%) were able to resume their occupations and 84 (82.4%) returned to their pre-injury leisure activities. Only eight (7.8%) of 102 patients were not satisfied with the outcome. Recurrent tears were detected by ultrasound in 19 (18.6%) patients, and were generally smaller than the original ones. Patients with recurrent tears experienced a mean improvement of 31.6 points (95% confidence interval, 23.6 to 39.6) in their post-operative Constant scores. Those with intact repairs had significantly improved (p < 0.0001) Constant scores (mean improvement 46.3 points, 95% confidence interval, 41.9 to 50.6). Patient satisfaction was high in 94 cases (92%), irrespective of the outcome of the Constant score. Recurrent tears appear to be linked to age-related degeneration. Arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff leads to high rates of satisfaction (92%) and good functional results, albeit with a recurrence rate of 18.6% (19 of 102)."
CD009020,0,18818103,0,A new arthroscopic classification of articular-sided supraspinatus footprint lesions: a prospective comparison with Snyder's and Ellman's classification.,"The aim of this study was to find a descriptive rationale to quantify articular-sided supraspinatus tendon tears in the transverse and coronal planes, leading to a 2-dimensional description of the tear pattern. Fifty-six consecutive patients with articular-sided, symptomatic supraspinatus tendon tears diagnosed clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging underwent standardized diagnostic arthroscopy. Intra-articular findings of the rotator cuff were classified according to Ellman and Snyder. In addition, the longitudinal tear was assessed according to the length of the peeled-off bony footprint in the coronal plane. The sagittal tear extension was defined as a tear of the lateral reflection pulley on the medial border of the supraspinatus tendon and/or a tear in the area of the crescent zone. Statistically, we found a high correlation (r = 0.920, P < .0001) between the classifications of Ellman and Snyder, and we found only a slight correlation between the classifications of Snyder and Ellman with this new classification. Neither the classification of Snyder nor that of Ellman reproduced the extension of the partial-thickness rotator cuff tear in the transverse and coronal planes related to its etiologic pathomorphology."

CD009020,0,18806513,0,Axillary mononeuropathy after herpes zoster infection mimicking subacromial impingement syndrome.,"Subacromial impingement syndrome is a frequent cause of shoulder pain and it is readily confused with other shoulder problems. We present a patient with herpes zoster infection associated with axillary mononeuropathy that was initially misdiagnosed as subacromial impingement syndrome. A 75-yr-old female patient was admitted to the internal medicine clinic because of pain and weakness in her right shoulder. As she did not respond to medical treatment and local injection therapy, magnetic resonance imaging of the right shoulder was ordered. As the magnetic resonance imaging revealed subacromial impingement of the supraspinatus tendon, the patient was referred to the physical medicine and rehabilitation department for rehabilitation. In our initial physical examination, her shoulder abductor muscle strength was 2/5 and her shoulder external rotator muscle strength was 3/5. A subacromial injection test with 10 ml of 1% lidocain was negative and the magnetic resonance imaging did not show a complete rotator tendon rupture that could explain such a muscle strength loss. So, an electrodiagnostic evaluation was performed and the patient was diagnosed to have a right axillary neuropathy. A more detailed questioning of the patient disclosed a history of herpes zoster approximately 3 mos ago. Herpes zoster-associated axillary neuropathy can mimic subacromial impingement syndrome, and magnetic resonance imaging examination alone may lead to a misdiagnosis. Therefore, we imply that clinical and electrophysiological evaluations would be of great importance in relevant patients with shoulder problems."
CD009020,0,18799326,0,Prospective analysis of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: prognostic factors affecting clinical and ultrasound outcome.,"The purpose of this study was to identify potential predictors of function and tendon healing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair that will enable the orthopaedic surgeon to determine which patients can expect a successful outcome. Between 2003 and 2005, the Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Registry was established to collect demographic, intraoperative, functional outcome, and ultrasound data prospectively on all patients who underwent primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. At total of 193 patients met the study criteria, and 127 (65.8%) completed the 2-year follow-up. The most significant independent factors affecting ultrasound outcome were age (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.14; P = .006) and tear size (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.55-3.38; P < .001). After adjustment for age and tear size, the intraoperative factors found to be significantly associated with a tendon defect were concomitant biceps procedures (OR, 11.39; 95% CI, 2.90-44.69; P < .001) and acromioclavicular joint procedures (OR, 3.85; 95% CI, 1.46-10.12; P = .006). In contrast to the ultrasound data, the functional outcome variables, such as satisfaction (OR, 3.92; 95% CI, 2.00-7.68; P < .001) and strength (OR, 10.05; 95% CI, 1.61-62.77; P = .01), had a greater role in predicting an American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score greater than 90. The progression from a single-tendon rotator cuff tear to a multiple-tendon tear with associated pathology increased the likelihood of tendon defect by at least 9 times, and therefore, earlier surgical intervention for isolated, single-tendon rotator cuff tears could optimize the likelihood of ultrasound healing and an excellent functional outcome."
CD009020,0,18789118,0,Beta2-microglobulin amyloidosis in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.,"Beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)-M) amyloidosis is an important cause of morbidity in patients on dialysis. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated supraspinatus tendon thickness (as a measure of shoulder involvement from beta(2)-M amyloidosis) in patients who are on hemodialysis (HD) compared with those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In 27 patients on HD who were treated with high-flux dialyzers, 31 patients on CAPD, and 31 healthy volunteers, we performed bilateral shoulder magnetic resonance imaging and measured the supraspinatus tendon thickness using electronic calipers. There were no statistically significant differences in age or dialysis duration between the HD and CAPD patients. Each patient was asked about the presence or absence of shoulder pain. The supraspinatus tendon thickness in HD patients (mean thickness 6.6 +/- 1.3 mm, range 3.20-8.80 mm, N = 53) and CAPD patients (6.8 +/- 0.9 mm, range 4.9-8.8 mm, N = 61) was not significantly different (P = 0.289); however, the mean thickness in either group was higher than in the healthy controls (5.5 +/- 0.6 mm, range 4.3-6.8 mm, N = 61) (HD patients vs. controls: P = 0.000; CAPD patients vs. controls: P = 0.000). Patients with shoulder pain had higher mean supraspinatus tendon thickness measurements than patients without shoulder pain (P = 0.042). The thickness of supraspinatus tendons is not significantly different between patients on CAPD and HD. An association exists between shoulder pain and mean supraspinatus tendon thickness. This hidden complication of ESRD should be further studied in larger populations of dialysis patients."

Two-hundred shoulders without prior surgery were evaluated with a Simple Shoulder Test, a Constant Score, and ultrasound. Full thickness tear prevalence was 22%. Adjusting for age and gender, those with tears had lower scores than those without (P < .001 for each). Adjusting for many potential confounders, with a 10-year age increase, the odds of a tear increased 2.69-fold (P = .005). For those with tears, scores were no different for those who had seen a physician for their shoulder compared to those who had not. Full-thickness cuff tear prevalence was 22% in those 65 and older. Tear prevalence increased with increasing age. Shoulder scores were poorer for those with tears."

Thirteen patients with at least 2 positive tests (Neer, Hawkins, painful arc) on the dominant side and 25 unaffected control subjects were included. All individuals had an intact rotator cuff bilaterally, as evaluated by sonography. Isokinetic testing of the shoulder internal and external rotators was performed using Biodex System 3 during concentric/concentric shoulder rotations at a velocity of 60 degrees /s in the scapular plane. The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, Simple Shoulder Test, and Nottingham Health Profile were self-reported by all subjects. Peak torque values of patients were found to be indifferent from those of controls'. External and internal rotation strength were negatively correlated with pain (r = .63, r = .66, P < .05). In spite of shoulder pain and disability, general health in stage I and II impingement patients did not show any deterioration."

CD009020,0,18719334,0,Elasticity of the supraspinatus tendon-muscle unit is preserved after acute tendon tearing in the rabbit.,"Supraspinatus tendon tearing is one of the most common causes of the shoulder pain and dysfunction, which often requires a surgical repair. In this situation, proximal tendon stump is usually retracted medially from its original insertion. For successful reduction of the retracted tendon stump to its original insertion, the elasticity of the tendon-muscle unit should be preserved by the time of surgery. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the chronological changes in the elasticity of the supraspinatus tendon-muscle unit after acute tendon tearing to determine the optimal timing for the surgery. Right supraspinatus tendon was detached (detached side) in 40 male Japanese white rabbits, with left shoulders served as controls (control side). Eight animals were euthanized at 3 days and 1, 2, 4, or 8 weeks after surgery. Tissue sound speed that closely correlates to its elasticity was measured with a scanning acoustic microscope. In the supraspinatus tendon, tissue sound speed at 3 days after surgery was 1691.1 m/s, compared to 1714.3 m/s at the control side, but the difference was not statistically significant at any postoperative time period up to 8 weeks. In the supraspinatus muscle, tissue sound speed was not affected at all by the detachment of the tendon. The present study indicated that the elasticity of the supraspinatus tendon-muscle unit was well preserved for 8 weeks after the detachment. In the clinical practice, the retracted supraspinatus tendon stump could be repaired without excessive tension by 8 weeks from the acute tendon tearing."

In 39 patients, 21 shoulders had single-tendon tears and 18 had 2-tendon tears. Mean follow-up was 38 months (minimum, 24 months). A standardized assessment was done preoperatively and postoperatively at yearly intervals. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at a minimum 1-year follow-up. Mean forward elevation, pain, satisfaction, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores significantly improved for both groups (P < .01). Postoperative MRI examinations showed 19 cuffs (90%) were intact for single-tendon tears and 15 (83%) were intact for 2-tendon tears. A recurrent tear on postoperative MRI was significantly correlated with the intraoperative finding of asymmetric retraction.

We prospectively assessed 17 patients with radiologically confirmed, nontraumatic, massive rotator cuff tears who were treated with an anterior deltoid rehabilitation program. All patients were medically unfit, with an average age of 80 years (range, 70-96 years). Patients were given standard detailed instruction and an illustrated guide. A video recording of shoulder motion was made before and after treatment. The Constant score increased from a mean of 26 (range, 8-41) before treatment to a mean of 60 (range, 43-77) at a minimum of 9 months after treatment. Range of motion in forward elevation improved from a mean of 40 degrees (range, 30 degrees -60 degrees ) at presentation to a mean of 160 degrees (range 150 degrees -180 degrees ) after the deltoid rehabilitation course. We recommend that a structured deltoid rehabilitation program is suitable for elderly patients with massive rotator cuff tears."
CD009020,0,18712359,0,Clinical and structural results of partial supraspinatus tears treated by subacromial decompression without repair.,"Patients with primary impingement and articular sided partial tears of the supraspinatus are often treated by subacromial decompression without repair, if the extent of the tear is estimated to be below 50% of tendon thickness. It has been questioned whether repair of these cuff lesions is necessary, because these tears could progress to full thickness tears with deteriorating clinical results. Our hypothesis was that subacromial decompression without repair of the supraspinatus tendon leads to significant clinical improvement for patients with grade I and II articular sided tears without progression to a full thickness tear on a regular basis. 46 consecutive patients (av. Age 59.2 years, range 33-76.6 years) were retrospectively reviewed after an average follow up of 50.3 months (36-86 months). 26 patients (43.5%) had a grade I tear according to Ellman, which was left alone, 20 patients suffered from a grade II tear, which was debrided. Clinical outcome was assessed with the ASES Score and ultrasound evaluation was performed on all patients to detect possible progression to a full thickness tear. The average ASES Score significantly improved from 37.4 to 86.6 points (p < 0.0001). The mean postoperative Constant Score was 87.6 points. Only three patients (6.5%) progressed to a full thickness tear detectable on ultrasound examination. Only one of these patients had a poor result with an ASES Score of 35 points, the other two were very satisfied and had an ASES score above 90 points. 8 patients showed no more signs of partial tearing on ultrasound and these patients had an average ASES Score of 93.1 points. Overall clinical outcome was rated excellent in 35 cases (76.1%), good in 5 (10.9%), average in 2 (4.3%) and poor in 4 (8.7%). Our results indicate that good and excellent results can be achieved mid- to long term by acromioplasty without repair of the rotator cuff in articular sided partial tears grade I and II. These results reach almost 95% of the value of a healthy shoulder. A better result on ultrasound examination was associated with a superior clinical outcome, while progression to a full thickness tear was rare."
CD009020,0,18703980,0,The proximal biceps tendon: tricks and pearls.,"The diagnosis and treatment of proximal biceps tendon injuries continue to be a challenge. The difficulty lies on determining if there is isolated biceps pathology versus concomitant rotator cuff tears or instability. Imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, continue to provide us with the extra tool to help us confirm our suspicion of additional pathology. Symptomatic biceps tendon tears can undergo debridement, tenotomy, or tenodesis if nonoperative measures fail to provide relief. Reports from performing a biceps tenotomy often give similar functional outcomes compared with tenodesis. Cosmetic deformity on the lateral arm may be noted with tenodesis and initial fatigue. Tenodesis may subject the patient to a longer rehabilitation process and increased pain. The decision of which one should be performed lies between the physician and the patient's expectations."

CD009020,0,18657747,0,Arthroscopic intratendinous repair of the delaminated partial-thickness rotator cuff tear in overhead athletes.,"A distinct type of partial-thickness rotator cuff tear has been observed in overhead athletes, characterized by partial failure of the undersurface of the posterior supraspinatus and anterior infraspinatus tendons with intratendinous delamination. We present a technique of percutaneous intratendinous repair using nonabsorbable mattress sutures designed for the management of articular-side delaminated partial-thickness tears. After tear evaluation and preparation, the torn rotator cuff undersurface is held in a reduced position with a grasper through an anterolateral rotator interval portal while viewing intra-articularly. Two spinal needles are then placed percutaneously through the full thickness of the torn and intact rotator cuff. A polydioxanone suture is passed through each needle, retrieved out the anterior portal, and used to shuttle a single nonabsorbable No. 2 suture through the tissue, creating a mattress suture. Multiple mattress sutures can be placed as dictated by tear size and morphology, with suture retrieval and knot securing then proceeding in the subacromial space. We have adopted this approach with the goals of anatomically re-establishing the rotator cuff insertion and sealing the area of intratendinous delamination while preventing significant alteration to the anatomy of the rotator cuff insertion, which could lead to motion deficits, internal impingement, and potential tear recurrence."

The most commonly used types are humeral hemiarthroplasty, unconstrained total shoulder arthroplasty, and semiconstrained inversed shoulder prosthesis. Complications of shoulder arthroplasty depend on the prosthesis type used. The most common complications are prosthetic loosening, glenohumeral instability, periprosthetic fracture, rotator cuff tears, nerve injury, infection, and deltoid muscle dysfunction. Standard radiographs are the basis of both pre- and postoperative imaging. Skeletal scintigraphy has a rather limited role because there is overlap between postoperative changes which may persist for up to 1 year and early loosening and infection. Sonography is most commonly used postoperatively in order to demonstrate complications (hematoma and abscess formation) but may also be useful for the demonstration of rotator cuff tears occurring during follow-up. CT is useful for the demonstration of bone details both pre- and postoperatively. MR imaging is mainly used preoperatively, for instance for demonstration of rotator cuff tears."

The purpose of this study was to report our experience with the treatment of massive and irreparable defects of the rotator cuff with a modified deltoid split transfer. Between 1996 and 2004, for all patients suffering from full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff (> 5 cm tears in diameter, involving two or more tendons) were operated with a modified deltoid split transfer. A total of 61 patients (39 females and 22 males; age 61.9: range 49-75 years) were operated. Duration of symptoms before surgery averaged 9.6 months (range 3.5-14 months). The patients were followed for an average of 46 months (range 24-64 months). The operation included an arthroscopic evaluation, acromioplasty with resection of the lateral clavicular end, resection of the acromioclavicular joint and where necessary biceps tenodesis. The cuff defect was repaired by transfer of half thickness anterior deltoid-flap (3 cm x 5 cm) into the defect. All patients were evaluated both preoperatively and postoperatively with regard to pain, ability to perform activities of daily life, range of motion, strength and satisfaction. The patients subjectively rated their results--49 (80%) excellent or good outcome, seven moderate and five poor. Preoperatively, the Constant amounted 33.5 +/- 7.74 points. At follow-up, the score significantly increased to 77.57 +/- 19.74 points. The acromiohumeral distance increased from 5.1 +/- 1.4 mm to 9.1 +/- 1.5 mm. Pain free flexion improved from an average 90 degrees to an average 165 degrees (P < 0.01), and abduction improved from an average 110 degrees to an average 160 degrees (P < 0.01). The mean external rotation increased from 40 degrees to 65 degrees (P < 0.01), and internal rotation increased from 50 degrees to 70 degrees (P = 0.06). In the MRI and ultrasound examination, all patients had intact flap, except the three patients with flap necrosis. There were eight complications--three haematomas, two superficial wound infections which did not influence the outcome, and three fibrotic transformation after an early aseptic necrosis of the deltoid flap, which were re-operated. This technique is easy to perform, and it is possible to obtain a satisfactory outcome after repair of massive tears of the rotator cuff. A substantial decrease of pain, increased stability, an increase range of motion and strength can be achieved, with proper rehabilitation."

CD009020,0,18591598,0,The detection of full thickness rotator cuff tears using ultrasound.,We have examined the accuracy of 143 consecutive ultrasound scans of patients who subsequently underwent shoulder arthroscopy for rotator-cuff disease. All the scans and subsequent surgery were performed by an orthopaedic surgeon using a portable ultrasound scanner in a one-stop clinic. There were 78 full thickness tears which we confirmed by surgery or MRI. Three moderate-size tears were assessed as partial-thickness at ultrasound scan (false negative) giving a sensitivity of 96.2%. One partially torn and two intact cuffs were over-diagnosed as small full-thickness tears by ultrasound scan (false positive) giving a specificity of 95.4%. This gave a positive predictive value of 96.2% and a negative predictive value of 95.4%. Estimation of tear size was more accurate for large and massive tears at 96.5% than for moderate (88.8%) and small tears (91.6%). These results are equivalent to those obtained by several studies undertaken by experienced radiologists. We conclude that ultrasound imaging of the shoulder performed by a sufficiently-trained orthopaedic surgeon is a reliable time-saving practice to identify rotator-cuff integrity.

Previous studies have noted the difficulty in performing accurate injections into this area. In addition, one must also question the effects that misplaced corticosteroids could have on the surrounding tissues. In this case, a 51-year-old woman presented with several weeks of left shoulder pain and was diagnosed with rotator cuff tendonitis. After a subacromial injection with betamethasone and lidocaine, the patient noted 3 weeks of near complete pain relief, followed by a return of her symptoms. A magnetic resonance imaging scan obtained 7 weeks after the injection showed a full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon. Five weeks later, the patient underwent arthroscopic evaluation of the shoulder and subacromial decompression. The rotator cuff tendons were noted to be intact and normal in appearance. The patient eventually had full resolution of her symptoms. Six months postoperatively, she underwent a new scan that showed a normal supraspinatus tendon. Apparently, the subacromial injection penetrated the anterior half of the supraspinatus tendon, causing a transient effect and signal change. One should use caution in the interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging scans of the shoulder soon after the injection of corticosteroids."

Open subscapularis repairs were done in 24 patients, 12 isolated and 12 anterosuperior. At an average follow-up of 40 months, UCLA, ASES, and Constant scores were recorded. Subscapularis and supraspinatus strengths were tested using a spring gauge. Ultrasound scanning was performed in 20 patients. Average scores were 27 UCLA, 77 ASES and 90 relative Constant. Subscapularis strength was 92% of the non-operated shoulder. Supraspinatus strength was 90%. Statistical analysis showed a significant decrease in supraspinatus strength in the anterosuperior group. No other significant differences were noted. Ultrasound scanning showed an intact subscapularis tendon in all. Full thickness supraspinatus tears were found in 5 and partial thickness in 1. Not the subscapularis, but the supraspinatus determines the outcome of anterosuperior repairs, with more re-tears and decreased strength."

Attempts have been made to identify objective imaging criteria that confirm the diagnosis of impingement, but at present external impingement remains primarily a clinical diagnosis. Therapeutic management varies from rehabilitation with physiotherapy to surgical procedures aimed at decompressing the subacromial space and repairing rotator cuff tears.

CD009020,0,18327800,0,Upregulation of alpha-skeletal muscle actin and myosin heavy polypeptide gene products in degenerating rotator cuff muscles.,"Impaired function of shoulder muscles, resulting from rotator cuff tears, is associated with abnormal deposition of fat in muscle tissue, but corresponding cellular and molecular mechanisms, likely reflected by altered gene expression profiles, are largely unknown. Here, an analysis of muscle gene expression was carried out by semiquantitative RT-PCR in total RNA extracts of supraspinatus biopsies collected from 60 patients prior to shoulder surgery. A significant increase of alpha-skeletal muscle actin (p = 0.0115) and of myosin heavy polypeptide 1 (p = 0.0147) gene transcripts was observed in parallel with progressive fat deposition in the muscle, assessed on parasagittal T1-weighted turbo-spin-echo magnetic resonance images according to Goutallier. Upregulation of alpha-skeletal muscle actin and of myosin heavy polypeptide-1 has been reported to be associated with increased muscle tissue metabolism and oxidative stress. The findings of the present study, therefore, challenge the hypothesis that increased fat deposition in rotator cuff muscle after injury reflects muscle degeneration."
CD009020,0,18326164,0,Chronic shoulder pain: part I. Evaluation and diagnosis.,"Shoulder pain is defined as chronic when it has been present for longer than six months. Common conditions that can result in chronic shoulder pain include rotator cuff disorders, adhesive capsulitis, shoulder instability, and shoulder arthritis. Rotator cuff disorders include tendinopathy, partial tears, and complete tears. A clinical decision rule that is helpful in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears includes pain with overhead activity, weakness on empty can and external rotation tests, and a positive impingement sign. Adhesive capsulitis can be associated with diabetes and thyroid disorders. Clinical presentation includes diffuse shoulder pain with restricted passive range of motion on examination. Acromioclavicular osteoarthritis presents with superior shoulder pain, acromioclavicular joint tenderness, and a painful cross-body adduction test. In patients who are older than 50 years, glenohumeral osteoarthritis usually presents as gradual pain and loss of motion. In patients younger than 40 years, glenohumeral instability generally presents with a history of dislocation or subluxation events. Positive apprehension and relocation are consistent with the diagnosis. Imaging studies, indicated when diagnosis remains unclear or management would be altered, include plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and computed tomography scans. Plain radiographs may help diagnose massive rotator cuff tears, shoulder instability, and shoulder arthritis. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography are preferred for rotator cuff disorders. For shoulder instability, magnetic resonance imaging arthrogram is preferred over magnetic resonance imaging."

CD009020,0,18312783,0,The effectiveness of diagnostic imaging methods for the assessment of soft tissue and articular disorders of the shoulder and elbow.,"There are no clear guidelines for diagnostic imaging of articular and soft tissue pathologies of the shoulder and elbow. Several methods are used, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) and ultrasound (US). Their cost-effectiveness is still unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of the relevant literature and discussed the role of MR imaging of the shoulder and elbow compared with other diagnostic imaging modalities. For the shoulder impingement syndrome and rotator cuff tears, MRI and US have a comparable accuracy for detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. MRA and US might be more accurate for the detection of partial-thickness tears than MRI. Given the large difference in cost of MR and US, ultrasound may be the most cost-effective diagnostic method for identification of full-thickness tears in a specialist hospital setting (Evidence level 3). Both MRA and CT arthrography (CTA) are effective methods for the detection of labrum tears. More recently, multidetector CTA has offered the advantages of thinner slices than with MRA in a shorter examination time. Still, MRA has the advantage towards CTA to directly visualize the affected structures with a better evaluation of extent and location and to detect associated capsuloligamentous injuries. For the elbow pathologies, plain MRI or MRA have the advantage towards CTA to detect occult bone injuries. CTA is better for the assessment of the thin cartilage of the elbow. Both US and MRI are reliable methods to detect chronic epicondylitis; US is more available and far more cost-effective (Evidence level 2). MRA can differentiate complete from partial tears of the medial collateral ligament. US or MRI can detect partial and complete biceps tendon tears and/or bursitis. MRI can provide important diagnostic information in lesions of the ulnar, radial, or median nerve."

CD009020,0,18300628,0,"[Shoulder pain: assessment, diagnosis and treatment of common problems].","Shoulder pain is a common complaint seen at the primary physician's clinic, and it is the third most common musculoskeletal complaint after back and neck pain. Shoulder pain can have a wide range of etiologies: trauma caused from a sprain or a simple muscle strain to a large tear of one of the shoulder stabilizer muscles. Some shoulder pathologies can cause chronic pain and limitation in shoulder range of motion such as impingement syndrome, adhesive capsulitis, calcified tendonitis, cervical radiculopathy, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and biceps tendonitis. The physician who attempts to diagnose the cause for his patient's shoulder pain faces a great challenge due to the large number of etiologies that can lead to such a complaint. The physician has a large number of tools at his disposal starting from a thorough history emphasizing the time and character of the shoulder pain, range of motion and the ability to do everyday activities, to a wide range of imaging modalities such as X-ray, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Most of the causes of shoulder pain are adequately treated non-surgically with treatments such as physiotherapy, antiinflammatory medication and local corticosteroid injections. However, some situations necessitate surgical intervention in order to correct and restore the patient's prior level of shoulder function. The physician's ability to correctly diagnose and recommend appropriate lines of treatment, taking into consideration the patient's problem, age, medical condition and prior level of function is the secret to successful treatment, recovery of the patient's shoulder function and most important, patient satisfaction."

In the period between November 2003 and September 2004, in a series of 29 patients with primary isolated supraspinatus tear measuring > 2 cm a reconstruction using one titanium anchor and a modified Mason-Allen (MMA) stitch was done. These patients were prospectively collected in this study and then retrospectively evaluated. There were 21 men and 8 women with a mean age of 59.3 years. Patients were examined pre-operatively by a single sport medicine doctor, very experienced on shoulder pathology problem. Constant score, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) scale and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) were administered. After a minimum follow-up of 24 months patients were revaluated clinically by the same independent examiner. At the same time patients underwent an ultrasound shoulder examination to evaluate rotator cuff integrity. Clinically there was a significant improvement of Constant score, SST score and UCLA scale at followup. Twenty-five patients (86.2%) were satisfied, whether the other four patients (13.8%) stated that they would decline procedure. Recurrent rotator cuff tear was found in 11 patients (38%), who were all older than 60. All the patients but one with a pre-operative MRI grade III tendon tissue fatty infiltration, had a cuff re-tear. Arthroscopic supraspinatus tendon repair with one single anchor and MMA stitch is a reliable technique leading to a re-tear of 38% that is comparable with results reported in literature."
CD009020,0,18264850,0,Biological augmentation of rotator cuff tendon repair.,"A histologically normal insertion site does not regenerate following rotator cuff tendon-to-bone repair, which is likely due to abnormal or insufficient gene expression and/or cell differentiation at the repair site. Techniques to manipulate the biologic events following tendon repair may improve healing. We used a sheep infraspinatus repair model to evaluate the effect of osteoinductive growth factors and BMP-12 on tendon-to-bone healing. Magnetic resonance imaging and histology showed increased formation of new bone and fibrocartilage at the healing tendon attachment site in the treated animals, and biomechanical testing showed improved load-to-failure. Other techniques with potential to augment repair site biology include use of platelets isolated from autologous blood to deliver growth factors to a tendon repair site. Modalities that improve local vascularity, such as pulsed ultrasound, have the potential to augment rotator cuff healing. Important information about the biology of tendon healing can also be gained from studies of substances that inhibit healing, such as nicotine and antiinflammatory medications. Future approaches may include the use of stem cells and transcription factors to induce formation of the native tendon-bone insertion site after rotator cuff repair surgery."

Twenty-four patients with a missed fracture of the greater tuberosity underwent MR study for a suspect RCT. We evaluated shoulder function and self-assessed comfort with the Constant score (CS) and Simple Shoulder Test (SST). Nine patients showed evidence of cuff tendinosis, 11 of partial (p) RCT (2: subscapularis; 6: supraspinatus and 3: supraspinatus and infraspinatus). All patients with pRCT were older than 40. Initially, the mean CS and SST were 54% and 5/12; at follow-up, values increased to 36% and 5 points. MR should be performed in patients apparently negative for fracture but with painful shoulders and decreased ROM. Of our patients, 45.8% had pRCT; nevertheless function recovery was verified in 16 weeks."

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of porcine dermal collagen as a tendon augmentation graft in the repair of extensive rotator cuff tears. This prospective study evaluated the clinical, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging outcome 4.5 years (range, 3-5 years) after the treatment of extensive rotator cuff tears with porcine dermal collagen tendon augmentation grafting. The study group consisted of 10 patients (5 men, 5 women) with a mean age of 66 years (range, 46-80 years). Patients were evaluated clinically using the Constant score preoperatively, at 1 year, and at final follow-up when ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed to assess for graft and rotator cuff integrity. Average Constant scores improved from 41 preoperatively to 62 at final follow-up (P = .0003). Pain, abduction power, and range of motion significantly improved after surgery (P < .05), and patient satisfaction levels were high. Imaging studies identified intact grafts in 8 patients and graft detachment in 2. No adverse side effects were reported during the study period. The use of porcine dermal collagen as an augmentation graft in the treatment of massive rotator cuff tears is safe and, in most patients, is associated with improved clinical outcome. Randomized trials are required to assess any benefit over standard current surgical treatment regimens."

We hypothesized that a latissimus dorsi and teres major (LD/TM) transfer with a concomitant RSA would restore shoulder function and activities of daily living (ADLs). We prospectively followed 11 consecutive patients (mean age, 70 years) with a combined loss of active elevation and external rotation (shoulder pseudoparalysis and dropping arm) who underwent this procedure. All had severe cuff tear arthropathy (Hamada Stage 3, 4, or 5) and severe atrophy or fatty infiltration of infraspinatus and teres minor on preoperative MRI or CT-scan. The combined procedure was performed through a single deltopectoral approach in the same session. Postoperatively, mean active elevation increased from 70 degrees to 148 degrees (+78 degrees ) and external rotation from -18 degrees to 18 degrees (+36 degrees ). The Constant score, subjective assessment and ADLs improved. The combination of a RSA and LD/TM transfer restored both active elevation and external rotation in this selected subgroup of patients with a cuff deficient shoulder and absent or atrophied infraspinatus and teres minor."

The relation between AHD measured on conventional radiographs and the integrity of the rotator cuff tendons is well known. Conversely, the correlation between the AHD on conventional radiographs and that measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans is unknown. It has also not been determined which method correlates better with fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles and might thereby be a better prognostic value for the outcome of rotator cuff repair. Conventional radiographs, plus MRI and or CT studies taken at the same time of patients with rotator cuff tears, shoulder instability, primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis, or idiopathic frozen shoulder, were randomly selected, and the AHD was measured both on conventional radiographs and on MRI or CT. The values were correlated with the stage of fatty degeneration of the rotator cuff muscles in the cases of rotator cuff tears. The AHD on conventional radiographs was larger than on MRI and CT, and correlation of the values measured (conventional radiography vs MRI and CT) could be demonstrated. For rotator cuff diseases, a significant but moderate correlation (r = 0.6; P < .05) between conventional and MRI was identified, and the conventional values were approximately 0.6 mm greater than the corresponding MRI values. It is, therefore, possible to use the AHD read on MRI or CT studies for prognostic reasons, provided the values obtained are converted accordingly and remembering that the correlation of the values is only moderate."

The unaffected shoulder was also scanned as a control. There was evidence of abnormality in 21 of the shoulders (63.6%) on the injured side; ten had bursitis of the subacromial space, five evidence of a partial tear of the rotator cuff, one a complete rupture of the supraspinatus tendon, four inflammatory changes in the acromioclavicular joint and one a fracture of the coracoid process.

Fifty-seven patients with unilateral symptoms of the impingement syndrome underwent ultrasound examination of both shoulder joints, which included assessment of rotator cuff integrity, measurement of rotator cuff thickness and the distance between the infero-lateral edge of acromion and the apex of the greater tuberosity of humerus (AGT distance) in the standard ultrasonographic positions. As a control group, 36 volunteers (72 shoulders) with no history of shoulder pain were examined sonographically. Ultrasonographic assessment of humeral head elevation, measured as the AGT distance, proved to be useful in establishing the diagnosis of the subacromial impingement syndrome of the shoulder. A difference in rotator cuff thickness of more than 1.1 mm and a difference in the AGT distance of more than 2.1 mm between both shoulder joints may reflect dysfunction of rotator cuff muscles."

Magnetic resonance imaging, taken due to persistence of shoulder pain and reduction of shoulder joint mobility in cases monitored because of proximal humerus fracture associated with electrical injury, revealed a tear of supraspinatus tendon. Moreover, frozen shoulder status was clinically established in both of the cases. The cases were treated with an appropriate physical therapy and rehabilitation program.

To date, there has not been an in-vivo dynamic assessment of the baseline vascularity of the asymptomatic rotator cuff. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that regional variations in supraspinatus tendon vascularity exist with an age-dependent decrease in asymptomatic individuals with intact rotator cuffs. Lipid microsphere, contrast-enhanced ultrasound shoulder examinations were done in 31 patients with a mean age of 41.5 years (range, 22-65 years). Images were obtained at baseline, after contrast administration at rest, and after contrast administration following exercise to visualize the intratendinous blood flow to the supraspinatus tendon. Qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed by determining 4 regions of interest (bursal medial, articular medial, bursal lateral, and articular lateral) with quantification and analysis software (QLAB Philips, Andover, MA) to examine each region of interest and normalize data for interpretation of the mean intensity per pixel. A statistically significant decrease in blood flow to the supraspinatus tendon with age was observed in a comparative analysis of patients aged younger than 40 and older than 40, (P < .05 for all 4 zones after exercise and for the bursal medial, articular medial, and bursal lateral zones after exercise; P = .07 for the articular lateral zone after exercise). A statistically significant increase in blood flow with exercise was observed in an analysis of all patients (P < .001). The age-related decrease in the vascular supply of the tendon observed in this study is consistent with published reports demonstrating an increasing prevalence of rotator cuff pathology with age and may predispose to the development of rotator cuff tendinopathy and, ultimately, attritional tears."

CD009020,0,18063188,0,SLAP tear associated with a minimally displaced proximal humerus fracture.,"Nondisplaced proximal humerus fracture may be associated with soft tissue injury. This case report examines 2 cases of superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) tears in association with nondisplaced fractures of the proximal humerus. In the first case, the patient fell from a jet ski, causing a traction injury to his arm. A greater tuberosity fracture was identified. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal a definitive labral tear. After conservative management had failed, a type IV SLAP tear and a small rotator cuff tear were arthroscopically identified and repaired. In the second case, a power company lineman fell from a lift and attempted to hold on with his dominant arm. A nondisplaced greater tuberosity and a surgical neck fracture were discovered. MR arthrography revealed no evidence of SLAP tear. Four months after injury, a type II SLAP tear was arthroscopically identified and repaired. In these 2 cases, the presence of the fracture likely slowed operative intervention because pain was attributed to the fracture itself, and not to the SLAP tear. If patients do not follow the usual course of improvement after a proximal humerus fracture from a superior traction mechanism, consideration should be given to associated superior labral tears that may require surgical intervention."
CD009020,0,18063185,0,Heterotopic ossification after minimally invasive rotator cuff repair.,"Heterotopic ossification is a common phenomenon after spinal cord injury, head injury, neurologic disorders, burns and other trauma, and joint arthroplasty. Periarticular ossifications after shoulder surgery have been known to occur since the 19th century, at an incidence of up to 27%. After arthroscopic and minimally invasive shoulder surgical procedures were introduced and came into broad use, reports about heterotopic ossification became very rare. We describe here a case of heterotopic bone formation in the subdeltoid fascia after arthroscopic subacromial decompression, acromioclavicular joint resection, and mini-open rotator cuff reconstruction were performed with 2 absorbable suture anchors 3 months postoperatively. Computed tomography (CT) confirmed a massive heterotopic ossification of the deltoid muscle. During revision surgery, a 4 x 6.5-cm bone shell that consisted primarily of immature trabecular bone and lamellar bone in smaller proportions was removed. The case presented here is unique in the scientific literature. Although risk factors have been identified, the underlying pathomorphogenetic mechanism of such heterotopic bone formation remains unclear. Prophylactic administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or radiation for arthroscopic or minimally invasive shoulder surgery is not justified, given the low incidence of heterotopic ossification and the known adverse effects.

However, the results are variable, and the factors that predict good outcomes are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the integrity of the teres minor musculotendinous unit is predictive of outcome following LDTT. Twenty-two consecutive patients who underwent LDTT for massive, irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tears were retrospectively reviewed.

Following LDTT, the mean absolute constant score improved from 48 to 62 points (P = .003), age-adjusted constant score improved from 56% to 72% (P = .002), and the subjective shoulder value improved from 24% to 68% (P < .001). Fatty infiltration of the teres minor less than or equal to stage 2 was associated with a better postoperative constant score (67 vs 53, P = .015); age-adjusted constant score (78% vs 59%, P = .012); active external rotation (36 degrees vs 16 degrees , P = .016); and active elevation (143 degrees vs 115 degrees , P = .012) relative to patients with fatty infiltration greater than stage 2. The presence or absence of a tear of the tendon had no significant effect on outcome. In conclusion, when performing LDTT for massive irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tears, fatty infiltration of the teres minor should be considered prior to surgery, as it is predictive of outcome."

CD009020,0,17931909,0,Arthroscopic prevalence of pulley lesions in 1007 consecutive patients.,"This study retrospectively analyzed 1007 diagnostic shoulder arthroscopies. The study included 72 patients with an arthroscopically verified pulley lesion as the main pathologic finding. Epidemiologic data and arthroscopic findings were evaluated in all patients, and 53 were clinically examined with the Constant score after a minimum follow-up of 2 years. We observed an incidence of 7.1% for pulley lesions. An isolated rupture of the superior glenohumeral ligament (SGHL) was seen in 53 patients (73.6%) and a combined partial articular-side tear of the rotator cuff adjacent to rotator interval in 19 (26.4%). Thirty-one patients (43%) had a history of trauma, whereas 41 (57%) had none. Overall, the mean postoperative Constant score adjusted for age and gender was 80.1% (range, 47%-135%). Patients with a SGHL lesion only (85.7%) exhibited a significant (P = .047) higher age- and gender-adjusted Constant score compared with patients with a combined partial surface tendon tear (73.1%). Our epidemiologic data accentuate the need for careful evaluation of the superolateral aspect of rotator interval to avoid underdiagnosis of pulley lesions at shoulder arthroscopy. Our findings provide evidence that the clinical outcome of isolated SGHL lesions is better compared with combined partial articular-side rotator cuff tear. With respect to the progressive pathologic process of pulley lesions, we recommend an early surgical treatment."
CD009020,0,17931908,0,Long-term functional outcomes after repair of rotator cuff tears correlated with atrophy of the supraspinatus muscles on magnetic resonance images.,"We determined the relationship between atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle and functional outcomes in 27 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears who underwent arthroscopic acromioplasty and mini-open cuff repair. Before surgery, all underwent a physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the involved shoulder. Using image-processing software, we measured the cross-sectional area of the total supraspinatus muscle (including regions of fatty degeneration and atrophy) and of the atrophic supraspinatus muscle on sagittal oblique images obtained about 20 mm proximal to the glenoid surface. The atrophic-to-total ratio (A/T ratio) of these areas was then calculated. We assessed functional outcomes by the Constant and Murley functional score at long-term follow-up. The correlation between the A/T ratios and the functional ratings was statistically analyzed. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between A/T ratios of the supraspinatus muscle and functional outcomes."
CD009020,0,17931904,0,Correlation of atrophy and fatty infiltration on strength and integrity of rotator cuff repairs: a study in thirteen patients.,"In 13 patients, the development of supraspinatus muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration after rotator cuff tendon repair was quantified prospectively via magnetic resonance imaging. Intraoperative electrical nerve stimulation at repair showed that the maximal supraspinatus tension (up to 200 N) strongly correlated with the anatomic cross-sectional muscle area and with muscle fatty infiltration (ranging from 12 N/cm(2) in Goutallier stage 3 to 42 N/cm(2) in Goutallier stage 0). Within 1 year after successful tendon repair (n = 8), fatty infiltration did not recover, and atrophy improved partially at best; however, if the repair failed (n = 5), atrophy and fatty infiltration progressed significantly. The ability of the rotator cuff muscles to develop tension not only correlates with their atrophy but also closely correlates with their degree of fatty infiltration. With current repair techniques, atrophy and fatty infiltration appear to be irreversible, despite successful tendon repair. Unexpectedly, not only weak but also very strong muscles are at risk for repair failure."
CD009020,0,17916487,0,Arthroscopic release of the superior transverse ligament and SLAP refixation in a case of suprascapular nerve entrapment.,"We report a case of suprascapular nerve entrapment at the suprascapular notch combined with a type II SLAP lesion resulting in supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle weakness and shoulder pain in a 27-year-old female professional handball player. The magnetic resonance imaging scan showed significant atrophy of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. Electromyography revealed an isolated proximal lesion of the suprascapular nerve. The patient was treated by an arthroscopic release of the superior transverse ligament and repair of the type II SLAP lesion. Follow-up evaluations were performed 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. The Constant score improved from 51 to 84 points. Electromyography studies 3 and 6 months after surgery showed significant improvement with normal reinnervation of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. To our knowledge, this is the first report of proximal suprascapular nerve entrapment with coincidence of a SLAP lesion that was treated arthroscopically. On the basis of this case, we found that arthroscopic release of the superior transverse ligament is an effective procedure for decompression of the suprascapular nerve. Although it is a technically demanding procedure, the arthroscopic approach has the advantage of detecting concomitant lesions such as SLAP lesions."
CD009020,0,17912520,0,Irreducible anterior dislocation of the shoulder due to soft tissue interposition of subscapularis tendon.,"The shoulder joint is the most unstable joint in the body and is easily dislocated. Anterior shoulder dislocation is the commonest and can be associated with glenoid and humeral fractures. Anterior shoulder dislocations are not infrequently associated with cuff tendon tears; however, anterior shoulder dislocation is easily reducible. Irreducible anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint is uncommon, and this could be due to bony as well as soft tissue causes. Persistent anterior dislocation due to torn subscapularis interposition in the glenohumeral joint is very rare, and only a few operative cases have been reported in the literature. We present MR features of one such case and a literature review."
CD009020,0,17912513,0,Spectrum of shoulder injuries in the baseball pitcher.,"This review describes a range of shoulder injuries experienced by baseball pitchers. It is estimated that more than 57% of pitchers suffer some form of shoulder injury during a playing season. Knowledge of the overhead throwing cycle is crucial for our understanding of these shoulder injuries. Baseball pitchers are prone to rotator cuff tears from tensile overload and impingement. Glenoid labrum degeneration or tears are also common, due to overuse syndrome (micro-instability), internal impingement and microtrauma. An understanding of the lesions involved in overhead throwing is crucial in baseball pitchers, as long-term disability can result from these injuries, sometimes with severe financial consequences to the player."
CD009020,0,17906420,0,Muscle strain of the subscapularis muscle: a case report.,"We report on a case of muscle strain of the subscapularis muscle in a baseball player. An out-fielder (throws right-handed and bats left-handed) hurt his right shoulder while playing baseball. He complained of right-shoulder pain just after he forcefully hit his right hand against the fence in an attempt to jump and catch a flying ball with a glove on the left hand during a baseball game. Fat-suppressed T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the right shoulder joint revealed muscle strain in the middle part of the subscapularis muscle, and the injury was surmised to have occurred on account of eccentric contraction of the subscapularis muscle. The case was considered to have moderate muscle strain, because he had modest muscle weakness with a negative lift-off test. Active stretching exercises were begun just after his first visit to our clinic, and throwing exercises were started 3 weeks later, by when the right-shoulder pain had completely disappeared. Repeat MRIs of the right shoulder joint obtained 4 weeks after his first visit to our clinic revealed a significant reduction of the high-intensity lesions in the subscapularis muscle. Conservative treatment was effective for managing moderate muscle strain of the subscapularis muscle. Muscle strain of the subscapularis muscle should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of shoulder injuries in athletes."
CD009020,0,17901945,0,[The dislocated shoulder prosthesis--an avoidable disaster?].,"Instability after shoulder arthroplasty is a common problem, even though complete dislocations are rare. A distinction can be made between vertical and horizontal instabilities. The most common type of vertical instability is superior migration of the humeral head caused by rotator cuff insufficiency; the shoulder prosthesis should be changed for an inverse prosthesis if the patient is symptomatic. Horizontal instabilities can certainly lead to acute dislocation, but it is far more common for them to result in eccentric loading of the glenoid and in turn to increased wear and loosening. When a prosthesis is first implanted it is essential to reproduce the original bony situation before the deformity caused by arthrosis, arthritis or fracture, as this is the only way to prevent instability. This requires careful preoperative planning including evaluation of CT or MRI scans so that during the operation it will be possible, for example, to reorientate an eccentrically torn glenoid using a bone graft or by eccentric reaming and restore the original torsion. At least as much importance attaches to the treatment of the soft tissue, meaning careful release and later closure of the rotator cuff and capsule complex, as to the bony situation. In the authors' own institution 190 prostheses were implanted between 2000 and 2006 and there were three dislocations (1.6%)."

CD009020,0,17891375,0,[Rotator cuff tears and internal impingement in athletes].,"Knowledge of rotator cuff tears, especially in young people, and their cause has been vastly expanded in recent years. This is reflected in the understanding of the pathogenesis of these lesions and the specific therapy. In contrast to the mostly degenerative tears in older people, the causes in young, active people differ: traumatic disruption, internal impingement due to instability (PSI, ASI), SLAP lesion, and microtraumatic causes may be found. Recently, connections between the different pathologies like internal impingement and the SLAP lesion were shown. For an accurate diagnosis and differentiation between the different pathologies an exact clinical examination and a high-quality MRI scan with intra-articular contrast enhancer is necessary. The final therapy should be planned based on the causative pathology; then good long-term results will be achieved and return to sports is likely. If there is no structural damage, conservative therapy should be initiated. If there is any structural damage, e.g., SLAP lesion or rotator cuff tear, surgical treatment is indicated. Besides a SLAP repair and rotator cuff suturing, care must be given not to miss an accompanying instability. These instabilities should also be corrected, e.g., with arthroscopic ventral capsular plication, otherwise results are worse."

The purpose of this study was to present our MR arthrographic imaging observations of posterior capsular thickening in professional baseball players who present with reduced throwing velocity related to pain and clinical findings of internal rotational deficit of the glenohumeral joint. Our observations of MR imaging features in patients with clinical and arthroscopic manifestations of GIRD lesions include articular surface partial thickness tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons, superoposterior subluxation of the humeral head and SLAP tears of the labrum. Although no empiric standard currently exists for the axial dimension thickness of the shoulder capsule, we have observed a thickened appearance of the posterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament in these patients."

CD009020,0,17728506,0,Ultrasonographic findings of the shoulder in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and comparison with physical examination.,"The objectives of this study were: 1) to identify the ultrasonographic (US) abnormalities and 2) to compare the findings of physical examination with US findings in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with shoulder pain. We studied 30 RA patients. Physical examination was performed systemically as follows: 1) area of tenderness; 2) range of passive and active shoulder motion; 3) impingement tests; 4) maneuvers for determining the location of the tendon lesions. US investigations included the biceps, the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons; the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa; and the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints. Thirty RA patients with 35 painful and 25 non-painful shoulders were examined. The range of motion affected the most by shoulder pain was abduction. The most frequent US finding of shoulder joint was effusion in the long head of the biceps tendon. Among the rotator cuff tendons, subscapularis was the most frequently involved. Tendon tear was also common among non-painful shoulders. Physical examination used for the diagnosis of shoulder pain had low sensitivity and specificity for detecting abnormalities in the rheumatoid shoulder joint. In conclusion, US abnormalities showed frequent tendon tears in our RA patients. Physical examination had low sensitivity and specificity for detecting rotator cuff tear in the rheumatoid shoulder joint."
CD009020,0,17713757,0,[Imaging in evaluating rotator cuff tears].,"Diagnostic imaging in a patient with shoulder pain should be used only after a comprehensive clinical evaluation of the shoulder. X-ray and ultrasonography are the basic diagnostic tools; computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be used only with certain indications. Ultrasonography and MRI have comparable accuracy for identifying and measuring full-thickness rotator cuff tears, but the accuracy for identifying partial-thickness still needs to be improved. MR arthrography has significantly improved sensitivity and specificity for partial-thickness tears of the cuff. Only ultrasound provides a real-time examination tool during shoulder movements. Moreover, dynamic ultrasonography can assess the contraction patterns of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, which may improve decision making in the treatment of shoulder diseases. In depicting fatty atrophy of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, MRI remains the reference standard. MRI should not be used as a diagnostic screening tool in patients with chronic shoulder pain because it does not appear to significantly affect treatment or outcome."
CD009020,0,17704907,0,[Management of isolated subscapularis tendon tears].,"Isolated subscapularis tendon tears are rare and often of traumatic origin. Despite specific clinical tests and exact radiological tools (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging), these tendon ruptures are often overlooked. For restoration of normal biomechanical joint function, immediate operative reconstruction is recommended. Tears of the upper subscapularis and partial articular-side tendon can be safely managed arthroscopically. The biceps tendon is often involved, and adequate treatment with tenotomy or tenodesis must be given to prevent postoperative pain. Complete subscapularis tendon avulsions should be reconstructed with an open repair technique. Immediate surgical management provides better results than delayed repair."

CD009020,0,17681214,0,Arthroscopic grafting of greater tuberosity cyst and rotator cuff repair.,"Cysts of the greater tuberosity can be a normal finding independent of age and concurrent rotator cuff tear. The presence of a large greater tuberosity cyst can present a challenge at the time of rotator cuff repair. We present a 1-step arthroscopic technique to address these defects at the time of rotator cuff repair using a synthetic graft (OsteoBiologics, San Antonio, TX) originally designed to address osteoarticular defects. With the viewing portal established laterally, a portal allowing perpendicular access to the cyst is established. The cyst is thoroughly debrided, and a drill sleeve is then introduced perpendicular to the surrounding bone, serving as a guide for the matching drill to create a circular socket. A correspondingly sized TruFit BGS cylindrical implant (OsteoBiologics) is then implanted by use of the included instrumentation. The scaffold is placed flush with the surrounding bone. Because our arthroscopic rotator cuff protocol uses a tension-band technique with placement of suture anchors distal and lateral to the rotator cuff footprint, we are subsequently able to proceed with routine rotator cuff repair."

CD009020,0,17671016,0,Stabilization of the long head of the biceps tendon in the context of early repair of traumatic subscapularis tendon tears.,"Tears of the subscapularis tendon commonly are associated with instability of the long head of the biceps tendon. Standard surgical treatment includes tenodesis or tenotomy of the biceps tendon. However, chronic discomfort from spasms and cosmetic disadvantages have been reported following both procedures, while the potential for functional impairments remains controversial. We investigated the outcome of stabilization of the long head of the biceps tendon in the context of early repair of traumatic tears of the subscapularis tendon."
CD009020,0,17665351,0,Shoulder: what the orthopaedic doctor needs to know.,Diagnosing shoulder pathology accurately requires both clinical expertise and the ability to interpret and correlate radiographic studies. Variational anatomy of the shoulder combined with the complexity of physical examination makes this difficult. Physical examination of the shoulder often leaves the surgeon with more than one working diagnosis. Imaging studies of the shoulder are more valuable if used to confirm a working diagnosis as opposed to reading the study in a vacuum. Clinical correlation should also be considered for any and all findings on an imaging study. Collaboration of the surgeon and the radiologist is essential in reducing the number of over-reported findings that are clinically insignificant. The surgeon should directly communicate with the radiologist as to his or her working diagnosis and the goal of the study. In this way the surgeon and radiologist become superior diagnosticians.

CD009020,0,17629505,0,Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: prospective functional outcome and repair integrity at minimum 2-year follow-up.,"The purpose of this study was to assess arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively with both patient-derived and objective outcome measures, including the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to evaluate repair status. Evaluated were 49 shoulders in 47 consecutive patients. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Constant and Murley score, Simple Shoulder Test, Rowe score, Visual Analog Pain Scale, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 Mental Component Scale all improved significantly (P < .001) between the preoperative and final follow-up evaluations. MRI found 22% of repairs had recurrent tears. The presence of a recurrent tear correlated significantly with patient age (P < .009) and extension of the tear to the infraspinatus (P < .009). Active forward flexion, abduction, external rotation, and strength in forward flexion correlated inversely with the presence of a recurrent tear (P < .05). At minimum 2-year follow-up, arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears produced significant improvements in both patient-derived and objectively measured variables."
CD009020,0,17624527,0,Imaging in shoulder disorders.,"Clinical assessment of the patient with shoulder symptoms can usually localize the cause to one of a few syndromes, each associated with specific imaging questions. MRI is used as the primary form of investigation for recurrent dislocation, SLAP lesions and PSI, as well as articular cartilage, synovial disease, tumours and infection. Ultrasound plays the leading role in impingement, acromioclavicular disease, dynamic assessment and guided therapy. Both techniques are reported to play a role in adhesive capsulitis. In our hospital, approximately four times as many shoulder ultrasound examinations as shoulder MRI are carried out, but elsewhere these proportions will vary according to the prevalence of clinical syndromes in the population being treated."
CD009020,0,17622545,0,Biceps long head tendon revisited: a case report of split tendon arising from single origin.,"A 27-year-old, right-hand-dominant woman with a posttraumatic anterior shoulder dislocation 3 months earlier after traffic accident presented because of pain and limited range of motion in the right shoulder. On physical examination, the patient had negative instability tests and a sulcus sign. On arthroscopic examination, a bifurcate long biceps tendon with two limbs was observed about 1 cm distal to the origin in the supraglenoid tubercle. We found no evidence of a tear in the long biceps tendon on probing, and the margin of each limb was smooth and round. Although this anatomic variant may be benign, its presence might be associated with other shoulder pathology. It is interesting to speculate whether the aberrant biceps anatomy in our patient contributed to transfer of injury at dislocation to the rotator cuff rather than to the classic anterior-inferior capsulolabral complex. In addition, recognition of the described anatomic variant on arthroscopy can aid the shoulder surgeon in focusing treatment on the actual pathology."
CD009020,0,17606793,0,The outcome and structural integrity of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with use of the double-row suture anchor technique.,The reported rate of failure after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has varied widely.

CD009020,0,17574875,0,Biologic augmentation of rotator cuff tendon repair.,"It is known that a histologically normal insertion site does not regenerate after rotator cuff tendon-to-bone repair. Cytokines play an important role in cell chemotaxis, proliferation, matrix synthesis, and cell differentiation and may thus improve rotator tendon-to-bone healing. We have used a sheep infraspinatus repair model to evaluate the effect of osteoinductive growth factors (bone morphogenetic protein [BMP] 2, BMP-7, transforming growth factor [TGF] beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, and fibroblast growth factor) and BMP-12 on tendon-to-bone healing. We have found that these molecules improve formation of new bone and fibrocartilage at the healing tendon attachment site, resulting in improved load to failure. Several other avenues have the potential to augment repair site biology. For example, because platelets are known to contain various cytokines, they may be isolated from autologous blood and could provide an effective method by which to deliver growth factors to a rotator cuff tendon repair site. Furthermore, modalities that improve local vascularity, such as low-intensity pulsed ultrasound or nitroglycerine, have the potential to augment rotator cuff repair healing. Finally, important information about the biology of tendon healing can be gained from studies of substances that inhibit healing, such as nicotine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications."

A total of 120 patients with shoulder pain were prospectively studied. The physical examination of shoulders was performed as follows: (1) the area of tenderness; (2) the range of passive and active motion for abduction, forward flexion, external rotation, and internal rotation; (3) Neer and Hawkins's tests for shoulder impingement; and (4) maneuvers for determining the location of the tendon lesions. Transverse and longitudinal planes from the long head of the biceps, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons, the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa, and the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints were included for US examination. The range of motion most affected by shoulder pain was abduction, followed by external rotation and forward flexion. The most frequent US finding was effusion in the long head of the biceps tendon. Among the rotator cuff tendons, supraspinatus was the most frequently involved. Physical examination had low sensitivity and specificity for the detection of tendon tear. US examination leads to an anatomical diagnosis of shoulder pain in many patients. Whether the US examination of the painful shoulder improves its treatment should be investigated."

On physical examination they were found to have a painful shoulder and loss of strength on endorotation of the right arm. Ultrasound examination of the shoulder revealed subscapular tendon rupture in both patients, this was confirmed by MRI scan in the first patient. Treatment was operative repair of the tendon by a deltopectoral approach, followed by wearing a exorotation-limiting sling. After six months the first patient was free of complaints and the second patient was still experiencing pain when laying on the right shoulder. An isolated traumatic rupture of the subscapular tendon is uncommon and is often misdiagnosed or only discovered later. This diagnostic delay negatively influences the success of operative treatment. Focusing attention on the typical trauma mechanism, the character of the symptoms and the use of simple physical examination such as the lift-offtest or the belly press test can lead to the correct diagnosis."

Therefore, we thought that the quantitative assessment of the supraspinatous would be better if made in comparison with a standard of reference such as the deltoid. Consequently, we performed a two-part study, first evaluating supraspinatous changes compared with the deltoid in ""normals"" with aging, and second, determining if in patients with cuff tears the supraspinatous fat exceeds that of the deltoid."
CD009020,0,17507248,0,Experiences with sheep as an animal model for shoulder surgery: strengths and shortcomings.,"Sheep (and goats) are a convenient large-animal model for rotator cuff repair because of availability, ease of handling and housing, animal cost, and acceptance to society as a research animal. Tenotomy of the infraspinatus tendon and subsequent reattachment to the proximal humerus is useful to address the biomechanical, histologic, and biochemical processes of rotator cuff repair. Detaching this tendon and immediately reattaching it does not represent the clinical picture but serves as a relatively rapid way to screen different suture anchors, suture patterns, scaffolds, growth factors, and other biologics or a combination of these treatments to enhance the healing process. To minimize spontaneous reattachment and reproduce a chronic rotator cuff injury, the end of the tendon can be covered and then reattached 4 weeks later if bone-to-tendon healing is to be evaluated. This chronic model is useful to understand the biology (degree of muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration) of rotator cuff muscles as well as innovative methods of repair. Close-stall confinement is required during the convalescence in acute and chronic studies. Ultrasound in the awake animal can be used to monitor gap formation and tissue organization. Sheep have also been used to determine whether capsular healing after plication is equivalent to open capsular shift."
CD009020,0,17504318,0,MR shoulder arthrography in patients younger than 40 years of age: frequency of rotator cuff tear versus labroligamentous pathology.,"The purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of rotator cuff pathology versus labroligamentous pathology in patients younger than 40 years and to determine whether routine MR arthrography is justified in all patients in this age group, regardless of the clinical symptoms. The MR arthrography was carried out on 332 patients 40 years of age and younger. Two hundred and forty-three patients had clinical history of instability and possible labroligamentous pathology. Eighty-nine patients had no history or physical signs of instability and were referred for reasons other than instability, such as assessment for rotator cuff tear. In the 243 patients younger than 40 years with clinical history of potential labral pathology, 39% (95/243) showed a labral tear and 2.1% (5/243) had a full-thickness rotator cuff tendon tear. In the 89 patients with no history suggesting labral pathology, 19% (17/89) showed an unsuspected labral tear and 4.5% (4/89) had a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. These findings suggest that, regardless of the clinical indication for referral, patients aged 40 and less referred for shoulder MRI should be imaged using MR arthrography because of the significant risk that symptoms are related to unsuspected labral pathology."
CD009020,0,17504312,1,Diagnostic accuracy of shoulder ultrasound performed by a single operator.,"Both diagnostic ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for investigation of the presence and severity of rotator cuff lesions. There is no consensus as to which is the more accurate and cost-effective study. We sought to examine the sensitivity of ultrasound, when used by one experienced radiologist with modern equipment. We compared the ultrasound and surgical results obtained from 68 patients. Ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100% (Positive Predictive Value 100%) for full-thickness tears, and a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 94% (Positive Predictive Value 87%) for partial-thickness tears. We found that shoulder ultrasound, in the hands of an experienced radiologist with the use of modern high-resolution equipment, is highly sensitive in differentiating complete tears and partial-thickness tears. Our results are similar to the best published results for MRI and given that ultrasound is significantly cheaper and more available, ultrasound by an experienced radiologist should be considered as a primary diagnostic tool for imaging the rotator cuff."

The patient was a sedentary 73-y-old Caucasian woman. Investigation revealed an acute, full-thickness tear of the right supraspinatus secondary to performing a shoulder press exercise. Further investigation via MRI revealed degenerative disease of the acromioclavicular joint including lateral downsloping of the acromion and an anteroinferior acromial spur, which would presdispose to impingement. Conservative management was implemented in this case for over 6 months with minimal success. The patient remained functionally limited in virtually all activities of daily living. Given the medical history, health status, physical condition, and age of our patient, it is probable that degenerative changes predisposed the patient to the injury. To our knowledge this is the first published report of an older adult sustaining a rotator cuff tear during PRT."

After a head injury, the hemodynamically stable patient became febrile and grew cultures of Clostridium perfringens with no identifiable focus. Antibiotics were initiated. Seventy-two hours after culture results, the patient complained of shoulder pain and imaging revealed periscapular subcutaneous emphysema.

Both ultrasound and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging present unique advantages in evaluation of the postoperative tissue. MR imaging has superior soft tissue contrast and provides a more global shoulder assessment, including the degree of arthrosis, while ultrasound enables a more dynamic testing of the repaired tissue. Power Doppler ultrasound and new contrast agents provide insight into the degree of vascular recruitment following repair."
CD009020,0,17441667,0,Glenoid osteolysis after arthroscopic labrum repair with a bioabsorbable suture anchor.,"Bioabsorbable suture anchors are commonly used for arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff and labrum lesions. They provide soft-tissue attachment to bone. They have been introduced to avoid complications such as artefacts on MRI scans, commonly seen with metal anchors. However, bioabsorbable implants may lead to other problems such as local osteolysis, cyst formation, soft tissue inflammation and release of implant fragments into the joint space. The author describes the case of a professional female volleyball player, who presented osteolysis of the superior pole of the glenoid after arthroscopic repair of a SLAP lesion with a PLLA suture anchor. This is the first reported case of glenoid osteolysis after arthroscopic insertion of a bioabsorbable suture anchor.

CD009020,0,17418345,0,Arthroscopic treatment of a massive acromioclavicular joint cyst.,"A healthy 75-year-old man presented with a 9-month history of an enlarging painless shoulder mass. On examination, there was a 10 x 10 cm firm mass overlying the acromioclavicular (AC) joint. The active range of motion of the shoulder joint was 130 degrees of forward elevation, 90 degrees of abduction, 60 degrees of abduction and internal rotation to the level of the waist. There was weakness of the rotator cuff. Plain radiographs showed degenerative changes of the AC joint with superior migration of the humeral head. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large cyst arising from a degenerative AC joint with an associated major tear of both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Arthroscopy of the AC joint and debridement of the cyst was performed in the lateral decubitus position. The major rotator cuff tear of supraspinatus and infraspinatus was confirmed. A conservative subacromial decompression and AC joint excision arthroplasty was performed. As the superior AC ligament was opened, dark brown gelatinous material was seen emanating from the cyst. A thorough debridement of the cyst was performed until the lavage fluid was clear. At last follow-up 6 months after surgery, the shoulder remained asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence of the cyst. Arthroscopic treatment of a massive AC joint cyst allows assessment of associated pathology, is minimally invasive, and allows early rehabilitation."

CD009020,0,17410365,0,Deltoid detachment consequent to open surgical repair of massive rotator cuff tears.,"Deltoid detachment is one of the complications in open rotator cuff repair. Although it is often described, the actual prevalence, time at which it occurs and the predisposing causes are still unknown. We prospectively studied 112 patients with massive rotator cuff tears with a mean age of 67. The surgical approach was performed with a lateral para-acromial incision. Clinical assessment was performed with Constant's method. Of the 112 patients, 9 (8%) had deltoid detachment. It occurred about 3 months after surgery. Of the nine patients, two underwent revision surgery for the deltoid trans-bone reattachment. At the follow-up, the patients with deltoid detachment had a mean increase of only 5.5 points in the Constant score compared to that of 16.9 obtained by the control group. Deltoid reattachment, performed on the two patients, provided a mean increase of 7 points only with respect to the post-operative control at the 4th month. Considering the unsatisfactory functional result consequent to deltoid detachment and the slight improvement obtained with the reattachment, we recommend the following: use suture thread thicker than #2, do not use a simple stitch and avoid extending acromioplasty to the lateral margin of the acromion."
CD009020,0,17408977,0,The influence of medial reattachment of the torn cuff tendon for retracted rotator cuff tears.,"We reattached the torn rotator cuff medial to the anatomic cuff insertion site if it was retracted. The purpose was to correlate the amount of medial reattachment of the cuff with shoulder function. We evaluated 63 shoulders in which repaired cuffs were followed with magnetic resonance imaging at a mean follow-up of 8 years. The amount of medial reattachment of the cuff tendon was determined by use of a T2-weighted oblique coronal view, which passed through the center of the humeral head, and was defined as the NCA angle (where N indicates the new cuff insertion point, C indicates the center of the humeral head, and A indicates the anatomic cuff insertion point). Theoretically, the more medially the cuff tendon was reattached, the greater the NCA angle. Neither the Japanese Orthopaedic Association shoulder score nor isometric strength of forward elevation was correlated with the NCA angle. The NCA angle was significantly correlated (P = .001) with the active forward elevation angle, which dramatically decreased at 30 degrees of the NCA angle, approximately 13 mm from the original cuff insertion point, assuming a humeral head radius of 25 mm."

Animal studies of the Restore Orthobiologic Implant, a collagen-based material derived from the small intestine mucosa of pigs, have indicated that it might be used to help overcome such problems. We carried out a study to determine whether patients who received this xenograft to augment a rotator cuff repair exhibited greater shoulder strength, shoulder function, and/or resistance to retearing."
CD009020,0,17403336,0,[Magnetic resonance imaging of glenohumeral instability: new concepts].,"The shoulder is the most unstable joint in the human body and is therefore susceptible not only to acute dislocations but also to minimal states of subluxation related to overuse. The latter condition is known as microinstability and is translated clinically into internal impingement syndromes. Both in dislocations due to acute traumatism and in microinstability, a series of injuries to the glenoid lip, glenohumeral capsule, the articular cartilage, the head of the humerus, the tendons of the rotator cuff, the long tendon of the biceps, the glenohumeral ligaments, and coracohumeral ligament can occur. Glenoid lip lesions are the most common and may present as isolated lesions or in combination with lesions of any of the other structures. These lesions most often affect the anteroinferior margin of the glenoids (the classic Bankard lesion), with different characteristics and variations on its location, (Bankard variants). Another predominant location of glenoid lip lesions is the superior margin (SLAP lesions). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially after intra-articular injection of contrast material, has shown great diagnostic accuracy in this type of lesions, although the interpretation of these images requires knowledge not only of the different lesions and combinations of lesions, but also of the normal variants that can easily be confused with these lesions."
CD009020,0,17398265,0,MRI of the rotator interval of the shoulder.,"The rotator interval of the shoulder joint is located between the distal edges of the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons and contains the insertions of the coracohumeral and superior glenohumeral ligaments. These structures form a complex pulley system that stabilizes the long head of the biceps tendon as it enters the bicipital groove of the humeral head. The rotator interval is the site of a variety of pathological processes including biceps tendon lesions, adhesive capsulitis and anterosuperior internal impingement. This article describes the anatomy, function and pathology of the rotator interval using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."
CD009020,0,17393674,0,The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of glenohumeral articular degenerative disease.,"Degenerative joint disease is a major source of disability in the world with over 43 million individuals suffering from the affliction in the United States alone. It is the most common cause of activity limitation in individuals over 65 years of age. While much of the focus in recent years has been on osteoarthritis of the hips and knees, shoulder degenerative disease is becoming a more commonly recognized source of morbidity with a wide range of associated lifestyle-limiting disabilities. At the same time therapeutic options for treatment of degenerative joint disease are rapidly increasing, both medically and surgically. This combination of factors makes it necessary to determine a reliable, noninvasive means by which to accurately diagnose the early changes of shoulder degenerative disease. The clinical diagnosis of shoulder osteoarthritis is extremely challenging. There are numerous existing mimickers such as rotator cuff injuries, bursitis, and impingement syndrome. While the conventional radiographic findings are well recognized, they are generally late developments in the course of the disease when therapeutic options are more limited and less effective. Additionally, plain film evaluation has poor sensitivity for the detection of many of the alternative diagnoses that may underlie chronic shoulder pain. Though correlative findings are seen in MR imaging, its role in evaluating glenohumeral degenerative changes has been limited, with much of the focus being on the identification of tendinous and ligamentous disease or osseous tumors. A retrospective analysis is presented which demonstrates the efficacy of MR imaging in assessing GHJ OA, as well as shows that dedicated evaluation for specific degenerative findings results in improved detection rates of GHJ degenerative disease. It is believed that with improved detection and reporting, improved clinical care for this prevalent disorder may be achieved."

The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from each subject. Forty-two patients (mean age 55.5 years; age range 40-73 years) with supraspinatus tendon tears and 50 asymptomatic shoulders of 32 controls (mean age 43 years; age range 17-69 years) without rotator cuff tears were included. The acromio-glenoid and supraspinatus-glenoid angles were measured on coronal images, the glenoid and humeral head version as well as the bicipital-humeral distance on axial images. Significant differences were found between the patients and controls for both glenoid version and bicipital-humeral distance, which are considered to influence the distribution of forces placed on the cuff (p < 0.05). The patients had a decreased glenoid version by an average of 2.3 degrees (-7.1 +/- 7.8 degrees vs. -4.8 +/- 5.6 degrees), and a decreased bicipital-humeral distance by an average of 2.7 mm (12.1 +/- 3.7 mm vs. 14.8 +/- 4.1 mm). No significant differences were found between these groups for humeral head version and the acromio-glenoid and supraspinatus-glenoid angles, which might contribute to extrinsic impingement by narrowing the supraspinatus tendon outlet. Differences in glenoid and humeral version may be responsible for RC tears by changing the orientation of the rotator cuff and thus increasing shearing stress."

We retrospectively identified 35 patients treated for this cuff lesion among 378 open repaired full-thickness cuff tears. The aim of the study was to assess the subjective, objective, and anatomic outcomes of a subset of patients with supraspinatus tears involving delamination of the whole infraspinatus tendon. Thirty of the 35 patients were reviewed with magnetic resonance imaging at a minimum followup of 2 years (mean, 3.5 years; range, 2-6.5 years). The mean nonweighted Constant-Murley score at followup was 80/100 points, with an average gain of 17 points. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed all supraspinatus tendons but two were continuous. We observed no tear of the infraspinatus tendon, although a persistent delamination was present in 11 cases. One half of the patients had minor weakness in external rotation. One third of the infraspinatus muscles had minor fatty infiltration. Conservation of the infraspinatus tendon after closing the delamination did not seem to compromise the outcome of the supraspinatus repair. Avoiding resection of the infraspinatus delamination and treatment with simple curettage and closure yields satisfactory midterm functional and anatomic results."

CD009020,0,17157744,0,Rhabdomyolysis following shoulder arthroscopy.,"Fluid extravasation is not uncommon after shoulder arthroscopy. We report a case of massive fluid extravasation that resulted in rhabdomyolysis and renal shutdown following routine shoulder arthroscopic surgery. Compartment pressures in the deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder revealed extensive subcutaneous edema and high-signal changes in the entire deltoid muscle. The patient made an uneventful recovery with adequate supportive treatment and renal dialysis. Repeat imaging studies 3 months later revealed complete restoration to normal of the deltoid muscle. In addition to extensive fluid extravasation in this patient, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, the development of a transient allergic reaction to a prescribed antibiotic, and the inclusion of epinephrine in the infusion fluid may have collectively contributed to rhabdomyolysis. We recommend that the use of infusion pumps should be limited to the shortest time possible, and that gravity inflow should be used as much as possible. Inflow should preferably occur through the arthroscope itself, rather than through a separate portal cannula, which may dislodge, inadvertently causing infusion of high-pressure fluid into the surrounding tissue."

Although often asymptomatic, they can be significantly disabling. Overhead throwing athletes with partial-thickness rotator cuff tears differ with respect to etiology, goals, and treatment from older, nonathlete patients with degenerative tears. Pathogenesis of degenerative partial-thickness tears is multifactorial, with evidence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors playing key roles. Diagnosis of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears should be based on the patient's symptoms together with magnetic resonance imaging studies. Conservative treatment is successful in most patients. Surgery generally is considered for patients with symptoms of sufficient duration and intensity. The role of acromioplasty has not been clearly delineated, but it should be considered when there is evidence of extrinsic causation for the partial-thickness rotator cuff tear."

CD009020,0,17139865,0,[Shoulder pain: imaging examinations].,"Non-traumatic shoulder pain is a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Usually, the clinical examination is supplemented by nowadays well-defined imaging studies. Radiography is the first examination to be requested on a systematic basis. It always includes several views to study the whole scapular region (glenohumeral joint, subacromial space, acromioclavicular joint etc.). If the radiographic examination is not precise enough, a noninvasive and non-irradiating examination is performed, either ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. The latter seems to be more comprehensive than ultrasonography. However, the usefulness of the association radiography-ultrasonography should be emphasized: both examinations are perfectly complementary, inexpensive and easy to access. Invasive examinations, such as CT arthrography, are still too often requested following a radiological examination. Since they do not investigate the whole shoulder, they should be limited to the investigation of specific diseases, often as part of presurgical assessments required for or by the orthopedic surgeon."
CD009020,0,17139864,0,[Diagnostic strategy for shoulder pathology?].,"Faced to shoulder pathology, the way of investigating must be very systematic. Before doing sophisticated explorations (arthroCT, MRI), we first have to use the triad ""interrogatory-clinical examination-standard X Rays"". This first step is absolutely necessary; it must allow to make the diagnosis to which the therapy must be adapted. The rotator cuff pathology is the most frequent one. Its frequency depends on patient's age, precessive trauma or not and the pratice of activities using the arm up (sports, leasures, works). A stiff shoulder must never be neglected, the diagnosis is done by clinical examination and its origine is very often precised by standard Xrays. Others diagnosis are done by the conjunction of several elements (pathologic context, clinical examination, standard Xrays). In some complex situations, other investigations (US, arthroCT, MRI) will be needed."

""Uncoverage"" of the humeral head by the anterolateral acromion was defined as the percentage of the humeral head width not covered superiorly by the anterolateral acromion, as measured digitally on magnetic resonance imaging scans of the shoulder in the oblique coronal plane. The uncoverage of the humeral head by the anterolateral acromion was 32.0% for men > or = 40 years of age with normal rotator cuffs (n = 39) and 38.2% for men > or = 40 years of age with full-thickness rotator cuff tears (n = 43).

We studied retraction of the musculotendinous unit 35 weeks later using CT, MRI and macroscopic dissection. The tendon was retracted by a mean of 4.7 cm (3.8 to 5.1) 40 weeks after release and remained at a mean of 4.2 cm (3.3 to 4.7) 35 weeks after the repair. Retraction of the muscle was only a mean of 2.7 cm (2.0 to 3.3) and 1.7 cm (1.1 to 2.2) respectively at these two points. Thus, the musculotendinous junction had shifted distally by a mean of 2.5 cm (2.0 to 2.8) relative to the tendon. Sheep muscle showed an ability to compensate for approximately 60% of the tendon retraction in a hitherto unknown fashion. Such retraction may not be a quantitatively reliable indicator of retraction of the muscle and may overestimate the need for elongation of the musculotendinous unit during repair."

Of 1345 patients who underwent rotator cuff repair in a 7-year period, 73 had either an isolated rupture of the subscapularis or a subscapularis rupture combined with rupture of the supraspinatus. All reconstructions were performed through a deltopectoral approach. Reinsertion of the subscapularis was combined with reconstruction of the supraspinatus in 32 patients. Of the patients, 63 (86%) were re-examined at a mean follow-up of 35 months. The modified Constant score improved from 62% preoperatively to 91% at follow-up. Isolated or combined reconstructions did not result in significant differences with respect to the Constant score. Of the patients, 62 (98%) were satisfied with the operation.

Twenty-two children with a mean age of 3.9 years (range, 1.6-8.3 years) underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, arthroscopic surgery with or without tendon transfers, and postoperative imaging in their spica cast. In the uninvolved shoulders, the mean percentage of the humeral head anterior to the middle of the glenoid fossa (PHHA) was 45.2% +/- 4.8% and the mean glenoid version was -7% +/- 3%. In the involved shoulders, preoperatively, the mean PHHA was 15.6% +/- 13.5% and the mean glenoid version was -37 degrees +/- 15 degrees . Postoperatively, the mean PHHA corrected to 46.9% +/- 11.2% and the mean glenoid version improved to -8 degrees +/- 8 degrees . There was a significant improvement in the mean PHHA (P < .001) and mean glenoid version (P < .001) that approached the values of the uninvolved shoulder. Arthroscopic capsular release and subscapularis tenotomy were successful in obtaining reduction of glenohumeral joint subluxation in all patients.

The relative ratio of the subtracted standardized uptake value on the supraspinatus with a torn supraspinatus tendon to that of the subscapularis on the ipsilateral side was significantly lower than that on the normal side (0.69 +/- 0.05 versus 1.06 +/- 0.36). The relative ratio of the infraspinatus on the rupture side was also significantly lower than that on the normal side (0.91 +/- 0.09 versus 1.41 +/- 0.35). However, by 6 months postoperative, the reduced glucose metabolism in these muscles had recovered to the same levels as those on the normal side. As indicated by FDG PET, muscle metabolism in rotator cuff tears was reduced, subsequently recovering to the level of the normal side after operative repair."

CD009020,0,17027418,0,Calcific tendonitis of the subscapularis tendon causing subcoracoid stenosis and coracoid impingement.,"Calcific tendonitis is a common disease of the shoulder which usually responds to conservative treatment. In cases unresponsive to conservative management, arthroscopic treatment is sometimes required. While there are several reports on calcifications within the supraspinatus tendon, documented cases involving the subscapularis tendon are rare. We present a case of a 47 year old farmer with recurrent anterior shoulder pain. An MRI revealed calcium deposits as well as a large subcoracoid cyst. Arthroscopic excision of the multiple calcific deposits left a large defect in the subscapularis tendon which was repaired back to the lesser tuberosity using arthroscopic techniques. A coracoplasty resulted in an increased coracohumeral space. The patient followed a conservative postop rehabilitation protocol and ultimately regained full strength and was pain free at the latest follow-up. We postulate two possible etiologies of subscapularis calcific tendonitis: either an idiopathic calcific tendonitis caused a secondary coracoid impingement or a primary subcoracoid stenosis resulted in an interstitial subscapularis tear which eventually resulted in calcium deposition. This report describes the clinical and technical details of arthroscopic excision of calcific deposits of the subscapularis tendon as well as arthroscopic repair of the resulting subscapularis defect."

Twenty-three children with an average age at surgery of 5.3 +/- 1.7 years underwent transfer of the latissimus dorsi and teres major to the posterior rotator cuff with or without concomitant musculotendinous lengthenings. Preoperative MRI revealed glenoid retroversion measuring -25.3 +/- 14.3 degrees and only 29.5 +/- 15.5% percent of humeral head anterior to the middle of the glenoid. Clinical evaluation showed significant improvements in external rotation and abduction. Postoperative MRI 1 year after surgery revealed no change in glenoid retroversion (-24.5 +/- 14.2) or percent of humeral head anterior to the middle of the glenoid (28.4 +/- 14.9%). These results demonstrate that tendon transfers improve overall shoulder motion but do not reduce humeral head subluxation or enhance glenohumeral joint realignment.

We included 23 patients (30 shoulders), who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty in the study. The evaluation included a standard history and physical examination, ultrasound evaluation, and outcome questionnaires. The postoperative examination included careful documentation of an abdominal-compression test to evaluate subscapularis function. All patients had an improvement in functional outcome scores and shoulder range of motion. Of 30 shoulders, 26 (87%) had an intact subscapularis as determined by ultrasound. By use of ultrasound as the gold standard, the abdominal-compression test had 7 false-positive results, 3 false-negative results, 19 true-negative results, and 1 true-positive result. The sensitivity of the abdominal-compression test was 25%, and the specificity was 73%. The negative predictive value was 86%, and the positive predictive value was 13%. The abdominal-compression test demonstrated a low sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value in this study for the assessment of subscapularis function after total shoulder arthroplasty.

CD009020,0,16969638,1,Rotator cuff tears: assessment with MR arthrography in 275 patients with arthroscopic correlation.,"We assessed the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography in the diagnosis of articular-sided partial-thickness and full-thickness rotator cuff tears in a large symptomatic population. MR arthrograms obtained in 275 patients including a study group of 139 patients with rotator cuff tears proved by arthroscopy and a control group of 136 patients with arthroscopically intact rotator cuff tendons were reviewed in random order. MR imaging was performed on a 1.0 T system (Magnetom Expert, Siemens). MR arthrograms were analyzed by two radiologists in consensus for articular-sided partial-thickness and full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons. At arthroscopy, 197 rotator cuff tears were diagnosed, including 105 partial-thickness (93 supraspinatus, nine infraspinatus, three subscapularis) and 92 full-thickness (43 supraspinatus, 20 infraspinatus, 29 subscapularis) tendon tears. For full-thickness tears, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 96%, 99%, and 98%, respectively, and for partial tears 80%, 97%, and 95%, respectively. False negative and positive assessments in the diagnosis of articular-sided partial-thickness tears were predominantly [78% (35/45)] observed with small articular-sided (Ellman grade1) tendon tears. MR arthrography is highly accurate in the diagnosis of full-thickness rotator cuff tears and is accurate in the diagnosis of articular-sided partial-thickness tears. Limitations in the diagnosis of partial-thickness tears are mainly restricted to small articular-sided tears (Ellman grade 1) due to difficulties in differentiation between fiber tearing, tendinitis, synovitic changes, and superficial fraying at tendon margins."
CD009020,0,16958438,0,Diagnosis and management of massive rotator cuff tears: the surgeon's dilemma.,"Several studies have documented high success rates following the surgical treatment of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Historically, however, less favorable and predictable results have been found in the treatment of massive tears (>5 cm) compared with small and medium sized tears. Determining the most appropriate treatment for a patient with a massive rotator cuff tear can be challenging because of inconsistent outcome results. Some patients function well with nonsurgical treatment of massive tears, some have initially favorable results from surgical débridement of tears without repair that then deteriorate over time, and other patients who are surgically treated continue to maintain good function despite documented retears. Nonsurgical treatment of massive rotator cuff tears may be suitable for elderly patients with chronic tears and limited functional goals below shoulder level. Surgical débridement without repair of the tear may be considered for patients with low physical demands whose predominant symptom is pain. Surgical repair is recommended for patients who require maximal postoperative function, particularly for overhead activities. Open repairs have a lower rate of rerupture than arthroscopic repairs; however, arthroscopic repair offers the benefits of decreased morbidity and decreased risk of postoperative deltoid detachment. Early studies of arthroscopic repairs have shown good functional results; however, there has been a high incidence of retears. Tendon transfers and other reconstruction techniques may offer improvements in certain salvage cases, but results of these procedures are inferior to those for primary repair. Preservation of the coracoacromial arch should be considered in all forms of treatment of massive rotator cuff tears to avoid the devastating complication of superior humeral head escape."
CD009020,0,16943859,0,Interpreting positive signs of the supraspinatus test in screening for torn rotator cuff.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of the supraspinatus test as a screening test for detecting torn rotator cuff and to determine what its valuable positive signs were. Both the empty-can test and full-can test were performed on 200 shoulders diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-and in some cases, surgical findings-to have full-thickness or partial-thickness torn rotator cuff s, or no tear in the rotator cuff . During the maneuver, the presence of pain or weakness or both pain and weakness were recorded as positive signs, and the distribution of these signs were analyzed according to the degree of tear. The predictive values were calculated in 2 ways by considering (1) only full-thickness tears as tears and (2) both full- and partial-thickness tears as tears. The 2 tests and the 2 ways of considering partial-thickness tears were compared. Pain and weakness were severity-dependent, and the empty-can test had a higher incidence of pain. The sensitivities of the 2 supraspinatus tests in all positive signs were higher when including partial-thickness tears in the tear group ; however, their specificities were higher when excluding partial-thickness tears. Both pain and weakness were interpretive for the supraspinatus test, and both tests were sensitive to full- and partial- thickness tears and specific for full-thickness tears."

Subscapularis tears were underreported in the pre-arthroscopic era. Literature about rotator cuff impairment caused by osteochondromas is almost non-existent. We will present the case of a young man, who had a complete non-traumatic subscapularis tear, where the tendon had been peeled off the lesser tuberosity by an osteochondroma.

CD009020,0,16927071,0,Preliminary results after rotator cuff reconstruction augmented with an autologous periosteal flap.,"Periosteal augmentation of tendons in the course of refixation to bone has been shown to be a suitable method for early primarily stable osteofibroblastic integration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of open rotator cuff reconstruction using an autologous periosteal flap augmentation technique. The research was performed as a prospective cohort study. Twenty-three prospective patients (average age 59.7 years) with degenerative rotator cuff tears were operated on with an open technique and a subtendinous periosteal flap augmentation using bioabsorbable suture anchors and a modified Mason-Allen technique. Clinical evaluation consisted of the Constant-Score and the Simple Shoulder test. Radiological evaluation included standard radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty patients were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 14.4 months. The average Constant Score increased significantly from 51.7 to 80.9 points (p<0.05) with 12 excellent, seven good and one satisfactory result. The Simple Shoulder test showed a significant increase of an average of 4.8-10.7 questions answered with yes (p<0.05). Four patients (20%) demonstrated a retear of the tendon on postoperative MRI. Ectopic ossifications in the supraspinatus tendon were found in four patients (20%) but these had no impact on the final clinical results. Open rotator cuff repair augmented with an autologous periosteal flap shows high patient satisfaction level with low rerupture rates. Mid- and long-term results remain to be seen. The potential benefits compared with conventional open or arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery must be examined in prospective randomized studies."

On average, these cysts measure 10-20 mm in diameter and are located preferentially on the posterosuperior aspect of the glenoid. An articular origin (rim injury) is generally accepted. The pathogenesis is similar to that of meniscal cysts. Depending on the exact localization, there is generally little clinical expression. The most frequent complication involves compression of the suprascapular nerve leading to suffering of the supra and/or infraspinatus. Amyotrophy can occur without clinical expression. An attentive examination is necessary to identify the cyst. EMG is often falsely negative. MRI is currently gold standard diagnostic tool but will probably be improved with arthro-MRI. Ultrasonography and computed tomography can visualize with difficulty small cysts located very close to the bone. The best treatment is arthroscopy which enables complete cure (emptying the cyst and resection or suture of the rim). We present a review of the pertinent literature together with a retrospective series of six cases of paraglenoid glenohumeral ganglion cysts."

CD009020,0,16890886,0,"Pathological muscle activation patterns in patients with massive rotator cuff tears, with and without subacromial anaesthetics.","A mechanical deficit due to a massive rotator cuff tear is generally concurrent to a pain-induced decrease of maximum arm elevation and peak elevation torque. The purpose of this study was to measure shoulder muscle coordination in patients with massive cuff tears, including the effect of subacromial pain suppression. Ten patients, with MRI-proven cuff tears, performed an isometric force task in which they were asked to exert a force in 24 equidistant intervals in a plane perpendicular to the humerus. By means of bi-polar surface electromyography (EMG) the direction of the maximal muscle activation or principal action of six muscles, as well as the external force, were identified prior to, and after subacromial pain suppression. Subacromial lidocaine injection led to a significant reduction of pain and a significant increase in exerted arm force. Prior to the pain suppression, we observed an activation pattern of the arm adductors (pectoralis major pars clavicularis and/or latissimus dorsi and/or teres major) during abduction force delivery in eight patients. In these eight patients, adductor activation was different from the normal adductor activation pattern. Five out of these eight restored this aberrant activity (partly) in one or more adductor muscles after subacromial lidocaine injection. Absence of glenoid directed forces of the supraspinate muscle and compensation for the lost supraspinate abduction torque by the deltoideus leads to destabilizating forces in the glenohumeral joint, with subsequent upward translation of the humeral head and pain. In order to reduce the superior translation force, arm adductors will be co-activated at the cost of arm force and abduction torque. Pain seems to be the key factor in this (avoidance) mechanism, explaining the observed limitations in arm force and limitations in maximum arm elevation in patients suffering subacromial pathologies. Masking this pain may further deteriorate the subacromial tissues as a result of proximal migration of the humeral head and subsequent impingement of subacromial tissues."

Significant difference in all metric parameters (thickness of supraspinatus tendon, diameter of biceps tendon sheet and capsula-bone distance) were noticed between all groups and the symptomatic had the highest values. Asymptomatic had the higher values then volunteers. Inhomogenicity of the tendon and biceps tendon sheet effusion in the symptomatic patients were the most often occurred. Subdeltoid effusion, deposits and tendon rupture were found only in symptomatic patients. No difference in presence of calcifications between symptomatic and asymptomatic was found.

Advances in CT led to the natural development of CT arthrography. Development of MRI and its capability for multiplanar imaging led to direct magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA). This technique has been performed since 1987 and has surpassed CT arthrography in popularity in the United States. Indirect MRA developed subsequently to offer a less invasive alternative.

CD009020,0,16845547,0,"Influence of tendon healing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair on clinical outcome using single-row Mason-Allen suture technique: a prospective, MRI controlled study.","The reported functional results of rotator cuff repair performed arthroscopically have been good. Only little is known about the cuff integrity after arthroscopic repair and how it influences the outcome. The aim of the study is to set a baseline of what rate of healing response respectively re-tears to expect and how cuff integrity alters the outcome. Fifty-three consecutive patients with an isolated supraspinatus tendon tear were arthroscopically operated and their tendons repaired. All pre- and postoperative data were prospectively collected. At a minimum follow-up after 24 months (average 26.4 months), the integrity of the cuff was evaluated by an open magnetic resonance imaging and the patients' function and satisfaction were documented and graded to the sex- and age-related Constant-score also using a dynamometer for strength testing. The re-tear rate was 24.5% with 13 non-healed tendons. The Constant-score of all patients improved significantly. The scores of the patients with a re-tear were significantly lower than those of the patient with an intact cuff. That was due to a less good performance in strength testing. The other categories of the Constant-score did not show any differences. The age of the patients with a re-tear was significantly higher. With the exception of age, we did not find any negative prognostic factor for a re-tear, and with the exception of re-tear no other factor influenced the Constant-score. Arthroscopic supraspinatus tendon repair yields a re-tear rate of 25% which is comparable with the results of open or mini/open repair. Cuff integrity influences postoperative strength and Constant-score. Patients older than 65 years show a higher re-tear rate. Therapeutic Level IV is the level of evidence."
CD009020,0,16844931,0,MR imaging of rotator cuff injury: what the clinician needs to know.,"The rotator cuff muscles generate torque forces to move the humerus while acting in concord to produce balanced compressive forces to stabilize the glenohumeral joint. Thus, rotator cuff tears are often associated with loss of shoulder strength and stability, which are crucial for optimal shoulder function. The dimensions and extent of rotator cuff tears, the condition of the involved tendon, tear morphologic features, involvement of the subscapularis and infraspinatus tendons or of contiguous structures (eg, rotator interval, long head of the biceps brachii tendon, specific cuff tendons), and evidence of muscle atrophy may all have implications for rotator cuff treatment and prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging can demonstrate the extent and configuration of rotator cuff abnormalities, suggest mechanical imbalance within the cuff, and document abnormalities of the cuff muscles and adjacent structures. A thorough understanding of the anatomy and function of the rotator cuff and of the consequences of rotator cuff disorders is essential for optimal treatment planning and prognostic accuracy. Identifying the disorder, understanding the potential clinical consequences, and reporting all relevant findings at rotator cuff imaging are also essential."
CD009020,0,16831639,0,The association of suprascapular neuropathy with massive rotator cuff tears: a preliminary report.,"We studied a prospective, consecutive series of 8 patients presenting with massive rotator cuff tears (>5 cm. in maximum dimension), all associated with severe retraction and fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus muscle on magnetic resonance imaging studies. All 8 patients had suprascapular neuropathy shown by electromyography (EMG) findings of denervation in the supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus muscles. Clinically, all patients had severe limitation of active motion, with no patient able to elevate their affected arm actively >40 degrees . Four patients elected débridement and partial surgical repair using margin convergence principles via a mini-open approach. Follow-up of these patients averaged 24 months. All 4 patients regained the ability to elevate their affected arm to >90 degrees , and to place their hand actively behind their head without assistance. Two of the 4 surgical patients consented to follow-up EMG studies that demonstrated, in both cases, that the suprascapular nerve had significant renervation potentials, with almost complete recovery of the nerve in 1 case. We conclude that suprascapular neuropathy may be associated with massive rotator cuff tears, and that partial rotator cuff repair may allow recovery of the nerve and improvement of function."

Three clinical test results in particular--supraspinatus weakness, weakness of external rotation, and impingement--or 2 positive tests for a patient older than 60 years were highly predictive of rotator cuff tear (SOR: B, based on individual prospective study). Either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound can confirm a possible full-thickness tear (SOR: B, based on a systematic review of cohort studies). If a patient has an implantable device prohibiting MRI imaging, conventional arthrography is an alternative (SOR: A, individual randomized controlled trial).

The patient has already undergone a surgical procedure and is presenting now with pain possibly relating to a complication of the procedure or reinjury. In addition, the patient typically has undergone a series of maneuvers, from physical therapy to cortisone injection, without relief of the symptoms. For the orthopaedic surgeon the possibility of a complication of the procedure is disheartening. Finally, for the radiologist the postoperative shoulder usually is more difficult to interpret because of a change in the normal anatomy, not knowing exactly what was accomplished at surgery or what techniques or types of equipment were used, and, more typically, the presence of artifact."
CD009020,0,16798133,0,Shoulder magnetic resonance imaging.,"MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and allows for multiplanar imaging in anatomic planes. Because of these advantages MRI has become the study of choice for imaging of shoulder pathology. Some structures, such as the rotator cuff, humeral head contour, and glenoid shape, are evaluated well with conventional MRI. When more sensitive evaluation of the labrum, capsule, articular cartilage, and glenohumeral ligaments is required or when a partial-thickness rotator cuff tear is suspected,magnetic resonance arthrography with intra-articular contrast can be performed. For MR arthrography contrast is injected directly into the glenohumeral joint. This article reviews the appearances of normal anatomic structures in MRI of the shoulder and disorders involving the rotator cuff and glenoid labrum."
CD009020,0,16788406,0,Subacromial space measurement: a reliable method indicating fatty infiltration in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,"Proximal migration of the humeral head is thought to indicate fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles or rotator cuff tears. We sought to evaluate the influence of these rotator cuff abnormalities on the subacromial space. Using anteroposterior radiographs, ultrasound, and computed tomography, we analyzed 54 shoulders in 29 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The upward migration index was defined as proximal migration of the humeral head relative to its size. The mean muscle density from computed tomography images was used to indicate fatty infiltration. Fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus muscle showed the strongest correlation with proximal migration. After correcting for age, cuff tears, and rheumatoid disease, the partial correlation coefficient between both remained strong. A subdivision in proximal migration is proposed to screen for rotator cuff abnormalities. A large amount of fatty infiltration was indicated by an upward migration index less than 1.25, a medium amount by an upward migration index between 1.25 to 1.35, and a small amount by an upward migration index greater than 1.35. Measurement of proximal migration using the upward migration index provides a reliable screening method indicating fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff."

Two hundred seventeen consecutive shoulder MRI examinations performed over a 3-month period were prospectively reviewed and evaluated for isolated teres minor atrophy. Twelve (5.5%) patients had non-compressive isolated teres minor atrophy. Ninety-two percent (n=11) of these patients had rotator cuff or labroligamentous complex tears. No patients had an associated mass within the quadrilateral space. The average patient age was 60 years and 11 of the 12 patients were male. Isolated teres minor atrophy on MRI is most commonly seen in older patients who do not fit the expected clinical presentation of quadrilateral space syndrome. The anatomical relationship of the teres minor nerve to the joint capsule and the frequency of associated shoulder injuries in these patients raises the possibility of an association between humeral decentering and teres minor atrophy. Quadrilateral space syndrome would appear to be a very rare cause of isolated teres minor atrophy."

A systematic search for clinical trials or controlled studies was conducted with the following text words: should*, rotator cuff, impingement, work, sick leave, disabilit*, function*. Nineteen articles were included in this review. For functional limitations, there is strong evidence that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy is not effective, moderate evidence that exercise combined with manual therapy is more effective than exercise alone, that ultrasound is not effective, and that open and arthroscopic acromioplasty are equally effective on the long term. For all other interventions there is only limited evidence. We found many studies using range of motion and pain as outcome measures but functional limitations were less often used as an outcome measure in this type of research. Duration of sick leave was seldom included as an outcome measure."
CD009020,0,16703494,0,[Magnetic resonance imaging of glenohumeral instability].,"Conventional MR imaging and MR arthrography are established diagnostic imaging modalities for investigating shoulder instability. Since there are currently various surgical shoulder stabilization methods as well as conservative treatment strategies, the role of imaging is to provide diagnostic information to help determine the therapeutic approach. Whereas conventional MR imaging is usually sufficient for the evaluation of acute shoulder injuries due to the presence of a posttraumatic joint effusion, MR arthrography is the imaging modality of choice for chronic shoulder instability. Atraumatic and microtraumatic instability of the shoulder must be distinguished from traumatic instability since clinical findings and secondary or associated injuries differ from those of traumatic instability. Injuries of the IGHL-complex can be reliably diagnosed with MR arthrography. Traumatic anteroinferior luxation causes labroligamentous injuries at the glenoid insertion (Bankart-, Perthes-, ALPSA-, and non-classifiable chronic lesions) and injuries of the IGHL and its humeral insertion (HAGL-, BHAGL-, and floating AIGL-lesions). The type of injury and extent of degenerative changes or scarring that can be assessed with MR arthrography influence the therapeutic approach and in particular the decision between arthroscopic and open surgical methods of stabilization."

CD009020,0,16679227,0,Cuff integrity after arthroscopic versus open rotator cuff repair: a prospective study.,"Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) has been reported to have good clinical results but high retear rates by ultrasound. We prospectively assessed postoperative cuff integrity and outcome after arthroscopic RCR (40 patients) and compared these results with open RCR (32 patients). Evaluation preoperatively and at 1 year included a physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and Constant scores improved significantly in both groups (P < .0001). Overall, 69% of repairs in the open group and 53% in the arthroscopic group were intact by magnetic resonance imaging. Of tears less than 3 cm in size, 74% in the open group and 84% in the arthroscopic group were intact. Of tears greater than 3 cm in size, 62% in the open group and 24% in the arthroscopic group were intact (P < .036). In the arthroscopic group, patients with an intact cuff had significantly greater strength of elevation (P = .01) and external rotation (P = .02). We conclude that open and arthroscopic RCRs have similar clinical outcomes. Cuff integrity is comparable for small tears, but large tears have twice the retear rate after arthroscopic repair."

The pathologic change in the rotator cuff was graded from the magnetic resonance images by using the criteria described by Zlatkin and Iannotti. A modified grading system from Ozaki and Panni was used for pathologic grading of the anterior acromion. The functional score of Constant and Murley was used for clinical assessment. The pathologic change in the rotator cuff revealed by the magnetic resonance imaging study was more severe in patients with articular side tears compared with patients who had bursal side tears. On the contrary, the pathologic changes in the acromion were significantly milder in patients with articular side tears compared with bursal side tears. These observations indicate that articular side tears of the rotator cuff are mainly associated with intrinsic pathologic changes of the rotator cuff, whereas bursal side tears are associated with subacromial impingement on an underlying milder pathologic change of the rotator cuff."
CD009020,0,16677677,0,Does decalcification alter the tissue sound speed of rabbit supraspinatus tendon insertion? In vitro measurement using scanning acoustic microscopy.,"Failure of the tendon or ligament insertions is one of the most common injuries in the Orthopaedic field. To elucidate the pathogenesis of those injuries, the authors had attempted to measure the tissue sound speed that could be correlated to its elasticity using scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). For the application of SAM to tendon or ligament insertions, it was necessary to determine the role of decalcification in SAM measurements since mineralized tissues including bone or mineralized fibrocartilage were present at the insertion site. To assess whether decalcification alters the tissue sound speed or not, supraspinatus tendon insertion of six Japanese white rabbits were measured with SAM operating in the frequency range of 50-150 MHz. Right supraspinatus tendons attached to the humeral head were cut into two pieces at the center of the tendon. Then, they were fixed with 10% neutralized formalin for 12 h. In each specimen, medial half was not decalcified, while lateral half was decalcified with ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA). After embedding in paraffin, 5 microm thick specimens were prepared for the measurement using SAM. The mean sound speed in each histologic zone was evaluated, and subsequently compared to that measured in the undecalcified and the decalcified specimens. Mean sound speed of non-mineralized fibrocartilage was 1544 m/s in the undecalcified specimens, while the value of 1541 m/s was determined in the decalcified ones. On the other hand, it decreased 2-3% after decalcification in the mineralized tissue including mineralized fibrocartilage and bone (mineralized fibrocartilage: undecalcified = 1648 m/s, decalcified = 1604 m/s; bone: undecalcified = 1716 m/s, decalcified = 1677 m/s). However, no significant differences were found between the undecalcified and the decalcified specimens (non-mineralized fibrocartilage: p = 0.84, mineralized fibrocartilage: p = 0.35, bone: p = 0.28). These results indicate that SAM could be applied to determine the properties of the tendon or the ligament insertions after decalcification with EDTA. Although SAM is applicable only for in vitro experimental study, it is expected that these data will contribute to better understanding concerning the biomechanics of tendon or ligament insertions as well as the pathogenesis of their failure at a microscopic level."

In the case of external rotation of the humerus, better repositioning of the labrum ligament complex is achieved. Using MRI of the shoulder in external rotation, the extent of the improved labrum-ligament adjustment can be documented, and the indication of immobilization of the shoulder in external rotation can be derived.

A total of 78 surgically proven full-thickness rotator cuff tears in 74 patients were retrospectively included in the study. Clinical assessment was performed using the University of California at Los Angeles score. Postoperative MR imaging was evaluated to determine prevalence, size, and location of tendon rerupture. At a mean 48.4 months' follow-up, 62 shoulders (79.5%) had favorable outcomes and 45 shoulders (57.6%) showed rerupture on MR imaging studies. Reruptures were significantly more prevalent among patients with intermediate-to-bad outcomes (81.3%), with surgically demonstrated two-tendon tears (78.9%) or three-tendon tears (100%), and with preoperative fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus muscle greater than 1 (91.6%). Reruptures were also significantly larger in those subgroups. Complete repair of RCT of all sizes may have favorable outcomes in a significant proportion of patients in spite of a high prevalence of reruptures. Preoperative tear size and degree of muscle fatty degeneration influence the prevalence and rerupture size. After repair of supraspinatus tears, reruptures tend to invade the posterior aspect of the tendon."

Support vector machines (SVM) employ complex analysis techniques to solve classification and regression problems. A SVM, a machine learning technique, can be used for analysis and classification of shoulder strength data. The goals of this study were to determine the diagnostic competency of SVM based on shoulder strength data and to apply SVM analysis in efforts to derive a single representative shoulder strength score. Data were taken from fourteen isometric shoulder strength measurements of each shoulder (involved and uninvolved) in 45 rotator cuff tear patients. SVM diagnostic proficiency was found to be comparable to reported ultrasound values. Improvement of shoulder function was accurately represented by a single score in pairwise comparison of the pre-operative and the 12 month post-operative group (P < 0.004). Thus, the SVM-based score may be a promising metric for summarizing rotator cuff strength data."

CD009020,0,16464555,0,An overview of MR arthrography with emphasis on the current technique and applicational hints and tips.,"Magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography has been investigated in every major peripheral joint of the body, and has been proven to be effective in determining the integrity of intraarticular ligamentous and fibrocartilaginous structures and in the detection or assessment of osteochondral lesions and loose bodies in selected cases. Several methods could be used to create arthrogram effect during MR imaging, however, direct MR arthrography using diluted gadolinium as the contrast agent is the most commonly used technique and is the most reliable of all. MR arthrography is useful for demonstrating labrocapsular-ligamentous abnormalities and distinguishing partial thickness rotator cuff tears from focal full thickness tears in the shoulder, identifying or excluding recurrent tears following meniscal operations in the knee, demonstrating perforations of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and ligaments in the wrist, showing labral tears in the hip, diagnosing ligament tears in the ankle and identifying osteochondral lesions or loose bodies in any of the aforementioned joints. In this article, an overview of techniques of MR arthrography is provided with emphasis on direct MR arthrography using diluted gadolinium as the contrast agent. The current applications of the technique in major peripheral joints are reviewed, with emphasis given to the shoulder joint where the role of this technique has become well established."

MRI showed the subacromial fat to be completely obliterated and the infraspinatus tendon deformed due to compression by a mass localised at the acromion. The acromial lesion was curetted, and histopathologic analysis was consistent with the diagnosis of enchondroma. Tumours located in the coracoacromial arch have been very rarely reported as a cause of subacromial impingement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of subacromial impingement secondary to acromial enchondroma."
CD009020,0,16459855,0,Treatment of irreparable rotator cuff tears by latissimus dorsi muscle transfer.,"In this retrospective study, a latissimus dorsi transfer as first described by Gerber in 1988 was performed in 12 patients with massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears. Their average age was 59 years and the preliminary results are reported here after an average follow-up of 39 months. In 50% of the patients there was no pain and 41% had mild to moderate pain at follow-up. Functional Constant scoring was excellent in 42%, good in 8%, moderate in 42% and poor in 8%. Active range of motion in the shoulder improved significantly in external rotation and abduction. Abduction force as measured with Atlantech and Cybex systems showed weak results. In two patients these tests could not be performed due to lack of force, in 9 patients abduction force was much weaker than on the contralateral side and in one patient the operated arm was stronger than the other side. We conclude that in most patients good pain relief and functional improvement can be achieved after latissimus dorsi transfer for irreparable rotator cuff tear. A good active range of motion can be expected but a lack of force persists. However, it remains difficult to conclude for which patients this surgery can be predictably successful."
CD009020,0,16456661,0,Glenohumeral interposition of a torn rotator cuff in a young motorcyclist.,This report describes the rare case of a traumatic rotator cuff tear in a young patient which led to a pseudo-paralyzed shoulder by interposition of the tendon stump into the glenohumeral joint.

CD009020,0,16453345,0,Effect of experimental suprascapular nerve block on active glenohumeral translations in vivo.,"Static superior shoulder instability is associated with long-standing rotator cuff tears. Factors or mechanisms which can prevent superior migration of the humeral head, and therefore allow preservation or restoration of shoulder function despite nonanatomical cuff repair, are poorly understood. The question has therefore arisen, whether centering of the humeral head was the result of active shoulder muscle function. It was the goal of this experimental investigation to (1) determine the pattern of glenohumeral translations during active shoulder abduction measured by open-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, and to (2) determine the influence of experimental paralysis of the infra- and supraspinatus muscles on these translations. In contrast to prior experimental investigations, the humeral head remained always centered in the glenoid fossa during active abduction. No superior migration of the humeral head could be provoked with experimental paralysis of the supra- and/or infraspinatus muscles. The hypothesis that static or dynamic superior humeral head displacement is prevented by active-supra- and/or infraspinatus muscle function must therefore be rejected, for the shoulder with a structurally intact muscle-tendon-bone unit."

Long-term monitoring of the results obtained in 20 patients treated at our clinic using this method are reported, comparing the data obtained in evaluations of results with preoperative values. Clinical evaluations were obtained using the Constant Score System, while X-ray examination showed the presence of osteoarticular modifications, and MRI and electromyography the preserved morphology and function of transplant. The mean Constant Score increased from 31.6 points preoperatively to 66.1 points postoperatively at the time of follow-up. At follow-up, MRI allowed us to evaluate any fatty degeneration of the muscle fibers of transfer and the integrity of tendinous insertion on the humeral greater tuberosity.

CD009020,0,16422234,0,Clinical and ultrasound results after arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff.,"The literature reports good functional results obtained with arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff, but the incidence of anatomical healing has not been sufficiently studied. Ultrasound examination makes it possible to accurately document the healing process of the tendon at the bone, gathering information that may be useful in a comparison with clinical data. A total of 43 consecutive arthroscopic repairs of rotator cuff injuries were considered, that had made use of anchors and non-resorbable suturing. A total of 42 patients were willing to undergo clinical monitoring with an associated ultrasound examination after 3, 6 and 12 months. When ultrasound examination after 6 and 12 months was carried out, 36 patients presented with anatomical healing of the rotator cuff. The total percentage of repair failures was 14.3% and increased to 23% if we take into consideration the subscapular tendon alone. Constant score went from a preoperative mean of 51.25 to a mean of 78.21 after 12 months (p<0.001). Arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff leads to anatomical healing of the tendons in a high percentage of cases, obtaining good functional results. The absence of healing is associated with lower values for recovery of strength at clinical follow-up. The advanced age of the patients (p<0.001) and the extensive injuries that involve several tendons (p=0.002) are negative prognostic factors."

CD009020,0,16414467,0,In vivo anatomy of the Neer and Hawkins sign positions for shoulder impingement.,"The Neer and Hawkins impingement signs are commonly used to diagnose subacromial pathology, but the anatomy of these maneuvers has not been well elucidated in vivo. This 3-dimensional open magnetic resonance imaging study characterized shoulder anatomy and rotator cuff impingement in 8 normal volunteers placed in the Neer and Hawkins positions. Subacromial and intraarticular contact of the rotator cuff was graded, and minimum distances were computed between the tendon insertion sites and the glenoid, acromion, and coracoid. Both the Neer and Hawkins maneuvers significantly decreased the distance from the supraspinatus insertion to the acromion and posterior glenoid and from the subscapularis insertion to the anterior glenoid. However, the Hawkins position resulted in significantly greater subacromial space narrowing and subacromial rotator cuff contact than the Neer position. In the Hawkins position, subacromial contact of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus was observed in 7 of 8 and 5 of 8 subjects, respectively. In contrast, rotator cuff contact with the acromion did not occur in any subject in the Neer position. Intraarticular contact of the supraspinatus with the posterosuperior glenoid was observed in all subjects in both positions. Subscapularis contact with the anterior glenoid was also seen in 7 of 8 subjects in the Neer position and in all subjects in the Hawkins position. This extensive intraarticular contact suggests that internal impingement may play a role in the Neer and Hawkins signs."

US technique for shoulder examination depends on patient positioning, scanning protocol for every tendon and anatomic part, and dynamic imaging. The primary US signs for rotator cuff supraspinatus tendon tears are tendon nonvisualization for complete tears, focal tendon defect for full-thickness tears, a hypoechoic defect of the articular side of the tendon for an articular-side partial-thickness tear, and flattening of the bursal surface of the tendon for a bursal-side partial-thickness tear. Secondary US signs such as cortical irregularity of the greater tuberosity and joint and subacromial-subdeltoid bursal fluid are helpful when correlated with the primary signs. Tendon degeneration, tendinosis, and intrasubstance tear are demonstrated as internal heterogeneity. Long-head biceps tendon abnormalities include instability, acute or chronic tear, and tendinosis. The acromioclavicular joint is assessed for dislocation, fluid collection, cysts, and bone erosions. Other non-rotator cuff disorders include synovial disorders such as adhesive capsulitis and synovial osteochondromatosis; degenerative disorders such as osteoarthritis, amyloid arthropathy, hemarthrosis, and chondrocalcinosis; infectious disorders such as septic arthritis and bursitis; and space-occupying lesions."

Seventy-three patients who had a cuff tear limited only to the supraspinatus tendon were included in this study. The University of California, Los Angeles score improved significantly after surgery. MRI was carried out before surgery and 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively in all patients. Muscle volume of the supraspinatus was assessed on images of the oblique coronal plane, and that of the infraspinatus was assessed on images of the axial plane. The width of the supraspinatus muscle did not recover until 6 months postoperatively. Direct measurement of the infraspinatus muscle volume by use of MRI can be a good indicator when evaluating whether the repaired rotator cuffs are actually functioning."

More recent studies reveal that the outcome is not uniformly good, but the cause of poor outcomes has not been investigated. Our study identified 9 patients who had sustained a glenoid neck fracture of the scapula within the last 10 years and who were treated conservatively with immobilization and then early active motion. Their functional and anatomic outcomes were analyzed by clinical examination and validated scoring systems, including the Oxford questionnaire and Constant score. Plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging were correlated to outcome. None of the 9 patients were pain-free, and some had poor Oxford and Constant scores.

CD009020,0,16315115,0,Imaging of the overhead throwing athlete.,"Knowledge of overhead throwing biomechanics is crucial to understand specific injuries encountered in throwing athletes on diagnostic imaging. Most specific injuries of overhead throwing athletes occur at the shoulder and elbow. Throwing athletes are susceptible to rotator cuff tears from tensile overload and external and internal impingement. The labrum is also commonly degenerated or torn secondary to overuse syndrome, internal impingement, and microtrauma. The elbow is typically injured secondary to excessive valgus forces during throwing. The ulnar collateral ligament, ulnar nerve, and common flexor tendon origin are all at increased risk of injury. Capitellar osteochondral injuries and loose intra-articular bodies are also frequent. Knowledge of injury pathophysiology is crucial to understanding the treatment rationale in throwing athletes."
CD009020,0,16307290,0,A study for evaluating the effect of the deltoid-flap repair in massive rotator cuff defects.,"The repair of massive cuff defects by direct suture often is impossible. In these cases, a repair by musculo-tendineous flaps (latissimus-dorsi, pectoralis or deltoideus) is required. It was the goal of this study to evaluate the result of delta-flap repair in case of massive cuff defects with a diameter of 5 cm or more. Between 1998 and 2000 for all patients who were suffering from a massive rotator cuff tear more than 5 cm a deltoid transfer was performed. A total of 20 patients (14 male, 6 female; age: 60.9+/-8.7 years) were available for a follow-up after 47.2+/-8.0 (range, 36 to 60) month. The operation included an arthroscopic evaluation, acromioplasty with resection of the lateral clavicular end, and biceps tenodesis. The cuff defect was repaired by transfer a muscular flap from the anterior part of the deltoid (about 2 x 6 cm) into the defect. The patients subjectively rated their result-10 excellent, 9 good, and 1 poor. Preoperatively, the Constant amounted 26.3+/-5.1 points. At follow-up, the score significantly increased to 74.5+/-8.5 points. The acromiohumeral distance increased from 4.9+/-1.1 to 9.2+/-1.7 mm. In MRI examination of 11 patients all had an intact flap. Two complications (a wound hematoma and a deep infection) did not influence the result.

CD009020,0,16284137,0,"Rotator cuff tears: clinical, radiographic, and US findings.","Rotator cuff tears are a common cause of shoulder pain. Clinical and radiographic findings can suggest the presence of a rotator cuff tear. The most sensitive clinical findings are impingement and the ""arc of pain"" sign. Radiographic findings are usually normal in the acute setting, although the ""active abduction"" view may show decreased acromiohumeral distance. In more chronic cases, an outlet view may show decreased opacity and decreased size of the supraspinatus muscle due to atrophy. In late cases, the humeral head may become subluxated superiorly, and secondary degenerative arthritis of the glenohumeral joint may ensue. Ultrasonography (US), with over 90% sensitivity and specificity, can help confirm the diagnosis in clinically or radiographically equivocal cases. US can also reveal the presence of other abnormalities that may mimic rotator cuff tear at clinical examination, including tendinosis, calcific tendinitis, subacromial subdeltoid bursitis, greater tuberosity fracture, and adhesive capsulitis."
CD009020,0,16279387,0,Supraspinatus tendinosis associated with biceps brachii tendon displacement in a dog.,"A 4-year-old spayed female Australian Cattle Dog (Blue Heeler) was evaluated because of right forelimb lameness of 5 months' duration. Orthopedic evaluation revealed signs of pain localized to the cranial aspects of both shoulder joints. Via magnetic resonance imaging, the mass of the supraspinatus tendon insertion in both shoulder joints was increased, compared with findings in cadavers of clinically normal dogs; additional imaging procedures revealed that, compared with clinically normal tendons, the tendon had increased signal intensity that was consistent with increased fluid content. The increased supraspinatus tendon mass in each shoulder joint was associated with medial displacement of the biceps brachii tendon, which was more severe in the right limb. Arthroscopic evaluations of both shoulder joints revealed no abnormalities. The dog underwent surgery, and the abnormal parts of the tendons were resected. The most prominent finding on histologic examination of excised tissues was severe myxomatous degeneration. The lameness resolved, and at 22 months after surgery, the dog was reported to have had no recurrence of lameness. The clinical signs and histologic appearance of the tendons in this dog strongly resemble findings associated with tendinosis in humans. Decompression of the biceps brachii tendon may have contributed to the successful outcome after surgery in this dog. Supraspinatus tendinosis should be considered among the differential diagnoses in dogs with uni- or bilateral forelimb lameness."

Magnetic resonance arthrography allows observation of these features and other intraarticular structures. To assess the utility of magnetic resonance imaging in assessing size and morphologic features, we retrospectively reviewed observations on 41 shoulders in 37 consecutive surgically treated patients (mean age, 63.2 years) who had magnetic resonance imaging followed by magnetic resonance arthrography. The maximum rotator cuff defect size in the anteroposterior direction defined transverse size, and the maximum rotator cuff defect size in the mediolateral direction defined longitudinal size. Sensitivities for detecting full-thickness rotator cuff tears by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance arthrography were 90.2% and 100%, respectively. Maximum longitudinal and transverse dimensions of the tear as shown by magnetic resonance arthrography correlated better with intraoperative measurements (r2 = 0.85 transversely, 0.92 longitudinally) than magnetic resonance imaging measurements (r2 = 0.47 transversely, 0.26 longitudinally). The reproducibility of the two methods is similar. Magnetic resonance arthrography also allowed morphologic classification of the torn tendon as blunt end, tapering end, indistinct end, horizontal tear, and global tear. There was good agreement in classifying torn edges; the imaging findings agreed with findings at surgery. Magnetic resonance arthrography was more accurate in evaluating rotator cuff tear size and morphologic features than conventional magnetic resonance imaging."
CD009020,0,16200386,0,Posterior-inferior glenoid rim shapes by MR imaging.,"Our purpose was to try to apply a CT classification of glenoid rim shapes to MR images and to determine the reliability of the subsequent MR classification by testing observer variability. Shoulder MR imaging exams of 54 consecutive patients were reviewed retrospectively by two musculoskeletal radiologists independently. Posterior-inferior glenoid rim shape was categorized, based on reported CT criteria, as triangle, ""lazy-J"" or ""delta"" using the most caudal MR section that unequivocally showed articular cartilage. The same studies were reviewed again one month later to test interobserver and intraobserver variability. Final determination of glenoid rim type was made by consensus. There were 31 males and 23 females with an average age of 42 years, range 14-75 years. Forty-one patients were referred for evaluation of nonspecific shoulder pain, 9 for suspected rotator cuff tear and 4 for instability. The most common shape was ""lazy-J"" with 32 patients (59%) having this type. The least common was delta shape, with 7 patients (13%) having this form. Fifteen patients (28%) had a normal triangle shape. There was significant interobserver variability in determining the shape of the glenoid rim with 17/54 (31%) discordant readings. For the ""lazy-J"" shape, the kappa value was .02, for the ""delta"" type, kappa value was .60 and for the triangle shape, kappa was .32. Intraobserver variability was 35% for radiologist A and 28% for radiologist B. Kappa values for intraobserver variability ranged from .53 to .85. Four patients had posterior instability, 3 were judged to have normal triangular inferior glenoid rims and 1 a ""lazy J"" type by Radiologist A. Radiologist B judged 2 of the instability patients as normal triangular and 2 as ""lazy J"". A CT classification of posterior-inferior glenoid rim shapes can be applied using MR imaging, however, there is significant observer variability that limits the applicability of this classification scheme with MR imaging."

CD009020,0,16156339,0,Common overuse tendon problems: A review and recommendations for treatment.,"There is a common misconception that symptomatic tendon injuries are inflammatory; because of this, these injuries often are mislabeled as ""tendonitis.""' Acute inflammatory tendinopathies exist, but most patients seen in primary care will have chronic symptoms suggesting a degenerative condition that should be labeled as ""tendinosus"" or ""tendinopathy."" Accurate diagnosis requires physicians to recognize the historical features, anatomy, and useful physical examination maneuvers for these common tendon problems. The natural history is gradually increasing load-related localized pain coinciding with increased activity. The most common overuse tendinopathies involve the rotator cuff, medial and lateral elbow epicondyles, patellar tendon, and Achilles tendon. Examination should include thorough inspection to assess for swelling, asymmetry, and erythema of involved tendons; range-of-motion testing; palpation for tenderness; and examination maneuvers that simulate tendon loading and reproduce pain. Plain radiography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful if the diagnosis remains unclear. Most patients with overuse tendinopathies (about 80 percent) fully recover within three to six months, and outpatient treatment should consist of relative rest of the affected area, icing, and eccentric strengthening exercises. Although topical and systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for acute pain relief, these cannot be recommended in favor of other analgesics. Injected corticosteroids also can relieve pain, but these drugs should be used with caution. Ultrasonography, shock wave therapy, orthotics, massage, and technique modification are treatment options, but few data exist to support their use at this time. Surgery is an effective treatment that should be reserved for patients who have failed conservative therapy."
CD009020,0,16148361,0,Subscapularis tendon tears.,"Pathology of the subscapularis tendon is both infrequently identified and not commonly considered as a major source of shoulder pain and dysfunction. Subscapularis tendon pathology can present as isolated tears; partial-thickness tears; anterosuperior tears, also involving the supraspinatus tendon; complete rotator cuff avulsion; and rotator interval lesions, in which instability of the long head of the biceps tendon may dominate the clinical presentation. Although an accurate physical examination is paramount, modalities such as arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound have advanced knowledge of the spectrum of abnormalities involving the subscapularis tendon. Nonsurgical management may be effective for most partial tears. Surgically, open repair is more frequent than use of arthroscopic techniques. Tears of the subscapularis tendon portend a different prognosis than do supraspinatus tendon tears, especially when the injury is acute and diagnosis is delayed."

However, despite the limitations in the existing literature, there has emerged a consensus among shoulder experts that partial-thickness rotator cuff tears should be aggressively treated in the active athlete because of the unfavorable natural history of these lesions and success of accepted surgical algorithms. This review will provide an overview of the theories regarding the origins of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, discuss the relative accuracy of accepted diagnostic techniques, and summarize the indications and methods of operative repair with an emphasis on the results of various treatment approaches."

Forty-three human shoulder specimens (age range and mean age at death, 61-89 years and 78.3 years) were examined with the use of MR arthrography and multi-slice CT arthrography prior to joint exploration and macroscopic inspection of the superior labrum and labro-bicipital complex. Two radiologists evaluated MR and CT arthrograms, and the results were compared with macroscopic assessments. Anatomical dissection of all shoulder specimens revealed a sublabral recess in 32/43 (74%) cases. The attachment of the superior labrum was categorised as type 1 in ten (23%) cases, as type 2 in eight (19%), as type 3 in ten (23%), and as type 4 in 14 (33%) cases. One superior labrum showed detachment consistent with a superior labral anteroposterior (SLAP) type 3 lesion. On MR arthrography and CT arthrography the attachment of the superior labrum was categorised in concordance with macroscopic assessments in 79% and 84% of cases, respectively. The anteroposterior extension of sublabral recesses was accurately determined with MR and CT arthrography in 59% and 81% of cases, respectively. The attachment of the superior labrum shows considerable variability. Thus, exact depiction of variants is essential in order to avoid the false positive diagnosis of a superior labral tear (SLAP or Andrews lesion). Both, MR arthrography and multi-slice CT arthrography were effective in the detection and classification of sublabral recesses."

This study deals with the presentation and management of four unusual cases of suprascapular nerve entrapment in volleyball players. Four male volleyball players presented to our department with intractable shoulder pain and subjective sensation of shoulder weakness. They all had visible wasting of both supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, together with weakness of abduction and external rotation of the arm. They all responded temporarily to a diagnostic injection of local anaesthetic. MR imaging was useful in diagnosing space occupying lesions in three cases and the presence of a hypertrophic suprascapular ligament in one case. Due to failure of non- operative treatment, which included activity modification, rest, analgesics and rehabilitation programme over 6 months, surgery was then required to decompress the suprascapular nerve. All patients were symptom free at 6 months postoperatively and after an intensive rehabilitation programme, they were able to return to their normal level of activity including sport."

Twenty-seven patients with unilateral full-thickness rotator cuff tears diagnosed by either positive arthrogram or magnetic resonance imaging were included in this study. Three groups were formed based on intraoperative findings: 10 patients had isolated supraspinatus tendon tears (group 1), 11 patients had supraspinatus and infraspinatus tears (group 2), and 6 patients had supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendon tears (group 3). There was no statistically significant difference between the degree of humeral head excursion in groups 1 and 2. However, patients in group 3 had a statistically significantly higher degree of excursion of the humeral head (P < .05) when compared with groups 1 and 2. In addition, an inverse relationship between the degree of humeral head excursion and preoperative Constant scores was found. Superior excursion of the humeral head on the glenoid had a significantly higher incidence in patients with subscapularis tears, and a larger amount of excursion was present in patients who had lower preoperative Constant scores."

CD009020,0,15983127,0,A systematic approach to magnetic resonance imaging interpretation of sports medicine injuries of the shoulder.,"Magnetic resonance imaging has developed as a useful imaging modality in the evaluation of the athlete with shoulder pain. The multiplanar capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging make it ideal for detecting the anatomical variations of the osseous outlet that may contribute to the clinical syndrome of impingement. Its superb soft tissue contrast and spatial resolution allow for accurate differentiation between tendinopathy, partial-thickness tear, and full-thickness tear of the rotator cuff and also allow for detection of the subtle lesions of the capsule and labrum that are associated with shoulder instability. However, to accurately interpret the numerous images and pulse sequences obtained in a standard magnetic resonance examination of the shoulder, it is helpful to have a systematic approach to ensure that each of the pertinent anatomical structures are evaluated. This article will provide a systematic approach to the interpretation of a magnetic resonance examination of the shoulder. The normal imaging appearance of each anatomical structure will be described, and the most useful pulse sequences and imaging planes for the evaluation of each structure will be discussed.

A total of 24 patients with RA, 18 with AS, and 20 healthy controls matched by age and body mass index (BMI) were included in the study. All of the patients and controls underwent clinical and ultrasonographic examinations of both lower limbs at five enthesal sites (superior and inferior pole of the patella, tibial tuberosity, Achilles tendon, and plantar aponeurosis) and both upper limbs at two tendon sites (tendons of m. biceps brachii and supraspinatus at the shoulder). High-resolution ultrasonographic examinations were performed to detect bursitis, structure thickness, bony erosion, and enthesophyte. An ultrasonographic score of lower limb enthesitis was calculated using the Glasgow Ultrasound Enthesitis Scoring System (GUESS) in all patients. Tendon involvements and enthesal abnormalities were found significantly more often in the RA group than in controls (p<0.05 to <0.001), but were not found to be different from the AS group (p>0.05). On clinical examination 67 of 336 (19.9%) tendon and enthesal sites were abnormal and on ultrasonographic examination 130 of 336 (38.2%) sites were abnormal in RA patients. The most frequently affected enthesal sites in the lower limbs were suprapatellar, infrapatellar, and Achilles tendon in both the RA and AS groups. The tibial tuberosity was less affected in both groups, and involvement of the plantar aponeurosis was not different from the controls. A statistically significant correlation was found between the Ritchie articular index and GUESS (r=0.578, p=0.008). Tendon involvements and enthesal abnormalities in RA patients were found more often than had been estimated. Further studies are required to validate our results."

This may be due to the increasing popularity of free time sport, but also to the increasing number of treatment possibilities. The origin of damage to the tendons can be explained by a series of mechanisms, of which reduced tissue perfusion and mechanical irritation with microtrauma, which lead to degeneration, can be considered as the most important. Imaging diagnostics plays a significant role in the diagnosis and planning of the therapy of such illnesses. In addition to the conventional x-ray to determine the position of the joint and bony structures, ultrasound can be used to examine the tendons, bursae and tissue.MRI is an excellent method for examining the pathology of tendons due to its exceptional qualities for imaging tissue and joints as well as its high specificity. Using MRI, it is possible to determine the degree of morphological change, make reproducible examinations, as well as determining comorbidity factors or the reasons for the changes early in the illness. It therefore influences surgical decisions and can play a key role in the planning of operations.

Prevalence and type of structural abnormalities, especially abnormalities of the rotator cuff tendons and the superolateral humeral head, and correlation of magnetic resonance imaging findings with symptoms and clinical tests, are not well known. Throwing and nonthrowing (symptomatic and asymptomatic) shoulders of 30 fully competitive professional handball players and 20 dominant shoulders of randomly selected volunteers were evaluated for comparison clinically and with magnetic resonance imaging. An average of seven abnormal magnetic resonance imaging findings was observed in the throwing shoulders; more than in the nonthrowing and the control shoulders. Although 93% of the throwing shoulders had abnormal magnetic resonance imaging findings, only 37% were symptomatic. Partial rotator cuff tears and mainly superolateral osteochondral defects of the humeral head were identified as typical throwing lesions. Symptoms correlated poorly with abnormalities seen on magnetic resonance imaging scans and findings from clinical tests. This suggests that the evaluation of an athlete's throwing shoulder should be done very thoroughly and should not be based mainly on abnormalities seen on magnetic resonance imaging scans."

We studied 206 shoulders with rotator cuff tears that had surgical treatment. The acromiohumeral interval (anteroposterior radiograph) and the coracohumeral interval (computed tomogram) were measured on preoperative imaging studies. An abnormal acromiohumeral interval was associated with multiple-tendon rotator cuff tears involving the infraspinatus, fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus or infraspinatus, and duration of symptoms longer than 5 years. An abnormal coracohumeral interval was associated with a combined tear of the supraspinatus and subscapularis and fatty degeneration of the infraspinatus or subscapularis. Fatty degeneration of the infraspinatus therefore was associated with an abnormal acromiohumeral interval and an abnormal coracohumeral interval. Evaluation of a patient who has a diminished acromiohumeral or coracohumeral interval should involve examination with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the rotator cuff tendons to determine the type of tear and of the rotator cuff muscles to determine the degree of fatty degeneration."
CD009020,0,15805937,0,Medicolegal aspects of the orthopaedic care for shoulder injuries.,"The medicolegal aspects of orthopaedic care increasingly are becoming an important focus of physicians. Because of the rarity of publications on the subject, I will examine medical litigation in orthopaedics, specifically in regards to shoulder injuries. There are several reasons for recent increases in malpractice litigation. Increased orthopaedic specialization and advanced technologies have raised patient expectations while the media have informed patients of the potential financial rewards of litigation. I will discuss three cases of litigation regarding shoulder injuries including reasons for malpractice and what can be done to avoid it. In Case 1 I examine an implant failure of a rotator cuff repair. The failure was caused by a manufacturing error; therefore, the importance of being familiar with the equipment and the companies that a physician deals with is emphasized in this case. Case 2 is another failed rotator cuff repair; this litigation stemmed from poor patient selection and a lack of preoperative patient-physician communication. Finally, Case 3 involved retained hardware, a surgical mistake that often results in a substantial settlement because it is considered indefensible. These cases highlight the potential for malpractice and can be applied more broadly to all branches of orthopaedics. Most litigation, however, can be avoided with careful diagnostic procedures, greater experience with equipment, and better communication."

In cases of displaced isolated fractures of the lesser tuberosity without significant subluxation or dislocation of the long head of the biceps arthroscopic reconstruction using suture anchors can lead to a good clinical and radiological result."

CD009020,0,15789018,0,Acute subscapularis tendon rupture caused by throwing: a case report.,Abstract not available
CD009020,0,15789010,0,Differential patterns of muscle activation in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic rotator cuff tears.,"Patients with rotator cuff tears have varying degrees of symptom expression. Our purpose was to evaluate the differential firing patterns of the rotator cuff, deltoid, and scapular stabilizer muscle groups in normal control subjects and in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic 2-tendon rotator cuff tears. Eighteen subjects were evaluated: six normal subjects and twelve with 2-tendon cuff tears (six asymptomatic and six symptomatic). All cuff tear patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans documenting superoposterior tear configurations involving the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons; all normal subjects had an ultrasound examination confirming the absence of cuff pathology. Subjects were grouped based on shoulder examination and outcomes questionnaires. Asymptomatic patients had minimal pain (<3 on the visual analog scale and no loss of active range of motion compared with the contralateral side); symptomatic patients had pain greater than 3 on the visual analog scale and decreased range of motion compared with the contralateral side (>10 degrees of motion loss). Electromyographic activity from 12 muscles and kinematic data were collected simultaneously during 10 functional tasks. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic cuff subjects demonstrated a trend toward increased muscle activation during all tasks compared with normal subjects. During the internal rotation tasks, asymptomatic patients had significantly greater (P<.05) subscapularis activity than symptomatic patients (65% maximal voluntary contraction [MVC] vs 42% MVC). During the carrying task, asymptomatic patients demonstrated significantly less (P<.03) upper trapezius muscle activation than symptomatic patients (16% MVC vs 50% MVC). During shoulder elevation tasks, symptomatic patients had significantly greater supraspinatus (52% MVC vs 28% MVC, P<.03), infraspinatus (32% MVC vs 16% MVC, P<.05), and upper trapezius (39% MVC vs 20% MVC, P<.04) muscle activation compared with asymptomatic patients. During heavy elevation (8 lb), asymptomatic patients showed a trend toward increased activation (P<.06) of the subscapularis compared with symptomatic patients (34% MVC vs 21% MVC). Differential shoulder muscle firing patterns in patients with rotator cuff pathology may play a role in the presence or absence of symptoms. Asymptomatic subjects demonstrated increased firing of the intact subscapularis, whereas symptomatic subjects continued to rely on torn rotator cuff tendons and periscapular muscle substitution, resulting in compromised function."
CD009020,0,15789006,0,Biceps tenodesis associated with arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears.,"Associated lesions of the biceps tendon are commonly found during arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears. These lesions are treated with tenodesis, classically performed through an open approach. However, it seems reasonable to seek a single approach to correct both lesions; therefore, we have proposed a new arthroscopic technique that allows an exclusive arthroscopic tenodesis by including the biceps tendon in the rotator cuff suture, a surgical technique with a single suture of the rotator cuff that includes the biceps tendon. We treated 97 shoulders in 96 patients arthroscopically for complete rotator cuff tears. Of these shoulders, 15 required tenodesis for treatment of biceps tendon lesions. Through an arthroscopic approach, a subacromial decompression followed by a rotator cuff repair was carried out in association with a biceps tenodesis. In this technique, one limb of the suture was passed through the biceps tendon, and the other was passed through the rotator cuff tear, bringing both tissues together in the final suture. Of the patients, 9 were men and 5 were women. Their mean age was 71 years (range, 41-80 years). The dominant arm was affected in all patients. Postoperative evaluation, by use of the UCLA score, after a mean follow-up period of 32.4 months showed satisfactory results in 93.4% of patients: 11 had excellent results, 3 had good results, and only 1 had an unsatisfactory result. In this case a postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an intact rotator cuff and biceps tenodesis. The suture involving the rotator cuff and the biceps tendon proved effective to correct both lesions, with the main advantage being that an additional approach was not required."

CD009020,0,15773644,0,Comparison of total and partial traumatic tears of the subscapularis tendon.,We treated surgically 16 shoulders with an isolated traumatic rupture of the subscapularis tendon over a six-year period. Nine patients had a total and seven a partial tear of the subscapularis tendon. Repair was undertaken through a small deltopectoral groove approach. The mean Constant score improved in total tears from 38.7 to 89.3 points (p = 0.003) and in partial tears from 50.7 to 87.9 points (p = 0.008). The total tears were significantly more improved by surgery than the partial tears (p = 0.001). The delay between trauma and surgery was inversely proportional to the improvement in the Constant score suggesting that early diagnosis and surgical repair improves outcome.

Partial articular-side supraspinatus tendon avulsions (PASTA) form a subgroup deserving special consideration. We present a transtendon suture technique that is able to preserve the intact tendon fibers and to achieve firm attachment of the tendon to the humeral footprint using 1 double-loaded bone anchor. The surgical technique is described in detail, and pitfalls and complications are noted. The clinical results of the first 22 consecutive patients are reported, showing an increase in the UCLA score from 17.1 to 31.2 points and a patient satisfaction rate of 91%."
CD009020,0,15734234,0,Asymmetric atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle following tendon tear.,"Muscle atrophy is a known consequence of muscle disuse, muscle denervation and tendon tear. Whereas after nerve injury muscle atrophies in the denervated area, the distribution of muscle atrophy following tear of its tendon is not known. Standardized MRI scans of 64 consecutive, painful shoulders were evaluated for supraspinatus tendon tearing, myotendinous retraction, supraspinatus muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration, ratio of the scapular (deep) and fascial (superficial) muscle area (""symmetry"") and position of the central tendon within the supraspinatus fossa. There were thirteen shoulders with no and eleven shoulders with partial thickness supraspinatus tendon tears. In the forty cases with full thickness tendon tear, there was significant muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration. Atrophy of the fascial muscle portion was 43%, on the bony side it was 9% (p<0.005). The position of the central tendon within the supraspinatus fossa, was unaltered. Muscular changes following tendon tear occur highly asymmetrically: the muscle portion originating from the fascia primarily atrophies, the portion originating from the scapula primarily undergoes fatty infiltration. Muscular changes are not simply a consequence of muscle disuse, but dependent on architectural changes in the muscle."

CD009020,0,15723008,0,Quantitative assessment of thinning of the subscapularis tendon in recurrent anterior dislocation of the shoulder by use of magnetic resonance imaging.,"It is known that thinning and lengthening of the subscapularis tendon occur in shoulders with recurrent anterior dislocation. However, no studies have been performed to quantify the morphologic changes of the subscapularis tendon under such conditions. We retrospectively measured the thickness and cross-sectional area of the subscapularis tendon by use of magnetic resonance imaging in 22 shoulders in 11 patients with unilateral recurrent anterior dislocation of the shoulder. The contralateral shoulder in each patient served as a control. The thickness and cross-sectional area of the subscapularis on the affected side were smaller than those on the normal side (6.5 +/- 1.7 mm vs 8.0 +/- 1.9 mm, P = .001, and 388.6 +/- 120.0 mm 2 vs 547.9 +/- 128.5 mm 2 , P = .0001, respectively). We conclude that the subscapularis tendon undergoes an 18.7% decrease in thickness and a 29.1% decrease in cross-sectional area in shoulders with recurrent anterior dislocation."
CD009020,0,15693538,0,Severe lymphedema of the arm as a potential cause of shoulder trauma.,"The aim of this study was to determine whether lymphedema of the arm is associated with traumatic injury to the shoulder and to assess the role of lymphatic physiotherapy in reducing disabling shoulder pain. The study group consisted of 10 women aged 58-81 years (mean 66.9) with arm lymphedema after surgery for breast cancer. The average interval between the operation and the appearance of lymphedema was 9.8 years. All patients complained of shoulder pain. Five patients had a tear in the supraspinatus muscle diagnosed by ultrasound examination, and 5 had chronic bursitis; the nonaffected arm showed no pathology. The mean volume of the affected arm was 568 ml greater. Treatment consisted of manual lymphatic drainage and intermittent sessions of pneumatic compression with the LymphaPress device. This led to an average decrease in arm volume of 170 ml, with improvement of arm mobility and a drastic reduction in shoulder pain. In conclusion, lymphedema of the arm can cause severe shoulder trauma, pain and disability. Proper physiotherapy can reduce these effects. Patients should be referred for early treatment and follow-up to avoid permanent damage to the shoulder muscles."

CD009020,0,15685073,0,The causes of pain in benign solitary enchondromas of the proximal humerus.,"Patients with benign solitary enchondromas of the proximal humerus frequently present to the diagnosing physician with shoulder pain. Once the lesion is considered benign, emphasis can be placed on identifying the etiology for the pain. We reviewed our experience with these patients to identify the cause of the presenting pain. A retrospective review of clinical records and radiographic studies (radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and bone scans) was done for all patients presenting to an orthopaedic oncology unit with solitary enchondroma of the proximal humerus. Attention was focused on diagnostic evidence of additional disease in the shoulder. Fifty-seven patients (mean age, 53.6 years) met the criteria of the study and were included for evaluation. Of patients presenting with pain, 82% (47 of 57 patients) had findings seen on magnetic resonance imaging scans that correlated with the initial clinical diagnostic impression, suggesting that other disease was present that could explain the pain. Solitary enchondromas of the proximal humerus often are found incidentally during the initial evaluation of patients with shoulder pain. This study showed that additional treatable disease usually is present in patients with enchondromas of the proximal humerus."
CD009020,0,15679569,0,Sonographic evaluations in elite college baseball athletes.,"This study compared the thickness of the biceps and supraspinatus tendons, the widths of the subacromial space in the frontal and scapular planes, and abnormal sonographic findings in the shoulders of injured, and uninjured elite college baseball athletes and healthy controls. This study recruited two groups of 42 and 12 athletes, with and without histories of shoulder injuries, respectively, as well as one control group of 16 college students who were matched for physical characteristics but not involved in sports. The results showed that the thickness of the biceps and supraspinatus tendons and the subacromial space widths at 0 degrees and 90 degrees shoulder abduction in the frontal plane were significantly greater in the athletes than in the controls (P-values <0.004). The occurrences of the acromioclavicular joint bulging, bicep tendon degeneration, infraspinatus tendon degeneration and infraspinatus cortical irregularity differ significantly between the injured athlete and the group of uninjured athletes and controls (P-values <0.05). However, only infraspinatus tendon degeneration corresponded to the injury histories. There was a high similarity of sonographic spectrum of abnormal findings among the groups. Longitudinal follow-ups are required to determine the clinical importance of the sonographic spectrums and the occurrences of abnormal finding in asymptomatic athletes' shoulders."

Informed consent was obtained. Authors evaluated ability of nonphysician crewmember to obtain diagnostic-quality musculoskeletal ultrasonographic (US) data of the shoulder by following a just-in-time training algorithm and using real-time remote guidance aboard the International Space Station (ISS). ISS Expedition-9 crewmembers attended a 2.5-hour didactic and hands-on US training session 4 months before launch. Aboard the ISS, they completed a 1-hour computer-based Onboard Proficiency Enhancement program 7 days before examination. Crewmembers did not receive specific training in shoulder anatomy or shoulder US techniques. Evaluation of astronaut shoulder integrity was done by using a Human Research Facility US system. Crew used special positioning techniques for subject and operator to facilitate US in microgravity environment. Common anatomic reference points aided initial probe placement. Real-time US video of shoulder was transmitted to remote experienced sonologists in Telescience Center at Johnson Space Center. Probe manipulation and equipment adjustments were guided with verbal commands from remote sonologists to astronaut operators to complete rotator cuff evaluation. Comprehensive US of crewmember's shoulder included transverse and longitudinal images of biceps and supraspinatus tendons and articular cartilage surface. Total examination time required to guide astronaut operator to acquire necessary images was approximately 15 minutes. Multiple arm and probe positions were used to acquire dynamic video images that were of excellent quality to allow evaluation of shoulder integrity. Postsession download and analysis of high-fidelity US images collected onboard demonstrated additional anatomic detail that could be used to exclude subtle injury. Musculoskeletal US can be performed in space by minimally trained operators by using remote guidance. This technique can be used to evaluate shoulder integrity in symptomatic crewmembers after strenuous extravehicular activities or to monitor microgravity-associated changes in musculoskeletal anatomy. Just-in-time training, combined with remote experienced physician guidance, may provide a useful approach to complex medical tasks performed by nonexperienced personnel in a variety of remote settings, including current and future space programs."

The effectiveness of using porcine SIS as a tissue scaffold for reinforcement of rotator cuff repair is unclear. This study evaluates both clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up at 6 months in patients with large and massive rotator cuff tears treated with open repair and SIS reinforcement or interpositional grafting. Eleven consecutive patients who underwent open rotator cuff repair with SIS augmentation for large or massive tears were selected retrospectively, and their charts were reviewed. Magnetic resonance images were then obtained at least 6 months after the index procedure. Patients were evaluated clinically and with a questionnaire, and an American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder score was calculated. Results showed retear on MRI in 10 of 11 patients with recurrence of large, retracted tears. One repair remained intact by MRI evaluation at 10 months. Clinically, there was no statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative shoulder scores by use of a paired t test analysis (P =.70). Five patients had worse scores postoperatively. We concluded that, though SIS xenografting may be effective in other areas of the body for tendon healing, its use in reinforcement of large and massive rotator cuff repairs seems to be ineffective and does not improve clinical outcome."

Spectral analysis of flow signals was performed in all patients. Ten patients (six with tendonitis, four with tenosynovitis) were rewired after medical therapy. Six healthy volunteers were also examined for control purposes. Three different patterns of flow distribution were found in patients with tendonitis and active tenosynovitis. The vessels of tendons without tendon sheaths began with great peduncles at the level of the peritendinous soft tissues and were then distributed inside the tendon (pattern I). A clear peritendinous hypervascular pattern was found in all active tenosynovitis, but no vessels were found inside the tendons (pattern II). In some cases of intratendinous or partial lesions PD-US revealed some vessels located near or inside the lesion (pattern II). On spectral analysis these vessels corresponded to arteries with a low resistance index or small venules. PD-US revealed a significant reduction of flow signals in patients rewired after medical therapy. No pathological flow signals were found either in patients with stenosing tenosynovitis or in the control group. PD-US gives us an in vivo confirmation of tendon vascularity.

Mean global Constant score improved from 43 to 71.5 points, mean pain score from 6.3 to 13.2, mean anterior flexion from 100 to 157 degrees, and force in elevation from 2.3 to 3 kg. Two thirds of patients had no humeral head migration. Of the 18 patients whose flap was examined by magnetic resonance imaging, 15 had no tear and 12 had a flap signal of muscle intensity; mean flap thickness was 5 mm. Pre-operative factors associated with poorer outcomes were upwards humeral head migration with a subacromial space smaller than 6 mm, presence of glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and supraspinatus amyotrophy greater than 40%. Deltoid flap reconstruction is a valid option in this patient population."
CD009020,0,15160255,0,Calcifying tendinitis of the rotator cuff with cortical bone erosion.,"Calcifying tendinitis occurs most commonly in the rotator cuff tendons, particularly involving the supraspinatus tendon insertion, and is often asymptomatic. Cortical erosion secondary to calcifying tendinitis has been reported in multiple locations, including in the rotator cuff tendons. We present a pathologically proven case of symptomatic calcifying tendinitis involving the infraspinatus tendon with cortical erosion with correlative radiographic, CT, and MR findings. The importance of considering this diagnosis when evaluating lytic lesions of the humerus and the imaging differential diagnosis of calcifying tendinitis and cortical erosion are discussed."

CD009020,0,15150645,0,[Shoulder instability].,"Shoulder instability is a common clinical feature leading to recurrent pain and limited range of motion within the glenohumeral joint. Instability can be due a single traumatic event, general joint laxity or repeated episodes of microtrauma. Differentiation between traumatic and atraumatic forms of shoulder instability requires careful history and a systemic clinical examination. Shoulder laxity has to be differentiated from true instability followed by the clinical assessment of direction and degree of glenohumeral translation. Conventional radiography and CT are used for the diagnosis of bony lesions. MR imaging and MR arthrography help in the detection of soft tissue affection, especially of the glenoid labrum and the capsuloligamentous complex. The most common lesion involving the labrum is the anterior labral tear, associated with capsuloperiostal stripping (Bankart lesion). A number of variants of the Bankart lesion have been described, such as ALPSA, SLAP or HAGL lesions. The purpose of this review is to highlight different forms of shoulder instability and its associated radiological findings with a focus on MR imaging."
CD009020,0,15150644,0,[Conservative treatment and rehabilitation of shoulder problems].,"The shoulder joint has an important influence on arm- and hand function. Therefore, activities of daily living, working and leisure time can be negatively influenced by diseases of the shoulder joint. Problems of the shoulder joint can be induced by muscular dysbalance and poor body posture. There is a strong relationship between shoulder function and body posture. Conservative treatment and rehabilitation of the shoulder joint aims at improving the local dysfunction of the shoulder joint as well as at improving function and social participation. Antiinflammatory and pain medication, exercise, occupational, electro-, ultrasound and shock wave therapy, massage, thermotherapy and pulsed electromagnetic fields are used as conservative treatments. Exercise therapy aims at improving muscular performance, joint mobility and body posture. Occupational therapy aims at improving functional movements for daily living and work. Electrotherapy is primarily used to relieve pain. Shock wave and ultrasound therapy proved to be an effective treatment for patients with calcific tendinitis. The subacromial impingement syndrome can be effectively treated by conservative therapy."
CD009020,0,15125393,0,[Ultrasonography methods in the diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy].,"Bone disease, i.e. renal osteodystrophy, is commonly seen in patients with chronic renal failure. It encompasses all the disorders of mineral and bone metabolism associated with chronic renal insufficiency, i.e. secondary hyperparathyroidism, retention and accumulation of beta 2 microglobulin and aluminum. The most frequent cause of renal osteodystrophy is secondary hyperthyroidism, with a consequence of high turnover bone disease. Secondary hyperparathyroidism, i.e. increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and parathyroid gland hyperplasia, develops early in the course of chronic renal insufficiency. Hypocalcemia, phosphate retention and deficiency of calcitriol stimulate PTH synthesis and secretion and parathyroid cell proliferation, i.e. hyperplasia. Parathyroid cell proliferation is initially polyclonal (diffuse hyperplasia), and later it is monoclonal or multiclonal (nodular hyperplasia). Calcitriol receptors as well as calcium-sensing receptors are significantly reduced in parathyroid glands in nodular hyperplasia. Patients with such parathyroid gland hyperplasia are often resistant to vitamin D therapy. A specific form of bone disease is beta 2 amyloidosis. Destructive arthropathy, cystic changes and carpal tunnel syndrome are clinical manifestations of dialysis-related amyloidosis, which is one of the major complications in patients on longterm hemodialysis. Aluminum intoxication leads to the low turnover bone disease and consequential osteomalacia or aplastic bone lesions, the cause of which has not yet been fully clarified. Ultrasound can be a useful, economical and noninvasive method in the evaluation of renal osteodystrophy. Ultrasound waves are very important for noninvasive imaging of soft tissue, especially parathyroid glands, pathologic changes of the joints, and for detection of metastatic calcifications. They are also useful in the evaluation of skeletal status in dialysis patients. Ultrasound waves of a frequency above the limit of human hearing are used in the morphological diagnosis of parathyroid gland. Today, because of its simplicity and non-invasiveness, it is a generally accepted method for the detection of enlarged parathyroid gland in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, for the monitoring of pathologic changes, and for making decisions on the method of treatment based on the size and number of parathyroid glands. Ultrasound can distinguish nodal from diffuse parathyroid hyperplasia. Under ultrasound guidance it is possible to perform fine needle aspiration biopsy, to confirm ultrasound findings, and percutaneous inactivation of parathyroid gland (PEI) with alcohol. Ultrasound is useful in the diagnosis of pathologic changes of the musculoskeletal system in patients with beta 2 amyloidosis, to assess the process of its spread, especially in the shoulder joint where the changes are most pronounced (rotator cuff thickness, amyloid deposits as hyperechogenic pads, and detection of fluid in the joint), but it can also be used to examine other joints as well as soft tissue in which metastatic calcifications may occur. Standard ultrasound equipment (pulse-echo) and linear probe of 5-13 MHz are used, also serving for ultrasound examination of the neck, joints and soft tissue. Quantitative bone ultrasonometry is based on different physical characteristics of the ultrasound including: transmission, Speed Of Sound (SOS) in meters/sec and Broad Band Attenuation (BUA) in dB/MHz, and different concepts of the apparatus. These parameters depend on the strength and architecture of the bones and describe better the changes in bone structure in dialysis patients by calculation of the Stiffness Index (QUI), better than the standard bone densitometry by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, which only measures bone density. Combined ultrasound measurement of the bone in several locations may be successful in monitoring dialysis patients."

The results of 282 shoulder sonograms in patients ultimately treated surgically were included. Findings at surgery were recorded and compared with those documented during the ultrasound examination. Ultrasound findings included 118 full-thickness and 143 partial-thickness rotator cuff tears and 6 intact cuffs confirmed at surgery. One patient with a partial supraspinatus tear on ultrasound was intact at surgery, nine with complete supraspinatus tears had partial-thickness tears at surgery, one with an intact supraspinatus had a full-thickness tear at surgery, and four with partial-thickness supraspinatus tears had full-thickness tears at surgery. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 94.1%, 96.1%, 96.6%, and 93.2%, respectively, for partial-thickness tears; 95.9%, 94.3%, 92.9%, and 96.8%, respectively, for full-thickness tears; and 99.6%, 85.7%, 99.6%, and 85.7%, respectively, when the rotator cuff was evaluated for damage (either partial- or full-thickness tears).

Fifty-eight patients in whom conservative management failed underwent standardized MRI with intravenous gadolinium enhancement and arthroscopic evaluation. The prevalence of supraspinatus tendon, long head of the biceps tendon, and acromioclavicular joint pathology in this population was high: 79.3%, 66%, and 56%, respectively. MRI was highly accurate in detecting full-thickness supraspinatus tears and acromioclavicular joint pathology. However, it had poor concordance with arthroscopy in diagnosing pathology in the biceps tendon and in classifying the curvature of the acromion. A smaller number of other abnormal structures were identified in this population of patients, including labral abnormalities (superior labral anterior-posterior and Bankart tears), Hill-Sachs lesions, and articular surface damage. Concordance between MRI and arthroscopy would increase with improved radiologist-surgeon communication, a more reliable classification of pathology, and possibly the use of intraarticular contrast. This study demonstrates that patients presenting with the clinical findings of shoulder impingement syndrome represent a heterogeneous population. Overall, MRI is a useful tool in the identification of shoulder pathology; however, the clinical correlation of this information and the assessment of outcomes remains unknown."

Overhead athletes, in particular, place great demands on the shoulder and supporting structures. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is well suited to evaluation of the osseous structures and soft tissues of the shoulder and plays an important role in evaluation of shoulder pain in athletes. Primary extrinsic impingement is well evaluated on MR imaging as are the less common posterior superior glenoid impingement and subcoracoid impingement. Rotator cuff tendinosis as well as partial- and full-thickness tears are frequently encountered in the athletic shoulder.

The primary factors for the development of impingement are a curved or hook-shaped anterior acromion as well as subacromial osteophytes, which may lead to tearing of the supraspinatus tendon. Secondary impingement is mainly caused by calcific tendinopathy, glenohumeral instability, os acromiale and degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joint. Conventional radiographs are initially obtained, mainly for evaluation of the bony structures of the shoulder. If available, sonography can be used for detection of lesions and tears of the rotator cuff. Finally, MR-imaging provides detailed information about the relationship of the acromion and the acromioclavicular joint to the rotator cuff itself. In many cases however, no morphologic cause for impingement syndrome can be found. While patients are initially treated conservatively, chronic disease usually requires surgical intervention."

CD009020,0,15037909,0,Isolated ruptures of the supraspinatus muscle.,"We rarely encounter isolated ruptures of the supraspinatus muscle. At the Clinic of Orthopedics at the Faculty Hospital in Olomouc, we encountered only 21 cases out of 385 arthroscopic operation cases from October 1998 to October 2003. The patients were examined by USG, 5 patients were examined arthrographically and 3 patients underwent MRI examination. Of these 21 patients, only 3 were operated for acute post-injury haemarthrosis of the shoulder joint. During arthroscopic operation, an isolated rupture of the supraspinatus muscle was discovered in all these patients. The remaining 40 patients were only treated at our clinic for problems associated with impingement syndrome after an interval of 3-11 months and were indicated for operational therapy for the rupture of the supraspinatus muscle, verified sonographically and by MRI. Surgically we performed end to end sutures in 12 patients, in 9 cases we performed refixation using 1-2 titanium MITEK anchors. We supplemented the work by a detailed anatomical study of the supraspinatus muscle on 27 cadaverous anatomical preparations. It was noted that the supraspinatus muscle may be divided into three parts, with a superficial and deep layer of muscle fascicles. An aponeurotic insertion tendon runs through the center, to which part of the superficial muscle fascicles are attached. The muscle fascicles, including the central attachment tendon, run across the superior margin of the shoulder joint and by broad tendon are attached to the superior surface of the greater tubercle of the humerus. Together with the long head of the biceps muscle, they act as a significant shoulder stabiliser. The authors believe that due to the course of the muscle fascicles, this muscle acts as a significant shoulder stabiliser and a powerful abductor and elevator in the shoulder joint. The inferior portion of the muscle fascicles acts as an external rotator of the shoulder."

The value of MR arthrography is substantiated by the capability to assess associated diagnoses which are otherwise difficult to assess. Associated diagnoses include full- and partial thickness tears of supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons, pulley lesions, and adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder).

Six US signs, which included ""nonvisualization"", ""focal depression"", ""focal thinning"", ""focal hypoechoic cleft"", ""floating bright spots"" and ""focal heterogeneous hypoechogenicity"" in rotator cuffs (RCs), were emphasized, but only ""focal heterogeneous hypoechogenicity"" favored partial-thickness tear (10/14, 71%). All the other five signs, including ""floating bright spots"" (not pointed out in literatures), were suggestive of full-thickness tear. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for US to detect RCTs were 95%, 90%, 97%, 82% and 94%, respectively.

CD009020,0,14984190,0,Arthroscopic evaluation and management of rotator cuff tears.,"The development of arthroscopic techniques has provided the shoulder surgeon with new opportunities to improve the chances of salvaging these difficult rotator cuff tears while generally avoiding the potential disastrous consequences attendant to the open procedures. The arthroscope can be used to review and document the status of the joint and cuff, assess the tear pattern, debride damaged tissues, and smooth the acromion. In addition, a trained shoulder arthroscopist can mobilize the available tissues and repair any viable tendon to bone, without damage to the overlying muscles, through small cosmetic incisions in an outpatient surgery setting. If there proves to be an irreparable injury, debridement and bone smoothing can be readily performed, avoiding iatrogenic injury to the remaining healthy tissues, especially the deltoid muscle. The patient and the surgeon must accept that the arthroscope is merely a helpful surgical tool, a convenient method to visualize the anatomy without damaging other tissues. When one attempts to repair a massive cuff tear, even with the aid of the arthroscope, there are no miracles or magic involved and often the results are less than perfect. Fortunately, once one can see the relevant anatomy, the opportunities to safely repair the tissues are then unprecedented."
CD009020,0,14984188,0,Subscapularis tears: arthroscopic repair techniques.,"The subscapularis is an essential component of normal shoulder function. An intact subscapularis muscle provides the anterior moment for the transverse plane force couple. Any disruption of the subscapularis disrupts normal glenohumeral biomechanics. If this occurs the shoulder functions abnormally, leading to pain and disability. A thorough history and physical examination lead the surgeon to the diagnosis of a torn subscapularis. Radiographs and MRI are helpful in delineating the rotator cuff tear pattern and other intra-articular lesions and in determining subcoracoid stenosis. Advancements with arthroscopic techniques have enabled surgeons to deal with subscapularis tears arthroscopically. There are seven key points to arthroscopic subscapularis repair: (1) portal placement (posterior portal, anterior portal, anterolateral portal, and accessory anterolateral portal), (2) visualization of the pathology by using a 30 degree and a 70 degree arthroscope, (3) manipulating the arm into maximal internal rotation to assist in assessing the tendon's relationship to its footprint, (4) appropriate anchor placement, (5) suture passage through the tendon, (6) tying secure arthroscopic knots, and (7) appropriate rehabilitation that minimizes stress on the repair. With these principles in mind, the shoulder surgeon can address disruptions of the anterior rotator cuff by repairing the subscapularis, thus alleviating the disability associated with this overlooked and under-appreciated pathology."

For optimal soft-tissue visualization, MR imaging and MR arthrography are widely used. Several factors, however, may decrease the accuracy of MR imaging in the evaluation of the postoperative shoulder. These factors include surgical distortions of native anatomy, changes in the signal intensity of tissues, and image degradation caused by metallic artifacts. To maximize the accuracy of MR imaging, the radiologist must select the most appropriate pulse sequences and techniques for the given anatomic structure and the suspected postoperative condition. To avoid magnetic susceptibility artifacts at MR imaging, inversion recovery may be used instead of fat saturation, and fast spin-echo sequences may be used instead of conventional spin-echo sequences or gradient-echo sequences. MR arthrography is most useful for optimal delineation of the rotator cuff, capsulolabral structures, and tendon defects. To achieve accurate image interpretation, the radiologist must be familiar with the arthroscopic and the open surgical techniques currently used to repair internal derangements of the glenohumeral joint, as well as with the typical imaging findings in each postoperative situation."

The supraspinatus tendon was pulled proximally with the force of 10 N at 0 degrees, 53 N at 30 degrees, and 115 N at 60 degrees of abduction. The area of high principal stress maximum was observed on the articular side of the supraspinatus tendon, which shifted toward the insertion as the arm was abducted. High stress concentration on the articular side of the supraspinatus tendon near its insertion during arm elevation may explain the frequent occurrence of rotator cuff tears at this site."

Fatty degeneration was evaluated for each muscle with the 5-stage grading system developed by Goutallier et al. A global fatty degeneration index (GFDI), the mean value of the 3 muscles, was calculated for each shoulder. Cuff integrity was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (116 cases) or computed arthrotomography scan (104 cases) at a mean 37 months' follow-up, and functional outcomes were evaluated with the Constant score. A recurrent tear was found in 79 cases (36%) and was more frequently encountered in posterosuperior tears. The likelihood of a recurrent tear was greater for tendons whose muscle showed fatty degeneration greater than grade 1. Fatty degeneration of the infraspinatus or subscapularis muscles had an influence on supraspinatus tendon outcome. A GFDI lower than 0.5 was necessary to yield less than 25% retears. The mean global Constant score was 75 at revision, significantly lower when a retear was present (70.5 versus 77.5). In the subgroup of watertight cuffs, it was lower when GFDI was higher.

Analysis was performed with a subtracted SUV, obtained by subtracting the SUV of the muscle at rest from that after exercise. Fusion imaging studies involving FDG positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging would provide a novel strategy with the potential of improving on the limited resolution of PET images. In this study this relatively new strategy revealed a similar decrease in the supraspinatus SUV in cases involving both complete and partial tears. The SUV in the infraspinatus and subscapularis also decreased, regardless of whether these muscles were intact or ruptured; the SUV in the deltoid remained basically unchanged. With the use of this exercise protocol, FDG PET might prove useful for objective evaluation of rotator cuff muscle activity."
CD009020,0,14656681,0,Glenoid version and rotator cuff tears.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between rotator cuff (RC) tear and the orientation of the glenoid. Ninety-six shoulders (94 patients) that underwent open RC repair were grouped according to the type of tear. We measured on MRI the acromio-glenoid angle (AG) and the supraspinatus fossa glenoid angle on the anterior-posterior (SGAP) and axial (SGAX) views. RC patients had a smaller AG angle (76+/-7 degrees vs. 86+/-10 degrees ) and a larger SGAP angle (112+/-6 degrees vs. 102+/-7 degrees ) compared to controls (p<0.001). We also found a highly significant difference (p<0.001) in glenoid version measured by SGAX between anterior cuff tears (-5+/-4 degrees ) and posterior cuff tears (3+/-3 degrees ). Furthermore, we identified an association between RC tear and the orientation of the glenoid relative to the axis of the supraspinatus fossa. Greater retroversion is predictive of an anterior cuff injury and greater anteversion is predictive of a posterior cuff injury."
CD009020,0,14652725,0,[Reconstruction of big rotator cuff ruptures. A new technique of tendon refixation with the corkscrew suture anchor system].,"Tendon retraction and fatty degeneration is a major problem in repair of massive rotator cuff tears. Especially in the transosseous refixation technique, a tension-free refixation cannot be obtained in all cases. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the postoperative results using a new tension-free reinsertion technique with a Corkscrew suture anchor system. Thirty patients (25 males, 5 females) with complete one and two tendon tears underwent open rotator cuff repair (rupture of one tendon: n=14, 47%). The torn tendons were mobilized and reinserted medially to reduce tension. Medialization was achieved by inserting tendon near the osteochondral border in a bony trough. The number of implanted suture anchors ranged from 2 to 6 (mean: 3.56). The mean age was 56 years (39-68 years) with a follow-up of 24 months (17-33 months). In one patient physical and sonographic examination showed a complete and in two patients a partial rerupture. A temporarily frozen shoulder occurred in two cases. No infection or rejection response was seen. In no case was revision surgery necessary. No displacement or loosening of the Corkscrew anchors was noticed. The constant score improved from 45 points preoperatively to 85 points at the time of follow-up (mean). The Corkscrew suture anchor system in combination with the new suture technique offers the possibility of a stable reinsertion even in reduced calcified bone structure. This facilitates good conditions for stable fibroblastic healing. Our midterm results show good osseous union combined with a low rerupture rate."

CD009020,0,14612636,0,Magnetic resonance imaging in quantitative analysis of rotator cuff muscle volume.,"Tears of the rotator cuff are accompanied by muscle atrophy, which has direct implications on patient outcome after rotator cuff surgery. However, no reliable method exists to determine muscle volumes in situ. The current authors evaluated the reliability of magnetic resonance imaging in assessing rotator cuff muscle volumes. Muscle volumes were determined in 10 shoulders from cadavers using two methods: (1). oblique sagittal shoulder scans were obtained, the contours of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor, and subscapularis muscles were traced, and muscle volumes were calculated using image analysis software; and (2). rotator cuff muscles were dissected and muscle volumes were measured by water displacement. The average magnetic resonance imaging volume of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor, and subscapularis muscles were 36 +/- 12, 96 +/- 41, and 99 +/- 33 mL, respectively. There was a significant correlation between magnetic resonance imaging and water displacement measurements. The intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were less than 4%. The results indicate the magnetic resonance imaging is a reliable method to determine rotator cuff muscle volumes with good intraobserver and interobserver variability. This method may prove valuable preoperative assessment of rotator cuff muscles and prediction of outcome after rotator cuff repair."
CD009020,0,14610684,0,Ultrasonographic rotator-cuff changes in veteran tennis players: the effect of hand dominance and comparison with clinical findings.,"The aim of this study was to correlate sonographic abnormalities of the rotator cuff with clinical findings in veteran tennis players. One hundred fifty individuals playing competition-level tennis, aged from 35 to 77 years (mean age 55 years), underwent physical and US examinations of their shoulders. The US abnormalities found in the dominant shoulder were compared with those observed in the non-dominant shoulder and in different subsets of players defined by the absence or presence of former and/or current pain. Tears of the long head of the biceps tendon were seen only in dominant shoulders ( n=8), and tears (23 complete and 20 partial) of the supraspinatus tendon were observed in 43 dominant vs 16 (3 complete and 13 partial) contralateral shoulders ( p<0.001). Subscapularis tendon calcifications were depicted in 23 dominant vs 12 contralateral shoulders ( p<0.05). Seventy players had no pain, 49 had former-but-not-current pain, and 31 had current pain. Abnormal thickening (>2 mm) and effusion of the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa and complete tear of the supraspinatus tendon were more frequent in the latter two groups ( p<0.001 and p<0.05), respectively. Although 90% of the players with a complete supraspinatus tear had experienced former pain, no relationship was found between current pain and the presence of a supraspinatus tear or tendon calcification. The rotator cuff may present important asymptomatic lesions, such as complete tears of the supraspinatus tendon or calcifications, that do not prevent the playing competitive tennis. The only US abnormality associated with pain was subacromial-subdeltoid bursa effusion."

CD009020,0,14578661,0,[Diagnostic imaging of the rotator cuff].,"The importance of imaging modalities in the evaluation of the rotator cuff has increased thanks to the development of non-invasive methods. An optimum application of the technique, appreciation of the anatomical details and imaging pitfalls, and proper interpretation of clinical findings should be incorporated in order to increase diagnostic accuracy. Ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used for rotator cuff pathologies. The former has a high diagnostic accuracy in full-thickness tears, but requires operator dependency and long-term training. Both US and MRI require sophisticated equipment and present difficulties in distinguishing between partial and small full-thickness tears. In full-thickness tears, MRI may be more appropriate if imaging findings are likely to alter the course of surgical treatment. However, it is not necessary in patients in whom US may clearly show tendinosis. Magnetic resonance imaging or MR arthrography may be required in order to evaluate partial tears or suspicious small full-thickness tears in patients unresponsive to conservative therapy. A close collaboration is essential between the radiologist and the shoulder surgeon in the interpretation of clinical findings. The diagnostic accuracy will increase if the examinations are performed by a musculoskeletal radiologist."

CD009020,0,14565754,0,Chronic massive rotator cuff tears: evaluation and management.,"Most studies of rotator cuff repairs report high success rates. However, the majority of these studies combine the results of surgical management of rotator cuff tears of various sizes; few published reports specifically evaluate the management of chronic massive tears. Chronic massive rotator cuff tears may be acute traumatic, chronic atraumatic, or acute-on-chronic. A detailed history and thorough physical examination often are sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Radiographic evaluation can reveal osseous changes suggestive of pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging can determine the size of rotator cuff tears and status of the muscles but generally is not necessary for patients who are not candidates for surgery. Chronic massive rotator cuff tears without glenohumeral arthritis can be managed nonsurgically or with sub-acromial debridement, rotator cuff repair, or rotator cuff reconstruction. However, treatment of these patients is challenging, and results are comparatively inferior to those of treating patients with smaller rotator cuff tears."

CD009020,0,14500210,1,Usefulness of the simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics technique during MRI of the shoulder.,"The simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics (SMASH) technique is a parallel imaging technique that uses fewer echoes than conventional techniques to obtain the desired resolution. Production of images occurs more quickly with parallel imaging than with conventional imaging. This study assesses the usefulness of the SMASH technique for MRI of the shoulder. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Five experienced musculoskeletal radiologists prospectively interpreted MRIs of the shoulder in 50 consecutive patients. All patients underwent a complete MRI examination of the shoulder on a 1.5-T commercially available scanner. Axial fat-saturated proton density-weighted, coronal T1-weighted, and coronal and sagittal fat-saturated T2-weighted sequences were performed. Patients also underwent SMASH T2-weighted imaging in the coronal and sagittal planes. Coronal and sagittal SMASH T2-weighted imaging took approximately 50% as long to complete compared with conventional T2-weighted imaging. Each radiologist interpreted MRIs of the shoulder without knowing whether the images were obtained using the SMASH or the fat-saturated T2-weighted technique. Twenty-eight of the 50 patients also underwent subsequent arthroscopy, and the results were compared with MRI interpretations based on SMASH and fat-saturated T2-weighted images."

Twenty-five patients with the diagnosis of full-thickness rotator cuff tear were included. Electrodiagnostic testing, including nerve conduction studies and needle examination, was performed on all patients. There were 7 abnormal electromyographic examinations. The most common diagnosis was upper trunk brachial plexopathy severely affecting the axillary nerve (4/7), followed by suprascapular neuropathy (2/7) and cervical radiculopathy (1/7). The prevalence of associated peripheral neuropathy was found to be 28%. Greater degrees of atrophy were significantly associated with the presence of neuropathy in these patients. Careful neurologic screening in all patients and electromyographic examination in clinically suspicious groups are recommended in patients with full-thickness cuff tears before surgical repair."
CD009020,0,12934024,0,Rotator cuff repair in spinal cord injury patients.,"Previous studies on the treatment of rotator cuff tears in wheelchair-bound patients have concentrated on nonsurgical management. We conducted a retrospective review to determine the effectiveness of surgical repair of rotator cuff tears in spinal cord-injured patients. Five male patients with rotator cuff tears confirmed by physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging underwent rotator cuff repair. Two of eight shoulders were revisions. The patients were evaluated postoperatively with the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Scoring System. These results were compared with preoperative functional assessment. Patients were given a subjective questionnaire to assess their overall experience. Postoperative range of motion improved in 6 of 8 shoulders. Strength was increased in 6 of 8 shoulders. Patients reported satisfaction with the results in 7 of 8 shoulders, and all 5 patients would recommend the procedure to other spinal cord injury patients. At recent follow-up, 7 of 8 shoulders returned to their preinjury level of function. Surgery for spinal cord injury patients with rotator cuff tears can improve their functional capability and autonomy while reducing their pain. Compliance with the demanding postoperative rehabilitation is essential; therefore proper patient selection is crucial for optimal results."

The study comprised 27 shoulders in 26 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging before surgery because of complete tears of the rotator cuff and who were treated with primary repair or by the patch graft technique because primary repair was not feasible. The length and width of each tear, the thickness of the supraspinatus muscle at the superior margin of the glenoid, and the presence or absence of a high signal intensity in the infraspinatus muscle were statistically analyzed. Primary repair was often not feasible when both the length and width of the tear exceeded 40 mm on a preoperative magnetic resonance image, when the supraspinatus muscle was thin at the superior margin of the glenoid, and when a high signal intensity was observed in the infraspinatus muscle."

The patch group (group P) consisted of nine patients with nine shoulders (six men, three women) with a mean age of 62.8+/-6.9 years. The McLaughlin group (group M) consisted of 12 patients with 12 shoulders (ten men, two women) with a mean age of 52.3+/-8.6 years. Mean follow-up was 2 years 11 months in group P and 4 years 2 months in group M. Using the shoulder scoring system of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA score), the total score improved post-operatively in both groups. In group P, the post-operative score was 91.7 (pre-operative score 47.9) and in group M 92.0 (pre-operative score 54.2). Tears recurred in three shoulders within 2 months of the McLaughlin procedure, and these patients were excluded from the study.

CD009020,0,12822240,0,[Surgical management of traumatic lesions of the axillary nerve: 83 cases].,"Axillary nerve injuries still go undiagnosed far too often despite their frequency. However the quality of the outcome depends on expert management and prompt surgery. To optimise the latter, we re-examined 83 operated cases of traumatic lesions of the axillary nerve. We analysed the neurological and functional recovery of these patients by means of a follow-up evaluation at 6 years postop. The results were classified by age, mechanism of injury, delay to surgery and the presence or otherwise of associated neurological or osteo-articular lesions. We highlighted that a high index of suspicion ought to exist in all cases of trauma to the shoulder in a patient aged more than 40, any injury associated with palsy of the long head of triceps and in the case of an osteo-articular lesion due to high-velocity trauma. A complete lack of shoulder abduction must always prompt a search for a lesion of the axillary nerve as well as a suprascapular nerve palsy or rotator cuff lesion. There are few literature reports of surgical management of this particular nerve injury. An early MRI scan as part of the management should improve results by a reduction in the delay before surgery. As a result of our investigation we conclude that a lesion of the axillary nerve without signs of recovery at 3 months should be referred to a centre specialized in peripheral nerve surgery."

Thirty-three patients (19 with open and 14 with endoscopic decompression) were available for followup. Clinical and ultrasonographic investigations were done at followup. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate prospectively the clinical and sonographic results after open decompression and after endoscopic decompression. Apportionment of age and gender was similar in both groups. The followup was 15.7 months for patients after open decompression and 17.1 months for patients after endoscopic decompression. The average Patte score was 84.5 points (84.4 for patients who had endoscopic decompression and 84.6 for patients who had open decompression). Corresponding results were found with a Constant and Murley score of 96.6 points (97.6 for patients who had endoscopic decompression and 95.8 for patients who had open decompression). In the endoscopic group physiotherapy was recommended for 5 weeks more than in the open surgery group. Similar results were seen for the incapacity to work in both groups with 4.6 weeks for the patients who had endoscopic surgery and 5 weeks for the patients who had open surgery. No nerve injuries, wound infections, or other postoperative complications were found. Comparison of both surgical methods showed good clinical and score results. Endoscopic and open surgery are equally effective in the treatment of chronic calcifying tendinopathy."
CD009020,0,12735621,0,"Correlation of age, acromial morphology, and rotator cuff tear pathology diagnosed by ultrasound in asymptomatic patients.","The importance of acromial morphology in the pathogenesis of rotator cuff tears remains controversial. Some surgeons place great emphasis on acromial morphology and others feel that acromial shape is a result of cuff tear pathology rather than the cause. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was an association between acromial morphology, age, and rotator cuff tears found by ultrasound in asymptomatic volunteer subjects with no past history of shoulder symptoms. One hundred eighteen outlet x-rays and ultrasound scans were performed in 59 asymptomatic patients in various age groups. Acromial morphology and the age of the patients were then correlated with the ultrasound findings. Older patients were noted to have a high incidence of type II and type III acromions (93% of those over 70). Full- and partial-thickness tears were more commonly seen in patients with type II or type III acromions compared with type I. Patients over 50 years had a high incidence of full-thickness tears (40%), but the incidence did not increase with increasing age past 50. These findings lend credence to the multifactorial etiology of rotator cuff tears. The patient's age (degeneration) and acromial morphology (impingement) are two of the factors involved in causing rotator cuff tears. The incidence of cuff tears and type III acromions was high in this group of entirely asymptomatic volunteer subjects. Surgeons should interpret radiologically hooked or curved acromions as well as rotator cuff tears diagnosed with ultrasound or other modalities with caution. It may well be that both of these findings should be regarded as part of the natural ageing process."

Four male elite athletes with recurrent shoulder pain were seen a mean of 7.5 months (range, 3-10 months) after initial arthroscopy. Three of the cases involved superior labrum anterior-to-posterior (SLAP) lesion stabilization, and the fourth case was a rotator cuff (RTC) repair. In the three labral repairs, the implant had broken and the unabsorbed fragments were visible with magnetic resonance imaging. The device used in the RTC repair showed no signs of absorption. All 4 patients underwent arthroscopic removal of the polymer tack fragments to alleviate their symptoms, 2 of whom had foreign-body reactions that required synovectomy. On the basis of clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging, 2 of the SLAP lesions and the RTC tear had healed. The third patient with a SLAP lesion required arthroscopic debridement of a portion of the labrum. The intact RTC implant had backed out of its insertion point. In all 3 labral repairs, the polymerized lactic acid implant experienced a mechanical failure near the head-shaft junction. We theorize that the labral implants failed because of the variable rate of degradation along the shaft of the devices from the intraarticular to intraosseous regions."

Twenty-six shoulders of twenty-five consecutive patients were included in a prospective study that compared the preoperative accuracy of magnetic resonance arthrography and ultrasonography for tear size in millimeters with intraoperative findings. No significant differences were found between intraoperative, ultrasonographic, and magnetic resonance arthrographic data for the width of tears. Adoption of a ""curved line measurement"" for ultrasonographic evaluation of large tears eliminated the tendency of ultrasonography to underestimate tears greater than or equal to 35 mm in width. No significant differences were found between intraoperative, ultrasonographic, and magnetic resonancearthrographic data for retraction of tears. However, a limitation of ultrasonography to evaluate retractions of more than 30 mm was found. Therefore, ultrasound is of equal value for tears less than 30 mm, but magnetic resonance arthrography is more accurate for tears greater than 30 mm."

Shoulder pain at the work place is associated with job strain: lack of control and work with elevated arms and hand tools. Clinical skills and knowledge about red and yellow flags and biomechanics are essential to perform a systematic and reliable evaluation. The diagnostic validity of clinical tests for rotator cuff tear, impingement syndrome and superior labral tears is equal or better than ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cortico-steroidal injections have documented short-term pain relief. Additionally, the physician should attempt to give the patient simple advice and reinforce active coping strategies. One randomized study suggests that a proper physiotherapy regimen and surgery are equally effective for the impingement syndrome.

CD009020,0,12640155,0,US of the shoulder: non-rotator cuff disorders.,"The most common indication for shoulder ultrasonography (US) is the diagnosis of rotator cuff disease. However, there is a spectrum of non-rotator cuff abnormalities that are amenable to US examination, including instability of the biceps tendon, glenohumeral joint, and acromioclavicular joint; arthropathies and bursites (inflammatory diseases, degenerative and infiltrative disorders, infections); nerve entrapment syndromes; and space-occupying lesions. Many of these conditions may be overlooked clinically or can even mimic rotator cuff tears, and US can help redirect the diagnosis if a complete shoulder examination rather than a simple rotator cuff assessment is performed. In addition, US can be remarkably helpful in guiding either needle aspiration procedures or local injection therapy in patients with synovial processes. Although radiography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and computed tomographic and MR arthrography are effective modalities for the evaluation of non-rotator cuff disorders, US is both less costly and less invasive and will likely be used more frequently in this setting as experience increases. Once adequate radiographs have been obtained to exclude apparent bone disorders, high-resolution US should be the first-line imaging modality in the assessment of non-rotator cuff disorders of the shoulder, assuming the study is performed with high-end equipment by an experienced examiner."

Many authors have reported on correlations between the MRI and operative findings of rotator cuff tears. However, MRI findings, history of symptoms and operative findings in our patients suggest that there was a discrepancy between symptoms and MRI findings dependent on the period from the injury. Operative findings also indicate that intratendinous tears might have occurred first in these patients then progressed to partial or full thickness tears over time. We concluded that physicians should keep rotator cuff pathology in mind even in patients whose MRI findings are negative but symptoms of rotator cuff tear persist."

Improvements in magnetic resonance techniques, including fast spin-echo imaging and fat saturation, have facilitated demonstration of tendinous abnormalities of the rotator cuff. Rotator cuff disease is multifactorial. Primary impingement within the coracoacromial arch, degeneration of the rotator cuff tendons, trauma, and glenohumeral instability may be contributing factors. Shoulder pain in athletes can be related to acute myotendinous and muscle injuries, which can be easily detected using magnetic resonance imaging."

The later occurs in the throwing athlete. The most common lesion involving the labrum is the anterior inferior labral tear, associated with capsuloperiosteal stripping (classic Bankart lesion). A number of variants of the Bankart lesion have been described recently and include the ALPSA lesion, SLAP lesion, and HAGHL lesion, among others. Lesions of the long head of the biceps tendon can be seen in isolation (tears, tendinosis, dislocation) or in association with rotator cuff and labral lesions. Conventional MR and MR arthrography have been extensively used for the preoperative diagnosis of these lesions, with reportedly good accuracy. An understanding of the normal anatomy and biomechanics of the shoulder joint is essential for proper interpretation of the MRI manifestations of these conditions."

The introduction of low-field MR systems for assessment of joint disorders seemed to be an option for lower costs. The purpose of this article is to summarize available experiences with low-field MR arthrography of the glenohumeral joint with respect to image quality and diagnostic accuracy in detecting labral and rotator cuff lesions. Up to now, there has been only a limited number of studies available dealing with low-field MR arthrography of the glenohumeral joint. They reveal that, despite a minor image quality in comparison with high-field imaging, low-field MR arthrography of the shoulder allows for sufficient evaluation of intra- and extra-articular structures in the detection of major abnormalities such as glenohumeral instability or rotator cuff disease. Furthermore, open-configured MR scanners enable kinematic studies: Besides the analysis of normal motion, pathological findings in patients with instabilities and impingement syndrome can be delineated. They further offer the possibility for performing MR imaging-guided arthrography of the shoulder. This was first described using an open C-arm scanner with a vertically oriented magnetic field so that MR arthrography may be performed in one setting."

The patient had a 1-year history of repeated calcifying tendinitis before being referred to our hospital. On the initial visit, radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed calcium deposition localized in the supraspinatus tendon without apparent tear. Three months after the first visit, MRI revealed a partial-thickness rotator cuff tear at the site of calcium deposition.

Thirty-seven patients with full thickness rotator cuff tears were evaluated by history, physical examination, and plain radiographs. Thirty patients had surgical intervention for their rotator cuff defects, and calipers were used intraoperatively to quantify the size of the tear in its largest diameter. The remaining seven patients were treated nonoperatively and the size of the tear was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging. Synovial fluid was obtained from all patients and analyzed for crystal content using an alizarin red stain. Synovial fluid also was analyzed for leukocyte count and differential, prostaglandin E, and matrix metalloproteinase. An unpaired Student's t test revealed that significantly higher levels of prostaglandin E were found in the synovial fluid of patients with apatite crystals, shown by alizarin red stain. Chi squared analysis showed that patients with elevated crystal levels were significantly more likely to have large rotator cuff tears or glenohumeral arthritis. Establishing such relations potentially can elucidate the etiology and treatment of this complex disorder.(2) (2)"
CD009020,0,12563364,0,[Surgical treatment of the impingement syndrome and of the rotator cuff tears: personal experience in 134 cases].,"The time-course covered by the original definition of scapulo-humeral periarthritis suggested by Duplay through the more recent term of subacromial impingement syndrome coined by Neer, follows the identification of the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to chronic subacromial impingement and degenerative tears of the rotator cuff. The Authors recall the functional-anatomic development evolution of the shoulder and the disequilibrium between the depressor and the elevator muscles which may promote the chronic friction against the acromion. However, the actual pathogenesis of the impingement still remains controversial. We evaluated 134 patients (81F, 53M, mean age 56.4 years) with chronic subacromial impingement syndrome. In 92 cases (69%) non traumatic tears of the rotator cuff were also present as confirmed by ultrasonography in 94 cases, CT in18 cases and magnetic resonance in 102 cases. The different tear patterns of the rotator cuff were classified as suggested by Ellman (L shaped, L reverse, triangular, trapezoidal and massive with retraction) and clinical results were analyzed following Sahlstrand clinical criteria and Costant numerical scale. According to the anatomical damage, patients were divided into those with impingement without severe cuff tendinopathy (42 cases), those with rotator cuff tears without loss of motion of the shoulder (32 cases) and those with cuff tears and loss of active motion (60 cases). The different surgical techniques and rehabilitation procedures after surgery are also reported. After a mean follow-up of 1.3 years (range 8 months - 2 years), good or excellent results were obtained in 91% of the patients without rotator cuff tears, in 87% of the patients with tears but without loss of motion and in 75% of the cases with loss of active motion. Our data demonstrate that in the majority of patients with chronic impingement syndrome and rotator cuff tears, surgical treatment shows high success rates. When surgery is associated with a careful rehabilitation programme it may frequently allow patients to return to their baseline function."

A thirty-one-year-old man presented with non-traumatic complaints of right shoulder pain and stiffness. After exclusion of other causes associated with shoulder pain, a diagnosis of suprascapular nerve entrapment was considered. Electromyographic activity of the right shoulder was compared with that of the left side and involvement of the infraspinatus muscle was detected, with the supraspinatus muscle appearing normal. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a ganglion cyst around the spinoglenoid notch. The patient underwent arthroscopic examination and open cyst excision. Arthroscopy did not show any labral tears. Pathological diagnosis was made as a cystic ganglion. On follow-up examinations, the patient's complaints disappeared and only minimal infraspinatus muscle atrophy was observed. Suprascapular nerve entrapment should be considered in the differential diagnosis of posterior shoulder pain."
CD009020,0,12486539,0,[Differential therapy for the rheumatoid shoulder].,"Despite frequent involvement, the rheumatoid shoulder is neglected in operative treatment of the upper extremities. The slow course of omarthritis, the compensation mechanism of scapulothoracic motion and neighbouring joints as well as dominating disabilities of the lower extremities and the rheumatoid hand are possible explanations. The pattern of destruction of the rheumatoid shoulder is characterized by progressive joint and soft tissue deterioration. Soft tissue involvement determines the course of the shoulder joint. The subacromial space is a common and early site for rheumatoid involvement, often leading to bursitis, tenosynovitis of the biceps tendon and rotator cuff rupture. Sonography and MRI enable the early detection of subacromial and glenohumeral pathology before deterioration is visible radiologically. Surgical intervention in patients with rheumatoid arthritis of the shoulder is based on the degree of radiological destruction according to Larsen, the natural course of the shoulder joint and the soft-tissue condition. The goals of surgery are to relieve pain, increase motion and restore shoulder function. Surgery should be carried out early in the course of the disease, thus determining the long-term prognosis and the remaining surgical options. Depending on the pattern of destruction of the rheumatoid shoulder, the options for treatment can be divided into early and late procedures.Joint-preserving surgery is indicated in the early stages of radiological destruction according to Larsen classification O-III, whereas the late stages of destruction (Larsen IV-V) require reconstructive surgery. The introduction of arthroscopic and semiarthroscopic techniques has improved the acceptance of early synovectomy for the rheumatoid shoulder, but there is still a place for open synovectomy in patients with extensive soft-tissue repair and bone-remodelling procedures. Arthroscopic and open synovectomy are supplementary and noncompetitive surgical procedures for the rheumatoid shoulder. With proceeding bone and soft-tissue destruction corresponding to Larsen stage IV and V, synovectomy is not successful and reconstructive surgery is necessary. Resection-interposition-arthroplasty (RAIP) remains a controversial alternative to arthroplasty in young patients with sufficient bone stock and a reconstructable rotator cuff. The success of cup-replacement will additionally restrict the indications for RAIP. RIAP remains a possible salvage procedure after aseptic and septic loosening of shoulder arthroplasty. Glenohumeral replacement arthroplasty has become the procedure of choice in reconstructive surgery of the shoulder. The severity of soft-tissue and bone destruction determines the choice of shoulder prosthesis. Current modular shoulder systems with increased numbers of humeral-head stem combinations are calculated to achieve a better adjustment of the soft-tissue tension and to optimize the adaptation between head geometry and the natural shape of the glenoid.The surrounding soft-tissue structure, especially the condition of the rotator cuff, is very important for the functional recovery after shoulder arthroplasty. We prefer a hemiarthroplasty of the rheumatoid shoulder joint to avoid critical glenoid fixation. Patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears and severe glenohumeral arthritis remain a difficult challenge in shoulder surgery and the ideal procedure has not yet been found.Pain relief and a modest increase in active motion are the main goals in operative treatment. Bipolar shoulder arthroplasty represents an adequate alternative to currently favoured hemiarthroplasty in patients with cuff-deficient shoulders."

CD009020,0,12469082,0,Acromial shapes and extension of rotator cuff tears: magnetic resonance imaging evaluation.,"Magnetic resonance imaging makes it possible to inspect the status of the rotator cuff and the shape of the acromion. To clarify the relationship between acromial shapes and rotator cuff tears, we evaluated magnetic resonance images obtained in 192 shoulders. We classified the acromial shapes into 3 types: type I (flat), type II (curved), and type III (hooked). Among a group of 91 shoulders with rotator cuff tears, 33 (36.3%) were type I, 22 (24.2%) type II, and 36 (39.6%) type III. The size of rotator cuff tears in type III acromions was significantly larger than in type I or II acromions. Comparison of the incidence of each acromial shape between groups of specimens with and without rotator cuff tears revealed no significant differences. We suggest that whereas acromial shapes have a bearing on the extent of rotator cuff tears, the correlation between rotator cuff tears and a type III acromion is not as strong as has been suggested in the literature."
CD009020,0,12469080,0,Intratendinous strain fields of the supraspinatus tendon: effect of a surgically created articular-surface rotator cuff tear.,"Articular-surface partial-thickness rotator cuff tears play a significant role in shoulder pathology, but the role of the articular-surface tissue is poorly understood. This investigation assessed the effect of an articular-surface partial-thickness rotator cuff tear on intratendinous strain fields. A magnetic resonance imaging-based technique quantified intratendinous strains in healthy cadaveric shoulders at 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees of glenohumeral abduction. A second set of magnetic resonance images was acquired after an articular-surface partial-thickness tear was created arthroscopically. Measures of strain were grouped into 3 tendon regions. A 3-factor analysis of variance assessed the effects of joint position, tendon region, and tendon tear. Intratendinous strains were influenced significantly by joint position, but few differences existed between tendon regions. The articular-surface partial-thickness tear increased intratendinous strain for all joint positions except 15 degrees. The results lend insight into the mechanical behavior of the normal and pathologic rotator cuff."

Of the remaining 18 shoulders, 16 shoulders had rotator cuff tears, one had shoulder instability, and one had dislocation of the long head of the biceps tendon. Both the subcoracoid and subscapularis bursae are located in the subcoracoid space. The subcoracoid bursa does not communicate with the subscapularis bursa, but occasionally communicates with the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa. On MR arthrography, contrast material in the subcoracoid bursa indicates a pathologic condition such as rotator cuff tear. Careful examination of the subcoracoid bursa on MR arthrography helps to achieve better assessment of the rotator cuff."

CD009020,0,12399886,0,[Technique and diagnostic value of musculoskelatal ultrasonography in rheumatology. Part 5: Ultrasonography of the shoulder].,"Shoulder-related symptoms are very common in rheumatic diseases. For the evaluation of the diagnosis as well as for therapy and prognosis, an anatomic assignment is essential. Clinical investigations alone are often not capable to do this. Ultrasonography is a method to delineate bony surfaces as well as the soft tissues around the shoulder joints statically and even dynamically. For the purpose of rheumatic diseases, ultrasound standard scans help to detect the lesions at the biceps tendon, the bursae, the rotator cuff, the humeral head as well as in the acromial and sternoclavicular joints. Considering the limitations of the method (obesity, frozen shoulder, no findings under bony structures) and knowing the pitfalls and errors of the method, ultrasonography is a reliable, quick and low cost method for the diagnosis of rheumatic shoulder joint pathology. Compared to computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography should be used as a screening method. The following standard scans are suggested for sonographic evaluation of the shoulder: 1) anterior transverse scan and 2) anterior longitudinal scan at the bicipal groove to detect synovitis and tenosynovitis, 3) anterior transverse scan at the coracoacromiale window in the neutral position, 4) at maximal external rotation and 5) at maximal internal rotation to evaluate the rotator cuff, bursitis, synovitis and erosions, 6) anterior longitudinal scan at 90 degrees to the coracoacomiale window at maximal internal rotation to describe these findings in an additional dimension, 7) anterior-lateral longitudinal scan at the anterior lateral acromion to tuberculum majus to evaluate the distal part of the supraspinatus muscle, 8) posterior transverse scan at the fossa infraspinata lateral under the spina scapulae, 9) axillary longitudinal scan to evaluate synovitis, synovial proliferation, erosions at the humeral head, lesions at the glenoidale labrum, 10) anterior transverse scan at the acromioclavicular joint and 11) anterior oblique scan at the sternoclavicular joint to detect synovitis, synovial proliferation, erosion, osteophytes."
CD009020,0,12395913,0,Changes in size of periarthritis calcifications in patients with painful shoulder treated with injectable disodium-clodronate.,"Calcific periarticular disease is characterized by the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals in many tendons and particularly in the rotator cuff tendons. Calcifications of any size may be accompanied by painful shoulder syndrome and tendon tears. Ecographic assessment of changes in the size of calcifications may be a marker of tissue changes in evolving shoulder periarthropathies. The aim of this study was to compare variations in pain and ultrasound dimensions in the calcifications in the tendons of the rotator cuff in patients treated with disodium-clodronate compared with those treated with paracetamol and nimesulide. In all groups, pain reduction occurred over a 6-month period, but was significantly greater in patients administered disodium-clodronate than in those administered nimesulide or paracetamol. A significant reduction in the size of calcifications was also observed in all three groups, but this reduction was more marked in the disodium-clodronate group."
CD009020,0,12379388,0,Rotator cuff alterations resulting from humeral head fractures.,"Most complex humeral head fractures are associated with a longitudinal tear of the rotator cuff. Reconstruction of this tear is frequently omitted from surgical reduction and fixation procedures. In 48 patients treated by surgery or by conservative means, we investigated the relationship between rotator cuff integrity and the functional results. The rotator cuff was assessed by ultrasonography, the functional results by the Constant Score. Common signs of rotator cuff alterations were partial or complete atrophy. In all patients affected, a longitudinal defect located at the rotator interval was detected. A classification of rotator cuff alterations resulting from humeral head fractures was introduced, yielding three categories: none, moderate, or severe. In three patients, sonographic results were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Rotator cuff alterations were often associated with displaced consolidation results. Furthermore, the integrity of the rotator cuff significantly correlated with the function achieved. The results support the need for a careful rotator cuff repair in order to optimise treatment results."
CD009020,0,12378176,0,Surgical management of the symptomatic os acromiale.,"Os acromiale is an uncommon cause of shoulder pain with symptoms often resulting from an unstable meso-acromion. The associated pain may be due to impingement from the unfused fragment, a concomitant rotator cuff tear, or gross motion at the os acromiale site. Currently, initial treatment includes physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and subacromial corticosteroid injections. Surgical intervention is reserved for patients who do not respond to nonoperative treatment. Treatment options include open fragment excision, open reduction and internal fixation, and arthroscopic decompression. Open fragment excision can lead to persistent deltoid dysfunction and should be reserved for small fragments or after failed internal fixation. Open reduction and internal fixation allows for both preservation of large fragments and anterior deltoid function. Internal fixation is technically difficult, has led to frequent nonunion rates and often requires hardware removal as a result of postoperative irritation. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression with complete or nearly complete resection of the unstable meso-acromion can be performed without the aforementioned complications. The surgical technique requires no special instrumentation and may be performed reproducibly by those familiar with arthroscopic techniques of the shoulder. Advantages include more rapid rehabilitation, better range of motion, and shorter surgical times. Satisfactory short-term results have shown this to be an effective treatment option for the unstable meso-acromion."
CD009020,0,12368799,0,Articular impingement in malunited fracture of the humeral head.,"We report on the case of a fracture of the humeral metaepiphysis, surgical neck, and greater tuberosity treated conservatively. Malunion of a fracture of the greater tuberosity developed an impingement on the glenoid surface, causing an articular locking in internal rotation that resolved with slight pressure and a painful ""click."" The impinging bone was removed arthroscopically. Its extreme posterior position required opening a second, novel portal close to the posterior edge of the acromion for instrument access. Complete removal of the impinging bone restored free internal rotation without signs of impingement on the glenoid surface. Passive motion was initiated immediately postoperatively, and active motion in a water pool was initiated after 2 weeks. After 1 year, the patient has no pain, has maintained complete range of motion, and experiences no limitations in daily or sports activities. The peculiar features of this case are the absence of soft tissue scar stiffness and deficiency of the rotator cuff, because malunion of the bone fragment to the posterior edge of the humeral head produced a mechanical block of internal rotation, and the arthroscopic treatment of the impingement through an atypical superoposterior portal, which has not been described in the literature before."
CD009020,0,12360013,0,Magnetic resonance imaging for supraspinatus muscle atrophy after cuff repair.,"Between 1998 to 2000, the shoulders of 17 patients with rotator cuff tears were examined using magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively, and 6 and 12 months after open surgical repair. To assess the course of the supraspinatus muscle atrophy, the easily reproducible magnetic resonance imaging parameters occupation ratio and tangent sign in the Y-shaped view of the supraspinous fossa were evaluated and compared with the clinical examination. Occupation ratio is a quantitative parameter that reflects the area ratio, expressed as a percentage of the supraspinatus muscle belly to the supraspinous fossa. The tangent sign is a qualitative parameter that represents a line connecting the coracoid process and the apex of the scapular spine. Occupation ratio and tangent sign are reliable diagnostic tools in magnetic resonance imaging assessment of supraspinatus muscle atrophy. The sensitivity of the magnetic resonance imaging parameter occupation ratio is 75% and the specificity is 85%. The imaging parameter tangent sign has a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 85%. There is a significant relationship between occupation ratio, tangent sign, and improvement of strength and mobility registered in the score of Constant and Murley 12 months after surgery."
CD009020,0,12235350,0,Special focus session. MR arthrography.,"Direct magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography with injection of saline solution or diluted gadolinium can be useful for evaluating certain pathologic conditions in the joints. It is most helpful for outlining labral-ligamentous abnormalities in the shoulder and distinguishing partial-thickness from full-thickness tears in the rotator cuff, demonstrating labral tears in the hip, showing partial- and full-thickness tears of the collateral ligament of the elbow and delineating bands in the elbow, identifying residual or recurrent tears in the knee following meniscectomy, increasing the certainty of perforations of the ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage in the wrist, correctly identifying ligament tears in the ankle and increasing the sensitivity for ankle impingement syndromes, assessing the stability of osteochondral lesions in the articular surface of joints, and delineating loose bodies in joints. Indirect MR arthrography with intravenous administration of diluted gadolinium may be performed when direct arthrography is inconvenient or not logistically feasible. Although indirect MR arthrography has some disadvantages vis-à-vis direct MR arthrography, it does not require fluoroscopic guidance or joint injection and it is superior to conventional MR imaging in delineating structures when there is minimal joint fluid. In addition, vascularized or inflamed tissue will enhance with this method. Indirect MR arthrography can be used to rule in or diagnose abnormalities and to exclude abnormalities."

CD009020,0,12202690,0,The impact of MR imaging in sports medicine.,"Sports medicine is one of the most rapidly growing subspecialties in orthopedics. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in sports medicine includes depiction of normal anatomy and pathologic conditions in almost every joint in the body, but the MR examinations most frequently requested are of the knee and shoulder. The reported high accuracy of MR imaging in the knee has resulted in MR imaging being preferred to diagnostic arthroscopy by most leading orthopedic surgeons. MR imaging is particularly helpful for sports medicine surgeons in evaluating menisci to determine if they are repairable, in posterolateral corner syndrome, and in evaluating the hyaline articular cartilage. In evaluating the shoulder, MR arthrography is becoming the preoperative imaging procedure of choice for many sports medicine surgeons. Shoulder MR imaging is particularly important in helping identify abnormalities that may mimic rotator cuff or labral abnormalities at clinical examination, thus preventing unnecessary surgery in some patients.

CD009020,0,12195247,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of painful shoulder arthroplasty.,"Specialized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 42 painful shoulder arthroplasties, 22 of which underwent subsequent revision surgery, allowing surgical confirmation of the pathology identified on MRI. One hemiarthroplasty was excluded because of motion artifact, leaving 21 studies (19 patients) to be correlated retrospectively to the surgical findings. At the time of revision surgery, there were full-thickness rotator cuff tears in 11 of 21 shoulders; MRI correctly predicted these in 10 of 11 shoulders. Full-thickness subscapularis tears were the most common finding (8/11 shoulders). Of the 21 shoulders, 10 did not have a rotator cuff tear, and MRI correctly predicted the absence of a tear in 8 of 10. MRI also correctly predicted glenoid cartilage wear in 8 of 9 shoulders. With limited pulse-sequence parameter modification, the data from this preliminary study suggest that MRI may be a useful technique with which to determine the integrity of the rotator cuff and residual cartilage and, thus, is potentially a tool in the management of painful shoulder arthroplasty."

Few data exist, however, describing deformation of the rotator cuff as an intact, functional unit. Our purpose was to determine regional variations of intratendinous rotator cuff strain over a range of clinically relevant joint positions. A novel, MRI-based technique was utilized to quantify intratendinous strains in cadaveric shoulder specimens at 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees of glenohumeral abduction in the scapular plane. The strain data were grouped into superior, middle, and inferior locations across the region where most rotator cuff tears occur clinically. A repeated measures ANOVA assessed the effects of joint position and tendon region on intratendinous strain. Few differences in intratendinous strain existed across tendon regions, but joint position had a pronounced effect. Specifically, intratendinous strain increased with increasing joint angle, and the 60 degrees strain was significantly greater than the 15 degrees strain across all tendon regions. These data suggest that joint position plays a larger role in rotator cuff mechanics than previously believed. Future studies will utilize this technique for quantifying intratendinous strain to assess the effects of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears."
CD009020,0,12151902,0,Review article: diagnostic ultrasonography: applications in orthopaedic surgery.,"Diagnostic ultrasonography of musculoskeletal diseases in the United States has been used most often for detection of rotator cuff tears or developmental dysplasia of the hip. Diagnostic ultrasonography also is useful in imaging the periarticular soft tissues about the knee, hip, ankle, occult pediatric fractures, muscle injury, bone healing, and foreign bodies. Recent technologic improvements have made this imaging modality increasingly more accurate while providing significant benefits over traditional modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging, particularly regarding cost, patient satisfaction, and ease of usage. Increasing use in the future of diagnostic ultrasonography for musculoskeletal conditions is likely as acceptance grows. This review focuses on recent, practical applications of diagnostic ultrasonography of the musculoskeletal system."

CD009020,0,12136330,0,Adhesive capsulitis: role of MR imaging in differential diagnosis.,"The purpose of this study was to describe and characterize the MR imaging findings in a group of patients who underwent surgery for adhesive capsulitis. Twenty-four MR imaging studies in 24 consecutive patients with clinical evidence of adhesive capsulitis were performed prior to arthroscopic capsulotomy. There were 17 women and 7 men with a mean age of 53.5 years. Images were scrutinised for changes in the synovium particularly in the rotator interval, around the biceps anchor and axillary pouch. Intravenous gadolinium was given routinely. We also examined a control group of 22 patients who underwent the same MR imaging protocol after referral for rotator cuff pathology. Soft tissue density showing variable enhancement after gadolinium administration was visible in the rotator interval in 22 of 24 studies on MR imaging. Seventeen patients showed soft tissue density partially encasing the biceps anchor. Ten patients showed thickening and gadolinium enhancement of the axillary pouch. Three patients from the study cohort had partial tears of the supraspinatus tendon. All the patients subsequently had surgery which confirmed fibrovascular scar tissue in the rotator interval, around the biceps anchor and a variable degree of synovial inflammation of the glenohumeral capsule. Two patients from a control group with suspected rotator cuff pathology showed abnormal intensity in the rotator interval on MR imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging can identify changes in the shoulder joint that correspond to abnormalities seen at surgery. This may be useful for discriminating adhesive capsulitis from other causes of shoulder pain."

After recent treatment of 3 patients treated in our clinic typical courses and pitfalls are demonstrated. Due to the traumatic genesis of subscapularis tendon ruptures, lesions of the rotator cuff must be excluded generally by an adequate diagnostic concept. Conventional x-rays of the shoulder in 2 views to exclude a bony lesion, clinical and ultrasound examination are seen as a standard because these methods will allow the correct diagnosis in most cases. Typical clinical signs for a subscapularis lesion are the ""lift-off-test"" and the ""napoleon sign."" The ultrasound examination should be done statically and dynamically by comparing the injured with the uninjured shoulder. The typical view in case of a subscapularis tendon rupture is a thinned tendon overlying the humeral head. In our opinion nuclear magnetic resonance imaging should not be the first diagnostic procedure. It should be reserved for such cases with unclear clinical and ultrasound results."

Routine clinical MRI sequences of 100 shoulders were reviewed, and standardized measurements of the subcoracoid space were taken and compared with previously published computed tomographic (CT) data. MRI and CT values were very similar. There were no significant differences between the coracoid morphology of patients with normal findings and patients with varying degrees of rotator cuff disease involving the supraspinatus tendon. The excellent agreement between MRI and CT measurements indicates that different investigators may use either imaging modality to obtain reproducible results.

Estimates of rotator cuff tear size were compared with the findings at open operation in 33 consecutive patients with a presumptive diagnosis of rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopy estimates of rotator cuff tear size correlated best with actual tear size (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.92; P <.001). Magnetic resonance imaging (r = 0.74; P <.001) was similar to ultrasonography (r = 0.73; P <.001). Estimates of rotator cuff tear size after clinical assessment alone had weaker correlation coefficients (r = 0.41; P =.02) than the other methods.

CD009020,0,12068399,0,Instability after arthroplasty: the shoulder.,"Shoulder instability after total shoulder arthroplasty may be classified as posterior, anterior, superior, or inferior. Basic causes include malposition of the components, incorrect version of the glenoid or humeral cuts, soft tissue contractures or laxity, and cuff deficiency. These may be present as isolated or as combined deficiencies. As always, avoidance is best, but instability is the commonest complication of shoulder arthroplasty and must be dealt with correctly. Recognition of the anatomic cause is crucial. Proper evaluation with radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging is crucial to the treatment algorithm. Normally the glenoid is nearly perpendicular to the scapular spine, whereas the humeral head is retroverted about 30 degrees with respect to the transepicondylar axis. After defining the anatomic problem, proper component positioning, elimination of contractures, plication of capsular laxity, and establishing cuff integrity ensure the best opportunity for a stable shoulder."
CD009020,0,12056171,0,Ultrasonographic findings in hemiplegic shoulders of stroke patients.,"Shoulder problems are frequently noted in hemiplegic shoulders and compromise rehabilitation. Many tools were used to evaluate the etiology of shoulder problems but most of them are either nonspecific to the evaluation of soft tissue or not convenient. In order to evaluate soft tissue and joint change in hemiplegic shoulders, 82 patients with hemiplegic shoulders caused by cerebral vascular accident (CVA) were collected and evaluated by ultrasonography with 5-12 MHz high-resolution electronic linear scanner (ATL ultrasound HDI 1500, USA). The non-hemiplegic shoulders were also studied as control group. The results showed that ultrasonographic changes were noted in 51 (62.2%) hemiplegic shoulders while changes only occurred in 17 (20.7%) non-hemiplegic shoulders. Effusion and tendinitis were the major changes showing statistical difference compared with non-hemiplegic shoulders, but there was no significant difference in the incidence of supraspinatus tendon tear between hemiplegic and non-hemiplegic shoulders. Further, the interval from the onset of CVA was not significantly correlated with the presence of positive ultrasonographic findings in hemiplegic shoulders. The results demonstrated that ultrasonography is a potential method in the evaluation of hemiplegic shoulder."

Clinical and sonographic study.,"A total of 39 patients with a mean age of 64 years (41 to 88) who had had anterior shoulder dislocation were followed-up an average of 2 years after trauma in order to evaluate the conditions of the rotator cuff. All of the patients were evaluated clinically, radiographically, and sonographically. Clinical evaluation revealed significant differences between the dislocated shoulders and the contralateral ones: the mean Constant score was 67 in the group with dislocated shoulders and 87 in the contralateral group. Ultrasound revealed partial injury of the cuff in 31% of cases and complete injury in 28%. Mean score was 81.4 in the group with a normal ultrasound, 67.1 in that with partial injury of the cuff, and 46.5 in that with complete injury of one or more tendons. These data confirm the high frequency of partial or complete injuries of the rotator cuff in patients aged over 40 years that have undergone anterior shoulder dislocation.

The results showed that there was normal tendinous integrity in 16 cases (group A), while there were partial injuries, without evidence of complete lesion, in 4 cases (group B); tendinous thinning was evident in 10 patients (50%), while there were areas of intratendinous degeneration in 40% of the cases. The authors observed agreement between the data obtained by the two methods in 75% of cases, and emphasize the effectiveness of the two methods in postoperative evaluation of the cuff; they also confirm the tendinous dishomogeneousness observed in the patients in group B, not associated with poor clinical results, considering the absence of significant differences in the functional results between the two groups."
CD009020,0,12017847,1,[Ultrasound diagnosis of the rotator cuff].,"Shoulder sonography is a well-established and standardized method to evaluate the status of the rotator cuff, the long head of the biceps, and the subacromial and subdeltoid bursae. Using high-frequency linear probes, the sensitivity in detecting total tears sized 0.5 cm and greater is > 90% and in detecting partial thickness tears of at least one-third of the cuff substance > 75% when using the dual-criteria standard. Ultrasound achieves comparable or better results than native magnetic resonance tomography at far less cost. False results can be excluded in the majority of cases by strict adherence to a dual-criteria model. The ability to display the joint's soft tissue structures in real time is unique up to now. The limits of sonography are (1) in the estimation of tear size in global tears as retraction of tendon stumps under the acromion cannot be visualized and (2) in the evaluation of status of rotator cuff muscles since volumetric information about atrophy can be gained by ultrasonography, but a differentiation between simple atrophy and fatty degeneration is not possible."

Surgical findings were used as the gold standard in detecting tears. A total of 44 patients were assessed with transverse and longitudinal US scans with respect to the long axis of the rotator cuff tendons and then examined with MR arthrography. This technique involved free-hand injection of contrast medium into the shoulder joint. At surgery 20 incomplete and 24 complete tears were observed. Ultrasound offered good results for the large tears, but its sensitivity decreased proportionally with the size of the tears. Magnetic resonance arthrography correctly diagnosed 43 tears, whereas only one false-negative diagnosis of tendinosis was made for a partial tear on the bursal side. Since it improves the diagnosis of small tears, MR arthrography must be performed on all patients for whom surgical repair is necessary in order to restore normal functions."

The cross-sectional area of the subscapularis, supraspinatus, the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles in the coronal oblique MR images were measured before and after surgery.

The dominant extremity was affected in all patients; the patients' average age was 26.9 years. Eighteen patients participated at the highest level of competition for their age, and the remaining patients participated at the intermediate level. Patients were evaluated at an average of 45.7 months after surgery by physical examination, an activities questionnaire, a subjective result questionnaire, and a questionnaire regarding their return to activity. Postoperatively, the patients averaged 26.9 of 30 possible points on the activities questionnaire. Twenty-three of the patients were subjectively satisfied with the surgical result. Twenty-two patients had returned to tennis. Despite their return, 20 of the 22 patients reported some persistent pain with participation. To our knowledge, this is the first report detailing the results of operative treatment for posterosuperior glenoid impingement in a population limited to tennis players. Even though the results are encouraging in terms of the high number of patients returning to tennis, the effects of this persistent pain with activity, although diminished in severity, on long-term participation is unknown."

Thirty-seven shoulders in 33 patients who had reoperation for a presumed failed rotator cuff repair were retrospectively evaluated. All patients had preoperative MRI, the results of which were read by a musculoskeletal radiologist to determine the presence of a tear and to estimate its size. All tears were measured intraoperatively in sagittal and coronal planes. Thirty-three shoulders had recurrent tears of the rotator cuff, and MRI correctly identified the presence of 30 of them. MRI correctly identified only 1 of the 4 patients without a recurrent tear of the cuff. The correlation coefficient for MRI accurately defining the size of cuff tears was 0.46. The sensitivity of MRI for the diagnosis of retear was 91%, and the specificity was 25%. MRI is accurate in diagnosing a recurrent full-thickness cuff tear in postsurgical shoulders.

Computer data based searches were used to identify articles regarding complications of shoulder arthroscopy, as well as hand searches of Arthroscopy and Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery over the last decade. Arthroscopic shoulder surgery has become a popular therapeutic and diagnostic procedure during the past two decades. As with all interventions complications can occur which require recognition and management by the orthopedic surgeon. While the literature is helpful with identifying types of complications, establishing the rate of these complications remains elusive. These complications can be divided into general complications, complications generic to all shoulder procedures, and complications specific to the type of procedure performed. General complications such as infection and anesthesia problems continue to show low incidences. Shoulder arthroscopy presents increased risk of complications over knee arthroscopy in regard to vascular and neurologic injury, fluid extravasation, stiffness, iatrogenic tendon injury, and equipment failure. New techniques of increased complexity for subacromial surgery, rotator cuff repair, and arthroscopic instability present new problems related to implant failure, nerve injury, iatrogenic fracture, and capsular necrosis. While the rate of complications especially with newer procedures remain elusive, most studies suggest that the rate is low, 5.8-9.5% in all recent review studies published. Underreporting complications makes assessment of incidence rates of complication difficult. Proper patient selection, attention to operative detail, and careful post-operative monitoring can minimize the morbidity associated with these complications."

CD009020,0,11798999,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder in asymptomatic professional baseball pitchers.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging findings in both shoulders of asymptomatic professional baseball pitchers. Fourteen pitchers who were without significant prior injury underwent a blinded clinical assessment and magnetic resonance imaging of both shoulders. All images were interpreted by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. The appearance of the rotator cuff tendons was graded, with additional evaluation of the biceps, labrum, and osseous structures. Ten athletes were found to have stable shoulders and painless full range of motion. Clinically, four athletes had at least a 40 degrees loss in internal rotation as compared with the nonthrowing arm. There were no significant differences in magnetic resonance imaging findings of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons between the throwing and nonthrowing shoulders. The labrum was abnormal in 79% of the 28 shoulders. Enthesopathic changes of the posterior glenoid labrum were identified in the four pitchers who had loss of internal rotation. We conclude that unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder in asymptomatic high performance throwing athletes reveals abnormalities that may encompass a spectrum of ""nonclinical"" findings. These data can be useful in separating symptomatic pathologic findings from these variants. Enthesopathic changes of the posterior glenoid labrum in the throwing arm may represent an early Bennett-type lesion. The cause may be excessive traction on the posterior capsule during the pitching motion, with subclinical injury to this area."

This retrospective study compared the MR results obtained in 47 patients that underwent MRI using a 0.2-Tesla extremity MR system (E-scan) to the surgical findings. MR images of the shoulder were obtained as follows: shoulder coil, T1-weighted, coronal-oblique and axial images; short Tau inversion recovery (STIR), coronal-oblique images; and T2-weighted, coronal-oblique, sagittal-oblique, and axial images. The MR examinations were interpreted by three highly experienced, musculoskeletal radiologists. Open surgical (N = 26) or arthroscopic (N = 21) procedures were performed within a mean time of 33 days after MRI. The surgical findings revealed rotator cuff tears in 28 patients and labral lesions in 9 patients. For the rotator cuff tears, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 89%, 100%, 100%, and 90%, respectively. For the labral lesions, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 89%, 95%, 80%, and 97%, respectively. The findings indicated that there was good agreement comparing the MR results obtained using the low-field extremity MR system to the surgical findings for determination of lesions of the rotator cuff and glenoid labrum. Notably, the statistical values determined for the use of this MR system were comparable to those reported in the peer-reviewed literature for the use of whole-body, mid- and high-field-strength MR systems."

There was a statistically significant difference in Constant score between groups, which measured 55% for the salvage group compared with 70% for the primary group (P <.05). Poor tendon quality, stage 4 muscle fatty degeneration, and detachment of the deltoid insertion each had a statistically significant effect on the Constant score (P <.05). Late rupture of the tendon transfer occurred in 44% of patients in the salvage group compared with 17% in the primary group at a mean of 19 months postoperatively. Rupture had a statistically significant effect on the Constant score, which declined by a mean of 14% (P <.05). We conclude that salvage reconstruction of failed prior rotator cuff repairs yields more limited gains in satisfaction and function than primary latissimus dorsi transfer."

Fifty-four of 60 shoulders (58 patients) examined by MRI were confirmed as full-thickness tears and 6 as partial-thickness tears at the time of surgery. The oblique coronal, oblique sagittal, and axial planes of T2-weighted images with the 0.5 tesla MRI system were obtained preoperatively and compared with operative findings. MRI correctly identified 46 of 54 full-thickness rotator cuff tears and 5 of 6 partial-thickness tears. A comparison of MRI and operative findings in full-thickness cuff tears showed a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 83%, and a positive prospective value (PPV) of 99%. A comparison of partial-thickness tears showed a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 85%, and PPV of 39%. Linear regression analysis showed an excellent correlation between the MRI assessment and measurement at the time of surgery (r = 0.90, P < 0.01). MRI was useful in evaluating large and medium-sized rotator cuff tears, but less useful in distinguishing small full-thickness tears from partial-thickness tears."

Using US and MR, we studied all painful shoulders seen during 1998 in our orthopaedic unit. Diagnosis was confirmed in 61 cases. The diagnosis of full thickness rotator cuff tear was highly specific on both imaging techniques (100% for US and 97.1% for MR) but was not as sensitive on US (57.7%) as on MR (80.8%). The diagnosis of partial tear was acceptably specific (67.9% for US and 75.5% for MR) but was not sensitive (overall, 12.5% for US vs 50% for MR). The specificity of a US diagnosis of a tear allows us to recommend surgery, thus making it a good imaging technique for the initial study of painful shoulders. The low sensitivity makes it necessary to undertake an additional MR study. If the MR also discovers no pathology, the sensitivity based on the US and MR images (92.7%) can be sufficient to avoid a false-negative diagnosis."

The purpose of this study was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plain radiographs, questionnaires, and physical examination to gain insight into the prevalence of shoulder disorders in individuals with PP. A total of 28 individuals with PP was recruited (mean age=35; mean year from injury=11.5). Each subject completed a questionnaire designed to identify arm pain, had a standard physical examination focusing on the shoulder, and underwent imaging studies (radiographic and MRI). Nine of the thirty-two subjects (36 percent) experienced shoulder pain in the month prior to testing. The MRI studies documented only one rotator cuff tear. Five subjects showed osteolysis of the distal clavicle by plain radiographic study. In two subjects this was seen bilaterally. Although no relationship was seen between pain and imaging abnormalities, stepwise linear regressions found a statistically significant positive relationship between imaging abnormalities and body mass index (BMI) (radiographic: beta= 0.56, p<0.01; MRI: beta=0.52, p<0.01). This study found a low prevalence of rotator cuff tears and a high prevalence of distal clavicle osteolysis in a sample of relatively young individuals with PP.

CD009020,0,11513161,0,"Shoulder MRI refinements: differentiation of rotator cuff tear from artifacts and tendonosis, and reassessment of normal findings.","One of the difficulties with rotator cuff imaging lies in the normal variability of the tendon's signal. There may be intermediate signal present within the tendon because of magic-angle phenomenon, muscle and tendon fiber interdigitation, or tendinopathy related to degenerative changes or overuse injury. Partial and complete rotator cuff tears should be distinguishable from these causes of intermediate signal if water signal is reliably identified. This article reviews the important issue of distinguishing between rotator cuff tear and other causes of high signal in the rotator cuff, including artifacts and tendonosis. We include a review of the literature and a brief report of a study we conducted on 20 shoulders of 14 asymptomatic, young volunteers. In this study, the rotator cuff tendons were evaluated for abnormal signal at different TE values to determine at what TE the interpreters were able to confidently distinguish the high-signal intensity of a tear (water) from the intermediate signal intensity associated with artifact and tendinopathy. Readers were able to distinguish water and tendon signal in 70% to 100% of fast-spin echo (FSE) fat-saturated images with TE of 66, but there was interobserver variability at this TE, suggesting that it is less reliable than 88 ms in the identification of rotator cuff tears. By using FSE fat-saturated sequences with TE of 88 and fast spin echo inversion recovery (FSEIR) sequences, readers at all levels of experience were able to differentiate water signal intensity from tendon signal intensity in 100% of cases. Therefore, we suggest that either FSEIR images or FSE fat-saturated images with TE greater than 66 be used to facilitate the differentiation of fluid signal from intermediate increased signal intensity in rotator cuff imaging. Additionally, this article reviews the normal findings of shoulder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as revealed by the asymptomatic subjects included in our study, and assesses these findings in respect to previous publications. The normal features reviewed include the subacromion-subdeltoid (SA/SD) bursa, the biceps tendon sheath, the acromioclavicular (AC) joint, and the greater tuberosity of the humerus. A small amount of fluid was commonly seen in the SA/SD bursa, as well as the biceps tendon sheath. Subjective down-sloping of the acromion in the coronal plane, mild degenerative change of the AC joint, and undersurface spurring of the AC joint were uncommon in our normal subjects. Cystic change limited to the posterior aspect of the greater tuberosity was identified in 15% to 45% of shoulders."

The available radiological methods are MRI, CT and MR arthrography. Twelve athletes suffering from shoulder pain or instability have been studied and then underwent successful treatment in arthroscopy. On the basis of our results and experience, we think that MR, especially with intra-articular injection of contrast medium, is the best examination because it offers an accurate evaluation of both rotator cuff and glenoid labrum.

CD009020,0,11450127,0,[Shoulder instability: diagnostic imaging].,"Shoulder instability is often diagnosed among athletes; two clinical forms are distinguished: anatomical instability, with recurrent luxation of the shoulder, and functional instability, with pain, articular ""click"" and sensation of instability. Lesions of periarticular soft tissues (capsula, fibrocartilaginous labrum, gleno-humeral ligaments and rotator cuff) are common in both forms, while lesions of bone structures (humeral head and glenoid of scapula) are typical of shoulder with previous dislocation. Purpose of our retrospective study was to verify the value of magnetic resonance (MRI) and computed arthrography (arthro-CT) in diagnosing these lesions in 57 patients suffering from shoulder instability. On the basis of our results and experience we think that in a preoperative evaluation of an unstable shoulder, arthro-CT and arthro-MRI are more accurate because the intra-articular injection of a contrast medium better identifies lesions of capsula, gleno-humeral ligaments and fibrocartilaginous labrum. In other circumstances, such as the study of the shoulder for legal purposes, MRI is preferable because it offers an accurate and global evaluation of periarticular structures."

Twenty-one elite javelin throwers were examined at an average of 19 years after the end of their high performance phase. Mean age at examination was 50 years. Functional assessment of both shoulders was determined by the Constant-score. The shoulder of the throwing arm was examined by magnetic resonance imaging. Both elbow joints were examined clinically and radiographically. Five athletes complained about transient shoulder pain in their throwing arm affecting activities of daily living, fourteen athletes had a deficit of internal rotation of at least ten degrees. Constant-scores of throwing arms were six points lower than those of non-throwing arms (P < 0.05). Complete ruptures and partial tears of the rotator cuff were frequent. Three athletes complained about transient elbow pain in their throwing arm affecting activities of daily living; ten athletes had a deficit of extension of more than five degrees. All dominant elbows had advanced arthrotic alterations (osteophytes, sclerosis) compared to the non-dominant side. Athletes who trained with weights of more than 3 kg had a significantly higher risk of degenerative changes than athletes who did not (P < 0.01). We therefore recommend to avoid throwing training with weights of more than 3 kg."

Since 1985 through the present, bilateral sonograms were done on all patients. A review of consecutive sonograms done from 1989 to 1994 revealed 58 potential patients with unilateral symptoms who had contralateral asymptomatic rotator cuff tears. Of these 58 patients, 45 (22 men, 23 women) responded to a comprehensive questionnaire and 23 additionally returned for examination and repeat sonographic evaluation. The questionnaire was based on the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score and included several outcome-based questions. A physical examination was performed in a standardized fashion along American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons guidelines. Repeat high-resolution sonograms were performed by a single experienced radiologist. Primary and repeat sonograms were then reassessed for tear size and location by two independent experienced radiologists blinded to the clinical data results. Twenty-three (51%) of the previously asymptomatic patients became symptomatic over a mean of 2.8 years. The average Activities of Daily Living score for those remaining asymptomatic was 28.5 of 30 and for those becoming newly symptomatic, 22.9 of 30 (P <.5). The mean visual analog pain score (1 = no pain) for those remaining asymptomatic was 1.1 and for the newly symptomatic patients, 4.0. Of the 23 patients who returned for ultrasound, 9 were asymptomatic and 14 symptomatic. Only 2 of the 9 patients remaining asymptomatic had progression of their tears. Overall, 9 of 23 patients had tear progression. No patient had a decrease in the size of the tear. Our results demonstrate that symptoms can develop in patients with previously asymptomatic rotator cuff tears when seen in the context of a contralateral symptomatic tear. Development of symptoms was associated with a significant increase in pain and decrease in the ability to perform activities of daily living (P <.05). There appears to be a risk for tear size progression over time."

However, these are important distinctions for orthopedic surgeons who are deciding whether to operate and what type of surgery to perform on a patient with suspect rotator cuff pathology. Gadolinium magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) involves injecting dilute gadolinium into the shoulder under fluoroscopy. Subsequent multiplanar T1-weighted fat-suppressed fast spin echo combined with T2-weighted fast spin echo and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) produces images that can accurately differentiate absence of tear from partial-thickness tear and from small, full-thickness tear; as a fringe benefit, this combination of sequences can identify the inflammation associated with tendonitis. Furthermore, the technique differentiates articular from bursal surface partial-thickness tears, and it accurately quantitates the size of full-thickness tears to help surgeons choose between arthroscopic versus open surgery."
CD009020,0,11387103,0,Sonography of the Shoulder.,"A great amount of work in musculoskeletal sonography has focused on evaluation of the shoulder and rotator cuff. This is primarily due to the fact that the shoulder is a common site of symptomatology and clinical evaluation is difficult. Even though sonography of the rotator cuff is more difficult than other large tendons, there has been constant incentive to develop and refine shoulder sonography. In the past five years there have been dramatic improvements in high resolution transducers, as well as advances in our understanding of the technique of shoulder sonography and more widespread agreement of the findings seen with rotator cuff tears. All of these factors have contributed to making the exam easier to perform and interpret than in the past.

A qualified examinator with excellent knowledge of the anatomy and the current diseases and injuries, and an adequate apparative condition as well, is of eminent importance. In comparison with MRI the advantage of the sonography is a higher resolution, the possibility of dynamic examination and an easy comparison with the opposite side. Availability is better and the price is lower. A disadvantage is the impossibility to judge the subacromial space and parts of the glenoid rim. Furthermore the skill of the sonographer limits the evidence of the examination. Sonographic examination should belong, together with the conventional x-ray to the first imaging procedures in shoulder diagnostics."

Length and width of the labrum were measured. One hundred twenty-one of 241 (50%) arthroscopically normal labral parts demonstrated normal (low) signal intensity and normal form on MR arthrograms. Increased linear or globular signal intensity was present in 74 of 241 (31%) normal labral parts, deformed or fragmented labra in 28 (12%), complete separation of the labrum from the glenoid in 4 (2%), a cleft in 5 (2%), attenuation in 4 (2%), and complete absence in 5 (2%), respectively. The mean size of the normal labrum varied between 3.8 x 3.3 mm at the subscapularis bursa level (anteriorly) and 6.1 x 5.6 mm at the inferior portion of the glenoid (anteriorly). The size was not significantly different between arthroscopically normal and abnormal labral parts (p = 0.13-0.83). Since the MR appearance of the arthroscopically normal glenoid labrum varies considerably concerning signal intensity, form, and size, only major tears or detachments of the labrum should be diagnosed."

Arthro-CT or arthro-MRI need not be in all cases but can provide additional information performed about the intraarticular structures and the glenoid labrum. The rotator cuff is initially evaluated by plain films which demonstrate anatomical conditions resulting in impingement syndrome as well as indirect signs of tendinopathy. Direct visualization of tendons may be achieved by US, arthro-CT, arthro-MRI. US is a dynamic, non invasive and accurate technique for evaluation of rotator cuff tear but is very operator-dependent. Arthro-CT is more reproductive and reveals accurately partial tear as well as anterior tears involving biceps or subscapularis tendons.

Physical examination was positive for a load and shift (fulcrum) testing of the middle glenohumeral ligament and ""Whipple"" testing of the anterior supraspinatus tendon. Magnetic resonance imaging with or without gadolinium was positive for anterior labral tearing in all 20 patients in which the test was performed. RESULTS: Arthroscopic repair of the detached labrum resulted in decreased pain and improved function in all patients. Thirty-one of the patients were well satisfied, 1 was improved, and 1 was dissatisfied with the repair. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-one of 33 patients graded as excellent, 1 good, and 1 poor in this study. Surgical repair of avulsions of the middle glenohumeral ligament provides satisfactory results in a majority of patients."
CD009020,0,11234944,1,Diagnostic capabilities of shoulder ultrasonography in the detection of complete and partial rotator cuff tears.,"Our study assessed the accuracy of shoulder ultrasonography in detecting complete and partial rotator cuff tears. We performed a prospective study in 24 patients scheduled for shoulder arthroscopy for impingement, partial-thickness or full-thickness (complete) rotator cuff tears, adhesive capsulitis, or arthritis. Before surgery, all patients underwent diagnostic shoulder ultrasonography followed by a shoulder arthroscopy with examination of the rotator cuff. The arthroscopic findings of rotator cuff integrity were compared with the diagnoses made from ultrasonography. The ultrasonographer was not blinded to the history and examination findings, and the surgeon was not blinded to the results of the ultrasonography. Ultrasound had sensitivity and specificity rates of 80% and 100%, respectively (positive and negative predictive rates of 100% and 88%), in the diagnosis of full-thickness rotator cuff tears and sensitivity and specificity rates of 71% and 100%, respectively (positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 88%), for partial-thickness tears. Although the potential for bias exists in this study, the results suggest that diagnostic ultrasound is effective in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears."

Twenty-four patients with clinically suspected rotator cuff disease were examined. Conventional MR images and post-contrast indirect MR arthrography images were obtained. All images were evaluated in a blinded fashion by two musculoskeletal radiologist. Results were than analyzed depending on surgical output. The correlation coefficient (Spearman rank correlation test) and the kappa values for agreement between surgery and imaging techniques were calculated. The correlation coefficients between indirect MR arthrography and surgery for reader 1 and reader 2 were 0.9137 and 0.9773, respectively. Whereas the agreement between conventional MR imaging and surgery was moderate (n = 0.383-0.571), the agreement between indirect MR arthrography and surgery was excellent (n = 0.873-0.936). We suggest the use of indirect MR arthrography technique when conventional MR images are equivocal in diagnosis of rotator cuff disease."

The aim of this study was to define the relative value of these methods. Clinical and MRI diagnoses of 88 shoulders were compared with the intraoperative findings. The correct diagnosis of a posterosuperior rotator cuff rupture was made in 79% of the cases by clinical examination and in 91% of the cases by MRI. For the subscapularis tendon clinical examination corresponded to the intraoperative findings in 73% of the cases versus 59% for MRI. MRI was superior to clinical examination in diagnosing a posterosuperior rotator cuff rupture. For the evaluation of ruptures of the subscapularis tendon, clinical examination was more reliable than MRI. Diagnosis of rotator cuff rupture can most often be obtained by a simple physical examination."
CD009020,0,11199405,0,[Diagnosis and therapeutic management following traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation according to extrinsic prognostic factors].,"We examined the importance of preoperative CT- and NMR-imaging concerning the detection of a bankart-lesion by a retrospective evaluation of 36 patients with primary traumatic or posttraumatic recurrent shoulder dislocations. Because of unfavourable extrinsic prognostic factors, we advised shoulder arthroscopy and surgical stabilization in all cases. Intraoperatively 35 of 36 patients (97%) presented a bankart-lesion. Preoperatively a bankart-lesion was detected in 32 cases (91%) by CT (n = 29) or NMR (n = 7). We could predict the probability of a bankart-lesion with a high reliability by clinical evaluation alone due to several risk-factors. All patients had at least 2 unfavourable prognostic factors. Under these circumstances we could assume a bankart-lesion with a probability of 97%. Therefore in our opinion preoperative CT or NMR is not advised as standard diagnostic procedure in patients with high-risk of recurrence according to extrinsic prognostic factors. We recommend preoperative CT or NMR when the estimation of prognostic factors concerning the risk of redislocation is doubtful and in case of difficult clinical and ultrasound examination regarding shoulder laxity or rotator cuff lesions."
CD009020,0,11195119,0,Surgical or conservative treatment for chronic rotator cuff calcifying tendinitis--a matched-pair analysis of 100 patients.,"Conservative or operative treatment for rotator cuff calcifying tendinitis was investigated in 100 patients in a matched-pair analysis. They were examined clinically and ultrasonographically 35-60 months after the initial visit. The mean Patte score was 91.8 for the patients who underwent surgical treatment and 81 for the ones who received conservative therapy (p < 0.004), while the age-related Constant-score was 103.4 and 95, respectively. Ultrasonography showed 28% calcifications in the surgical group, 18% newly formed and 10% that did not resolve after surgery. In the conservatively treated group, 33% calcifications were seen, of which 67% resolved. The number of rotator cuff ruptures was significantly higher in the conservative group. In the surgical group, 2% of partial tears and in the conservative group 5% of partial and 4% of complete cuff ruptures were found. Conservative treatment for calcifying tendinitis leads to less favourable pain results in the long term than surgical treatment. Surgery shortens the painful period and may reduce the number of future rotator cuff ruptures. Finally, the subjective functional outcome is significantly better after surgery."
CD009020,0,11182734,0,Diagnosis and treatment of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears.,"Nineteen of 407 patients who underwent rotator cuff repair surgery over a 6-year period were found to have a tear of the subscapularis in combination with the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons. Nine of these patients had an unsuccessful prior surgery, which failed to recognize the extent of the subscapularis component. Surgical repair of the subscapularis tendon required a deltopectoral approach, and repair of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus components of the tear could only be accomplished through this approach in 4 patients. In the remaining 15, an extended superior approach was required to mobilize and repair the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons. In all cases, the biceps tendon was either torn or severely degenerated, requiring tenodesis. At a mean follow-up of 40 months (range 24 to 75 months), subjective results were excellent in 5 patients, good in 3, fair in 4, and poor in 7. The modified Constant score improved to a mean of 69% (range 23% to 130%), compared with a preoperative mean of 38% (range 23% to 100%). Physical findings positive for subscapularis insufficiency persisted in 14 of 19 patients. A significant correlation (P <.05) was found between a lower Constant score and duration of symptoms longer than 6 months as well as an appearance of severe fatty degeneration and atrophy of the subscapularis muscle on magnetic resonance imaging. We conclude that anterosuperior rotator cuff tears are an infrequent configuration that may require surgical repair through an extended approach combining deltopectoral mobilization of the subscapularis with transdeltoid mobilization of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Repair before 6 months of symptoms is associated with a better functional outcome and is the result of less involution of muscle and tendon tissue."

CD009020,0,11155300,0,Impingement of the deep surface of the subscapularis tendon and the reflection pulley on the anterosuperior glenoid rim: a preliminary report.,"Sixteen patients underwent detailed arthroscopic evaluation; all had moderate to severe, primarily unexplained shoulder pain provoked by anterior elevation and internal rotation, and all were nonresponsive to subacromial injection of local anesthetic. None of the patients had any symptoms or signs of instability. Partial subscapularis lesions were documented in 10 of 13 patients who had undergone preoperative arthro-magnetic resonance imaging. At arthroscopy, an isolated lesion of the common humeral insertion of the superior glenohumeral and coracohumeral ligaments (a so-called pulley lesion) was found in 3 cases, a lesion associating a pulley and an articular side partial subscapularis lesion in 10 cases, and an isolated articular side partial subscapularis tear in 3 cases. The most painful movement, which consisted of flexion and internal rotation, caused impingement of the involved ligamentous and/or capsular insertions in all patients. If the arm was elevated above 90 degrees, the zone of mechanical contact was between the long head of the biceps and the pulley region and superiormost aspect of the labrum; if elevation was decreased, impingement occurred between the tendinous insertion of the subscapularis and the anterior glenoid labrum and rim. This study suggests that in addition to the posterosuperior impingement of the supraspinatus tendon originally described by Walch, anterosuperior impingement of the deep surface of the subscapularis is a form of intraarticular impingement responsible for painful structural disease of the shoulder."

We report an anatomic variant of SGHL attachment to the upper pole of the glenoid that has not heretofore been reported in the literature. In this case, the SGHL overrode the biceps origin, continued to the superior labrum posteriorly, and had no attachment to the middle glenohumeral ligament or the anterior labrum. This variant was detected during routine arthroscopic examination undertaken before surgery on a rotator cuff tear."
CD009020,0,11154011,0,Outcome of nonoperative management of full-thickness rotator cuff tears.,"The study documented the functional outcome in a consecutive series of 46 patients from an individual practice meeting the inclusion criteria of (1) a full-thickness rotator cuff tear seen by ultrasonography, arthrogram, or magnetic resonance imaging, (2) absence of a Workers' Compensation claim or previous surgery, (3) followup of at least 1 year, and (4) election of nonoperative management by the patient. Twenty-six of the tears involved only the supraspinatus, two involved the supraspinatus and infraspinatus, and two involved the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis (16 reports did not specify the size of the tear). Treatment consisted only of patient education and a home program of gentle stretching and strengthening. Patients completed the Simple Shoulder Test at the initial visit and sequentially at 6-month intervals thereafter. At an average followup of 2.5+/-1.6 years, 27 (59%) patients experienced improvement with nonoperative treatment, 14 (30%) patients experienced worsening, and five (11%) patients remained unchanged. The average number of Simple Shoulder Test functions the patients could perform initially was 5.6+/-3.2. At the latest followup, the average number of Simple Shoulder Test functions the patients could perform improved to 7.0 +/-3.8.

CD009020,0,11142911,0,[Superior labrum pathology in the athlete].,"Since their first description several years ago, superior glenoid labral lesions have increasingly been blamed for shoulder problems associated with sports. Originally merely describing arthroscopically visible upper labral/biceps abnormalities, the current understanding is that often clinical problems such as impingement pain or even rotator cuff disease can be secondary to these lesions, especially in overhead athletes. Impingement in these cases is caused by superior shoulder instability originating from an unstable biceps insertion that is present for example in SLAP (superior labrum from anterior to posterior) lesions. Additional problems such as internal or posterosuperior impingement that are often found simultaneously in these patients are pathomorphologically located in the same anatomical region and therefore make exact diagnosis and thus treatment more complex. Magnetic resonance imaging with intra-articular contrast enhancement and particularly arthroscopy are the primary tools for exact diagnosis and classification of superior labral/biceps pathology. Therapeutically, lesions with unstable biceps origin (SLAP types 2 and 4) require operative refixation, as we have seen in our 50 cases in the last 4 years, in order to reestablish the stabilising effect of the biceps tendon for the shoulder joint. The arthroscopic technique for repair of these lesions using different devices of implantable suture anchors is presented. Long-term pain-free shoulder function in competitive athletes, throwers in particular, thus requires anatomical reconstruction of the originally unstable biceps, which is the causal therapy for these lesions."

CD009020,0,11142906,0,[Shoulder impingement].,"The impingement syndrome is a common disorder of the shoulder girdle. The causes for this syndrome may be anatomic changes in the coracoacromial arch, also within the ultrastructural regions, on the one hand, or changes in the biomechanics which have developed for various reasons, on the other. Diagnosis is based on roentgenograms using the appropriate technique. In large-scale-studies, sonography has proved to be an extremely sensitive screening method for differential diagnosis of rupture of the rotator cuff. Magnetic resonance imaging might gain in value in the diagnosis of impingement as regards differential diagnosis of rupture of the rotator cuff because this technique--when employed appropriately--allows exact viewing of the soft tissue and the anterior part of the acromion. In the majority of cases conservative treatment is the method of choice. Methods of treatment are sonography, galvanization, and application of heat. Physiotherapy should not be initiated until pain relief has been achieved by other measures. Infiltration therapy is of considerable value in the management of pain due to impingement. Application of cortisone into the subacromial space must also be considered critically. As regards conservative therapy, only few evidence-based publications provide information on the effectiveness of different treatment regimens. Surgical therapy is only indicated in cases of pain resistant to the conservative therapy for a certain period. Furthermore, only an outlet impingement can be treated successfully by surgical decompression. The surgeon decides on the surgical method--open surgery or arthroscopy. Of course, arthroscopic methods are less invasive; however, up to now the superiority of one of the surgical methods over the other could not yet be proven by mid-term clinical results. Other surgical methods such as wedge osteotomy in the region of the spina scapulae are still in the experimental stage. By surgical and conservatives methods, good and even excellent results can be achieved in about 80% of the cases. The question remains as to why 20% of the patients show unsatisfactory results. One explanation might be that factors such as pathologic changes of the muscular balance and an altered microstructure of the tendons of the rotator cuff are rarely taken into consideration and Neer's concept of decompression is overestimated. Further research will be required in the field of biomechanics but clinical research on treatment concepts should also be undertaken to develop more differentiated strategies of treatment."

In all cases the rotator cuff was examined intraoperatively. A tear of the rotator cuff was documented in 4 cases (5%). The prevalence of rotator cuff tears in elderly patients with dislocated humeral head fractures is significantly smaller than expected referring to magnetic resonance-, sonographic and cadaveric studies of same-age patients without fracture.

CD009020,0,11065265,0,Sonographic features of dialysis-related amyloidosis of the shoulder.,"This study evaluated the diagnostic role of ultrasonography in dialysis-related amyloidosis in shoulders of chronically hemodialyzed patients. Fourteen shoulders of 12 long-term hemodialysis patients were examined. All patients had been on dialysis for at least 10 years. All patients had varying degrees of pain and limitations of movement in the studied shoulders. Dialysis-related amyloidosis was the presumed diagnosis in all patients. Any patient with a history of any disease, other than dialysis-related amyloidosis, capable of producing a pathologic shoulder condition was excluded. The following parameters were studied: supraspinatus and biceps tendon thickness, tendon tears, synovial thickening, and the presence of hypoechoic material around tendons and within bursae. All shoulders had a nonhomogeneous thickening, greater than 7 mm, of the supraspinatus tendon. Seven shoulders (50%) had abnormal thickening of the biceps tendon (4 mm or greater), and two shoulders had abnormal thickening of the subscapularis tendon. Hypoechoic deposits were seen in the subdeltoid bursae and biceps sheaths in five and six shoulders, respectively. Three shoulders showed partial tears of the supraspinatus tendon, one shoulder showed a tear in the biceps tendon, and one shoulder had a tear in the subscapularis tendon. Ultrasonography is an excellent imaging modality in diagnosing the presence of dialysis-related amyloidosis in symptomatic shoulders of long-term hemodialysis patients, without having to resort to invasive procedures. The results of previous studies have been confirmed and new ultrasonographic findings described. Of particular interest is the involvement of the subscapularis tendon in dialysis-related amyloidosis. Repeat ultrasonography can become an important way to follow-up progression of shoulder dialysis-related amyloidosis in hemodialyzed patients."

CD009020,0,11046178,0,Nonseptic monoarthritis: imaging features with clinical and histopathologic correlation.,"Diagnosis of septic arthritis requires aspiration and analysis of joint fluid. However, nonseptic articular disorders are fairly common and represent a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Such disorders include gout, Milwaukee shoulder, rapidly destructive articular disease, amyloid arthropathy, hemophilic arthropathy, primary synovial osteochondromatosis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, neuropathic arthropathy, and foreign-body synovitis. The clinical signs of articular disease, which include pain, swelling, and limitation of motion, are often nonspecific and can overlap with those of osseous or extraarticular disorders. Many articular processes have characteristic radiologic appearances that allow definitive diagnosis. Radiography is an important part of the evaluation of patients with articular disease. However, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the method of choice for characterizing the various disorders and assessing the full extent of osseous, chondral, and soft-tissue involvement. MR imaging can exquisitely demonstrate joint effusions, synovial proliferation, articular cartilage abnormalities, subchondral bone, ligaments, muscles, and juxtaarticular soft tissues. Although a wide spectrum of noninfectious processes may involve the joints, careful analysis of the imaging findings and correlation of these findings with the patient's clinical history can suggest a more specific diagnosis in most cases. Awareness and understanding of the underlying histopathologic findings aids in interpretation of MR images."

A superior sublabral recess is located at the 12 o'clock position and represents a normal recess between the superior labrum and the cartilage of the glenoid cavity. A sublabral foramen is located at the 2 o'clock position and represents localized detachment of the labrum from the glenoid rim. Buford complex is characterized by absence of the anterosuperior labrum and cordlike thickening of the middle glenohumeral ligament. Imaging features of damage to the anterior labrum include absence or detachment of the labrum and an irregular frayed appearance. Superior labrum anterior-to-posterior (SLAP) lesions are classified as type I (tear confined to the superior labrum), type II (labrum and biceps tendon detached from the superior glenoid), type III (bucket handle tear of the superior labrum), or type IV (bucket handle tear of the superior labrum with lateral extension into the biceps tendon). Increased distance between the labrum and the glenoid, an irregular appearance of the labral margin, or lateral extension of the separation may suggest a SLAP lesion rather than a normal anatomic variant. However, differentiation between normal variants and pathologic conditions and between various types of SLAP lesions remains difficult."

It is now thought that functional instability in the shoulder may lead to a vicious cycle involving microtraumata and attenuation of the capsular complex, and may eventually lead to shoulder pain. Changes in shoulder proprioception, measured by testing kinaesthetic sense and position sense, can be related to different pathologic changes in the shoulder, and sensory motor control may be an important factor for functional stability in the shoulder. MRI and arthroscopical findings in athletes with shoulder pain are changes in the glenoid labrum, the humeral head, the rotator cuff, biceps tendon and the capsular complex. However, these findings often present other clinical entities than impingement and are not always associated with instability. Clinically, there are tests that can objectively distinguish some of the pathological findings. However, we need more exact methods to further improve our clinical diagnoses of the painful shoulder. One of the keys could be an extended knowledge about the pathophysiology behind functional instability. This review focuses on an improved terminology in impingement based on the current knowledge of impingement and instability in the shoulder."

CD009020,0,10994687,0,Ultrasonography of the shoulder.,"Musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) is an important modality in evaluating shoulder disease. Following a baseline shoulder conventional radiographic examination, MSUS can be used to screen the painful shoulder. It is accurate in diagnosing full- and partial-thickness tears of the rotator cuff. Both types of tears can be further characterized by size, location, and extension. Postoperatively, the rotator cuff can also be evaluated for recurrent full-thickness tears. MSUS is the only modality that can visualize and characterize synovial disease, without radiographic contrast, and when necessary, US-guided aspiration and biopsy can be performed. Real-time scanning shows the actual motion of the shoulder and its parts. Multiple attempts can be made to achieve optimal images for accurate documentation. Accessibility to MSUS facilitates the rapid turnaround of patients. US imagers and bone radiologists would do well to use MSUS to help their referring physicians establish a quick and accurate diagnosis of shoulder disorders. This article presents a comprehensive, pictorial review of the technical aspects of shoulder sonography as well as major types of pathology that can be diagnosed with US."

MR imaging enables the detection or exclusion of degenerative and posttraumatic diseases of the shoulder with a reasonable accuracy. MR arthrography is useful in the visualization of subtle anatomic details and further improves the differentiation.

CD009020,0,10963917,0,Imaging of degenerative and posttraumatic disease in the shoulder joint with ultrasound.,"This article reviews the examination technique of shoulder ultrasound, normal and abnormal ultrasound findings in acute (posttraumatic) and chronic (degenerative) lesions. Moreover, it reviews the effectiveness of ultrasound in relation to magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Most authors report that full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus can reliably be diagnosed by ultrasound. However, the simple diagnosis of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear is no longer sufficient for surgical management. The precise localization and size of rotator cuff tears as well as the extent of muscle degeneration is important for surgical planning. For this aspect and for partial-thickness tears of the supraspinatus, for subscapularis lesions as well as for lesions of the long biceps tendons there is no consensus regarding the diagnostic value of ultrasound. To the present, ultrasound (contrary to MR imaging) has failed to demonstrate that it consistently influences the clinician's degree of confidence in the clinical diagnosis or the treatment plan. Therefore, some orthopedic surgeons prefer MR imaging to ultrasound in the evaluation of rotator cuff tears and other abnormalities of the glenohumeral joint. Moreover, MR imaging, especially when combined with arthrography, represents a one-step investigation, which not only allows for assessment of rotator cuff lesion but also of lesions of the labrum (Bankart lesions, SLAP lesions), the joint capsule and the biceps tendon. It also demonstrates muscle atrophy, which represents an important predictor of surgical outcome in rotator cuff repair."

Rupture of the long head of the biceps tendon.,"Rupture of the long head of the biceps tendon frequently is encountered in the setting of coexisting rotator cuff pathology and chronic impingement, but traumatic rupture is occasionally seen, as in this case. Signs and symptoms are not always diagnostic, and MRI or MR arthrography can be a useful tool for evaluation of the tendon in difficult cases. Ideally, an empty bicipital groove is seen, indicating absence of the tendon and rupture. Scar tissue within the groove can be problematic, and correlation with oblique coronal and sagittal images is always recommended. The superior labrum at the attachment of the bicipital anchor should always be inspected carefully, as this is the most common site of rupture, and there may be an associated tear of the superior labrum. Magnetic resonance arthrography is not necessary for diagnosis in most cases, but will provide better visualization of the tendon and bicipital-labral complex."

CD009020,0,10890456,0,"Internal impingement in the shoulder of the overhand athlete: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment.","The etiology of rotator cuff disease is multifactorial in nature. The process by which the articular surface of the rotator cuff can become diseased secondary to direct abutment against the glenoid rim and labrum has been termed internal impingement. Damage to the undersurface of the rotator cuff can occur from contact at the extremes of shoulder motion and can increase secondary to adaptive changes in bone and soft tissue. Diagnosis is achieved in most instances by a thorough physical examination. Adjunctive tests, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, can increase the accuracy of the diagnosis. If this disease is recognized early, nonoperative intervention may be successful. When nonoperative treatment fails, the use of arthroscopy for the treatment of torn rotator cuff and labral tissue and capsular laxity may be indicated to resolve symptoms and restore the premorbid level of function."
CD009020,0,10883604,0,[Recommendations for diagnosis and expert assessment of traumatic rotator cuff lesions].,"Traumatic rotator cuff lesions are a very rare condition. However, this article represents a comprehensive survey according to current knowledge on anatomy, biomechanics, and pathogenesis of rotator cuff pathology. Because of the relatively high prevalence of degenerative changes with increasing age, including partial and complete rotator cuff tears, it may be difficult to demonstrate the causality of an acute traumatic rotator cuff tear. Therefore, a catalogue of potential adequate and inadequate trauma mechanisms is proposed. Emphasis is also placed on posttraumatic diagnostic steps following persistent rotator cuff deficient shoulder function (e.g., ultrasound, MRI). From a legal aspect (e.g., private accident insurance, workers compensation claim), different minor and major criteria are defined, which could help experts to judge the causality of posttraumatic rotator cuff deficiency. These criteria mainly refer to distinct details concerning patients' history, trauma mechanism, primary clinical appearance, and diagnostic findings."
CD009020,0,10883593,0,[Unreamed antegrade humeral interlocking nailing].,"In a prospective clinical study 111 fractures of the humerus in 109 consecutive patients were stabilized with unreamed antegrade interlocking nailing. 97 patients were evaluated with individual follow-up, in the mean at 24.2 months postoperatively. Mean fracture consolidation time was 12.3 weeks (9-16 weeks). Five patients presented a non union. At follow-up 19 patients had a limitation in motion of the shoulder, in the mean with 20% compared to the opposite side. Eight patients had permanent shoulder pain, in nine patients shoulder pain occurred during manual strain of the upper limb. Neither limitation of motion nor pain at the elbow region was present in all cases at follow-up. Ultrasound examination revealed in six cases a lesion of the rotator cuff, which was linked in these cases with permanent pain at the shoulder joint. In five patients a prominent nail tip at the entrance point caused a lesion of the rotator cuff with impingement syndrome. Eight out of nine preoperative palsies of the radial nerve recovered within a mean period of 4.3 months without operative measurements. Unreamed antegrade interlocking nailing of humeral fractures is a safe technique regarding consolidation rate with advantages regarding early mobilization of the upper limb. Careful suturing of the rotator cuff and countersinking of the proximal nail tip at the entrance point is a prerequisite in avoiding permanent lesions of the rotator cuff and shoulder pain."
CD009020,0,10879716,1,MR arthrography of the shoulder: comparison of low-field (0.2 T) vs high-field (1.5 T) imaging.,"The objective of this study was to compare the image quality, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of an open low-field MR system (0.2 T) with a standard high-field MR system (1.5 T) after arthrography of the shoulder. Thirty-eight patients either with suspected chronic instability (n = 12) or rotator cuff abnormalities (n = 26) were examined. Intra-articular injection of diluted Gd-DTPA was followed in randomized order either first by imaging on an open 0.2-T system or on a 1.5-T system. The image material was evaluated independently by two radiologists in a blinded fashion with respect to overall image quality and the detection of rotator cuff as well as capsular and labral abnormalities. Surgical correlation was available in 27 (71%) of 38 patients. For both systems, sensitivity and specificity for rotator cuff tears were 100% each, and for labrum pathologies, these values were 100 and 93%, respectively. The agreement for detection of labral pathologies between low-field and high-field examinations was good (kappa = 0.69, kappa = 0.61). For the detection of full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff, the agreement between the low-field and high-field MR examinations was very good and significant (kappa = 0.94, kappa = 1, p < 0.001). Overall image quality was rated good in 17 (45%) and fair in 21 (55%) of 38 cases on the 0.2-T MR system, and good in 32 (84%) and fair in 6 (16%) of 38 cases on the 1.5-T system. Motion artifacts were considered low in 24 (63%) and moderate in 14 (37%) of 38 cases for the 0.2-T system and low in 34 (89%) and moderate in 4 (11%) for 1.5-T system. Based on our results, low-field MR compares favorably to high-field MR in the detection of major abnormalities of the glenohumeral joint, at least when MR arthrography is used. Disadvantages are the duration of the examination and thus the risk of reduced image quality caused by motion artifacts."

CD009020,0,10872357,0,Entrapment of the suprascapular nerve.,"Operative release for entrapment of the suprascapular nerve was carried out in 35 patients. They were assessed at an average of 30 months (12 to 98) after operation using the functional shoulder score devised by Constant and Murley. The average age at the time of surgery was 40 years (17 to 67). Entrapment was due to injury in ten patients and no cause was found in three; 34 had diffuse posterolateral shoulder pain. The strength of abduction was reduced in all the patients. The average Constant score, unadjusted for age or gender, before operative release was 47% (28 to 53). In 25 of the patients both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles were atrophied and seven had isolated atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle. The average conduction time from Erb's point to the supraspinatus muscle and to the infraspinatus muscle was 5.7 ms (2.8 to 12.8) and 7.4 ms (3.4 to 13.4), respectively. In two patients MRI revealed a ganglion in the infraspinatus fossa and, in another, a complete rupture of the rotator cuff. The average time from the onset of symptoms to operation was ten months (3 to 36). A posterior approach was advocated. The average Constant score, after operative release, unadjusted for age or gender was 77% (35 to 91). The overall result was excellent in ten of the patients, very good in seven, good in 14, fair in two, and poor in two. The symptomatic and functional outcome in our series confirmed the usefulness and safety of operative decompression for entrapment of the suprascapular nerve."
CD009020,0,10856614,0,Three-dimensional ultrasound imaging of the rotator cuff: spatial compounding and tendon thickness measurement.,"Three-dimensional (3-D) volume reconstructions of the shoulder rotator cuff were generated from freehand ultrasound (US) scans acquired with a magnetic tracking system. Image stacks acquired with lateral overlap from multiple acoustic windows were spatially compounded to provide an extended representation of the rotator cuff tendons. A semiautomated technique was developed for measuring rotator cuff thickness from the 3-D compound volumes. Scans of phantoms and volunteer subjects were used to evaluate the accuracy and repeatability of the thickness measurements. For an in vitro phantom with known thickness, the mean difference between the true value and the automatic measurements was 0.05 +/- 0.28 mm. Thickness measurements made manually from 2-D images and automatically from 3-D volumes were different by 0.03 +/- 0.44 mm in vitro and -0.06 +/- 0.36 in vivo. Repeated thickness measurements in vivo differed by 0.06 +/- 0.36 mm. The 3-D measurement technique offers a promising method for evaluating rotator cuff tendons."
CD009020,0,10841058,0,Sonographic differences in the appearance of acute and chronic full-thickness rotator cuff tears.,"This study was undertaken to identify differences in the sonographic appearance of acute and chronic full-thickness rotator cuff tears. The ultrasonograms of 24 patients with an acute rotator cuff tear and 20 with a chronic tear were reviewed for tear size (width), location, and the presence and distribution of fluid. Among these 24 patients, 75% with a midsubstance tear location had an acute tear; 64% of patients with joint or bursal fluid had an acute tear; 80% of patients with a nonvisualized rotator cuff due to a massive tear had a chronic tear; and 73% of patients with no sonographic evidence of bursal or joint fluid had a chronic tear. In conclusion, a midsubstance location and the presence of joint or bursal fluid were more commonly associated with an acute tear. A nonvisualized cuff and the absence of joint and bursal fluid were more commonly observed with a chronic tear."
CD009020,0,10813181,0,The depressor function of biceps on the head of the humerus in shoulders with tears of the rotator cuff.,"We investigated the function of biceps in 18 patients (19 shoulders) with lesions of the rotator cuff. Their mean age was 59 years. Another series of 18 patients (19 shoulders) with normal rotator cuffs as seen on MRI acted as a control group. Their mean age was 55 years. A brace was used to maintain contraction of biceps during elevation. Anteroposterior radiographs were obtained with the arm elevated at 0 degrees , 45 degrees and 90 degrees with and without contraction of biceps. The distance between the centre of the head of the humerus and the glenoid was compared in the two groups. We found that in the group with tears there was significantly greater proximal migration of the head of the humerus at 0 degrees and 45 degrees of elevation without contraction of biceps but depression of the head of the humerus at 0 degrees, 45 degrees and 90 degrees when biceps was functioning. We conclude that biceps is an active depressor of the head of the humerus in shoulders with lesions of the rotator cuff."

Fifteen shoulders of 11 patients (6 female and 5 male) were treated during the past 6 years. The average age was 56.7 years. The duration of hemodialysis averaged 17.5 years. Simple curettage was performed in 7 shoulders, and curettage and bone graft were performed in 5 shoulders. Repair of the rotator cuff was performed in 3 shoulders. Pathologic foci always existed in the intertubercular sulcus and the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Marked proliferations of the bursa and multiple cystic bone lesions were found, and amyloid depositions were observed on histologic evaluation in all cases. Open surgical treatment was quite effective, and relief from the clinical symptoms was maintained for a satisfactory period of time. Enthesopathy induced by the amyloid deposition is considered the main pathology."

The goal of any diagnostic means should be a proper treatment of rotator cuff lesions according to the detected pathology. New arthroscopic techniques to surgically reconstruct rotator cuff tears have brought the operative repair techniques another step further. In cases of large and complex cuff tears the surgeon can individually select an adequate reconstruction procedure which includes anatomical-, partial-, tendon-transfer and muscle-transfer repairs. In cases of irreparable tears with cuff-tear arthropathy and consecutive superior migration of the humeral head hemiarthroplasty or the inverse deltoid prosthesis have to be considered. Based on clinical, radiological and arthroscopic findings we developed algorithms that will lead to the best suited procedure for a given lesion."

There were 6 men and 9 women with a mean age of 65 years. Seventeen nerve injuries were identified, including 12 axillary nerves, 4 suprascapular nerves, and 1 musculocutaneous nerve. One patient had an injury to all three nerves. Thirteen patients underwent operative repair of the torn rotator cuff, and 2 patients who refused surgery were treated conservatively. The average time from injury to surgery was 7.7 months. Follow-up averaged 5.5 years (range: 2-10 years). Clinical results were graded according to pain, range of motion, and strength. Postoperatively, mean active forward elevation was 137 degrees and mean active external rotation was 40 degrees. Clinically, 8 patients achieved complete nerve recovery and 7 had an incomplete recovery. Satisfactory pain relief was achieved in 87% of patients with 60% having excellent or good function. Overall, the results of rotator cuff repair with concurrent nerve injury are less favorable than those of isolated cuff repairs. Careful preoperative assessment of concomitant nerve injury should be performed to better predict outcome."

The purpose of this study was to define the relationship between intramuscular cysts of the rotator cuff and tears of the rotator cuff. Thirteen cases of intramuscular cysts of the rotator cuff were identified on magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder and analyzed retrospectively along with the clinical data. Surgical findings were retrospectively reviewed in 5 patients who underwent follow-up arthroscopy. This series shows that intramuscular cysts of the rotator cuff are associated with small, full-thickness tears or partial undersurface tears of the rotator cuff.

Diagnostic delay often means that surgical repair is no longer possible. In twelve patients who had an irreparable tear of the subscapularis tendon, the superior one-half to two-thirds of the tendon of the pectoralis major muscle was used as a substitute for the subscapularis tendon. In order to adapt the orientation of the transferred muscle to that of the subscapularis, it was routed behind the conjoined tendon of the coracobrachialis muscle and the short head of the biceps to the lesser tuberosity."

Subjects were divided into 3 groups: normal volunteers (n = 10), patients with symptomatic rotator cuff tears severe enough to warrant surgery (n = 10), and subjects with no symptoms who had tears documented on magnetic resonance imaging and normal examination (n = 10). Humeral kinematics were observed with a computer-enhanced modification of the Poppen and Walker technique. Scapular plane x-ray films were obtained at 0 degree, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, and 150 degrees of elevation. Measurements were made by 3 independent observers blinded to the diagnosis, and data interpretation was performed based on mean values for independent observers. Results showed a high degree of interobserver and intraobserver reliability (coefficients = 0.96 and 0.95, respectively). The symptomatic and asymptomatic groups showed progressive superior translation of the humeral head on the glenoid with increasing arm elevation. The normal group, in contrast, maintained a constant center of rotation along the geometric center of the glenoid. Symptomatic and asymptomatic rotator cuff tear groups showed superior head migration from 30 degrees to 150 degrees, which was significantly different from those seen in the normal group. No significant difference between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups was demonstrated with the small numbers used in this study. The presence of a rotator cuff tear was associated in a disruption of normal glenohumeral kinematics in the scapular plane. Because significant superior migration of the humeral head was seen in both the asymptomatic and symptomatic rotator cuff groups, painless and normal shoulder motion is possible in the presence of abnormal glenohumeral kinematics. Abnormal glenohumeral kinematics alone was not an independent factor, which could explain the occurrence of symptoms."

Conventional arthrography can diagnose most rotator cuff tears accurately; however, in many institutions MR arthrography is usually necessary to diagnose labral tears. We utilized decision tree methodology to compare the cost-effectiveness of conventional arthrography and conventional MRI with a hypothetical algorithm in which a patient underwent arthrography, performed with admixed gadolinium, which if negative, was followed by MRI."
CD009020,0,10652663,0,Arthroscopic versus open Bankart repair for traumatic anterior shoulder instability.,"After more than 15 years of experience, arthroscopic shoulder stabilization is becoming less controversial. Historically, recurrence rates following arthroscopic stabilization have been higher than with open stabilization. Although a negligible advantage may exist in terms of expedited postoperative rehabilitation and improved postoperative recovery of motion, critics suggest that its use in contact athletes be limited. The indications for arthroscopic stabilization are expanding, in part, because of improved understanding of the pathophysiology of shoulder instability. Understanding the mechanism of recurrent instability following arthroscopic stabilization offers clues to how physicians can prevent unsatisfactory results in the future. With newer instrumentation and the ability to thermally treat capsular tissue, coexisting pathology, such as capsular plastic deformation, rotator interval lesions, and unrecognized intra-articular pathology, can now be addressed arthroscopically. The judicious use of these techniques is warranted until long-term study results become available. Ideal patients for arthroscopic Bankart repair have a discrete Bankart lesion; a robust, well-developed IGHL; no significant capsular laxity or intraligamentous injury; and an absence of concomitant intra-articular pathology. Additional findings on MR imaging or CT evidence of a discrete labral lesion and pure unidirectional anterior instability during EUA are also good prognostic indicators for arthroscopic Bankart repair. Arthroscopic criteria that render patients less appropriate for an arthroscopic repair include capsular injury, capsular laxity, a bony Bankart lesion, glenohumeral arthritis, and a rotator cuff tear. The authors' believe that either absent or patulous, poorly developed glenohumeral ligaments represent a poor prognostic indicator for a successful outcome following standard arthroscopic Bankart repair. Individuals with poor-quality tissue are more predictably managed using open capsulorrhaphy. Patients with pathologic ligamentous laxity in the absence of a Bankart lesion or any apparent intraligamentous injury to the IGHL are also good candidates for treatment with an open capsulorrhaphy. Findings determined from a thorough physical examination, EUA, and the pathology appreciated during diagnostic arthroscopy help to appropriately choose the surgical procedure that effectively addresses pathology in patients who present with recurrent traumatic anterior instability. Patient preferences and surgical experience are important determinants of procedure selection, and current arthroscopic techniques lack the versatility to uniformly address the entire spectrum of pathology that may be associated with traumatic anterior shoulder instability. Surgeons should always be prepared to convert to an open-stabilization technique if the arthroscopic technique is deficient in addressing all pathology identified at the time of surgery."

In addition, rotator cuff muscle cross-sectional areas were measured on parasagittal MRI scans to establish a possible correlation between rotator cuff muscle atrophy and fatty degeneration. Interobserver reproducibility for grading fatty degeneration was good to excellent for CT and for MRI. The correlation between MRI and CT was fair to moderate and remained unsatisfactory, even if the classification system was simplified with only a 3- rather than a 5-grade scale as originally proposed. The degree of fatty degeneration was significantly related to the amount of atrophy of the respective muscles."
CD009020,0,10633889,0,Is supraspinatus pathology as defined by magnetic resonance imaging associated with clinical sign of shoulder impingement?,"To examine the association between supraspinatus pathology and clinical sign of impingement, 42 workers with and 31 age-matched workers without signs of subacromial impingement had their shoulder examined by magnetic resonance imaging. All subjects were selected from an epidemiologic study evaluating the risk of shoulder impingement syndrome in relation to ergonomic exposure. Physical examination was conducted according to the same protocol and included assessment of shoulder function. Magnetic resonance images were evaluated in a blinded manner with regard to clinical status and age. Twenty-two (55%) subjects in the impingement group and 16 (52%) subjects in the control group had a pathologic supraspinatus tendon (odds ratio 1.13 [95% confidence interval 0.45 to 2.88]). The prevalence of supraspinatus pathology increased from 32% in the youngest to 48% in the middle and 72% in the oldest age group. The results of this study indicate that supraspinatus pathology is related to age rather than to clinical sign of impingement."
CD009020,0,10631903,0,MR imaging of rotator cuff tears: is there a diagnostic benefit of shoulder exercise prior to imaging.,"The purpose of this study was to determine if shoulder exercise prior to MR imaging accentuates findings related to rotator cuff tears. In 32 consecutive patients undergoing MR imaging to evaluate the rotator cuff, after routine MR examination, the joint was moved by active or passive exercise (circumduction, including abduction, if possible) in an attempt to redistribute any joint fluid. The exercise was performed according to pain tolerance and for no longer than 4 minutes. The coronal oblique fast spin-echo T2-weighted images of these patients performed before exercise were reviewed by consensus agreement of two musculoskeletal radiologists who were blinded to clinical information. The appearance of the rotator cuff tendons and the distribution of fluid in the glenohumeral joint were determined. The identical postexercise MR images then were placed alongside the corresponding preexercise MR images, and a direct comparison of findings was made with regard to any change in the appearance of the rotator cuff or joint fluid by consensus opinion of the same two radiologists. Five patients (five shoulders) could not perform exercise because of pain. In the remaining 27 patients (27 shoulders), changes in the location of joint fluid were seen when the preexercise and postexercise images were reviewed together, the diagnosis of partial rotator cuff tear (n = 8) was changed to normal in two cases, and the diagnosis of partial tear was made with more confidence in one case. The diagnoses of normal rotator cuff (n = 16) and complete rotator cuff tear (n = 3) were unchanged. Eight patients had arthroscopy; in each of these, the preexercise and postexercise images showed similar results, and proved to be correct surgically (six normal, one partial rotator cuff tear, and one complete rotator cuff tear). Although postexercise MR images show changes in the distribution of joint fluid when compared to preexercise images, the diagnostic benefits of the postexercise images in the analysis of the rotator cuff appear to be limited."
CD009020,0,10616812,0,The postoperative shoulder.,"Because disability and pain may persist or recur after shoulder surgery, visualization of the postoperative shoulder before further treatment is of great interest. Postoperative status is reevaluated most frequently after rotator cuff repair, capsulorrhaphy in patients with chronic instability, and acromioplasty, where postoperative symptoms are clinically difficult to distinguish from rerupture or inadequate surgical results. Postoperative evaluation or follow-up after surgical treatment of tumors or surgical repair of shoulder injuries are other potential indications. Whereas surgical procedures for osseous components primarily will be evaluated by plain film radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable tool for other sites of surgical treatment, such as soft-tissue components, with further potential indication for magnetic resonance arthrography. This article focuses on normal and abnormal postoperative findings in the shoulder, with emphasis of magnetic resonance imaging, and discusses specific findings based on magnetic resonance arthrography."

Typical findings include local tenderness and weakness of hip abduction. When conservative measures fail to relieve symptoms, surgical release of the iliotibial band over the greater trochanter has been recommended. In the management of seven such patients, an unusual finding was encountered: partial tear of the gluteus medius tendon at its attachment to the greater trochanter. Each patient presented with increasing hip pain of duration of months to years. There were no diagnostic findings on physical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an abnormal signal within the tendon of gluteus medius and fluid within the trochanteric bursa. The disrupted tendons were reattached to bone with heavy nonabsorbable suture. At a median followup of 45 months (range, 21-60 months), all patients were free of pain."

Plain radiographs can be helpful particularly with a history of trauma but give limited information on the soft tissues. Ultrasound is a useful and inexpensive means of assessing the rotator cuff and biceps tendon but has a number of limitations and varying reports on its accuracy.

Sonographic examination revealed rotator cuff tear in 54 shoulders; 38 confirmed at surgery and 16 at arthrography. There was very strong correlation between rotator cuff tear and irregularities of greater tubercle, narrowing of the distance between humeral head and acromion to 5 mm or less, greater tubercle recession, osteophytes and reverse shape of acromion. Last 3 changes were very strongly correlated with medium and large size rotator cuff tear."
CD009020,0,10543593,0,The role of the bicipital groove in tendopathy of the long biceps tendon.,"Long biceps tendon disease is often underrated but plays an important role in anterior shoulder pain. We studied prospectively the anatomy of the bicipital groove and its relationship to clinical symptoms. Sixty-seven consecutive patients were investigated by mutual ultrasonography and radiographs of the intertubercular groove. All images were scrutinized for biceps tendon status (ultrasonography) and groove anatomy (radiography). Thirty-seven patients (21 male, 16 female, average age 48 years) had chronic anterior shoulder pain, and 30 patients (16 male, 14 female, average age 46 years) served as a control group. In 28 shoulders we found sonographic signs of tendovaginitis, and in 14 we found degenerative changes. The mean age of patients with pathologic conditions of the long biceps tendon was 40 years, significantly lower than that of the complete study group. The x-ray films revealed a great variation in the medial and total opening angle of the groove, whereas width, depth, and humeral head diameter showed sex-related differences. Radiologic signs of groove degeneration correlated in 43.6% with biceps tendon disease on the sonogram. Our study revealed statistically significant correlations between groove anatomy and long biceps tendon disease, which should be considered more while shoulder problems are evaluated."
CD009020,0,10526487,0,[Pathology of the rotator cuff].,"In daily practice painful shoulder is frequent. Rotator cuff pathology (traumatic, microtraumatic or both) is frequently involved. Treatment is closely related to diagnosis, which directly depends on features given by the triad ""questioning, clinical exam, standard X-rays"". In some very precise cases this triad will be completed by more complex exams (arthro CT, MRI). Rotator cuff pathology is diversified: either tendinopathies (calcifying or not) or tears (partial or transfixiant). Rotator cuff tear's natural evolution is a slow aggravation to a final subacromial arthrosis or an excentrated omarthrosis in a certain term which tolerance may vary."
CD009020,0,10526486,0,[Imaging of the shoulder].,"Except for instability, a variety of causes has been described in the painful shoulder. A thorough clinical examination may help establish the cause of shoulder pain. Even if modern imaging modalities (ultrasonography, computed tomography, MR imaging) allowed a precise diagnostic and therapeutic approach, plain radiographs are still necessary. Performed by an experienced radiologist, ultrasonography may be useful for the assessment of rotator cuff tears which are a common problem. CT arthrography and MR imaging are only recommended in preoperative assessment. In calcific tendinitis plain radiographs provide evidence of calcifications. It is not difficult to establish clinically the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis and arthrography is the only technique to reveal the articular capacity limitation reliably. In degenerative osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint, CT arthrography is necessary to assess the rotator cuff changes and lenoid osseus findings before undergoing shoulder arthroplasty."

CD009020,0,10506358,0,[Current status and perspectives of shoulder replacement].,"Basis of the modern shoulder implants is the Neer II-system, a non constrained total shoulder prosthesis with conforming radii of curvature and improved protection against dislocation. The second generation of shoulder prosthesis is based on the geometric shaft design of the Neer II prosthesis and offers not only a variety of modular head- and shaft-sizes but also through different radii a physiologic rotation-translation-mechanism. The third generation of humeral head prosthesis carries the concept of an anatomic reconstruction one step further and enables the surgeon to adjust the inclination and the eccentric offset of the humeral head to restore the centre of rotation. The latest development in shoulder arthroplasty are humeral head prosthesis with a fully variable 3-dimensional modularity to independently adjust the prosthetic head position regardless of the individual shaft geometry. This achieves a 3-dimensional adaptability of the prosthetic head about the stem axis in the coronary and in the sagittal plane. Besides of the humeral shaft prosthesis an alternative concept of shoulder joint replacement is established - the replacement of the humeral head articular surface. A hemispheric surface prosthesis - cup arthroplasty - is cemented onto the residual humeral head, which eliminates the obligatory humeral head resection and the reaming of the medullary canal. Bipolar shoulder prosthesis are humeral shaft prosthesis with a bi-rotational head system. Their indication is limited to pre-existing lesions of the rotator cuff and/or the glenoid surface. The inverse total shoulder prosthesis reverses the articular surface morphology of the humeral head and the glenoid. The hemispheric glenoid component serves as the centre of rotation for the concave epiphyseal proximal humerus component. This implant is especially used in cases of massive rotator cuff deficiencies. The role of shoulder prosthesis in treating acute humeral head fractures needs special consideration. A fracture prosthesis has to restore the exact length of the humerus, the centre of rotation, and the anatomical retroversion. Positioning of the tubercula and their adequate osteosynthesis is most critical and fundamental to ensure a correct healing process. A failed consolidation of the tubercula does not lead to a satisfying result. The shoulder joint replacement can be sufficiently fixated in cemented, cementless or hybrid techniques. Today several component design variations of cemented glenoid implants exist. Their main distinction is the fixation system which can be divided into two main groups - the keel - and the peg-shaped glenoid components. The peg-shaped anchorage system shall guarantee a greater stability against shear-forces. Cementless glenoid components consist of a polyethylene inlay and a surface treated metal-back with an integrated fixation system. These fixation systems are object of intensive biomechanical research and range from conventional screw fixation to specialised cone systems and self-cutting cage-screw-systems. The critical area of cementless glenoid components is the transition zone of the PE-inlay and the metal-back because of high force development. The question of implanting a hemi- or total shoulder prosthesis is answered by the morphologic changes of the glenoid articular surface, which includes the size of the subchondral defect and the underlying etiology of the shoulder joint disease, and the age of the patient. Preoperative planning must consist of an adequate radiologic work-up - X-ray, CT or MRI - to accurately assess the glenoid morphology. G. Walch categorised the different glenoid lesions and developed a very important classification of possible glenoid deformations. To compare and evaluate the operative results one must consider the different shoulder prosthesis and the discrepancies between a hemi- and a total shoulder prosthetic replacement. Looking at the loosening and survival rate of the implant the results are"

One-hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with full-thickness cuff tears diagnosed by standard cuff-imaging methods (sonography, arthrography, or magnetic resonance imagery) assessed their own shoulder function and health status with the Simple Shoulder Test and the Short Form 36, respectively. As a group, these patients were substantially compromised in their ability to perform the functions of the Simple Shoulder Test and in the Short Form 36 scales of physical role, physical function, and comfort. As individuals, however, their self-assessments varied widely. The standard deviations were often greater than 50% of the mean and the range of responses often covered the entire scale from the minimum possible score to the maximum possible score. These results show the importance of documenting the clinical expression of cuff tears in patients at initial evaluation and when treatment is being considered. The results also show the practicality of standardized self-assessment questionnaires in such documentation."
CD009020,0,10471998,0,Age-related prevalence of rotator cuff tears in asymptomatic shoulders.,"To determine the prevalence of rotator cuff tears in asymptomatic shoulders we conducted a prospective clinical and ultrasonographic study of 411 volunteers. We anticipated an age-dependent outcome and divided the patients into 4 age-groups. Overall, we found evidence of a rotator cuff tear in 23% of the patients. In group 1 (aged 50 to 59 years), 13% (22 of 167) of the patients had tears; in group 2 (aged 60 to 69 years), 20% (22 of 108) of the patients had tears; in group 3 (aged 70 to 79 years), 31% (27 of 87) of the patients had tears; and in group 4 (age > 80 years), 51% (25 of 49) of the patients had tears. An astonishingly high rate of rotator cuff tears in patients with asymptomatic shoulders was thus demonstrated with increasing patient age. At this stage it remains unclear, however, which parameters convert an asymptomatic rotator cuff tear into a symptomatic tear. As a result, rotator cuff tears must to a certain extent be regarded as ""normal"" degenerative attrition, not necessarily causing pain and functional impairment."

We have developed a new index to improve the sonographic diagnosis of chronic tears of the cuff. In a pilot study, we examined 50 asymptomatic healthy volunteers by ultrasound to establish the diameter of the rotator cuff in relation to the tendon of the long head of biceps. Subsequently, the index was calculated in 64 patients who had had shoulder pain for more than three months caused by clinically diagnosed lesions of the rotator cuff. The compensatory hypertrophy of the biceps tendon was quantified sonographically in relation to the diameter of the cuff. Comparison with the contralateral shoulder revealed a significantly higher biceps rotator-cuff ratio (p < 0.05) for patients with torn rotator cuffs. A ratio greater than 0.8 was considered pathological (index positive); the mean ratio in the control group was 0.43. The sensitivity of a positive index was 97.8%, the specificity 63.2%, the positive predictive value 86.3%, and the negative predictive value 92.4% in comparison with surgical findings.

Fifteen patients (nine male, six female) with chronic shoulder pain were enrolled in this study. Each patient was referred to rule out rotator cuff lesion. The ultrasonographic examination showed an anechoic cystic lesion in the shoulder region in every patient and abnormality of the rotator cuff in only four patients. Under ultrasonographic guidance, an 18 gauge needle was inserted into the cyst to aspirate the fluid. Initial sonographic imaging showed the cyst, which appeared as a localized fluid accumulation and was located between the deltoid muscle and the subscapularis tendon in seven patients, between the deltoid muscle and the biceps tendon in one patient, below the coracoacromial ligament in five patients, and over suprascapular notch area in one patient. The ganglion cysts ranged in size from 3.5 to 30 mm. The amount of aspirated fluid in each cyst varied from 0.4 to 12 ml (mean, 2.6 ml +/- 3.1) with a clear or light yellowish color and a jelly-like appearance. No major complications occurred during or after this procedure. The symptom (pain) was improved after sonographically guided aspiration in each patient. Follow-up study showed complete relief of pain in four patients, marked improvement in nine patients, and mild improvement but still persistent shoulder pain in two patients. Duration of follow-up study ranged from 2 to 24 months (mean, 6.4 months +/- 6.9). The success rate for sonographically guided aspiration was 86% on the basis of marked symptom improvement or relief.

A standard series of MR images was obtained for each. The results of functional assessment were scored according to the system of Constant. According to MRI evaluation, 21 (68%) patients had an intact or thinned rotator cuff and 10 (32%) had recurrence of a full-thickness cuff defect at follow-up. Patients with an intact or thinned rotator cuff had a median Constant score of 75.5 points; patients with a full-thickness cuff defect had a median score of 62 points. There was no correlation between tendon integrity on postoperative MR images and functional outcome. Patients with intact or thinned cuffs did not have significantly better functional results than patients with retorn cuffs.

Women ruptured the cuff more often than men. If the patient is not able to elevate the affected arm more than 90 degrees in the scapular plane 2 weeks after the dislocation, there should be a high suspicion of rotator cuff tear (76.7%). For early detection of relevant rotator cuff lesions, we recommend shoulder ultrasonographic examination and measurement of active elevation after each traumatic shoulder dislocation in the above mentioned age group."
CD009020,0,10367523,1,[The sensitivity and specificity of sonographic examination in detection of rotator cuff tear].,"Sonographic examination was performed in 72 patients (74 shoulders) suffering from different shoulder diseases. The results were correlated with findings obtained during subsequent surgery in 57 patients (58 shoulders) and arthrography in 15 cases (16 shoulders). Rotator cuff tear was proved during surgical procedure in 37 patients (38 shoulders). The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography in detection of cuff tear was 98.2% and 90% respectively. In case of partial cuff tear ultrasonography had lower sensitivity--50% while specificity was 96.3%. In detection of supraspinatus tendon tear the ultrasound sensitivity was 100% and specificity 95.6%, in case of infraspinatus tear sensitivity was 66.7% and specificity 94% while for subscapularis tear these values were equal 75% and 98.1%. The size of sonographically estimated cuff defect correlated properly with intrasurgical measurement in 76.3% of all cases."
CD009020,0,10358723,1,Ultrasonographic analysis of shoulder rotator cuff tears.,"Seventy-nine shoulders suspected of rotator cuff tears were examined by ultrasonography (US) and forty-three received surgery. Long and short axis scans were performed and findings of each were separately classified according to a five-grade system, and the results were correlated with the actual extent of tear observed during surgery. Internal echogenicity and subacromial impingement were analyzed before and after surgery. A accuracy of US in detecting rotator cuff tears was analyzed. In addition, the correlation between cuff shape observed by US before surgery and actual shape observed during surgery was assessed. It was noted that cuff thinning and abnormalities in shape did not recover to normal after surgery. However, in the cases of discontinuities observed by US before surgery, US findings indicated that the torn cuff was anchored to the greater tuberosity and functional during active motion. Although post-operative US findings were not normal, clinical results were good in most cases. Sensitivity of US for detecting rotator cuff tear was 100% and specificity 94%. US is non-invasive, cost effective and allows the physician to examine the joint while it is in motion. Therefore, at this time, we use US as a screening method for detecting rotator cuff tears. Furthermore, US allows us to check for re-tears while the joint is in motion, which is essential for accurate diagnosis."
CD009020,0,10354876,1,Diagnostic and therapeutic impact of MRI and arthrography in the investigation of full-thickness rotator cuff tears.,"Investigation of shoulder pain is important before surgical treatment. The presence or absence of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear (FTRCT) may determine the type of surgical treatment. Both MRI and conventional arthrography can be used, but little is known about their relative diagnostic and therapeutic impact. We performed a prospective trial assessing: (a) the influence of MRI and arthrography results on the clinician's diagnostic thinking (diagnostic impact); (b) the influence of the results on the clinician's therapeutic thinking (therapeutic impact); and (c) the diagnostic performance of the two techniques in patients with surgical confirmation. A total of 104 consecutive patients with shoulder problems referred to a specialist orthopaedic shoulder clinic underwent pre-operative investigation with MRI and arthrography. The surgeon's diagnosis, diagnostic confidence and planned treatment were measured before the investigation, and then again after the results of each investigation. Before the presentation of the investigation, results, the patients were randomised into two groups. In one group MRI was presented first; in the other group, arthrography. The MRI results led to fewer changes in diagnostic category (14 of 46, 30%) than arthrography (20 of 54, 37%), but the difference was not significant (P > 0.5). Magnetic resonance imaging led to slightly more changes in planned management (17 of 47, 36%) than arthrography (14 of 55, 25%), but again the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.3). The results of the second investigation always had less diagnostic and therapeutic impact than the first. The accuracy of MRI for FTRCT in 38 patients with surgical confirmation was 79%, sensitivity 81% and specificity 78%; the accuracy of arthrography was 82%, sensitivity 50% and specificity 96%. The clinical diagnosis and management plan can be adequately defined by a single radiological investigation. Magnetic resonance imaging and arthrography had fairly similar diagnostic and therapeutic impact and comparable accuracy, although MRI was more sensitive and less specific. Magnetic resonance imaging may be the preferred investigation because of its better demonstration of soft tissue anatomy."

The typical signs and symptoms of a ruptured long-head biceps tendon include anterior shoulder pain, tenderness in the bicipital groove, and unusual bulging of the injured biceps. The history and physical exam are generally sufficient to make the diagnosis, but x-rays and MRI may be helpful to rule out related disorders. Because the injury is often associated with rotator cuff tendinitis, a complete shoulder exam is necessary. Conservative treatment will enable most patients to regain normal strength."

CD009020,0,10336198,0,Rotator cuff: evaluation with US and MR imaging.,"Magnetic resonance (MR) and ultrasound (US) imaging are currently touted for assessment of rotator cuff disease. Optimum clinical imaging techniques include use of (a) a 1.5-T MR imaging unit with small planar coils, proton-density-weighted and T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, and 10-12-cm fields of view (yielding 400-470 x 500-625-microm in-plane spatial resolution) and (b) a state-of-the-art commercial US unit with insonation frequencies of 9-13 MHz (yielding 200-400-microm axial and lateral resolution). Proper diagnosis requires familiarity with normal anatomic characteristics and imaging pitfalls. Care must be taken to avoid sonographic tendon anisotropy and MR imaging magic angle effects, which can be misinterpreted as rotator cuff tear. At MR imaging, a complete cuff tear typically appears as either a hyperintense defect or a tendinous avulsion that extends from the bursal to the articular side of the cuff; a partial cuff tear typically appears as a focal hyperintense region that contacts only one surface of the cuff. Complete and partial tears manifest with a wide spectrum of findings at US. MR imaging and US are effective for evaluating rotator cuff injuries, with high reported accuracies for detection of complete tears but more disparate results for detection of partial tears."

Ten throwing college baseball athletes were prospectively clinically examined for instability, range of motion, impingement signs, and relocation testing, then evaluated with bilateral gadolinium enhanced MRI using the nonthrowing shoulder as a control. All MRIs were performed on a 1.5-Tesla magnet and included routine adduction images and images obtained in abduction and external rotation (ABER). Studies were interpreted by a musculoskeletal radiologist and an orthopaedic surgeon specializing in shoulder surgery. In all shoulders, ABER imaging showed physical contact between the undersurface of the rotator cuff and the posterior superior glenoid. No imaging or physical examination abnormalities were identified in the nonthrowing shoulders. Three of 10 throwing shoulders had superior labral tears and adjacent paralabral cysts extending toward or into the spinoglenoid notch. Four of 10 throwing shoulders had abnormal signal change in the rotator cuff tendons. No correlation was identified between positive MRI findings and instability on physical examination. Physical contact between the rotator cuff undersurface and the subjacent labrum can be seen normally in the ABER position. Abnormalities of the rotator cuff and superior labrum are seen in asymptomatic throwing shoulders but not nonthrowing shoulders. MRI abnormalities consistent with internal impingement can be seen in asymptomatic patients. Treatment of these abnormalities in young throwing athletes should be approached with caution."

CD009020,0,10216997,0,[Paralytic shoulder secondary to post-traumatic peripheral nerve lesions in the adult].,"A critical review is presented of the indications for nerve repair or transfer and for palliative operations in the management of paralytic shoulder following traumatic neurological injuries in the adult. Different situations are considered: paralytic shoulder following supraclavicular lesions of the brachial plexus, following retro- and infraclavicular lesions and following lesions to the terminal branches of the plexus (axillary, suprascapular and musculocutaneous nerves) and finally problems related to lesions of the accessory nerve and the long thoracic nerve. I. Supraclavicular lesions of the brachial plexus. In complete (C5 to T1) lesions, the possibilities for nerve repair or transfer are at best limited, and the aim is to restore active flexion of the elbow. Palliative operations may be associated in order to stabilize the shoulder. In case of a complete C5 to T1 root avulsion, amputation at the distal humerus may be considered but is rarely performed combined with shoulder arthrodesis if the trapezius and serratus anterior muscles are functioning. The shoulder may also be stabilized by a ligament plasty using the coracoacromial ligament. In cases where the supraspinatus and long head of the biceps have recovered, but where active external rotation is absent, function may be improved by derotation osteotomy of the humerus. In partial C5,6 or C5,6,7 lesions, the indications for nerve repair and transfer are wider, as well as the indications for muscle transfers. In C5,6 lesions, a neurotization from the accessory nerve to the suprascapular nerve gives 60% satisfactory results; this is also true following treatment of C5,6,7 lesions, whereas restoration of active elbow flexion is obtained in 100% of cases in C5,6 lesions but only in 86% in C5,6,7 lesions. In cases where shoulder function has not been restored, palliative operations may be considered: arthrodesis or, more often, derotation osteotomy of the humerus which can be combined with transfer of the teres major and latissimus dorsi. II. Retro- and infraclavicular lesions of the brachial plexus. Twenty-five percent of the lesions of the brachial plexus occur in the retro- or infraclavicular region and involve the secondary trunks, most commonly the posterior trunk. Nerve repair should be performed early. The shoulder may be affected owing to involvement of the axillary nerve in cases of lesions of the posterior trunk, often associated with a lesion of the suprascapular nerve. Regarding the terminal branches (axillary, suprascapular and musculocutaneous nerves), spontaneous recovery may be expected in a significant proportion of cases but is often delayed (6-9 months), and the problem is to avoid unnecessary operations while not unduly delaying surgical repair in cases where it is indicated. MRI may be useful to delineate those cases where surgery is indicated: repair is usually performed around 6 months following trauma. Isolated lesions of the axillary nerve may be repaired with good results using a nerve graft. The lesion may occur in combination with a lesion of the suprascapular nerve; the latter may be interrupted at several levels. Proximal repair may be performed using a nerve graft; distal lesions are more difficult to repair and may require intramuscular neurotization. Lesions of the musculocutaneous nerve may be repaired with good results using a nerve graft. Lesions of the axillary nerve may be seen associated with lesions of the rotator cuff. The treatment varies according to the age and condition of the patient and according to the condition of the cuff muscles and tendons: in a young patient with avulsion of the tendons from bone, cuff reinsertion is indicated; in an older patient, the cuff must be evaluated by MRI or arthroscan, and repair is indicated unless the cuff tear is not amenable to surgery or there is fatty degeneration of the muscles. Palliative surgery may be indicated in cases seen late or after failed attempts at nerve repair. (ABSTRACT"
CD009020,0,10210067,0,Arthroscopic debridement and acromioplasty versus mini-open repair in the treatment of significant partial-thickness rotator cuff tears.,"Partial tears of the rotator cuff, especially of the articular side, have received attention only with the recent ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and arthroscopy to diagnose these lesions. Several early reports showed nearly 100% success in managing these lesions with arthroscopic debridement with or without acromioplasty. This series compares 32 patients with significant partial-thickness rotator cuff tears treated with debridement and acromioplasty versus 33 patients with mini-open repair. Follow-up was from 2 to 7 years. Preoperative MRI was not useful; when positive, preoperative arthrography was useful for articular side tears. Of the tears, 12% were bursal side tears and the remainder were articular side tears; all were at least 50% or more of the thickness of the tendon. A significant number of the arthroscopic group had fair results by UCLA score criteria. Three patients reruptured the remaining cuff later despite adequate acromioplasty. Healing of the partial tear was never observed at second-look arthroscopy. Although postoperative pain was significantly greater and recovery slower with open repair, no patient was reoperated on and rerupture of the repair did not occur. The outstanding results of prior studies of cuff debridement were not duplicated in this series of cuff debridements with long-term follow-up. Adequate acromioplasty alone does not prophylactically prevent rotator cuff tear progression. Recognition and repair of these significant partial tears may be advisable for the long-term function of the shoulder despite short-term improvement in morbidity with arthroscopic treatment."

With arthroscopy as the standard of reference, the accuracy of MRI for diagnosing shoulder disease was assessed. Pathologic conditions were organized into 3 groups: (1) labral tears, (2) rotator cuff disease, and (3) other pathologic conditions. At arthroscopic evaluation there were 15 labral tears, 24 rotator cuff tears, and 27 other abnormalities. MRI identified 11 of the labral injuries, with accuracy of 62%, sensitivity 73%, and specificity 58%. Rotator cuff tears were identified by MRI with accuracy of 68%, sensitivity 96%, and specificity 49%. When partial rotator cuff tears were differentiated from complete tears, only 16 of 24 injuries were identified by MRI. Nonrotator cuff, nonlabral disease was identified with accuracy of 75%, sensitivity 63%, and specificity 87%. In our center MRI does not appear to be an accurate effective tool for assessing shoulder pathologic conditions in patients in whom the clinical picture is not clear and therefore may not be of assistance in surgical planning for patients with these difficult conditions."

Pathologic changes associated with internal impingement seem to develop with repetitive placement of the arm into a position of extreme external rotation and abduction. Findings may include lesions of the posterior superior labrum, undersurface irritation, or tearing of the supraspinatus-infraspinatus junction near the attachment site and cystic changes of the posterior superior glenoid and posterior lateral greater tuberosity. There is no evidence for a particular sequence of pathologic changes.

Appreciation of the anatomic structures, functional importance, and mechanisms of injury are invaluable in appropriate assessment, both by physical examination and diagnostic MR imaging. The long biceps tendon; the superior labrum and labral-biceps anchor; the coracohumeral ligament merging with the rotator interval capsule and the superior glenohumeral ligament; the ligamentous reflection pulley for the long biceps tendon at the far lateral margin of the interval extending to the lesser tuberosity and proximal bicipital groove, bounded by the distal superior margin of the subscapularis and anterior margin of the supraspinatus tendons; and the transverse humeral ligament extending between the lesser and greater tuberosities along the proximal bicipital groove all are intimately associated in this region and may be injured together. Understanding of the anatomy and function of the rotator interval continues to evolve. Rotator interval injury may be better understood as a complex or spectrum rather than an isolated lesion. When any one of the spectrum of associated injuries is suspected or found, all of the other possible associated injuries should be considered and evaluated, both on clinical and MR imaging evaluations."

CD009020,0,9934421,0,"Which is more useful, the ""full can test"" or the ""empty can test,"" in detecting the torn supraspinatus tendon?","The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical usefulness of the full can and empty can tests for determining the presence of a torn supraspinatus tendon. The two tests were performed in 143 shoulders of 136 consecutive patients. In each test, the muscle strength was determined by manual muscle testing, and the presence of pain during the maneuver was recorded. We interpreted the tests as positive when there was 1) pain, 2) muscle weakness, or 3) pain or muscle weakness or both. Shoulders were examined by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging with 95% accuracy for full-thickness rotator cuff tears. There were 35 shoulders with full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus tendon. The accuracy of the tests was the greatest when muscle weakness was interpreted as indicating a torn supraspinatus tendon in both the full can test (75% accurate) and the empty can test (70% accurate). However, there was no significant difference between the accuracy of the tests when this criterion was used. Pain was observed in 62 shoulders (43%) during the full can test and in 71 shoulders (50%) during the empty can test, but the difference was not statistically significant. Muscle weakness should be interpreted as indicative of supraspinatus tendon tear. Using this indicator, both tests are equivalent in terms of accuracy, but considering pain provocation, the full can test may be more beneficial in the clinical setting."

CD009020,0,9930100,0,Electromyographic activities of the biceps during arm elevation in shoulders with rotator cuff tears.,"We investigated electromyographic activities of the biceps in 40 shoulders with full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff and 40 asymptomatic shoulders, with a normal rotator cuff on MRI, to determine the role of the biceps in cuff-deficient shoulders. Using surface electrodes, biceps activities were recorded during arm elevation in the scapular plane with and without a 1-kg load. The percentages of integrated electromyograms to the maximum voluntary contraction (%MVC) were obtained at 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, and 120 degrees of elevation. In the normal shoulders, %MVC of the biceps was always less than 10% through the arc of elevation both with and without load. Among 40 shoulders with rotator cuff tears, 14 showed increased activities of the biceps more than 10% in %MVC (p < 0.0001), whereas the remaining 26 shoulders had activities similar to the normal shoulders. The biceps activities in these 14 shoulders increased with load application and at higher angles of elevation. The muscle strength tended to be weaker in shoulders with increased biceps activities than in those without. Our findings suggest a potential supplemental function of the biceps in shoulders with rotator cuff tears."
CD009020,0,9916188,0,Partial-thickness tears of the rotator cuff: evaluation and management.,"The approach to management of a partial-thickness rotator cuff tear is best made with the understanding that this is not a singular condition. Rather, partial tears represent the common outcome of a variety of insults to the rotator cuff. Degenerative changes due to aging, anatomic impingement, and trauma may all be etiologic agents. Overhead athletes may develop tears due to repetitive microtrauma or internal impingement. Outlet radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging are recommended for routine preoperative evaluation. A nonoperative treatment program for rotator cuff strengthening and stretching is appropriate as initial treatment; modification of activities and anti-inflammatory medication are often used as well. Operative management may be considered when nonoperative treatment fails. Arthroscopic evaluation is required to determine the true extent of the cuff lesion. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression is recommended when outlet impingement is present. Rotator cuff debridement or formal cuff repair is dependent on the size of the cuff defect and the age and activity level of the patient. The importance of recognizing the different causes of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears is emphasized in this review of pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis, imaging, and treatment."

Fourteen of the 23 uninvolved shoulders with no abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging were also studied as normal shoulders. With a portable thermometer with the probes attached to the anterior surface of both shoulders, the skin temperature was recorded every 5 minutes from 1:00 PM to 9:00 AM (20 hours). Both the normal and cuff tear shoulders showed a similar circadian rhythm with the temperature at night significantly lower than the temperature during the daytime (P < .0001). On the other hand, the tendinitis shoulders did not show this circadian rhythm; the temperature did not change significantly through the range of measurement. We conclude that the skin temperature shows a circadian rhythm in normal shoulders, and this rhythm may be affected by certain pathologic conditions of the shoulder."

CD009020,0,9866777,0,The anterior tilt of the acromion: radiographic evaluation and correlation with shoulder diseases.,"The aim of this study was to test whether the anterior tilt of the acromion can be objectively evaluated on lateral radiographs, and whether there is a relation between this anatomical feature and the most common shoulder diseases. Lateral radiographs of 15 dried scapulas were performed in neutral position and with 5 degrees of caudal, cranial, anterior and posterior angulations. Two hundred and forty-three shoulders, both asymptomatic and affected by chronic and post-traumatic impingement, calcific tendinitis and instability, were examined by conventional radiography. The presence of rotator-cuff tears was investigated by sonography. A method was elaborated to obtain reproducible lateral radiographs and to determine the acromial tilt angle. Inter- and intraobserver and inter- and intraoperator variations in measurements were evaluated. Variations in tube angulation produced changes in tilt-angle values on dried scapulas. The average tilt angle for the chronic impingement and the instability groups were significantly different from the post-traumatic, calcific tendinitis and control groups. Rotator-cuff tears were significantly more frequent in the chronic impingement group and related to a more acute tilt angle. The inter- and intraobserver variability coefficients were 0.95 and 0.98, whereas the inter- and intraoperator variability coefficients were 0.94 and 0.96, respectively. Conventional radiography using fluoroscopy for positioning is a well-reproducible method for the evaluation of acromial tilt. There is a significant difference in tilt-angle values between some groups of subjects examined, but the lack of specificity limits the clinical importance of such measurement."

In 17% of cases, a glenohumeral arthrosis was diagnosed be radiological means. 18% had radiological signs of a previous fracture of the greater tuberosity. Hill-Sachs lesions were identified in 19% of cases. Rotator cuff tears were diagnosed in 9% by ultrasound. No relationship between the duration of immobilization and the recurrence rate was found (P = 0.95).

Fifty-two shoulders were examined in 26 embalmed cadavers. The average age at the time of death was 76.3 years. Rotator cuff tears were observed in 32 (61.5%) shoulders. Six (11.5%) shoulders had massive rotator cuff tears and were excluded from the study, leaving 46 shoulders for study. Twenty shoulders had a tear of the supraspinatus tendon, and 17 had a tear of the subscapularis tendon. All tears of the subscapularis tendon were articular-side incomplete tears. On histologic examination most pathologic changes of the subscapularis tendon were observed on the articular side of the upper portion. Lesions of the long head of the biceps brachii were identified in 14 (30.4%) shoulders. A statistically significant correlation was found between tears of the subscapularis tendon and the presence of lesions of the long head of the biceps brachii (P=.0014). In addition, the results of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging of 15 patients (average age, 62.9 years) with a surgically confirmed diagnosis of incomplete tears of the subscapularis tendon in conjunction with tears of the supraspinatus tendon were also evaluated.

Cystic changes were observed in 49 shoulders (35%) and the commonest site was in the bare bone area of the anatomical neck, and the second commonest site was at the attachment of the supraspinatus tendon. Cystic changes in the bare bone area were observed equally often in shoulders with or without rotator cuff tears (27% and 18%, respectively) and were more frequently observed in the elderly. Cystic changes at the attachment of the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons were specific to rotator cuff tears: they were observed in 28% of rotator cuff tears, but in none of those with an intact cuff. We conclude that there are two distinct types of cystic changes: one at the attachment of the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons, which is closely related to tears of these tendons, and the other in the bare bone area of the anatomical neck, which is related to aging."

Nine-year follow-up of 96 cases.,"We performed open acromioplasty for intractable impingement syndrome on 96 shoulders (93 patients) with an intact rotator cuff. All the shoulders were examined by ultrasound after a mean interval of nine years. Those showing pathological findings, a poor or fair subjective result, or deterioration of the primary excellent outcome had MRI and/or arthrography. The mean Constant score for the affected shoulders was 70 points and that for 48 non-involved, symptom-free shoulders, 84 points. The subjective outcome was excellent in 45, good in 24, fair in 18 and poor in 9 shoulders. Complete tears were found in 12 shoulders and partial tears in seven. A total of 14 shoulders was symptom-free after acromioplasty, but after an average of five years became painful again and showed deterioration. Of these, six had complete tears and four partial tears of the cuff. The tear rate was 4% in shoulders initially judged to be excellent, 25% in good, 33% in fair and 55% in poor shoulders. The tear rate was 71% in shoulders which subsequently deteriorated. The incidence was higher in men (25%) than in women (11%). We conclude that a tear of the rotator cuff may appear after acromioplasty, although there was no evidence of a tear at the time of operation. This is usually the reason for deterioration in a shoulder with an initially good operative outcome."
CD009020,0,9759817,0,The treatment of symptomatic os acromiale.,"During a four-year period, fourteen individuals (fifteen shoulders) who had been seen at the shoulder service of our institution because of pain in the shoulder had a radiographic finding of an os acromiale. On clinical examination, the pain appeared to be due to an unstable os acromiale because the patients had point tenderness over the acromion and pain on forward elevation of the shoulder. The diagnosis of an os acromiale was confirmed on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, or a bone scan. Eight patients had an associated tear of the rotator cuff. The os acromiale was located in the pre-acromion in one shoulder, the meso-acromion in eleven shoulders, and the meta-acromion in three shoulders. At the operation, the anterior aspect of the acromion was found to be unstable in all shoulders. Eleven patients (twelve shoulders) had open reduction of the os acromiale and insertion of an autogenous iliac-crest bone graft. Of those patients, four (five shoulders) had open reduction and internal fixation with a tension-band procedure with use of pins and wires. Only one of those shoulders had a solid osseous union, and the other four shoulders had a non-union that was due to a disruption of the fixation. The remaining seven patients (seven shoulders) had open reduction and internal fixation with use of cannulated screws and a tension-band construct; a solid osseous union was achieved in all but one of them. One patient had excision of the pre-acromion, which relieved the pain. Two patients who had had failed open reduction and internal fixation had excision of a grossly unstable os acromiale in the meso-acromion; both patients had pain and weakness after this procedure. Of the twelve shoulders that had open reduction and bone-grafting, seven had union of the os acromiale; the average time to radiographic and clinical union was nine weeks (range, seven to twenty weeks). We concluded that, although it is rare, symptomatic unstable os acromiale does occur and can be effectively treated with use of autogenous bone-grafting and internal fixation with a rigid tension-band construct and cannulated screws."

CD009020,0,9663318,0,A review of the role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of shoulder impingement syndrome and rotator cuff tendon tears.,"The objective of this paper is to present a review of the role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of shoulder impingement syndrome and rotator cuff tendon tears. This imaging modality is effective in demonstrating both the soft tissue and bony abnormalities associated with structural shoulder impingement which include subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis, supraspinatus tendinopathy, rotator cuff tendon tears, subacromial osteophytic spurs and acromioclavicular joint capsular hypertrophy and osteophytosis. The detection of a subacromial osteophytic spur is considered specific for shoulder impingement syndrome. The 3 most accurate magnetic resonance imaging signs of a full thickness supraspinatus tendon tear reported are: tendon discontinuity, musculotendinous junction retraction and supraspinatus tendon thinning. The most specific sign is tendon discontinuity and the most sensitive is subacromial-subdeltoid bursal fluid."

The findings in 42 consecutive surgical cases were compared with the preoperative sonographic readings. Ultrasound detected all of the 10 full-thickness cuff tears identified at surgery (sensitivity 1.0, specificity 0.97) but detected only 6 of 13 partial-thickness cuff tears (sensitivity 0.46, specificity 0.97). A full-thickness tear was falsely diagnosed in one case of severe cuff abrasion. Dynamic scan criteria correctly diagnosed impingement in 27 of 34 cases (sensitivity 0.79, positive predictive value 0.96). Abnormalities of the long head of the biceps were accurately diagnosed with the exception of low-grade tendinitis and the superior labral tear, anterior to posterior, lesion. We concluded that ultrasound is a sensitive and accurate method of identifying patients with full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff, extracapsular biceps tendon pathology, or both.

The subjects were 12 patients with suprascapular nerve palsy who underwent magnetic resonance imaging examinations. In 9 of 12 cases ganglion cysts were found at the spinoglenoid notches. On T1-weighted images the signal intensity of infraspinatus muscle was high in four cases but normal in the supraspinatus muscle in all cases. On T2-weighted images the signal intensity of infraspinatus muscle was high in six cases, and that for supraspinatus muscle was high in one case. In two cases the high intensity of palsied muscles became normal after the palsy recovered. Magnetic resonance imaging is a useful examination of peripheral nerve palsy not only for the detection of ganglion cysts but also for assessing the stage of paralysis."

One of the consequences of a rotator cuff tear is articular instability with upward migration of the humeral head. The ensuing chronic friction against the undersurface of the acromioclavicular joint caused by arm movements can lead to a non-inflammatory effusion of the acromioclavicular joint with cyst formation. Clinical and ultrasonographic features and a pathogenetic hypothesis are discussed.

CD009020,0,9599823,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of the supraspinatus tendon: the significance of signal intensity alterations at the 'critical zone'.,A pictorial essay of normal and abnormal appearances of the supraspinatus tendon is presented. An increased signal intensity within the supraspinatus tendon on short TE sequences is not necessarily abnormal. Increased signal seen within the tendon on modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) units is often due to a phenomenon known as the 'magic angle' effect. Only when supraspinatus tendon signal intensity is greater than that of muscle on long TE (T2) sequences should it be considered to be abnormal. The physical basis for the magic angle effect is outlined and a pictorial essay demonstrating the practical implications of this effect is presented. A comparison is made to signal intensity changes seen with partial and complete tears of the supraspinatus tendon. Correlation is made with important morphologic features of partial or complete tears.

CD009020,0,9586975,0,Primary traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation in patients 40 years of age and older.,"During three consecutive ski seasons (1991 to 1994), 125 patients 40 years of age and older without previous shoulder injuries or surgery sustained a traumatic first-time anterior shoulder dislocation. At a minimum of 2 years' follow-up, patients were contacted to determine long-term outcome and to identify factors leading to prolonged morbidity or the need for surgical intervention. Fifty-two patients were available for interview. A modified Rowe shoulder score showed 32 excellent, nine good, eight fair, and three poor results. Eighteen (35%) rotator cuff tears were subsequently identified, with only 11 (61%) of these patients obtaining an excellent or good outcome (P = .011). Of the 11 patients with a fair or poor result, seven (64%) had a rotator cuff tear. Of the 12 patients with isolated cuff tears, 84% had an excellent or good result when treated surgically, compared with 50% when treated nonsurgically. Our findings indicate that recurrence is not a frequent complication of traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation in this age-group (4%). However, prolonged morbidity secondary to rotator cuff tear is more prevalent than in a younger population. We believe early diagnosis of rotator cuff pathology by either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or arthrogram with subsequent surgical repair can lead to faster restoration of function and a better outcome in these select individuals."
CD009020,0,9581249,0,"Changes of sonographic, magnetic resonance tomographic, electromyographic, and histopathologic findings within a 2-month period of examinations after experimental muscle denervation.","This study compares sonographical, histopathological, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electromyographical (EMG) findings following acute muscle denervation. We performed an experimental denervation of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles on 35 New Zealand white rabbits by segment resection of the suprascapular nerve. The sonographical appearance of the supraspinatus muscle was followed and documented at short time intervals within a 2-month follow-up period. The sonographical, histopathological, and MRI changes due to denervation suggest a regular pattern. Apart from the reduction of the muscle diameter, there were considerable sonographical signs of denervation with an increase of echointensity and inhomogenicity of echotexture that appeared on day 14 after injury, and progressed continuously with time. MRI revealed a remarkable increase in signal intensity 3 weeks after denervation and reproducible T2 times. Pathological spontaneous activity on EMG could also be detected from day 14 after injury. Conventional histopathological staining methods (H&E, NADH, ATPase, basic and acid phosphatase) confirmed denervation and absence of reinnervation. The first nonspecific histopathological changes were seen 11 days after denervation in the form of moderately atrophic fibers. Typical histopathological signs of denervation appeared 3 weeks after nerve dissection. In summary, EMG, ultrasound, MRI, and histopathology each showed first abnormalities after about 2 weeks. In addition to EMG, sonography and MRI can document the course of muscle atrophy and mesenchymal abnormalities in neurogenic muscle lesions."

CD009020,0,9562818,0,[Imaging methods].,"A number of abnormalities of the shoulder joint can cause pain or dysfunction. Imaging of this complex joint is demanding. Standard radiographs are considered to represent the basis of all imaging. For more detailed diagnoses, especially concerning soft tissue, more advanced imaging methods are required. Standard arthrography (without combination with either CT or MRI) is rarely indicated anymore. Bone scintigraphy is another imaging method with limited use in shoulder joint abnormalities (neoplasm, infection, occult fracture). Sonography is useful in abnormalities of the rotator cuff and the biceps tendon. This method is commonly employed for screening. CT is useful in the demonstration of complex fractures. CT arthrography is indicated in instability of the glenohumeral joint and is competing with MR arthrography. MRI and MR arthrography are the imaging method of choice for many indications, mainly due to their free choice of imaging planes and excellent contrast resolution. These methods provide the most detailed diagnosis mainly with regard to abnormalities of the rotator cuff (partial versus intact or full-thickness tears) and the biceps tendon and are useful in the assessment of instability."

The frequency of positive MR-findings at the BT is approximately 25%. The pathologic alterations include complete medial luxation, subluxation and entrapment by the subscapularis tendon, tendinitis or tendovaginitis and lesions at the origin of the tendon at the superior labrum (superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP)--lesions). The imaging signs of BT pathology on MR include an abnormal course and position of the tendon, alterations in shape and changes in signal-intensity (SI), obliteration and thickening of the tendon-sheath. In long standing intra-articular BT rupture, neo-insertion of the tendon in the bicipital sulcus may ensue. The long BT needs to be visualized in transaxial, coronal oblique and sagittal oblique projections. Besides serving as stabilizer of the long head of biceps muscle, the BT is also an important stabilizer of the anterior joint capsule."
CD009020,0,9430826,0,Diagnosis of tears in rotator-cuff-injuries.,"Pathology of the rotator cuff is the cause of most common problems at the shoulder joint. Acute injuries are not as frequent as chronic cuff disease, but often they aggravate inflammatory or degenerative tendon alterations, even if they are of minor severity. Traumatic rotator cuff tears predominantly affect the supraspinatus tendon or the rotator interval. The subscapularis tendon is involved in anterior dislocations of the glenohumeral joint or in direct trauma. Plain film radiography still remains the base of all further imaging studies. If only full-thickness tears must be ruled out, double-contrast arthrography and ultrasound are acceptable imaging modalities. However, the former has a drawback in being invasive and does not detect partial tears at the bursal site of the cuff or rotator cuff tendinopathy, whereas the latter heavily depends on the experience of the radiologist and is restricted to the rotator cuff. Nowadays the most comprehensive imaging method is magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MR imaging enables the detection or exclusion of complete rotator cuff tears with a reasonable accuracy and is also suitable to diagnose further pathologies of the shoulder joint. MR arthrography is valuable in the detection of subtle anatomic details and further improves the differentiation of rotator cuff diseases. Although in comparison MR imaging is still the most expensive imaging method, its high negative predictive value for the diagnosis of complete rotator cuff tears and its reliability evaluating different shoulder joint pathologies make it the preferred imaging modality."

Standard radiographic, computed arthrotomographic, and MR findings in three baseball pitchers diagnosed with Bennett lesions of the shoulder are discussed. A crescent-shaped region of mineralization at the posteroinferior aspect of the glenoid rim, consistent with a Bennett lesion, arises at the insertion of the posterior joint capsule. The diagnosis of this lesion, typically in baseball pitchers, should raise suspicion for associated labral and rotator cuff abnormalities."

The supraspinatus tendon, which is the most frequently involved structure in rotator cuff tears, is studied with the patient's arm dropped, elbow extended and forearm prone. Our series consisted of 49 surgical patients (arthroscopy in 16 and open surgery in 33 patients): US sensitivity in tear depiction was 84.8%, specificity 100% and accuracy 89.8%. Medium-small tears appeared as transonic areas within tendon substance and/or tendon focal thinning. Large tears appeared as: (a) missed or markedly thinned rotator cuff, with deltoid muscle approximation to the humeral head surface, (b) plenty of fluid collected around bulky tear margins. The US images of 36 patients were then reviewed and the details discussed. A new sign was observed in medium-small tears, that is a sharp hyperechoic band encircling the humeral cartilage (the compass sign). In conclusion, we believe that US performed with the patient in supine recumbency is easier to perform and provides a bigger field of view of the supraspinatus tendon; it also permits to keep stretched rotator cuff, with consequent image quality improvement."
CD009020,0,9442331,0,Glenoid-labral cyst entrapping the suprascapular nerve: dissolution after arthroscopic debridement of an extended SLAP lesion.,"Glenoid labral cysts are commonly associated with labral tears, which can cause pain or instability. We present the case of a patient, referred for neurological complaints, who was actually suffering from supraspinatus nerve entrapment syndrome. Electroneurogram studies showed an isolated lesion of the branch to the infraspinatus muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a glenoid labral cyst extending from the cranial glenoid to the scapular notch. After arthroscopic debridement of an extended SLAP-lesion that had caused joint fluid extrusion, the dissolution of the cyst was associated with complete neurological recovery. The patient is pain free and range of motion is normal. An attempt at an arthroscopic procedure seems warranted in cases like this, since cysts that accompany labral tears can dissolve after rigorous debridement of the torn labrum, much like meniscal cysts. Extended and hazardous open excisions can thus be avoided."
CD009020,0,9442324,1,Magnetic resonance imaging assessment of the rotator cuff: is it really accurate?,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used increasingly for evaluating the rotator cuff. This study of 39 shoulders (38 patients) compared the accuracy of MRI interpretation of rotator cuff integrity by a group of community hospital radiologists (clinical community scenario, CCS) with that of a musculoskeletal radiologist (experienced specialist scenario, ESS), relative to arthroscopy. For the CCS subgroup, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PV), negative PV, and accuracy for partial tears were: 0%, 68%, 0%, 82%, and 59%, respectively; for complete tears: 56%, 73%, 36%, 86%, and 69%, respectively; and for all tears combined: 85%, 52%, 50%, 87%, and 64%, respectively.

We concluded that MRI assessment of the rotator cuff was not accurate relative to arthroscopy. MRI was most helpful if the result was negative, and MRI diagnosis of partial tear was of little value. Considering the high cost of shoulder MRI, this study has significant implications for the evaluation of patients with possible rotator cuff pathology."

A review.,"The recently introduced horizontally open configuration imagers allow imaging of knee, hip or shoulder during whole range of motion, which is not possible in conventional MR imagers. Special joint motion devices can be used to provide accurate and reproducible studies. In cervical spine, functional MR imaging may be useful in evaluating alarligament stability in patients with late sequelae of a whiplash injury, and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are clinically suspected of having a cervical myelopathy or superior migration of the odontoid process. In shoulder, full range of motion abduction study may be helpful in assessing the supraspinatus tendon impingement. To evaluate patellofemoral malalignment, quadriceps loading is recommended since associated contracting muscles and related soft tissue structures can be evaluated. The position of the femoral head relative to the acetabulum during different positions can be assessed.

CD009020,0,9372778,0,Prediction of rotator cuff repair results by magnetic resonance imaging.,"Thirty chronic rotator cuff tears were repaired consecutively and evaluated prospectively using a precise anatomic description of the tear that included the rotator interval, the Constant functional score, and an assessment of the tendon state and the atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle by preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Early correlations (mean followup, 21.1 months) attempted to define predictive factors of the final outcome of the repair, physical factors indicative of final tendon state, and postoperative evolution of supraspinatus atrophy. Magnetic resonance imaging oblique sagittal views showed that supraspinatus atrophy correlated with the sagittal and coronal extent of the tear and represented a strong predictive factor of postoperative retearing. At followup, 15 (50%) cuffs were continuous and thick, seven (23%) were continuous but thin, and six (20%) were retorn. Two (7%) cuffs had been repaired only partly. In the group with a persistent tear, flexion strength and differential Constant score were correlated with the final tendon state with no excellent or good results, and with less than 4 kg of strength. Supraspinatus atrophy improved in 18 of the 22 postoperative continuous cuffs, but never decreased in persistent tears, although there was pain relief and functional gain."
CD009020,0,9397454,0,MR arthrography of the shoulder: variants and pitfalls.,"Use of magnetic resonance arthrography to evaluate pathologic conditions of the shoulder is becoming widespread. However, normal anatomy or anatomic variations can cause interpretive errors. The most common variations occur at the origins of the glenohumeral ligaments (GHLs) and the insertion of the joint capsule. Among the GHL variants, common origin of the superior and middle ligaments is the most frequent followed by thinning, thickening, or absence of a ligament, most often the middle one. Absence or thinning of one ligament is sometimes associated with thickening of another or changes in the size and shape of the anterior capsular recesses. Common normal variants of the labrum include foramen sublabrum (detachment of the anterosuperior labrum from the glenoid margin) and the Buford complex (absence of the anterosuperior labrum in association with a thick middle GHL). Pitfalls related to the arthrographic technique include (a) visualization of a deep sulcus between the insertion of the long head of the biceps tendon and the superior labrum and (b) an apparent type III capsular insertion due to overdistention of the capsule by injected contrast material."
CD009020,0,9356936,0,Arthroscopic-assisted rotator cuff repair: patient selection and treatment outcome.,"Over a 4-year period 24 patients out of 376 who required a rotator cuff repair were selected for arthroscopic-assisted rotator cuff repair. Preoperative selection criteria were refractory pain in the setting of good range of motion and strength (after an impingement test), absence of radiographic superior humeral head translation, and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of minimally retracted tear without rotator cuff muscle atrophy. Intraoperative selection criteria were the findings of an avulsion-type tear configuration with good tendon quality and absence of subscapularis tendon involvement. Based on these intraoperative criteria, 7 of the 24 patients were converted to an open approach to mobilize retracted and friable tendon tissue in a complex tear configuration. The remaining 17 patients underwent a transosseous arthroscopic-assisted rotator cuff repair with an average postoperative follow-up of 23 months. Evaluation by an independent therapist determined the postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Function Index of 96 +/- 3 for the operative shoulder. The Functional Rating Scores for Activities of Daily Living and Sports Activity Score were 89% +/- 10% and 87% +/- 12%, respectively. Instrumented isometric strength for abduction and external rotation strength in the operated shoulder were 94% +/- 20% and 93% +/- 20%, respectively, compared with the contralateral unoperated side. Five of eight patients who performed overhead sports returned to a premorbid level of performance, and 14 of 15 patients available for follow-up believed that their result was excellent. We conclude that through careful selection one can identify patients optimally suited for arthroscopic-assisted rotator cuff repair, but some may have to be converted to an open end approach because of the quality of the tendon tissue and configuration of the tear requiring soft tissue releases."
CD009020,0,9356935,0,Suprascapular nerve entrapment caused by supraglenoid cyst compression.,"Twenty-two cases of suprascapular nerve entrapment caused by supraglenoid cyst compression were reviewed. Pain and weakness were the presenting symptoms in 14 shoulders and pain alone in 8. Twenty of the cysts were diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging, and two were confirmed at surgical exploration. Electromyography of 20 shoulders was positive for neurologic involvement for both the infraspinatus and supraspinatus in 4 cases, for the infraspinatus only in 12, and negative in 4. Sixteen shoulders were treated by open excision, arthroscopy, or both. Superior labral lesions were diagnosed in 11 of 12 patients who underwent arthroscopy. At follow-up 10 of the patients who underwent surgery had complete resolution of symptoms, 5 had occasional pain or weakness, and 1 recurrence required a second surgery. Of six patients treated without surgery, two improved and four had no change. Supraglenoid ganglion cysts are common and can easily be diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. For patients with symptoms arthroscopy with repair of the superior labral lesion and either arthroscopic debridement or direct open decompression and excision of the cyst is recommended."

CD009020,0,9376998,0,Sonography and MRI in the evaluation of painful arthritic shoulder.,"We evaluated 31 painful shoulders of 30 patients with chronic arthritis by ultrasonography (US) and compared the results with those of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both US and MRI revealed effusion in the subacromial-subdeltoid (SA-SD) bursa, biceps tendon sheath (BTS) and glenohumeral (GH) joint, but MRI was more accurate in depicting joint inflammation because of its ability to visualize synovial hypertrophy. US visualized biceps tendon ruptures equally well as MRI. MRI was better able to reveal full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon, whereas US showed better other changes of the supraspinatus tendon (degeneration or partial-thickness tear). Both of the imaging methods were able to depict erosions of the humeral head, but the locations occasionally differed. Inexpensive and easily available US can be recommended as the first imaging method for the detection of soft-tissue changes in the arthritic shoulder, but in rotator cuff problems both methods may be needed."
CD009020,0,9327536,0,Rotator cuff pathology in athletes.,"The rotator cuff is the primary dynamic stabiliser of the glenohumeral joint and is placed under significant stress during overhead and contact sports. Mechanisms of injury include repetitive microtrauma, usually seen in the athlete involved in overhand sports, and macrotrauma associated with contact sports. Rotator cuff injury and dysfunction in the overhand athlete may be classified based on aetiology as primary impingement, primary tensile overload, and secondary impingement and tensile overload resulting from glenohumeral instability. A thorough history and physical examination are paramount in the evaluation, classification and treatment planning of the athlete with rotator cuff pathology. Imaging studies are a helpful adjunct to the history and physical. Athletes with primary impingement are usually middle aged or older and often have chronic shoulder pain and sometimes weakness associated with overhand sporting activities. Night pain is typical of full thickness rotator cuff tears. Impingement signs are positive and strength of elevation and external rotation are often limited. They usually respond to a nonoperative rehabilitation programme centred on decreasing inflammation, restoring range of motion and strengthening the rotator cuff and scapular stabilisers. Depending on the degree of cuff pathology, acromioplasty, debridement of partial cuff tears, and repair of full thickness tears are usually successful in those who fail a rehabilitation programme. Overhand athletes with cuff pathology secondary to subtle anterior instability are usually young and complain of pain and decreased throwing velocity. Instability may be so subtle that it is only detectable through a positive relocation test on examination. The majority of these athletes do not have a Bankart lesion on magnetic resonance imaging or arthroscopic examination. Arthroscopic examination usually demonstrates anterior capsular laxity (positive 'drive-through' sign), as well as superior-posterior labral and cuff injury typical of internal impingement. If rehabilitation alone is not successful, a capsulolabral repair followed by rehabilitation may allow the athlete to return to their previous level of competition. The athlete with an acute episode of macrotrauma to the shoulder resulting in cuff pathology usually presents with pain, limited active elevation and a positive 'shrug sign'. Arthroscopy and debridement of thickened, inflamed or scarred subacromial bursa with cuff repair or debridement as indicated is usually successful in those who do not respond to a rehabilitation programme."
CD009020,0,9343659,0,Acromion-splitting approach through an os acromiale for repair of a massive rotator cuff tear.,"Os acromiale, failure of fusion of the secondary centers of ossification of the acromion process, has been noted as a contributing factor in shoulder impingement syndrome and rotator cuff tears. Treatments for symptomatic os acromiale with or without rotator cuff tears have been reported in the literature and range from excision of small fragments to fusion of larger, fragments with internal fixation and bone grafting. Generally, rotator cuff repairs have been performed when possible. We report an acromion splitting approach through an existing os acromiale to gain exposure for the repair of a massive rotator cuff tear. Subsequent to this repair, the acromion was repaired with internal fixation. Good functional use of the patient's upper extremity was obtained and the patient expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome. The acromion splitting approach is a viable approach in patients with an os acromiale and a coexistent rotator cuff tear."

Factors responsible for limiting the use of MR imaging are its relatively high cost, as well as its insensitivity to diminished osseous mineralization and subtle areas of calcification or hyperostosis. MR imaging findings of some arthropathies, however--such as synovial osteochondromatosis, PVNS, and amyloid arthropath--are highly characteristic, and help in determining both diagnosis and treatment.

MR imaging allows direct examination of the thickness, signal characteristics, and continuity of the rotator cuff. Furthermore, MR imaging can be used not only to determine the status of the cuff, but also to detect pathology involving surrounding structures and to identify anatomic variations that may contribute to the impingement. Rapid MR imaging during active unguided shoulder motion will likely further increase our understanding of the biomechanics of the shoulder at different stages of impingement, and may shed further light on the pathogenesis of this disorder."

CD009020,0,9285996,0,MR arthrography of the rotator cuff and labral-ligamentous complex.,"In MR imaging of the shoulder, diagnostic success requires the delineation of complex anatomic structures and the demonstration of subtle abnormalities. Magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography extends the capabilities of conventional MR imaging because contrast solution separates intra-articular structures and outlines abnormalities. There are several major contributions of MR arthrography. In assessment of the rotator cuff, arthrographic MR images enable the accurate differentiation of full-thickness tears from other cuff abnormalities, as well as the determination of tendon quality. In shoulders with suspected glenohumeral instability, arthrographic MR images show the locations of labral tears relative to the origins of glenohumeral ligaments. This article illustrates normal arthrographic MR features of the shoulder as well as common pathological disorders of the rotator cuff and labral-ligamentous complex."
CD009020,0,9424648,0,[Subacromial impingement syndrome and rotator cuff tear. Ultrasonography of 140 cases].,"We investigated the role of rotator cuff impingement in causing tears of supraspinatus and biceps tendons and the comparative reliability of plain radiography and sonography (US). One hundred forty patients with symptoms referrable to the rotator cuff were examined with plain radiography and US of the shoulder. US findings were correlated with MR or double contrast arthrography results in 10 patients and 39 patients were submitted to surgery (acromionplasty). Radiographic studies were performed first and diagnosed rotator cuff impingement (63 patients) caused by abnormal acromial margins or size (23 patients), by acromioclavicular joint protrusion (17 patients), by anterior acromial osteophytosis (10 patients), or by massive periarthritic calcifications (13 patients). In the same 140 patients. US showed normal cuffs in 46 cases, tendonitis in 34, calcific tendonitis in 13, partial-thickness cuff tears in 13, full-thickness cuff tears in 20 and biceps tendon tears in 14 cases. Six of 13 partial tears were studied with MRI, with 4 true positives and 2 false positives. US diagnosis was confirmed by arthrography in 4 complete tears. Twenty-nine of 39 patients undergoing acromionplasty were examined only with plain radiography and US. US accurately diagnosed all 20 massive full-thickness tears, with no false positives nor false negatives (US versus surgery and arthrography). Eleven true positives, 2 false positives and no false negative were observed in 13 partial-thickness cuff tears (US versus surgery and MRI). These findings suggest that rotator cuff US and plain radiography are easily performed, reproducible routine examinations to study the whole rotator cuff and the acromioclavicular joint in the many patients who need an accurate, safe, painless, rapid and cost-effective differential diagnosis, leaving it up to the surgeon to consider MRI or arthrography. Rotator cuff impingement tendonitis, overuse or calcific tendonitis, partial-thickness cuff tears and full-thickness tears ranging from light to severe cause similar shoulder pain and weakness on arm raising. The differential diagnosis must distinguish all these common causes of shoulder dysfunction and cuff problems from other conditions. We conclude that US and plain radiography are accurate routine tests of rotator cuff integrity and rotator cuff impingement."

CD009020,0,9243387,0,Comparison of fat-saturation fast spin echo versus conventional spin-echo MRI in the detection of rotator cuff pathology.,The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of fat-saturation fast-spin-echo (FSE) T2-weighted (T2W) sequences with conventional spin-echo (CSE) T2W sequences in the detection of rotator cuff pathology using surgery as the reference standard. Oblique coronal dual-echo CSE and FSE T2W images with fat saturation from 50 surgically confirmed MR shoulder examinations were acquired on a 1.5-T MR scanner. Blinded MR readers retrospectively analyzed each imaging sequence separately and ultimately correlated both sequences together with findings at surgery. FSE was 100% sensitive and 94% specific in detection of full-thickness tears (n = 19) and 73% sensitive and 97% specific in the detection of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears (n = 13). There was no statistically significant difference in the performance of FSE with fat saturation compared with CSE. The two discrepancies between imaging sequences related to the extent of partial-thickness tears. Our findings suggest that fat-saturation FSE imaging can effectively replace CSE imaging in the evaluation of rotator cuff pathology.

CD009020,0,9219130,0,The low incidence of suprascapular nerve injury after primary repair of massive rotator cuff tears.,"We measured the incidence of cuff retear and injury to the suprascapular nerve after mobilization and repair of a massive rotator cuff tear. Of one hundred four rotator cuff repairs performed over a 5-year period, 10 patients (7 men and 3 women, age range 22 to 68 years) had primary repairs of massive rotator cuff tears requiring cuff mobilization and an acromioplasty as their only procedure. These patients were evaluated at a mean of 2.5 years (range 2.0 to 3.0 years) after surgery. At follow-up electromyographic examination confirmed that 1 of the 10 patients had an iatrogenic suprascapular nerve injury, whereas ultrasound evaluation revealed that 2 of 10 repairs failed. Pain relief was achieved in the eight patients with intact repairs and not in the two with recurrent tears. All patients had some limitation of active motion or strength, especially in external rotation. Thus 7 of 10 patients had neither evidence of nerve injury nor recurrent rotator cuff tears yet still showed limited active motion or weakness. It appears that operative injury to the suprascapular nerve during cuff mobilization can occur, but other factors such as inadequate cuff muscle function are more frequently responsible for the poor functional outcomes seen after successful repairs of massive rotator cuff tears."

Seventy-four patients, aged 21-64 years, were examined to compare ultrasonography (US) results with surgical findings in supraspinatus conditions and to analyze the possible pitfalls in US diagnosis. All the patients underwent conventional X-ray, US and then surgery or arthroscopy. The following criteria were considered: morphology, thickness, echotexture, the convexity of the superior border of supraspinatus tendon, the relationships with the subacromial bursa and the tendon of the biceps long head, the regularity of the bone cortex of the humeral head. US showed: chronic degenerative tendinopathy in 10 patients; perforating focal injuries in 21 patients; deep focal injuries in 10 patients; intramural focal injuries in 6 patients; superficial focal injuries in 8 patients; complete tendon tear with detachment in 19 cases. 62/74 US diagnoses were surgically confirmed, with a specificity of 83.7%.

CD009020,0,9127074,0,Cyclic loading of transosseous rotator cuff repairs: tension overload as a possible cause of failure.,"Previous experimental studies of failure of rotator cuff repair have involved a single pull to ultimate load. Such an experimental design does not represent the cyclic loading conditions experienced in vivo. We created 1 cm x 2 cm rotator cuff defects in 16 cadaver shoulders, repaired each defect with transosseous simple sutures, and cyclically loaded the repairs by a servohydraulic materials test system actuator at physiologic rates and loads (rate of 33 mm/sec to a load of 180 N.). A progressive gap was noted in each specimen, for a 100% rate of failure of the repairs. A 5 mm gap developed at an average of 25 cycles, and a 10 mm gap developed at an average of 188 cycles. The central suture always failed first and by the largest magnitude. This study suggests that rotator cuff tears that are repaired with a ""tension overload"" of a portion of the muscle-tendon units will undergo gradual failure with physiologic cyclic loading until the normal resting lengths of the muscle-tendon units are restored. This ""controlled failure"" of the repairs may explain residual defects that have been demonstrated by ultrasonography and by arthrography in patients with ""successful"" rotator cuff repairs. Clinical implications are that: 1) rotator cuff tears should be repaired without tension if possible; and 2) transosseous bone tunnels should ideally extend distal to the weak metaphysical bone so that purchase is obtained into cortical bone for greater fixation strength."

This study evaluated the performance of the FSE technique in comparison with the established CSE technique as a reference standard. Oblique coronal images of 30 shoulders were obtained by both FSE and CSE techniques. The FSE images were compared with CSE images in terms of blurring and motion artifact, fat signal intensity, structural conspicuity, and visualization of joint effusion and rotator cuff tears. We imaged 30 consecutive patients with suspected rotator cuff tears who were referred for MR examination. FSE images often were worse in blurring and motion artifact than CSE images. FSE images showed higher fat signal intensity, but visualized structural conspicuity, joint effusion, and rotator cuff tear as well as CSE images. Our results suggest that the FSE technique is not equal to the CSE technique but can be used for the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears."

The majority of the 100 patients (60 women, 40 men) were older than 60 years of age. The dominant fracture type according to AO was type A. Operative stabilization was considered indicate because of fracture distraction during functional bracing in most cases. In general, patients choose surgical intervention in preference to conservative management. Radiological consolidation was observed within 10 weeks. In 48 cases sonography revealed motor disturbances between the gliding sheath of the rotator cuff, but there was no correlation between this and the shoulder mobility. In 7 cases an additional fracture was created during introduction of the nail. This complication can be avoided by using the right technique. There were no cases of non-union or radial nerve lesion. There were 2 patients who developed an infection, which disappeared after removal of the nail and introduction of antibiotic-loaded beads. Functional results were recorded in 63 patients: 53 patients (84%) had an excellent or satisfactory result (NEER score > 80). Among the others, problems at the site of nail insertion predominated. In our view, the Seidel humeral locking nail is an implant that provides exercise stability without intraoperative positioning problems or risk of injury to nerves or vessels.

CD009020,0,9266041,0,Sonography and MRI of experimental muscle injuries.,"After sonographical examination with a 7.5-MHz linear array scanner, we created an experimental muscle injury of known site and location on 28 New Zealand white rabbits by stabbing them with a scalpel in the supraspinatus muscle. The changes in the healing process were followed and documented by sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and 2, 5, 11, 14, 36 and 64 days after injury. The changes in sonography and MRI followed a regular course. Ultrasound revealed an echo-poor area after injury with ever increasing echogenicity from the 14th day. Strong reflexes were found after 2 months. MRI showed few changes, only a slight increase of signal intensity, but a characteristic curve of calculated T2-times (a program of the MRI software). The interpretation of the sonographical picture in histopathological terms remained limited. The development of a hematoma and of fibrous scars can be followed up by sonography, but it is not possible to determine the point of time after injury very accurately. Nevertheless, sonography is a method of great value in the diagnosis of muscle injuries and, given certain limits, in the follow-up of the healing process, too. The significance of MRI can be increased by calculations with the implemented software, as in our study calculated T2-times produced a characteristic curve reflecting the shift of fluids after muscle injury."
CD009020,0,9239637,0,Anatomy of the normal acromion investigated using MRI.,"The shape of the acromion is strongly associated with impingement syndrome and with rotator cuff tears. It is notoriously difficult to image the acromion with conventional radiography. We have developed MRI techniques to depict the acromion in its longitudinal axis. Furthermore, we have measured the subacromial space in both external and internal rotation. In previous studies, three types of acromial shape have been described with the type III or hooked acromion being present in 66% of cases with rotator cuff tears. We studied 31 normal shoulders in 29 people using MRI. Within this population aged 24-36 years, mean age 31 years, no type III acromions were found. Twenty-one were type I (67.7%) and 10 were type II (32.3%). In addition, we found no difference in subacromial height in external or internal rotation. Low rates of intra- and interobserver error were found. These results imply that the hooked acromion is not present in the normal population and is, therefore, likely to be an acquired abnormality."
CD009020,0,9064794,0,[Sonography of the musculoskeletal system].,"Beside standard radiographs, bone scintigraphy and MR imaging, ultrasonography plays an important role in assessing abnormalities of the musculoskeletal system. Ultrasonography is widely available, inexpensive and provides high-contrast resolution; however, interobserver variability is a major problem. Ultrasonography should only be employed by experienced examiners and for proven indications in order to prevent inadequate results. Most peer-reviewed publications have evaluated the role of ultrasonography for abnormalities of the rotator cuff and the achilles tendon. Ultrasonography also commonly provides useful information in hip, knee, foot, and wrist abnormalities as well as in the initial work-up in suspected infection or neoplasm; moreover, the role of ultrasonography in some less accepted indications is discussed, such as in meniscal and cruciate ligament injuries as well as in Morton's neuroma."
CD009020,0,9040149,0,Magnetic resonance imaging features of chloroma of the shoulder.,A patient with a history of essential thrombocytosis presented with diffuse skeletal pain and restricted motion of the left shoulder. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left glenohumeral joint showed a soft tissue mass that displaced the rotator cuff. Biopsy of the mass revealed chloroma. MRI is the method that best characterizes this lesion.
CD009020,0,9038113,0,Diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions: comparison of US and MRI on 38 joint specimens.,"An experimental study was performed on cadaveric joint specimens of the shoulder to determine the accuracy of US and MRI in diagnosis of abnormalities of the rotator cuff. The value of different morphological criteria was evaluated for discrimination of degeneration as well as partial and complete disruption. A total of 38 surgically exposed specimens of the shoulder joint were examined by US, MRI and pathological methods visualising the tendons of the rotator cuff in same axial and longitudinal orientations. The three imaging modalities were reviewed separately by experienced examiners, respectively, who were blind to other results. Evaluation criteria consisted of signs of shape (thinning, thickening, discontinuity and absence of rotator cuff) and structure (changes in echogenicity in US, increased signal intensity in MRI, tissue changes in pathology). Findings in US and MRI were finally compared with pathology to assess sensitivity and specificity. Pathology demonstrated 4 full-thickness tears, 6 partial-thickness tears, 16 cases with degeneration and 12 normal rotator cuffs. Ultrasound showed pathological signs in all abnormal cuffs, and one MRI report was false negative. Specificity was 67 % in US (4 of 12 cases were false positive) and 100 % in MRI (no abnormal findings in healthy tendons). Discrimination of different pathological disorders of the rotator cuff was reduced in both methods. Using US only 10 of 16 cases of degeneration, 2 of 6 partial tears and 3 of 4 complete tears were correctly defined. Using MRI 13 of 16 degenerations, 3 of 6 partial tears and 3 of 4 complete tears were detected. The MRI technique failed to visualise intratendinous calcifications in all 3 cases. We conclude that MRI and US are both sensitive in detection of abnormalities of the rotator cuff. Ultrasound should be the primary diagnostic method in screening of shoulder pain because it is economic and fast. The MRI technique should be used secondary because it provides more information about extent of tendons and has lower risk of artefacts."

Evaluation and treatment of subscapularis tears and principles of treatment for supraspinatus tears.,"Successful surgical treatment of single-tendon tears, which involve the supraspinatus or the subscapularis requires careful attention to technical details. In supraspinatus tears, careful mobilization and secure repair of the tendon will usually give a good outcome. In subscapularis tears, the diagnosis is not difficult if one carefully evaluates the patient for the classic pathognomonic findings of such a tear. If the tear is confirmed by CT or MR imaging and an acute repair is performed, the outcome is usually satisfactory."

CD009020,0,9006686,0,"Traumatic tears of the subscapularis tendon. Clinical diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and operative treatment.","The study population consisted of 14 shoulders in 13 consecutive patients with surgically confirmed isolated subscapularis tendon tears. In all but three patients, the mechanism of injury was traumatic hyperextension or external rotation of the abducted arm. All patients reported pain and weakness in the affected shoulder. Physical findings revealed limited passive range of motion at maximal internal and external rotation due to pain, weakness of internal rotation of the shoulder, and tenderness in the region of the intertubercular groove. However, these findings did not conclusively point to the subscapularis tendon as the site of injury. Preoperative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging studies was used to diagnose tears of the subscapularis tendon in 14 shoulders and biceps tendon subluxation or dislocation in 6 shoulders. On arthroscopic examination, one patient was found to have a partial-thickness tear that was treated with arthroscopic debridement. Six shoulders had full-thickness tears of the subscapularis tendon, and seven shoulders had full-thickness tears associated with concomitant biceps tendon pathologic conditions, including subluxation, dislocation, or rupture. The full-thickness subscapularis tendon tears were repaired via an open anterior approach to the shoulder through the deltopectoral groove. Associated biceps tendon injuries were treated with tenodesis of the tendon to the intertubercular groove. Our early followup results have shown that, with proper diagnoses and surgical treatments, patients have greatly decreased pain and marked improvement in shoulder function."
CD009020,0,9005933,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of the musculoskeletal system. Part 6. The Shoulder.,"The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with shoulder pain has increased remarkably in recent years, largely because of improved resolution of images and increased experience of musculoskeletal radiologists. In rotator cuff disease/impingement and instability, magnetic resonance imaging adds a new dimension to the clinical findings through the noninvasive visualization of either the pathology itself or frequently associated abnormalities. It is the associated abnormalities that are depicted in instability: glenoid irregularities, labral tears, capsular laxity, and Hill-Sachs deformities. Glenoid, labral, and Hill-Sachs abnormalities can be assessed with either magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography arthrography. Magnetic resonance imaging has the advantages of noninvasiveness, multiplanar imaging capability and exquisite soft tissue contrast. In rotator cuff disease, magnetic resonance imaging depicts the status of the rotator cuff itself, revealing partial and full thickness tears, allowing an estimation of size and quality of tendon edges. Possible impingement sites can be identified. Primary instability with secondary impingement may be first suspected on magnetic resonance imaging. Postoperative complications, including recurrent tendon detachment, deltoid dehiscence, and infection, are clarified. Unsuspected but clinically important lesions, such as neoplasm, osteonecrosis, and ganglion with entrapment of the suprascapular nerve, each have characteristic magnetic resonance imaging appearances."
CD009020,0,8998210,0,MR imaging of shoulder impingement and rotator cuff disease.,"A number of imaging modalities, such as conventional radiography, arthrography, ultrasonography, and MR imaging, can be used in the evaluation of shoulder pain related to impingement, tendinosis, and rotator cuff tear. Of these techniques, only MR imaging provides anatomic information coupled with superior soft-tissue contrast. MR imaging of the shoulder effectively demonstrates a variety of morphologic abnormalities that may be associated with tendon degeneration. Rotator cuff tears are also well depicted and may be further characterized with regard to tendon involvement, degree of retraction, and secondary muscular atrophy."
CD009020,0,9115565,0,Arthroscopic decompression of a ganglion cyst causing suprascapular nerve compression.,"Ganglion cysts causing suprascapular nerve compression are an uncommon cause of suprascapular nerve compression. The advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its application in patients with shoulder pain has improved the ability to diagnose cystic lesions causing extrinsic compression of the suprascapular nerve. Traditionally, treatment of suprascapular nerve compression by a ganglion cyst has required open cyst excision through either a deltoid and infraspinatus muscle takedown or a muscle splitting approach. We present three cases of suprascapular nerve compression by a ganglion cyst in which the cyst was decompressed arthroscopically. In each case the patient's symptoms resolved after arthroscopic cyst decompression, and a postoperative MRI does not demonstrate reaccumulation of the cyst fluid. Arthroscopic ganglion cyst decompression is a well-tolerated approach to this problem that avoids the morbidity of an open surgical procedure. The absence of recurrent cyst formation combined with resolution of the symptoms attests to the success of this method."
CD009020,0,9101759,0,[A dynamic shoulder model for biomechanical measurements of shoulder specimen].,"The article discusses a dynamic shoulder model capable of simulating the forces generated by the rotator cuff and the deltoid muscle, and elevation movements of the glenohumeral joint using, a computer-aided servohydraulic unit. In 10 cadaver shoulder specimen, the effects of the loss of function of the supraspinatus muscle on maximum elevation was determined with an ultrasound system. Changes in the so-called impingement pressure below the coracoacromial arch were determined with the aid of capacitive pressure sensors. With the supraspinatus muscle inactive/ absent, the maximum elevation of the humerus showed a decrease of 6% (p < 0.05), which, however, was overcome by an increase in deltoid power of only one-third of the supraspinatus muscle power loss. For a simulated isolated supraspinatus defect, the subacromial pressure below the coracoacromial arch decreased by 8% (p > 0.05). These results confirm clinical investigations showing that isolated lesions affecting the supraspinatus tendon often fail to produce symptoms and thus require no surgical reconstruction."
CD009020,0,9082479,0,[Ultrasound diagnosis of the shoulder].,"Sonography of the shoulder joint is a well-established technique in the hands of the experienced examiner, when using a standardized protocol. It has proved invaluable in assessing pathological soft tissue changes, especially after trauma. The static evaluation of anatomy and dynamic assessment of function are especially helpful in both preoperative staging and postoperative follow-up. The normal anatomy, examination techniques, including our own variations, and pathological conditions are discussed. The findings and various classifications of impingement syndrome, rotator cuff injuries, biceps tendon lesions and inflammatory changes are examined. Review of the major articles in the literature shows excellent correlation with our results, the overall sensitivity in the case of rotator cuff lesions being over 90%. A well-performed ultrasound examination in most cases obviates the need for the more invasive arthroscopy and the more cumbersome and expensive MRI examinations."
CD009020,0,9082478,0,[MR arthrography of the shoulder joint in a postoperative patient sample].,"Indications of MR arthrography were analyzed in this prospective study. The aim was to evaluate possible advantages over conventional MRI, establish diagnostic criteria and to analyze its meaning further for the therapeutic management of postoperative patients. MR arthrography was performed in eight patients who had undergone surgical repair of rotator cuff lesions (modified Neer acromioplasty) and in six patients who had undergone arthroscopic therapy of recurrent unidirectional dislocation of the shoulder by combined arthroscopic intra- and extracapsular repair. MR investigations were performed before and after application of a contrast solution (2 mmol Gd-DTPA). All patients suffered from chronic postoperative pain. In patients with rotator cuff lesions, a partial tear could be verified in one patient and excluded in all others. In patients after arthroscopic therapy by combined intra- and extracapsular repair, a radiologically patulous-appearing capsule correlated with clinically recurrent dislocations. In all other patients diagnostic criteria, such as distribution of the intra-articular contrast solution, proliferation of scar tissue, nodular appearance of the glenohumeral ligaments and capsule thickness, correlated with a regular postoperative status. MR arthrography of the shoulder represents a promising method in the evaluation of the postoperative shoulder. It might further improve the evaluation of reactive capsule alterations, scar tissue proliferation, and the labroligamentous complex, as well as the ability to differentiate partial and complete rerupture from degenerative changes of the rotator cuff."

CD009020,0,9082475,0,[Diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome].,"This article reviews the pathogenesis and clinical and imaging findings in shoulder impingement syndrome. Shoulder impingement is caused by compression of the supraspinatus tendon underneath the coracoacromial arch, mainly in forward flexion of the arm. Different stages of impingement syndrome are described. Stage I relates to edema and hemorrhage of the supraspinatus tendon. Stage II is characterized by bursal inflammation and fibrosis, as well as tendinopathy. In stage III there is a tear of the rotator cuff. Clinical signs may overlap. Moreover, calcifying tendinitis, fractures and pain originating from the cervical spine may mimic shoulder impingement syndrome. Imaging is important for the exact diagnosis. Standard radiographs are the basis of imaging in shoulder impingement syndrome. They may demonstrate subchondral sclerosis of the major tuberosity, subacromial spurs, and form anomalies of the acromion. They are also important in the differential diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome and demonstrate calcifying tendinitis, fractures and neoplasm. Ultrasonography has found acceptance as a screening tool and even as a final diagnostic method by many authors. However, there is a high interobserver variability in the demonstration of rotator cuff tears. Its usefulness has therefore been questioned. MR imaging is probably the method of choice in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and surrounding structures. Several investigations have demonstrated that differentiation of early findings, such as tendinopathy versus partial tears, may be difficult with MR imaging. However, reproducibility for fullthickness tears appears to be higher than for sonography. Moreover, specificity appears to be superior to sonography. MR arthrography is not universally accepted. However, it allows for more exact differentiation of discrete findings and may be indicated in preoperative planning. Standard arthrography and CT have a limited role in the current assessment of the rotator cuff."

We reviewed 39 patients with partial-thickness rotator cuff tears who underwent acromioplasty, debridement of the abnormal tissue, and tendon suturing. Follow-up averaged 55 months (range 13 to 132 months). Twenty-three (59%) patients had an excellent result, 10 (26%) patients had a satisfactory result, and 6 (15%) patients had an unsatisfactory result. Four of the six patients with unsatisfactory results had also had unsuccessful previous surgery. Thirty-five (90%) patients rated their response to surgery as either much improved or improved. No complications occurred, and to date no reoperations have been required. Diagnosis of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears can be challenging. Magnetic resonance imaging supplies the most complete information about tendon structure. Conservative treatment is reasonable for most partial-thickness tears. When surgical treatment is indicated, acromioplasty, debridement, and tendon repair are effective."

Conventional radiographs (internal and external rotation and outlet and axillary views) on eight patients showed ossification of the coracoacromial ligament. Rotator cuff integrity was assessed by physical examination in all 8 patients, by arthrography in 3 patients, and by MRI in 2 patients. Surgery was performed on four of the patients. Physical examination showed impingement findings and decreased rotator cuff strength suggestive of rotator cuff disease in all eight patients. The arthrograms and MRI examinations showed the presence of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Four of these patients underwent surgery and the rotator cuff defects were confirmed and repaired. Identification of ossification of the CAL on conventional radiographs should be recognized as strongly suggestive of associated significant rotator cuff pathology."

The introduction of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging has enabled a significantly better assessment of soft parts and of the inner spatial structure of the joints. Hence, focus of diagnosis has now shifted from the assessment of the bones (which was previously the main aspect of diagnosis) to a different analysis of the joint as a functional unit of bone and soft part structures, an analysis that can also detect subtle changes such as additive micro-traumas.

Relationship to operative findings.,"We used magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate thirty shoulders in twenty-nine patients who had unacceptable pain and loss of function after at least one operative procedure for a lesion of the rotator cuff. A preoperative history was recorded and physical and radiographic examinations were performed before magnetic resonance imaging. All patients had a reoperation two to 156 months (average, thirty-two months) after the operation. The results of the magnetic resonance imaging and the findings at the most recent operation were then compared with regard to the integrity of the rotator cuff, the deltoid muscle, and the long head of the biceps tendon. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of full-thickness tears, partial-thickness tears, and intact rotator cuffs were 84 and 91 per cent, 83 and 83 per cent, and 80 and 100 per cent, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 94 and 77 per cent, 56 and 95 per cent, and 100 and 96 per cent, respectively. Three shoulders had a clinically detached and retracted origin of the deltoid muscle that was identified correctly on magnetic resonance imaging, and this finding was confirmed operatively. A rupture of the long head of the biceps tendon was identified correctly in four of six shoulders. In one of the two remaining shoulders, the rupture was obscured on magnetic resonance imaging because of a so-called balloon artefact from a nearby metal suture anchor. Magnetic resonance imaging detected two unexpected lesions: a denudation of the articular cartilage in one shoulder and a ganglion cyst in the supraspinatus muscle in another."

The calcified subacromial-subdeltoid bursa has a characteristic appearance on plain radiographs. When inflamed it can be visualized by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Calcific bursitis may involve the subcoracoid bursa. This bursa may mimic adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder or complete rotator cuff tear when injected inadvertently during shoulder arthrography.

The aim of the study was to recognize characteristic findings of the calcific deposits and their relation to the involved tendons as well as the coincidence with additional degenerative alterations of the rotator cuff. The calcifications can be demonstrated with high accuracy (> 95%) in T1-weighted images as areas of decreased signal intensity. It is possible to characterize the calcifications similar to Gärtner's radiologic classification differentiating form and density of the calcific deposits as well as their delimitation to the tendon structure. In T2-images there frequently is a perifocal band of increased signal intensity which can be identified as an oedema around the calcification. Analysing two perpendicular planes the calcifications can be assigned to the corresponding anatomical structure. 83 percent were located in the supraspinatus tendon above the humeral head or in the superior part of the subscapularis tendon. Degenerative areas of the rotator cuff are demonstrated as small zones of increased signal intensity, abnormal morphology or discontinuity of the tendon. Only in one patient a partial tear could be found; 11 percent showed variable signs of degenerative alteration of the involved tendon."

The aim was to evaluate any relation between calcifying tendinitis and subacromial impingement. A total of 83% of the calcifications were located in the supraspinatus or the adjoining part of the subscapularis tendon. On T1-weighted images they could be demonstrated with high accuracy as areas of decreased signal intensity. A magnetic resonance imaging categorization of the calcium deposits was carried out by means of a differentiation of form, outline, and density. A partial rotator cuff tear was found in one shoulder; in 11% variable aspects of degenerative alteration of the affected tendon were seen. By analysis of the radiographic outlet view 16% of the cases had a type III acromion.

As pathognomonic clinical signs of these lesions are often lacking, noninvasive imaging techniques are practical and valuable. In this report the anatomy of this tendon is described, correlating with sonographic images.

CD009020,0,8698718,0,Isolated rupture of the subscapularis tendon.,"Sixteen consecutive patients were managed operatively for repair of an isolated traumatic rupture of the subscapularis tendon in the absence of avulsion of the lesser tuberosity. All of the patients were men. The diagnosis was made for each patient on the basis of the clinical examination and was confirmed by imaging studies and operative exploration. The operative treatment consisted of mobilization of the subscapularis after exploration and protection of the axillary nerve, transosseous reinsertion of the tendon to a trough created at the lesser tuberosity, closure of the rotator interval, and protection of the shoulder for six weeks postoperatively. The average duration of follow-up was forty-three months (range, twenty-four to eighty-four months). Thirteen patients subjectively rated the result as excellent or good. The average functional score of the shoulder, as assessed according to the system of Constant, was 82 per cent of the average age and gender-matched normal value. Active flexion was normal in twelve patients, was decreased by 15 degrees or less in three, and was severely limited in one patient. The capacity of the patients to work in their original occupations had increased from an average of 59 per cent of full capacity preoperatively to an average of 95 per cent postoperatively (p = 0.006). Operative treatment proved to be economically sound within the Swiss National Accident Insurance system. The quality of the result did not depend on the capacity for work at the time of the operation, on the type of work in which the patient was engaged, on the state of the biceps, or on the duration of follow-up. Conversely, the results were less successful when there was an increased delay from the time of the injury to the time of the operative repair."
CD009020,0,8677829,0,Rotator cuff disorders.,"The supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapuĺaris muscles form a musculotendinous rotator cuff that provides dynamic stability to the shoulder joint. Symptoms of rotator cuff injury include limitation of motion, weakness and pain that often radiates down the upper arm and is present at night. Examination may reveal deltoid and rotator cuff atrophy, tenderness, limited passive range of motion and weakness on abduction and external rotation. Radiographs may show degenerative changes of the acromion or acromioclavicular joint, cysts, sclerosis and spurs of the greater tuberosity, and calcific deposits within the supraspinatus tendon. In most patients with subacromial impingement, conservative management, including physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and subacromial injections, is successful. Failure of conservative therapy after six to 12 weeks merits further evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging or arthrography, and consideration of surgery."

All three were over 60 years old and presented with a massive rupture of the rotator cuff with a subnormal range of passive motion; active motion was variably affected and was painful. The patients underwent resection of one cm of the lateral end of the clavicle, together with resection of the cyst and synovectomy of the upper part of the pathologic humero-acromial joint; the coraco-acromial ligament was left in place. With a mean follow-up of 26 months, the 3 patients have significant pain relief and no cyst has recurred. The authors propose a mechanism to explain the persistence of the cysts in patients with massive rotator cuff tear: elevation of the arm brings the humeral head upwards and forces synovial fluid into the acromioclavicular joint through a perforation in the frayed capsule; this communication is later obstructed by synovial fringes which prevent drainage of the fluid. Excision of the synovium cures the problem."

It allowed a reliable measurement of supraspinatus muscle atrophy by the calculation of the occupation ratio (R) which is the ratio between the surface of the cross-section of the muscle belly and that of the fossa. This ratio was calculated in a prospective study based on 55 shoulders divided into 3 groups with different rotator cuff status: group I, 15 controls; group II, 10 degenerative cuffs, without tears; group III, 30 operated tears. There was no difference between groups I (mean ratio 0.7) and II (mean ratio 0.62), but the ratio was decreased in group III (mean ratio 0.44), in which the extent of the tear in both the sagittal and coronal planes aggravated the muscle atrophy. We propose a three-stage classification to improve indications for rotator cuff tear treatment."

CD009020,0,8816343,0,Subscapularis tendon disruption after Bankart reconstruction for anterior instability.,"After undergoing a Bankart repair with a subscapularis tendon and capsular incising technique, four patients were identified who had failure of their subscapularis tendon repair. All had a traumatic event or injury to their shoulder between 1 day and 4 months after operation. The patients presented with findings including recurrent instability, weakness in internal rotation, an abnormal liftoff test, and increased external rotation of the affected extremity. Surgical exploration demonstrated failure of the Bankart repair in two cases in addition to failure of the subscapularis tendon repair in all four. In one patient magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic of subscapularis tendon disruption. After reoperation was performed, stability was achieved in three of four patients, return of normal internal rotation strength in two, and a normal liftoff test in two. Prompt reexploration and repair of the subscapularis tendon-capsule complex is recommended."
CD009020,0,8710459,0,[Use of oblique sagittal T2-weighted images in diagnosing rotator cuff tears].,"The correlation between oblique sagittal T2-weighted images and oblique coronal T2-weighted images was determined in 86 patients who had symptoms and signs suggesting rotator cuff tears. Abnormal high signal lesions suggesting full and partial thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon were observed on the oblique coronal images in 20 and 27 of 86 patients, respectively. The oblique sagittal images showed the lesions just the same as the oblique coronal images. In the other 39, abnormal high signal lesions were not observed on oblique coronal images or on oblique sagittal images. The oblique sagittal images were proved not useful to detect tears of the supraspinatus tendon. However, the oblique sagittal T2-weighted images showed posterior extension of high signal lesions and clarified abnormal high signal lesions near the long head of the biceps tendon in two patients. These results suggested that oblique coronal images should always be taken at the first step to identify supraspinatus tendon tear, and oblique sagittal images can be taken as an adjust to the former images."
CD009020,0,8615243,1,MR evaluation of rotator cuff pathology using T2-weighted fast spin-echo technique with and without fat suppression.,This study was designed to compare MR imaging findings from T2-weighted fast spin-echo images with and without fat suppression and then to compare surgical results with those MR imaging interpretations in the evaluation of rotator cuff disease.
CD009020,0,8741055,1,Ultrasonography for diagnosis of rotator cuff tear.,"In this study the clinical usefulness of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears was assessed. One hundred twenty-two patients undergoing preoperative ultrasonography were evaluated surgically. Three different ultrasonographic machines were applied with a 7.5-MHz linear-array transducer. Surgery confirmed a sensitivity of 79% for full-thickness tears and 50% for partial thickness tears. In 73 patients with negative ultrasonographic findings, the specificity was 100% for full-thickness tears and 90% for partial-thickness tears. The diagnostic sensitivity for full-thickness tears of the Hitachi EUB-340 system was significantly lower than those of Hitachi EUB-415 and EUB-515, and thus the former cannot be recommended for detection of rotator cuff tears. The sensitivity with regard to partial-thickness tears was also significantly lower with the Hitachi EUB-340 system as compared to the Hitachi EUB-515. There were no significant differences in false-positive rate among the three machines used. In conclusion, accurate ultrasonographic diagnosis of rotator cuff tear requires a high-resolution machine, as well as considerable experience in interpretation."

CD009020,0,8728370,0,Medial dislocation of the long head of the biceps tendon. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation.,"Medial dislocation of the long head of the biceps branchii tendon is a rare occurrence and is often associated with degenerative or traumatic tears of the rotator cuff, specifically tears of the subscapularis tendon. Following a dislocation, the biceps tendon will assume either an intra- or extra-articular position depending on whether or not the subscapularis tendon detaches from its humoral insertion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been found to provide valuable information concerning the location of the biceps tendon and the integrity of the rotator cuff. In this report, three patients with suspected dislocations of the biceps tendon are evaluated using MRI."
CD009020,0,8643842,1,[Magnetic resonance in the study of the painful shoulder. The surgical comparison in 30 consecutive cases].,"Eighty patients complaining of shoulder pain were examined with MRI from January, 1993, through December, 1994. Thirty of them were submitted to surgery, with an exhaustive inspection of shoulder structures and the treatment of abnormal findings. In this subgroup of surgical patients, MRI had depicted 16 complete tears of the rotator cuff, 4 partial tears, 8 cases of subacromial impingement, I humeral head osteochondritis and, finally, I humeral head osteochondritis with complete rotator cuff tear. Surgical findings confirmed MR diagnosis in 97% of cases. MR findings were then compared with literature data and some atypical features were observed in our series. MRI was totally reliable in complete cuff tears (16/30 patients), always showing the involvement of supraspinatus tendons and, in some cases, of other cuff tendons. In partial cuff tears (4/30 patients), besides the classic pattern of a fissure in the deep/superficial supraspinatus tendon, we observed intra- and peritendinous changes, with no tendon interruption, due to diffuse microlesions. When impingement due to subacromial space narrowing, with no cuff tear, was present (8/30 patients), MRI depicted different causes--e.g., acromioclavear arthrosis, coracoacromial ligament hypertrophy and posttraumatic changes. MRI showed tendinosis in all patients but overestimated it in one case where partial cuff tear was not confirmed surgically--the only false positive in our series. At surgery, all these cases were classified as stage I-II impingement (according to Neer's classification). Finally, MRI was very reliable in the study of bone conditions (osteochondritis), both isolated and associated with cuff tears. The diagnostic accuracy of MRI in the study of the painful shoulder was very high (97%), in agreement with literature data. This is very important because many different causes of shoulder conditions (abnormal tendons, bones and mechanics) may present with similar clinical symptoms. MRI appears as the only imaging method yielding complete and accurate pieces of information in the patients with a painful shoulder."

Sensible procedures in daily practice].","At first sight the anatomy of the shoulder may seem simple (see Fig. 1). However, for the physician treating a patient suffering from shoulder pain, the scapulo-thoracal interplay of 5 joints and 19 muscles, providing a wide and varied range of motion, may constitute an obstacle difficult to overcome. In the leisure athlete acute injuries must be distinguished from degenerative disease. Contact sports in particular tend to involve risks of falling on the shoulder, injuring the shoulder girdle or the elbow and wrist, sometimes with major consequences: complex fractures, dislocations, ligament and tendon lesions or joint instabilities. Thorough, rapid and cost-effective diagnostic evaluation of the athlete, involving clinical examination (function tests), radiographic imaging (shoulder a.p., y-view) and in selected cases ultrasonography (compared with the other side) may be necessary in starting early and effective therapy."
CD009020,0,8919503,1,Sonographic detection of tears of the anterior portion of the rotator cuff (subscapularis tendon tears).,"We studied the value of ultrasonography in identifying tears of the most anterior portion of the rotator cuff (subscapularis tendon tears). Shoulder sonography was performed on 1640 patients with shoulder symptoms, 435 of whom underwent surgery. Among the patients who were operated on, 17 had predominantly or exclusively subscapularis tendon tears; 14 of these were full-thickness and three were partial-thickness tears. Ultrasonography demonstrated 82% (14 of 17) of the subscapularis tendon tears; 86% (12 of 14) of the full-thickness tears and 67% (2 of 3) of the partial-thickness tears were correctly diagnosed with ultrasonography. Sonography can diagnose and show the size of subscapularis tendon tears reliably, but it necessitates that the arm can be externally rotated to the maximum extent when performing the study."
CD009020,0,8775111,0,Diagnosis of glenoid labral tears. A comparison between magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examinations.,"We studied 54 patients with shoulder pain secondary to anterior instability or glenoid labral tears refractory to 6 months of conservative management with no evidence of rotator cuff lesions. All patients had sufficient preoperative clinical data, magnetic resonance imaging, and shoulder arthroscopy results for analysis. The ability to predict the presence of a glenoid labral tear by physical examination was compared with that of magnetic resonance imaging (conventional and arthrogram) and confirmed with arthroscopy. There were 37 men and 17 women (average age, 34 years) in the study group. Of this group, 64% were throwing athletes and 61% recalled specific traumatic events. Clinical assessment included history with specific attention to pain with overhead activities, clicking, and instances of shoulder instability. Physical examination included the apprehension, relocation, load and shift, inferior sulcus sign, and crank tests. Shoulder arthroscopy confirmed labral tears in 41 patients (76%). Magnetic resonance imaging produced a sensitivity of 59% and a specificity of 85%. Physical examination yielded a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 85%. Physical examination is more accurate in predicting glenoid labral tears than magnetic resonance imaging. In this era of cost containment, completing the diagnostic workup in the clinic without expensive ancillary studies allows the patient's care to proceed in the most timely and economic fashion. Glenoid labral tears have been associated with overhead throwing activities, trauma, and shoulder instability. Assessment of an athlete with shoulder pain should take into account a careful history of clicking sounds or catching, symptoms with overhead activities, reports of instability, or previous trauma. On physical examination, patients with labral tears often demonstrate objective instability with or without clicking or catching during glenohumeral rotation. Plain radiographs have not been helpful, and radiologists have relied on techniques from arthrogram to arthrotomogram, CT arthrogram, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and MR arthrogram to assist in the diagnosis. Various sensitivities and specificities have been reported for these tests. However, a large degree of intra- and interobserver variability has been demonstrated, and the degree to which these studies are helpful in preoperative planning has been questioned. No previous study to our knowledge has involved MRI in a direct comparison of other diagnostic modalities. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the accuracy of MRI and physical examination in the diagnosis of glenoid labral tears."

Sonography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic lesion at the spinoglenoid notch; this lesion was diagnosed as a ganglion. Operative removal led to immediate pain relief and incomplete recovery of the compressed branches of the suprascapular nerve.
CD009020,0,8732800,0,Recent advances in shoulder surgery.,"Major changes have taken place in the diagnosis and treatment of rotator cuff tears. It seems that magnetic resonance imaging alone as a diagnostic tool is still not sensitive enough, particularly in the diagnosis of partial tears. Arthrography and arthroscopy are still considered essential for an accurate preoperative diagnosis. To guarantee a better postoperative result, a carefully planned course of preoperative physiotherapy is mandatory. In experienced hands, arthroscopic surgery gives results comparable to those obtained with open procedures. A careful debridement, anterior acromioplasty, and decompression have replaced extensive surgical intervention in the treatment of massive tears. The first results in treating calcifying tendinitis with shock-wave therapy seem encouraging. A more refined diagnosis of the impingement syndrome is a prerequisite for a successful outcome because impingement is not caused by a narrowing of the subacromial space in all patients. Increase in contents of this space and instability are equally important factors."

CD009020,0,8820096,0,Magnetic resonance imaging in musculoskeletal assessment: a surgeon's perspective.,"Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a significant advance in musculoskeletal noninvasive visualization, especially for the soft tissues including the menisci. The purpose of this article is to give the radiologist a surgeon's perspective on the role of this technology in clinical practice. For MR imaging to be cost effective, it must accurately define anatomy, and reveal changes that have an impact on patient care--i.e., be clinically relevant. For MR imaging to be accurate, optimum software, hardware, and an experienced radiologist are essential. However, even if an MR examination has high accuracy, the abnormal findings of this evaluation may not be related to the clinical problem that the patient presents with. This is supported by the demonstration that asymptomatic patients may have grade 3 meniscal tears, herniated discs, and rotator cuff changes. The MR examination may not change patient management even if it demonstrates pathologies such as a meniscal tear. The patient may tolerate the dysfunction and pain. The most cost-effective method of providing musculoskeletal care is still a careful history and competent physical examination."
CD009020,0,8820094,0,The magic angle effect in musculoskeletal MR imaging.,"The ""magic angle"" effect in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is caused by changes in the dipolar interactions between water hydrogen protons that are loosely bound along collagen fibrils in organized tissue such as tendon or articular cartilage. When tendons are aligned at 55 degrees to the main magnetic field, the T2 relaxation time is lengthened, causing focal increased signal on short echo time MR images. Tendons in the ankle, wrist, and rotator cuff of the shoulder are common sites to observe this effect. Distinguishing magic angle effect from pathologic signal abnormalities due to degeneration or partial tears requires close comparison between T1- and T2-weighted images, as well as evaluation for secondary signs of injury such as tendon thickening or associated fluid."

This paper presents the most common applications of MR arthrography in the shoulder, hip, knee, ankle, elbow and wrist, and explores the clinical indications in which MR arthrography adds the greatest benefit compared to standard arthrography and conventional MR imaging. Arthrographic MR images are most valuable in the evaluation of glenoid and acetabular labra, tendons of the rotator cuff, post-operative menisci, osteochondral fractures and loose bodies."

Pain was absent at rest but recurred immediately after activity was resumed. On examination, range of motion was normal. Hawkins' impingement sign and the palm-up test usually caused pain. Radiographic findings were normal. Arthrography showed leakage of contrast medium into the subscapularis fossa. The tear was not visualized with ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. Eight patients underwent an operation consisting of minimal acromioplasty with coracoacromial ligament resection, coracoidplasty, and suture of the rotator interval.

This study was undertaken to determine if magnetic resonance imaging was able to depict post-dislocation abnormalities and rotator cuff pathology and if MRI can replace CT arthrography. Sixty four patients, who were operated on for the first time (arthroscopy or arthrotomy) between November 1986 and July 1991, were compared in a blinded fashion with the results of MR imaging in 40 cases and of CT arthrographies in 24 cases. For the evaluation of rotator cuff tears MRI proved to have a sensitivity of 83.3% and an accuracy of 90.3%. Labral pathology was depicted with a sensitivity of 69.2% and an accuracy of 87.1%.

A clinicopathological review based on 66 surgically verified cases.,"This review is based on 66 patients with partial-thickness tears of the rotator cuff, verified at operation. Their average age was 54 years, and all had symptoms of subacromial impingement. The duration of shoulder pain was for between 2 and 108 months (mean 11.4 months). Ultrasonography, arthrography and bursography were helpful in establishing the diagnosis. On exploration, tears were found in the supraspinatus tendon, with 9 extending into the infraspinatus. After anterior acromioplasty, excision of the diseased portion and tenorrhaphy were undertaken. Satisfactory results were obtained in 62 patients (94%) with an average follow-up of 32 months. Spontaneous repair at the torn site was never seen. In addition to Neer's staging of impingement, we propose a new classification based on the integrity of the cuff tendon. We conclude that a partial-thickness cuff tear is an important cause of shoulder disability, which deserves much more clinical attention; misdiagnosis is common and leads to mismanagement. When conservative treatment fails, accurate diagnosis and proper surgical repair are essential."

Two anteroposterior projections complemented with a third view fulfill the requirements of two mutually orthogonal images. The third view can be the elevation view or either the axillary or Y-view. Additional projections are used depending on the clinical history and settings. Arthrography is almost the golden standard in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. Ultrasound is capable of enabling diagnosis of rotator cuff tears and other soft tissue lesions. The demanding technique requires a dedicated radiologist devoted to musculoskeletal examinations. Of the advanced imaging modalities CT depicts detailed bony images and, combined with arthrography, intra-articular pathology. MR is best suited for soft tissue lesions as well as bone marrow lesions. The choice of an advanced study should be considered according to the clinical history, the clinical findings and the results of the radiography.

The studies were reviewed simultaneously by two authors. Each cuff was assigned a tendon grade and an overall cuff score with MRI criteria previously described in the literature. A newly described ""lateral acromion angle"" was measured from a specified oblique coronal cut on each MRI study and was correlated with the corresponding MRI-determined rotator cuff score and supraspinatus tendon grade. Observed correlations were analyzed by using statistical methods. The average measured lateral acromion angle was 78 degrees, with a range from 64 degrees to 99 degrees. Eight shoulders had angles less than or equal to 70 degrees, and all eight of these patients were found to have full-thickness rotator cuff tears. As the lateral acromion angle decreased, a statistically significant increase in rotator cuff disease was noted (p < 0.0001). A significant correlation between increasing age and rotator cuff disease was also observed (p < 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis confirmed that both the lateral acromion angle and the age of the patient were independent predictors of rotator cuff score. Finally, although a trend was noted suggesting a correlation between acromion type (I--flat, II--curved, and III--hooked) and MRI-determined rotator cuff disease, this trend did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.12). Surgical correlation with MRI rotator cuff findings in 35 patients showed an MRI sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 83%. A statistically significant correlation between the lateral acromion angle and MRI-determined rotator cuff disease has been noted.

A prospective comparison with arthroscopy of 25 cases.,"The purpose of our study was to evaluate the use of static magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a preoperative diagnostic tool in young patients with a traumatic primary anterior shoulder dislocation. Twenty-five patients who had acute primary traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation were examined with MRI and arthroscopy. The patients (18 male and 7 female) were between 16 and 39 years old (mean age, 27 years). They had no previous shoulder dislocations. The dislocations were confirmed radiographically. Examination with MRI and arthroscopy was performed within 10 days after the trauma. The MRI evaluation was performed before the arthroscopic examination, and the images were interpreted by an experienced magnetic resonance radiologist. No information from the MRI examination was available to the orthopedic surgeons before arthroscopy. The standard of reference for comparison was arthroscopy. Subacute MRI evaluation identified 15 labral tears, 12 Hill-Sachs lesions, 1 total rotator cuff lesion, 1 partial joint side rotator cuff lesion, and 1 partial rupture of the biceps tendon. Arthroscopic examination revealed 22 labral tears, 15 Hill-Sachs lesions, 1 total rotator cuff lesion, 1 partial joint side rotator cuff tear, 1 partial rupture of the biceps tendon, and 1 osseous Bankart lesion. Anterior capsulolabral tears and Hill-Sachs lesions appeared with a high incidence after acute anterior primary shoulder dislocation.

A report of four cases.,"The shoulder's unique wide range of motion is largely restrained by the articular capsule and the external ligaments of the glenohumeral joint. Internally, the long head of the biceps tendon passes within the capsule and inserts on the superior lip of the glenoid labrum. Trauma distracting this tendon can tear the superior glenoid labrum, producing the superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) syndrome. Four patients, two of whom were female, presented with complaints of acute shoulder pain associated with weakness in abduction and forward flexion. Routine shoulder roentgenograms were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed a superior glenoid labral tear consistent with a SLAP syndrome. The superior labrum, unlike the firmly bound inferior portion, is loosely attached to the glenoid fossa. This inherent mobility predisposes it to disruption. To routine ultrasonography and arthrogram, the superior labrum may be obscured by superimposed structures. Shoulder arthroscopy, computed tomography, arthrography, and MRI have relatively equal sensitivity in visualizing these labral tears. The SLAP lesion accompanies 16% of all rotator cuff tears, occurring more often than heretofore recognized. When clinically suspected, they can be readily visualized by a noninvasive MRI examination."

In 33.6% of cases, involvement of the long head of biceps was found. It was clearly correlated with the size of the tears: 25.9% in isolated supraspinatus tears and 68.8% in three-tendon tears of subscapularis, supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Differentiation between fresh, traumatic tears and degenerative tears is possible by means of measuring retraction, determining the length of the distal cuff stump and by formal criteria of the stump configuration as well as by bursal criteria. Differentiation of old tears of suspected traumatic origin from those with degenerative causes is impossible."
CD009020,0,8532335,0,[Magnetic resonance tomography in disorders of the rotator cuff].,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a powerful diagnostic tool for the evaluation of the painful shoulder in general and of the diseased rotator cuff in particular. MRI evaluates cuff disease in terms of tendon morphology and pathologic signal alterations within diseased cuff tendons. Additionally, MRI displays important pathoanatomic changes of the coracoacromial arch which are predisposing factors for the development of shoulder impingement syndrome and cuff disease. The accuracy of MRI in diagnosing small rotator cuff tears and in assessing the integrity of the labral-ligamentous complex is improved by the intraarticular injection of a suitable contrast agent. In the preoperative assessment of patients with cuff disease, MR arthrography enhances the staging of the disease and allows a more confident exclusion of concomitant lesions of the shoulder joint."

Although synovitis of the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints may be seen in rheumatiod arthritis (RA), periarticular shoulder problems may also occur. The objective of this study was to define the prevalence of shoulder symptoms and periarticular shoulder abnormalities in a group of RA patients and to correlate findings on physical examination with those obtained with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Shoulder function was evaluated by history, physical examination, roentgenogram, and MRI in a group of older, male RA patients; 82% of the 40 patients evaluated had a history of shoulder pain, and 88% had an abnormal physical examination. The most frequent abnormality involved the rotator cuff musculature. Plain roentgenograms were abnormal in only 10 of the 26 (38%) patients. In contrast, abnormalities were noted on MRI in 13 of 14 patients studied (93%). The most frequent MRI abnormalities related to the rotator cuff, with a spectrum of abnormalities ranging from mild inflammatory changes through compete tendon tears. Of note, in all 14 patients undergoing MRI, physical examination findings correlated with abnormalities noted on MRI.Problems referred to the shoulder may be very common in RA patients. Rotator cuff dysfunction was the most common cause of shoulder problems in a population of older, male RA patients. A thorough physical examination often establishes the cause of these problems."
CD009020,0,8581997,0,Anatomy and pathomechanics of shoulder instability.,"The mechanisms contributing to glenohumeral stability are complex and varied. The rotator cuff is the dominant contributor to stability through the mid arcs of motion through concavity compression. At the end ranges of motion, the capsular ligamentous system becomes responsible for shoulder stability. As the shoulder position varies from adduction to abduction and internal to external rotation, varying components of the capsular ligamentous system become responsible for static shoulder stability. The nature of the individual ligament contribution to overall static stability has become better known through biomechanical cutting studies of cadaveric shoulders. Further insight into the pathoanatomy of shoulder instability can be gleaned from MR imaging studies that defined which tissues have been injured and which have not. This more detailed understanding of the capsular ligamentous system will eventually result in a more precise nomenclature of defining shoulder instability. The current use of the words anterior shoulder instability is not unlike the use of the term internal derangement of the knee from the late 1970s. In the future, there will be discussions of clinical diagnoses of IGHLC injury or incompetence. The more precisely we know all the details of the mechanisms of shoulder stability, the more precisely we can clinically define the various injuries and syndromes that afflict our patients."
CD009020,0,8552811,0,[Medial luxation of the long head of the brachial biceps. Magnetic resonance imaging].,"The medial intraarticular dislocation of the biceps tendon of the shoulder is a rare pathologic condition and its diagnosis before surgery is very important to properly repair the tears of rotator cuff tendons, the rotator cuff being nearly always involved. We report our experience in 8 patients (1.8%) with biceps tendon dislocation observed in a series of 432 patients submitted to MR studies to address several diagnostic issues. The MR patterns of biceps tendon dislocation and the related physiopathologic mechanisms are discussed. The MR images were retrospectively reviewed by two of the authors and dislocations were diagnosed in a subgroup of 34 patients (7.8%), associated with full-thickness tears of the tendon of supraspinatus muscle; all patients also presented a full-thickness tear of the subscapularis tendon. A dislocated biceps tendon can follow a variety of courses depending on the pattern of subscapularis tendon tear. We always found a complete dislocation of the biceps tendon; other dislocation patterns reported in the literature, and particularly oblique and superficial dislocations, were never observed in our series. Dislocation is visible on axial images, where the tendon appears completely displaced from the bicipital groove, but also sagittal and coronal images can depict the more medial position of the tendon. In our patients this abnormality was correctly identified in 4 patients during the first observation and in the extant patients during the retrospective review. The dislocation of the biceps tendon of the shoulder was frequently associated with a complete tear of the supraspinatus tendon (23.5%). All patients exhibited severe joint effusion and in two patients the dislodged tendon was also inflamed."

CD009020,0,8548441,0,Acromial structure and tears of the rotator cuff.,"Rotator cuff lesions have been related to the structure of the acromion. We report a clinical review of 56 shoulders and the analysis of their acromial structure as seen on the radiographic arch (outlet) view and magnetic resonance imaging. The shoulders were classified as acromial type I (flat), type II (curved), or type III (hooked). On plain radiographs 89% of type III acromions had tearing of the rotator cuff (p < 0.001). The association between acromial type as determined on magnetic resonance imaging and the presence of rotator cuff tearing was less significant. Magnetic resonance imaging offered no additional benefit over plain radiographs for determining acromial type. In addition, a method of quantitating acromial structure (the ""acromial angle"") was devised. This angle showed a significant association with acromial types (p < 0.0001) seen on plain radiographs and had good interobserver reproducibility (coefficient of variation, 0.1). With this measurement system a type I acromion had an acromial angle of 0 degrees to 12 degrees; a type II acromion, 13 degrees to 27 degrees; and a type III acromion, greater than 27 degrees."
CD009020,0,7671508,0,Function of supraspinatus muscle with torn cuff evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging.,"An estimation of the residual function of the supraspinatus muscle after rotator cuff tear is useful to select the best operative method for repair of the torn cuff and to evaluate prognosis after surgery. The residual function of the supraspinatus muscle was studied by magnetic resonance imaging with motor unit potential amplitudes on electromyograms. Forty-three normal shoulders and 41 shoulders in patients with cuff tears were scanned by magnetic resonance imaging parallel to the long axis of the supraspinatus muscle. The ratio of the largest width of the supraspinatus muscle belly to the distance from the greater tubercle to the proximal end of the supraspinatus muscle was termed the supraspinatus muscle belly ratio. The linear bands of the supraspinatus muscle and the variation in the muscular signal intensity were classified into 3 grades. With a reduction in the motor unit potential amplitude, the supraspinatus muscle belly ratio became lower than 0.15. Additionally, the degree of appearance of the linear bands in the supraspinatus muscle belly increased, and the signal intensity became less uniform. The residual function of the supraspinatus muscle decreased when such morphologic changes were shown by magnetic resonance images. By analyzing these images, the best operative method for repairing a rotator cuff tear can be selected and the prognosis can be evaluated."

CD009020,0,7658938,0,Os acromiale in a baseball catcher.,"Throwing injuries of the shoulder can result from an acute traumatic event or chronic overuse. Shoulder impingement has multiple etiologies; the most common being rotator cuff weakness/overuse and resultant glenohumeral instability. However, an uncommon cause of shoulder impingement syndrome is that of a nonfused os acromiale. There are three centers of ossification in the acromion which are usually completely fused by 18 yr of age. The most common site of nonunion is between the meso-acromion and meta-acromion. Os acromiale is reported at a rate of 14/1000 (1.4%) and is bilateral in approximately 62% of cases. The classic diagnosis is radiographically defined with both AP and axillary lateral views, and a contralateral comparison view may be helpful. Computerized axial tomography also aids in the diagnosis. Most os acromiale are asymptomatic. However, if recalcitrant impingement syndrome and/or rotator cuff tears are found in association with os acromiale, then surgical fusion or resection of the ossicle is recommended."
CD009020,0,7644916,0,[Role of the subacromial space on development of the impingement syndrome. II].,"Twenty-five patients with suspected impingement syndrome on the basis of clinical examination were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In paracoronal and parasagittal planes, different measurements of bony structures of the subacromial space and of the glenoid joint were performed, as in the anatomical study reported in the companion paper. A healthy, age-and sex-matched group of 25 persons underwent the same MRI-procedure and the results were compared with those in the patients. Ruptures of the rotator cuff were excluded by means of standard X-rays, physical examination, and ultrasound. The comparison revealed a highly significant difference between the sizes of the subacromial space. Healthy persons had a space that was larger by more than one third than that of the patients. Other parameters did not differ significantly between the two groups. In a further part of the study the insertion zone of the coracoacromial ligament into the undersurface of the acromion was histologically studied in 24 autopsy specimens. Different staining techniques were used to find out whether microscopic changes occur during different stages of life. Cartilage without bone formation of the acromion was found in children. In adult specimens bony projections of the undersurface of the acromion and thickening of the surrounding fibrocartilage were found, but there was no correlation between ageing and these changes. However, in patients suffering from impingement syndrome the subacromial space is reduced. Acromioplasty enlarges the space by resection of the anterior part of the acromion. Bony spurs on the acromion and a thickening of the fibrocartilaginous layer are not degenerative changes, but they are caused by increased tensile strength of the coracoacromial ligament and are not influenced by age."
CD009020,0,7617385,0,[Calcific tendinitis of the shoulder].,"Degenerative ossification is formed directly at the major tubercle. Like in any other gliding tendon, fibrocartilage cells lie on the articular side of the rotator tendon at the pivot of the humerus head. Typically, the calcific deposits of calcifying tendinitis are found between these two areas. At this site, hydroxyapatite is usually formed by fibrocartilage cells through an unknown stimulus. There is no ossification. This is a two-phase disease. During the chronic initial phase, a calcific deposit is formed in the tendon of the rotator cuff. In the X-ray, it is clearly circumscribed and has a dense appearance (type I). Pain is inconsistent and may exist for years. In the acute phase, the deposit undergoes spontaneous resolution. Now it takes on a translucent and cloudy appearance without clear circumscription (type III). Patients experience severe pain for 2-3 weeks. Finally, a normally functioning shoulder joint will result. The X-ray therefore allows a prognostic conclusion. In a study including 235 calcific deposits, it became clear that there are some cases where it is not possible to designate the specific X-ray morphology to a given deposit (type II). Irrespective of the phase of disease, the so-called calcific deposit is composed of poorly mineralized hydroxyapatite. For a diagnosis, we require: a typical history, clinical findings consistent with tendinitis of the rotator cuff, calcific deposits in the tendon associated with signs and symptoms of tendinitis. It is recommended that radiographs be taken at least in AP projections with the shoulder in internal and external rotation to demonstrate the deposits without super-imposition. Ultrasound shows concomitant bursitis and is useful for the differential diagnosis of rupture of the rotator cuff. Radiographic diagnosis is most difficult when there are small opacifications near the rotator attachment. In this case, allocation may become possible only later in the course of disease. Initial treatment should always be non-operative. Almost all therapeutic modalities are said to be quite successful. Needles under local anesthesia is recommended only for patients with marked pain who lack any signs of resolution in the X-ray. According to a prospective study, the success rates of needles depend on the roentgenologic findings: in type I deposits, resolution occurs in 33%, in typq II deposits in 71%. Freedom from pain is seen in about 50% of the patients. Type III deposits undergo resolution with and without therapy in about 2-3 weeks. Post-operative results are reported to lie between 77% and 96% irrespective of the method used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD009020,0,7617377,0,"[Spontaneous tendon ruptures. Etiology, pathogenesis and therapy].","Spontaneous tendon ruptures are ascribed to recurrent microtrauma resulting from continuous mechanical loading in a critical zone, to muscular imbalance combined with poor coordination as a result of inappropriate training, and also to deteriorating circulation with increasing age. Ruptures of the rotator cuff occur more frequently with increasing age, and the size of the rupture also correlates with age. The frequency of the complaint in men, the predominant involvement of the dominant shoulder, and also the above-average occurrence in occupations involving strenuous physical work indicate that degenerative change plays a role. In about 50% of patients presenting with a ruptured rotator cuff, the genesis is clearly traumatic. A trauma will almost always be the cause of an isolated rupture of the subscapularis tendon. The choice of reconstruction technique for a ruptured rotator cuff depends on the patient's age and level of activity in daily life. In the case of young patients, further surgical measures to repair the defect are indicated following failure of primary suture of the tendon, but in older patients subacromial debridement alone is considered the appropriate procedure. Rupture of the long head of the biceps tendon is usually a sequela of a rotator cuff rupture and the resulting loss of protective cover. Isolated ruptures of the long head of the biceps tendon are much rarer. They tend to occur in middle-aged patients and are usually the result of a relatively minor trauma. Ruptures of the distal biceps tendon are also relatively rare (3%) and are always of traumatic origin. There is no absolute indication for surgical intervention for a ruptured long head of the biceps tendon. Surgical repair is essential in the case of rupture of the distal biceps tendon. Transosseous reinsertion at the tuberosity of the radius is the recommended method of repair. Today's frequent cases of rupture of the Achilles tendon in the framework of sports activities are ascribed to inappropriate training procedures in combination with poor muscular coordination. An exogenous cause is the administration of local injections for pain relief in the form of a so-called tendon anesthetic. Today an increasingly important role is assigned to functional therapy with ultrasound support, although suturing the tendon is still the intervention of choice to meet the high functional demands imposed in the framework of top-level sports.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD009020,0,7617376,0,[Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) of tendon injuries].,"Both ultrasound and MR imaging have become increasingly important for the assessment of tendon abnormalities. Ultrasound is widely available and is mainly suitable for emergency situations in traumatology and as a screening method. For soft tissue imaging only up-to-date sonographic equipment should be used. Moreover, the examiner's experience is crucial for adequate results. MR imaging is not as easily available. However, it is more reproducible and may be indicated in a preoperative situation. Most publications about sonography and MR imaging deal with the rotator cuff and the Achilles tendon. Fewer investigations relate to the posterior tibial tendon, the extensors of the knee and the proximal and distal biceps tendon. The role of ultrasound and MR imaging in abnormalities of these structures is discussed based on the literature and our own experience."

CD009020,0,7754927,0,Shoulder pain: a diagnostic dilemma.,"The etiology of shoulder pain can usually be placed into one of five categories: fracture and/or contusion, shoulder separation involving the clavicle, instability of the glenohumeral joint, impingement syndrome involving the rotator cuff or biceps tendinitis, and frozen shoulder. Non-shoulder pathology, such as cervical strain, thoracic outlet syndrome and referred pain from phrenic nerve irritation, should be excluded when evaluating patients presenting with shoulder pain. After inflammatory or infectious arthritis has been ruled out, the history should point to either acute trauma or an overuse injury. Physical examination may provide information about neurovascular status, palpable tenderness, range of motion, strength, instability and impingement. Radiographic studies are usually indicated in patients with a history of trauma, but they are often not necessary in the initial evaluation of overuse injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging and arthrograms should be reserved for patients who have not responded to six to eight weeks of conservative treatment and are candidates for surgery."

In the second part of the study, we considered only 33 surgical patients. Surgery confirmed cuff tears in 30 patients (90.9%), whereas in 3 false-positive patients US had overestimated focal hyperechoic areas and tendon thinning. Thus, our study confirms the almost absolute sensitivity of some US signs of cuff lesions, e.g., cuff disappearance and convexity loss, in the screening of the patients with a chronically painful shoulder.

CD009020,0,7606420,0,Considerations about a unique clinical pattern: flexion block of the shoulder.,"Frozen shoulder is a well-defined nosologic entity characterized by retraction of the anterior portion of the glenohumeral joint capsule. When clinical findings are inconclusive, arthrography can differentiate a frozen shoulder from a stiff and painful shoulder. We report three cases of stiffness of the shoulder that we believe was due to a unique pathological process. Flexion was restricted to 120 degrees and a sensation suggestive of mechanical blockage was felt upon passive flexion. Medical rotation was restricted and painful, whereas lateral rotation with the elbow held against the torso was normal. Findings upon arthrography or magnetic resonance imaging were normal, with no evidence of capsulitis or chronic rotator cuff lesions. Our pathogenic hypotheses include a lesion of the proximal portion of the long head of the biceps brachii or a focal ligamentous lesion.

Examination revealed visible atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle and decreased strength in external rotation and abduction. Magnetic Resonance Imaging was inconclusive. Electromyographic examination revealed decreased suprascapular nerve conduction to the infraspinatus muscle. Our diagnosis was entrapment neuropathy from traction on the suprascapular nerve at the spinoglenoid notch, causing delayed conduction to the infraspinatus muscle. We took a conservative approach of shoulder rehabilitation and activity modification, which resulted in the athlete returning to a highly competitive level without further problems, despite the remaining atrophy and muscle weakness.

All scans were interpreted by one radiologist who was blinded to clinical data. Appearance of rotator cuff tendons on the images was graded. Grade 0 was normal, homogeneous low signal intensity structure. Grade 1 lesion was focal, linear, or diffuse intermediate signal through the tendon. Grade 2 lesion was high signal intensity within the tendon and less than full thickness. Grade 3 was high signal intensity through full thickness of the tendon. No supraspinatus or infraspinatus tendons were grade 0 (normal); all supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons had grade 1 changes through the tendons; and 7 of 30 (23%) of the tendons had grade 2 changes. None of the 30 shoulders had grade 3 changes in the rotator cuff tendons. There is a wide array of abnormal magnetic resonance imaging signals in shoulders of young asymptomatic individuals, but they do not have full-thickness rotator cuff tears (grade 3 lesion).

CD009020,0,7612422,0,Update in shoulder magnetic resonance imaging.,"The shoulder is capable of the largest range motion of any articulation in the human body. Because it is inherently unstable, the glenohumeral joint is dependent on the support given by surrounding muscular, ligamentous, and tendonous structures. A variety of disorders may involve these structural supports and lead to shoulder pain and dysfunction. Refinements in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques have allowed improved characterization of these abnormalities and may permit earlier and more specific diagnoses in patients with shoulder pain. Theories as to the pathogenesis of rotator cuff disease include intrinsic and extrinsic impingement as well as overload tendinosis. MR is useful in the evaluation of rotator cuff impingement and tears. The classification and MR assessment of glenohumeral instability has recently received increased attention yet remains an area of difficulty. MR arthrography has been used with some success in the evaluation of instability demonstrating improved diagnostic sensitivities and specificities when compared with conventional MR. Relatively little attention has been paid to MR evaluation of the shoulder after surgery. Micrometallic artifact, distortion of soft-tissue planes, and persistent signal abnormalities within rotator cuff and capsulolabral structures may hinder assessment of recurrent tear or instability in the postoperative patient."

In this report, a fourth type of acromion is described in which the undersurface is convex near its distal end. The frequency of a type 4 acromion in the normal population is discussed based on a retrospective review of the MR examinations of 30 patients that originally were read as normal."

CD009020,0,7735751,0,Case report: lipoma arborescens of the sub-deltoid bursa.,Lipoma arborescens is a rare synovial disorder which principally affects the knee joint. We describe an unusual case of lipoma arborescens arising within the sub-deltoid bursa in association with a rotator cuff tear. Pre-operative diagnosis was made by magnetic resonance imaging.
CD009020,0,7731767,0,[Comparison between T2*- and T2-weighted images in diagnosing rotator cuff tears].,"This study was performed to determine the merits of T2*-weighted images in diagnosing rotator cuff tear, compared with T2-weighted images. T2-and T2*-weighted images were obtained in 10 asymptomatic volunteers and 94 patients with symptoms referable to the rotator cuff. The increased signal with full thickness of the rotator cuff was not shown on either T2- or T2*-weighted images in the volunteers. These findings on T2-weighted images and on T2*-weighted images were observed in 33 and 58 of 94 patients with symptoms, respectively. Every patient who showed these abnormal findings on T2-weighted images had the abnormal findings on T2*-weighted images. These findings on T2*-weighted images were wider than those on T2-weighted images in 20 of 33 patients. Surgical findings were available in 21 of 94 patients. Rotator cuff tears were surgically confirmed in 20 patients whose MR images showed increased signal lesions on both T2- and T2*-weighted images. On the other hand, one patient who did not have rotator cuff tear showed increased signal lesion with full thickness on T2*-weighted images, but not on T2-weighted images. We think increased signal lesions on T2-weighted images may strongly suggest rotator cuff tear, whereas those on T2*-weighted images are not specific."
CD009020,0,8787306,1,[Ultrasonography of the tendons of the rotator cuffs of the shoulder].,"After a short review of the use of ultrasonography to study shoulder rotator tendons, the technique of the investigation is described, as well as the main landmarks, findings indicative of complete rotator cuff tear, and limitations of ultrasonography in this indication. A number of issues concerning the preoperative workup are discussed. Results in a prospective study of 100 patients are reported. Findings upon ultrasonography, arthrography, and surgical exploration in these patients are analyzed comparatively. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of complete rotator cuff tear (RCT) were 95% and 100%, respectively. These data show that ultrasonography is a reliable investigation for confirming, detecting, and evaluating RCT, although extensive experience with the technique is required."

Early clinical experience indicates that MR arthrography improves the visualization of intraarticular structures [1-3]. On T1-weighted images, high-signal contrast solution outlines the low-signal surface of the cuff tendons, the contour of the glenoid labrum, and the course of the glenohumeral ligaments. This essay illustrates the anatomic features of normal glenohumeral structures seen on MR arthrography and common pathologic disorders of the labral-ligamentous complex and rotator cuff."
CD009020,0,7895205,0,Massive rotator cuff tears. Screening by routine radiographs.,"To clarify their usefulness in screening massive rotator cuff tear, routine radiographs of the shoulder were compared in three groups: (1) shoulders with a massive rotator cuff tear (MRCT), (2) shoulders with a small full-thickness rotator cuff tear (SRCT), and (3) normal control shoulders. Two different statistical methods were employed to assess the gradation (order) of correlation in 83 shoulders (22 were MRCTs, 31 with SRCTs, and 30 controls). Superior migration of the humerus and deformity of the greater tuberosity showed by far the more significant contribution to MRCT than did other abnormalities. When the shoulders were screened for these two abnormalities, the sensitivity was 78% (21/27) and specificity was 98% (55/56)."

CD009020,0,7822341,0,Abnormal findings on magnetic resonance images of asymptomatic shoulders.,"Magnetic resonance images of the shoulders of ninety-six asymptomatic individuals were evaluated to determine the prevalence of findings consistent with a tear of the rotator cuff. The scans were reviewed independently by two diagnostic radiologists who are experienced in the interpretation of magnetic resonance images of the shoulder. The over-all prevalence of tears of the rotator cuff in all age-groups was 34 per cent (thirty-three). There were fourteen full-thickness tears (15 per cent) and nineteen partial-thickness tears (20 per cent). The frequency of full-thickness and partial-thickness tears increased significantly with age (p < 0.001 and 0.05, respectively). Twenty-five (54 per cent) of the forty-six individuals who were more than sixty years old had a tear of the rotator cuff: thirteen (28 per cent) had a full-thickness tear and twelve (26 per cent) had a partial-thickness tear. Of the twenty-five individuals who were forty to sixty years old, one (4 per cent) had a full-thickness tear and six (24 per cent) had a partial-thickness tear. Of the twenty-five individuals who were nineteen to thirty-nine years old, none had a full-thickness tear and one (4 per cent) had a partial-thickness tear. Magnetic resonance imaging identified a high prevalence of tears of the rotator cuff in asymptomatic individuals. These tears were increasingly frequent with advancing age and were compatible with normal, painless, functional activity. The results of the present study emphasize the potential hazards of the use of magnetic resonance imaging scans alone as a basis for the determination of operative intervention in the absence of associated clinical findings."

Synovial fluid aspirated from the joint cavity appeared purulent but contained few leucocytes and no birefringent crystals. It was, however, rich in apatite crystals. A communication between the subacromial bursa and the gleno-humeral cavity through the rotator cuff could be demonstrated by sonography. The acute arthritis was secondary to the intra-articular rupture of a peri-articular calcification."
CD009020,0,7713089,0,Role of shoulder ultrasonography in the evaluation of the painful shoulder.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of ultrasonography in the detection of rotator cuff tears. In a prospective study of 41 patients, the ultrasound results could be compared with the combined results of (CT) arthrography, arthroscopy and operation. The sensitivity of sonography in detecting partial and total rotator cuff tears was 86%, the specificity 91%, the positive predictive value 96% and the negative predictive value 73%. In spite of the relatively small size of this series, our results are comparable with those of most other studies. Based on these results, sonography can provide a non-invasive, rapid and inexpensive diagnostic method for screening patients with shoulder complaints. A disadvantage of the method is its long learning curve."
CD009020,0,7707483,0,Sonographic findings of rotator cuff calcifications.,"We studied the findings and value of sonography in the diagnosis of rotator cuff calcifications in comparison to plain radiographs. Sonograms were correlated with plain radiographs in 951 patients. The diagnosis of rotator cuff calcifications was made by ultrasonography in 87 and with plain films in 93 of 951 patients. Sonography displayed two additional bursal slurry calcifications were found on plain films. Three types of calcifications were found with ultrasonography: (1) a hyperechoic focus with a well-defined shadow (79%); (2) a hyperechoic focus with a faint shadow (14%); and, (3) a hyperechoic focus with no shadow (7%). Large and slurry calcifications and bursal calcifications were better seen with ultrasonography, but small and more scattered deposits were better found on plain radiographs. Sonography proved to be reliable in the detection and localization of rotator cuff calcifications, but classification into a formative or resorptive phase could not be done. Because of this and the possibility of pathologic conditions of bone, plain radiographs should always be obtained prior to doing sonography."

CD009020,0,7992740,0,MR diagnosis of superior labral anterior posterior (SLAP) injuries of the glenoid labrum: value of routine imaging without intraarticular injection of contrast material.,"Superior labral anterior posterior (SLAP) lesions are peculiar types of tears that involve the superior and anterior aspects of the glenoid labrum and extend posteriorly. The biceps tendon may also be involved in the injury. There have been conflicting reports in the literature about the value of MR imaging in depicting these injuries. Some authors have advocated imaging in special planes and, more recently, the use of intraarticular injection of contrast material to facilitate the diagnosis of SLAP injuries. Symptoms of SLAP injury of the glenoid labrum are nonspecific, and patients are often imaged according to routine imaging protocols that include images in axial, oblique coronal, and oblique sagittal planes using spin-echo pulse sequences. Intraarticular injection of contrast material is not part of routine MR imaging of the shoulder. We sought to determine the value of routine MR imaging without intraarticular contrast enhancement in the diagnosis of SLAP injuries of the glenoid labrum."

The authors investigated US sensitivity with the retrospective review of 20 surgical patients with a chronically painful shoulder. US sensitivity was 85%, with 15% false-negative results. Seventeen true-positive cases were restudied for the three main US signs of cuff tear: marked tendon thinning was observed in 64.7% of cases, cuff disappearance in 23.5% and focal discontinuity in 11.8%. This retrospective study confirms that, whenever US shows a cuff tear, the diagnosis can be made, while when US findings are negative or questionable, but clinics are positive, MRI must be performed."
CD009020,0,7855722,0,The impact of MRI on our understanding of the pathology of sports injuries.,"NMR imaging has become an important diagnostic tool in the evaluation of musculoskeletal disease. However, its ability to evaluate pathogenic mechanisms of disease may eventually have even a greater impact on patient care. NMR imaging has significantly affected our understanding of the clinical significance of meniscal tears and appropriate patient management. It has also extended our understanding of the prevalence and importance of x-ray and arthroscopically occult bone, tendon and ligament injuries. By knowing the pathogenic mechanisms of disease, we can more reliably diagnose and treat pathology. In particular, many horizontal degenerative tears in older patients may be asymptomatic and are best left in place. Many acute tears may be best treated with immediate meniscal repair. MR imaging can reliably different these tear types with non-invasive imaging. MR's ability to detect bone injuries may lead to aggressive early non-weightbearing on injured bone, thereby preserving the subchondral bone from collapse and the joint from secondary osteoarthrosis. MRI's ability to detect and stage degenerative tendonosis of tendons and ligaments, such as the rotator cuff, may lead to arthroscopic decompression or debridement which provides symptomatic relief and may preserve and protect the intact cuff."

Of 76 patients with clinical instability and impingement, 31 had a normal rotator cuff and 45 demonstrated a partial or full tear of the supraspinatus tendon at surgery. Results were compared with those from magnetic resonance (MR) scans of 57 asymptomatic volunteers. Of the 45 patients with a supraspinatus tear, 38% (17) had a flat acromial undersurface (type I), 40% (18) had a concave acromial undersurface (type II), 18% (8) had an anteriorly hooked acromion (type III), and 4% (2) had an inferiorly convex acromion (type IV). Among the 31 patients with a normal rotator cuff at surgery and the 57 asymptomatic volunteers, the respective prevalences of the type I acromion were 39% (12) and 44% (25), of type II 48% (15) and 35% (20), type III 3% (1) and 12% (7), and type IV 10% (3) and 9% (5). Shoulders with surgically proven rotator cuff tears showed a tendential association with a type III acromion (8/45) and statistically significant associations with a thickened coracoacromial ligament (17/45) and acromioclavicular enthesophytes (18/45). For the association between inferiorly directed acromioclavicular joint enthesophytes and rotator cuff tears, age appears to be a confounding factor. The type IV acromion, newly classified by this study, does not have a recognizable association with rotator cuff tears.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009020,0,7855336,0,"Labrocapsular ligamentous complex of the shoulder: normal anatomy, anatomic variation, and pitfalls of MR imaging and MR arthrography.","Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a useful modality for evaluating the labrocapsular ligamentous complex (LCLC) of the shoulder. MR arthrography is an important and occasionally indispensable supplementary modality for accurate differentiation between normal and deranged glenohumeral joints. Because of the joint distention that occurs during MR arthrography, it is especially helpful in detecting subtle capsular derangement, as occurs in patients with atraumatic instability. Also, some of the pitfalls associated with MR imaging of the LCLC are less likely to occur with MR arthrography. Radiologists should look for several key abnormalities when evaluating MR images of the shoulder: an anterior or posterior Bankart lesion; a Hill-Sachs defect; a tear of the rotator cuff, glenoid labrum, or superior labrum-biceps tendon attachment; and loose bodies. Knowledge of normal anatomy, normal variations, and pitfalls in image interpretation related to evaluation of the LCLC will help the radiologist accurately detect debilitating derangements associated with glenohumeral instability."

Further refinements in design, new imaging sequences, and additional clinical experience should help to increase the accuracy and flexibility of this imaging modality."
CD009020,0,7824769,1,[Rotator cuff rupture in the shoulder impingement syndrome. Echography and arthrography: 2 diagnostic methods compared].,"After briefly reviewing the shoulder impingement syndrome, the authors investigate the role of two diagnostic imaging methods, i.e., ultrasonography (US) and arthrography, in demonstrating the typical features of this condition. Over a 15 months' period, 190 patients suffering from shoulder pain were examined with arthrography; 50 of them subsequently underwent acromion plastic surgery and rotator cuff stitching. This study was aimed at comparing US and arthrographic results, applying classifiable criteria to make the most accurate diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. The lack of visibility of the rotator cuff at US was the major and clearest sign of tear (100% of cases). The association between cuff thinning and hypo/hyperechoic damaged focal areas was another major sign (in 76.19% of complete tears and in 14.28% of incomplete tears). Hyperechoic focal areas alone proved to be a false-positive finding in 5 cases, while in 11 of 19 cases normal US patterns were a false-negative finding; in 3 cases other conditions were diagnosed. To conclude, the value of US is emphasized in the screening of the painful shoulder and the use of arthrography is suggested when both clinical tests and US fail to yield enough information for a diagnosis to be made."

CD009020,0,7924049,0,Imaging techniques for glenohumeral arthritis and glenohumeral arthroplasty.,"A thorough history and physical examination can usually determine the cause of a painful shoulder. In most cases, the diagnosis and cause of glenohumeral arthritis are fairly obvious. Imaging studies such as radiographs, computed tomography (CT), arthrography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are used to confirm and further define the pathologic process. Early in the development of glenohumeral arthrosis, subtle radiographic findings may suggest the diagnosis when the symptoms are mild. Later in the progression of joint destruction, imaging studies are crucial to the planning of prosthetic arthroplasty. Subsequent to arthroplasty, imaging studies can identify existing or potential problems that might correlate with the clinical course. Recent advances in musculoskeletal imaging, such as CT, ultrasound, and MR imaging, enable the physician to confirm or document anatomic pathology that was previously only inferred. There has been a corresponding increase in the use of imaging modalities. Concurrently, cost has become a major concern, and its limitation or reduction a priority of current and future medical care. Consequently, the knowledge gained from further research, education, and clinical experience must promote appropriate use and enable doctors to avoid sophisticated imaging when the results will not influence the course of treatment. The radiographic evaluation of glenohumeral arthrosis the use of imaging techniques in planning prosthetic glenohumeral arthroplasty, and the role of imaging in followup evaluations of prosthetic arthroplasty are discussed. The preferred approaches to these subjects are presented and clinical cases are used to highlight the important and interesting principles."
CD009020,0,7824983,1,Diagnosis of partial and complete rotator cuff tears using combined gradient echo and spin echo imaging.,"Most magnetic resonance (MR) studies evaluating the rotator cuff for tears have used T2-weighted imaging in the coronal oblique and sagittal oblique planes. T2*-weighted gradient echo imaging, however, has advantages over spin echo imaging, including contiguous slices without cross-talk, high contrast around the cuff, and intrinsically shorter imaging times which can be used to increase the number of signals averaged and thus improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We reviewed the shoulder MR scans of 87 consecutive patients who underwent both a MR scan and a shoulder arthroscopy during which the size of tears, if present, was graded. The reviewers were blinded as to the history and arthroscopic results. The MR scans included oblique coronal T2*-weighted gradient echo and oblique sagittal T2-weighted spin echo images. MR cuff grades were correlated with arthroscopic findings. For complete tears, the sensitivity of MR was 0.91 and the specificity 0.95. For partial tears, the sensitivity was 0.74 and the specificity 0.87. This accuracy is similar to two-plane T2-weighted imaging as previously reported in the literature. There was a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.0005) between the cuff grade as determined by MR and the arthroscopic findings."

We retrospectively reviewed and correlated the MR features with arthroscopic findings in 21 symptomatic patients who had fluid in the SAB on MR imaging without demonstrable rotator cuff tear. Rotator cuff impingement was the most frequent surgical finding (42.9%). Other frequent surgical observations were glenoid labrum abnormality (28.6%), bursitis (19%), and supraspinatus tendinitis (14.3%). Distribution of acromial types was similar to that reported by Bigliani et al., and impingement was evenly distributed among acromial types in our study population. We conclude that in our patient population group the MR finding of isolated SAB fluid in symptomatic patients is highly likely to be associated with the finding of other abnormalities in the shoulder joint at surgery."

Acromioclavicular joint conditions play a major role (well over 50%) in initiating the process. This study was aimed at assessing the value of acromioclavicular investigations during shoulder US studies. September 1992 to September 1993, a hundred and seventy-four patients with shoulder pain underwent US exams of both shoulders and acromioclavicular joints. In 62% of patients rotator cuff tears (from less to more severe) were demonstrated, in 48% biceps tendon conditions (effusion, tendonitis, dislocation or tear) and in 31% aspecific degenerative changes of the rotator cuff. Three acromioclavicular joint cysts, a clavicular fracture and an acromioclavicular dislocation were also observed. The patients with US patterns of acromioclavicular conditions were 105 (60%); in 38% of cases, only capsular hypertrophy due to joint degeneration was observed. In 22% of cases the latter was associated with arthrosis-like changes of the articular rim. In 63% of cases rotator cuff tears were associated and in 37% of cases there were aspecific degenerative cuff changes.

An increase in thickness of the rotator cuff as well as synovitis and bursitis were documented. Twenty shoulders demonstrated a mean thickness of 8.05 mm. Most often, the signal intensity of T2 and T1 weighted images was intermediate, and T1 images failed to show an uptake of gadolinium. Of the 24 shoulders, 20 had subacromial subdeltoid bursitis and 21 had glenohumeral synovitis. These results indicate that MRI is of help in the early diagnosis of arthropathy in long term hemodialyzed patients. Magnetic resonance imaging findings are more precise than those of ultrasound, particularly for thickness measurements. Moreover, MRI films are easier to read and permit the detection of synovial involvements. The therapeutic value of MRI lies in the fact that it can isolate the two principal causes of shoulder pain in hemodialyzed patients. The increase in cuff thickness leading to impingement syndrome can be treated by surgical decompression; the synovitis can be treated by radioisotope synovectomy."

Conservative versus operative.,"Primary shoulder dislocation in patients older than 40 years of age is frequently benign, but may be associated with significant rotator cuff or nerve injury. A series of such patients was observed to determine an effective treatment algorithm. Treatment of those dislocations associated with fractures of the greater tuberosity was determined by the fracture pattern. Four patients with glenoid fractures were all treated operatively. Patients without associated fractures were classified according to the absence or presence of significant pain or weakness after 3 weeks. Of 27 patients who were symptom free at 3 weeks, only four had associated problems after 3 months. All of 13 patients complaining of weakness or pain after 3 weeks had significant associated lesions (11 rotator cuff tears, 2 cuff tears plus neurologic deficit). The persistence of significant pain or weakness 3 weeks after primary dislocation in this age group is an indication for further investigation (arthrography or ultrasound). While recurrent instability is relatively uncommon, rotator cuff repair when appropriate in medically fit patients resulted in pain relief and return of strength."
CD009020,0,8020233,0,Functional and anatomical results after rotator cuff repair.,"The anatomic condition of the rotator cuff and the functional results obtained were studied in a homogeneous series of 100 full thickness cuff tears in 98 patients with an average followup of 4 years. Constant's functional score, used by the European Society for Shoulder and Elbow Surgery, was done preoperatively and postoperatively in each patient, in addition to ultrasonography at followup. There was a close correlation between the anatomic condition of the cuff and Constant's functional score before surgery (p = 0.0063) and after repair, irrespective of the type of tear repaired (p = 0.0012) or the sonographic appearance of the cuff at followup (p = 0.0001). Ultrasonography showed 65% intact cuffs, 11% intact but thinned cuffs, and 24% recurrent defects. Three predisposing factors for recurrence were noted: size of tear to be repaired (p = 0.0001) accounted for 57%, age (p = 0.063) for 25%, and degree of occupational use for 18%. The functional results obtained were more related to the anatomic condition of the repaired cuff at followup than to the tear size at surgery. Predictive clinical factors for recurrence included overall Constant's functional score, reduced ability to perform daily activities, reduced active flexion, abduction and external rotation, and loss of muscular strength. Constant's functional score reflected the functional results with accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility. Additional ultrasonography appears necessary to specify the exact size of the recurrent defect and to distinguish between certain anatomic types, such as thinned cuffs, which can give rise to difficult problems in manual workers after defect repair."

CD009020,0,8042491,1,Intraarticular findings in the chronically painful shoulder. A study of 32 posttraumatic cases.,"32 consecutive patients suffering from chronic shoulder pain for more than 6 months after a single, nondislocating shoulder trauma were examined clinically and by special radiographs, dynamic sonography, MRI and arthroscopy. Typical complaints were pain during loading, especially during over the head activities. Symptoms of a ""dead arm"" and instability were also present. Patients with previous dislocations, traumas or radiographic signs of degenerative shoulder lesions were excluded. The patients had a decreased active range of motion and positive signs of apprehension and impingement, but only 4 had clinical signs of shoulder instability. Diagnostic evaluation identified labral tears, partial and total rotator cuff lesions with subacromial impingement and tendinitis of the biceps tendon. Surgery was performed in 24 patients, using capsulolabral and rotator cuff reconstruction, arthroscopic labral resection and open subacromial decompression. In conclusion, patients with chronic posttraumatic shoulder pain have intraarticular injuries, especially tears of the glenoid labrum. History, clinical findings, radiography and sonography are seldom diagnostic. MRI is valuable, particularly for identification of labral pathology, but arthroscopy appears necessary for a preoperative assessment."

Sonography was performed immediately after MR imaging, so that the information obtained by MR imaging could be applied to sonographic diagnosis. Twenty patients were diagnosed from T2-weighted images as having complete tears of the rotator cuff. Sonography showed full-thickness anechoic areas in 12 of the 20 patients, heterogeneous hyperechoic areas in seven, and no abnormal findings in the other one. Thirteen patients were diagnosed as having incomplete tears with MR imaging. Sonography showed heterogeneous hyperechoic areas in 12, but no abnormal findings in one of the 13. Hyperechoic areas in the rotator cuff were shown in four of eight patients who had been diagnosed from T2-weighted images as not having tears. We consider full-thickness anechoic areas to be specific findings of complete tears, although some patients with rotator cuff tears did not show this finding."

The main purpose of the present study has been to determine the echographic criteria of the most frequent shoulder periarticular soft tissue pathology. A prospective study has been carried out, comparing the right to the left shoulder of 37 normals in order to determine the normal characteristics and limits of the selected echographic parameters (echogenicity, echostructure, dimensions in terms of width, rhythm of movement and rotator cuff competence ratio). Afterwards, the relative role of these variables in the identification of three different nosological groups determined through suitable gold standard diagnostic methods (36 suprasinatus tears, 20 supraspinatus tendinitis and 22 subacromial bursitis) has been determined. Lastly, the discriminant power of some echographic parameters association was tested, thus suggesting the echographic criteria to be selected. Results support the following criteria: 1) supraspinatus tears: cuff competence ratio less than 1, the difference value between the affected and the sound tendon thickness less than -1,8 mm associated with asymmetries of one of the remaining parameters (echogenicity, echostructure or rhythm); 2) supraspinatus tendinitis: the difference between the affected and the sound tendon thickness bigger than 1 mm associated with asymmetries of one of the remaining parameters (echogenicity, echostructure or rhythm); cuff competence ratio equal or above 1;3) subacromial bursitis: the difference between the affected and the sound bursa thickness bigger than 1 mm associated with asymmetries of one of the following parametres: echogenicity, echostruture or rhythm."

The judicious and appropriate use of diagnostic imaging studies requires a thoughtful and thorough evaluation of the data obtained from these studies and their correlation to the patient's symptoms, history, mechanism of injury, and physical findings.

Etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.","We report a series of ossific lesions of the posterior inferior glenoid in a group of elite baseball players. We hope to clarify the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the Bennett lesion. From August 1985 to August 1991, we identified six professional baseball pitchers and one college pitcher with evidence of ossification of the shoulder on plain radiographs, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Arthroscopic examination was performed in all cases. All seven players had identifiable posterior labral injury on arthroscopic examination; six of these seven also had varying degrees of undersurface posterior rotator cuff damage. No anterior tissue damage, anterior instability, or subacromial impingement was noted. No ossification was identified arthroscopically. Intraarticular labral and rotator cuff tears were debrided arthroscopically and patients underwent rehabilitation for 4 to 6 months after surgery. Six of the seven athletes returned to preinjury performance levels; however, one pitcher is no longer playing competitive baseball. The Bennett lesion is an extraarticular posterior ossification associated with posterior labral injury and posterior undersurface rotator cuff damage. It is not, however, a result of traction stresses in the region of the triceps insertion. Recognition is important for identification and treatment of the lesion and associated pathologic damage."
CD009020,0,8180457,0,Distribution of normal and abnormal fluid collections in the glenohumeral joint: implications for MR arthrography.,"Although magnetic resonance (MR) images of the glenohumeral joint frequently demonstrate intraarticular fluid, no specific criteria have, to the authors' knowledge, been published that allow accurate assessment of the amount of fluid present. Also, despite the increasing use of MR arthrography of the shoulder, the optimal amount of intraarticular fluid that should be used with this technique has not been determined. The authors progressively distended the glenohumeral joint in six cadaveric shoulder specimens with a dilute gadopentetate dimeglumine solution and obtained MR images after injection of 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mL of the solution. The pattern of fluid distribution was evaluated, and these results were then used to estimate the amount of fluid that was present in the glenohumeral joint on MR images of 20 shoulders obtained in 12 asymptomatic volunteers. In 14 of these shoulders, intraarticular fluid was present; however, in none was more than 2 mL evident. Results of the cadaveric study also indicated that 15 mL of intraarticular fluid appears to be the optimal amount for MR arthrography."
CD009020,0,8178178,0,[Criteria for legal assessment of rotator cuff rupture].,"The judgement of the correlation between an accident and a rotator cuff tear has an important role in legal and private accident insurance. Owing to the high morbidity of degenerative alterations and ruptures of the rotator cuff tendons, the causality of an acute traumatic rupture can be difficult to demonstrate, which means assessments are often controversial. In a retrospective study we evaluated 25 orthopaedic assessments and tried to find rules for an objective estimation. The judgement of correlation between trauma and rotator cuff tear should be based on four pillars: history, trauma mechanism, initial findings and course of the functional deficit. Possible mechanisms of traumatic rupture are discussed from various angles. Important clinical findings, e.g. a functional supraspinatus deficit, should be fully documented. X-Rays of both shoulders can lead to indirect demonstration of preexistent changes in the rotator cuff. Sonographic evaluation can show up the rotator cuff tear and demonstrate signs of acute injury. After persistent pain and functional deficit, in a few cases operative and microscopic findings will lead to a correct estimate of causality. Because of the diagnostic uncertainty a 20-point score is introduced for retrospective assessment of the history (2 points), trauma mechanism (3 points), initial clinical, radiological and sonographic findings (10 points) and course of functional deficit (5 points) to evaluate the role of trauma in rotator cuff tears. Using this score trauma can be classified as the main or partial cause or as irrelevant to the pathogenesis of rotator cuff tears."

CD009020,0,8126038,1,Ultrasonography and arthrography in the diagnosis of tears of the rotator cuff.,"The accuracy of ultrasonography and arthrography in the prediction of lesions of the rotator cuff was evaluated and compared with the operative findings in a retrospective study of forty-nine patients (forty-nine shoulders). In the detection of full-thickness (stage-III) tears of the rotator cuff, ultrasonography had an over-all sensitivity of 74 per cent, a specificity of 95 per cent, an accuracy of 84 per cent, a predictive value of a positive test of 95 per cent, and a predictive value of a negative test of 75 per cent. In contrast, arthrography demonstrated a sensitivity of 93 per cent, a specificity of 95 per cent, an accuracy of 94 per cent, a predictive value of a positive test of 96 per cent, and a predictive value of a negative test of 91 per cent. Ultrasonography could not reliably differentiate between partial (stage-II) and full-thickness (stage-III) tears. Lesions of the long head of the biceps brachii tendon were recorded by ultrasonography for twenty-two patients (45 per cent) and by arthrography for eleven patients (22 per cent). The ultrasonographic finding of fluid in the sheath of this tendon is not a reliable sign of a lesion in the tendon."
CD009020,0,7920064,1,Magnetic resonance imaging of rotator cuff lesions.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in rotator cuff diseases. Forty consecutive patients studied by MRI from September 1990 to September 1992 were included in the study. MRI was performed on a 1.5 tesla MR scanner. Each MRI study was reviewed by two radiologists experienced in rotator cuff tendons. The MRI finding was compared with the surgical result. MRI sensitivity for all tears (partial and complete) was 1.0 (22/22), specificity 0.89 (16/18), accuracy rate 0.95 (38/40), and the predictive value 0.92 (22/24). Signal changes of the rotator cuff tendon (primary signs) were the most reliable criteria in diagnosis of the tear. Changes of subacromial and subdeltoid fat planes and bursa (secondary signs) were complimentary when primary signs were indeterminant. The direction of the long axis of abnormal signal intensity in the rotator cuff tendon may be a good indicator when differentiating tears from tendinitis. We conclude that MRI shows excellent performance in the determination of the presence or absence of a rotator cuff tear."
CD009020,0,8191450,0,[Evaluation of the rotator cuff with magnetic tomography].,"Rotator cuff tears are difficult to diagnose clinically, both in the acute and the chronic phase. Both conservative and surgical treatment give the best results if the injury is detected early. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently been introduced for diagnoses of cuff tears. The purpose of this study was to establish the accuracy of MRI in relation to surgical findings in the same patient group. MRI was used in the diagnosis of 25 patients who later underwent surgery for injury to the rotator cuff. During the surgery, 19 total tears were identified, of which 15 had been described by MRI. MRI showed a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 83%. The predictive value of a positive test was 83%. In experienced hands, MRI is extremely accurate for detecting rotator cuff injuries, but ultrasonography should still be the first method of diagnosis in Norway, because of its accuracy when used by experienced practitioners, and its availability and low cost."
CD009020,0,8312510,0,[Application possibilities of MR arthrography in diseases of the shoulder joint].,In a prospective study possible indications for MR arthrography of the shoulder were evaluated. 37 patients were examined before and after intraarticular administration of a 2-mmolar solution of Gd-DTPA. MR arthrography was performed if there was no joint effusion and/or an uncertain finding concerning the rotator cuff or the capsulolabral complex on plain MR images. MR arthrography leads to a better demonstration of labrum pathology in 11/22 patients and to a superior delineation of the capsuloligamentous apparatus in 20/22 cases. In 9/15 patients with impingement lesions MR arthrography allowed a differentiation of severe tendinitis from partial and small full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff. MR arthrography of the shoulder joint enhances the accuracy of MR in case of an uncertain finding on plain MR images.
CD009020,0,8310926,0,Tears of the anterior portion of the rotator cuff (the subscapularis tendon): MR imaging findings.,"Tears of the most anterior portion of the rotator cuff, the subscapularis tendon, are reported to be uncommon and rarely occur in isolation.

Accordingly, the objective of this study was to describe the MR imaging findings in the shoulders of patients with tears of the subscapularis tendon."
CD009020,0,7912584,1,Correlation between MRI and operative findings of the rotator cuff tear.,"Rotator cuff disease is one of the most common causes of shoulder pain. Various methods have been used to evaluate this problem. In this study, we determine the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulder in diagnosing the rotator cuff tear based on operative findings. Ten patients with a painful shoulder requiring operation received an MRI of the shoulder before surgery. A GE 1.5 Tesla MR scanner with a five-inch planar surface coil was applied and the diagnosis was confirmed by an experienced radiologist in the field of musculoskeletal MRI. All patients underwent surgery within two weeks of MRI examination. Nine of the 10 patients were shown to have rotator cuff tear by MRI. Among the nine MRI positive patients, eight were proven to have such lesions on operation (two massive tears, four moderate complete tears, and two bursal side tears). One false-positive result was found to be an adhesive capsulitis and supraspinatus tendinitis at operation. The remaining case, diagnosed as tendinitis by MRI, turned out to be a small incomplete tear on operation. Therefore, the sensitivity of MRI for rotator cuff tear in this study was 0.89. The overall accuracy was 80%. We concluded that MRI has a high accuracy in detecting the rotator cuff tear. False-positive and false-negative diagnoses were attributed to a severe tendinitis and an incomplete tear, respectively."

CD009020,0,8179927,0,Basic anatomy of the shoulder by magnetic resonance imaging.,"An understanding of the normal magnetic resonance (MR) infrastructural details of musculotendinous elements of the rotator cuff forms the basis for analysis of its pathology. The muscular bellies of the teres minor, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, and subscapularis are easily identified in MR images. In their lateral course both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles transition to tendons gradually. Their lateral tendinous portions partially overlap and form a layered appearance on MR images. The subscapularis, with its fan-like tendinous insertional slips at the lesser tuberosity, can be identified easily in all imaging planes. The ligamentous structures of the shoulder, including the coracoacromial and coracohumeral ligaments, are visualized as low signal bands in all imaging planes. The capsuloligamentous structures including the superior, middle, and inferior glenohumeral ligament and glenoid labrum present considerable anatomic variations. This is especially true with respect to the anterior labrum, which varies from absent to a well-formed triangular appearance. Understanding the basic MRI anatomy of all soft tissue structures of the shoulder is essential for appropriate interpretation of lesions related to the shoulder."
CD009020,0,8179926,0,Computed arthrotomography of glenohumeral instability.,"In spite of recent advances in imaging technology, computed arthrotomography continues to be a useful imaging modality for shoulder evaluation.

Computed arthrotomography remains a simple and reliable method for evaluation of the glenoid labrum in patients with shoulder instability."

In experienced hands, it is as sensitive as arthrography and magnetic resonance imaging for detecting rotator cuff tears and abnormalities of the biceps tendon. Because sonography is rapid, noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, and capable of performing bilateral examinations in one sitting, it should be used as the initial imaging test when the primary question is one of rotator cuff or biceps tendon abnormalities."

CD009020,0,8128027,0,[Posterosuperior glenoid rim impingement in athletes: the diagnostic value of traditional radiology and magnetic resonance].,"First described by Walch in 1991, the posterosuperior glenoid rim impingement syndrome is a major condition in the differential diagnosis of shoulder pain occurring in the athletes engaged in repetitive and loading movements of abduction and extra-rotation of the dominant upper limb. Thirty-eight athletes with these dynamic athletic characteristics, referred for unexplained shoulder pain and with a clinical diagnosis of posterosuperior glenoid rim impingement syndrome, underwent radiography and MR examinations, with excellent final results. Radiography was capable of depicting the abnormal skeletal features of this kind of impingement, thus allowing a preliminary diagnosis to be made. MRI excelled in diagnosing the lesions in the deep surface of the supraspinatus tendon and in the posterior labrum secondary to impingement. The static and the kinematic sequences with the arm in abduction and extrarotation proved to be the best ones to define the physiopathologic phases of impingement. Thus, we conclude that invasive diagnostic procedures are not necessary for the correct and unquestionable diagnosis of posterosuperior glenoid rim impingement syndrome."
CD009020,0,8054232,0,Shoulder joint stability after arthroscopic subacromial decompression.,"In 55 patients with type I or type II impingement lesions we performed arthroscopic subacromial decompression. Fifty-two patients are followed up 1 year postoperatively. In all patients the condition of the affected shoulder before and after decompression was documented using a 100-point shoulder score (pain on activity, 15 points; pain without activity, 15 points; function, 20 points; weight lifting, 10 points; muscle strength, 15 points; range of motion, 25 points). At follow-up we also documented the extent of passive inferior shift of the humeral head by ultrasound. The mean score preoperatively was 60.9 (+/- 13.8). Postoperatively there was a significant increase to 84.7 (+/- 12.5). The average postoperative hospital stay was 8.8 days (+/- 2.1). In 12 patients (23%) the postoperative score was less than 85 points, and in these the treatment was considered to have failed. Comparison of these patients as a group with those in whom the treatment was successful revealed no difference in age, a small but not significant difference in the preoperative duration of shoulder complaints, and no difference in the postoperative length of stay in hospital. However, there was a significant difference in the extent of passive inferior shift of the humeral head: in the failure group the mean inferior shift was 4.6 +/- 1.9 mm, while in the other patients the shift was only 2.7 +/- 1.0 mm. This difference was statistically highly significant. There was a statistical highly significant negative Pearson correlation coefficient of -5.56 between postoperative score and inferior shift of the humeral head. We conclude that patients with subacromial pathology and hypermobile glenohumeral joints may not be good candidates for subacromial decompression."
CD009020,0,8047956,0,Two portions of the supraspinatus muscle: a new finding about the muscles macroscopy by dissection and magnetic resonance imaging.,Axial MR images of the shoulder joint reveal a central linear band within the supraspinatus muscle void of signal which seems not to represent the only tendon of this muscle. Due to the importance of the supraspinatus muscle for the painful impingement syndrome of the shoulder we studied the fibrous architecture of this muscle comparing 30 MR images and 49 cadaver dissections. We found the supraspinatus muscle to be composed of two distinct portions. The mean length of the ventral portion is 88 mm and of the dorsal portion 106 mm. The angle of the central tendon which is formed by fibers of both muscle portions relative to the frontal plane is 50 degrees. Both muscle portions probably act differently in moving the arm. This finding seems to be important for the pathophysiology of rotator cuff tears which are mainly located anteriorly within the ventral muscle portion and the eccentric central tendon.

Part I: Spine and upper extremities.,"MRI is valuable in evaluation of tendons and ligaments in sports-related injuries. Tendons and ligaments show dark signal intensity on all MR sequences. Alteration in size, shape, continuity, and signal intensity of these structures can be well visualized with MRI. Impingement syndrome is the leading cause of atrophy and degeneration of the rotator cuff. Shape of the acromion, presence of subacromial spur, and involvement in certain sport activities that lead to shoulder instability may cause impingement of the rotator cuff.

CD009020,0,7875142,0,The effect of prolonged isometric contractions on muscle fluid balance.,"Ultrasound scanning was performed at three sites above the fossa supraspinata on nine healthy subjects and five patients with myofascial shoulder pain. This method produced a well-defined depiction of the soft tissue layers above the fossa supraspinata and reproducible muscle thickness measurements. In the healthy subjects the average distance from the skin surface to the trapezius muscle was 7.7 mm and the average thickness of the trapezius muscle was 5.3 mm, and the average thickness of supraspinatus muscle was 20.0 mm. The supraspinatus muscle was thinner at the medial measuring site than at the other two sites. In contrast, a tendency towards a larger distance was seen from the skin to trapezius muscle at the medial measuring site than at the other two sites. No statistical differences were found between the two groups of subjects either at rest or during brief shoulder abductions. All the subjects performed a 30 degrees unilateral isometric shoulder abduction test to exhaustion. The median endurance time was 33 min for the healthy subjects and only 5 min for the patients. The ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were in line with this, since the increment in RPE with time was larger for the patients than for the healthy group. The reduced shoulder abduction endurance time in the patient group may have been related to impaired muscle function and/or pain development. During the 33-min shoulder abduction in the healthy subjects, the thickness of supraspinatus muscle increased by 14%, indicating muscle swelling, whereas the thickness of trapezius muscle remained constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

As MRI assumes an ever increasing role in the imaging evaluation of the painful shoulder, radiologists must be aware of this entity and appreciate the difficulty in diagnosing these tears with MRI. Differentiation of a true rotator interval tear from normal synovium and capsule in this space is most likely not possible with MRI, and symptoms may be referred and misleading.

Such patients not only have a higher incidence of systemic disease, but also--as we know from autopsies--a large percentage of rotator cuff tears. These changes--with the exception of small partial tears--can be recognized sonographically with a high degree of certainty. Prospective sonographic studies have provided us with information that the incidence of rotator cuff tears rises from 25% in patients in their fifties to 50% in patients in their seventies. These studies enabled us to explain the hitherto unknown clinical relevance of these changes. In general, the patients complained of little pain, but when large tears were present, there was usually a clear loss of function, which however was astonishingly well tolerated. These findings would call for caution in indicating complicated reconstructive surgery."

T1-weighted MR images were obtained with and without fat suppression after intraarticular injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Without fat suppression, overall accuracy was 84%. False-positive full-thickness tears were diagnosed in three patients who were proved to have partial tears. False-negative normal tendons were diagnosed in two patients who had partial tears. The corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 90% and 75%, respectively. With the aid of fat-suppressed imaging, full-thickness and partial cuff tears were identified with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Fat-suppressed images also showed intratendinous contrast material imbibition in three torn cuffs with frayed, friable tendon margins. Fat suppression in MR arthrography is valuable in the differentiation of partial from full-thickness cuff tears and in the detection of small partial tears of the inferior tendon surface."
CD009020,0,8273012,0,[Instability and impingement of the shoulder of the high performance athlete in overhead stress].,"The present prospective study was performed on 89 competitive sportsmen (league players of handball, basketball, volleyball and water polo). The evaluation was based on information obtained from a review of training methods, a standardised anamnestic, physical and sonographic examination directed at pain, function, flexibility and all signs of impingement and instability of the shoulder counted in a score. The incidence of shoulder pain, which handicapped during training and play within the last 6 months was for water polo 60%, handball 40%, volleyball 25% and basketball 3.5%. Analysing these problems we found severe problems predominantly in handball, fewer in water polo or volleyball. According to data obtained from sports with throwing activity we found a high incidence of shoulder disorders. Using basketball players as a control group with less throwing activity our results would suggest that this mechanism seems to be the most important. The high incidence of severe disorders in handball players is additionally caused by traumatic injuries. Ultrasonography shows predominantly incomplete tears of the deep surface of the supraspinatus tendon near to the insertion with exception of the basketball players. Only in 5 shoulders (2.8%) we found the coincidence of clear signs of instability and subacromial pathology. The term ""instability impingement"" has not proved to be very helpful and has turned out to be far too diffuse to establish a diagnosis."
CD009020,0,8273011,0,[Magnetic resonance morphologic changes in shoulder joints of world class water polo players].,"In a prospective study we examined the dominant shoulder of 11 athletes from the 1992 German Olympic water polo team. Their mean age was 25.4 +/- 3.5 years. Water polo had been practised generally for 14.1 +/- 4.3 years and professionally for 11.6 +/- 3.9 years. The weekly training amounted to between 12.5 and 19.5 hours. All athletes were submitted to standardised clinical, sonographical and MRI tests. In 5 cases we found anamnestic and/or clinical indications of rotator cuff pathology. In all 5 cases the supraspinatus tendon was affected, and in three cases both the supra- and the infraspinatus tendon were involved. Sonographically, no specific pathology except a thickened rotator cuff was seen. Remarkable changes were revealed by magnetic resonance imaging. In 8 cases changes were present in the insertion of the rotator cuff at the humeral head. The subacromial bursa was not pathologic. The tendon of the long head of the biceps was pathologically changed in 9 cases. In 7 athletes a so-called biceps halo and in two an osteophyte in the area of the bicipital groove was visible. In all of the 11 dominant shoulder joints massive hypertrophy of the articular capsule and pathologic changes of the anterior glenoid labrum existed. Occult osseous lesions were detected in 5 athletes, and osseous lesions of the humeral head in 8 athletes. In all athletes we could document degenerative changes at the acromioclavicular joints such as effusion in 7 cases, arthritis in two cases, and evident synovitis in two cases."
CD009020,0,7584215,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of impingement and rotator cuff disorders. A surgical perspective.,"In conclusion, the clinical picture of impingement syndrome is one of a continuum occurring as a result of compression of the bursa and rotator cuff within the subacromial space. In its early stages nonoperative management will often suffice, but in resistant cases and in cuff tears operative intervention is often indicated. The usefulness of MR imaging has greatly expanded for the orthopaedist diagnosing and treating the patient with impingement. After careful clinical evaluation and plain radiographs, MR imaging can significantly add to our knowledge as to the extent of the disease process. This added information can aid in tailoring an individualized treatment regimen and can be invaluable in the preoperative planning for patients with rotator cuff pathology."
CD009020,0,7584214,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of impingement and rotator cuff tears.,"This article addresses the role of MR imaging in the spectrum of impingement and rotator cuff tears. Rotator cuff and coracoacromial arch anatomy, the cause of impingement syndrome, and the pathology and imaging of calcific tendinitis are reviewed."
CD009020,0,7584213,0,Pathogenesis of rotator cuff disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics.,"In summary, rotator cuff pathology is a continuum that begins with degeneration of collagen fibers at a rate that exceeds that of repair. The degenerative process is accelerated with aging, chronic inflammatory diseases, impingement, and repetitive activity. A tendon weakened by disease may then be torn by routine physical activity. MR imaging can help predict which patients are at risk for rotator cuff disease because of abnormal anatomy and can detect the disease at an early stage so that the progression may be altered before a tear occurs."
CD009020,0,7584208,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of the postoperative shoulder.,"The use of MR imaging in the evaluation of the postoperative shoulder and the findings indicative of postoperative pathology remain largely unexplored. MR imaging does seem to be diagnostic of complete rotator cuff tears following cuff repair. In all postoperative cases, a key to differentiating the expected from the pathologic is to be familiar with the procedure that was performed."

With application of appropriate MRI protocol/sequences and familiarity with applied shoulder MRI anatomy, valuable diagnostic information may be derived that can greatly assist management/therapy of common problems, such as rotator cuff tears, impingement, and instability as well as less frequent causes of shoulder pain and dysfunction."
CD009020,0,8346359,0,"[Echography, magnetic resonance and double-contrast arthrography of the rotator cuff. A prospective study in 30 patients].","Shoulder pain is a common clinical problem with different etiologies. Without a specific diagnosis, treatment could be ineffective, causing functional limitation, chronic pain and atrophy. US and MRI allow in many cases to correctly define the different etiologies causing shoulder pain, often due to rotator cuff conditions. From June to September 1992, thirty patients with clinically suspected acute or chronic rotator cuff lesion were studied with US, MRI and double contrast arthrography. US and MRI findings were evaluated and compared using arthrography and surgery as the gold standard. The overall accuracy of MRI was 93%: the method yielded accurate information about size and number of rotator cuff tears, and about bursal, bone and muscle involvement. US accuracy was 83% in the diagnosis of large tears, 63% in the diagnosis of small and partial tears and only 11% in the diagnosis of tendinitis. Both MRI and arthrography exhibited high accuracy (respectively 91 and 100%) in the detection of rotator cuff tears when their results were compared with surgical findings. A flow chart to be used in the patients with acute or chronic shoulder pain was drawn from the critical analysis of the above results."
CD009020,0,8331246,0,Kinematic MRI of the shoulder.,"Clinical evaluation of shoulder pain can be difficult. Pain in the shoulder is often dynamic/positional, and it can often be elicited only during specific activity or function. Soft tissue deforms or changes in shape through motion. These complex interrelationships at the glenoid humeral joint require dynamic studies to accurately evaluate normal anatomy and abnormal pathology. The objective of our study was to evaluate the use of a dynamic cyclic cine imaging to evaluate the glenoid humeral joint."
CD009020,0,8504591,0,The treatment of posterior subluxation in athletes.,"Posterior instability in athletes is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Athletes have recurrent posterior subluxations rather than true dislocations, and they have pain rather than instability, which makes the diagnosis difficult. The pathology is usually capsular laxity rather than a true reverse Bankart lesion. There is not one diagnostic test, including computed tomography (CT) arthrogram, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or arthroscopy, that will always help with the diagnosis. Most athletes respond to conservative care with an exercise program designed to strengthen the posterior deltoid, the infraspinatus, and the teres minor; but, there is still a select group of athletes that cannot perform their sport after an extensive rehabilitation program. The surgical options for these athletes are varied, and the results in most cases are less than ideal. A posterior capsulorrhaphy was performed to treat this problem. This was initially performed with a staple, but this technique has been abandoned for a suture capsulorrhaphy to avoid staple problems. The 40 athletes treated operatively that had adequate follow-up evaluation reflected a 40% failure rate. Most of the failures were related to ligamentous laxity and unrecognized multidirectional instability not treated at the time of surgery. There may be subtle differences between a patient with posterior subluxation and multidirectional instability; these must be differentiated before operation. Also, the higher the competitive level of athlete, the worse the overall results. The high-level athlete must be informed that even if his or her shoulder is stabilized, the functional results may not allow him or her to continue at the same competitive level."

We report a cross-sectional ultrasonographic (US) evaluation of supraspinatus tendons' (SST) and femoral neck capsules' (FNC) thickness in 49 patients on long-term hemodialysis. Normal values for SST and FNC were defined in control subjects. Among the 49 patients, aged 21 to 86 (median 59) years at the time of US, dialyzed for 1 to 228 (median 97) months, 33 had at least one abnormal joint. The prevalence of patients with at least one or at least two abnormal joints, the number of abnormal joints per patient and the thickness of SST and FNC increased significantly with dialysis duration (P < 0.001 for all parameters considered). All (N = 11) patients with radiological and/or histological evidence of dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) had thickened SST and/or FNC. Twenty-two other patients without similar evidence of DRA also had thickened FNC and/or SST. Three died; post-mortem examination demonstrated that US abnormalities were due to beta 2m amyloid infiltration. We suggest that SST and FNC thickness, measured by US, is a useful, non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of DRA."
CD009020,0,8509471,0,A practical guide to diagnostic imaging of the upper extremity.,"Imaging of the upper extremities can be challenging and rewarding. Newer imaging modalities, including MRI and CT, have greatly expanded the ability of the radiologist to define soft-tissue abnormalities in the wrist, especially triangular fibrocartilage tears and carpal and radioulnar instability. MRI of the shoulder has almost replaced the arthrogram for diagnosing rotator cuff tears. The plain film, however, remains the mainstay of bone imaging and is the most efficacious first step in the diagnostic work-up. The radionuclide scan, although nonspecific, may provide a map for the radiologist to locate occult lesions. Dialogue between the surgeon and radiologist is essential to effective upper extremity evaluations. The radiologist can maximize his or her effectiveness by performing a brief history and physical examination of the patient."
CD009020,0,8475294,0,Hooked acromion: prevalence on MR images of painful shoulders.,"An association between the morphology of the acromion and the occurrence of rotator cuff tear (RCT) has been suggested by findings at both pathologic examination and routine radiography. As a tomographic technique, magnetic resonance (MR) assessment of acromial shape may be more accurate than routine radiography. The authors studied acromial morphology on sagittal oblique MR images of a control population (47 shoulders), of patients with isolated impingement (30 shoulders), and of patients with full-thickness RCTs (34 shoulders) to assess the association of acromial shape with disorders of the rotator cuff. Acromions were classified as flat (type 1), smoothly curved (type 2), or hooked (type 3). Data were collected by two observers, blinded to clinical and surgical information, who acted in consensus. Patients with RCT had a significantly increased prevalence of type 3 acromions compared with control patients (62% vs 13%, P < .001). Type 3 acromions tended to be more prevalent in the group with impingement (30%, P = .17). There was no significant difference in the distribution of acromion types among control patients with respect to age or gender."
CD009020,0,8332795,0,[Echography in diseases of the rotator cuff].,"The diagnostic accuracy of shoulder US was investigated in 69 patients with a ""painful shoulder"" and the results compared with those of MR imaging. In our experience, US exhibited 95% sensitivity, 69% specificity, 83% positive predictive value, 90% negative predictive value and 85% accuracy. The analysis of the single US patterns proved the difficult distinction of small tears from focal tears, whereas complete ruptures were always easy to identify. In summary, all cases of rotator cuff degeneration or tear were always detected but not always correctly identified. False negatives on US included inflammatory processes of cuff structures but never ruptures or degenerations. Therefore, in our diagnostic protocol, US appeared to be a valuable screening method in the exclusion of rotator cuff injuries; other imaging techniques--i.e., arthrography, MR imaging, arthroscopy--were employed only in questionable/positive cases on US."
CD009020,0,8462039,0,Intravenous administration of gadolinium in the evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis of the shoulder.,"The authors sought to determine the utility of intravenously administered gadolinium chelates in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis of the shoulder. One shoulder was examined for each of 12 patients--6 men and 6 women, ranging in age from 48 to 71 (average 63) years--with well-established disease. The patients had had the disease for 1 to 25 (average 13) years. Static MRI was performed before and after infusion of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) (0.1 mmol/kg body weight); T1-weighted or proton-density images (repetition time [TR] 600 to 1000 ms, echo time [TE] 15 to 30 ms) were obtained. Images obtained after enhancement were particularly useful in the differentiation of pannus from fluid and also allowed improved delineation of tears of the supraspinatus tendon. In addition, contrast-enhanced dynamic gradient-echo spoiled GRASS sequences (TR 50 ms, TE 11 ms, flip angle 70 degrees) were obtained for all patients; for these sequences the same slice was imaged repeatedly at 20-second intervals. The rate of increase of signal intensity in abnormal synovium varied from 0.64 to 5.83 (average 2.30, standard deviation [SD] 1.67) units/second; the enhancement factor ranged from 1.55 to 4.64 (average 2.63, SD 0.98). The authors conclude that for imaging the shoulder enhancement with Gd-DTPA allows improved distinction between synovial thickening and joint effusion and may improve assessment of the rotator cuff. The wide range in the rate of signal increase and total enhancement during dynamic imaging probably reflected heterogeneity in the study population."
CD009020,0,8322068,0,[Ultrasound in inflammatory rheumatic joint diseases].,"Inflammatory changes of the shoulder joint could be detected at a very early stage, when the clinical and radiological examinations were unremarkable. In 50% of the cases a rupture of the rotator cuff could be demonstrated. Only 10% of the shoulder joints had normal sonographic findings, whereas 50% were normal on clinical or radiological examination. Synovitis and effusion of the hand can be diagnosed very well by clinical examination, and can be documented in ultrasound. The sonographic diagnostic accuracy in tendon ruptures of the hand is lower than accuracy of the clinical examination. New technical developments may yield better results. Inflammatory changes of the hip joint are very difficult to diagnose by clinical examination. Synovitis, effusion and changes of the capsule can be better detected by ultrasound. Sonography of the hip joint has become part of our routine diagnostic programme, especially because early changes of the joint do not present clear symptoms."
CD009020,0,8322066,0,[Determining normal ultrasound values of the supra- and infraspinatus muscles].,"Sonographic investigations concerning thickness of tendons (in longitudinal sections) and muscles (in resting position and isometric contraction) were performed on 60 volunteers without shoulder complaints. Increase in muscle thickness within isometric contraction did not depend on thickness in resting position. There was no side difference in tendon thickness. Since the observed values (median 4-5 mm) were far below measurements cited in the greater part of literature, we tried to verify our data by sonographic and anatomic examination of shoulders of corpses. We conclude that, by standardising, thickness measurement of tendons and muscles might become more important in diagnosis of shoulder complaints."
CD009020,0,8475398,0,[Nuclear magnetic tomography in shoulder dislocation].,"Sixty-two patients with anterior shoulder dislocations were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After a primary dislocation, 30 patients showed 23 (77%) tears of the glenoid labrum, 13 (45%) anterior-inferior separation of the capsula, 24 (83%) Hill-Sachs lesions, 6 fractures of the greater tuberosity and 4 glenoid rim fractures. Thirty-two patients with recurrent shoulder dislocation had 14 (44%) tears and 15 (47%) defects of the glenoid labrum, 16 (50%) anterior-inferior separation of the capsula, 28 (88%) Hill-Sachs lesions and 3 glenoid rim fractures. MRI permits complete non-invasive documentation of glenohumeral instability if joint effusion is present. In the absence of joint effusion, diagnostic accuracy can be improved by application of a contrast medium."
CD009020,0,8475397,0,[The value of sonography in ruptures of the rotator cuff].,"In 375 patients ultrasonography of the rotator cuff was carried out before operation. All the patients underwent acromioplasty, either alone or with additional repair of a full-thickness tear. The ultrasound findings were then compared with the intraoperative findings. Two hundred and seventy-two tears of the rotator cuff were seen on ultrasonography, and in 262 cases this was confirmed at operation. In 103 patients no rupture was diagnosed by ultrasound, but in 26 of these cases a full-thickness tear was detected on operation. These figures yield sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 89% and accuracy of 90%; the positive predictive value was 96%, the negative predictive value 75%. In most cases of incorrect evaluation the size of the tears was underestimated by ultrasonography."
CD009020,0,8454760,0,MRI of suprascapular neuropathy in a weight lifter.,"Suprascapular neuropathy results from abnormal compression of the suprascapular nerve, typically at the suprascapular or spinoglenoid notch. This may be produced by either mass effect such as ganglion cyst or by certain repetitive shoulder motions producing wide scapular excursion (e.g., hyperabduction), which causes traction upon the nerve. Certain sports activities such as weight lifting predispose to this type of neuropathy. The clinical presentation is frequently not specific and the patient may be sent for MR evaluation to rule out rotator cuff tear or other more common shoulder abnormalities. This entity should be suspected if MR images demonstrate selective atrophy of the spinatus muscles with a structurally intact rotator cuff."
CD009020,0,8451648,0,[Arthroscopic sub-acromial decompression. Comments on indications and surgical technique].,"Between January 1989 and December 1991 614 arthroscopic subacromial decompressions were performed for impingement syndromes. The first 100 cases represented our learning curve. The first 74 of the remaining 514 cases were available for evaluation and form the basis of the results presented here. Twenty (27.02%) patients were rated stage II in Neer's classification and 54 (72.98%) were rated stage III, 33 (44.59%) of them with a small full-thickness tear (less than 1 cm) and 21 (28.37%) with larger defects. Patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively utilizing the ULCA shoulder score. The average follow-up was 7.9 months. The overall results were satisfactory in 67 cases (90.5%) and unsatisfactory in 7 cases (9.5%). Within the satisfactory group, 28 results (37.8%) were rated excellent and 39 (52.7%) were rated good. In the unsatisfactory group four results (5.4%) were rated fair and three (4.1%) poor. The results in advanced stage III (n = 21), with an average follow-up of 8.4 months, were satisfactory in 20 cases (excellent in 8 and good in 12) and unsatisfactory in one case. It is concluded that arthroscopic subacromial decompression is an effective treatment for both stage II and III impingement syndromes, producing acceptable results that are comparable to those of open procedures. Technically, it seems necessary to perform synovectomy of the ventral synovia in the glenohumeral joint, to resect the coracoacromial ligament completely and also to remove calcifications completely. Depending on the findings of a preoperative sonographic examination of the shoulder joint, the extent of the acromioplasty may be minimized."
CD009020,0,8421748,0,Shoulder after surgery: MR imaging with surgical validation.,"To assess the accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of the shoulder after surgery, MR examinations were performed in 31 patients before repeated surgery, and MR findings were correlated with the subsequent operative findings. In addition, the MR findings associated with prior surgery were reviewed, including altered structure of the acromion, soft-tissue metal artifacts, a surgical trough in the humeral head, nonvisualization of the subacromial-subdeltoid fat stripe, and intermediate signal intensity within the substance of the rotator cuff on images obtained with all pulse sequences. The MR criteria for full-thickness tears in the shoulder after surgery are the presence of fluidlike signal intensity on T2-weighted images that extends through an area of the rotator cuff or the nonvisualization of a portion of the rotator cuff. With use of these criteria, six of seven full-thickness rotator cuff tears were identified at MR imaging, with an accuracy of 90%. Partial cuff tears were indistinguishable from repaired tendons. Findings at MR imaging were 74% accurate concerning the presence of impingement."
CD009020,0,8421747,0,The normal shoulder: common variations that simulate pathologic conditions at MR imaging.,"The appearance of the supraspinatus tendon and anterior capsular mechanism was analyzed in 60 asymptomatic shoulders with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The images were reviewed with special attention to findings that simulate pathologic conditions, as defined by means of currently accepted criteria. On T1-weighted and proton-density (PD) spin-echo (SE) images, intermediate signal intensity was present within the supraspinatus tendon in most shoulders. Focal signal intensity within the distal tendon was particularly common finding, being present in 95% (57 of 60) of shoulders on PD images. Focal obliteration of the subacromial-subdeltoid fat stripe and acromioclavicular joint arthrosis were seen in 95% (57 of 60) and 48% (29 of 60) of the subjects, respectively. There was considerable variation in the shape of the anterior glenoid labrum-glenohumeral ligament (GHL) complex. The labrum may appear triangular, round, crescentic, or absent. The middle and inferior GHLs lie in proximity to the upper half of the anterior labrum; the cleavage plane between the ligaments and the labrum can mimic a tear at MR imaging."
CD009020,0,8101743,0,MR patterns of rotator cuff and labral lesions: comparison between low-field and high-field images.,"Eighteen people (10 men, 8 women) were examined on a 0.3-T (low-field) imager with T1-weighted axial and coronal images and either axial or coronal T2-weighted images. Thirty-two people (22 men, 10 women) were examined on a 1.5-T (high-field) imager with axial T1-weighted images and coronal, sagittal dual-echo images. Rotator cuff lesions were diagnosed by the following findings: abnormal signal in the tendon, irregularity or discontinuity at the musculo-tendinous junction, or muscle abnormality. Glenoid labrum tears were considered if one or more of the following criteria were present: labral deformity of unusual size, focal defect, amputation or displacement with fluid, or capsular stripping. Comparison between the high-field and low-field MR images in the evaluation of rotator cuff lesions suggests that the high-field imager is better than the low-field imager in the differentiation of tendinitis from tears, in the confirmation of bursitis and in detection of subscapularis lesions. A higher contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), less time consumption, and more section planes (especially, sagittal sections) appear to be the main reasons for this. As far as labral lesions are concerned, the performances of the high-field imagers and low-field imagers were almost equal. The artifact of greater chemical shift with a high-field imager would more or less, we assume, degrade the better CNR achievable in the diagnosis of labral lesions."
CD009020,0,8488437,0,Anatomy of the acromial arch: correlation of anatomy and magnetic resonance imaging.,"Based on a retrospective study of 179 MRI records covering four populations (patients presenting with impingement without known injury (n = 90), post-traumatic shoulder pain (n = 28), instability or dislocation (n = 36) and controls (n = 25)), morphologic criteria are suggested to define presumedly normal arches and arches compatible with subacromial impingement. The subacromial arch is presumed normal or without impingement if the sagittal and frontal views show it to be parallel to the humeral head, and/or if there is a fatty layer interposed between the arch and the supraspinatus m. The arch is presumed ""aggressive"" or actually capable of giving rise to impingement if, in either the sagittal or frontal view, there is a zone of narrowing of the subacromial passage with an impression of the arch on the supraspinatus tendon or tendinous thinning at this level or just lateral to this narrowed zone. Based on these criteria, study of the 179 MRI records demonstrated a significant difference of distribution of the arches in the four populations. ""Aggressive"" arches were found in 45.5% of patients with impingement, 25% of patients with posttraumatic pain, 8.9% of patients with an acute or recurrent dislocation and 12% of controls. Conversely, a presumedly normal arch was found in 56% of the controls, 55% of patients with dislocation, 25% of posttraumatic painful shoulders and only 5.5% of patients with clinical impingement. Subacromial impingement may be due to the type 3 acromial dysplasia described by Bigliani or to a thickening of the coracoacromial ligament at its acromial attachment. This study was supplemented by 15 anatomic dissections which confirmed the regularity of attachment of the coracoacromial ligament at the inferior aspect of the acromion along its lateral border."
CD009020,0,8483150,1,[MRI in the pre-operative evaluation of lesions of the rotator cuff].,The authors report a series of 38 patients who had been examined by MRI and then operated for a rotator cuff syndrome. The correlation between the description of the cuff lesions after MRI and the surgical observations were excellent for 37 patients. In one case MRI showed a false image of tear of the supra spinatus m. on its anterior edge. This was due to a bad knowledge of the anatomy of the muscle and tendon and to a poor orientation of the frontal cut plane. This study was complete with MRI and anatomic study of 12 non embalmed cadaveric shoulders. The results showed that MRI was very sensitive (0.93) and specific (0.94) for the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. MRI allowed also to show partial tears of the tendons of the rotator cuff. The authors propose a MRI classification of cuff lesions which permits to establish a good surgical planning.

CD009020,0,8421637,0,Treatment of rotator cuff impingement.,"The author performed 497 shoulder decompression procedures between 1978 and 1989. Of these procedures, 252 (51%) had tears of the rotator cuff that were repaired concomitantly. The results were successful in over 90% of the cases. It is suggested that articular-surface tears or intratendinous tears are the possible cause of some of the failures of the open procedure. The findings also suggest that the use of arthroscopy or magnetic resonance imaging may be indicated in selected cases. However, for the appropriate patient, open shoulder decompression continues to be an excellent treatment."

A diagnostic alternative.,"Office arthroscopy of the shoulder is a technically demanding procedure and is significantly more challenging than office arthroscopy of the knee. With the proper equipment and in the hands of an experienced shoulder arthroscopist, the procedure offers many advantages. Patients unanimously prefer office arthroscopy to MR imaging because of the ability to view their pathology personally in a medium more palatable and understandable than MR imaging. Office arthroscopy appears to be a safe, accurate, and cost-effective alternative to MR imaging for the diagnosis of shoulder pathology in select patients."
CD009020,0,8421610,0,Evaluation and treatment of the rotator cuff.,"The use of the arthroscope for evaluation and treatment of rotator cuff problems is becoming more common. Technology has advanced to the point where we can now not only positively diagnose early rotator cuff problems, but successfully treat them; many times without open shoulder surgery. Arthroscopic cuff debridement and decompression are the mainstays of surgical prevention. Arthroscopic suture fixation of delaminated cuff tears or small rotator cuff avulsions is now possible. The miniopen rotator cuff approach is excellent for repairing most larger full-thickness tears. This article reviews all of these current topics and offers step-by-step surgical techniques used and recommended by the author."

It is not appropriate to consider that all patients, especially young athletes, who have shoulder pain have ""impingement."" Rather, a careful evaluation will result in the correct diagnosis and the institution of the appropriate treatment. A step-by-step assessment and management scheme is necessary for each health care professional dealing with athletes. If surgery is deemed necessary, the correction of the anatomic abnormality with minimal disruption of normal anatomy will be the key to allowing the athlete to return to his or her chosen sport."
CD009020,0,8418972,0,Magnetic resonance arthrography of the shoulder. A new technique of shoulder imaging.,"Although magnetic resonance imaging is very sensitive and even though pathology in the rotator cuff is readily detected, it is often difficult to distinguish between complete rotator cuff tears, partial rotator cuff tears, and area of tendinitis. This article reports the results of a new technique for evaluation of shoulder pathology, which the authors have labeled magnetic resonance arthrography, and compares the results of magnetic resonance arthrography with those of conventional magnetic resonance imaging."
CD009020,0,8416605,1,Sonography of the shoulder in patients with tears of the rotator cuff: accuracy and value for selecting surgical options.,"The management of patients with signs and symptoms referable to the rotator cuff depends on the presence of cuff injury and the size of the tear. Treatment options include conservative nonsurgical management for patients with an intact or partially torn cuff, arthroscopic decompression of the coracoacromial space for those not responding to nonsurgical management, and a range of surgical techniques to repair full-thickness tears. This study was designed to determine whether sonographic evaluation with classification of the extent of cuff injury is accurate for purposes of treatment planning."
CD009020,0,8357686,1,[Possibilities of shoulder arthroscopy in comparison with magnetic resonance tomography and arthro-computerized tomography].,In the last 15 years the methods of examination of the shoulder have intensively expounded. According to a well documented retrospective study we describe the value of the shoulder arthroscopy and its correlation to MRI and arthro-CT findings. MRI represents nowadays the best way of exploring rotator cuff lesions and of investigating an impingement syndrome. Associated with a contrast medium its ability to clear up an anterior or posterior shoulder instability is now superior to the arthro-CT's. The arthroscopy allows the dynamic exploration of the joint and can be used not only as a diagnostic but also as a therapeutic procedure.
CD009020,0,8305104,0,Lesions of the subscapular tendon regarding two cases in arthroscopic surgery.,"Subscapularis tendon lesions in the shoulder are usually difficult to diagnose through clinical examination alone. Isolated subscapularis tendon lesions are infrequent, and most of these injuries are associated with biceps tendon pathology, rotator cuff tears, fractures to the tuberosities, or as a part of an instability complex of the shoulder. All of these other diagnoses over-shadow and complicate the diagnosis of the subscapularis tendon. Although magnetic resonance imaging is frequently effective in evaluating subscapularis tendon tears, arthroscopy is certainly more efficient and affords the additional benefit of allowing surgical treatment of the lesion. The authors present two clinical cases and an update of the literature concerning this unusual lesion."
CD009020,0,8284463,0,[Experimental study of dislocations of the scapulohumeral joint].,"One may produce easily an experimental dislocation (anterior or erecta) of the scapulohumeral joint. The authors discuss, the experimental model then they describe the anatomical lesion produced through the experimental dislocation of 32 shoulders and the correlation observed after RMI assessment of 24 recurrent dislocations. The tear of the inferior glenohumeral ligament is constant, in 20 per cent of the cases the tear lies on the anterior aspect of the glenoid, in the other cases the tear was found on its humeral side. Whatever the situation of the tear of the inferior glenohumeral ligament, the lesion of the labrum was constant. The erecta dislocation was produced with the same movement but with a particular tear of the glenohumeral ligament: the tear was longitudinal. The experimental dislocation needs, in 7 or 8 cases, a desinsertion of the deep aspect of the rotator cuff. The Hill Sachs lesion occurs when the humerus falls along the chest wall after the dislocation. In 50 per cent of the patients, MRI shows modifications of the cuff which are compatible with our results. Hills Sachs lesions appear to be constant after MRI examination."
CD009020,0,8280327,0,Saline magnetic resonance arthrography in the evaluation of glenohumeral instability.,"Sixty-five patients underwent magnetic resonance (MR) shoulder arthrography. Forty-eight of these patients underwent examination under anesthesia (EUA). MR images were retrospectively evaluated for signs felt to be imaging indicators of shoulder instability, including evaluation of various capsular measurements and the presence of glenoid labral tears, as well as Hill-Sachs fractures. Statistical analysis of the results showed that no correlation between capsular indicators with EUA-documented instability was found. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between the presence of a Bankart cartilaginous deformity (p = 0.000) and Hill-Sachs fractures (p = 0.022) with EUA-documented instability. Sensitivity to labral tears was 89% and specificity was 98%, whereas Hill-Sachs fracture detection was 69% and 87%, respectively. We believe that MR saline arthrography is of benefit in the evaluation of the anterior labrum when unenhanced MR imaging is inconclusive, and we speculate on the role of MR arthrography as a primary investigative tool."

We report a cross-sectional ultrasonographic evaluation of supraspinatus tendon and femoral neck capsule thickness in 49 patients on long-term haemodialysis. Ultrasonographic evaluation was repeated 21 +/- 4 (SD) months later in 16 patients. Normal values for the supraspinatus tendon and femoral neck capsule were defined in a group of control subjects without history or signs of joint disease. Among the 49 patients, aged 21-86 (median 59) years, dialysed for 1-228 (median 97) months, 33 had at least one abnormal joint. The prevalence of patients with at least one and at least two abnormal joints, the number of abnormal joints per patient, and the thickness of the supraspinatus tendon and femoral neck capsule increased significantly with dialysis duration (P < 0.001 for all parameters considered). By multiple linear regression analysis, mean thickness of the supraspinatus tendon was positively related to both dialysis duration (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.036) independently. All (n = 11) patients with radiological and/or histological evidence of dialysis-related amyloidosis at the time of ultrasonography had thickened supraspinatus tendon and/or femoral neck capsule; which were also thickened in an additional 22 patients without radiological evidence of dialysis-related amyloidosis. Three died within 5-10 months of the ultrasonographic investigation: post-mortem examination of the periarticular tissue confirmed that the detected thickening was due in all three to beta 2M amyloid infiltration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009020,0,1287844,0,[Ultrasound assessment of reconstructed rotator cuffs].,"The evaluation of recurrent shoulder symptoms in patients who have had rotator cuff repair is a diagnostic challenge. Pain and limitation of motion may be caused by a recurrence of the rotator cuff tear. Arthrography is not considered to be helpful in postoperative cases, since it is false-positive in most of them. Pre-operative ultrasonography of the shoulder is regarded as a highly accurate diagnostic tool for rotator cuff tears. The diagnostic criteria used are: the continuity of the rotator cuff, its contour, its thickness and its echogenicity. Our study was aimed at determining which ultrasonographic criteria were significant for a retear. In addition, the ""normal"" postoperative sonographic appearance of the rotator cuff was established. Of 133 patients with a full thickness rotator cuff tear, 110 were evaluated 4-48 months (mean in 21 months) after surgery. A total of 85 cuffs were reconstructed, in 46 cases by direct suture, in 33 cases by suture to the major tubercle and in 6 cases by tendon transfer (Cofield technique). In 25 cases cuffs the could not be reconstructed. Subacromial decompression was performed routinely. The patients were evaluated clinically by range of movement, force and isometric and impingement tests. The subjective outcome was assessed by the algo-functional index of Patte. Ultrasonography was performed using a 7.5-MHz linear scanner. Each sonographic criterion was referred to the clinical and subjective findings. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the rotator cuffs that could not be reconstructed revealed non-visualization of the tendons. In 13 of the 85 patients in whom reconstruction of the cuff was possible a normal sonographic pattern was seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009020,0,1475420,0,[The incidence and role of the os acromiale in the acromiohumeral impingement syndrome].,"Os acromiale (an apparently supernumerary bone) corresponds to persistence of the lateral end of acromion ossification nucleus over 18 years of age. Os acromiale is articulated with the clavicle and the base of acromion; its incidence is high and often bilateral. A rarer variant is secondary os acromiale, lying between acromion and great humeral tuberosity. Both variants predispose to the onset of pain due to acromiohumeral impingement. Rotator cuff tears are frequently associated due to direct injury to subacromial compartment structures and to overtraction of acromiocoracoid ligament following functional overuse. Three hundred and ninety-eight patients were examined (313 males and 85 females, aged 12 to 71 years): 265 of them underwent conventional radiography with specific projections for the shoulder and 133 underwent CT. Dysplasia was observed in 9.55% of cases (38 patients), which is in agreement with reports by other authors. CT demonstrates the presence of os acromiale better than specific radiographic projections, without requiring painful patient positioning. Axial CT scans allow the depiction of subacromial compartment structures that cannot be demonstrated by US. The evident and frequent association of arthrotic-degenerative acromioclavicular alterations even after os acromiale assimilation confirms the close relationship of the latter bone to rotator cuff conditions, especially to rotator cuff tears. In our opinion, the correct description of this finding has high prognostic value in the subjects likely to experience functional shoulder overuse and allows the correct etiopathogenesis of pain. Therefore CT, which is an elective imaging method especially suited to demonstrate calcium-density structures, thanks to its high spatial and contrast resolution, can be used concurrently with MR imaging because it is less expensive and more easily available."
CD009020,0,1423703,0,Shoulder tendinoses.,"The most common source of shoulder pain is soft-tissue dysfunction. Although fractures of the humerus, scapula, and clavicle are common throughout life, most problems encountered between the ages of 15 and 60 are related to the ligaments, tendons, and muscles of the shoulder girdle. This article deals mainly with tendinitis and tendinosis as primary entities, and to a lesser extent with tendon problems attributable to a primarily bony or ligamentous dysfunction."
CD009020,0,1516301,0,Ultrasonography of rotator cuff tears.,"This is a prospective study of ultrasonography of the rotator cuff mechanism as an alternative to arthrography for screening rotator cuff tears. Seventy-two patients (40 men and 32 women) with possible rotator cuff tears were referred for shoulder arthrography. Before arthrography, bilateral shoulder sonography was performed by a technician under the direction of a radiologist. Arthrograms and sonograms were read separately, and a decision as to the absence or presence of a rotator cuff tear was made without knowledge of the results of the other examination. The results showed 90% sensitivity and 91% specificity, with a positive accuracy of 87%, and a negative accuracy of 93%. Ultrasonography of the rotator cuff is a noninvasive, painless, and cost-effective screening method for patients with a suspected rotator cuff tear."
CD009020,0,1518937,0,Ultrasonography of the shoulder.,"Shoulder sonography has been shown to be an effective noninvasive means of detecting rotator cuff tears and biceps tendon abnormalities. The examination requires careful attention to technique and a thorough knowledge of normal gross and sonographic anatomy. Rotator cuff tears generally cause a diffuse or focal decrease in the space between the humeral head and the deltoid muscle. Therefore, tears are easiest to detect by noting abnormally close apposition of the deltoid and humeral head."
CD009020,0,1421996,0,MRI of the shoulder.,"MR imaging of the shoulder has become an important imaging modality for that joint. Excellent soft tissue contrast and multiplanar acquisition provide optimal assessment of muscle, tendons, hyaline and fibrous cartilage, joint capsules, fat, bursae and bone marrow. The most common indications for shoulder MRI are suspected rotator cuff tear, shoulder instability, osteonecrosis, neoplasm and infection. In this article we describe MR technique, special anatomy of the shoulder, and diagnostic MR criteria of common pathologic conditions."

In a total of 124 patients we examined the shoulder joints by MRI. 69 patients had any kind of subacromial pathology. 55 patients showed a glenohumeral instability. All MRI findings were compared with the surgical findings during arthroscopy and during open surgery. 44 patients showed a recurrent anterior instability, 7 patients showed a multidirectional instability, 2 patients showed a posterior instability, and 2 patients presented acute anterior dislocation. We found significant variability in the labral shape as well as significant variability of anterior capsular attachment. The pathologic changes of the glenoid labrum were classified in four different types. In 78% we found a concomitant Hill-Sachs lesion of various diameter. 5 patients suffered from an additional complete rotator cuff tear. Compared to the intraoperative findings MRI had a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 94%, an accuracy of 94%, a positive predictive value of 91%, and a negative predictive value of 96% in detecting labral pathology."

Marrow edema of the humeral head was found in 16/19 Hill-Sachs lesions and in 4/5 fractures of the greater tuberosity. Two patients presented with a lesion of the long biceps tendon associated with rotator cuff tears and were also subsequently operated upon. MRI performed shortly after primary traumatic shoulder dislocation allows a comprehensive evaluation of the intraarticular lesions and decisively influences further therapy."

(b) The deltoid tendon attachment on the inferior surface of the acromion may simulate a subacromial spur if not imaged in continuity. (c) Fluid in the long head of the biceps tendon sheath is normal if not completely surrounding the tendon. (d) The anterolateral branch of the anterior humeral circumflex vessels in the proximal bicipital groove adjacent to the biceps tendon mimics fluid in the tendon sheath. (e) Continuity or obliteration of the subacromial-subdeltoid bursal fat plane is an unreliable diagnostic sign since the fat plane is often focally absent. (f) Fluid is not detected in subacromial-subdeltoid bursae. (g) Undercutting of the anterior glenoid labrum by hyaline cartilage or a closely apposed middle glenohumeral ligament may simulate an anterior labral tear."

We created a special protocol with axial T1-, T2-, proton-density- and sagittal T1-weighted images. MRI findings such as defects of the glenoid labrum and Hill-Sachs compression fractures proved to be correct during surgery. In the chosen protocol the diagnostic imaging of rotator cuff lesions was not specific. In 10 cases lesions were seen but in only 5 patients did these findings prove to be correct during surgery. However, MRI imaging of glenohumeral joints is a reliable non-invasive diagnostic method."
CD009020,0,1590124,0,MR imaging of the shoulder: appearance of the supraspinatus tendon in asymptomatic volunteers.,"MR imaging has been shown to be accurate in the diagnosis of rotator cuff disruption and tear. Uncertainty remains about the significance of increased signal intensity in the critical zone of the supraspinatus tendon without visible disruption of tendon fibers and about the significance of other secondary findings commonly encountered with rotator cuff abnormalities, such as musculotendinous retraction or obliteration and fluid in the subacromial space. We evaluated proton density-weighted and T2-weighted coronal images (obtained on a 1.5-T superconductive MR imager) of 55 shoulders in 32 asymptomatic volunteers for signal intensity in the supraspinatus tendon, location of the musculotendinous junction, fluid in the subacromial-subdeltoid space, and appearance of the fat plane. In 89% of shoulders, the supraspinatus tendon showed focal, linear, or diffuse increased signal intensity with or without loss of the low-signal-intensity tendon margin on proton density-weighted images. None of these findings were confirmed on T2-weighted images. The musculotendinous junction was always located within an area 15 degrees medial to 30 degrees lateral to the highest point (12 o'clock) on the humeral head convexity. A peribursal fat plane was poorly defined or absent in 49%, and fluid in the subacromial-subdeltoid space was found in 20%. Increased signal intensity in the supraspinatus tendon on proton density-weighted images without a corresponding increase on T2-weighted images, the presence of small amounts of fluid in the subacromial space, and the lack of preservation of the subdeltoid fat plane are common findings in asymptomatic shoulders and by themselves are poor predictors of rotator cuff disease."
CD009020,0,1642033,1,[Arthroscopy and MRT of the shoulder--a comparative retrospective analysis].,"MR Imaging is proving to an effective means for evaluating the shoulder. The use of a surface coil and high resolution scanning techniques have allowed detailed analysis of normal anatomy and suspected pathology of the shoulder. On the other way arthroscopic inspection provides a more extensive visualization of the joint in different positions. 31 patients, well documented, were studied with MR Imaging and correlated with findings in arthroscopy and open revision in some cases. The MR studies were retrospective interpreted without the knowledge of the results of other diagnostic procedures. For the evaluation of rotator cuff tears MRI proved to have a sensitivity of 83.3% and an accuracy of 90.3%. When Arthroscopy was correlated with open revision the sensitivity was 61.8% and the accuracy 78%. Labral pathology and Hill-Sachs lesions will be better evaluated in arthroscopy as in MRI (sensitivity of arthroscopy 100% and of MRI 69%, accuracy of arthroscopy 100% and of MRI 87.1%). With the high resolution scanning technique and a surface coil MRI has been shown to be useful in the evaluation of rotator cuff tears and impingement syndrome but not in diagnosis of labral pathology and Hill-Sachs lesions."
CD009020,0,1636859,0,Evaluation of ultrasonography as a diagnostic technique in the assessment of rotator cuff tendon tears.,"In this study we assessed the clinical usefulness of ultrasonography as a modality in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. One hundred twenty patients with preoperative ultrasonography were analyzed by diagnostic arthroscopy to evaluate rotator cuff integrity. Two groups, 61 patients with a positive ultrasonogram and 59 patients with a negative ultrasonogram, were analyzed. The 61 patients with a positive ultrasonogram preoperatively were found to have 42 full-thickness tears and 19 partial-thickness tears. Diagnostic arthroscopy confirmed a sensitivity of 95% for the full-thickness tears and 41% for the partial-thickness tears. In the 59 patients with negative ultrasonography, the specificity for full-thickness tears was 93% and in the 19 partial-thickness tears it was 91%.

CD009020,0,1613616,0,Painful shoulder syndromes: diagnosis and management.,"Painful shoulder conditions are common primary care problems. Providers should learn the topographical landmarks about the shoulder and understand shoulder mechanics. A careful clinical evaluation will usually provide a likely diagnosis. In unclear cases with marked pain, weakness, and reduced mobility, or with a suspected rotator cuff tear or rupture, arthrography or MRI will usually establish a diagnosis. Therapy of bursitis/tendinitis consists of a steroid injection into the inflamed subacromial area or a 14-day trial of an NSAID. Therapy of bicipital tendinitis, largely empiric because definitive studies are unavailable for any specific treatment, includes judicious peritendinous steroid injections and avoiding aggravating activities. In the management of patients with suspected tendon tears or rupture, primary care practitioners can confirm the diagnosis by ordering MRI or arthrography before referring these patients to an orthopedist for definitive surgical therapy. Optimal management of adhesive capsulitis remains unclear, but an intraarticular steroid injection appears beneficial at least in temporarily diminishing pain. Pendular motion exercising is also an integral part of therapy. Deleterious effects of peribursal or intraarticular steroid infiltration appear minimal; but injections into the tendon or frequent, repetitive injections are contraindicated. Each shoulder condition has a variable course, depending on the structure(s) and extent of involvement."

CD009020,0,1583043,0,The normal glenohumeral relationships. An anatomical study of one hundred and forty shoulders.,"We measured the dimensions of the humeral and glenoid articular surfaces in 140 shoulders that were representative of a given population of patients, and also evaluated several glenohumeral relationships. Ninety-six measurements were made in the shoulders of cadavera and forty-four, on magnetic resonance-imaging studies of living patients. Eighty-five per cent of the humeral measurements fell within eight fixed combinations of the radius of curvature and the thickness of the humeral head, in two-millimeter increments. The average radius of curvature of the humeral head in the coronal plane was 24 +/- 2.1 millimeters (range, nineteen to twenty-eight millimeters). The average thickness of the humeral head was 19 +/- 2.4 millimeters (range, fifteen to twenty-four millimeters). There was a wide variability in the size of the humeral head and a direct correlation between the differences in size and the heights in both men and women. The humeral articular surface was spherical in the center; however, the peripheral radius was two millimeters less in the axial plane than in the coronal plane. Thus, the peripheral contour of the articular surface was elliptical (ratio, 0.92). The radius of curvature of the glenoid, measured in the coronal plane, was an average of 2.3 +/- 0.2 millimeters greater than that of the humeral head. The average dimensions of the glenoid in the superior-inferior and anterior-posterior (lower half) directions were 39 +/- 3.5 millimeters (range, thirty to forty-eight millimeters) and 29 +/- 3.2 millimeters (range, twenty-one to thirty-five millimeters). The anterior-posterior dimension of the glenoid was pear-shaped, the lower half being larger than the top half. The ratio of the lower half to the top half was 1:0.80 +/- 0.01. There was a strong linear correlation between the lateral humeral offset and the size of the humeral head (radius of curvature and thickness). The average lateral humeral offset was 56 +/- 5.7 millimeters (range, forty-three to sixty-seven millimeters). The superior most point on the humeral articular surface was an average of 8 +/- 3.2 millimeters (range, three to twenty millimeters) cephalad to the top of the greater tuberosity. Our data show that reconstruction of the lateral humeral offset is important in optimization of the moment arm of the deltoid and rotator cuff and of the normal tension of the soft tissue after prosthetic reconstruction."

In the past year, a considerable progress has been made in diagnosing these conditions, especially with the aid of magnetic resonance imaging. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions, however, has advanced very little, and we hope that more efforts will be devoted in the future to elucidate how the periarticular soft tissues of the shoulder react to diverse injuries they are exposed to."

Twenty-four patients with clinical suspicion of rotator cuff lesion underwent shoulder arthrography under sonographic control. Patients ranged in age from 26 to 72 years (mean, 57 years). Accuracy of the needle placement using this technique was 100%. There were no injuries to adjacent structures and no extravasation outside the joint. Although fluoroscopic control of needle placement during shoulder arthrography is the technique of choice, sonographic control using the posterior approach may be useful in certain situations (e.g., if the patient is concerned about radiation dose or if there is soft tissue injury at the anterior of the shoulder."
CD009020,0,1553762,0,[Ultrasonography of the rotator cuff of the shoulder].,"Clinical examination for rotator cuff (RC) tear is rarely conclusive. Arthrography has been considered the standard diagnostic procedure for detection of rotator cuff tears. Ultrasonography (US) is less time-consuming and less expensive than arthrography and is, in addition, noninvasive. During recent years, many reports concerning US evaluation of RC tears have been published, but with different results about the diagnostic value of the examination. Recently, some authors have pointed out the ability of US in visualizing degenerative changes in the RC and that it is difficult to differentiate between tears and degenerative changes. By review of the English literature, we conclude that the experienced examiner with proper equipment can confidently differentiate between normal and pathological RC an that in quite a number of cases it is possible to differentiate tears from degenerative changes. In case of doubt, the examination should be supplemented by shoulder arthrography. In the hands of an experienced examiner with proper equipment US seems to be suitable as the initial imaging modality for evaluation of RC."

A fracture of the lesser tuberosity in the x-ray film or a disruption of the subscapularis tendon documented in dynamic sonography of the shoulder clarify the diagnosis. Operative treatment is indicated of prevent weakness of internal rotation as well as anterior instability.

Arthrography or MR imaging with intra-articular Gd-DTPA (MR arthrography) was performed in 95 of the 115. T2-weighted images with the body coil showed high signal intensity lesions in rotator cuffs in only seven of the 10 patients who had tears demonstrated by arthrography or MR arthrography. On the other hand, T2-weighted images with the surface coil demonstrated high signal intensity lesions in cuffs in all 27 patients who were diagnosed to have tears by arthrography or MR arthrography. In 12 patients, T2-weighted images with the surface coil showed high signal intensity lesions in cuffs, while arthrography and MR arthrography did not show tears. Surgery was performed in four of the 12 patients and partial tears were confirmed. A single 10 cm surface coil, 3 mm slice thickness and 2.5 second repetition time seem to account for the fine visualization of cuff tears by the T2-weighted images. These results suggest that T2-weighted images obtained with the surface coil are superior to arthrography and MR arthrography."
CD009020,0,1729796,1,Full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff of the shoulder: diagnosis with MR imaging.,"The purpose of this study was to describe MR findings in full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff. Of 102 shoulders examined by MR imaging, 31 were found to have a full-thickness tendon tear at arthroscopy/bursoscopy (five shoulders) or open surgery (26 shoulders). All shoulders were imaged in oblique coronal and axial planes. MR images of the 102 shoulders were evaluated for (1) the presence of fluid in the subacromial and subdeltoid bursae; (2) abnormal signal of the supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor tendons; (3) interruption of tendon continuity and thinning of the tendon; and (4) proximal retraction of the junction of the muscle and tendon. The presence or absence of each finding was determined by consensus of two radiologists, who interpreted the images without knowledge of the surgical findings. Results in those 31 shoulders with proved full-thickness tears were: fluid in the subacromial bursae (29 shoulders), interruption of tendinous continuity (22 shoulders), focally increased signal of the tendon equivalent to that of water (27 shoulders), and musculotendinous retraction (24 shoulders). The finding of subacromial fluid was a sensitive indicator (93%) of a full-thickness tear, and interruption of tendinous continuity was a specific finding (96%) in diagnosing a full-thickness tear. Our experience shows interruption of tendon continuity is the most specific MR finding of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, while subacromial fluid is the most common finding."

Standard proton-density- and T2-weighted images were normal in 15 of these patients and revealed a partial tear in two patients and a full-thickness tear in two patients. In 13 partial tears found at arthroscopy, MR arthrography showed a partial tear in six patients, no tear in five patients, and a full-thickness tear in two patients; standard MR imaging revealed a partial tear in one patient, no tear in 10 patients, and a full-thickness tear in two patients. All four full-thickness tears proved with arthroscopy were correctly diagnosed with both MR imaging methods. The main advantage of MR arthrography was better depiction of partial tears in the articular surface."
CD009020,0,1304715,0,Rotator cuff disease: current trends in orthopedic management.,"Rotator cuff disease is a clinical entity that is frequently encountered in the typical primary care office. Of particular importance to the chiropractic physician is the close proximity of the shoulder joint to the cervical spine. Due to the relatively high level of morbidity in the population, rotator cuff disease should be looked at carefully on both the physical and advanced diagnostic level. Several factors contributing to rotator cuff pathology include subacromial impingement, the relative microvascular pattern of the cuff mechanism and prior trauma. The natural history of attrition and aging also play a role in rotator cuff disease. Advanced disease is successfully diagnosed through the efficient utilization and proper sequencing of advanced orthopedic imaging studies."
CD009020,0,1729292,0,Shoulder MRI: arthroscopic correlation with emphasis on partial tears.,"In 28 patients the preoperative MR results and arthroscopic examination findings, in which both sides of the rotator cuff were systematically examined, were compared. The interpretive MR criteria were both sensitive and specific for detection of full thickness tears: 100% (5 of 5) and 100% (23 of 23), respectively. Criteria were insensitive in 71% (10 of 14) but specific in 93% (13 of 14) for detection of all tears; 4 of 9 partial thickness tears were not detected of MR. The potential significance of these tears and the use of fat suppression MR sequences to improve detection and depiction of rotator cuff abnormalities are discussed."
CD009020,0,1727282,0,Nondisplaced fractures of the greater tuberosity of the humerus: sonographic detection.,"In this retrospective study, the sonographic appearance of fracture of the greater tuberosity of the humerus was evaluated in 17 men and 14 women aged 20-69 years with acute, semiacute, or remote shoulder trauma in whom results of rotator cuff sonography had suggested the diagnosis of such a fracture. Clinical data, radiologic reports, sonograms, and initial plain radiographs of the shoulder were analyzed; clinical follow-up information was assessed in 22 patients. Sonography showed discontinuity and irregularity of the humeral cortex in all patients. In 25 patients (81%), displaced fracture fragments could be seen. Sonographic findings were suggestive of, but not specific for, fracture. Cortical abnormalities of the humerus were identified without modification of standard scanning protocols. A humeral fracture was confirmed with radiography in 24 patients; in 10 of them, the fracture had been missed initially on plain radiographs. It is concluded that, in evaluation of soft tissues in shoulder trauma, sonography may define rotator cuff abnormalities and occasionally help in detection of occult humeral fractures."
CD009020,0,1550656,0,Arthroscopy of the shoulder joint.,"Arthroscopy is without doubt the most comprehensive procedure for shoulder lesions, providing even better inspection of the interior of the joint than conventional open procedures. In 174 diagnostic arthroscopies, it proved more reliable than the computed tomography scan, ultrasound, or arthrography. The results of ultrasonography proved disappointing despite the enthusiastic reports on this technique, probably due to imperfections of equipment and lack of expertise rather than any inherent defect in the method. Arthrography seems to have a high incidence of false results. Though an invasive method requiring anesthesia, arthroscopy offers many diagnostic advantages such as an assessment of the role of the long biceps tendon and glenohumeral ligaments in recurrent or ordinary dislocation and the recognition of rotator cuff lesions not detectable at arthrography. It is also possible to assess the nature of shoulder instability and so to plan the appropriate operative procedure. A major advantage of arthroscopy is the possibility of carrying out treatment in the same session, though many of the suggested procedures are very demanding in terms of technical skill and time; the complication rate is often excessive. It is therefore best to restrict operative arthroscopy to simpler procedures such as irrigation in joint infections, the trimming of infolded flaps of labrum or stubs of biceps tendon, and the removal of loose bodies, where results are excellent. Arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff or stapling of the labrum are more questionable regarding successes, complications, and recurrence. The equipment for arthroscopic operations needs improvement. Perhaps the major advantage of arthroscopic diagnosis is that it directs open procedures to the essential, thus minimizing operative trauma."

They stress that beside the demonstration of rotator cuff injuries the examination of the surrounding muscles and the labrum glenoidale should not be forgotten either. The modernization of the ultrasound devices, the improvement of the methods of examination and the obtaining of the necessary practice ensure a more and more important place to echography in the diagnosis of traumas of the motion organs."
CD009020,0,1292554,1,Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder joint.,"Because the shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, it is naturally predisposed to several disorders. The most commonly encountered disorders requiring diagnostic imaging are rotator cuff disease and glenohumeral instability. Plain film radiography and arthrography have for many years been the mainstays of shoulder imaging. CT added a third dimension to shoulder imaging, improving its sensitivity with respect to glenoid labral pathology. Ultrasonography of the rotator cuff showed early promise in noninvasive evaluation of cuff tears, but it did not gain universal acceptance because of various negative factors, including inadequate visualization of the cuff, poor results regarding partial tears, and most importantly, operator dependency. The development of MR imaging afforded the radiologist improved comprehensive visualization of the shoulder joint in a noninvasive manner."
CD009020,0,1288377,1,[Contribution of gradient-echo MRI in the study of subacromial pathology: correlation between surgery and arthrography].,"30 asymptomatic volunteer subjects and more than 400 patients with suspected rotator cuff lesions were examined by MRI at 0.5 T using T2*-PD weighted gradient echo (T2-GEI) sequences. Its superiority over T2 spin echo imaging was established in previous studies. The results were compared to those of surgery in 87 cases and arthrography in 233 cases (associated with CT arthrography in 70 cases). In the operated patients, T2-GEI and arthrography correctly diagnosed 49 complete ruptures (CR). T2-GEI was found to be superior to arthrography for defining the real extent of the rupture, the degree of tendon retraction and the local muscular trophicity, essential information to define the therapeutic indications. In contrast, among 22 lesions of the long biceps tendon, correctly demonstrated by arthrography or CT arthrography, 5 intracapsular lesions were not detected by MRI. MRI was able to detect 8 lesions of the anterior labrum associated with a CR not demonstrated by arthrography. Lastly, among the 18 cases of partial inferior rupture (PIR), 6 partial superficial ruptures and 14 cases of inflammatory changes, correctly diagnosed by MRI, only 8 PIR were also demonstrated by arthrography. For the non-operated patients investigated by the two modalities (146 cases), T2-GEI and arthrography were concordant in 43 cases. In contrast, 103 intact cuffs on arthrography showed features on T2-GEI compatible with tendinopathy without rupture, bursitis and degenerative changes. In the absence of very fine surgical or histological correlations for these small lesions, it is impossible, at the present time, to determine the real sensitivity and specificity of MRI."
CD009020,0,1288376,1,[Ultrasonography of the shoulder: diagnosis of rupture of tendons of the rotator muscles].,"After a short historical review of the use of ultrasonography to study shoulder rotator tendons, the technique of the investigation is described, as well as the main landmarks, findings indicative of complete rotator cuff tear, and limitations of ultrasonography in this indication. A number of issues concerning the preoperative workup are discussed. Results in a prospective study of 24 patients are reported. Findings upon ultrasonography, arthrography, and surgical exploration in these patients are analyzed comparatively. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of complete rotator cuff tear (RCT) were 95% and 100%, respectively. These data show that ultrasonography is a reliable investigation for confirming, detecting, and evaluating RCT, although extensive experience with the technique is required."
CD009020,0,1288375,0,[Radiological exploration of the shoulder rotator cuff].,"Plain X-rays and Lecler's manoeuvre constitute the essential basic assessment in the diagnostic approach to lesions of the rotator cuff. The preoperative assessment of the lesions and the search for associated lesions are based on more or less invasive investigations. For many years, arthrography was the reference examination to establish a precise assessment, but was sometimes insufficient for the diagnosis of small partial non-communicating lesions and certain longstanding massive ruptures. Ultrasonography is an attractive non-invasive technique, but the quality of the results depends on the operator's experience. Although computed tomography and CT arthrography provide a perfect analysis of the anterior aspect of the cuff and evaluate the trophicity of the muscles, they are difficult to interpret, irradiating and sometimes incomplete. MRI, a non-invasive and non-irradiating technique, is the modality of choice due to its excellent contrast resolution and the possibility of multidirectional studies and a spatial resolution which is continually improved by new acquisition sequences and the use of better adapted surface coils."

Definition on clinical, neurophysiological and magnetic resonance data.","Compartment syndromes of the scapula and pelvic girdle have received scant attention in the literature. In 1938, Comolli first described a clinical sign which he considered specific to fracture of the scapula. We report data on two patients, one presenting with prolonged pressure on the posterior surface of the scapula and the other with symptoms associated with scapular fracture. In one of these patients we were able to measure pressures around the scapula, perform neurophysiological assessment of nerve function and produce magnetic resonance images of the area. In the other case, surgical exploration revealed an established ischaemic contracture of the infraspinatus muscle within its compartment. These findings suggest that the muscles around the scapula are vulnerable to the development of compartment syndrome."
CD009020,0,1796284,0,[Sources of error in sonographic diagnosis of the rotator cuff].,"Sonography of the shoulder joint has developed into an established examination technique in the diagnosis of periarticular lesions of the shoulder. Sonographic diagnosis of the rotator cuff in particular contains a multitude of possible errors, which are gone into by this study by means of 149 clinically, radiologically and sonographically examined shoulder patients with an average age of 50.5 years. Besides errors made by wrong examination technique such of the transducer as incorrect adjustment of the equipment, insufficient contact of the transducer with the skin and unsuitable choice of the examination plane, there are sources of errors in the interpretation of the sonogram caused by lack of knowledge about physically caused artifacts and sonoanatomical qualities of the shoulder joint. Calcification inside the rotator cuff and the so-called ""sonographic inhomogeneity of the rotator cuff"" are numbered among the sources of error particular to the shoulder joint. Most errors in sonographic diagnosis of the rotator cuff can be avoided by careful examination of both shoulder joints with an exactly tuned ultrasound device, taking into account the sonoanatomical and ultrasonic qualities. Radiological examination of the affected shoulder joint cannot be replaced by ultrasound."
CD009020,0,1788428,0,[The significance of echographic signs in pathology of the rotator cuff].,"Fifty-two patients, 17 acute and 35 chronic, underwent US of the shoulder. The first class of patients had clinical history of blunt trauma occurred 2 to 30 days before examination. The second class of patients included 15 patients with history of trauma occurred 3 months (or more) before examination and 20 patients affected with impingement syndrome. As to the US signs of rotator cuff tear reported in the literature, the results of the study, supported by arthrographic (21 cases), MR (2 cases) and surgical (24 cases) findings, indicate that their presence and significance differ in the acute and in the chronic patient and that: 1) Focal discontinuity, appearing as a hypoechoic area, is demonstrable only in the acute patient. The sign is due to a tear filled with blood and/or bursal liquid and holds high diagnostic accuracy. It is rare that an acute lesion appears as a hyperechoic linear density--which has doubtful diagnostic accuracy. 2) Non-visualization of the cuff is observable in both the acute and the chronic patient and indicates rupture in both of them. This sign has high diagnostic accuracy. 3) Thinning of the cuff is also observable both in the acute and in the chronic patient. Nevertheless, while in the former the sign can be regarded with confidence as indicating a tear in almost all cases, in the latter it may be due either to a tear or to degeneration. Arthrography or MR Imaging are therefore advisable in this group of patients, especially if surgical treatment is considered."
CD009020,0,1939766,0,Double-echo MPGR imaging of the rotator cuff.,"T2-weighted gradient recalled (T2*) sequences are often used in place of T2 sequences when imaging the shoulder. The main advantages of these sequences are the decreased imaging time, the better demonstration of cartilage disorders, and the added tissue information that can be garnered due to the increased sensitivity to magnetic susceptibility with T2* sequences. Unfortunately, one drawback of T2* sequences that is less apparent with spin-echo techniques is the sensitivity of tissue close to the surface coil to undergo diffusely increased signal throughout an area in close proximity to the coil (coil-burnout). This phenomenon is a very bothersome artifact that can obscure tissue differentiation in this area. Fluid detection, especially in the subacromial bursa, can be especially difficult to diagnose in the presence of coil-burnout. We describe MR imaging of the shoulder using double-echo T2-weighted multiplanar gradient recalled sequences, which allow better evaluation of shoulder pathology."

The author claims that by means of ultrasonic examination it is possible to judge the fact and localization of the rotatory cuff, the lesions of the tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle and inflammation of the joint, as well as certain lesions of the soft parts. In addition, it is possible to form by means of ultrasonography an objective judgement of the result of reconstructive joint operations. The values of the information gained by ultrasonic examination is compared to that of arthrography, computertomography and magnetic resonance examination. The author is of the opinion that of all these methods ultrasonic examination should be applied first."

Comparison with observations at surgery in 58 shoulders.,"To investigate the correlation between ultrasonographic and anatomic changes of the rotator cuff of the shoulder, we studied the findings in 58 surgical cases. Fifteen cases had a full thickness tear, 10 of which had a positive and 5 a negative ultrasonogram. Nine cases had partial tears of the cuff on the bursal side. Ultrasonographically, 3 of these were normal. Among the 34 cases that proved to be normal at surgery, 9 had positive ultrasonograms. The predictive value of a negative examination was 0.8, whereas the predictive value of a positive examination was 0.6. A cautious attitude towards ultrasonography for evaluation of the rotator cuff seems appropriate."
CD009020,0,1934094,0,Imaging techniques of the shoulder: present perspectives.,"Through its ability to evaluate the individual components of the rotator cuff, the labral-capsular complex, the subacromial and subdeltoid spaces, and the glenoid, humerus, clavicle, and acromion, MRI provides a means of comprehensively evaluating the shoulder. Further advances in the use of intra-articular MRI contrast agents will undoubtedly enhance the role of MRI in the evaluation of subtle labralcapsular pathology. Although they are experimental, kinematic studies of the shoulder may provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of disorders such as impingement syndrome. The ability of MRI to provide detailed pathologic information about individual components of the shoulder, particularly the rotator cuff, presents a challenge to shoulder surgeons. Patient symptomatology should be correlated with MRI findings and the clinical significance attached to different pathologies reevaluated. Through rigorous confirmation of MRI findings, dedicated therapeutic algorithms can be established based on detailed clinicopathologic data. Present and future surgical and nonsurgical management of the shoulder will undoubtedly be shaped by MRI."

The goal of orthopedists, therapists, trainers, and ancillary personnel who care for athletes involved in sports which require extreme demands of the shoulder is to enhance athletic performance, extend their longevity, and prevent injury. With the new concepts available from basic science and clinical research, a clear understanding of normal architecture and biomechanical function of the shoulder girdle is better appreciated.

Internal rotation produced overlap of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons with soft-tissue interposition or apparent discontinuity of the tendon in 22 cases, including 14 of 15 shoulders positioned in the first 30 degrees between extreme internal and external rotation.

CD009020,0,1767556,0,[Radiologic and sonographic screening study of shoulder joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis].,"In the course of a prospective study at our department the shoulder joints of 50 RA-patients were examined. Two criteria have been applied: only righthanded patients have been examined in order to ascertain any prevalence of changes in the dominant extremity, and only patients who were primarily admitted to our department because of complaints other than those of the shoulder. Examination consisted of anamnesis, clinical tests, radiography and sonography. Reports in the literature concerning involvement of 60%. This percentage was confirmed in our clinical and radiological examinations. If, however, sonography is used, it increases to 96%. Lesions of the rotator cuff can be demonstrated, beginning on the synovial side above bone erosions, without any clinical signs or radiographic changes. Radiographic changes have been rated according to Larsen stages 0-5. Upward migration of the humeral head already before massive bone destruction of the shoulder seems to confirm an early involvement of the rotator cuff. Involvement of the acromioclavicular joint begins with Larsen stage 2 and often includes a distension of the joint cavity. The dominant extremity was not found to be affected predominantly.

In our examination routine, the transducer is guided across the shoulder following the shape of a triangle. Orientation is secured by palpable, bony structures. The clinically relevant parts of the rotator cuff and the long biceps tendon are investigated, first medially and laterally in a transverse projection and then longitudinally. Dynamic examination is provided by moving the transducer as well as the shoulder joint. In a time-saving examination routine, all important soft tissue structures of the shoulder are visualized."
CD009020,0,1745539,0,[Examination of the non-injured shoulder].,"Modern imaging methods are undeniably very attractive. They should make possible an easy study of the musculotendinous rotator cuff of the shoulder joint, lesions of which are the cause of most painful or stiff shoulder syndromes. However, not all shoulder symptoms are due to rotator cuff lesions. Also, not all methods of imaging are equally suited to showing the different cuff lesions. Further, one cannot consider the treatment of a symptomatic shoulder without having an assessment of the present condition upon which to gauge the functional improvement due to the treatment. Hence clinical examination of the painful shoulder remains essential. This makes it possible (1) to exclude an extra-articular pathology, (2) to choose the method of imaging most suited to showing the suspected lesion, and finally (3) to quantify the functional state of the shoulder."
CD009020,0,1910827,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of shoulder impingement.,"MRI is an accurate technique for diagnostic evaluation of a broad spectrum of shoulder pathology. In particular, rotator cuff injuries are a frequent cause of pain and disability. The mechanism of injury to the supraspinatus tendon usually begins with microscopic tears of fibers of the triple helix collagen molecule. This leads to increased motion of the bound water within the collagen molecule that lengthens the effective T2 of the tendon, allowing short TE imaging sequences to detect signal in abnormal tendons. Clinically significant disease probably does not occur without frank collagen rupture, and the associated collection of free water within the severely diseased tendon presents as high signal on long TE images. Thus, the clinical significance of tendon disease is best evaluated on long TR, long TE image acquisitions. Any process that accelerates microscopic tear formation or delays repair can increase a patient's risk of supraspinatus tendon tears. Impingement is the most important process accelerating microscopic tear formation. MRI's multiplanar, tomographic imaging ability markedly improves the ability to sensitively and specifically detect bony impingement. Hopefully, this will allow earlier arthroscopic decompression and improved patient prognosis with impingement."
CD009020,0,2068322,0,Medial dislocation of the biceps brachii tendon: appearance at MR imaging.,"Abnormalities of the long tendon of the biceps brachii muscle commonly accompany other lesions about the shoulder, especially rotator cuff rupture, and are a frequent cause of a painful shoulder. The spectrum of abnormalities associated with medial displacement of the biceps tendon seen at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was reviewed in six patients. MR imaging was performed on a 1.5-T system with use of a dedicated surface coil. The findings at MR imaging were correlated with those at surgery. Two types of medial displacement of the biceps tendon were identified. More frequently observed was a defect in the subscapularis apparatus that allowed intraarticular entrapment of the biceps tendon. Less commonly observed was incomplete dislocation, with the biceps tendon lying between a partially disrupted subscapularis tendon. MR imaging enabled accurate identification of medial dislocation of the biceps tendon and entrapment of the tendon within the glenohumeral joint. MR imaging also demonstrated the associated disruption of the subscapularis tendon that must be present to allow the biceps tendon access to the joint space."

Correlation of functional results with integrity of the cuff.,"We evaluated the results of 105 operative repairs of tears of the rotator cuff of the shoulder in eighty-nine patients at an average of five years postoperatively. We correlated the functional result with the integrity of the cuff, as determined by ultrasonography. Eighty per cent of the repairs of a tear involving only the supraspinatus tendon were intact at the time of the most recent follow-up, while more than 50 per cent of the repairs of a tear involving more than the supraspinatus tendon had a recurrent defect. Older patients and patients in whom a larger tear had been repaired had a greater prevalence of recurrent defects. At the time of the most recent follow-up, most of the patients were more comfortable and were satisfied with the result of the repair, even when they had sonographic evidence of a recurrent defect. The shoulders in which the repaired cuff was intact at the time of follow-up had better function during activities of daily living and a better range of active flexion (129 +/- 20 degrees compared with 71 +/- 41 degrees) compared with the shoulders that had a large recurrent defect. Similar correlations were noted for the range of active external and internal rotation and for strength of flexion, abduction, and internal rotation. In the shoulders in which the cuff was not intact, the degree of functional loss was related to the size of the recurrent defect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The results of the imaging studies were then compared with the operative findings. Magnetic resonance imaging was found to be the most useful modality for establishment of the etiology of pain in the shoulder due to disease of the rotator cuff, instability associated with abnormality of the glenoid labrum, subacromial impingement, stenosis of the coracoacromial arch, and osteoarthrosis of either the glenohumeral or the acromioclavicular joint. The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging was found to depend on both the operator and the technique and was decreased in extremely obese patients, due to difficulties in positioning, and in patients who had had a previous operation. Magnetic resonance imaging was more accurate than either computerized tomographic arthrography or ultrasonography in identifying partial-thickness tears (intrasubstance changes in the rotator cuff). Magnetic resonance imaging provided the same level of accuracy as computerized tomographic arthrography in the detection of abnormalities of the glenoid labrum."

Both tests were done preoperatively, and the condition of the rotator cuff was determined intraoperatively. Arthrography was accurate in the diagnosis of twenty-eight (87 per cent) of the thirty-two patients (twenty who had a full-thickness tear, seven who had a partial-thickness tear, and five who had an untorn rotator cuff and tendinitis), while ultrasonography was diagnostic in only twelve (37 per cent).

The dislocated tendon can be identified medial to the bicipital groove, best seen on the axial and oblique coronal and sagittal images. Associated abnormalities of the biceps tendon include thickening (n = 3), high signal intensity (n = 3), and surrounding fluid (n = 4). The factors thought to contribute to dislocation can also be well seen on MR images. These include abnormal shape of the bicipital groove (n = 2), disruption of the coracohumeral ligament (n = 6), disruption (n = 4) and thinning (n = 1) of the subscapularis tendon, and supraspinatus tendon tear (n = 4).

Seven small rotator cuff tears measuring 0.5-1 cm were identified on MR images, with arthrographic and surgical confirmation of these findings in two patients and surgical confirmation only in three patients. Cortical irregularity and/or subchondral cyst formation at the posterior aspect of the greater tuberosity near the insertion site of the infraspinatus tendon was found in five of the seven players with rotator cuff tears. Similar findings were noted in the asymptomatic volunteer and in one of the three players without cuff tear, who also had irregular thickening of the posterior capsule. These findings are believed to represent chronic avulsive changes resulting from the deceleration stresses of the follow-through motion."

Sonography demonstrated 14 of 15, MRI 10 of 15 rotator cuff tears, respectively. Sonography diagnosed seven of nine intact rotator cuffs correctly, MRI eight of nine. In a retrospective study we reviewed the diagnostic value of sonography and MRI in other pathologies of the shoulder including intra-articular pathology, humeral head and acromioclavicular joint pathology, and calcification. We conclude that with regard to cost and patient compliance, sonography should be the first radiologic examination in suspected rotator cuff tears if performed by an experienced sonographer. MRI is superior in depicting additional pathology and is less operator dependent. It may thus become the method of choice for the evaluation of the rotator cuff and related pathology in the future."

The injury was caused either by forceful hyperextension or external rotation of the adducted arm. The patients complained of anterior shoulder pain and weakness of the arm when it was used above and below the shoulder level. They did not experience shoulder instability. The injured shoulders exhibited increased external rotation and decreased strength of internal rotation. A simple clinical manoeuvre called the 'lift-off test', reliably diagnosed or excluded clinically relevant rupture of the subscapularis tendon. Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis was best achieved by ultrasonography or MRI, but arthrography or CT arthrography were also useful. Surgical exploration confirmed the diagnosis in every case.

Seventy percent had a good or excellent clinical result, and 14 percent were graded as poor. Upon ultrasonographic examination of the 97 shoulders, 37 had a normal rotator cuff, 31 had thinning and/or hyperdensity, and 29 had a complete rupture of the cuff. Patients with concomitant anterior acromioplasties did better than those without. There was a poor correlation between clinical and ultrasonographic results. We recommend that rotator cuff tears should be closed only if this can be achieved without undue tension. If extensive tissue mobilization or coverage with alloplastic material or with regional muscle flaps is required, the lesion should be debrided and left open, and only an anterior acromioplasty should be performed."
CD009020,0,2009680,0,Advances in imaging of rheumatoid arthritis.,"Several new imaging modalities have been found useful in clinical evaluation of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has proven to be an excellent noninvasive method to evaluate the spine, shoulder, hip, and knees; its use for the evaluation of smaller joints is still being investigated. In patients with RA, MR imaging has been used to evaluate cervical spine instability, rotator cuff tear, osteonecrosis, and osteomyelitis. Patients with RA may have advanced osteoporosis, predisposing to insufficiency fractures. This includes fractures associated with increased activity after hip or knee arthroplasty. Newer methods for measuring the degree of osteoporosis include single photon absorptiometry, dual photon absorptiometry, quantitative computed tomography (CT), and dual-energy projection radiography. It has not yet been determined which of these methods will be most widely used in the future, but quantitative CT and dual-energy projection radiography currently show the most promise. Ultrasonography provides an excellent noninvasive method for the diagnosis of popliteal cysts, and color Doppler sonography can differentiate cyst and popliteal aneurysm. As compared to radiography or conventional CT, high-resolution CT provides an improved method to detect the early changes of RA in the lung parenchyma."
CD009020,0,2057868,0,[Nuclear magnetic resonance tomography of changes in the supraspinatus tendon in impingement syndrome of the athlete].,In 13 athletes with impingement-syndrome we evaluated the shoulder joints by MRI. We found significant changes at the bone-tendon junction of the supraspinatus tendon at the major tubercle. There were no intratendinous ruptures. The site of the pathologic changes at the insertion of the supraspinatus tendon may be caused by a tendinosis. Other reasons for the impingement-syndrome are discussed. According to our results an insertional tendinosis may be the reason for impingement-syndromes in athletes.
CD009020,0,1847536,0,[The place of magnetic resonance tomography in the diagnosis of diseases of the shoulder joint].,"In a prospective study 43 patients with shoulder pain were examined by sonography and MRI. The findings were controlled by plain radiography, arthrography, and CT arthrography. Joint effusions and humeral head defects were equally identified by MR and sonography. In the diagnosis of labrum lesions, rotator cuff lesions, subacromial spurs, and synovial inflammatory disease sonography was not as accurate as MR. A special MR scoring system improved the diagnosis of an impingement syndrome."
CD009020,0,2011836,0,[Diagnosis of arthritis with the aid of imaging methods].,"Among imaging techniques plain radiographs still play an outstanding role in the assessment of osteoarthrosis. Main diagnostic features comprise joint space narrowing (often segmental in the initial phase), subchondral sclerosis and cyst formation (both predominantly in the stressed area of the joint), and osteophytes at areas of low stress, often at joint margins. Anatomy and stress characteristics of the joint involved decide upon pattern and extent of the degenerative changes. The most common sites of osteoarthrosis include the interphalangeal joints, often in combination with the first carpometacarpal and trapezio-scaphoid joints, hip, knee, and first metatarsophalangeal joint of the foot. For assessment of these easily accessible joints, conventional radiographic techniques usually provide sufficient information. In special situations where differential diagnostics are important, methods such as computerized tomography or scintigraphy may prove very helpful. In the hands of experienced users ultrasonography is able to depict accompanying soft tissue changes such as rotator cuff ruptures or cysts. Magnetic resonance imaging represents a promising tool for detection of very early osteoarthrosis; small areas of cartilage damage can be assessed adequately. Although this method will certainly give new insight into aspects of early degenerative disease, its use is still confined to research-oriented applications with respect to osteoarthrosis."

Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value.","The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of lesions of the rotator cuff, glenohumeral capsule, and glenoid labrum were evaluated in ninety-one patients and fifteen asymptomatic volunteers. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated 100 per cent sensitivity and 95 per cent specificity in the diagnosis of complete tears, and it consistently predicted the size of the tear of the rotator cuff. There was a definite correlation between atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle and the size of a complete, chronic tear of the rotator cuff. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging in the differentiation of tendinitis from degeneration of the cuff were 82 and 85 per cent, and in the differentiation of a normal tendon from one affected by tendinitis with signs of impingement the sensitivity and specificity were 93 and 87 per cent. The formation of spurs around the acromion and acromiocalvicular joint correlated highly with increased age of the patient and with chronic disease of the rotator cuff. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of labral tears associated with glenohumeral instability were 88 and 93 per cent. The study showed that high-resolution magnetic-resonance imaging is an excellent non-invasive tool in the diagnosis of lesions of the rotator cuff and glenohumeral instability."

Surgical and arthrographic correlations].,"Fifteen asymptomatic volunteers and 300 patients with suspected lesions of the rotator cuff were examined with T2*- and proton density-weighted gradient echo (T2*-Rho-GEI) MRI sequences (500-700 ms/30 ms/30 degrees) with a 0.5 T (GE-CGR) system and an adapted surface coil. For the patients, the findings were compared with those of arthrography in 130 cases and of surgery in 42 cases. For the operated patients, T2*-Rho-GEI and arthrography allowed correctly diagnosing 31 complete ruptures (CR). However, surgical exploration of the ruptures showed that T2*-Rho-GEI showed the actual extent of the rupture and the degree of tendon retraction better than arthrography. T2*-Rho-GEI also provides information about the thickness and trophicity of the remaining cuff and on local muscle trophicity. T2*-Rho-GEI allows directly evaluating the tendon of the long head of the biceps both in its extra-articular and its intra-articular parts. In 3 cases of complete cuff rupture, MRI allowed detecting 3 associated lesions of the anterior labrum, which had not been suspected on the clinical examination and had not been demonstrated by conventional arthrography. Lastly, out of 12 cases of deep incomplete rupture (n = 12) correctly diagnosed with MRI, 5 had been undetected on arthrography. Similarly, 8 cases of inflammatory alterations suspected with T2*-Rho-GEI and confirmed by surgery had not been recognized with arthrography. For the non-operated patients, T2*-Rho-GEI and arthrography had corresponding results for the diagnosis of CR (8 cases), of DIR (6 cases) and of intact cuff (6 cases).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009020,0,1812516,1,[Contribution of MRI to the preoperative evaluation of rotator cuff tears].,The authors report a series of 38 patients who had been examined by MRI and then operated for a rotator cuff syndrome. The correlation between the description of the cuff lesions after MRI and the surgical observations were excellent for 37 patients. In one case MRI showed a false image of tear of the supra spinatus m. on its anterior edge. This was due to a bad knowledge of the anatomy of the muscle and tendon and to a poor orientation of the frontal cut plane. This study was completed with MRI and anatomic study of 12 non embalmed cadaveric shoulders. The results showed that MRI was very sensitive (0.93) and specific (0.94) for the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. MRI allowed also to show partial tears of the tendons of the rotator cuff. The authors propose a MRI classification of cuff lesions which permits to establish a good surgical planning.
CD009020,0,2243995,1,Rotator cuff lesions: signal patterns at MR imaging.,"The signal intensity patterns of rotator cuff lesions at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were evaluated in 80 patients who had surgical correlation and in 13 asymptomatic individuals (14 shoulders). Six cadaver shoulders were examined with MR, and histologic correlation was obtained in four. All studies were performed at 1.5 T with a flexible circular surface coil. The accuracy of MR imaging in detection of full-thickness cuff tears (31 patients) was 0.95 and of partial thickness tears (16 patients), 0.84. The most common and accurate pattern for full-thickness cuff tears (22 of 31 tears) was a region of intense signal seen on T2-weighted images. Less often the torn region consisted of an extremely degenerated and attenuated tendon with moderate signal intensity or was obscured by low-signal-intensity scar. The intense signal pattern on T2-weighted images was also accurate, although a less common finding (seven of 16 cases), in the diagnosis of partial tears. Tendinitis was recognized as focal or diffuse regions of increased signal intensity or a nonhomogeneous pattern of increased signal often associated with tendinous enlargement. In some patients, manifestations of subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis was present. Tendon degeneration was also manifested as regions of increased signal intensity. Some similarity and overlap of signal patterns of partial interstitial tears, tendinitis, and tendon degeneration are observed."

CD009020,0,2267376,0,[Comparative arthrographic and echographic study of degenerative lesions of the rotator cuff of the shoulder].,"Sonography is a simple technique which is currently employed in the study of rotator cuff lesions in the shoulder. A comparative US and arthrographic study was carried out on 52 patients with a ""painful shoulder"", to evaluate US yield in this pathologic condition. Arthrography was positive for a rotator cuff lesion in 31/52 cases (25 full-thickness and 6 incomplete lesions) and demonstrated associated conditions (capsulitis, chondral lesions, lesions of the long head of biceps, capsulo-ligamentous hypotonia, effusions) in 11 case. Arthrographic findings were negative in 10 cases. US demonstrated a lesion in 25/31 of positive arthrographic cases, and it was negative in 3/6 incomplete lesions. In 7/11 patients US yielded additional information as to associated conditions. US false-positives were 3/10, while in the extant 7/10 cases US was negative too. Thanks to its high sensitivity and specificity (80% and 70%, respectively, in our series), US appears as a valuable diagnostic complement to arthrography; the former may even replace the latter in those cases where conservative treatment is expected."
CD009020,0,2229570,0,MR evaluation of chest wall involvement in malignant lymphoma.,"Chest CT and magnetic resonance (MR) examinations of 28 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent lymphoma involving the mediastinum were retrospectively evaluated for evidence of chest wall involvement. Computed tomography demonstrated seven sites of chest wall involvement in four patients; whereas MR demonstrated 14 sites in seven patients, including all sites shown by CT. Eight chest wall lesions were located in the extranodal soft tissues (three sites were contiguous with anterior mediastinal lymphadenopathy; three sites were contiguous with pleural/parenchymal disease; and one each involved the breast and multiple vertebral bodies). Six sites involved lymph nodes in the interpectoral (n = 4), submammary (n = 1), and infraspinatus (n = 1) areas. Lesion conspicuity in the chest wall was better on T2- than T1-weighted sequences and was best on short inversion time inversion recovery. Detection of chest wall lymphoma may alter staging; when present in this group of patients, it influenced management in two of the seven patients."
CD009020,0,2119117,1,MR arthrography of the shoulder: comparison with conventional MR imaging.,"Twenty-three patients underwent both conventional MR imaging of the shoulder and MR shoulder arthrography for clinically suspected labral or rotator cuff abnormalities. Images obtained before and after contrast administration were studied independently, and without knowledge of clinical findings, by two radiologists for the presence of abnormalities of the glenoid labrum or rotator cuff. Results were correlated with surgical findings in all patients. Nine patients had surgically proved labral tears. MR arthrography detected all nine labral abnormalities, while six of the nine were missed on conventional MR imaging. Fourteen patients had surgically proved rotator cuff tears. MR arthrography detected 11 of the 14 tears and missed three partial tears on the bursal surface. Conventional MR imaging detected nine cuff tears and missed five tears; two of these were complete rotator cuff tears and three were partial tears of the undersurface of the rotator cuff. Our results suggest that MR arthrography enhances the accuracy of MR in the evaluation of the glenoid labrum and rotator cuff tendon."

CD009020,0,2203144,0,[Value of diagnostic measures in soft tissue diseases and soft tissue lesions of the shoulder joint].,"Calcifying tendinitis, acute tendinitis, frozen shoulder, rotator cuff rupture, subluxation of the gleno-humeral joint and injury of the biceps tendon are commonly classed under the blanket term ""peri-arthropathy of the shoulder"". It is now possible to make a precise diagnosis of these shoulder disorders by means of a clinical examination supported by X-ray examination, ultrasonography, arthrography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and arthroscopy. Calcifying tendinitis is diagnosed by consideration of the patient's history, followed by clinical examination and X-ray examination. Acute tendinitis is a clinical diagnosis, as is frozen shoulder. Ruptures of the rotator cuff can be detected by ultrasonography, which is a screening method; such ruptures can also be detected by arthrography. The localization and extent of the defect are best estimated by arthroscopy. Shoulder instability is another clinical diagnosis. Bony defects of the humeral head (Hill-Sachs lesion) or the glenoid rim are revealed by computed tomography (CT). CT arthrography reveals the presence of any Broca-Hartman lesion in the anterior inferior part of the anterior capsular mechanism. Rupture, subluxation or luxation of the biceps tendon are diagnosed either by clinical examination or by arthroscopy. Knowledge of the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the diagnostic procedures makes it possible to carry them out in a standardized, logical sequence. Arthroscopy allows a decidedly more accurate diagnosis than any of the other methods, but as it is an invasive procedure it should be kept until last when diagnosis of disorders of the gleno-humeral joint is required."
CD009020,0,2367103,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder.,"The shoulder is now accessible to MRI owing to recent technical advances. The major advantages of this modality include its noninvasive nature, lack of ionizing radiation, excellent contrast and anatomic resolution, multiplanar imaging capability, and ability as a single imaging modality to evaluate simultaneously for a wide variety of pathologic processes. It is proving its utility particularly in the evaluation of the painful shoulder and the diagnosis of glenohumeral instability, rotator cuff impingement, tendinitis, and tear. We believe that with greater experience and large comparative studies, MRI will clearly demonstrate its superiority in evaluation of the shoulder and will almost entirely replace arthrography, as has occurred with the knee."
CD009020,0,2200127,0,[Clinical management of lesions of the rotator cuff].,"Lesions of the rotator cuff are caused in most cases by degenerative changes in the critical area around the tuberosities of the humerus. Clinical examination reveals atrophy of the supra- and infraspinatus muscles, a painful arc of movement and, especially, pain at night. There are many clinical tests that can be helpful in the diagnosis. Both ultrasonography and arthrography have proved to be very sensitive methods for the detection of rotator cuff tears. Ultrasonography allows determination of the size and location in addition. Conservative treatment includes rest, physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medication. In many cases the symptoms are improved by many weeks of conservative treatment alone. Operative treatment becomes necessary when no pain relief and no satisfactory movement can be achieved. Complete correction of the tendon defect is important for postoperative care. Passive exercise must allow the tendon repair to remain intact without subjecting it to undue stress."
CD009020,0,2195474,0,The use of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears.,"One hundred consecutive patients with symptoms of chronic subacromial impingement syndrome were evaluated by both arthrography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. By comparing intermediate and T2 weighted images, the ability to identify the normal and abnormal anatomy of the rotator cuff with the MRI was excellent. All 51 patients with arthrogram-proven rotator cuff tears had abnormal MRI scans (100% sensitivity). However, six of the 49 patients with normal arthrograms had abnormal MRI scans (88% specificity). At arthroscopy, four of these patients were found to have moderate to severe partial thickness rotator cuff tears. These findings indicate that in patients with longstanding subacromial impingement syndrome the MRI has an exceptionally high sensitivity for damage to the rotator cuff."

CD009020,0,2341451,0,Haemophilic arthropathy of the shoulder.,"Among 41 adult haemophiliacs 15 suffered from shoulder symptoms. We examined 12 patients by radiography and ultrasound. Four had bilateral symptoms making a total of 16 symptomatic shoulders. Of these, 10 had abnormal ultrasound scans with eight having evidence of rotator cuff tears. Evidence of bicipital tendonitis was found in two. Pain with loss of range of movement and a positive impingement sign was the most reliable clinical indicator of a cuff tear. Joint incongruity and superior migration of the humeral head were the best radiographic indicators. Rotator cuff tears are a common component of haemophilic arthropathy of the shoulder."
CD009020,0,2182260,0,Diagnosis and treatment of incomplete rotator cuff tears.,"The histopathologic changes leading to rotator cuff rupture are gradual and progressive. Incomplete tears can be observed in the articular or bursal surface. These partial lesions are infrequently demonstrated with arthrography or bursography. Although structural variations in cuff integrity can be demonstrated with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, precise definition of partial tears is difficult. The exact location and extent of incomplete tears can be documented with shoulder arthroscopy. Anterior acromioplasty, either open or arthroscopic, is indicated for the treatment of chronic mechanical impingement refractory to conservative management. When a sizable partial defect is identified at open surgery, the degenerated tissue is excised and the tendon is reattached to bone or repaired with side-to-side suture. Arthroscopic treatment consists of debridement of the torn cuff margins, followed by arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD). When the incomplete tear in an active individual involves more than one-half the cuff thickness, arthroscopic and open techniques can be combined. Twenty partial-thickness tears were encountered among 130 patients who had ASD for chronic impingement. Fifteen had a satisfactory result, but five required additional surgery. A system of grading partial-thickness tears based on location, depth, and area is presented in an effort to standardize the observations of various investigators and to permit comparison of the results of arthroscopic treatment."
CD009020,0,2160695,0,[Magnetic resonance tomography of the shoulder. Possibilities of over interpretation of normal findings].,"In order to test the criteria for abnormalities of the shoulder as seen on MR, 30 normal shoulders were examined. The examination included T1, proton and T2-weighted SE sequences and T2*-weighted FE sequences, using transverse, oblique coronary and oblique sagittal planes. In 57% there was increased signal intensity in the tendon of the rotator cuff; this might have been interpreted as a rupture of the cuff or tendinitis. Anatomical examination suggests that the finding is due to a normal layer between the long head of the biceps and the tendon joint complex. The anterior glenoid labrum could not be clearly delineated in 57% and the posterior labrum in 5%. In two cases there was a superior, postero-lateral defect in the head of the humerus. The currently accepted criteria for the MRT diagnosis of shoulder abnormalities need to be critically re-evaluated."
CD009020,0,2188343,0,[Imaging of the shoulder in orthopedic pathology].,"Radiological examination of an unstable shoulder relies on straight X-ray images which are better than CT scans to detect bone lesions consecutive to anterior destabilizing accidents. The indications of CT arthrography are very limited. Radiological studies of the rotator cuff must necessarily include a standard radiological examination. Contrast arthrography is used either to find out whether or not the cuff is damaged, or when the tear is thought to be small. Arthropneumotomography is useful in the preoperative assessment of severe postero-superior tears. CT arthrography is very good to explore the subscapular muscle and to detect medial dislocation of the biceps long head tendon. The first results of MRI are encouraging, and when the cost of this method is reduced it might replace arthrography."
CD009020,0,2188339,0,[Rupture of the rotator cuff].,"Spontaneous or traumatic ruptures almost always occur in a cuff that has degenerated due to overuse. Despite the lack of absolute anatomico-clinical correlation, two clinical types can be described: a conflictual, often hyperalgesic shoulder with its painful arch corresponding to a small anterosuperior rupture, or a pseudo-paralytic shoulder betraying a major posterosuperior rupture. Standard radiography with Leclercq's manoeuvre is performed primarily to find out whether the cuff is continent or incontinent. Modern medical imaging (ultrasonography or MRI) adds precision to the lesions when surgery is contemplated. When medical treatment has failed, partial ruptures are treated by arthrolysis; ruptures of the superficial and deep layers of the cuff without calcification benefit from endoscopy; ruptures involving tendons or associated with calcifications are treated by surgery. Small and medium ruptures with a continent cuff require endoscopic or surgical anterior decompression combined, in cases where the intra-articular long head of the biceps is exposed, with repair, usually by suture. Extensive ruptures with an incontinent cuff are treated by muscle transfer alone of combined with arthroplasty, or by semi-constrained total prosthesis when arthrosis of the humeral joint is present."
CD009020,0,2180600,0,A comparative study of ultrasonography and arthrography in evaluation of the rotator cuff.,"Fifty patients with signs and symptoms of chronic impingement syndrome and/or rotator cuff tear were evaluated with shoulder arthrograms and ultrasonography. Ninety asymptomatic shoulders of a comparable age had ultrasonography to serve as a control group. All controls had normal ultrasonograms with no hypoechoic or sonolucent areas. The 50 symptomatic shoulder patients had the following: 28 had a normal arthrogram with either normal ultrasonograms or buckling of the supraspinatus tendon; eight had normal arthrograms, but ultrasonography indicated a thin (less than 4 mm) irregular supraspinatus tendon; 11 had complete rotator cuff tears visualized on both arthrography and ultrasonography (nine of these 11 patients had surgery confirming complete tears in all); two had a false-positive sonogram, and one had a false-negative sonogram. Thus, the ultrasonography's overall positive predictive value to detect a full-thickness rotator cuff tear was 85%, its negative predictive value was 97%, its sensitivity was 92%, and its specificity was 95%. Real-time ultrasonography is a diagnostically sensitive and specific noninvasive method to evaluate patients with shoulder impingement syndrome, leading to the recommendation that it be used as a primary imaging technique to obviate or supplement arthrography in evaluating rotator cuff disease. However, static ultrasonographic pictures, without real-time ultrasonography as a supplement, were not helpful."

The best indications for performing an arthroscanner are the intraarticular lesions such as injuries of the glenoid labrum and of the articular capsule. Echography is the most performing technique for bicipital and rotator cuff tendinitis. CT scan helps to understand the antero-internal retro-coracoidal impingment syndromes as well as uninterpretable bone lesions at standard radiography.

CD009020,0,2321039,0,Magnetic resonance imaging in acute and chronic rotator cuff tears.,"Magnetic resonance imaging has been assessed in patients with acute rotator cuff tears and normal radiographs (9 cases) and those with chronic tears and changes of cuff arthropathy (9 cases). All images were obtained using a low field strength system (FONAR 0.3 T). Particular attention was placed on the appearances of the tendon and the cuff muscles themselves. Six complete acute tears were clearly identified, but MRI failed to demonstrate two partial tears. Muscle bulk was preserved in all patients in this group. In contrast, all patients with cuff arthropathy had complete tears of the supraspinatus tendon with marked tendon retraction and associated muscle atrophy: these changes precluded primary surgical repair. MRI should be used to assess muscle atrophy preoperatively in those patients with acute tears. When plain radiographs demonstrate cuff arthropathy, the MRI appearances are predictable and primary repair is unlikely to be successful. Further imaging is therefore not indicated."

The sonographic technique used was based on a review of the literature and experience gained by scanning normal subjects. The sonographic criteria for the diagnosis of a complete rotator cuff tear were a focal defect in the cuff or complete absence or nonvisualization of the cuff. All sonograms were interpreted prospectively without knowledge of arthrographic or surgical results. With arthrography as the standard of comparison for the diagnosis of rotator cuff tear, sonographic results included 15 true-positives, 52 true-negatives, eight false-negatives, and four false-positives. With surgery as the standard of comparison, the results were one true-positive and one true-negative sonogram.

A surface coil is presented with a particular configuration of easy clinical use and with such technical features as to allow reduced fields to be imaged, with good spatial resolution. MR imaging could demonstrate with equal accuracy both skeletal-cartilage components and capsulo-ligamentous structures, thus defining associated lesions and small tears. In both degenerative and traumatic lesions of the rotator cuff, MR imaging showed both extent and entity of the pathologic process, with high accuracy in defining the impingement syndrome. MR imaging allowed the depiction of the anterior and posterior glenoid labra, even without intraarticular contrast media. Moreover, MR imaging made it possible to recognize both fractures and degenerative processes within the glenoid labrum on the basis of their signal intensities. This preliminary experience allows the authors to conclude that MR imaging is an accurate and non-invasive diagnostic method for the study of traumatic lesions and of degenerative changes of the shoulder."
CD009020,0,2685890,0,[The importance of imaging technics in the diagnosis of sports related periarticular shoulder lesions].,"Numerous kinds of sports lead to lesions of the periarticular tissue of the shoulder, which can result in the supraspinatus syndrome or incomplete and complete rupture of the rotator cuff. Standard radiography is of limited use in the diagnosis of periarticular diseases of the shoulder. Osseous alterations in the greater tubercle and undersurface of the acromion can be explained as a supraspinatus syndrome or a long-standing rupture of the rotator cuff in connection with high positioning of the head of the humerus. A rupture of the rotator cuff is demonstrated by arthrography of the shoulder joint, a diagnostic method that we think is necessary despite regular examinations with ultrasonography."
CD009020,0,2678248,1,Rotator cuff sonography: a reassessment.,"This study is both a retrospective and prospective evaluation of the clinical usefulness of shoulder sonography. Ninety-eight patients suspected of having rotator cuff tears underwent sonography of both shoulders. Sixty-two patients underwent double-contrast arthrography performed on the same day as sonography, and 38 patients underwent surgery after sonography. A comparison of the results from ultrasound and arthrography, using published diagnostic criteria, demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 43% for detection of a rotator cuff tear. In this study, use of more restricted criteria, a subset of the published criteria, yielded a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 90%. A comparison of sonography with surgery, using this study's criteria, demonstrated a sensitivity of 57% and a specificity of 76%. This report shows that shoulder sonography is less reliable than previously reported and appears to have a very limited role in the evaluation of rotator cuff injuries."
CD009020,0,2678247,1,Rotator cuff tear: clinical experience with sonographic detection.,"Between June 1986 and April 1988, 86 sonographic examinations of the shoulder were performed on patients suspected of having rotator cuff tears. Major sonographic diagnostic criteria included (a) a well-defined discontinuity usually visible as a hypoechoic focus within the cuff, (b) nonvisualization of the cuff and (c) an echogenic focus within the cuff. Seventy-five patients underwent both sonography and arthrography. Compared with arthrography alone, ultrasound examinations enabled detection of 92% of rotator cuff tears (24 of 26 tears), with a specificity of 84% and a negative predictive value of 95%. Correlation was obtained in 30 of these patients who underwent surgery for rotator cuff tear or other soft-tissue abnormality. In this group, the sensitivity of sonography for detection of a tear was 93%, with a specificity of 73%, while for arthrography sensitivity was 87% and specificity was 100%. These data indicate that sonography is a useful, noninvasive screening procedure for patients suspected of having rotator cuff injury."

CD009020,0,2678284,0,[Rotator cuff lesions: evaluation with RM and US].,"Physical and instrumental examination of the patients with an ""aching shoulder"" is often difficult and a positive out-come of surgical treatment may be impaired by the late diagnosis of long-standing rotator cuff lesions causing tendon adhesions and muscle atrophy. The authors report the results obtained in 25 selected patients with an aching shoulder examined with arthrography, real-time ultrasound (US) with a 5 MHz linear probe, and high-field (1.5 T) Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging. Arthrography was able to demonstrate a cuff tear in 14/25 cases; US detected signs of tear in 14/25 (1 false negative); MR imaging showed a cuff lesion in 16/25 patients, and in one case allowed a partial cuff tear to be demonstrated, which had not been visualized with arthrography. MR imaging could also demonstrate other signs of periarticular pathologies (tendinitis, longhead of biceps inflammation, and bursitis) that may represent the early stages of the inflammatory-degenerative process underlying most of cuff lesions. The high diagnostic accuracy of US (95%) is stressed in the detection of cuff tears, in patients with an aching shoulder; as for questionable cases at US, MR imaging is indicated as a valid alternative to arthrography, which is more invasive and less accepted by the patients."

On reviewing 354 sonographies of the shoulder (7.5 MHz), it was found that 61 (= 17%) abnormal findings of the LHB were reported such as degenerative changes accompanying impingement stadium II and III (atrophy, hypertrophy, effusion), intracapsular ruptures, acute isolated tenosynovitis and bony changes of the sulcus (bony spurs, shallow and dysplastic sulcus with subluxation of the LHB). Each abnormal finding was confirmed by x-ray and arthrography (some via CT) and compared with sonographic report. There seems to be a strikingly high percentage of rotator cuff tears connected with lesions of the LHB and the reduced filling of the sheath of the LHB, if combined lesions were apparent elsewhere in the shoulder. We consider sonography to be the method of choice in the assessment of LHB injuries; in case of verified lesion of the LHB, other pathologic conditions elsewhere in the shoulder are likely."
CD009020,0,2678466,0,[Possibilities of sonography in the diagnosis of instabilities of the shoulder joint].,"We present ultrasound investigation as a diagnostic tool for shoulder instability. The following structures are visible in the posterior transversal plane: subcutis, deltoid muscle, infraspinatus muscle, infraspinatus tendon, humeral head, scapula, dorsal glenoid rim, dorsal labrum, and the joint capsule. The relation of the humeral head to the glenoid can be judged statically and dynamically. Anterior and posterior instabilities and secondary signs of dislocation such as Hill-Sachs lesion and effusion can be seen. This technique is easy to learn. By comparing the injured with the normal shoulder the examiner can control his diagnosis. There is no need for positioning the patient in a special way. Sonographic evaluation is non-invasive and inexpensive."
CD009020,0,2740508,1,Rotator cuff tears: diagnostic performance of MR imaging.,"To determine the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of suspected rotator cuff tears, eight asymptomatic volunteers and 32 patients with rotator cuff tendonopathy who underwent surgery were examined with MR imaging. Twenty-four of these patients also underwent contrast arthrography. The ability of MR imaging to depict the size of cuff tears and the quality of torn tendon edges was also evaluated. The MR imaging and arthrographic studies were reviewed without knowledge of surgical results or of the other studies. A scoring system was developed and a score assigned to each patient's MR study. The sensitivity of MR imaging for all tears (partial and full thickness) was 0.91, and the specificity was 0.88; whereas the sensitivity and specificity of arthrography were each 0.71. The scoring system improved the sensitivity to 1.0 and the specificity to 0.92. Linear regression analysis showed excellent correlation between preoperative assessment of the size of rotator cuff tears and measurement at surgery (r = .95)."
CD009020,0,2663290,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is proving to be an effective means for evaluating the shoulder. The use of a surface coil and high resolution scanning techniques have allowed detailed analysis of the normal anatomy of the shoulder. When evaluating for shoulder pathology, the choice of imaging plane and pulse sequencing will be determined by the suspected pathology. In patients with impingement syndrome, subacromial bursitis, supraspinatus tendinitis, and supraspinatus tendon tear can be differentiated, and the offending component of the subacromial are traumatizing these soft tissues can be identified. MRI is also useful in determining the extent of retraction of the supraspinatus musculotendinous junction and the amount of muscle atrophy in cases of massive, chronic tears. Labral tear or attenuation due to glenohumeral instability can be imaged without the injection of contrast material, and MRI can identify those patients with multidirectional instability. Because of the ability to directly depict bone marrow, MRI is the imaging method of choice for the evaluation of early ischemic necrosis of the humeral head."
CD009020,0,2660541,1,"Rotator cuff tears: prospective comparison of MR imaging with arthrography, sonography, and surgery.","Thirty-eight patients with suspected rotator cuff tears were examined at 1.5 T by using a loop-gap resonator surface coil. The MR findings were compared prospectively in a blinded fashion with the results from double-contrast arthrography in all 38 patients, high-resolution sonography in 23 patients, and surgery in 16 patients. In the total group of 38 patients, MR imaging detected 22 of 22 tears and 14 of 16 intact cuffs as determined by arthrography. In the 16 surgically proved cases, MR and arthrography showed identical results, with 92% sensitivity in the diagnosis of 12 tears and 100% specificity in the diagnosis of four intact cuffs. In a subgroup of 23 patients, sonography detected nine of 15 tears and seven of eight intact cuffs as determined by comparison with arthrography. In 10 surgically proved cases, sonography was 63% sensitive in the diagnosis of eight rotator cuff tears and 50% specific in the diagnosis of two intact cuffs. For the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears, MR imaging is comparable to arthrography in both sensitivity and specificity. In this study, sonography was not as accurate in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears as were the other two techniques. These results suggest that MR imaging should be considered the noninvasive test of choice for patients with suspected rotator cuff disease."
CD009020,0,2749464,0,[Complete rotator cuff lesions in athletes].,"The causal etiologies of complete rotator cuff lesions are described. Handball, volleyball, rugby, throwing and putting disciplins, but also tennis, swimming, golf and artistic gymnastics are regarded as sports especially straining the periarticular structures of the shoulder joints. In the period from November 1980 to April 1986, 72 shoulder joints with complete rotator cuff lesions were treated surgically (bilaterally in three cases). The 69 patients comprised 16 recreational and 11 competitive sportsmen. An average of 2.4 years after the operation, 66 shoulder joints (91.6%) could followed up clinically and sonographically with simultaneous use of a 100-point-score. Good and very good results were shown in 70% of the cases."
CD009020,0,2544937,0,[Computed tomography of the rotator cuff--a comparison with other imaging technics].,"We consider CT to be suitable for investigating the following lesions of the rotator cuff: 1) tendopathia calcarea. 2) Rotator cuff atrophy suitable for surgery. 3) Bone defects. 4) Inflammatory changes with effusions. For demonstrating rotator cuff defects that might require surgery, we recommend CT arthrography, if possible with sagittal sections. This is particularly the case for younger patients with a history of trauma and evidence of a complex shoulder injury and in cases with persistent symptoms after surgical intervention of ineffective conservative treatment. CT, however, is only indicated if sonography supplies limited information or if sonography is negative with positive clinical findings."
CD009020,0,2727354,0,MRI demonstration of radiographically occult fractures: what have we been missing?,"During the course of MRI examinations of the knee for possible internal derangement, the hip for avascular necrosis, and the shoulder for rotator cuff tears, we have encountered many examples of unsuspected fractures of the tibial plateau, femoral condyles, pelvis, hip and proximal humerus. These fractures were either radiographically inapparent or demonstrated very subtle abnormalities that were missed on prospective interpretation. In addition, a large number of patients have been found to demonstrate evidence of intraosseous trabecular disruption, or edema and hemorrhage of medullary bone, or stress type injuries, all of which are radiographically occult. The clinical significance of these osseous abnormalities varies and is dependent upon the degree of injury. It is believed that an awareness of these osseous abnormalities will improve the accuracy of MRI interpretation, will heighten an appreciation of the subtle radiographic abnormalities that may be present, and will improve patient evaluation and management."
CD009020,0,2660887,0,Ultrasonography in lesions of the rotator cuff and biceps tendon.,"Ultrasonography (US) of the shoulder joint was performed in 88 patients, 15 of whom were referred for surgery. US was made with a real-time linear-array scanner, provided with a transducer of 7.5 MHz. Subsequently, all patients underwent single-contrast arthrography of the shoulder. When compared with the arthrographic findings, diagnosis by US showed 21 true positive, 3 false positive, 57 true negative and 7 false negative cases of a full-thickness tear of the rotator cuff. Small tears (2 cm or less in diameter) may be the most difficult to assess. US readily revealed biceps tendinitis and rupture of the biceps tendon, as well as fluid collection in the bursae above the rotator cuff tendons."
CD009020,0,2655152,0,[Sonography of the shoulder].,"Sonography is a valuable method for the detection of rotator cuff tears. A high resolution transducer and an experienced examiner are necessary. The rotator cuff is not visible in large tears and has a convex outer border in small tears. Sonography reveals pathology of the subacromial bursa, joint effusions, inflammatory tissue in rheumatoid arthritis and often also bony erosions and tendon calcifications. Arthrography is still indicated in equivocal cases. Arthro-CT is the method of choice for the diagnosis of limbus and capsular pathology, but not for rotator cuff tears. MRI shows promising results in rotator cuff tears, but its role has not been definitively assessed."
CD009020,0,2652050,0,Arthroscopy update #3. Chronic impingement syndrome. The role of ultrasonography and arthroscopic anterior acromioplasty.,"Diagnosis of advanced rotator cuff impingement syndrome has been difficult due to dependence on plain radiographs and arthrography, which in the absence of complete tears are frequently inconclusive. Advances in ultrasonography have enabled accurate diagnosis of the more enigmatic partial thickness tears of the rotator cuff. Until recently, advanced impingement syndrome resistant to conservative therapy has been managed by open anterior acromioplasty as described by Neer. This has required a prolonged postoperative rehabilitation program before return to normal activities of daily living and athletic participation. Precise diagnosis with ultrasonography and refined arthroscopic techniques have enabled us to identify 50 patients with resistant impingement syndrome and partial thickness tears of the rotator cuff, and surgically decompress the subacromial space via arthroscopic resection of the coracoacromial ligament and anterior-inferior leading edge of the acromion. Postoperatively there has been minimal pain. Return of nearly full passive range of motion has been achieved in all but two patients within the first week. Active range of motion exercises are begun on the first postoperative day and resistive exercises commence two weeks after surgery. Mean return of normal functioning in activities of daily living has been two months, while return to prior level of athletic activity has averaged five months."
CD009020,0,2659355,0,Ultrasonography of the tendons of the shoulder.,"The purpose of the present study was to compare ultrasonographic signs with macroscopic and histological findings in lesions of the rotator cuff and the biceps tendon. Twenty-six shoulder joints from 10 male and 3 female cadavers, ranging in age from 40 to 89 years (mean 65.9), were examined with a linear array real-time ultrasonographic scanner provided with a 7.5 MHz transducer. Arthrotomy and histological preparations were made after ultrasonography. Thinning and discontinuity of echogenic homogenicity of the tendons of the rotator cuff were the most reliable ultrasonographic signs of a total tear of the tendon, but focal hyper- and hypo-echogenic changes of the tendons of the rotator cuff were unreliable criteria. Partial tears of the rotator cuff were difficult to determine with static ultrasonograms. Ultrasonography readily revealed discontinuity of echogenic homogenicity of the biceps tendon as a sign of a rupture of the tendon, which was commonly associated with rotator cuff tears."
CD009020,0,2648745,0,Sonography in soft-tissue trauma of the shoulder.,"Seventy-five patients with soft-tissue trauma in the shoulder region were examined by ultrasonography. Normal conditions were found in 21 patients, distension of the acromioclavicular joint in 17, muscle hematoma or edema in 9, biceps tendinitis in 8, hematoma or partial rupture of the biceps tendon in 5, rupture of the biceps tendon in 1, and supraspinatus tendinitis or partial rupture in 14. A correlation was found between the sonography and clinical course; normal sonography was consistent with recovery in less than 1 week, whereas patients with pathologic changes in the supraspinatus or biceps tendon generally had symptoms for at least 1 month. We concluded that sonography is a useful diagnostic tool for evaluation of soft-tissue trauma in the shoulder."
CD009020,0,2675745,0,[Modern imaging in radioanatomic study of the shoulder].,"The authors describe the most appropriate imaging technique or techniques for assessment of each anatomical structure in the shoulder: the head of the humerus, socket, acromion, joint space, labrum, musculotendinous structures of the supraspinatus, subscapularis and long biceps muscles. The techniques used are the most useful view of standard X-rays, as well as arthropathy, CT scan, arthroscan, ultrasonography and MRI. This is a preliminary study to assessment of shoulder lesions. In the shoulder, radiologists are frequently required to identify the anatomical disorder as exactly as possible without falling into the traps associated with all forms of imaging even the most sophisticated."
CD009020,0,2665103,0,Limited sensitivity of ultrasound for the detection of rotator cuff tears.,"Bilateral rotator cuff sonography was performed on 56 patients referred for shoulder arthrography to detect rotator cuff tears. Since one patient had bilateral arthrography there were 57 arthrograms. Twenty-seven shoulders had rotator cuff tears shown on arthrography, 15 of which were detected by sonography. Eleven were false negative by sonography, and one was indeterminate. Of the 30 shoulders with negative arthrograms, 28 had normal sonograms and two were false positive. Sensitivity was 58%, specificity was 93% and overall accuracy was 77%. The positive and negative predictive values were 88% and 72%. These results suggest that sonography has limited value in screening patients for rotator cuff tears and that a positive sonographic reading is more reliable than a negative one. Theories relating to the variable anatomic configuration of a tear are postulated to explain these results, which differ from those previously reported."
CD009020,0,3055040,1,Rotator cuff tears: correlation of sonographic and surgical findings.,"High-resolution, real-time sonography of the rotator cuff was performed in 51 shoulders, and the results were correlated with findings obtained during subsequent surgery. Prospective sensitivity of sonography in detection of a tear was 100%; specificity, 75%; and accuracy, 92%. Retrospective estimation of tear size on sonograms correlated well with the intraoperative measurements for small and moderate lesions. Large lesions were often underestimated sonographically. Retrospectively, partial tears were correctly diagnosed in seven patients, and bursal thickening was recognized in 17 patients. Sonography of the shoulder proved to be an accurate, noninvasive method for the diagnosis of complete rotator cuff tears. It is useful for estimating tear size and location and may be useful in recognizing partial tears."
CD009020,0,3183135,0,The painful shoulder: MR imaging of the glenohumeral joint.,"We used magnetic resonance imaging in 41 patients with shoulder pain. Magnetic resonance was found useful in depicting the spectrum of rotator cuff abnormalities associated with mechanical impingement including both large and small rotator cuff tears as well as tendinitis. Abnormalities of the capsular mechanism, osseous tumors, osteonecrosis, and injuries to the supporting musculature are also well depicted."
CD009020,0,3142923,0,Clinical significance of sonographic findings in the abnormal but intact rotator cuff: a preliminary report.,"Shoulder pain is a common orthopedic problem. Clinical examination is often nonspecific and arthrography is normal in those patients with the most frequent cause of shoulder pain--noncalcific tendonitis secondary to impingement. Ultrasonography has recently shown itself to be of value in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. In addition to the diagnosis of tears, however, sonography can demonstrate abnormalities within the intact rotator cuff tendon. These abnormalities consist of changes in echogenicity and thickness of the tendon. The patterns of abnormality demonstrated correlate with pathologic changes seen in tendonitis. This preliminary study suggests that the ability to demonstrate an abnormal rotator cuff tendon has potential for becoming a valuable aid to the orthopedist in allowing confident diagnosis of rotator cuff disease in the presence of nonspecific symptomatology and an intact tendon."
CD009020,0,3262276,1,MR imaging diagnosis of rotator cuff tears.,"Thirty-one symptomatic patients were studied with MR imaging to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of shoulder MR in the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. Correlative studies included arthroscopy in 19 patients and arthrography in 12 patients. Images were obtained on either a 0.5- or 1.5-T Philips superconducting magnet using spin-echo pulse sequences (650-850/30 [TR, TE], 2000/30, 100) with 5-mm slices oriented in an oblique coronal plane perpendicular to the glenohumeral joint. The MR studies were initially interpreted without knowledge of the results of other diagnostic procedures. The MR diagnosis of cuff tear was made when irregularity, discontinuity, and increased signal were identified in the rotator cuff. MR images showed tears in 10 patients (32%) and were negative for tear in 21 patients (68%). MR correlated with arthroscopy and arthrography in 17 of 18 normal patients, in eight of 10 patients with complete tears, and in one of three patients with partial tears. For complete rotator cuff tears, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 80%, 94%, and 89%, respectively. For all tears (partial and complete), the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 69%, 94%, and 84%, respectively. These data suggest that MR imaging is an accurate procedure for the diagnosis of complete rotator cuff tears. The number of partial tears (three) in this series is too small to evaluate the value of MR imaging in the diagnosis of partial tears."
CD009020,0,2845510,0,[Sonographic evaluation of the rotator cuff following reconstruction of complete ruptures].,"This is a report on the results of a clinical and sonographical re-examination of 66 shoulder joints after reconstruction of complete rotator cuff tears. One-third of the patients were asymptomatic, in more than half of them pre-operatively existing complaints had improved, and in 15% no improvement was seen. Clinical findings were without abnormalities in half of the patients. In as many patients indications were found of a still existing rotator cuff syndrome. Sonographically, in 49 out of 66 cases the continuity of the rotator cuff was maintained. In 17 cases indications of tears were found. Remarkable features were, in rotator cuffs with maintained tendon continuity, in 50% of the shoulder joints a thinning out of the tendon and/or echogenic patterns. Tears in the non-operated opposite side were found in 7 cases and thinning out and/or enhanced echogenicity in 12 cases."
CD009020,0,3406398,0,Shoulder instability: evaluation with MR imaging.,"Instability of the glenohumeral joint is a common cause of chronic shoulder pain and disability. One or more episodes of subluxation or dislocation may result in a tear, detachment, or attenuation of the glenoid labrum, stripping of the joint capsule from the scapula, or trauma to the tendons or muscles of the rotator cuff. A series of 27 shoulders examined with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed changes of glenohumeral instability, which were confirmed with open or arthroscopic surgery. MR imaging was capable of displaying common types of pathologic conditions resulting from instability, including labral trauma, capsular detachment, and retraction of the subscapularis muscle. MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool for the evaluation of glenohumeral instability."
CD009020,0,3071007,0,[Sonographic assessment of typical lesions in shoulder dislocation].,"The traumatic dislocation of the shoulder joint is the most often joint luxation. The involved patients are often sporting and between the age of 20 to 40 years. The therapeutic and prognostic point of interest is to recognize and reconstruct injured structures. Among the soft tissue injuries the Bankart lesions, among the osseous injuries the Hill-Sachs defect are numeric well to the fore. Hitherto existing diagnostic methods for these injuries are either invasive or with X-rays. Its is demonstrated, that dynamic ultrasonography examination of the shoulder joint can visualize besides the rotator cuff abnormalities of the labrum glenoidale and the caput humeri outline."
CD009020,0,3044661,0,Sonographic evaluation of the rotator cuff. Accuracy in patients without prior surgery.,"Since 1982 a sonographic technique has been devised to evaluate the integrity of the rotator cuff. In a series of 139 shoulders in 134 consecutive patients without prior surgery, sonographic results were correlated with surgical findings and/or arthrography. When sonography was compared with surgical findings (n = 90 shoulders), the overall accuracy was 95%. The sonographic diagnosis was the same as the arthrographic diagnosis in 91% of the cases (n = 50). Cuff lesions were also created in two cadavers, and images were made to confirm sonographic appearances. Because in the authors' experience sonography is accurate, safe, painless, rapid, and inexpensive, it has now been adopted as the primary study for the examination of the rotator cuff at the authors' institution. Arthrography is recommended in cases in which sonography is negative but there is significant clinical evidence of rotator cuff tear."
CD009020,0,3152389,1,Ultrasonography of rotator cuff tears: a review of 500 diagnostic studies.,"Ultrasonography of the rotator cuff has been shown to be of value in diagnosing rotator cuff tears. This report summarizes our experience with our first 500 diagnostic examinations. All patients were examined in the hyperextended internal rotation view with commercially available high-resolution real-time ultrasound equipment. Patients were diagnosed as having a rotator cuff tear if a focal echogenic lesion or a defect within the rotator cuff was identified. This study confirmed the value of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity all exceeded 90%, and correlated with surgical findings. This was better than arthrography in the same patient population. Ultrasound is an accurate noninvasive method of examining the rotator cuff for the presence of tears. We suggest that rotator cuff ultrasonography is the procedure of choice for the diagnosis of tears if adequate instrumentation is available."
CD009020,0,3289928,1,Value of ultrasonography in preoperative diagnosis of rotator cuff tears and postoperative follow-up.,"Four hundred and six patients presenting with shoulder pain underwent bilateral shoulder ultrasonography. Rotator cuff lesions were diagnosed in 197 patients. In 155 of the 308 patients who had additional arthrographic examinations, the arthrogram documented rotator cuff tears. Sixty-eight patients underwent surgery. There was good correlation between the ultrasonographic and arthrographic findings as well as the surgical results, with a sensitivity of 91% for each examination technique. Thirty-six postoperative patients were studied ultrasonographically; a minor to marked increase in rotator cuff echogenicity was demonstrated in them all. Its high predictive value makes ultrasonography the method of choice in diagnosing rotator cuff tears. Based on the evaluation of particular criteria, rotator cuff tears (greater than 1 cm) are commonly documented by ultrasonography. Only in patients with indeterminate or negative ultrasonograms in whom there is a high index of clinical suspicion, should arthrography be performed as a complementary imaging test. In postoperative follow-up the degree of scar formation at the reinsertion of the tendon is adequately documented by ultrasonography."
CD009020,0,3282405,0,Sonography of the postoperative shoulder.,"Fifty-three patients with 60 symptomatic shoulders underwent shoulder sonography for recurrent postoperative symptoms after either acromioplasty (10 shoulders) or repair of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear in addition to acromioplasty (50 shoulders). Because surgery distorts landmarks, an understanding of the surgical procedures and their characteristic sonographic appearances is essential. After acromioplasty, the characteristic sharp margination or the acromion was replaced by a less distinct, irregular surface. After repair of a cuff tear, characteristic sonographic appearances included visualization of a reimplantation trough and loss of the echogenic subdeltoid bursa. When the cuff was intact after surgery, echogenicity was abnormal in all cases (17 shoulders). Sonography accurately diagnosed recurrent cuff tears in all 26 shoulders in which surgical proof was available and confirmed an intact cuff in 10 of 11 cases. In one shoulder, a cuff hematoma was incorrectly interpreted as a full-thickness tear. These findings suggest that sonography is an effective procedure for evaluating a postoperative patient with recurrent shoulder symptoms."
CD009020,0,3363114,0,[Possibilities of magnetic resonance tomography in diagnostic imaging of the shoulder joint].,"By virtue of its multiplanar representation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows clear visualization of the complex anatomical relationships of the shoulder joint. In addition to axial planes, slices perpendicular and parallel to the glenoid cavity are used to good advantage. In tears of the rotator cuff an increase in signal intensity within the cuff is recognized in T2- and proton-density-weighted images. Lesions of the glenoid labrum following luxations of the glenohumeral joint can be detected and classified using MRI. The diagnostic value of MRI as compared with other imaging modalities will have to be evaluated in larger series with operative verification."
CD009020,0,3363113,0,[Significance of a transthoracic imaging technic in shoulder arthrography].,"Even in this era of sonography, arthrography of the shoulder is an important diagnostic investigation, making it possible to exclude unrecognized connective tissue lesions in patients with chronic shoulder pain resistant to therapy. Sometimes standard X-ray techniques do not yield all the information the surgeon needs about ventral or dorsal localization of a rotator-cuff rupture. An additional approach to the joint is needed: a transthoracic lateral-view X-ray provides the surgeon with adequate information to help in selection of the most appropriate operative approach to the shoulder."
CD009020,0,3283828,0,"[Sonography of the shoulder joint. Study technic, sonomorphology and diagnostic significance].","In the evaluation of the impingement syndrome, conventional radiography can only show secondary bony changes. Sonography is able to demonstrate the anatomy of the musculotendinous structure of the rotator cuff. Lesions can be detected with the same accuracy and specificity as by contrast arthrography. As sonography is a non-invasive method, it should be used routinely to test rotator cuff integrity. Joint effusions and proliferative synovial changes are easily demonstrated by sonography. It is thus possible to perform follow-up studies in a pre-erosive stage of rheumatoid arthritis."
CD009020,0,3257322,1,Shoulder impingement syndrome: MR findings in 53 shoulders.,"The shoulder impingement syndrome refers to a condition in which the supraspinatus tendon and subacromial bursa are chronically entrapped between the humeral head inferiorly and either the anterior acromion itself, spurs of the anterior acromion or acromioclavicular joint, or the coracoacromial ligament superiorly. As a result, the space for the bursa and tendon is reduced, and repeated trauma to these structures leads to bursitis and rotator cuff injury. Although pain and limitation of motion are common early findings, the diagnosis is often delayed until a complete tear of the rotator cuff has occurred. In an attempt to determine if MR can be used to depict the abnormalities associated with impingement syndrome (subacromial bursitis, supraspinatus tendinitis, and rotator cuff tear), we reviewed 107 MR scans of painful shoulders. Changes consistent with impingement syndrome were found in 53 patients (50%), 32 of whom underwent subsequent arthrography or surgery. MR was found capable of depicting several soft-tissue and bony abnormalities that have been clinically described in impingement syndrome. In regions of inflammation, we found that the supraspinatus tendon and/or the subacromial bursa were compressed by spurs (25 shoulders), capsular hypertrophy of the acromioclavicular joint (six shoulders), and/or low-lying acromion (14 shoulders). While T1-weighted MR imaging was highly sensitive to abnormalities of the supraspinatus tendon, tendinitis could be differentiated from a small tear of the supraspinatus tendon only with T2-weighted imaging. Large, full-thickness tears, especially if chronic, produced characteristic MR findings on both T1- and T2-weighted images. We conclude that MR can be used to detect several abnormalities associated with the shoulder impingement syndrome."
CD009020,0,3336681,0,Rotator cuff impingement syndrome: MR imaging.,"Ten patients with clinically suspected rotator cuff impingement syndrome were evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, double contrast arthrography, and conventional radiography. An area of increased signal intensity in the tendinous portion of the rotator cuff was seen in eight of ten patients on images obtained with a short repetition time (TR) and short echo time (TE) and those obtained with a long TR and long TE with spin-echo sequences. Microscopic findings, available in five patients, indicated that these areas of increased intensity corresponded to degeneration and inflammation of the rotator cuff. A previously injected long-acting steroid preparation combined with a local anesthetic, which also produces an area of increased signal intensity on long TR, long TE images, can cause problems with image interpretation. No tears of the rotator cuff were detected with MR imaging. However, a full-thickness cuff tear was detected with arthrography in three patients. Although based on a relatively small group of patients, these preliminary findings suggest that MR imaging is capable of demonstrating rotator cuff abnormalities in patients with impingement syndrome."
CD009020,0,3282806,0,Current concepts in the radiographic evaluation of the rotator cuff.,"This review discusses the disease of the rotator cuff and evaluates our current tools for imaging it. The rotator cuff consists of the cojoined tendons of the short rotator muscles of the shoulder. Derangements of the cuff, which can result from degeneration, trauma, or overuse, are frequent causes of shoulder pain. Until the present decade, imaging of the cuff depended on injection of contrast into either the underlying joint (arthrogram) or overlying bursa (bursogram). Computed tomography (CT) has added additional dimensions to arthrography but has not played a major role in the diagnosis of cuff pathology. Ultrasonography (US) has been shown to be of diagnostic value in imaging cuff tears and has shown promise in defining pathology in the intact cuff. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential for imaging the cuff; its roles here are not yet defined."
CD009020,0,3281690,1,Sonographic evaluation of the rotator cuff: correlation with arthroscopy.,"High-resolution real-time sonography has been reported as a non-invasive means of evaluating the integrity of the rotator cuff. Fifty-two patients underwent both sonographic and arthroscopic evaluation of the rotator cuff. There were 42 men and 10 women with an average age of 47 years (range 28-71 years). The duration of shoulder pain averaged 24 months (range 3 months to 9 years). Thirty-five rotator cuff tears were noted arthroscopically. Twenty-seven of the tears were diagnosed by sonography for a sensitivity rate of 77%. Eleven of the 17 intact rotator cuffs were normal by sonography for a specificity rate 65%. The overall accuracy of sonography was 73% and the predictive value of a positive sonogram was 82%. Sonography appears to be a good initial screening examination in evaluating the integrity of the rotator cuff. It is noninvasive and relatively inexpensive. Technical limitations of this technique as well as the experience of the radiologist in performing and interpreting the examination play a major role in the accuracy of this test. As instrumentation improves and as experience in using this technique increases, we expect the accuracy of sonography in detecting tears of the rotator cuff to continue to improve."
CD009020,0,3275956,0,Sonographic evaluation of the rotator cuff.,"This article emphasizes the utility of ultrasound examination in the diagnosis of rotator cuff disease. A complete description is given of the way in which ultrasound examination of the shoulder is performed, the illustrations demonstrating normal anatomy as well as staging of the disease. The use of ultrasound in this setting can help to prevent a great deal of the pain associated with shoulder injury by establishing the nature and stage of injury before rotator cuff tear occurs."

Diagnostic possibilities in lesions of the rotator cuff].,"Twenty five healthy people and 25 patients with shoulder pain underwent US control over a 12-month period: 24 patients with shoulder pain had rotator cuff and/or biceps tendon lesions. The US findings on rotator cuff and biceps tendon lesions are compared with those of arthrography and/or surgery (96% sensitivity). US is rapid, safe, non invasive, inexpensive and often more accurate, and its use is recommended for the routine examination of the shoulder joint instead of arthrography."
CD009020,0,3496760,1,MR imaging of the shoulder: diagnosis of rotator cuff tears.,"Twenty-five patients with known or suspected tears of the rotator cuff in 26 shoulders underwent MR imaging. All patients also underwent arthrography or surgery. MR visualized abnormalities consistent with a tear in 20 of the 22 tears diagnosed by arthrography or surgery. In most cases, tears were seen as regions of increased signal intensity within the cuff on long-TR pulse sequences, although two cases simply showed an almost complete absence of normal cuff. The MR appearance of the two cases with partial tears was similar to that of full-thickness tears. Of the four cases with normal arthrograms, one case had MR findings consistent with a tear. We conclude that MR has good potential for the noninvasive diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. Its ultimate role in this diagnosis must await prospective studies comparing its accuracy with that of sonography, CT, and arthrography."

In comparison to arthrography it is a quick and painless method without any risk. Whereas other authors report a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94% in shoulder disease we recommend ultrasonography in acute shoulder trauma as a screening method. Pathological findings in ultrasonography will make the decision for arthrography easy. The major diagnostic pitfall is the calcified tendon of the rotator cuff.

CD009020,0,3695819,0,The rotator cuff tear: MR evaluation.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is evolving as a particularly valuable diagnostic procedure in the evaluation of musculoskeletal pathology. To assess the role of MRI as applied to the shoulder, we examined eight normal volunteers, six patients with seven arthrographically proven rotator cuff tears and two patients with impingement symptomatology but with negative double contrast conventional and computed tomographic arthrography. The studies were performed on a 1-Tesla magnet operating at 0.5 Tesla. Coronal T1-weighted images were obtained in all cases and coronal spin density and T2-weighted pulse sequences were employed in two cases. In the normal individuals, the supraspinatus muscle and tendon could be consistently demonstrated. The proximal humeral marrow, the superior glenoid labrum, and the acromioclavicular joint could also be examined. Findings in patients with rotator cuff tears included: (1) hypointense gap within the supraspinatus muscle-tendon complex on T1-weighted sequences, (2) absence of a demonstrable supraspinatus tendon with narrowing of the subacromial space secondary to elevation of the humeral head, and (3) increased signal within the supraspinatus tendon on T2-weighted images. In the patients with impingement syndrome and negative arthrography, MR demonstrated elevation of the supraspinatus tendon with subacromial impingement in one case and a normal supraspinatus tendon in the other. Impingement on the coracoacroaminal arch causes progressive fibrosis, atrophy, and eventual tear of the rotator cuff. The potential applications of MRI relative to the shoulder include assessment of tendon retraction in patients with supraspinatus tears and noninvasive evaluation of patients with impingement syndrome, permitting etiologic determinations, hopefully before irreversible tendon injury has occurred."
CD009020,0,3616667,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of glenohumeral joint diseases.,"Through the application of oblique planes and flexible surface coil techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) promises to be of great clinical value in the evaluation of a variety of pathologic conditions affecting the shoulder. In patients with joint effusions, the tendinous portion of the rotator cuff, glenoid labrum, and bicipital tendon can be readily visualized. This capability has particular relevance in patients with inflammatory disease and traumatic conditions. Rotator cuff atrophy and impingement of the coracoacromial arc upon the supraspinatus muscle and tendon can also be demonstrated. MRI is also useful in the evaluation of shoulder instability."
CD009020,0,3737908,0,Rotator cuff tears: preliminary application of high-resolution MR imaging with counter rotating current loop-gap resonators.,"A new class of radio frequency (RF) coils for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy is introduced. The coils consist of two loop-gap resonators of equal diameters positioned along a common axis. They are tuned to the mode in which the current in the two loops flows in opposite directions. These coils are ""decoupled"" from a uniform excitation field of arbitrary orientation (including circularly polarized fields) by intrinsic decoupling and by means of back-to-back fast recovery diodes. Measurements made with the coils and a phantom saline tank indicate that the signal-to-noise ratio obtainable with these coils is almost identical to that obtained with single loops. Imaging of several anatomic areas, including knee, wrist, and shoulder, has been performed with a 1.5-T MR system that uses circularly polarized RF. A small series of patients with torn rotator cuffs underwent imaging. Difficulties in establishing the diagnosis with MR imaging because of anatomic complexity are illustrated. The value of pulse sequences with long repetition times to increase the signal intensity of fluid in the joint is shown."

CD009020,0,3534994,0,[Rotator cuff ruptures of the shoulder joint. Sonography--arthrography].,"47 patients suspected of rupture of the rotator cuff were sonographed and arthrographed. Rupture of the rotator cuff was diagnosed in 12 cases, both diagnostic methods yielding the same result. In 29 patients sonography and arthrography did not reveal any abnormal findings. Six ruptures evident in sonography were not confirmed by arthrography and were considered false positive. Direct pointers towards rupture of the cuff would be: echoless defects, cuff cannot be visualised fully or in part, irregularities of movement during dynamic examination. Echoless ""cystic"" areas in the periarticular soft parts must be considered an indirect pointer. Echorich focal findings in the echopoor cuff represent a differential diagnostic problem and we cannot give a final assessment as yet. Shoulder sonography is justified as a screening method in suspicion of rotator cuff rupture before initiating arthrography. If sonography reveals no abnormal findings, shoulder arthrography need not be performed."

So far, lesions of the rotator cuff and of the long head of the biceps could only be demonstrated by invasive procedures such as arthrography or arthroscopy. In these situations, sonography attains a similar accuracy. Diffuse lesions can also be diagnosed correctly, making arthrography and arthroscopy unnecessary. In addition, sonography can demonstrate inflammatory and degenerative changes and incomplete sub-acromial and intermediary tears of the rotator cuff, unlike conventional diagnostic methods. In future, arthrography and arthroscopy will only be necessary as additional diagnostic methods if sonography remains inconclusive."
CD009020,0,3512571,0,Ultrasonographic evaluation of the rotator cuff and biceps tendon.,"Ultrasonography of the rotator cuff and biceps tendon was investigated in 106 patients who had been referred for arthrography of the shoulder. Both the sensitivity and the specificity of ultrasound in detecting a tear of the rotator cuff were 91 per cent. The predictive value of a negative sonogram was 95 per cent and the predictive value of a positive sonogram was 84 per cent. Ultrasonography proved to be superior to arthrography in the examination of the normal and abnormal biceps tendon. Sonographically detectable effusions from the tendon sheath of the biceps were present in 19 per cent of this population of patients. This finding was statistically highly associated (90 per cent) with rotator cuff tears and other soft-tissue abnormalities of the shoulder. Based on these results, it appears that ultrasonography can be used as the initial imaging test for many patients with suspected abnormalities of the rotator cuff or biceps tendon."
CD009020,0,3511640,0,Sonography of the postoperative rotator cuff.,"In experienced hands, high-resolution real-time sonography has been shown to be an accurate noninvasive method for diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. The sonographic appearance of the postoperative rotator cuff has not been previously reported. Forty postoperative patients were studied sonographically 1 week to 6 years after rotator cuff repair. The postoperative rotator cuff is abnormally echogenic and can be very similar in appearance to a small rotator cuff tear in a nonoperated patient. Soft-tissue planes about the tendon are distorted or absent. Criteria for diagnosis of retear must be different from those used in detecting new tears in a nonoperated cuff. Postoperative echogenicity is normal, but the finding of a defect or gap within the rotator cuff tendon is the only accurate sign of a recurrent rotator cuff tear."
CD009020,0,3511639,0,Pitfalls of rotator cuff sonography.,"Experience with rotator cuff sonography in 106 patients was analyzed to identify the causes of scan misinterpretation. Possible interpretive errors may be classified into four categories: those from failure to recognize normal anatomy, those caused by soft-tissue abnormalities, those caused by bony abnormalities, and those caused by technical limitations of the study. Errors in recognition of normal anatomy are easily overcome by experience and comparison to the normal, contralateral rotator cuff. Errors resulting from soft-tissue abnormalities were seen in two patients with calcific tendinitis simulating rotator cuff tears. Problems in interpretation resulting from fractures in two patients and inferior glenohumeral subluxation in two other patients could have been avoided by review of the plain films before performing sonography. The major technical limitation of the study arises from the inability to image the rotator cuff beneath the acromion. Fortunately, rotator cuff tears are rarely isolated in this location, and passive maneuvers often allow otherwise hidden parts of the cuff to be imaged."

CD009020,0,3514025,0,Diagnostic value of sonography in lesions of the biceps tendon.,"Lesions of the biceps tendon have been studied with plain radiographs and arthrograms of the intertubercular groove. Sometimes, however, especially when the rotator cuff has a full-thickness tear anteriorly, the sheath of the biceps tendon fails to fill with contrast medium, thus preventing diagnosis of dislocation of the tendon. To solve this problem the authors have tried sonography of the biceps tendon. The suitability of sonography for examining the intertubercular groove and the biceps tendon was assessed in ten volunteers. Thirty patients with chronic shoulder pain were subsequently studied by radiography, arthrography, and sonography. The observations made with these examinations were compared, and in 21 of the patients who were treated by operation with the surgical observations as well. Sonography seemed to provide accurate information about the configuration of the intertubercular groove and the position of the biceps tendon. The technique could be used to show dislocation of the tendon in cases in which the tendon sheath is not visualized in arthrography. Tenderness and the site of this in relation to the anterior upper end of the humerus could also be verified with sonography."

CD009020,0,3898216,1,US evaluation of the rotator cuff.,"Ultrasonographic (US) evaluation of the moving shoulder is a new method for evaluating the integrity of the rotator cuff. In the past, contrast arthrography has provided the only nonoperative technique for demonstrating defects in the rotator cuff. We present the details of this new technique and describe 79 patients whose US results were correlated with the findings at arthrography and/or surgery. US allows evaluation of both shoulders at once, an advantage over arthrography, where usually only one side is evaluated at a single sitting. Improvements in US instrumentation, especially the introduction of high-resolution linear-array devices and the use of experienced ultrasonographers, have improved the accuracy of US. Because US is rapid, safe, noninvasive, and inexpensive, we advocate its use instead of arthrography as the routine test of rotator cuff integrity."
CD009020,0,3897119,0,Ultrasonography of the rotator cuff. Normal and pathologic anatomy.,"Forty-eight patients with shoulder pain and 15 normal volunteers underwent rotator cuff imaging using high resolution real time ultrasound. The potential diagnostic value of sonography in detecting rotator cuff tears was evaluated by correlating ultrasound findings with surgical findings in 19 patients, 12 of whom also underwent preoperative arthrography. The preoperative ultrasound diagnosis was correct in 18 of the 19 patients undergoing surgery for possible rotator cuff tears. In the group of 12 surgical patients undergoing both preoperative arthrography and sonography, ultrasound correctly predicted the presence of a rotator cuff tear in 12 of 12 patients, while arthrography predicted cuff tears in only nine of 12. Good anatomic definition of the rotator cuff was obtained in both symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. The characteristic appearance of the normal and pathologic rotator cuff is described. Rotator cuff sonography promises to be a valuable new diagnostic tool for evaluating patients with suspected rotator cuff tears."
CD009020,0,3880983,0,Sonographic detection of rotator cuff tears.,"Thirty-nine consecutive patients referred for shoulder arthrography underwent shoulder sonography to determine the ability of sonography to detect rotator cuff tears. Fifteen patients had arthrographically proven rotator cuff tears. Of these, 14 were detected by sonography, for a sensitivity of 93%. The three sonographic criteria indicative of rotator cuff tear were (1) discontinuity in the normal homogeneous echogenicity of the rotator cuff; (2) replacement of the normal homogeneous echogenicity by a central echogenic band; and (3) nonvisualization of the cuff. Twenty patients had normal sonographic examinations, 19 of which were normal by arthrography. Therefore, the predictive value of a negative sonogram was 95%. On the basis of these findings, sonography can provide a noninvasive means of screening patients with suspected rotator cuff tears."
CD009020,0,6436327,1,Ultrasonography of the rotator cuff: surgical correlation.,Rotator cuff tears are a common orthopedic problem. The portions of the cuff most commonly torn are accessible to sonographic examination with appropriate positioning of the shoulder. This study was undertaken to correlate the sonographic appearance of the pathologic rotator cuff with findings at the time of surgical repair. Rotator cuff tears are readily seen with high-resolution real-time sonography. Sonography can demonstrate tears not demonstrated arthrographically. In the appropriate clinical setting arthrography may not be necessary if the sonogram demonstrates characteristic findings.
CD009020,0,9697646,0,Impingement syndrome in the athletic shoulder.,"The repetitive overhead use of the arm required by many sports may lead to impingement in the vulnerable avascular region of the supraspinatus and biceps tendons. The impingement syndrome may spill over at any time to involve the adjacent biceps tendon, subacromial bursa, and acromioclavicular joint and, as a continuum, with the passage of time, may eventuate in degeneration and partial, even complete thickness, rotator cuff tears later in life. Physical findings, particularly a positive impingement sign, confirm the diagnosis. In the young competing athlete, therapeutic measures consist of careful warm-up exercises, occasional rest by avoidance of the offending movement, and local modalities of ice, ultrasound, and transcutaneous stimulation along with anti-inflammatory medications. Surgical decompression achieved by resecting the coracoacromial ligament or a more definitive anterior acromioplasty may rarely be indicated."
CD009020,0,7377445,0,Impingement syndrome in athletes.,"Athletes, particularly those who are involved in sporting activities requiring repetitive overhead use of the arm (for example, tennis players, swimmers, baseball pitchers, and quarterbacks), may develop a painful shoulder. This is often due to impingement in the vulnerable avascular region of the supraspinatus and biceps tendons. With the passage of time, degeneration and tears of the rotator cuff may result. Pathologically the syndrome has been classified into Stage I (edema and hemorrhage), Stage II (fibrosis and tendonitis), and Stage III (tendon degeneration, bony changes, and tendon ruptures). The impingement syndrome may be a problem for the young, active, and competitive athlete as well as the casual weekend athlete. The ""impingement sign"" which reproduces pain and resulting facial expression when the arm is forceably forward flexed (jamming the greater tuberosity against the anteroinferior surface of the acromion) is the most reliable physical sign in establishing the diagnosis. Flexibility exercises, strengthening programs, and special training techniques are a preventive and treatment requirement. Rest and local modalities such as ice, ultrasound, and antiinflammatory agents are usually effective to lessen the inflammatory reaction. Surgical decompression by resecting the coracoacromial ligament or a more definitive anterior acromioplasty may rarely be indicated."
CD009020,0,6036453,0,An exercise program for shoulder disability.,"In disabling conditions of the shoulder the involvement is either primary or secondary in origin. The primary disabilities are usually caused by sudden direct trauma or repeated minor traumata. Bursitis, tendonitis, and minor tears of the rotator cuff may result. The disabilities which arise secondarily are more difficult to treat and may have prolonged sequelae. Cervical radiculitis, infectious mononeuritis, cardiac disease, and cerebrovascular disease are common sources for secondary shoulder involvement. Pain and limitation of motion with loss of function are the presenting symptoms. The selection of a proper program of therapy is determined by the diagnosis. Primary conditions are responsive to the usual physical measures of moist heat, ultrasound, and the common exercises. Injections of local anesthestics or steroids and use of deep x-ray therapy may also be effective. The disabilities which arise secondarily are more difficult to treat and often become chronic and intolerably painful. In the author's experience, the most effective treatment for the secondarily induced shoulder problem is the combined use of moist heat of mild intensity, manual mobilization, neuromuscular facilitation, and a suitable home program of appropriate exercise."
