CD009185,0,9655361,0,Technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy in children over 5 years.,"We retrospectively evaluated the frequency of renal scintigraphic abnormalities in children over 5 years admitted with a first symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). Among 261 children investigated, we found only 23 over 5 years having had technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy during the acute phase of a first UTI. Obvious scintigraphic abnormalities were detected in 14 children (15 kidneys): 12 kidneys showed focal cortical defects and 3 were small and deformed. Ultrasound was normal in 7 of the 15 kidneys with abnormal scintigraphy and in all the kidneys with normal scintigraphy. Among the 12 kidneys with focal cortical lesions, 8 kidneys returned to normal or improved considerably 2-12 months after initial work-up. In conclusion, in children over 5 years admitted with a first symptomatic UTI, the frequency of scintigraphic abnormalities is high and a strategy based only on ultrasound data would miss about 50% of the abnormal kidneys."
CD009185,0,3062784,0,"Correlative imaging in abdominal infection: an algorithmic approach using nuclear medicine, ultrasound, and computed tomography.","A wide variety of focal and diffuse infectious processes involve the abdomen. At one extreme are diseases such as pyelonephritis, cystitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease, conditions usually diagnosed without imaging studies and treated without complications. At the other extreme are abdominal abscesses, which may defy clinical diagnosis, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and may remain undetected or insufficiently characterized in spite of multiple imaging studies. The limited diagnostic value of clinical evaluation and plain film radiography in abscess detection has lead to widespread use of sophisticated imaging techniques including Gallium-67 (67Ga) scintigraphy, Indium-111 WBC (111In-WBC) scintigraphy, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography (US). Abdominal abscesses occur in a wide variety of anatomic sites, may involve any abdominal organ system, and have a number of different causes. The heterogeneity of the disease process and the varying capabilities of the different imaging techniques (with respect to site and organ system) make reliance on a single technique undesirable. An algorithmic approach using 67Ga or 111In-WBC scintigraphy, CT, and US provides a logical and clinically practical approach to complicated abdominal infection. By recognizing differences in clinical presentation and by appreciating the diagnostic strengths and weaknesses of nuclear medicine, CT, and US, the algorithm provides a reliable and direct route to accurate diagnosis while minimizing unnecessary examinations."
CD009185,0,3062783,0,The role of scintigraphy in urinary tract infection.,"There is controversy regarding the role of radiological imaging for urinary tract infection (UTI). The ""gold standard"" has been the intravenous pyelogram (IVP). Yet, the IVP has a very limited value with only about 25% of children with pyelonephritis demonstrating abnormalities. Ultrasound (US) has recently been advocated as a replacement for the poorly sensitive and poorly specific IVP. However, comparative studies between US and IVP indicate only an equivalent sensitivity and specificity. Cortical scintigraphy with Technetium-99m glucoheptonate (99mTc GH) or 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) has also been advocated as a means of differentiating parenchymal (pyelonephritis) from nonparenchymal (lower UTI) involvement in UTI. The clinical presentation may be misleading especially in the infant and child in whom an elevated temperature, flank pain, shaking chills, or an elevated sedimentation rate are often lacking. The clinician attempts to localize the site of infection for it has a direct bearing upon the therapy. A collecting system infection can often be eradicated with a single oral dose of an appropriate antibiotic, whereas renal parenchymal involvement requires IV therapy for an extended interval. Cortical scintigraphy can localize the site of infection with a high degree of accuracy. Recent studies report a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 81% of pyelonephritis. This is in contrast to the IVP with a sensitivity of only 24% and US with a sensitivity of only 42%. The scintigraphic appearance of parenchymal infection of the kidney is a spectrum of minimal to gross defects reflecting the degree of histologic involvement that spans from a mild infection to frank abscess. Cortical scintigraphy can be used to monitor the evolution of scarring following infection. Cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc DMSA or 99mTc GH is the method of choice for the initial evaluation of UTI. Not only does it have a very high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating parenchymal from collecting system disease, but it also provides an accurate quantitative measurement of function and in combination with radioiodinated orthoiodohippurate renography and Lasix (furosemide; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago) diuresis will also differentiate significant obstruction from stasis. The use of radionuclide techniques opens new vistas for the investigation of UTI. Cortical scintigraphy should become the gold standard by which other technologies, therapy, and theoretical considerations of pyelonephritis are measured."
CD009185,0,18696120,0,Unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney: single-center experience.,"Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is one of the most common renal abnormalities in children. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical course and outcome of patients with MCDK. Ninety pediatric patients with unilateral MCDK followed by the Pediatric Nephrology Department of Bakirkoy Maternity and Children's Hospital between 1990 and 2007 were included in this retrospective study. The dimercaptosuccinic acid radionuclide scan revealed no function in MCDK in all of our patients. Voiding cystourethrogram was performed in all patients. Twenty patients (22.2%) had abnormalities in the contralateral kidney. Nephrectomy was performed in 41 patients (45.5%). Twelve patients had undergone routine nephrectomy before 1996. Since then, patients have been followed up conservatively, and nephrectomy has been performed only when indicated. Indication of nephrectomy was arterial hypertension in 16 patients (23.1%), recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in 11 (15.9%), and severe abdominal pain in two (2.8%). Hypertension was noted within the first year of life in all patients except two. MCDK completely involuted in 39.3% within 48 months. There was no malignant transformation, proteinuria, or renal failure. In conclusion, hypertension is often noticed in infants with MCDK. Uninephrectomy leads to normalization. However, prospective studies are needed to exclude a spontaneous improvement of hypertension."

She presented with a pseudo-athletic appearance (Fig. 1) produced by an increase in the volume at the root of the upper limbs, upper back and the back of the neck (Fig. 2). The lesions produced a pulling sensation and were associated with paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and a moderate loss of strength in both arms. A biopsy taken from the upper third of the right arm showed a diffuse proliferation of the subcutaneous adipose tissue, which appeared normal, and extended between the collagen fibers, reaching in some cases into the most superficial zones of the reticular dermis (Fig. 3). Laboratory evaluation revealed a chronic anemia, leukopenia with moderate lymphopenia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevation of enzymes of hepatic function, decrease in total proteins, and increase in ferritin, all in the context of hepatopathy. Antinuclear antibodies and the hormonal profile were normal. Abdominal and gynecologic echography revealed a right ovarian cyst of no clinical relevance. Cranial nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed an increase in the periorbital fat responsible for bilateral exophthalmos."

CD009185,0,3227551,0,The diagnostic value of leukocyte indices and micro-erythrocyte sedimentation rate in neonatal infections.,"In an attempt to compare sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of newborn screening tests for sepsis, leukocyte indices derived from healthy African neonates, Manroe's published indices, micro-erythrocyte sedimentation rates (Mini-ESR) and a combination of the Mini-ESR and leukocyte indices of African neonates were applied to 32 infected infants and 20 uninfected neonates studied prospectively. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values derived from Manroe's indices were 93%, 35% and 69.8% respectively. The corresponding values derived from the indices of African neonates were 84.4%, 95% and 96.4%. Local reference values were thus more specific and predictive. Values obtained by combining Mini-ESR with indices of the African Neonates were 100%, 85% and 94%. The Mini-ESR alone yielded a sensitivity of 96.9%, specificity of 90% and a predictive value of 94%. The mini-ESR alone may therefore be a more valuable test in the sepsis screening of the African neonate."
CD009185,0,6395507,0,Value of determination of beta 2-microglobulin in toxic nephropathy and interstitial nephritis.,"Beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) is a low molecular weight protein of importance in the evaluation of the reabsorptive capacity of the proximal kidney tubule. This is based on the properties of beta 2-m: the daily production is constant and it leaves the body almost exclusively by glomerular filtration; 99.9% of the filtered amount is reabsorbed by the proximal tubule. The urinary excretion of beta 2-m is elevated (greater than 370 micrograms/day) in patients suffering from proximal tubular dysfunction with disturbance of tubular reabsorption. It is of great value as a marker of tubular involvement in toxic nephropathies, interstitial nephritis and the non-invasive method of choice to distinguish between renal and lower urinary tract infections."

CD009185,0,14870890,0,The significance of a defect on DMSA scan in children with renal transplants.,"Since December 1995, pediatric renal transplant recipients in our unit have received a DMSA scan as soon as possible post-transplant in order to provide a baseline for comparison in the event of subsequent complications. We retrospectively reviewed the case notes and DMSA scans of the 45 patients who underwent a scan within 9 wk of their transplant to see if pre or peri-transplant factors or post-transplant complications were associated with defects on scanning. Forty percentage of scans had defects. The presence of defects was not associated with potential predisposing factors such as patient or donor age, cadaveric or live donation, cold ischemia time, multiple donor vessels, the use of non-heart beating donors, the mean time to scan, the serum creatinine, or the presence of structural renal tract anomalies predisposing to UTI. However, 87% of patients had complications before the scan, including UTI, rejection, acute tubular necrosis, transplant biopsy and drug toxicity. Children with no clinical complications had a significantly reduced risk of a defect (p = 0.035), while biopsy was associated with the presence of defects (p = 0.0034). Twenty patients had one or more follow up DMSA scans: one patient developed a new focal defect. In conclusion, renal transplant defects are frequently found on DMSA scanning even early after transplantation and are non-specifically associated with many different complications."

CD009185,0,10544733,0,[Urinary lithotripsy in children. Multicenter study of the Pediatric Urology Study Group].,"The authors present the results of a survey conducted among French paediatric urologists belonging to the Groupe d'Etudes en Urologie Pédiatrique (GEUP) (Paediatric Urology Study Group). This study, based on 122 cases observed in 13 centres, is not exhaustive, but is nevertheless statistically significant. The preoperative assessment confirms the usual findings of urinary stones in children: pyelonephritis, haematuria and abdominal pain, the usual presenting complaint, concomitant malformative uropathy (10% of cases) and a predominance of calcium stones. More than 200 stones were treated, larger than 10 millimeters in diameter in one-third of cases. Renal stones, mainly caliceal (more than 50%), included 11 staghorn calculi. This study also included 22 ureteric stones, mainly in the pelvic ureter, and 2 bladder stones. Lithotripsy was ultrasound-guided in 2/3 of cases and required general anaesthesia in about 3/4 of cases. Ureteric catheterization was required in 19 infants preoperatively, but in only 2 infants (stein strasse) postoperatively. One or two lithotripsy sessions were sufficient in most cases, but 4 sessions were necessary in 5 patients, to the same kidney in 1 case. The mean hospital stay was 2 to 3 days, but the procedure was performed on an outpatient basis in 15 cases. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful and asymptomatic. This survey revealed about 10% of complete failures, corresponding to solitary caliceal stones in 2/3 of cases; 29 partial failures were essentially due to lower caliceal stones and staghorn calculi; 84 successes (stone-free), mainly pelvic or simple caliceal stones. Scintigraphy did not reveal any immediate postoperative impairment of renal function. This study reported a success rate of about 70%, regardless of the type of apparatus used. Assessment of the results of ESWL requires sufficient follow-up both concerning the outcome of fragmented stones and evaluation of possible functional repercussions. This survey defines the main indications: although ESWL can be applied to most stones, some stones constitute poor indications (cystine stones, stenotic malformative uropathy) or dubious indications: small lower caliceal stones, densely calcified staghorn calculi in older children. This study confirmed the efficacy and low morbidity of ESWL in children. A prospective study needs to be conducted according to a rigorous protocol in order to refine the technique and indications while reducing the possible long-term risks."
CD009185,0,9102939,0,[Detection of vesicoureteral reflux with radionuclide cystography].,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) an be detected by both X-ray and radionuclide cystography. The principal advantage of radionuclide method is considerably lower radiation dose used. 201 girls with urinary tract infection were evaluated for vesicoureteral reflux by direct radionuclide cystography (DRCG). VUR was detected in 60 children (30%). Comparative study between DRCG and voiding uretrocystography (VCUG) performed in 54 girls demonstrated no significant difference in sensitivity between these methods. Thus, DRCG could be recommended as alternative and complementary method to the conventional VCUG, for evaluation of VUR. Indications for application of radionuclide method are discussed."

CD009185,0,1433600,0,Fetal vesicoureteral reflux: outcome following conservative postnatal management.,"Of 222 infants with a urinary tract abnormality detected antenatally 30 male and 9 female patients (64 renal units) were found to have primary vesicoureteral reflux. Grade of reflux was predominantly severe, with grade III or higher noted in 83% of the patients. Prenatal and postnatal ultrasound failed to detect any abnormality in 29 refluxing units (45%) discovered contralateral to the known abnormal system, although 19 had grade III or higher reflux. Of the 64 refluxing units 8 underwent primary ureteral reimplantation, 12 were lost to followup and 44 were managed conservatively for a mean of 3.3 years. Reflux ceased in 61% of the cases, improved in 14% and remained unchanged in 23%. In only 1 unit did the grade of reflux increase. Documented urinary tract infection occurred in 6 of the 39 reflux patients. Dimercaptosuccinic acid renography performed in 21 infection-free patients demonstrated global reduction in renal parenchyma in 4 units, focal parenchymal defects in 3 and normal function in 14. Conservative postnatal management of fetal vesicoureteral reflux is justified. Global and focal parenchymal changes can occur in the kidneys of infants with reflux despite the absence of urinary tract infection."
CD009185,0,19334388,0,[Retrospective evaluation of 15 cases with psoas abscesses].,"Psoas abscesses are suppurative collections within the fascia surrounding the psoas and iliacus muscles. In this retrospective study it was aimed to evaluate the demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings and treatment outcomes of 15 psoas abscess cases admitted to Baskent University Hospital, Ankara, Turkey during June 2003-January 2008 period. The mean age of the patients was 55.8 years (range 18 to 70 years) with a female to male ratio of 5/10. Thirteen of the cases (86.5%) were admitted with the complaints of fever and back pain. Thirteen of the cases were diagnosed by abdominal computerized tomography while the other two by abdominal ultrasonography. One of the 15 patients was considered as primary psoas abscess, while the remaining 14 as secondary psoas abscess. The most common accompanying disease was diabetes mellitus (66.6%). Fourteen patients with secondary psoas abscess had vertebral osteomyelitis which was due to tuberculosis in five cases, to urinary tract infection in five cases, to pneumoniae in two cases, to surgical infection in one case and to brucellosis in one case. The cultivation of the abscess material from the 14 secondary psoas abscess cases revealed growth of bacteria in 11 of them (5 Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 1 Escherichia coli, 1 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 1 methicilin-resistant S. aureus, 1 Acinetobacter baumannii, 1 Brucella melitensis, 1 Serratia marcescens). The biochemical parameters of the cases (mean leukocyte counts: 14.500 cell/mm3; mean erythrocyte sedimentation rates: 78 mm/hour; mean C-reactive protein levels: 108 mg/dl) were also high. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage and received appropriate antibiotic treatment and the other two patients were treated with open surgical debridement. The duration of antimicrobial treatment was one year for M. tuberculosis cases and about 4-6 weeks in the others. One of the cases died due to complicating meningitis and sepsis. It is remarkable that in our series none of the psoas abscess cases were secondary to the diseases of the digestive tract unlike the series indicated in the literature. The isolation of M. tuberculosis as the causative agent in 5 (33.3%) cases emphasizes the fact that tuberculosis is still an important public health problem in Turkey."
CD009185,0,21520006,0,Probability of urinary tract infection in infants with ureteropelvic junction obstruction: is antibacterial prophylaxis really needed?,"In infants with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) is unknown, and there is a lack of prospective studies showing definitive evidence regarding the benefits and necessity of antibiotic prophylaxis. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of UTI in infants with UPJO and to determine whether the risk varies according to the degree of hydronephrosis. Infants with hydronephrosis detected prenatally or within the postnatal 28th day and who had no previous history of UTI were followed prospectively without antibacterial prophylaxis. Imaging studies were performed according to our Pediatric Uro-Nephrology Study Group protocol. Dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) scintigraphy was performed in all infants at the end of 1 year of follow-up. Eighty-four infants (56 boys, 28 girls) were included in the study. The distribution of patients in each hydronephrosis grading group was incidentally similar. Within a median follow-up period of 18 (12-24) months, none of the patients had UTI. Furthermore, no pyelonephritic scar was found on DMSA scans in any patient. We conclude that prophylactic antibiotic usage is not indicated in infants with UPJO, regardless of the severity of hydronephrosis, as the risk of UTI is minimal in this population."

Significant disorders of blood rheology: higher platelet ad red cell aggregation, lower erythrocyte osmotic resistance and increased blood viscosity were revealed in patients with pyoseptic urological diseases. In case plasmapheresis was included into the complex treatment, in line with the clinical efficacy of the latter a rapid normalization of the aforementioned parameters was documented by the 3-7th day of the treatment. Uroseptic patients who were exposed to plasmapheresis demonstrated improved microcirculation confirmed by isotope renography and Bengal rose which identified the improved performance of the kidneys and the liver. With account for the beneficial effect of plasmapheresis on hemorheological values in uroseptic patients, the authors suggested that for septic patients plasmapheresis substitution type should be changed."

CD009185,0,19649660,0,Early prediction of urinary tract infection with urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin.,"Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a protein identified in human neutrophil granules. The aim of the study was to assess whether urine level of NGAL (uNGAL) could represent a novel, reliable marker of urinary tract infection (UTI) and to determine the optimal cutoff level for uNGAL to predict UTI in children. Sixty patients with symptomatic UTI and 29 healthy controls were enrolled the study. Urine NGAL was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) radionuclide scan was performed within 7 days in the patients with UTI in an attempt to distinguish pyelonephritis from cystitis. Mean uNGAL level was significantly higher in the UTI group than in the controls (91.02 ng/ml vs 14.29 ng/ml, p = 0.0001) and using a cutoff 20 ng/ml for uNGAL for diagnosis of UTI, sensitivity, and specificity were 97% and 76%, respectively [area under the curve (AUC): 0.979]. Mean uNGAL/creatinine ratio (uNGAL/Cr) was also significantly higher in the UTI group [201.81 ng/mg creatinine (Cr) vs 18.08 ng/mg Cr; p = 0.0001], and using a cutoff 30 ng/mg Cr for uNGAL/Cr for diagnosis of UTI, sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 76%, respectively (AUC: 0.992). In conclusion, both uNGAL and uNGAL/Cr can be used as a novel, sensitive marker for early prediction of UTI in the absence of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, and the optimal cutoff value for prediction of UTI is lower than the values determined for acute kidney injury. Further investigations with larger patient groups are required to confirm our results."

CD009185,0,1576769,0,Urinary tract obstruction and infection in the neonate.,"Congenital urinary tract obstruction is a common cause of renal failure accounting for up to 20% of end-stage renal disease cases. Intrauterine obstruction often results in parenchymal loss and renal dysfunction. The pathophysiology of obstructive nephropathy and its further depression of renal function is related to severe renal vasoconstriction, which is in large part angiotensin mediated. Signs suggestive of urinary obstruction in the newborn may include an abdominal mass, hypertension, oligoanuria/polyuria, urosepsis, and hyperchloremic acidosis. The combination of renal ultrasound, diuretic renal scans, and voiding cystourethrogram are the main diagnostic modalities in infants with hydronephrosis. Nonsurgical management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction has become more popular, particularly in mild to moderate cases. Early fulguration or bypassing the obstruction of urethral valves is essential and a decrease in serum creatinine to below 1 mg/dL within 1 month of relief of obstruction is a favorable prognostic sign. Obstruction complicated by infection is dangerous and requires prompt intervention. Any newborn with a urinary tract infection, regardless of sex, should be presumed to have urinary obstruction or reflux until proven otherwise."

Using a sensitive method of sequential 111In-granulocyte scintigraphy, we recorded the speed of focal 111In-granulocyte accumulation in 70 patients with non-osseous inflammatory and infectious foci, with special reference to the influence exerted by the duration of disease, patient age, body temperature, antibiotic therapy and initial trapping of granulocytes in the lungs. About 50% of the images had turned positive at 30 min after injection. Except for patients with urinary tract infections, the age of the patient did not influence the speed of 111In-granulocyte accumulation; nor did the duration of disease, antibiotic therapy or degree of initial granulocyte hold-up in the lungs. High fever, on the other hand, presumably reflecting an intense inflammatory reaction, was associated with an accelerated focal 111In-granulocyte accumulation, indicating that properties of the inflammatory process per se are major determinants of the speed of accumulation of 111In-labelled granulocytes in inflammatory processes."

CRP was also determined in 66 women in uncomplicated labour at term (53 singleton and 13 twin pregnancies). The placenta was examined for histological evidence of infection in all patients who were delivered before 36 weeks (n = 21) and in all women in the control group (n = 66). Elevated CRP levels were more often found in patients who were refractory to tocolysis, suggesting an underlying infectious morbidity. Placental infection was found in 62% of the preterm delivery group and in 12% of the control group. There was an association between elevated CRP levels and histological evidence of placental infection. However, confounding factors such as urinary tract infections limit the usefulness of the CRP test. Because CRP cannot predict clinical perinatal infection accurately, its clinical relevance is very limited."
CD009185,0,2868520,1,Association of P and other fimbriae with clinical pyelonephritis in children.,"196 episodes of urinary tract infection in children were analysed. 74 were classified as pyelonephritic (PN), 61 as cystitis (C), and 61 as asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) on the basis of three clinical signs (elevated temperature, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and/or white blood cell count). The frequency of P-fimbriae was found high in PN (77%), and significantly lower in C (23%), ABU (20%) and among fecal strains (16%). The common, type 1 fimbriae were also more frequent in PN (92%) than in the other groups (84-76%), whereas other, so-called X-fimbriae, were relatively rare in all the patient groups (15-6%). P-fimbriation was not significantly associated with the presence or absence of reflux or obstructive anomalies. By contrast, the frequency of P-fimbriation increased with increasing severity of the clinical symptoms of pyelonephritis (95% in episodes of elevated temperature, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and white blood cell count)."

CD009185,0,17991370,0,[Recommended diagnostic imaging tests in urinary tract infections].,"The present article reviews the scientific evidence available on diagnostic imaging tests in urinary tract infections in childhood. There is sufficient information on the technical validity of the various imaging tests. Through calculating probabilities, this information can be used in the process of diagnostic decision making. Nevertheless, the diagnostic yield offered by these tests is unclear; some of the estimations of costs, efficacy and risks suggest that certain diagnoses have little clinical importance. The current strategy of routine use of imaging tests should probably be replaced by an individually-tailored approach, in which tests are indicated by taking into account the information available at each stage of the process, patients' and relatives' opinions, and clinicians' judgment on the probability of the diagnoses and the risks and benefits of each test."
CD009185,0,1507494,0,[Urinary trypsin inhibitor as an acute phase reactant].,"Early in this century, trypsin inhibiting activity has already been recognized in patients with acute infection or renal disease. In addition to these, conditions such as coronary thrombosis, surgical operation, artificial fever by heat-killed bacilli, malignancy, leukemia, later stage of normal pregnancy, etc. have been known to cause the elevated excretion of UTI in urine. Typically, maximal excretion of UTI has been observed within one or two days after the onset. It appears that recent studies have overcome the complexity of UTI molecule. Automated measurement of urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) in urine sample was carried out by either enzymic or immunologic method. UTI as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein enables us to monitor acute phase response, being confirmed in cases of abdominal surgery."
CD009185,0,484060,0,[Results of follow-up studies in children with megaureters].,"It is reported on the results of after-examinations in children with megaureters. The average interval between first operation and last after-examination is 8.1 years (1 to 14 years). Of altogether 63 children ten died, eight of their disease, including the postoperative complications. Eleven children were nephroureterectomized. In spite of the time of satisfying results concerning the renal function the prognosis is uncertain, particularly of the children with bilateral malformation. The number of the infections of the urinary tract is large and the deterioration of the function due to pyelonephritis is not to be foreseen. Changes or modifications of the operation technique and a strict dispensary care of the children let us hope for an improvement of the results during the next years."
CD009185,0,9181655,0,Aminoglycosides do not improve the efficacy of cephalosporins for treatment of acute pyelonephritis in women.,"A prospective, coordinated, randomized multicentre trial was conducted to determine whether tobramycin 160 mg intravenously (i.v.) once daily for 2 days would improve the efficacy of cefotaxime 1 g i.v. twice daily for 2 days followed by a 10-day course of oral cefadroxil 1 g twice daily, in the treatment of community-acquired acute pyelonephritis in women. Of 73 patients enrolled in the study, 51 could be evaluated according to the protocol. There were no significant differences in bacteriological cure rates between the combined treatment with tobramycin/cefotaxime and cefotaxime alone, either at short-term follow-up (63.0% vs 59.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) for difference in proportions -23.4% to 31.2%), or up to 7 weeks after cessation of treatment (42.9% vs 52.2%; 95% CI, -18.0% to 36.6%). A modified intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in clinical efficacy between the two regimens (68.6% vs 69.2%; 95% CI, -22.9% to 24.1%). Tobramycin seemed to enhance the resolution of inflammation by a more rapid decline in C-reactive protein levels. The high recurrence rates after treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics in this and previous studies of acute pyelonephritis may be explained by adverse ecological effects rather than failure to eradicate the infection."
CD009185,0,16791804,0,Results of a five-year study of 99mTc DMSA renal scintigraphy in children and adolescents following acute pyelonephritis.,"Renal scintigraphy, generally using 99mTc-DMSA, is the accepted reference standard for detection of renal cortical changes. The timing of the test, i.e., whether an acute 99mTc-DMSA scan, a follow-up only or both scans should be performed, however, remains open to discussion. In our study, a six-month follow- up DMSA scan was performed in all the children diagnosed with a first attack of acute pyelonephritis (APN) in two large paediatric clinics of Charles University's 3rd School of Medicine in Prague during a five-year period. All diagnoses were confirmed by a paediatric nephrologist."
CD009185,0,3725620,1,[Laboratory parameters as a guide for the radiologic study of infections of the urinary tract in childhood].,"Forty-nine children with urinary tract infection aged between 15 days and 10 years were studied. Thirty-three of them (67.3%) had urinary tract malformations. We valued the following parameters: a) White Blood Cells; b) Leukocyte differential; c) ESR at the first hour; d) CRP; e) Concentration ability; f) Body temperature. We wanted to investigate the usefulness of these parameters to predict which patients should be studied by X-ray of urinary tract. Single parameters did not prove very sensitive; the highest correlations were found with ESR and CRP, which were positive in 76% of the cases of malformations. Furthermore we valued the sensitivity and specificity of the tests grouped together: the highest values of sensitivity (97%) and specificity (31%) were obtained coupling the ESR and concentration ability."
CD009185,0,10025695,0,Heterotopic ossification in non-traumatic myelopathies.,"Heterotopic ossification (HO) is an important complication of spinal cord and brain injuries but is rarely reported among patients with non-traumatic myelopathies. In a prospective study on medical problems seven (6.04%) among the 114 subjects with non-traumatic myelopathies had heterotopic ossification. All of them had involvement of hip joints. The co-morbid conditions were: urinary tract infection, seven; spasticity, three; pressure sores, five; and deep venous thrombosis, one. The initial diagnosis was often other than heterotopic ossification. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated in all subjects. Following rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the range of motion improved in two patients. Heterotopic ossification can occur in patients with non-traumatic myelopathies and has risk factors and clinical features similar to patients with traumatic spinal cord injury. A high index of suspicion about this complication is necessary for early diagnosis and prompt intervention."
CD009185,0,8397439,0,[Imaging of acute pyelonephritis].,"Despite the advances achieved in imaging methods, the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis rests on clinical and bacteriological date. Yet imaging is of considerable value to exclude a possible obstacle in the excretory canals which might be responsible for acute pyelonephritis. Ultrasonography associated with plain abdominal radiography without preparation or with intravenous urography is the choice method. In case of atypical forms, patients at risks or resistance to medical treatment, computerized tomography provides an information that is invaluable for the diagnosis as well as for the prognosis."
CD009185,0,3544745,0,Imaging in acute renal infection in children.,"Infection is the most common disease of the urinary tract in children, and various imaging techniques have been used to verify its presence and location. On retrospective analysis, 50 consecutive children with documented upper urinary tract infection had abnormal findings on renal cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc-glucoheptonate. The infection involved the renal poles only in 38 and the poles plus other renal cortical areas in eight. Four had abnormalities that spared the poles. Renal sonograms were abnormal in 32 of 50 children. Excretory urograms were abnormal in six of 23 children in whom they were obtained. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 34 of 40 children in whom voiding cystourethrography was performed. These data show the high sensitivity of renal cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc-glucoheptonate in documenting upper urinary tract infection. The location of the abnormalities detected suggests that renal infections spread via an ascending mode and implies that intrarenal reflux is a major contributing factor."
CD009185,0,6624432,0,Micturition cystourethrography using X-ray or scintigraphy in children with reflux.,"Thirty children with first time urinary tract infection were investigated for vesicoureteral reflux after bladder catheterization. Micturition cystourethrography with X-ray was compared to scintigraphy because scintigraphy gives less than 10% radiation dose by fluoroscopy. Reflux to the renal pelvis was observed more frequently with scintigraphy, otherwise the nosographic sensitivity and the predictive value of a negative test were about the same (0.90). Scintigraphy is therefore recommended for routine control of reflux in children."
CD009185,0,12107804,1,Procalcitonin as a marker of acute pyelonephritis in infants and children.,"In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we measured serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels and compared these with other commonly used inflammatory markers. We evaluated the ability of serum PCT levels to predict renal involvement, as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte counts, and PCT levels were measured in 64 children admitted for suspected UTI. Renal parenchymal involvement was assessed by (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the first 7 days after admission. In acute pyelonephritis, the median PCT level was significantly higher than in the lower UTI group (3.41, range 0.36-12.4 microg/l vs. 0.13, range 0.02-2.15 microg/l, P<0.0001). In these two groups, respectively, median CRP levels were 120 (range 62-249 mg/l) and 74.5 (range 14.5-235 mg/l, P=0.012) and leukocyte counts were 15,910/mm(3) (range 10,200-26,900) and 14,600/mm(3) (range 8,190-26,470, P=0.34). For the prediction of acute pyelonephritis, the sensitivity and specificity of PCT were 94.1% and 89.7%, respectively; CRP had a sensitivity of 100%, but a specificity of 18.5%. We conclude that serum PCT may be an accurate marker for early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis."
CD009185,0,12380905,0,Acute pyelonephritis: analysis of 52 cases.,"Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a frequent disease, but diagnostic approach, evolution into abscesses, and indication to hospitalization are still open problems. We have made a retrospective analysis of APN cases observed in our hospital. We identified 58 patients (pt) and selected 52 of these who presented fever and loin pain at the onset (31 were hospitalized in Nephrology and 21 in other units). Urine culture was positive in 11/48 cases (22.9%), blood cultures in 3/26 cases (11.5%) (Escherichia coli). Renal sonography was normal in 20/48 cases (41.6%) and suggestive for APN in 23/48 cases (47.9%). CT with contrast medium was normal in 9/28 cases (32.1%) and positive in 19/28 cases (67.8%), with evidence of unique or multiple hypodense areas; abscesses were found in 8 patients (28.5%). No statistically significant differences were found between patients with positive or negative CT as regards fever, leukocytosis, ESR, CRP, CRP at 20 days, urinary leukocytes, urine culture, duration of symptoms before hospitalization. Moreover no differences were found between patients with and without abscesses. CT was performed more frequently among patients hospitalized in Nephrology than among patients hospitalized in other services (24/31-77.4%-vs. 4/21-19%-, p = 0.05). NMR was abnormal in 6/9 cases. A radiographic documentation of APN was obtained in 61.53% of patients with clinical diagnosis of APN. Of these, only 18.7% had positive urine culture. In conclusion, our data suggest that demonstration of urine infection is not necessary for APN diagnosis, when clinical and/or radiologic diagnosis of APN has been made. Evolution into abscesses is frequent and not easily susceptible on clinical ground; for this reason we think it is advisable to perform CT or NMR systematically. Differences in clinical behavior between different units suggest the need for diagnostic guidelines."

Among 109 children with bacteriuria, 70% had symptoms of lower urinary tract infection, 35% had vesicoureteric reflux, and 23% radiological evidence of pyelonephritis. Both pyuria and a past history of urinary infection were related to radiological evidence of reflux or pyelonephritis. Covert bacteriuria was found more frequently in children from social classes IV and V; and their housing, home circumstances, and home care were worse than a control group, even when allowance was made for their social class differences. The children appeared generally healthy but were smaller than a control group. The data suggest that the great majority of these children are not seriously at risk and that there is at present not sufficient evidence to warrant prescriptive screening."

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of urinary tract anomalies and acute renal damage in neonates who presented with first urinary tract infection in the first 8 weeks of life. We reviewed the records of 95 infants, who were hospitalised with UTI during a 6-year period (1994-1999). Patients with antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis and incomplete radiological investigations were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 57 patients, 42 were boys and 15 girls. The mean age at diagnosis was 32 days (range 5-60 days). All patients underwent renal ultrasonography (US), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Urinary tract abnormalities were detected in 20 (35%) patients. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was found in 19 (33%) neonates, 7 girls and 12 boys. Acute cortical defects on DMSA scan were present in 19 kidneys of patients with VUR and in 25 of those without reflux. Only one-third of neonates after first symptomatic UTI had VUR.

CD009185,0,12172760,0,ACE gene polymorphism and renal scar in children with acute pyelonephritis.,"The pathogenesis of renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children is multifactorial. In addition to well-known risk factors (young age, high grade of vesicoureteral reflux, P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, and treatment delay), a role for genetic predisposition has been suggested. Since the ACE gene deletion polymorphism is a known risk factor for progressive glomerulosclerosis in chronic renal diseases, we have investigated the relationship between the ACE genotypes and the development of renal scarring after APN. Fifty-nine children (43 males and 16 females) with APN diagnosed by urine culture and technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99)Tc-DMSA) renal scan were studied. ACE genotypes were determined as II, ID, and DD using the polymerase chain reaction technique. A follow-up (99)Tc-DMSA renal scan was performed to evaluate the development of renal scars 3-6 months after treatment. The distribution of ACE genotypes and the allele frequencies were compared in the renal scar-positive ( n=39) and -negative group ( n=20). ACE genotype frequency after stratification by risk factors was also evaluated. The distribution of ACE genotypes did not differ between the renal scar-positive (II 25.9%, ID 35.9%, DD 28.2%) and -negative group (II 35.0%, ID 45.0%, DD 20.0%), before and after stratification by each risk factor.

We classified surgical procedures into four categories by invasiveness and contamination levels: Category A; clean less invasive surgery, Category B; clean invasive or clean-contaminated surgery, Category C; surgery with urinary tract diversion using the intestine. Prophylactic antibiotics were administrated intravenously according to our protocol, such as Category A; first or second generation cephems or penicillins on the operative day only, Category B; first and second generation cephems or penicillins for 3 days, and Category C; first, second or third generation cephems or penicillins for 4 days. The wound conditions and general conditions were evaluated in terms of the surgical site infection (SSI) as well as remote infection (RI) up to postoperative day (POD) 30. The SSI rate highest (23.3%) for surgery with intestinal urinary diversion, followed by 10.0% for surgery for lower urinary tract, 8.9% for nephroureterctomy, and 6.0% for radical prostatectomy. The SSI rates in clean surgery including open and laparoscopic nephrectomy/adrenalectomy were 0.7 and 1.4%, respectively. In SSIs, gram-positive cocci such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (58.8%) or Enterobacter faecalis (26.5%) were the most common pathogen. Similarly, the RI rate was the highest (35.2%) for surgery using intestinal urinary diversion, followed by 16.7% for surgery for lower urinary tract, 11.4% for nephroureterctomy, and 7.6% for radical prostatectomy, while RI rates for clean surgery were less than 5%. RIs most frequently reported were urinary tract infections (2.6%) where Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.3%) and Enterobacter faecalis (15.3%) were the major causative microorganisms. Parameters such as age, obesity, nutritional status (low proteinemia), diabetes mellitus, lung disease, duration of operation, and blood loss volume were recognized as risk factors for SSI or RI in several operative procedures. Postoperative body temperatures, peripheral white blood counts, C reactive protein (CRP) levels in POD 3 were much higher than those in POD 2 in cases suffering from perioperative infections, especially suggesting that CRP could be a predictable marker for perioperative infections."

CD009185,0,1311185,0,Vesico-ureteric reflux in the damaged non-scarred kidney.,"Renal damage without scarring is a rare manifestation of reflux nephropathy, and is infrequently reported in the literature. A retrospective review of a large series of patients with urinary tract disorders at the hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, identified 12 patients with vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) with no evidence of scarring but with renal damage as assessed using technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scan. There were 9 simplex kidneys, the differential function was between 33% and 43% (mean 38%). On follow-up to date (mean 6.7 years) all kidneys show stable differential function with neither improvement nor deterioration. Only 8 children had a urinary tract infection. Renal damage without evidence of a focal scar associated with VUR may be a manifestation of growth arrest possibly due to glomerular damage. The sensitivity of 99mTc-DMSA may reveal the permanent nature of the renal damage."

From February 2009 to June 2010, 14 patients with prostate cancer recurrence after radiotherapy were selected for HIFU treatment; all patients had a positive TRUS-guided biopsy and the absence of distant metastases was confirmed by computer tomography, PET choline or bone scintigraphy. We classified all patients in 3 groups using D'Amico's classification: 4 patients high risk (PSA >20 ng/ml - 8≤ Gleason Score≤ 10 - clinical stage≥T2c), 8 patients intermediate risk (10 <PSA≤20 ng/ml - Gleason Score=7 - clinical stage=T2b), and 2 patients low risk (PSA≤10 ng/ml - Gleason Score≤6 - clinical stage=T1c-T2a). Progression was defined using Stuttgart definition (PSA>PSAnadir+1.2ng/ml) or after adjuvant therapy introduction. All complications were recorded. Of the 14 patients selected, 12 patients underwent HIFU treatments; 2 patients were excluded because of rectal strictures induced by radiotherapy. At a mean 13 months' follow-up, biochemical success rate was obtained in 1 of the high risk patients and in 5 of the low and intermediate risk patients; 1 man died for a disease not correlated with prostate cancer recurrence. Complications included urinary tract infection, acute urinary retentions, urethral strictures and light stress incontinence. In our experience salvage HIFU is a safe treatment option for local relapse after radiotherapy; its efficacy depends on a careful patient selection."

CD009185,0,22123565,0,[Use of procalcitonine in intensive care units: comparison of semi quantitative PCT-Q Brahms assay with automated PCT-Kryptor assay].,"Procalcitonine (PCT) is recognized as a major and specific biomarker in diagnosis of bacterial infection. Used early in sepsis, it allows immediate administration of antibiotics and monitoring its effectiveness. Confronted on systemic inflammation response syndrom (SIRS), physicians must react quickly and effectively to evaluate bacterial infection and sepsis. The objective of this study was to compare analytical and clinical performances of semi-quantitative PCT-Q assay (Brahms) with quantitative and automated assay such on Kryptor (Brahms). Fifty blood samples of intensive care patients were compared. The analytical performance observed with PCT-Q assay is accurate: linear ratio kappa of 0.912 (95% CI 0.61, 0.97) and a good correlation between these techniques (p < 0.0001) (MedCalc software) were observed. Three discordances were observed and confirm the difficulties of reading for values close to 0.5 ng/mL. For these patients, PCT result showed its interest to discriminate local infection of a sepsis, to stop antibiotherapy with broad spectrum and to consolidate a therapeutic effectiveness in multi-visceral failure context. The semi-quantitative assay seems adapted for a fast and reliable evaluation of PCT in a general-purpose laboratory, not requiring neither dedicated analyzer, nor complex technicality but a control of the visual evaluation of results. It could be used for diagnosis of sepsis without monitoring precisely therapeutic follow-up."

CD009185,0,2085989,0,Fosfomycin trometamol versus netilmicin in children's lower urinary tract infections.,"Fosfomycin trometamol (FT), an antibiotic active against the common urinary pathogens, may be demonstrated in adequate urine concentrations up to 36-48 h after a single oral dose of 1-2 g. This pharmacokinetic peculiarity seems to indicate that this antibiotic may be used in single doses in the therapy of lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in infants and children. The efficacy and safety of FT in single oral doses was compared with those of netilmicin (NM), an aminoglycoside antibiotic with a demonstrated efficacy in bolus doses against UTIs, shown in a multicentric study. One hundred and thirty-five children with lower UTI, diagnosed on the basis of fever (less than 38 degrees C), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (less than 25 mm/l h) and C-reactive protein (less than 20 micrograms/ml), were included in the study: 71 received 2 g of FT, 64 5 mg/kg of NM. Cure, defined as persistence of sterile urine up to 30 days after therapy, was reached in 80.2% of children in the FT group and in 81.2% of children in the NM group. Persistence of infection was demonstrated in 7 and in 3 children, respectively. Recurrence of infection was noticed in 7 patients in the FT group and in 9 in the NM group. No differences between FT- and NM-treated children are demonstrable even if the patient population is analyzed according to the higher risk of UTI because of the presence of an anatomical and/or functional abnormality of the urinary tract or due to a previous tendency to recurrent UTIs. FT is as effective as NM in the treatment of lower UTIs in infants and children."

CD009185,0,2557799,0,Serial 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans after urinary infections presenting before the age of 5 years.,"Forty five children presenting with a first proven urinary tract infection under the age of 5 years were studied by sequential 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans. Forty nine kidneys in 40 children had definite defects at presentation, and 39 (80%) of these defects were still present when the DMSA scan was repeated. Changes in the appearance of defects were independent of the presence or degree of reflux at presentation and of symptomatic recurrence of infection, though the combination of new infection and grade 3 reflux (reflux reaching the renal calices with distension) was associated with deterioration. No kidney with a relative DMSA uptake of less than 35% showed any improvement in its cortical defects. Only two kidneys that were initially without defects, in a single patient who had bilateral grade 3 reflux and breakthrough infections, developed defects on subsequent scans. The outcome after urinary tract infection is dependent on the effect of the first infection on the kidney. Occasionally children with grade 3 reflux develop damage during subsequent infections. More widespread use of DMSA scans should improve our understanding of the factors that determine the development of renal damage."

Radiologic (USG, DMSA, and VCUG), clinical (age, gender, peak fever, therapeutic delay time) and laboratory (CBC with differential count, ANC (absolute neutrophil count), BUN, Creatinine, urine analysis, gram stain, culture, CRP and ESR) variables were analysed. DMSA was performed within 5 days and after six months. VCUG was performed after acute phase of UTI. The differences in TDT according to the presence of ASL, USF and VUR were assessed. And the correlation between ASL or USF with the duration of TDT was assessed. Of 230 patients enrolled, 142 patients had refluxing UTI and 88 patients had non-refluxing UTI. TDT was the risk factor associated with ASL and USF along with presence of VUR. TDT was longer in ASL positive group compared with the ASL negative group. Also USF group showed longer TDT compared with those without USF in both refluxing UTI and non refluxing UTI. The TDT was significantly shorter in USF group with the presence of VUR. Positive linear association was noted between prevalence of ASL and USF and duration of TDT. In conclusion, the impact of UTI on formation of USF may be enhanced by the presence of VUR with shorter duration of TDT."

CD009185,0,1616829,0,Five-year study of medical or surgical treatment in children with severe reflux: radiological renal findings. The International Reflux Study in Children.,"The renal findings on intravenous urography (IVU) are reported in 306 children (73 boys, 233 girls) from eight European centres entered into an international study comparing medical and surgical management of children with urinary tract infection and severe vesico-ureteric reflux followed for 5 years. One hundred and fifty-five children were randomly allocated to medical and 151 to surgical treatment. Protocol and investigative techniques were standardised and randomisation, data collection and analysis were performed centrally in Essen, Germany. At entry 149 (49%) has established renal scarring (79 medical, 70 surgical). Children with normal kidneys (105), areas of thinned parenchyma (52) and grade of reflux were also evenly distributed. IVU was repeated at 6, 18 and 54 months and serial urine culture, 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans and plasma creatinine estimations were performed. Two hundred and seventy-two children (89%) completed this follow-up. In 174 children (57%), (90 medical, 84 surgical) there was renal growth without morphological change. New renal scars developed in 19 children treated medically and 20 surgically; 12 (5 medical, 7 surgical) developed in previously normal kidneys. Six followed post-operative obstruction. No significant difference in outcome was found between medical or surgical management in terms of the development of new renal lesions or the progression of established renal scars."
CD009185,0,15309597,0,Screening for vesicoureteral reflux and renal scars in siblings of children with known reflux.,"The incidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in the general population is less than 1%, but it is high in families with reflux. The reported prevalence of VUR among siblings of index patients with reflux has ranged from 4.7% to 51%. Reflux carries an increased risk of pyelonephritis and long-term renal impairment. The purpose of this study was to identify the age-related incidence and severity of reflux, and the frequency of associated renal parenchymal damage in siblings of children with reflux in order to assess the use of screening at different ages. Between October 1994 and February 2003, 40 siblings of 34 index patients were screened with direct voiding cystography. 99( m ) technetium (Tc)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) nuclear renal scans were performed in siblings with VUR to detect renal scarring. The cystograms were interpreted as showing the presence or absence of VUR and the DMSA scan as symmetrical or asymmetrical differential function, with or without renal scarring. Of 40 siblings, 17 had VUR, representing an incidence of 42.5%. The mean age at study entry of the 15 boys and 25 girls was 63 months (range 6 months to 12 years). The majority of siblings with abnormal DMSA scans were asymptomatic. Reflux was unilateral in 12 siblings and bilateral in 5. Of the 17 refluxing siblings (22 refluxing ureters), 7 (41.17%) had a history of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). The frequency of VUR was nearly equal in siblings over 6 years and those younger than 6 years. Of the 17 siblings with VUR, 16 had DMSA scintigraphy. Of these, 5 were normal and 11 (68.75%) showed abnormalities (7 asymmetrical differential function and 4 parenchymal defect), which was bilateral in 7 and unilateral in 4. In conclusion, this study confirms a significant overall incidence of VUR and renal parenchymal damage in the siblings of patients with known reflux. The prevalence of reflux in older siblings is similar to that in younger siblings. Our review suggests that all siblings over 6 years should undergo a screening cystogram, even in the absence of urinary tract infection. DMSA scintigraphy of asymptomatic siblings appears to be beneficial in preventing renal injury."
CD009185,0,8560356,0,[Unusual presentation of bilateral ureterocele in an adult Black male. Clinical case].,"Ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intra-bladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder. The abnormality leads to urinary retention and recurrent urinary tract infection which can cause irreversible damage to the kidney. Antenatal ultrasound diagnosis of ureterocele is possible but remains difficult. The disease is confirmed during radiologic examination after birth, and renal function is assessed by 99mTc-DMSA. Ureterocele, while not an uncommon pediatric urologic problem, has been reported only rarely in adults. It is bilateral in 10% of cases, is rare in black people, and requires thoughtful management decisions. A relatively uncommon case of bilateral ureterocele with single ureter, associated with left vesicoureteral reflux, in African black man is reported. The patient was investigated by ultrasonography and intravenous urography. Surgical transvesical right ""osteoplasty"" and excision of the left ureterocele plus ureteric reimplantation, using Politano-Leadbetter technique, were performed. The surgical approach to ureterocele is discussed and we underlined the difficulty of therapeutic decisions, especially if surgery is considered."

Diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) is usually based on clinical and biological data. The clinical usefulness of early Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy remains controversial, although it may influence the type and duration of treatment.

Evaluation of antibody-coated bacteria test and C-reactive protein assay as predictors of cure.,"The efficacy of single-dose (cefaclor, 2 g orally) and multidose (cefaclor, 250 mg orally three times a day for 10 days) antibiotic regimens in the therapy of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) in nonpregnant women were compared. The patient's clinical status and results of urine cultures were compared in retrospect with the results of the antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) test and C-reactive protein (CRP) test in order to determine if either test would predict the patient's response. Overall, 10 of 30 patients (33 percent) and 18 of 22 patients (81 percent) given single doses and multidoses, respectively, had negative urine cultures four weeks after completion of therapy. A negative urine culture at four weeks correlated with a negative ACB test utilizing the less inclusive criteria for negativity (less than 5 bacteria with fluorescence in 5 minutes of search) but not with a negative ACB test utilizing the more inclusive criteria (less than 10 percent bacteria with fluorescence) or with a negative CRP test. The cure rate in the ACB-negative single-dose group (7 of 9 patients) utilizing the less inclusive criteria for negativity was similar to the cure rate in the ACB-negative multidose group (8 of 10 patients). This study suggests that the ACB test, if properly standardized, might permit identification of a population of patients with UTI who would respond to single-dose cefaclor therapy."
CD009185,0,2371096,0,Urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and the selection of children for radiologic evaluation after urinary tract infection.,"Urinary levels of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) were measured in 147 consecutively enrolled children younger than 13 years of age with urinary tract infection to determine whether elevated levels were a predictor of urologic abnormalities. The children were classified as having cystitis if results of 0 or 1 of the following tests were positive and as having pyelonephritis if results of greater than or equal to 2 tests were positive: (1) temperature greater than 38 degrees C, (2) serum C-reactive protein greater than 1 mg/dL, (3) erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 25 mm/h, and (4) 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin-renal concentrating protein less than 810 mOsm/kg. Urinary NAG to creatinine ratios did not distinguish cases of cystitis from those of pyelonephritis. Urinary NAG was useful in identifying children with cystitis who had vesicoureteral reflux of grades II through V. Of 6 children with cystitis and vesicoureteral reflux, 5 had levels of NAG more than 1 SD above the mean, whereas of 75 children without vesicoureteral reflux, only 15 had such an elevation (P = .003). Of those children with a normal NAG level, 60 (98.4%) had normal radiologic evaluation results, and only 1 child (1.6%) had vesicoureteral reflux. Levels of NAG did not identify children with pyelonephritis who had vesicoureteral reflux. It is concluded that (1) urinary NAG is of no value in localizing the site of urinary tract infection, and (2) an NAG level within 1 SD of the mean in a child with cystitis indicates a low risk of urologic abnormalities, and radiologic evaluation may be omitted unless infection recurs."

CD009185,0,17347969,0,Urinary tract infection: one lingering effect of childhood kidney diseases--review of the literature.,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a possible warning sign of the presence of anomalies of the urinary tract. Following a UTI there is concern with recurrences which can contribute to scarring which may lead to hypertension, pregnancy-induced hypertension and even renal failure in later years. Prospective studies using 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) have shown that 30%-40% of children will have renal scarring after febrile UTI, regardless of the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Many studies have demonstrated that VUR is an important risk factor for renal scarring after UTI. Hypertension affects at least 10% of children with renal scarring, and in adults with reflux nephropathy (RN), the prevalence of hypertension is also much higher (38%-50%). UTI, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) or renal function deterioration alone or in some combination has been reported to be as high as 39% in women with renal scarring. RN is one of the important causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. Prevention of renal scar development should reduce the incidence of hypertension in patients as they age. The appropriate management of childhood UTI includes education of parents, patients and general physicians to be sure that everyone is aware of not only the current condition, but also the possibility of future UTI-related situations."

CD009185,0,3075148,0,Bilateral renal malakoplakia in infancy.,"Two male infants aged 6 months presented with Escherichia coli septicaemia and urinary tract infection. Despite seemingly appropriate antibiotic therapy, a swinging fever, painful enlargement of both kidneys, sterile leukocyturia and renal failure persisted. Excretory urography, ultrasound scan, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse infiltrative disease. 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid uptake was minimal, but a 67Ga-citrate scan showed striking diffuse uptake by both kidneys suggestive of inflammatory cell infiltration. Bilateral renal parenchymal malakoplakia was diagnosed on tissue examination. Bilateral parenchymal involvement of the kidneys by this chronic granulomatous disease has not previously been reported in infancy and is fatal if untreated. The lesion is believed infection-induced, due to defective bacterial activity of the macrophages, possibly related to an abnormally low cGMP/cAMP ratio. Treatment with intracellularly active trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, rifampicin and ascorbic acid resulted in complete recovery of the one infant so treated over a period of months."
CD009185,0,23086593,0,Can postpyelonephritic renal scarring be prevented?,"Pyelonephritis in childhood may, in the worst cases, lead to long-term cardiovascular morbidity due to tubulointerstitial renal scarring. Renal damage is the end result of an interplay between (1) urinary tract anatomy and function, (2) bacterial virulence factors, and (3) the host innate immune system, which on the one hand manages bacterial clearance, but on the other causes tubulointerstitial inflammation, which underlies the renal scarring. It is unclear how common postpyelonephritic scarring is, and how many of the ""scars"" in fact represent congenital renal hypoplasia. We do, however, know that some situations have an increased risk for scars, i.e., large renal-uptake defects on initial renal scintigraphy or pyelonephritis in young girls with dilating vesicoureteral reflux. It seems logical that antiinflammatory or antioxidant therapy given concomitantly with antibiotics should lower the risk of postpyelonephritic scarring. Animal studies give some support to this idea, but research on humans has been surprisingly scant. In this issue of Pediatric Nephrology, we publish a study that indicates that antioxidant therapy with vitamin A or E given to children with pyelonephritis may indeed lower the risk for renal scarring. This is a track that needs to be pursued further."

CD009185,0,7628142,0,Tc-99m DMSA SPECT imaging in patients with acute symptoms or history of UTI. Comparison with ultrasonography.,"Although planar cortical scintigraphy has been demonstrated to be a sensitive test for the detection of renal infection and scarring, one criticism has been radiation dose to the renal cortex. Recent studies of cortical SPECT suggest a sensitivity for detection of lesions equal to, or greater than, that of planar scans. The authors prospectively performed SPECT scans on 36 patients referred for recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) (11 of 36), or recent onset of symptoms of UTI (25/36) after 30-40% of the standard 130 MBq (3.5 mCi) adult dose of Tc-99m DMSA was administered. Comparison was made with ultrasonography (US) performed at, or near, the same time. Of 67 kidneys evaluated, 34 (51%) demonstrated focal cortical loss on Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy, 1 kidney was small in size, and 32 kidneys were normal. Abnormalities were noticed in only 13 (19%) of kidneys on US. Previously, US has been the primary imaging modality in the evaluation of the young patient with UTI. Triple-headed Tc-99m DMSA SPECT scintigraphy is a more sensitive, low-dose (12 mGy, 1.2 r) method of detecting renal cortical abnormalities. As such, it is a more appropriate test for identifying sites of cortical infection and scarring and for following patients on prophylactic therapy for evidence of asymptomatic break-through infections."

The distinction between upper and lower tract UTI is clinically difficult but important, as permanent renal damage can occur when the UTI involves the kidneys. Children with a history of UTI need investigated promptly and thoroughly.

CD009185,0,18197421,0,Role of the Teflon deposit in the recurrence of vesicoureteral reflux.,"A relationship between the Teflon deposit, visible with ultrasound, and long-term success of subureteric Teflon injection (STING) treatment was investigated. The study included only those patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), in whom the reflux had disappeared and the Teflon deposits were visible 6 weeks following STING treatment. Cessation of VUR was proven by voiding cysto-urethrography (VCUG) in 99 patients (143 ureters). Average follow-up time was 9 (4-12) years. Patients were divided into two groups: group I, deposits visible with ultrasound [deposit (+)], and group II, no visible deposits at the end of the follow-up period [deposit (-)]. Reflux recurrence, the occurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and pyelonephritis were investigated, and technetium scintigraphy scans were examined. The deposit (+) group included 43 patients (65 ureters), and the deposit (-) group contained 56 patients (78 ureters). In the deposit (+) group there were no recurrences of VUR; however, 17 recurrences were found in the deposit (-) group (P < 0.05). Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy scans and occurrence of UTI showed significant difference between the groups (P < 0.05). A close relationship was found between the disappearance of the Teflon deposit and the recurrence of VUR. Disappearance of the Teflon deposit and repeated bacteriuria is a warning sign of the recurrence of VUR; therefore, VCUG might be warranted for these patients."
CD009185,0,11106046,0,Potential role of colour-Doppler cystosonography with echocontrast in the screening and follow-up of vesicoureteral reflux.,"Primary vesicoureteral reflux is a predisposing factor for urinary tract infections in children. The first-choice technique for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux is voiding cystourethrography, followed by cystoscintigraphy; cystoscintigraphy, however, has the advantage of only minor irradiation of the patient, but it does not allow the morphological evaluation of bladder and vesicoureteral reflux grading. Colour-Doppler cystosonography with echocontrast is a recently introduced method for imaging vesicoureteral reflux. The aim of our study is to evaluate the role of colour-Doppler cystosonography with echocontrast in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. Twenty children (11M, 9F) aged between 0.4 and 4.9 y underwent colour-Doppler cystosonography using a diluted solution of Levovist (Schering, Germany), after filling up the bladder with saline. In all patients, vesicoureteral reflux diagnosis and grading had been performed previously by voiding cystourethrography within 5 d from ultrasonography. Our data showed high accuracy in the detection of medium to severe vesicoureteral reflux (grades III-V), confirmed by radiological features in 9/9 patients. Conversely, in the 11 patients with mild vesicoureteral reflux (grades I-II), this technique showed extremely low sensitivity, allowing diagnosis in only four cases."
CD009185,0,8669103,0,Serum C-reactive protein. A useful and economical marker of immune activation in renal transplantation.,"This study investigated whether serial daily measurements of serum C-reactive protein (sCRP) in 187 renal allograft recipients could help discriminate episodes of renal dysfunction due to rejection or cyclosporine (CsA) nephrotoxicity and help adjust immunosuppression in the early posttransplant period. Excellent primary graft function was associated with an initial peak of sCRP on day 2 after transplant (median, 29 microg/ml; range, 4 to >200 microg/ml) with a return to <20 microg/ml in all patients by day 5 (median, 7 microg/ml; range, 2-19 microg/ml). Stable graft function (mean creatinine, 155 microg/ml) was accompanied by a median sCRP of 4 microg/ml (range, 1-19 microg/ml). In 30 episodes of rejection responsive to methylprednisolone, sCRP was initially significantly raised to a median of 49 microg/ml (P<0.001) but fell rapidly in response to treatment to a median of 11 microg/ml and continued to fall. In 19 episodes of rejection unresponsive to methylprednisolone, median initial sCRP levels were significantly higher (P<0.001) at 119 microg/ml and were still at a median of 77 microg/ml at the end of the treatment. Twenty-four patients in whom renal dysfunction was associated with CsA nephrotoxicity showed no increase in sCRP concentrations; median sCRP concentrations remained at <5 microg/ml throughout the episodes. A similar pattern was seen in patients with acute tubular necrosis. Serial sCRP measurements provide economical and reproducible evidence of immune activation, help discriminate renal dysfunction due to CsA nephrotoxicity or rejection, and allow appropriate modification of immunosuppressive therapy."

CD009185,0,19233952,0,Characterization of a beta-glucoside operon (bgc) prevalent in septicemic and uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains.,"Escherichia coli strains, in general, do not ferment cellobiose and aryl-beta-D-glucosidic sugars, although ""cryptic"" beta-d-glucoside systems have been characterized. Here we describe an additional cryptic operon (bgc) for the utilization of cellobiose and the aryl-beta-d-glucosides arbutin and salicin at low temperature. The bgc operon was identified by the characterization of beta-glucoside-positive mutants of an E. coli septicemia strain (i484) in which the well-studied bgl (aryl-beta-d-glucoside) operon was deleted. These bgc* mutants appeared after 5 days of incubation on salicin indicator plates at 28 degrees C. The bgc operon codes for proteins homologous to beta-glucoside/cellobiose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransfer system permease subunits IIB (BgcE), IIC (BgcF), and IIA (BgcI); a porin (BgcH); and a phospho-beta-D-glucosidase (BgcA). Next to the bgc operon maps the divergent bgcR gene, which encodes a GntR-type transcriptional regulator. Expression of the bgc operon is dependent on the cyclic-AMP-dependent regulator protein CRP and positively controlled by BgcR. In the bgc* mutants, a single nucleotide exchange enhances the activity of the bgc promoter, rendering it BgcR independent. Typing of a representative collection of E. coli demonstrated the prevalence of bgc in strains of phylogenetic group B2, representing mainly extraintestinal pathogens, while it is rare among commensal E. coli strains. The bgc locus is also present in the closely related species Escherichia albertii. Further, bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that homologs of the bgc genes exist in the enterobacterial Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter spp. and also in gram-positive bacteria, indicative of horizontal gene transfer events."
CD009185,0,21672365,0,The necessity of voiding cystourethrography in children with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis.,"The postnatal persistence of fetal hydronephrosis requires further evaluation to establish whether pathological abnormalities are present. This study determined the necessity for voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) to identify vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children (n = 195) with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis. Among the study population, the prevalence of VUR was 17.4% (24 males, 10 females). There was a poor correlation between the severity of hydronephrosis, ureteral dilatation, presence of bilateral hydronephrosis and presence of VUR. Except for the frequency of urinary tract infections and the presence of renal damage on (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans, VCUG was the only reliable method for confirming VUR in this study. The diagnosis of VUR is important for the early detection of renal damage. Further information is needed to develop the optimal approach to the evaluation of prenatal hydronephrosis, with reliable parameters that avoid invasive procedures such as VCUG."
CD009185,0,11529382,0,Oral ceftibuten switch therapy for acute pyelonephritis in children.,"The available oral third generation of cephalosporin, ""ceftibuten"" was used to substitute the intravenous drug after defervescence in acute pyelonephritis in children. This randomized controlled study compared the efficacy of an oral ceftibuten switch therapy with a ceftriaxone in both short-term and long-term outcomes. 36 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan proved pyelonephritis patients were randomized into the study group, ""ceftibuten"" (N=18) and the control group, ""ceftriaxone"" (N=18). Ceftriaxone (75 mg/kg/day) was the initial antibiotic in both groups. After defervescence for 24-48 hours, oral ceftibuten (9 mg/kg/day) was substituted in the study group and continued for 10 days. The subject characteristics and laboratory data were not different between the two groups. The urine culture at D14 was sterilized in both groups. The incidence of renal scarring was 66.6 per cent and 61.1 per cent in the study group and the control group respectively. The rate of recurrent infection showed no statistical significance. The duration of hospitalization was shorter in the study group than in the control. In conclusion, oral ceftibuten switch therapy can be recommended as a safe and effective treatment for acute pyelonephritis in children. The use of oral therapy may result in a significant reduction of health care expenditure."
CD009185,0,1331546,0,Evaluation of acute urinary tract infection in children by dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy: a prospective study.,"A prospective study examining the incidence of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) abnormalities in children at the time of acute urinary tract infection, the progression of these abnormalities following treatment and their correlation with the presence of vesicoureteral reflux is reported. DMSA scans performed within 72 hours of presentation in 65 previously healthy children with acute urinary tract infection were abnormal in 34 (52%). The scan appearances of 30 of 36 (83%) initially abnormal kidneys improved or became normal on the repeat DMSA study performed at 3 to 6 months after the acute urinary tract infection. A cystogram demonstrated significant vesicoureteral reflux in 11 of 45 cases (24%). Of these 11 cases 10 had abnormal DMSA studies and 1 had dilated upper tracts on ultrasound. Several conclusions may be drawn from our study. The incidence of DMSA abnormalities at the time of acute urinary tract infection is high but these abnormalities tend to resolve with time. An abnormal DMSA study at the time of urinary tract infection identifies most children with significant vesicoureteral reflux, and in our series a combination of ultrasound and DMSA identified all cases. This study may have major implications for the clinical investigation of children with urinary tract infection."
CD009185,0,1314912,0,Renal scarring following reflux and nonreflux pyelonephritis in children: evaluation with 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy.,"99mTechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is the imaging modality of choice for the detection of acute pyelonephritis and chronic renal scarring in children. Using the DMSA scan we prospectively evaluated renal scarring after reflux and nonreflux pyelonephritis in children. The study population consisted of 33 patients with acute pyelonephritis documented by a DMSA renal scan at infection. The children were evaluated for renal scarring with a followup DMSA scan 4 to 42 months (mean 10.7 months) after the acute infection. All new scarring on followup DMSA scans occurred at sites corresponding exactly to areas of acute inflammation on the initial DMSA scan. Therefore, only those kidneys with acute changes on the initial scan were subsequently analyzed. Of 38 kidneys new or progressive scarring developed in 16 (42%), including 6 of 15 (40%) with associated vesicoureteral reflux and 10 of 23 (43%) without demonstrable reflux. New renal scarring developed in 6 of the 7 kidneys (86%) associated with a neuropathic bladder or posterior urethral valves. In contrast, new scarring developed in only 10 of 31 kidneys (32%) associated with a normal bladder (p = 0.028). Excluding the kidneys associated with a neuropathic bladder or posterior urethral valves, new renal scarring developed in 3 of 12 (25%) with primary reflux, compared with 7 of 19 (37%) without vesicoureteral reflux. Except for the white blood count and the species of infecting bacteria, no other statistically significant differences could be found between those cases in which scars did or did not develop. We conclude that acquired renal scarring only occurs at sites corresponding to previous areas of acute pyelonephritis, the acute parenchymal inflammatory changes of acute pyelonephritis are reversible and do not lead to new renal scarring in the majority of cases, and once acute pyelonephritis has occurred ultimate renal scarring is independent of the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux."
CD009185,0,1331545,0,Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy for the evaluation of pyelonephritis and scarring: a review of experimental and clinical studies.,"Renal cortical scintigraphy has been reported to be useful in children for confirmation of the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Subsequent experimental studies have demonstrated that dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, when compared directly with histopathology, is highly reliable for the detection and localization of parenchymal inflammatory changes associated with acute pyelonephritis. Recent clinical studies of acute pyelonephritis using DMSA scintigraphy reveal that the majority (50 to 91%) of children with febrile urinary tract infections have abnormal DMSA renal scan findings and that the majority of these children do not have demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux. However, when vesicoureteral reflux is present, renal cortical abnormalities are demonstrated by DMSA scintigraphy in 79 to 86% of the kidneys. In children with febrile urinary tract infections routine clinical and laboratory parameters are not reliable in the differentiation of acute pyelonephritis, documented by DMSA renal scan findings, from urinary tract infections without parenchymal involvement. Furthermore, the presence of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli associated with febrile urinary tract infections does not reliably predict those kidneys that have acute parenchymal inflammation demonstrated by DMSA renal scans. DMSA is also the isotope agent of choice for the detection of renal scarring. Clinical studies report greater sensitivity of DMSA renal scintigraphy for the detection of renal scarring when compared with the excretory urogram, particularly in infants and young children. In a recent prospective study of post-pyelonephritic renal scarring in children we found that acquired renal scarring only occurs in sites corresponding exactly to previous areas of acute pyelonephritis demonstrated by DMSA scintigraphy at the time of infection. Furthermore, once acute pyelonephritis occurs, ultimate renal scarring is independent of the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux. These findings provide convincing evidence that renal parenchymal infection, rather than vesicoureteral reflux, is the prerequisite for acquired (postnatal) renal scarring. Vesicoureteral reflux as a risk factor for acquired renal scarring is directly related to its role as a risk factor for acute pyelonephritis. We conclude that DMSA scintigraphy is a valid tool for confirming the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children and for identifying kidneys at risk for subsequent renal scarring."

Urinary NAG activity was determined in 13 patients with various rheumatic diseases during administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), aminoglycosides, gold salts, cyclosporin and steroids. The significant decrease of urinary NAG activity was common in patients with recently diagnosed rheumatic diseases, who received steroids. The decrease of NAG enzymuria was correlated with biochemical indices of inflammation like ESR or hemoglobin. The use of two types of potentially nephrotoxic drugs, like NSAID and gentamicin or NSAID with cyclosporin induced significant augmentation of NAG excretion. This occurrence may precede azotemia. The recognition of high NAG enzymuria permits to reduce dosage or discontinue treatment with potentially nephrotoxic drug prior to irreversible renal insufficiency as shown in the case of a patient with psoriatic arthritis treated with simultaneously administered cyclosporin and diclofenac."

Total 110 patients of SSA were studied between July 2004 to June 2005. Routine haematological and immunological test were done by standard method. Total positivity of B27 in SSA was 43.63%, HLA B27 positivity was higher in children (68.75%). Sex wise analysis of B27 positive cases showed that 81.81% B27 positive patients were males. In HLA B27 positive cases lower spine, hip, sacroiliac, shoulder and knee joints were more involved (77.08%, 79.16%, 79.16%, 37.50% and 50.00% respectively). Urinary tract infection (UTI), diarrhoea and constipation were more common in B27 positive cases. Leukocytosis of neutrophilic type (33.33%), raised ESR (77.55%)., CRP positivity (63.63%) and anaemia (65.00%) were seen more frequently in B27 positive cases. In bilateral sacroiliitis diagnosed by X-ray, only 69.23% patient were B27 positive. Our study concludes that HLA B 27 positivity is higher in SSA seen in childhood and in young adult males. B27 positive patients have more severe disease and systemic manifestation Hence, male patients specially young adolescent or young adults with sacroileitis must be subjected for B27 typing."

Children aged 7 days to 36 months admitted for first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) to a pediatric emergency department were prospectively enrolled. The PCT concentration was determined at admission. Acute (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was performed within 7 days of admission and repeated 12 months later when abnormal findings were obtained on the first scan. Of the 72 children enrolled in the study, 52 showed signs of acute pyelonephritis (APN) on the first DMSA scan. A follow-up scintigraphy at the 12-month follow-up performed on 41 patients revealed that 14 (34%) patients had developed renal scars; these patients also presented significantly higher PCT values than those without permanent renal lesions [2.3 (interquartile range 1-11.6) vs. 0.5 (0.2-1.4) ng/mL; p = 0.007]. A comparison of the PCT concentration in patients with febrile UTI without renal involvement, with APN without scar development and with APN with subsequent renal scarring revealed a significant increasing trend (p = 0.006, Kruskal-Wallis test). The area under the ROC curve for scar prediction was 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.61-0.85), with an optimum statistical cut-off value of 1 ng/mL (sensitivity 78.6%; specificity 63.8%). Based on these results, we suggest that serum PCT concentration at admission is a useful predictive tool of renal scarring in infants and young children with acute pyelonephritis."

CD009185,0,3001474,0,[Radionuclide diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis].,"Nephroscintigraphy using a 67Ga-citrate complex and 99mTc-pyrophosphate was performed in 88 patients with acute pyelonephritis. Nuclide hyperfixation was revealed in 97.8% of the cases. Three groups of patients were singled out on the basis of the intensity of incorporation and nature of the distribution of the radiopharmaceuticals (RP) in the kidneys. In the 1st group the RP incorporation was insignificant but higher than normal values; the RP distribution in the affected kidney was diffuse-inhomogenous. These changes were considered to be typical of acute serous pyelonephritis. In the 2nd and 3rd groups a sharp rise of the RP accumulation was noted, being typical of acute purulent pyelonephritis. One could distinguish between diffuse and focal lesions by the picture of the RP distribution in the renal parenchyma. Diuresis stimulation made it possible to differentiate an actual nuclide fixation during inflammation from nuclide mechanical retention as a result of urine outflow disorder. According to the authors, both radiopharmaceuticals could be applied for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis as well as for differential diagnosis of various forms of the disease."

Concrements (0.5-2.0 cm and larger) located in the caliceal-pelvic segment, ureter, 12 patients had bilateral urolithiasis. Ineffective extracorporeal lithotripsy (ELT) was followed by ureteropyeloscopy in 86 (71%) cases. Rigid and fibroureteropyeloscopes were used. Due to ureterolithotripsy and lithoextraction, concrements were removed completely in 98 (80.9%) patients including 5 children with ligature concrements and 11 children with ureteral strictures which required additional endoureterotomy and removal of ligature. In 23 (18%) cases when migration of concrements and their fragments did not allow complete elimination of the concrements, the kidney in ureteropyeloscopy was drained by catheters or stents with further ELT. Postoperative exacerbation of pyelonephritis treated conservatively was registered in 20 (16.5%) children. Long-term complications were not seen. Thus, transurethral uretheropyeloscopy with lithotripsy and lithoextraction is highly effective, low invasive, safe treatment of urolithiasis in children in failure of ELT."

Medical records of 103 male and 83 female infants with mean age at entry 5.97 months were reviewed. Diagnosis was established using radiographic voiding cystourethrogram. At diagnosis, a renal ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy were performed in all children. The follow-up included blood pressure measurements, serial urine cultures, haematological and biochemical tests, radionuclide cystography, renal ultrasounds and renal scintigraphy. The majority of infants with reflux, 176/186, presented with one or more episodes of urinary tract infections. In 113 children, reflux resolved spontaneously, 27 underwent surgical or endoscopic correction and 46 are being followed-up to date. Spontaneous resolution after prophylaxis was more frequent in boys (p < 0.0001), in children with grade I or II (p < 0.0001) and unilateral reflux at diagnosis (p = 0.0215). No significant difference could be established with respect to the presence of scars (p = 0.1680) and the number of breakthrough urinary tract infections (p = 0.1078). The data of the present study indicate that spontaneous resolution rate is high in infants, and therefore, early antireflux"
CD009185,0,10616861,0,Increased levels of C-reactive protein in noncontrolled type II diabetic subjects.,"Type II diabetes is an hemorheological disease in which hyperglycemia increases the shear stress contributing to inflammation and dysfunction of endothelium. The purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between serum C-reactive protein and glucose levels in noncontrolled type II diabetic subjects. A cross-sectional study was conducted, including 62 noncontrolled type II diabetic subjects that were assigned to two groups. One group was patients with acute diarrhea or urinary tract infection and the other group was diabetic subjects who were infectious-disease free. Sixty-two subjects without diabetes constituted the respective control groups. Heart failure, other acute febrile illnesses, asymptomatic infection, renal, hepatic, malignant or chronic inflammatory illness, and macrovascular disease were considered as exclusion criteria. Laboratory measurements were performed. Thirty (96.7%) and 29 (93.5%) diabetic patients in the groups with and without infectious disease, and 28 (90.3%) control subjects with infectious disease had elevated C-reactive protein levels (> or =10 mg/L). In contrast, healthy control subjects did not have elevated serum C-reactive protein levels. Multiple regression analysis showed a significant association between C-reactive protein levels and hyperglycemia (Odds ratio = 7.4; IC95% 2.3-11.2). This study show that hyperglycemia is a related factor to the increase of serum CRP levels in noncontrolled type II diabetic subjects."
CD009185,0,10916126,0,Adolescent urinary tract infections.,"Urinary symptoms in adolescents are common, particularly in females. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) cause many of these symptoms. For uncomplicated UTIs, both lower and upper tract, therapy is straightforward. Commonly used antibiotics are trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), cefixime, and ciprofloxacin (off-label use) for 3 days for lower tract infections and 10ñ14 days for upper tract infections. Adolescent UTIs are markers for sexual activity, just as UTIs in younger children are often markers for anatomic defects, e.g., congenital abnormalities. Adolescents with upper and lower UTIs often have concurrent sexual activity or a complication of that activity. Issues among adolescents with UTIs are more similar to those of young adults than to those of younger children. It is as important to counsel adolescents about sexual activity and its consequences as it is to treat the UTIs. All adolescents with UTIs should be queried for sexual activity; evidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) should be sought; and counseling for STDs and responsible sexual activity is recommended. Complicated UTIs include those in patients who have grown into adolescence after a childhood of infections or who have anatomic abnormalities, recurrent infections, reflux and reflux nephropathy, spina bifida and neurogenic bladder, transplanted kidneys, diabetes, and urolithiasis. These patients require individualized medical programs, unique for their condition, history, and microbiology."

The purpose of the present study is to measure the change of UTI after surgery for gastric cancer and to compare with other acute phase reactants. Urine samples were collected from 7 surgical patients. UTI level was measured by radioimmunoassay and corrected by urinary level of creatinine. UTI levels began to increase from the first postoperative day and reached the maximum level on the third postoperative day. The pattern of UTI correlated with that of serum CRP levels. Meanwhile, when patient was in inflammatory condition postoperatively, UTI increased further and its pattern correlated with that of serum CRP levels. These results suggest that UTI is an acute phase reactant and a sensitive marker indicating the degree of inflammatory condition after surgery."

We present a case of malakoplakia affecting renal parenchyma. A 46-year-old woman with pyrexia and jaundice was referred to our department. Abdominal enhanced CT scan revealed a left pyelonephritis with ureteral stone and bilateral renal abscesses. Despite the insertion of a left ureteral stent and administration of antibiotics, the patient showed persistent high fever and elevated CRP, and no obvious improvement in clinical and imaging data. In view of the limited effectiveness of the conservative treatment in this case, we decided to perform left nephrectomy. The diagnosis of malakoplakia was made based on the histopathological findings of von Hansemann cells and Michaelis-Guttmann bodies detected in the nephrectomy specimen. She is clinically healthy up to the present (50 months after surgery) with normal clinical indicators and CT findings."

Unlike most other imaging techniques, radionuclide scanning is not affected by bowel gas or bony structures overlying the kidneys. This makes it particularly useful in children. Furthermore, renal scarring can be demonstrated by 99mTc-DMSA even before the classic gross anatomic and radiologic changes are present. The use of 99mTc-DMSA scanning in over 300 children has demonstrated its benefits and advantages over standard radiographic techniques."
CD009185,0,12578155,0,Transient hypophosphataemia associated with acute infectious disease in paediatric patients.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hypophosphataemia in children with acute infection and the relationship between serum phosphate and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration. Serum phosphate and CRP levels were measured on admission in 238 patients (aged 1 month to 14 y) with: pneumonia (n = 51), upper respiratory tract-related bacterial infection (n = 70), urinary tract infection (n = 50) and viral infection (n = 67). Patients were classified according to CRP value (0-50, 51-100, 101-150, > or = 151 mg/l) and type of infection. The prevalence of hypophosphataemia was calculated for each group. 30 children with hypophosphataemia on admission had serial measurements of serum phosphate and CRP levels. A significant negative correlation between serum phosphate and CRP levels was found (r = -0.41, p < 0.0001). Patients with CRP > or = 151 mg/l on admission had a lower mean serum phosphate value than those with CRP < or = 50 mg/l (1.17 vs 1.50 mmol/l, p < 0.0001). The overall prevalence of hypophosphataemia for patients with pneumonia, upper respiratory tract bacterial infection, urinary tract and viral infections was 45%, 35.7%, 18% and 4.4%, respectively. Hypophosphataemia occurred during the phase of rising of CRP level and resolved soon after CRP reached a plateau. In conclusion, hypophosphataemia is a relatively frequent but transient phenomenon in children with acute infectious disease. It is associated with an increase in CRP concentration and resolves before the normalization of CRP levels."

In 29 animals VUR was unilateral and in four bilateral, a total of 37 refluxing systems. Animals were killed either at varying intervals after a scintigraphic defect was noted (24 refluxing kidneys) or after a period when sequential scintigrams were normal (13 refluxing kidneys). The appearance of the scintigram acquired on the day prior to death was compared with the renal pathology, each kidney and renal image being divided into three zones (upper, middle, lower) for separate consideration. Of the 37 refluxing systems pyelonephritic lesions were seen in 27, in a total of 61 zones. In the remaining ten kidneys no scintigraphic defect was detected and no pathological lesions were identified either macroscopically or microscopically. Where an abnormality was detected on the scintigram a lesion was always identified in the kidney (sensitivity 100%). Small pyelonephritic lesions in a total of 12 zones in six kidneys were not detected on the scintigram (specificity 82%). Of the lesions undetected by scintigraphy only one occurred in the upper pole."
CD009185,0,17216249,0,Imaging strategies for vesicoureteral reflux diagnosis.,"The prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), although reported to be low in the general population, is high in children with urinary tract infection (UTI), first degree relatives of patients with known VUR and children with antenatal hydronephrosis. In addition, it has been shown that VUR and UTIs are associated with renal scarring, predisposing to serious long-term complications, i.e., hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency and complications of pregnancy. Therefore, diagnostic imaging for the detection of VUR in the high-risk groups of children has been a standard practice. However, none of these associations has been validated with controlled studies, and recently the value of identifying VUR after a symptomatic UTI has been questioned. In addition, several studies have shown that renal damage may occur in the absence of VUR. On the other hand, some patients, mainly males, may have primary renal damage, associated with high-grade VUR, without UTI. Recently, increasing skepticism has been noted concerning how and for whom it is important to investigate for VUR. It has been suggested that the absence of renal lesions after the first UTI in children may rule out VUR of clinical significance and reinforces the redundancy of invasive diagnostic techniques. Therefore, the priority of imaging strategies should focus on early identification of renal lesions to prevent further deterioration."
CD009185,0,2633344,0,A study of erythrocyte sedimentation rate in dengue hemorrhagic fever.,"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was determined in 180 DHF patients and 70 patients with various viral and bacterial infections using the Winthrobe method. Seventy-seven percent of DHF patients had normal ESR (less than 20 mm/hour) and 15% had slightly elevated ESR value (between 21-30 mm/hour). The other 8% had ESR in the range of 31-49 mm/hour. Among 7 patients in the latter group, one had definite evidence of complicating urinary tract infection while the other 6 cases had anemia and severe bleeding. The mean ESR in DHF patients (10.71 mm/hour) was significantly lower than the mean values in other groups of patients with viral infection (20.46 mm/hour), bacterial infection (34.81 mm/hour) and miscellaneous illnesses (35.29 mm/hour). The mean ESR in shock cases was 7.63 mm/hour while in non-shock cases it was 13.87 mm/hour and they are statistically different (p less than 0.05). The mean ESR during the time of shock was lower than in the pre-shock and post-shock period. Hemoconcentration, low level of albumin and fibrinogen and the presence of disseminated intravascular clotting (DIC) in a majority of DHF patients are most likely responsible to this observed lower ESR especially during shock period. The determination of ESR, which is simple, is therefore useful in differentiating DHF from bacterial infections and dengue shock syndrome from septic shock."

Modern imaging comprises ultrasonography, CT scan with injection of contrast medium, and cortical scintigraphy using GH or DMSA technetium. These investigations, used separately or in combination, are of considerable interest in the diagnosis, treatment and follow up of acute infections of the upper urinary tract.

High pressure moderate grade reflux was produced and renal function followed by means of quantitative renal camera studies using 131I hippuran. There was no change in renal function from sterile reflux even when intrarenal reflux occurred. When, however, infection was introduced, renal function decreased. We concluded that sterile moderate vesicoureteral or intrarenal reflux does not harm the kidney."
CD009185,0,8951910,0,99Tcm-DMSA renal scintigraphy for acute pyelonephritis in adults: planar and/or SPET imaging?,"A number of authors have indicated a more sensitive detection of renal cortical defects using single photon emission tomography (SPET) compared with planar imaging when performing 99Tcm-dimer-captosuccinic acid (99Tcm-DMSA) renal scintigraphy. The place of SPET in the evaluation of kidneys in adults suspected of acute pyelonephritis (APN) remains controversial, however. The aim of this study was to address the role of SPET in adult patients suspected of having APN. Planar and SPET 99Tcm-DMSA renal imaging was performed in 53 patients. The data sets were separated and presented in random order to three independent observers. The kidneys were divided into three segments, which were classified as normal, definitely abnormal or equivocal. Ir. a second step, the number of lesions (definite or equivocal) on planar and SPET imaging were counted. The overall concordance between the planar and SPET imaging scores was 90.9, 89.9 and 87.7% for the three observers, respectively. Inter-observer discordance was recorded in a small percentage of both planar and SPET images. The number of lesions, based on the average of the three observers, was 22 for planar and 25 for SPET imaging. Obvious differences between observers were noted. The planar images were more often interpreted as equivocal by the least experienced observer. The more experienced observers gained limited additional information using SPET routinely. Most equivocal lesions on the planar scintigrams were observed in the lower segment. For SPET, no such distribution was noted. High-quality 99Tcm-DMSA images allow the detection of the same number of lesions as SPET in adults suspected of APN."

CD009185,0,2691478,0,Urinary tract infections with tissue penetration in children: cefotaxime compared with amoxycillin/clavulanate.,"In children, the site of urinary tract infection (acute pyelonephritis or cystitis) cannot usually be accurately determined from the clinical presentation. The severity of the urinary tract infection (risk of renal scars) is best correlated with its estimated degree of tissue penetration clinically (fever, general condition) and on laboratory tests (sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein). The duration of parenteral antibiotic therapy, especially in children (taking account of difficult venous access and the cost of hospitalization) needs to be specified beyond the initial period required for sterilization of the urine (usually less than 48 h). We conducted a study in children older than one year to compare the efficacy and tolerance of two treatment regimens for urinary tract infection with tissue penetration: cefotaxime 100 mg/kg/d in four divided iv doses for 14 days (group I) and amoxycillin/clavulanate 100 mg/kg/d in four divided iv doses for seven days with conversion to the oral route at a dosage of 50 mg/kg/d for seven days (group II). The randomised protocol included ten patients in each group, comparable with respect to sex, age and history. Clinical efficacy (time until the patient became afebrile), bacteriological efficacy (sterilization of the urine), and biological efficacy (time to normalization of the indices of the acute inflammatory response) were identical for both groups regardless of the duration of iv antibiotic treatment (seven days for amoxycillin/clavulanate; 14 days for cefotaxime).

CD009185,0,7970949,0,Interleukin 6 response to urinary tract infection in childhood.,"This study analyzed the interleukin 6 (IL-6) response in 114 children with suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). Urine and serum samples were obtained at the time of enrollment. There were 90 children with UTI, 41 with and 49 without a temperature > or = 38.5 degrees C. The remaining 24 children did not have bacteriuria; 11 were febrile and 13 were not. The urinary IL-6 concentrations were higher in the children with UTI (mean, 129 units/ml) than in the children without bacteriuria (mean, 7 units/ml, P < 0.01). In contrast the serum IL-6 did not differ between children with or without UTI or between children with or without a temperature > or = 38.5 degrees C. The urinary IL-6 response was higher in children who were infected with P fimbriated Escherichia coli than in other children with UTI (P < 0.05). There was a correlation of urinary IL-6 with the degree of proteinuria, hematuria and urinary leukocyte counts (P < 0.001, P < 0.05, P < 0.05, respectively) but not with serum IL-6, CRP or temperature, and of serum IL-6 to C-reactive protein (P = 0.053) and renal concentrating capacity (P < 0.05).

CD009185,0,3901351,0,Special problems in the diagnosis and treatment of surgical sepsis.,"Since sepsis is the most frequent single cause of death after surgery and trauma, its development should be anticipated in elderly patients or those with disease or trauma causing intestinal leaks, particularly if the patient had massive transfusions or was in shock. Diagnosis may be extremely difficult, particularly if the infection is intraperitoneal. Furthermore, patients with impaired host defenses may show only a failure to thrive and then a progressive MOF. Physical examination is usually not very helpful. Gallium and indium scans and ultrasonography are only about 50 to 60 per cent accurate. Ultrasonography followed by HIDA and PIPIDA scans may be very useful in diagnosing acute acalculous cholecystitis, which appears to be an increasingly frequent problem in these patients. Computerized tomographic scans are at least 80 to 90 per cent accurate in diagnosing intra-abdominal abscesses, but the diagnosis of peritonitis is still largely clinically based. Even without clear evidence of infection, the critically ill patient with MOF and previous abdominal trauma, surgery, or disease should probably have the abdomen explored (that is, a blind laparotomy). If generalized peritonitis is found, it may be wise to leave the abdomen open and re-explore and débride it daily until it is clean. Percutaneous drainage of abdominal abscesses is being performed increasingly and is of special value in the 30 to 50 per cent of patients with single bacterial abscesses in which the drainage tract does not cross bowel or peritoneum and there is no underlying intestinal leak. Antibiotics are only a second line of defense, and their use should be directed by smear and culture results when possible. For abdominal infections, coverage for gram-negative anaerobes and Bacteroides fragilis is essential. If the infection persists for more than 2 to 3 weeks, infection by enterococci and fungi must be considered. If shock develops, maintaining an O2 consumption of at least 130 to 160 ml per minute per m2 is a particularly important part of the resuscitation. Although controversial, raising the hematocrit to 40 to 45 per cent or higher is often of value."

The findings were: Most high-grade vesicopelvic refluxes were detected by both methods consistently. Discrepant results of high-grade vesicopelvic refluxes were seen in 6 kidneys from 4 children. Main advantages of RNVC are the quick results and the ease of interpretation of these results. In RNVC the whole urinary tract can be observed during the filling phase as well as during the voiding and postvoiding phase. In sonography, the different parts of the urinary tract must be explored one after another during the filling, voiding, and postvoiding phase. The investigation by sonography is time consuming and a strongly investigator-dependent procedure."

High blood glucose initially required insulin therapy, but finally returned to normal levels through administration of oral antidiabetics. Although leukocytosis and low grade fever continued, the patient was discharged on day 53 with a negative CRP. CT scan indicated that the emphysematous change was localized after three months and almost resolved after four months. Renal scintigram indicated the residual function of the affected kidney. Because of the possibility of residual renal function and the cure by conservative therapy alone, the conservative therapy is preferred when the initial treatment is effective."

In some patients it can produce an acute pulmonary reaction ranging from mild dyspnea to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, chills, cough, and chest pain. Physical examination generally reveals an acutely ill, extremely apprehensive patient in varying degrees of respiratory distress. Fever is usually present and there is an increase in heart rate and respiratory rate. Cyanosis, rales, and a maculopapular rash are common findings. Laboratory studies typically demonstrate a leukocytosis with eosinophilia, varying degrees of hypoxia and hypocapnia, and a mild to moderate elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The chest x-ray study may be normal but more often demonstrates bilateral lower lobe interstitial infiltrates frequently accompanied by pleural effusions. Treatment in the majority of cases requires only stopping the drug, but steroids, bronchodilators, or antihistamines may be used in selected cases.

In an attempt to differentiate APN from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we evaluated the ability of power Doppler ultrasonography (PDU) to predict renal parenchymal involvement, as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m )Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy. The study comprised 62 patients, 46 girls and 16 boys, aged 2 weeks to 5 years, admitted to the pediatric department with febrile UTI. All children were examined by PDU and DMSA scintigraphy within the first 3 days of admission. In the group of 31 patients with one or more DMSA scan abnormalities, the PDU showed a matching perfusion defect in 27 (87%). Of 26 children with normal DMSA scintigraphy, the PDU evaluation was also normal in 24. The sensitivity and specificity of PDU for the detection of affected kidneys were 87% and 92.3%, and the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 93.1% and 85.7%, respectively.

Seventy-four infants with pyelonephritis, 44 girls and 30 boys (mean age at their first pyelonephritic episode 4.12 months, median 3 months), were enrolled in the study. Voiding cystourethrography (VCU) and ultrasonography (US) were performed within 6 weeks following the infection. DMSA was performed at least 4 months after the urinary tract infection (UTI). The renal parenchymal pathology was defined as focal or multifocal defects or as a split renal uptake of less than 45%. DMSA scintigraphy revealed that 19% (14/74) of the children had renal damage. Renal parenchymal findings were observed only when VUR was present, and its grade was above 3/5. No abnormality was found in 51 renal units without reflux, 9 with VUR grade 1/5, and 54 with grade 2/5. Renal pathology was observed in 9/24 renal units with VUR grade 3, 3/8 with grade 4, and 2/2 with grade 5. No correlation was found between renal parenchymal defects and clinical presentation of the pyelonephritis, type of the microorganism, presence of bacteremia, or the number of recurrent infections. In adequately treated infants, renal damage is probably due to a reflux-associated, preexisting, congenital renal parenchymal pathology and not to the inflammatory process. We suggest that DMSA scintigraphy should not be performed routinely in every infant with UTI and should be reserved primarily for children with VUR grade 3 and above."

Both planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained for DMSA scan. DMSA scans were repeated in those patients with abnormal initial scan. DMSA-SPECT showed normal findings in 2, single renal cortical detect (RCD) in 9 and multiple RCD in 16 (including nonvisualization in 2). Of the 11 kidneys with normal findings or single RCD on DMSA-SPECT, only 1 (9%) showed vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on VCU (grade I). A large proportion of those with multiple RCDs showed abnormal findings on IVP (44%, 7/16), US (38%, 6/16) or VCU (31%, 5/16); 63% in any of these three studies. 5 of 6 patients with VUR had multiple RCDs on DMSA-SPECT, and 3 of these 5 showed no abnormality on IVP or US. 7 patients who needed other managements besides initial standard antibiotic treatment had multiple RCDs on DMSA-SPECT. 15 normal women were also studied and showed normal DMSA-SPECT, US and IVP, in all cases. Follow-up DMSA-SPECT was done in 16 patients (7 with single RCD, 9 with multiple RCD). All 7 patients with single RCD showed improvement, in those with multiple RCDs improvement was observed in 2, no change in 7 on follow-up studies. We conclude: (1) DMSA-SPECT is a useful initial diagnostic tool in adult women with recurrent APN to identify patients who need more extensive radiological studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In the authors' opinion, most important diagnostic methods are excretory urography, dye tests, cystoscopy with retrograde ureteral catheterization and ureteropyelography. Isotope methods of examination and renal echography are of major value for diagnosis of uretero-vaginal fistulas. Early in 1988 vaginography was included in the group of methods for diagnosis of urogenital fistulas."

Ultrasonography of the urinary tract was performed on admission and together with DMSA scintigraphy (< 10 days from admission). Urine NAG/creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine quotients were measured daily and after 6-8 weeks. Ultrasonography revealed abnormalities in 12 of 39 (31%) patients [11/32 patients (34%) with positive DMSA scintigraphy], while DMSA uptake defects were present in 32 of 39 (82%) patients [21/28 < 1 year (75%), 11/11 > 1 year (100%), P = 0.08]. Urine NAG/creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine quotients were significantly higher in children < 1 year with APN, as well as in non-renal fever controls, than in older children. However, in both age groups the urine NAG/creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine quotients were significantly higher in APN than in non-renal fever. The urine NAG and albumin excretion decreased rapidly after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy and had normalized at 6-8 weeks. The size and grade of the DMSA uptake defect (DMSA score) did not correlate with duration of disease at admission, maximum C-reactive protein or maximum fever. The urine NAG/creatinine quotient in the children < 1 year showed, however, a significant correlation with the DMSA score (r = 0.58, P < 0.05), while no correlation was found in the older children. We conclude that DMSA scintigraphy is a sensitive method to confirm the clinical diagnosis of APN, although a substantial number of infants appear to have normal scans. Early determination of the urine NAG/creatinine and albumin/ creatinine quotients may further improve the diagnostics in the infant."

A total of 545 serial serum CRP concentrations were determined. In group 1, CRP concentrations were below the detection limit of the method (10 mg/L) except in one neonate who suffered from neonatal anoxia but whose clinical course was uncomplicated (CRP: 31 mg/L within 24 h of life). Thirty-three neonates of group 2 had CRP values consistently below 10 mg/L while 16 had elevated CRP concentrations at least on one occasion ranging from 10 to 70 mg/L. Diagnoses other than bacterial infection could explain the raised CRP concentrations in neonates of group 2.

Current nuclear medicine methodology can be applied for accurate evaluation of renal function and for renal imaging in a wide variety of clinical situations. Total renal function can be estimated from the plasma clearance of agents excreted by glomerular filtration or tubular secretion, and individual function can be estimated by imaging combined with renography. A major area of radionuclide application is in the evaluation of obstructive uropathy. The introduction of diuretic renography and the use of computer-generated regions of interest offer the clinician added useful data which may aid in diagnosis and management. Imaging is of proven value also in trauma, renovascular hypertension, and acute and chronic renal failure. Methods for the evaluation of residual urine, vesicoureteral reflux, and testicular torsion have achieved increasing clinical use. These many procedures assure a meaningful and useful role for the application of nuclear medicine in genitourinary imaging."

An individual analysis ascertained that the patients who showed a low Ca(2+)-ATPase activity had marked signs of inflammation in the body, as evidenced by ESR, seromucoid and fibrinogen concentrations. These patients had more significantly depressed immune defense mechanisms as reflected by the levels of immunoglobulins, T-lymphocytes, complement, the neutrophil phagocytosis, and urinary IgA concentrations). Variations were also found in examining the excretion of a number of metabolites. There was a substantial decrease in urea, creatinine, titrated acid, phosphorus excretions in patients with deficient Ca(2+)-ATPase activity than in those with its high activity.

The patients were divided into three age groups: 16 to 39 years, 40 to 59 years, and older than 60 years. The following parameters were calculated on the basis of peripheral blood leukocyte composition and ESR: leukocyte intoxication index (LII), lymphocyte index (LymI), leukocyte shift index (LSI), leukocyte index (LI), leukocyte to ESR ratio index (LESRRI), lymphocyte-granulocyte index (LGI), total index (TI), neutrophile to lymphocyte ratio index (NLymRI), neutrophile to monocyte ratio index (NMRI), and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio index (LMRI). The majority of the indexes (LII, LymI, LSI, LI, LESRRI, LGI, and LMRI) in acute inflammation processes and some of them (LESRRI, NLymRI, and LMRI) in chronic inflammation altered significantly in all the age groups, which demonstrated that compensatory and adaptive mechanisms remained preserved in the elderly. The were age-dependent differences in blood responses to inflammation: LymI, LI, and LGI were significantly lower in the elderly with chronic pyelonephritis, whereas in Groups 1 and 2 there were no changes; NMRI was decreased in Groups 1 and 2 in chronic pyelonephritis and did not differ from the elderly controls. In acute inflammation, there were no significant differences from the controls in NlymRI in Group 3, while this parameter in Groups 1 and 2 differ from that in the controls. Thus, hematological indices make it possible to assess the work of effectory mechanisms of the immune system, the degree of their compensation in patients belonging to different age groups."

CD009185,0,8941580,0,Tumour necrosis factor soluble receptors I and II and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in acute pyelonephritis in relation to bacterial virulence-associated traits and renal function.,"Urinary tract infections activate both mucosal and systemic inflammatory responses reflected by elevation of cytokine concentrations in serum and urine. We determined urine and serum concentrations of tumour necrosis factor soluble receptors I and II (sTNFR I and sTNFR II) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in 41 women with acute pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli, 2 weeks after the infection, during a subsequent episode of cystitis or asymptomatic bacteriuria and also later when the same patients were free from bacteriuria. Concentrations of sTNFR I, sTNFR II and IL-1ra were related to the expression of five virulence markers of E. coli, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and to the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum. Patients with acute pyelonephritis had elevated serum concentrations of sTNFR I and sTNFR II compared to healthy women (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The concentrations of sTNFR I and sTNFR II in urine were significantly higher in patients with acute pyelonephritis compared to controls (P < 0.001 in both cases). The concentration of sTNFR II in urine was higher in patients infected by E. coli producing haemolysin (P = 0.05) and in patients infected by E. coli expressing hydrophobic properties (P = 0.05) compared to patients infected by strains without these virulence traits. Patients who had high concentrations of sTNFR II in serum during acute pyelonephritis had lower GFR at follow-up (r = -0.48, P = 0.05). Patients who responded with a marked increase in CRP had higher sTNFR I and sTNFR II in urine (r = 0.58, P < 0.01 and r = 0.48, P < 0.01, respectively). The concentrations of sTNFR I and sTNFR II in serum and urine decreased during follow-up and were lower 2 weeks after the infection when all patients were free from bacteriuria. IL-1ra in serum was elevated during pyelonephritis (P < 0.001) while that in urine was significantly lower compared to controls (P < 0.001). It is concluded that the increased concentrations of TNF receptors may block the cytotoxic and inflammatory actions and reduce the sensibility of renal cells to TNF alpha-mediated effects."
CD009185,0,8213371,0,[Clinical studies on the need of prophylactic antibiotics during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy].,"We examined whether prophylactic antibiotics are necessary or not during the ESWL treatment for patients with urolithiasis. Twenty-eight patients with unilateral renal or ureteral stones composed of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate or the mixed stones were treated with MPL 9000 between May 12 and September 30, 1992. Although 17 patients (60.7%) had complications of pyuria before treatment, none of the 28 patients had taken any prophylactic antibiotics during the treatment. To evaluate the clinical signs of infection, we examined the white blood cell count, in blood and urine sediment and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) value at the time of 1, 3 and 7 days after ESWL treatment, and body temperature and urine culture at the time immediately after the treatment in addition to the above-mentioned days, compared with the pre-treatment data. White blood cell count at one day after ESWL treatment was significantly elevated both in the patients with and without pyuria, while body temperature at the time immediately after the treatment was significantly elevated only in the patients with pyuria. Six of the 23 patients (26.1%) with preoperative sterile urine and who had urine culture immediately after ESWL, had bacteriuria. However, none of the 28 patients had any clinically significant infectious complications during ESWL treatment without any antibiotics therapy. We concluded that it is important to examine urine culture immediately after ESWL treatment for early protection from complication of urinary tract infection and that administration of prophylactic antibiotics is not necessary during ESWL treatment for patients with non-infection stones even concomitantly with pyuria."

CD009185,0,21093340,0,Escherichia coli septic arthritis of a lumbar facet joint following urinary tract infection.,"Septic arthritis of a lumbar facet joint is a rare condition. We report the case of a 77-year-old diabetic woman who developed fever and back pain 15 days after she had been diagnosed with a genitourinary infection for which she had received ciprofloxacin. Physical examination showed fever (38°C) and pain on pressure over the lower lumbar spinous vertebral apophyses and over the lower left paraspinal musculature. Investigations showed a white cell count of 8.4×10⁹/l, neutrophils 85.3%, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 125 mm/h, and C-reactive protein of ≥9 mg/dl. Two blood cultures were both positive for Escherichia coli resistant to ciprofloxacin. There was no growth of pathogens from the urine cultures. Scintigraphy with gallium citrate Ga⁶⁷ showed vertical lower lumbar (L4-L5) radionuclide uptake lateralized to the left. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine demonstrated signal changes and alteration of the structure at the left interapophyseal L4-L5 joint, an adjacent small collection of 1cm in diameter, and infiltration of the surrounding soft tissues, which extended to the epidural area, left conjunction hole, and paraspinal muscles. The patient was treated with intravenous cefotaxime and gentamicin and bed rest for 21 days, and recovered. This is the first report of interapophyseal arthritis caused by E. coli."
CD009185,0,9259528,0,Renal 99Tc(m)-DMSA SPET and planar imaging: are they really the same?,"Previous studies have suggested that more defects are detected on SPET than on planar DMSA images. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences between planar and SPET imaging. Sixty-four kidneys from pyelonephritic patients were studied using both techniques. An automated algorithm for reorientation and centring of the SPET images was used to minimize inter-observer variability. Reduced uptake and contour defects showed different localization on planar and SPET imaging. Coincidence of defects on both types of image was low. We also noted a dependence on defect frequency content for detectability. Image contrast played a noticeable role in the detection of defects. Differences in contrast between SPET and planar images may be responsible for the variable success in the detection of defects. Contour defects are seen more frequently on tomographic slices, whereas reduced uptake defects are seen more frequently on planar images. A difference is also noted between the cortical and calyceal zones for differently contrasted lesions. SPET and planar DMSA images can potentially provide a different diagnosis of renal lesions."

We examined the mechanism of damage to 32P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from the human c-Ha-ras-1 proto-oncogene and the p53 tumor suppressor gene exposed to 365-nm UVA light in the presence of NA. NA plus UVA light caused damage to the double-stranded DNA fragment at consecutive guanine residues, whereas damage to the single-stranded DNA fragment was caused at single guanines and thymines. The formation of 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine in native DNA exceeded that in denatured DNA at high NA concentrations. The ESR spin destruction method suggested that DNA damage was caused through electron transfer from guanine residues to photoexcited NA. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that NA can cause skin cancer through DNA damage mediated by its photoactivation."

CD009185,0,10961818,0,UTI: diagnosis and evaluation in symptomatic pediatric patients.,"We retrospectively reviewed data on 260 hospitalized pediatric patients with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). To ascertain the colony-forming units (CFU)/mL compatible with the diagnosis of UTI, a culture from a catheterized urine specimen containing >1,000 CFU/mL was considered diagnostic of UTI and resulted in imaging by renal ultrasound, voiding cystourethrography, and renal nuclear scan with Tc99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). A positive DMSA renal scan is indicative of pyelonephritis. We used logistic regression analysis to determine which patient characteristics were predictive of pyelonephritis. We determined that, in hospitalized pediatric patients, the colony count of the positive urine culture, the type of organism grown in culture, and the voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) result (positive or negative for vesicoureteral reflux) did not predict which patients had pyelonephritis. In females, advancing age of the patient and positive renal ultrasound results were predictive of which patients had pyelonephritis when we controlled for other factors. We feel this emphasizes the importance of a thorough evaluation of hospitalized symptomatic patients, including patients with colony counts of 1,000 to 50,000 CFU/mL, to locate the level of infection and plan appropriate therapy."

CD009185,0,7244659,0,Medical imaging of renal diseases-suggested indication for different modalities.,"The diagnostic work-up of the urologic patient must be tailored to the presenting symptom complex, carefully selecting from the many modilities available, those most likely to establish the diagnosis and extent of the suspected lesions. Intravenous urography is the most rewarding initial procedure for many presenting symptoms, including suspected masses, pyuria, hematuria, and flank pain. Nuclear imaging is particularly effective in differentiating renal lobulations from true masses, in demonstrating parenchymal scarring in chronic pyelonephritis when the IVP is equivocal, and in assessing the decrease in perfusion and function in obstructive nephropathy when the IVP is indeterminate. It is the preferred procedure for acute renal infarction and acute tubular necrosis and has a greater sensitivity of detection for renal trauma than the IVP. Gallium-67 renal imaging appear helpful in the detection of occult pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis. However, it cannot differentiate focal acute pyelonephritis from abscess or abscess from neoplasm. Ultrasoneography is the initial procedure of choice in the differentiation of cystic from solid renal masses and in anuria or oliguria. When a kidney fails to visualize by IVP or nuclear imaging, it can confirm or rule out obstruction. In upper tract infections, it may demonstrate renal or perirenal abscess. Although retrograde pyelography is performed less frequently in recent years, it remains extremely useful in confirming and relieving obstructive uropathy and in delineating tumors of the collecting system. Computed tomography effectively demonstrates hydronephrosis, renal abscess, tumors, and cysts and retroperitoneal involvement. More experience is needed to judge the efficiency of ""dynamic"" CT for the quantification of renal function. Renal angiography remains invaluable as a secondary procedure (as opposed to initial screening) in renal trauma, vascular anomalies, and in renal tumors to delineate the anatomy of the arterial supply and possible renal vein involvement."
CD009185,0,3000683,0,Altered distribution of technetium-99m sodium pertechnetate associated with antimicrobial therapy.,"Three patients underwent brain scanning for evaluation of central nervous system disease and were simultaneously treated for infectious diseases unrelated to the central nervous process. All revealed intense vascular pooling on their brain images. The imaging studies had been performed following the administration of Tc-99m pertechnetate. None of the patients had prior nuclear medicine examinations to suggest the causal effect of stannous ion as a source of interference. All of the patients were on combination antimicrobial drugs: two on sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and one on isoniazid and ethambutol. One patient revealed 75% Tc-99m red cell tagging. Another patient's repeat brain scan with Tc-99m DTPA revealed normal distribution. Our findings suggest that patients on antimicrobial combination drug regimens who require brain scans should be imaged routinely with agents other than Tc-99m."
CD009185,0,10588266,0,Diagnosis of vesico-ureteric reflux.,"The demonstration and grading of reflux is crucial in examination and follow-up of any child with upper urinary tract infection. A variety of factors can influence the occurrence of reflux, e.g. race, genetics, state of maturation of the ureterovesical valve, diuresis, infection and bladder dysfunction, including obstruction and neurogenic disorders. Even when reflux is investigated under strictly standardized conditions, two consecutive bladder fillings frequently show different grades of reflux. Voiding cystourethrography is, to date, the only method with a generally accepted, well-defined grading of reflux. It also allows detection of intrarenal reflux and anatomical and functional information about the bladder and urethra that is unobtainable by other methods. It is therefore usually considered the method of choice. Radionuclide cystography and, possibly, contrast enhanced ultrasonography can be complementary to voiding cystourethrography, but mainly for postoperative follow-up and screening of siblings."
CD009185,0,10224840,0,Emphysematous pyelonephritis: imaging diagnosis and follow-up.,"We conducted the study to evaluate the efficacy and roles of different imaging modalities in the diagnosis and follow-up of emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) and to correlate imaging findings with clinical outcome. Retrospective analysis of the imaging studies and clinical outcome were performed in 28 consecutive patients with EPN. They were all initially treated with CT-guided percutaneous drainage (PCD). The imaging studies performed included plain abdominal radiography (KUB) (n = 28), sonography (US)(n = 24), intravenous urography (IVU)(n = 5), retrograde pyelography (RP)(n = 20) and computed tomography (CT)(n = 28). Follow-up imaging studies included CT(n = 23) and renal scintigraphy (n = 15). The sensitivities of detecting abnormal gas in EPN on KUB and US were 66% and 88%. The mortality rate was 11%, not associated with different types, stages or renal involvement. On the follow-up CT performed within one month of PCD, type I EPN evolved into type II in 86% of the cases. On the long-term follow-up CT, renal atrophy and focal scarring were revealed in the diffuse and focal renal involvement of EPN. The mean split renal function shown on the follow-up scintigraphy was 30%. We concluded KUB and US were valuable for screening EPN, although CT was the most specific and sensitive. Follow-up CT studies not only demonstrate the response of treatment but also depict the different courses and the results of different types and renal involvement of EPN, although not associated with mortality rate."
CD009185,0,10588269,0,Vesico-ureteric reflux and other risk factors for renal damage: identification of high- and low-risk children.,"This article reviews the literature with respect to various risk factors for permanent renal damage in children with urinary tract infection. Vesico-ureteric reflux is an important risk factor, but renal damage can occur in the absence of reflux. Renal damage does not always occur in the presence of gross reflux. Renal scars always develop at the same site as a previous infection in the kidney. Recurrent pyelonephritis and delay in therapy increase the likelihood of renal damage, although it is not known how long a delay is dangerous to the human kidney. Recent studies using 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy have not confirmed the findings of previous studies showing that children below 1 y of age are more vulnerable to renal damage. It is more likely that all children run the risk of renal scarring in cases of acute pyelonephritis. The role of bladder pressure is still not entirely understood. Therefore more studies are needed in order to determine the relationship between high voiding pressures in some, otherwise healthy, children with urinary tract infection and renal scarring. The importance of bacterial virulence in the development of renal scarring is unclear. DMSA scintigraphy and voiding cystourethrography are the most reliable tools for identifying children at risk of renal scarring. As a single method DMSA scintigraphy appears to be better than voiding cystourethrography."

CD009185,0,16110405,0,[Obstructive uropathy in childhood].,"""Obstructive uropathy"" is a generic term which combines different diseases in infants and childhood. Both the upper and lower urinary tract may be affected. Diseases of the urinary tract can cause an intrinsic obstruction. Sometimes tumours may cause a compression and as secondary effect an obstruction (extrinsic). Ultrasound is the key diagnostic tool and shows dilatation of the obstructed urinary tract. But for the functional exploration of babies and toddlers, renal scanning and X-ray examinations are necessary. These examinations lead to an exposure to radiation which necessitates careful indication. Some of the congenital diseases (for example ureteropelvic junction obstruction, megaureter) show a maturation without any intervention. So one has to decide whether to wait and see or to operate. A percutaneous nephrostomy or a DJ-catheter is not often used in the treatment of obstruction in general. These forms of drainage are more often used in the treatment of stones or of extrinsic obstruction. A pyelocutaneostomy or ureterocutaneostomy is a special surgical procedure in pediatric urology for transient drainage of the upper urinary tract (megaureter). The operation of a seriously ill new-born should be done in a centre for pediatric urology and pediatric nephrology. When the upper urinary tract is dilated, patients may need an antibiotic prophylaxis, because the dilatation of the upper urinary tract increases the risk of urinary tract infections (UTI). The indication for antibiotic prophylaxis should by guided by the criteria of the APN-Consensus Paper. Long-term follow-up is necessary and should comprise ultrasound, physical examination, controlling the blood pressure, urine analysis and blood tests. The aims of diagnostics, treatment and long-term follow-up are the preservation of renal function and to protect the children from UTI. This goal must be reached under conditions that are appropriate for children and their parents."

The children were randomly allocated to medical (n=147) or surgical (n=140) management and DMSA studies were performed during the follow up period at least 6 months after any urinary tract infection. Abnormal images were classified into four types: (1) large polar hypodensity with normal renal outline; (2) peripheral photon deficient defect(s) in a non-deformed kidney; (3) small renal image with normal contour; and (4) peripheral defect(s) with resultant irregularity of the renal outline. The DMSA findings were abnormal at entry in 235 (82%) with no difference in incidence or severity between the two treatment groups. During follow up, deterioration was observed in 25 medically and 23 surgically treated patients and comprised image deterioration alone in 17, image deterioration with corresponding reduction in differential function in 16 and reduction in relative function without image change in 15, with similar distribution between the two treatment groups. Deterioration was more frequent in children entering the study under the age of 2 years and in those with grade IV rather than grade III reflux.

The urine IL-6 and IL-8/creatinine quotients were also related to the urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and albumin/creatinine quotients. Presence of DMSA uptake defects, reflecting local inflammation, in children in the acute phase of pyelonephritis, were associated with elevated urine IL-6/creatinine quotients (median 27 pg/mumol); in children without DMSA changes there was no increase in quotients (median non-detectable) (P < 0.05). Persistent DMSA changes at the 1-year follow-up, probably reflecting renal scarring, were only seen in children with increased urine IL-6/creatinine quotients in the acute phase (P < 0.01). No correlation was found between urine IL-8 and DMSA uptake defects. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) at 6-8 weeks did not correlate with the urine cytokine levels in the acute phase. The urine excretion of NAG and albumin, reflecting renal dysfunction, was associated with values of both urine IL-6 and IL-8/creatinine quotients, but not with DMSA defects or VUR. Thus, the initial urine IL-6/creatinine quotients might be used as an indicator of risk for persistent renal damage in acute pyelonephritis."

Scientific Committee of Radionuclides in Nephrourology.,"A questionnaire related to cortical scintigraphy in children with urinary tract infection was submitted to 30 experts. A wide consensus was reached on several issues related to planar images: 99mTc dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) appears as the most appropriate tracer for renal imaging; dynamic tracers are considered to be inferior, in particular 99mTc diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, which is not recommended. The general opinion is that DMSA scintigraphy is not feasible with a minimal dose below 15 MBq, whereas the maximum dose should not be higher than 110 MBq. The dose schedule generally is based on body surface area, and sedation is only exceptionally given to children. Images are obtained 2 to 3 hours after injection, preferably with high resolution collimators; pinhole images are used by only half of the experts. Posterior and posterior oblique views are used by most of the experts, and the posterior view is acquired in supine positions. At least 200.000 kcounts or 5 minute acquisition is required for nonzoomed images. As a quality control, experts check the presence of blurred or double outlines on the DMSA images. Color images are not used and experts report on film or directly on the computer screen. As far as normal DMSA images are concerned, most experts agree on several normal variants. Hydronephrosis is not a contraindication for DMSA scintigraphy but constitutes a pitfall. Differential renal function generally is measured, but no consensus is reached whether or not background should be subtracted. Most of the experts consider 45% as the lowest normal value. A consensus is reached on some scintigraphic aspects that are likely to improve and on some others that probably represent persistent sequelae. There is a wide consensus for the systematic use of DMSA scintigraphy for detection of renal sequelae, whereas only 58% of the experts are systematically performing this examination during the acute phase of infection."

The location of the infection within the urinary tract influences decisions regarding both therapeutics and follow-up. Because clinical features and laboratory markers of infection at an early age are not specific, it is difficult to make a distinction between lower UTI and acute pyelonephritis. Procalcitonin (PCT) has been studied as a marker of severe bacterial infection. The aim of this study was to test the usefulness of PCT concentration in serum to distinguish between uncomplicated UTI and severe acute pyelonephritis with renal scars."

All subjects had spinal cord injury and had had contemporaneous comprehensive renal scintillation procedures and excretory urograms on 2 occasions 24 months or less apart. Each of the 469 kidneys was placed into 1 of 5 quintiles on the basis of its effective renal plasma flow at the first examination. The percentage of the kidneys that had clinically significant pyelocaliectasis or in which the pyelocaliectasis significantly worsened was 20.4 per cent in the lowest (first) quintile and 9.3, 2.2, 5.4 and 3.2 per cent in the second, third, fourth and fifth quintiles, respectively. Analogous data for ureterectasis were 16.1, 8.2, 2.2, 3.3 and 3.2 per cent. There was a significant (p less than 0.01) correlation between effective renal plasma flow and renal parenchymal thickness. Kidneys with renal calculi averaged effective renal plasma flows about 25 per cent lower than those of kidneys free of calculi.

Total renal clearance of DTPA was calculated with a disappearance curve derived from the largest extrarenal area in the field of view of a gamma camera with diverging collimator. Split renal function was estimated with the slopes of second phase renograms. The plasma disappearance clearance of DTPA, calculated using one compartment model with two late blood samples, gave similar results with the clearance estimated from the body disappearance curves. The proportional planimetric renal parenchymal areas had good correlation with the split clearance estimated from renogram slopes. The method offers data on renal function and urinary tract dynamics which is very valuable in the follow-up of children with recurrent urinary tract infection and vesicoureteric reflux."

The purposes of this retrospective study were (1) to assess the relationship between DRF obtained during acute pyelonephritis and at follow-up, and (2) to elucidate the value of initial DRF in predicting subsequent renal scars. A total of 47 children were enrolled. All had both unilateral acute pyelonephritis diagnosed by initial DMSA renal scans, and follow-up DMSA renal scans. We found the correlation between initial and follow-up DRF poor (adjusted R2 = 0.396). Whether or not renal scars developed determined the follow-up DRF. Vesicoureteral reflux was significantly more common in children who developed renal scars. In addition, the higher the grade of vesicoureteral reflux, the lower the follow-up DRF and the improvement in DRF. When using a DRF of 46% as the cut-off value to predict subsequent renal scars, the sensitivity and specificity were 47.8% and 83.3%, respectively. Owing to the low sensitivity, initial DRF is not suitable for predicting the occurrence of renal scars."

CD009185,0,14598100,0,Vascular prosthetic implantation is associated with prolonged inflammation following aortic aneurysm surgery.,"The purpose of this study was to semiquantify the magnitude of surgical stress in patients undergoing aortic surgery by measuring inflammatory responses perioperatively, focusing on cytokine secretion. Serum concentrations of interleukin (IL) 1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrotizing factor (TNF) Alpha were measured in patients undergoing abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysmectomy preoperatively and periodically thereafter for 2 weeks. Urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI/Cr) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score also were determined. Indices of inflammation and cytokine concentrations peaked at 1-3 days after surgery and decreased thereafter; however, IL-8 increased again after day 7. Concentrations of IL-8, UTI/Cr, and CRP and the SIRS score were still higher 14 days after surgery than preoperatively. The maximum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were higher after thoracic than abdominal aortic repair; however, the maximum values of cytokines were not correlated with operative factors in all patients. A patient suffering from graft infection showed an increase in cytokine concentrations on day 7. The inflammatory response does not return to preoperative values within 2 weeks of surgery in patients undergoing thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The prolonged secretion of IL-8 suggests a host reaction to the synthetic prosthesis. A large increase in inflammatory cytokines on day 7 may indicate infection of the vascular graft."
CD009185,0,1661570,0,Imaging in urinary tract infection.,"The relationship of vesicoureteric reflex (VUR) and renal scarring was studied in 94 children (188 kidneys) with proved urinary tract infection in a district general hospital. There were 61 girls and 33 boys, with nine girls and 17 boys aged less than 1 year, 31 girls and nine boys aged between 1 and 5 years, the remaining 28 children were over 5 years of age. All children had a micturating cystourethrogram and a 99mTc (technetium) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Forty two of the 188 kidneys were scarred and 70 of the kidneys had VUR. Only 37.1% of the kidneys with reflux were scarred but 61.9% of the scarred kidneys had VUR. In children of less than 1 year, 48% of kidneys with VUR were scarred whereas 70.6% of scarred kidneys had reflux. In children between 1 and 5 years of age only 36.4% of kidneys with VUR were scarred but 63.2% of scarred kidneys had VUR. There is good correlation between the detection of a scarred kidney on DMSA and the presence of vesicoureteric reflux. However the detection of reflux particularly in children over 1 year of age shows poor correlation with renal scarring. This suggests that the primary imaging in children over 1 year of age presenting with a urinary tract infection should be of the kidney: a cystogram should be performed only if the DMSA scan is abnormal."

We examined the urinanalysis (UA) findings on admission among infants less than 16 weeks old, with and without acute pyelonephritis (APN), as defined by the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan findings, performed during a 57-month period. Forty-nine cases with a positive DMSA scan were compared with 79 negative study cases. A negative UA for leukocytes (< 5 white blood cells/high power field) was found in 4 of 49 (8.1%) cases with APN by DMSA, and in 34 of 79 (43%) cases with a negative DMSA (odds ratio 10.88 (95% confidence interval, 2.31 to 70.3; P < 0.001)). Three of the 4 infants not suspected to have APN by their UA findings would have been admitted for a full sepsis workup based on their clinical presentation and/or their laboratory findings on admission. We conclude that a fresh UA may be a sufficient screening method for the exclusion of APN in infants assessed for fever of no obvious origin."

Early diagnosis of latent pyelonephritis makes this method especially valuable both for the selection of patients for further thorough examination and for the start of adequate therapy. Scintigraphy serves as a reliable criterion for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy in patients with chronic pyelonephritis (CP). Changes of scintigraphy parameters coincide quite exactly with the changed level of arterial pressure, concentration and nitrogen clearing function of the kidneys during treatment. This method (sectoral scintigraphy) is very important when used over time in CP patients with chronic renal insufficiency making it possible to detect with a sufficient degree of significance the improvement as well as impairment of renal function which is a crucial point for the choice of further therapeutic tactics."

Identification of the new markers in relation to acute pyelonephritis (APN) and its treatment is essential for designing interventions that would minimize tissue damage. This prospective study investigated the first UTI infection in 71 children (age range: 1-24 months) in respect to interleukin-6 (IL-6) -174G/C polymorphism and renal scarring. The patients were divided into an APN group and a lower UTI group according to dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The IL-6 -174G/C genotypes were determined by tetra-primer ARMSPCR. Serum IL-6 was significantly higher in the APN group than in the group with lower UTI (p<0.05). In both groups, the -174G/C genotype and allele frequencies did not differ significantly from the control group. The highest white blood cell (WBC) count was observed in the CC genotype (p<0.05). A non-significant trend toward higher serum IL-6 was observed in children with CC genotype. On follow-up DMSA imaging performed 6 months later, renal scarring was detected in 36.9% of APN children. We did not find the significant association of IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism with APN and/or postinfectious renal scarring. These results indicate that serum IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in children with APN than in patients with lower UTI."

However, 26% of kidneys evaluated at 1 year and at 5 years showed a markedly decreased uptake on the renogram. In 70% of cases, this decreased uptake was related to the development of stenosis of the uretero-ileal anastomosis or pyelonephritis. Renal function remained stable at 5 years in group A, corresponding to patients with good initial renal function (n = 22, p = 0.07), and in group B, corresponding to patients with poor initial renal function (n = 7, p = 0.9). Similarly, the function of solitary kidneys did not deteriorate over the 5-year postoperative follow-up period (n = 7, p = 0.5). The functional value of the kidneys was therefore not globally altered after ileal conduit urinary diversion.

CD009185,0,9876948,0,"Circulating interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in children with febrile infection--a comparison with C-reactive protein.","Circulating interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were examined in 42 febrile children with fever lasting more than 4 days. Their diagnosis were probable viral syndrome in 22, urinary tract infection (UTI) in 10, and probable bacterial pneumonia in 10. None of our study patients had detectable serum IL-1 beta. TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in children with pneumonia than in those with viral syndrome (p < 0.01). Children with UTI and pneumonia had significantly higher IL-6 and CRP, compared to those with probable viral syndrome (p < 0.01 for both IL-6 and CRP). When appropriate cutoff values are chosen, IL-6 had greatly improved specificity (86.4%, > 20 pg/ml) to demonstrate UTI and pneumonia, as compared to that using CRP (48%, > 40 mg/l). After three days' antibiotic treatment, IL-6 fell to control levels in children with UTI and pneumonia, while CRP remained elevated. There was no difference in TNF-alpha values before and after treatment. Thus, IL-6, rather than IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, may be a helpful diagnostic tool for evaluation of pediatric febrile infection. Sequential studies involving more patients are needed to determine whether IL-6 is better than CRP in this clinical setting."

At presentation (mean age 5 years) all had VUR (grade III-V in 68) and urinary tract infection (UTI); there was renal scarring in 85 (acquired before referral in 11 and during follow-up in 1), hypertension in 6 and impaired renal function in 5. They were managed and followed prospectively by one paediatrician; 63% of these children remained free from UTI; VUR persisted in 63 and had resolved in 69% of 193 children managed medically. At follow-up, 61% of adults had remained free from infection; 17 adults had hypertension and/or raised plasma creatinine, 16 with scarred kidneys. Their deterioration was predictable because of scar type, blood pressure or plasma creatinine levels in childhood. No new scars developed after puberty. Renal growth rates were unaffected by initial severity or persistence of VUR. On the later questionnaire, 9 further adults, mean age 38 years, had moderate hypertension. The adults with complications were those with extensive renal scarring and/or at least borderline hypertension in childhood. Those with VUR, but no scarring, and managed carefully in childhood, did not suffer serious consequences as adults. There is a need for early recognition and treatment of children with VUR and UTI to limit scar development."

CD009185,0,16898507,0,[Serum TGF-beta1 level in children with reflux nephropathy].,"Reflux nephropathy is a progressive renal scarring due to chronic pyelonephritis developing in patients with vesico-ureteral reflux. TGF-beta1 is thought to be one of the most important factor that initiates reflux nephropathy and stimulates its progression. The purpose of the study was to assess serum TGF-beta1 level in children with reflux nephropathy. The study comprised 36 children (12 boys and 24 girls) aged 1-17 years with vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring confirmed by scintigraphic evaluation. In most children recurrent urinary tract infections were observed. In 13 (27.8%) children, a first episode of urinary tract infection occurred in infancy. Primary vesico-ureteral reflux was diagnosed in 18 (50.0%) children. Secondary vesico-ureteral reflux due to anatomic or functional subvesical obstruction were recognized in 11 (30.6%) and 7 (19.4%) children, respectively. Serum TGF-beta1 levels were measured by ELISA. The mean serum TGF-beta1 level in children with reflux nephropathy was significantly lower than that in controls (92.04 +/- 33.14 ng/ml vs 141.73 +/- 45.38 ng/ml). This might be a result of increased influx of serum TGF-beta1 into renal parenchyma and/or increased urinary TGF-beta1 excretion due to tubular damage in children with reflux nephropathy."

The aim of the present study was to analyse data for children 0-15y of age who consulted a general practitioner with symptoms of an infection. During the 2 weeks studied, 4049 children were consulted. Respiratory tract infections (RTI) were the predominant diagnoses, above all among the youngest children, while the proportion of urinary tract infections and skin infections increased with increasing age. Between the y 2000 and 2002, the proportion of children allocated the diagnosis streptococcal tonsillitis and pneumonia decreased (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) while the proportion of common cold increased (p<0.001). Antibiotic prescribing decreased from 55% to 48% (p<0.001) for respiratory infections between the years studied. The only significant changes in type of antibiotics prescribed were the increase of isoxazolylpenicillins (p<0.001) used for skin infection and the decrease of macrolides (p=0.001). A diagnostic test was used in more than half of the consultations. Of children allocated a RTI diagnosis, 36% were prescribed antibiotics when a C-reactive protein test was performed compared to 58% in those not tested. Further studies are needed in general practice to determine the optimal use of near-patient tests in children with RTI."

VUR was moderate (grade III) in 3 and massive (grade IV and V) in 5. VUR was estimated as primary in one child and as secondary in 6 (anterior urethral ring 2, posterior urethral valve 2, neurogenic bladder 2). IRR was localized to the upper area in 3, to the lower area in 2, and to the whole kidney in 3. Sixty percent of those with IRR in the polar areas was associated with moderate VUR, whereas all of those in the whole kidney was with massive one. Renal scarring was assessed by excretory urography (IVP) and/or 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy. Seven kidneys were evaluable; polar scars in 5, dwarf with polar scar in 1 and dwarf with poor function (suspected hypodysplasia) in 1. In 4 kidneys new scar formation was observed. It was noted, however, that IRR did not necessarily accompany renal scars of the corresponding areas and IRR to the whole kidney did not always lead to multiple scars in the whole kidney. The nature and problems of IRR, renal scars and 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy were discussed. It was suggested that urinary infection played a greater part in renal scar formation."

The mean age of patients with UTI (53.6+/-20.0 yrs) was found higher than the patients without UTI (39.7+/-22.2 yrs), (p<0.01), whereas there was no gender associated difference between these two groups (p>0.01). No patient had developed symptoms suggesting UTI. All of the UTI has developed in patients with urinary catheter. Infections occurred in 72.2% of the patients with catheter lasting for seven days or more, and 24.3% of those lasting less than seven days (p<0.001). The UTI development rate was found as 31.3% in the patients who had been using antibiotics, while this ratio was 50% in those who had not used antibiotics (p<0.05). Pyuria was detected in 86.1% and 17.9% of the patients with and without UTI, respectively (p<0.001). Detection of bacteria in urine by the examination of Gram stained preparations, and the tests of peripheral blood leucocyte counting and CRP levels were not found sensitive and specific for nosocomial UTI. The prevalence of UTI increased gradually by the duration of hospitalization. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were found as Candida (27.2%), Escherichia coil (27.2%) and staphylococci (12.9%). Since nosocomial UTI which are important causes of morbidity in intensive care unit patients, are difficult to diagnose and treat, more efforts should be used for preventive measures."

More abnormalities were detected by DMSA study when compared to scars on IVP. When both studies were abnormal there was an excellent correlation on a site by site basis. Fever or systemic disorder was not a reliable sign to determine whether there was upper tract involvement with infection. The incidence of DMSA abnormalities in infants increased with high grade vesicoureteral reflux and decreased with low grade reflux. There was no significant difference in the incidence of abnormal kidneys between the infected and noninfected groups, suggesting that renal scarring may occur with sterile reflux."

About 85% of the patients had positive Tc99-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and 58% had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Kidney sonography aided in the diagnosis and treatment in 10% of the patients. Age, sex, presence or laterality of VUR did not contribute to defective DMSA scan (pyelonephritis) (P > 0.05). Delayed diagnosis and treatment of febrile UTI is associated with a high incidence of positive findings of DMSA scan irrespective of age, sex or presence/absence of VUR. In mild VUR, the DMSA scan may be normal while in patients with moderate and severe VUR the DMSA scan is almost always abnormal. Thus, our study shows that a normal DMSA scan can help in ruling out moderate to severe forms of VUR and that cystography remains an excellent and standard tool for the diagnosis of VUR."

Fifty-nine children with previous UTI underwent both 99mTc-DMSA and MAG3 within 4 wk of each other. Differential function and assessment of the images were undertaken. There is close correlation (R2 = 0.97) between the differential function. Analysis of the 99mTc-DMSA and functional MAG3 images showed that the functional image had a specificity of 88% and a sensitivity of 88% in the detection of a focal parenchymal defect.

To develop a management strategy for patients with unexplained fever, we studied 880 adults who were evaluated for acute fever in an emergency room. At presentation, 135 (15%) patients had unexplained fever. Occult bacterial infection was found in 48 (35%) of these 135 patients, and 21 (44%) of 48 infected patients had bacteremia. Four bacteremic patients were incorrectly discharged from the emergency room without antimicrobial therapy. Neither a ""toxic"" appearance of the patient nor an initial temperature of greater than or equal to 39.4 degrees C (103 degrees F) were predictive of occult bacterial infection. An index of predictive features was developed that included: age 50 years or older; diabetes mellitus; a white blood cell count greater than or equal to 15,000/mm3 (15 X 10(9)/L); a neutrophil band cell count greater than or equal to 1500/mm3 (1.5 X 10(9)/L); and a Wintrobe erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than or equal to 30 mm/h. In patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 or more index features present, the proportions having occult bacterial infection were 5% (1/21), 33% (15/45), 39% (15/38), and 55% (17/31), respectively. All four bacteremic patients incorrectly discharged had two or more of the index features. Adults presenting with acute unexplained fever often have life-threatening bacterial infection. A simple clinical index can be used to estimate the likelihood of occult infection and may reduce the frequency of diagnostic error."
CD009185,0,8381529,0,Comparison of planar and SPECT 99Tcm-DMSA scintigraphy for the detection of renal cortical defects in children.,"Renal cortical scintigraphy with 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid is an excellent imaging modality for the detection of renal cortical defects in children presenting with vesicoureteric reflux and urinary tract infections. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has proven increased sensitivity over planar scintigraphy for lesion detection in the heart, liver and brain. However, its role in the evaluation of renal cortical defects compared to planar scintigraphy has not been fully assessed. We wished to determine whether SPECT increases the sensitivity for detecting renal cortical defects in children compared to high-resolution planar scintigraphy. Forty-one children (90 renal units) with underlying vesicoureteric reflux and/or recently treated urinary tract infection (UTI) were evaluated. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of defects detected between a single-head SPECT system and high-resolution planar scintigraphy, 24 and 20, respectively (P = 0.54). There were four defects detected by SPECT not reported by planar scintigraphy; two of these were only seen retrospectively on planar scintigraphy. There were two children with renal cortical defects detected by SPECT and not by planar scintigraphy. All defects defected by planar scintigraphy were detected by SPECT. It is concluded that although the risk of missing renal cortical defects is low when using high-resolution, three-view planar scintigraphy, SPECT should be employed whenever feasible. Single photon emission computed tomography detected renal cortical defects in children not diagnosed by planar scintigraphy and hence patient management may be altered."

CD009185,0,2238849,0,Surgery in unilateral multicystic kidney.,"During a 15-year period 29 patients were treated for unilateral multicystic kidney. The diagnosis was obtained from antenatal ultrasonography in 17 cases, investigation of an abdominal mass at routine palpation in 10, UTI investigation in 1 and uraemia investigation in 1. Eleven patients had associated malformations. Further investigations included ultrasonography, intravenous pyelography, micturition uretrocystography and in a few cases computed tomography and Dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan. Percutaneous pyelography was performed in 9 cases. Twenty-six children were operated on and 3 were not operated, of which 1 with severe cardiac malformations, died. The age at operation was under 6 months in 14 cases and between 6 and 12 months in 8. Four children developed hypertension preoperatively but the hypertension disappeared within 1 week postoperatively in all cases. The indication for surgery in unilateral multicystic kidney seems to be clear if the patient is symptomatic. In the asymptomatic patient, the complications of a remaining multicystic kidney like hypertension, malignancy, infection and pain suggest a surgical approach at around 6 months of age."
CD009185,0,1650570,0,Single photon emission computed tomography with Tc-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid in patients with upper urinary tract infection and/or vesicoureteral reflux.,"By means of Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, an established method for assessing renal cortical damage, we evaluated the pick-up rate for renal defects (scars) by single photon computed tomography (SPECT) and planar images of 10 normal volunteers, and 58 patients (70 scintigrams) with upper urinary tract infections, most of whom had a history of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The positive study rate for renal defects depended on the severity of VUR. The overall positive rates for renal cortical defects obtained by DMSA SPECT imaging and DMSA planar imaging were 60% and 43%, respectively, and the difference between these was significant (p less than 0.005). The mean absolute individual renal uptake (/injected dose) at 2 hours post-injection was decreased in kidneys with defects detected by SPECT alone. The positive study rate for intravenous urography (IVU) depended on the grade of VUR and was 15% overall. DMSA SPECT imaging detects renal cortical defects at greater frequency than previously achieved."

CD009185,0,14768371,0,[A case of septic pulmonary embolism induced by urinary tract infection].,"A 73-year-old male in whom diabetes mellitus and benign prostatic hypertrophy had been diagnosed was hospitalized with a urinary tract infection (UTI) showing urinary retention and a high grade fever. His symptoms worsened although several antibiotics were administered after admission. A chest radiograph shows multiple nodular lesions and cavity formations in both lung fields. Arterial blood gas analysis showed hypoxia and hypocapnia. Pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy revealed perfusion defects corresponding to the nodular lesions observed on the chest radiograph. Enhanced abdominal CT demonstrated abscesses in the liver and kidney; and in urine and blood cultures, Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated. We therefore diagnosed septic pulmonary embolism (SPE) occurring secondary to UTI. After diagnosis, the patient was given intravenous imipenem/cilastatin, minocycline and ciprofloxacin, and recovered. Although SPE occurring secondary to UTI is very rare, the incidence of SPE has recently increased in patients with DM. Therefore, we should consider the possibility of SPE in patients with DM who have respiratory symptoms."

CD009185,0,16562786,0,Urinary tract infection and hyperbilirubinemia.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in newborns with asymptomatic, unexplained indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the first two weeks of life. Jaundiced infants, otherwise clinically well, less than two weeks of ages, with a total bilirubin level above 15 mg/dl were eligible for the study. A bilirubin work-up including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6 PD) level, as well as urinalysis and a urine culture were performed in all patients. Patients with UTI, defined as more than 10,000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen obtained by bladder catheterization, were evaluated for sepsis. Renal function tests and renal ultrasound were performed in cases with UTI. During follow-up, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) were performed as well. A total of 102 patients were enrolled. The bilirubin work-up of patients did not demonstrate any significant underlying disorder. None of the infants had a high direct bilirubin level. UTI was diagnosed in eight (8%) cases [Enterobacter aerogenes (3/8:38%), Enterococcus faecalis (2/8:25%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/8:25%) and Escherichia coli (1/8:12%)]. Of those eight patients, only four (50%) had pyuria. Bacteriuria was present in seven (88%) patients. The sepsis screen was negative in all but one case with a high C-reactive protein (CRP) level. None of the patients had a positive blood culture. Renal function tests were within normal levels in all patients. Renal ultrasound showed urinary tract abnormalities in three (38%) patients (hydronephrosis, n=1 and pelviectasis, n=2). VCUG was performed in all patients during the study period and one had unilateral grade 3-4 reflux, while only one patient had a diverticulum of the bladder. DMSA was performed in seven patients and none had renal scars. It is of importance that UTI can occur in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants even in the first week of life. Although it is well known that UTI is a common cause of prolonged jaundice, urine culture should be considered in the bilirubin work-up of infants older than three days of age with an unknown etiology."
CD009185,0,1327798,1,Involvement of the renal parenchyma in acute urinary tract infection: the contribution of 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid scan.,"We performed 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and ultrasonography in 146 children during the acute phase of a proven urinary tract infection (UTI). In 99 a micturating cysto-urethrography and in 83 an intravenous urography was also done. The occurrence of fever and increased WBC count, CRP and ESR were also studied. It appeared from this retrospective study that 47% of the kidneys had a cortical or patchy pattern of decreased uptake of 99mTc DMSA, as compared to 23% with abnormal findings on US. Vesico-ureteral reflux was present in 38% of the kidneys with parenchymal involvement on 99mTc DMSA scan. Although fever, leucocytosis and elevated CRP and ESR were significantly correlated with abnormal 99mTc DMSA scan, they were also observed in children without renal parenchymal involvement. Our results suggest that 99mTc DMSA scan is a sensitive method for the detection of parenchymal involvement during acute UTI. The exact nature of these lesions and their relation with scars need, however, to be defined."
CD009185,0,11523352,0,[Clinico-immunological aspects of renal lesions in rheumatoid arthritis].,"The aim of this study was to examine the incidence of different renal lesions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to determine their relationships with the type of previous drug therapy and with the specific features of immune disorders. Ninety four patients, 84 (89.9%) females and 10 (10.6%) males) with RA whose mean age was 45.2 +/- 11.9 years and duration of the disease 7.5 +/- 6.5 years were examined. Most of them had degrees 2 and 3 PA (62.7 and 24.4%, respectively). Systemic manifestations were encountered in 60 (63.8%) patients. Eighty one patients took nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) continuously: 18 patients for a year, 32 for 5 years, 14 for 6 to 10 years, and 17 for over 10 years. All the patients underwent clinical, laboratory, and instrumental study of partial functions of the kidney. Immunological study involved solid-phase immunoassay of IgA and IgM rheumatoid factor, von Willebrand factor antigens (WF:Ag), C-reactive protein. The serum concentrations were measured by the Mancini method. Changes in urinalysis and/or signs of decreased glomerular and tubular functions were found in 69 (73.%) patients, 25 (26.6%) had arterial hypertension. Tubular dysfunctions were more common [31 (32.9%) patients]. Signs of early renal failure were detected in 20 (21.2%) patients. There were no cases of acute renal failure. Amyloidosis, glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis were diagnosed in 5 (5.3%), 16 (17%), and 13 (13.8%) patients, respectively. The above renal lesions were concurrent in some patients. Renal lesion correlated with the progression and severity of RA, the presence of systemic manifestations, and age. There was no relationship of both 5- and 10-year use of NSAID to the symptoms of renal disease. The use of these drugs for over 10 years was concurrent with the signs of chronic renal failure and arterial hypertension. Analyzing immunological disorders showed an association of increased erythrocytic sedimentation rates and WF:Ag with amyloidosis, that of higher IgA concentrations with proteinuria and tubular dysfunctions. It is concluded that renal lesion is common in RA, there is a predominance of tubular interstitial changes. In rare cases nephropathy is characterized by a benign course and fails to result in uremia. The symptoms of renal diseases are largely associated with RA progression and severity and the patients' age. Prolonged continuous use of NSAID may contribute to the development of renal failure. Different immune mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of glomerular and tubular nephropathy in RA."
CD009185,0,9608142,0,[Ten years of prenatal diagnosis of uropathies. Study and conclusions].,"Since uropathy started to be diagnosed by means of ultrasonography during the prenatal period, paediatric urologists have experienced a major increase in neonatal consultations, which involve healthy children without any symptoms of urinary tract infection. Thereby the criteria for an adequate treatment of these uropathies have been modified. With our study, we intend to analyse the changes regarding the management of such cases in our Service for the last 10 years. 294 cases prenatally diagnosed and confirmed by means of postnatal sonography have been reviewed, taking into account the type of explorations carried out in order to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Ultrasonography, cystourethrography, pyelography, scintigraphy and isotopic renography have determined both degree of obstruction and the renal function of the patient so as to value the kidney viability. We have found 169 cases of pelviureteral junction (PUJ) obstruction, 52 of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), 48 of megaureter, 13 of ureterocele, 8 of ectopic ureter, 5 of urethral valves, 26 of multicystic dysplasic kidney, 35 of renal duplication, 4 of renal cyst, 2 of ectopic kidney, 2 of renal agenesia, 3 of bladder diverticular, 1 of renal hypoplasia and 1 of Bolande's tumour. 32 children were operated upon due to PUJ obstruction, 27 due to VUR, 14 megaureter, 21 due to ureterocele and ectopic ureter, 5 due to valves, 5 multicystic kidneys, 3 vesical diverticula, 2 renal cysts and 1 due to Bolande's tumour. From a total of 367 diagnoses, 109 patients have undergone an operation, which equals a 29.7%. The rest of the patients have been subject to a medical follow-up. Only 3 patients had to be operated on due to an aggravation of their obstruction. To sum up, the main advantage of prenatal diagnosis is that it presents the patient without urinary infection. Double-diuretic scintigraphy has proved to be the best option to explore the obstruction when dilated despite its limitations in the case of deficient renal function. The most frequent diagnosis, which has undergone a major increase in the last few years, is PUJ obstruction in the manner of pyelic dilatation. Many of them are not confirmed postnatally and most of them (more than 70%) do not need surgical treatment."

CD009185,0,2658022,0,Bacterial adhesion as an indicator of renal involvement in bacteriuria of pregnancy.,"The association of bacterial virulence with the host response to bacteriuria was evaluated in 70 pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis or bacteriuria detected at screening. Patients infected with Escherichia coli attaching to Gal alpha 1----4Gal beta-containing receptors, had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein and lower renal concentrating capacity than patients infected with strains lacking this specificity. The renal concentrating capacity ranged from 419-1151 mOsm/kg in the women with bacteriuria on screening. 5/11 women with a renal concentrating capacity less than or equal to 784 mOsm/kg were infected with Gal alpha 1----4Gal beta-specific bacteria, compared to 0/16 of patients who concentrated the urine greater than 784 mOsm/kg. According to earlier studies the risk for progression to pyelonephritis and recurrences during pregnancy was increased in bacteriuric women with a reduced renal concentrating capacity. The present study demonstrates that this risk group can be identified in part by the properties of the infecting E. coli strains."
CD009185,0,19112220,0,Evaluating kidney damage from vesico-ureteral reflux in children.,"To review the most relevant clinical studies that evaluate kidney damage in children with primary vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR), we reviewed and compared randomized controlled trials and clinical trials from scientific literature. In these studies, vesico-ureteral reflux was diagnosed by voiding cystourethrogram and kidney damage was assessed by either DMSA scan or urography. Relative risk with 95% confidence intervals was calculated using Review Manager Software (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2000). The overall relative risk of kidney damage shown by DMSA scan and urography was statistically higher in children with vesico-ureteral reflux of various degrees than in controls (3.7 times and 2.8 times, respectively). However, in high-grade VUR, the relative risk of congenital kidney damage was 5.6 times that of controls. We conclude that severe VUR is frequently associated with early kidney damage, perhaps with prenatal onset. Progression of kidney damage may depend on the severity of VUR and untreated urinary tract infections. Prevention of congenital kidney damage from severe VUR is possible when there is early intervention, even during fetal growth."

CD009185,0,9759320,0,[Role of DMSA scintigraphy in managing pediatric pyelonephritis].,"Pyelonephritis in children may lead to irreversible renal damage and eventually to arterial hypertension and renal insufficiency. Inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy permits detection of acute renal lesions and renal scars with high sensitivity and specificity. In our experience 60% of patients who had acute renal lesions on DMSA scintigraphy during pyelonephritis develop scars. Young age appears to be not a risk factor, as in our experience 70% of children older than 5 years develop scars compared to 40% for children younger than 1 year. In addition, only 40% of patients who develop scars have vesicoureteral reflux. DMSA scintigraphy may provide answers to important clinical questions: what is the optimal length of treatment of pyelonephritis? Is parenteral treatment necessary? What is the best treatment of vesicoureteral reflux? DMSA scintigraphy permits therapeutical decision-making according to the renal involvement in each of our patients."

CD009185,0,6289457,0,Nuclear medicine in acute and chronic renal failure.,"The diagnostic value of renal scintiscans in patients with acute or chronic renal failure has not been emphasized other than for the estimation of renal size. 131I OIH, 67gallium, 99mTcDTPA, glucoheptonate and DMSA all may be valuable in a variety of specific settings. Acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, acute interstitial nephritis, cortical necrosis, renal artery embolism, or acute pyelonephritis may be recognized. Data useful in the diagnosis and management of the patient with obstructive or reflux nephropathy may be obtained. Radionuclide studies in patients with chronic renal failure may help make apparent such causes as renal artery stenosis, chronic pyelonephritis or lymphomatous kidney infiltration. Future correlation of scanning results with renal pathology promises to further expand nuclear medicine's utility in the noninvasive diagnosis of renal disease."
CD009185,0,6289456,0,Radionuclides in the evaluation of urinary obstruction.,"Radionuclide renography and renal scanning techniques are ideally suited to the initial and follow-up evaluation of patients with obstructive uropathy. While other modalities are superior in their ability to provide anatomic information, the radionuclide study yields functional information for each kidney without the necessity to resort to invasive studies. In addition, the Nuclear Medicine study is well suited to the evaluation of obstruction where serial studies often are required because of a lower radiation burden compared to urography. This lower radiation dose is especially important in obstruction because of the recurrent nature of several kinds of obstructive uropathy and because of the high incidence in the pediatric age group. The ability to control urine flow rate during the procedure through dehydration or administration of diuretics is an additional benefit. Increasing availability of computerization of nuclear medicine procedures as well as interest in studies employing physiologic intervention (including the diuresis renogram) have assured an important place for radionuclide studies in the evaluation of patients with urinary obstruction."
CD009185,0,6289455,0,Nuclear renal imaging in acute pyelonephritis.,"Patients with acute pyelonephritis may present with a spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms. There are few noninvasive diagnostic studies, however, to confirm or exclude this diagnosis. A small number of patients, generally those with severe disease, will demonstrate radiographic changes on excretory urography, but the lack of sensitivity of the IVP in early, acute pyelonephritis is well documented. Several radionuclide techniques have been proposed to assist in the earlier detection of this clinical problem including imaging with Mercury-197 chlormerodrin, Gallium-67 citrate, Technetium-99m glucoheptonate. Technetium-99m DMSA, and, more recently, Indium-111 labeled white blood cells. The success of the renal cortical imaging agents as well as those which localize in infection are described in this report. There appears to be a complimentary role or the cortical imaging agents and the radiopharmaceuticals which localize in bacterial infection. Cortical agents offer the advantage of specific assessment of functioning renal tissue and a convenient, rapid method for following the response to treatment in a noninvasive manner. A pattern is described which may be diagnostic; correlation with Gallium-67 citrate of Indium-111 WBCs may increase the probability of infection as the cause for the cortical abnormality. The measurement of differential renal function using cortical agents provides additional information to assist the clinician in predicting the late effects of infection. Improved sensitivity and specificity, and a reproducible method for following the response to therapy in patients with acute pyelonephritis are the advantages of the techniques described."

A pair of monozygotic siblings is described exhibiting a remarkably parallel clinical course. VUR grade II was diagnosed in girl A during urinary tract infection at the age of 2 yr; screening of her asymptomatic sister (girl B) revealed the same. Renal cortical scintigraphy unveiled unilateral hypo-dysplasia in both the twins. Despite trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, infection recurred in girl A after 7 months, while girl B had a first episode 2 months later that prompted regimen switch to nitrofurantoin. Follow-up at the age of 4 depicted bilateral reflux deterioration; an urodynamics study that followed revealed functional bladder instability in both girls and the oral antispasmodic oxybutynin was initiated with good results. Evaluation for reflux should be prompt in infants with urinary infection. Patient siblings display a higher relative reflux risk, being highest in identical twins. Heredity issues, the impact of age and dysfunctional voiding in the clinical course, and the contribution of nuclear medicine in VUR management are discussed."
CD009185,0,17115277,0,Immunological evaluation of urinary trypsin inhibitors in blood and urine: role of N- & O-linked glycoproteins.,"Urinary trypsin inhibitors (uTi) suppress serine proteases during inflammation. After liberation from proinhibitors (P-alpha-I and I-alpha-I) by the white blood cell (WBC) response, uTi readily pass through the kidneys into urine. A key uTi, bikunin, is attached to O-linked and N-linked glycoconjugates. Recently, uTi inhibitors, called uristatins, were found to lack the O-linked glycoconjugates. Monoclonal antibodies were produced using purified uristatin and screened for binding differences to uristatin, bikunin, P-alpha-I, and I-alpha-I. Antibody-binding patterns were characterized using immunoaffinity binding onto protein-chip surfaces and analysis by Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization mass spectrometry (SELDI), using specimens from patients and from purified uTi standards. Antibodies were developed and used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for uTi measurement in urine and plasma specimens. ELISA was performed on specimens from normal, presumed healthy, controls and from patients who had been screened for inflammation using a high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) test and a complete blood count (CBC). Polyclonal antibody against uTi showed cross-reactivity with the Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) and with proinhibitors. Screening of anti-uTi monoclonal antibodies (Mab) revealed antibodies that did not cross-react with either of the above, thus providing a tool to measure both uristatin and bikunin in urine with Mab 3G5 and in plasma with Mab 5D11. The monoclonal antibody 5D11 cross-reacts with specific N-linked glycoconjugates of uristatin present in plasma. In ca 96% of healthy adults, uTi were present at <12 mg/l in urine and <4 mg/l in plasma. We also found that patients with an inflammation and a CRP of >2.0 mg/l had higher urinary concentrations of uTi than the control population in every subject. Free uristatin and bikunin pass readily into urine and are primarily bound to heavy chains that constitute the proinhibitor form in plasma."

We followed up on the time course of serum nitrate levels in 51 hospitalized patients aged between 34 and 81 years. Four groups were defined: patients with SBP (group 1, n = 14), patients with bacteremia (group 2, n = 11), patients with urinary tract infection (group 3, n = 11) and patients in a stable clinical condition (group 4, n = 20). The four groups did not differ in terms of Pugh score (11 +/- 1, 10 +/- 1, 11 +/- 1, and 10 +/- 1, respectively). Serum nitrate levels averaged 31 +/- 2 micromol/L in group 4 (84 samples). On the day results of cytobacteriological examination were positive, mean serum nitrate levels were 75 +/- 17, 63 +/- 9, and 36 +/- 9 micromol/L, respectively, in groups 1 (17 cases), 2 (11 cases), and 3 (11 cases) (P < .001). The maximum nitrate values recorded during follow-up were higher in groups 1 (149 +/- 15 micromol/L) and 2 (112 +/- 11 micromol/L) than in group 3 (66 +/- 7 micromol/L; P < .001 and < .01, respectively). These maximum values were recorded in all groups approximately 2 weeks after the infection was diagnosed. The mean duration of NO overproduction, as defined by nitrate level (3)90 micromol/L, was 15 +/- 3 days in group 1 and 5 +/- 1 day in group 2. When the nitrate concentration was studied in serum and ascitic fluid sampled on the same day, it was found to be higher in ascitic fluid than in serum in eight cases of SBP in the period preceding the peak serum nitrate concentration (100 +/- 17 vs. 63 +/- 14 micromol/L; P < .001).

CD009185,0,22569440,0,Predisposing factors for renal scarring in children with urinary tract infection.,"This study was undertaken to determine the predisposing factors for renal scarring in children with urinary tract infection. In this prospective cohort study, 176 children with documented urinary tract infection were categorized into four groups: ≤1 year old, 1-2 years old, 2-7 years and 7-14 years old. Ultrasonography and Technetium-99 m-DMSA scan were used to detect the possible abnormalities. Infants under 12 months old presented as the most common group for renal scarring (27 cases, 52.9%), and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was diagnosed in 29 cases (56.8%). Fifteen (41.67%) children between the ages of one and two years had renal scar, and VUR was detected in half of the patients. In the third group, 36.3%, and in fourth group, 41.6% of the patients had renal scar. Also, 38.6% in group three and 50% in the final group had VUR. A co-incidental finding that was observed in this study was the high incidence of pseudohypoaldesteronism (PHA) in our patients: in 39.2% of the children in group one, 22.2% in group two and 4% in group three. In group four however, none of the patients had PHA. Risk of scar formation with urinary tract infection (UTI) was higher in the younger age group and in those with recurrent UTIs."
CD009185,0,20174781,0,[Upper abdominal pain with recurrent cholangitis and pyelonephritis].,"A 38-year-old man presented with pain in the right upper abdomen combined with elevated C-reactive protein (5.37 mg/dl) and creatinine levels (2.0 mg/dl). The medical history revealed recurrent abdominal pain. Duplex sonography showed large intrahepatic cystic structures, partially combined with a ribbon-shaped flow signal inside, as well as multiple cysts in the kidneys. The following MRI identified these findings as dilatated bile ducts surrounding the portal vein branches. This is known as the central dot sign. Overall, this special constellation is indicative of Caroli's disease, a rare congenital cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The imaging results substantiated the diagnosis, especially in combination with cystic renal disease and recurrent cholangitis. Depending on the grade of liver involvement the treatment is partial hepatectomy or, as in our case transplantation, which also eliminates the risk of associated cholangiocarcinoma."
CD009185,0,8176559,0,Congenital renal damage associated with primary vesicoureteral reflux detected prenatally in male infants.,"To assess the course of vesicoureteral reflux, we performed cystography, renal scintigraphy, and urography in all neonates with the prenatal diagnosis of renal pelvic dilation and revealed the presence of primary reflux (grades I to V) in 27 cases. Higher grades of reflux were associated with congenital renal damage, as shown by reduced tracer uptake during scintigraphy. Reflux was diagnosed more frequently in male infants (male/female ratio, 6:1), in many of whom bladder abnormalities were found by cystography. In another group of seven infants, in whom the reflux was associated with other urologic abnormalities, there was no sex prevalence. We conclude that severe primary reflux associated with hydronephrosis usually affects male infants and may be due to abnormal embryologic development of the male urethra, and that the kidney damage is primary and not the result of urinary tract infections. This pattern differs from that of vesicoureteric reflux diagnosed at an older age, which is observed most commonly in female patients."

CD009185,0,3900621,0,[Radionuclide evaluation of the function of the operated kidneys].,"Altogether 68 patients were examined in early and late periods after operations on the kidneys. Function of the operated kidney was checked up by the results of two-indicator renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-DTPA and 131I-hippuran. When the kidney preserved its secretory capability and the suppression of organ function was caused by inhibited urine passage via the upper urinary tract, therapy aimed at the restoration of the kidney integrity and the elimination of the urine discharge obstruction, resulted in a rapid and complete recovery of all renal functions. Operative treatment of prolonged urological diseases complicated by chronic pyelonephritis, helped to accelerate secretory-excretory processes and slightly improved function of unchanged nephrons. A progressive decrease in the actively functioning parenchyma was recorded on scintigrams in 28% of the cases of the formation of the arteriosclerotic kidney. The authors found radionuclide investigations appropriate in the postoperative period not only in the development of complications and recurrences of urological diseases. Two-indicator renal scintigraphy with glomerulotropic and tubulotropic radiopharmaceuticals made it possible to give an objective assessment of the efficacy of surgical intervention."

Their design and conduct were based on recommended statistical techniques, now generally accepted as the most appropriate approach to the assessment of antischistosomal drugs.Randomization produced comparable host groups in whom multiple parasitic infection and radiological urinary tract damage were common. Treatment was with one of three antimonial compounds given at equivalent metallic dosage daily.Antimony sodium tartrate (AST) and antimony dimercaptosuccinate (TWSb) were equally efficient curatively but both produced many side-effects. Sodium antimonylgluconate (TSAG) was four-fifths as effective but tolerance was superior. Estimations of urinary antimony excretion showed that tissue retention of the metal was related to cure-rates and side-effects. It was concluded that none of the drugs were suitable for mass chemotherapy.More new non-toxic schistosomicides are urgently needed and for their assessment, the setting-up of multicentre trials, following international agreement on technical methods, is suggested."
CD009185,0,12671842,0,Inflammation in ESRD: causes and potential consequences.,"Malnutrition in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is characterized by hypoalbuminemia, decreased serum creatinine and prealbumin, and decreased subjective global assessment (SGA) scores. Markers of malnutrition predict mortality and correlate closely with inflammatory markers, including serum cytokines and acute phase proteins. After multiple regression analysis, markers of inflammation become stronger predictors of mortality than nutritional markers, suggesting that malnutrition is a result of inflammation. The etiology of inflammation is variable and includes vascular access infection, bioincompatible dialyzers, back filtration of nonsterile dialysate, periodontal disease, urinary tract infections, and other pyogenic infections. Renal failure also may serve to promote inflammation through protein carbonylation. Differences in care patterns of ESRD patients and genetics may contribute to inflammation as evidenced by lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in Asian populations. Inflammation results in loss of muscle mass and hypoalbuminemia as a consequence of its decreased synthesis and increased catabolism. Vascular disease occurs partly because of changes in lipoprotein structure and function, including oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and modification of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by serum amyloid A (SAA) and loss of apolipoprotein A-I. Leukocyte adhesion is promoted by changes in endothelial structure and function, whereas plasma proteins associated with cardiovascular disease (fibrinogen, lipoprotein[a]; SAA) are increased. Consequences of inflammation in ESRD patients include muscle wasting, erythropoetin resistance, and vascular disease. Whereas improvements in nutrition can increase serum albumin and creatinine levels, identification and removal of the underlying cause of inflammation should be one treatment goal."
CD009185,0,21159351,0,Host response to porcine strains of Escherichia coli in a novel pyelonephritis model.,"The initial pathology and pathogenesis of pyelonephritis and the influence of different strains of Escherichia coli were investigated in a novel porcine model. Nine female pigs were divided into three groups (A, B and C) and inoculated repeatedly into one renal pelvis with porcine pyelonephritis E. coli strain LK67 (P fimbriae PapG(I)), LK76 (type 1 fimbriae) or LK82 (type 1 fimbriae and P fimbriae PapG(II/III)), respectively. The contralateral kidneys were inoculated with saline and served as controls. Pigs were killed 6h post-inoculation (hpi). Differential leucocyte counts, serum biochemical analyses and measurement of serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins were carried out at 0, 3 and 6 hpi. Bacteriological evaluation of urine, kidneys, spleen, liver, abdominal swabs and blood samples and gross and histopathological evaluation of kidneys, renal lymph nodes, liver and spleen were performed by quantitative, semiquantitative and/or descriptive methods. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify cells expressing L1 antigen, CD3ɛ, CD4, CD8, CD79αcy and lysozyme, and to identify E. coli and Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP). E. coli was re-isolated from all inoculated kidneys. Gross and microscopical lesions of acute pyelonephritis were demonstrated in all but one kidney inoculated with E. coli, but in none of the control kidneys. Renal parenchymal infiltration with both neutrophils and mononuclear cells, primarily CD3+ T lymphocytes, was observed at 6 hpi. Most T lymphocytes were CD8+. Pigs in group C had the highest mean pathology scores. Neutrophils were the dominant renal leucocyte in this group, while the number of mononuclear cells was at least equal to the number of neutrophils in the lesions of pigs from groups A and B. Kidneys with a high number of E. coli had severe lesions. Systemic spread of E. coli was observed in five pigs. THP was observed interstitially in 89% of the E. coli-inoculated kidneys. In all groups, increased numbers of neutrophils and decreased numbers of lymphocytes and monocytes were shown by differential leucocyte count at 6 hpi, and from 3 to 6 hpi there was a significant increase in C-reactive protein concentration."

The rarity and subtle clinical presentation of this condition, the presence of pre-existing degenerative arthritic changes, and delayed appearance of radiologic signs of progression to destructive osteomyelitis contributed to a significant delay in diagnosis. Increased awareness of vertebral osteomyelitis as a clinical entity combined with information from radionuclide scanning may permit earlier detection of this condition."
CD009185,0,2846898,0,Evaluation of 99mtechnetium-dimercapto-succinic acid renal scans in experimental acute pyelonephritis in piglets.,"We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of 99mtechnetium-dimercapto-succinic acid renal scans in the detection and localization of experimental acute pyelonephritis in piglets. To create pyelonephritis vesicoureteral reflux of infected urine was surgically induced in 22 piglets. Nine animals were evaluated with a dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan at 1 week and 13 at 2 weeks. Autopsy and histopathological examination of the kidneys were performed subsequently. The location and extent of the inflammatory response found on histopathological examination were compared to dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan findings in a blinded fashion. Of the 22 kidneys subjected to vesicoureteral reflux 15 had positive histopathological findings of acute pyelonephritis, including 13 detected by the dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan findings. The 2 kidneys in which inflammation was not detected had only minimal grade I lesions and were grossly normal. There were no false positive scans in any of these kidneys. The sensitivity of the scan for detection of acute pyelonephritis in the kidneys subjected to reflux was 87 per cent and the specificity was 100 per cent. Furthermore, in these same kidneys the dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan findings correctly predicted the presence or absence of individual pyelonephritic lesions in 62 of 66 poles for an over-all agreement rate of 94 per cent. Thus, dimercapto-succinic acid renal cortical imaging is a highly sensitive and reliable imaging modality to detect and localize experimental acute pyelonephritis in piglets."

The clearance was calculated by means of either the simplified second exponential method or the 120-min single blood sample; Chantler's correction was used in order to correct for having neglected the first exponential. There was a progressive increase in clearance from the first weeks of life (mean value around 1 month: 55 ml/min/1.73 m2), with a plateau at around 18 months. Between 2 and 17 years of age, the clearance values remained constant, with a mean value of 114 ml/min/1.73 m2 (SD: 24 ml/min); this is similar to the level described for inulin clearance. No significant differences were observed between boys and girls, or between clearance values calculated with one or with two blood samples. Taking into account the hour of intravenous injection of the tracer, we did not observe any influence of the lunchtime meal on the distribution of the 51Cr-EDTA clearance values."
CD009185,0,21170664,0,Hepatic and pulmonary nodular lesions in pediatric urinary tract infections.,"One of the major goals in investigating children with urinary tract infection (UTI) is to recognize patients at risk of further UTI-related problems. This study reports the clinical features of 19 pediatric patients with UTIs in whom associated hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules were incidentally diagnosed by the imaging tests performed for the UTI. Hepatic nodules in five patients were detected on ultrasound scans, and pulmonary nodules and both hepatic and pulmonary nodules were detected in 12 and two children by dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. The mean age of the patients was 24.5 months. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was detected in nine of 17 patients (52.9%), acute pyelonephritis was identified in nine of 18 patients, and renal scarring was found in 57.1% patients with pyelonephritis. On follow-up, the hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules regressed in all patients. About 85.7% of patients experienced a recurrence of UTI within 1 year. In comparison with age- and sex-matched controls with UTIs without pulmonary or hepatic nodules, the presence of VUR and the recurrence of UTI within 1 year were higher in patients with UTIs and nodules (P<0.05). The hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules identified on the ultrasound scan and by dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy may provide a valuable diagnostic marker for the proper management of patients with an UTI."
CD009185,0,21519371,0,Emphysematous cystitis in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"A 62-year-old woman with a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus was admitted to our hospital with a 3-week history of mild fever, vomiting, and anorexia. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral hydronephrosis and gas accumulation in the urinary bladder wall and left ureter. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein level. Urine culture showed heavy growth of Escherichia coli. The final diagnosis was emphysematous cystitis. The patient was treated with systemic antibiotics and drainage using a urethral catheter. The clinical and radiographic findings resolved rapidly, and she was discharged from the hospital on day 28. Emphysematous cystitis is a relatively rare urinary tract infection associated with gas formation, and has the potential for a serious outcome if untreated.

To avoid the exposure to unnecessary and injurious x-rays, the authors propose patient selection based on the presence or absence of distal ureteral dilatation and on the time elapsed between typical or atypical symptoms of u.t.i. and fever. First of all, it is essential to diagnose pielonephritis. After ultrasound and radionuclide scintigram with DMSA they select the infants who need cystourethrography.

The diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux was made significantly earlier in boys than in girls regardless of reflux grade (p < 0.001). At entry reflux nephropathy was present on a dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in 44% of 314 refluxing kidneys. There was no significant difference between boys and girls in the prevalence of reflux nephropathy. The renal lesions were more severe in boys independently of the grade of vesicoureteral reflux (p < 0.05). Breakthrough urinary tract infection was significantly more common in girls than in boys, regardless of vesicoureteral reflux grade (p < 0.05). Mean followup was 68.7 +/- 31.2 months. Patient age at the time of the first of 2 radionuclide cystograms without vesicoureteral reflux was considered the age of spontaneous resolution of reflux. Using life table estimations and analyzing data stratified to sex and grade of vesicoureteral reflux, we found that although reflux lasted longer in boys compared to girls, this difference was not statistically significant. During followup new scars developed in 7 patients related to breakthrough urinary tract infection. There was no significant difference between boys and girls in the development of new scars.

All dogs were intact at the time of diagnosis or for the majority of their lives and three were male. Various diagnostic procedures were performed including ultrasonography, contrast radiography, and nuclear scintigraphy. Not all procedures were performed in all patients. Findings included ureteral dilation proximal to the level of an intraluminal mass and ipsilateral hydronephrosis. Unilateral ureteronephrectomy was performed in three dogs with masses in the proximal ureter; ureteral resection and anastamosis was performed in the remaining patient with a mass located in the distal ureter. The same pathologist (RAP) reviewed all four lesions. The lesions appeared polypoid and were attached to the ureteral wall by a thin stalk. Histopathologically, they contained a superficial layer of well-differentiated transitional epithelial cells overlying a prominent fibrovascular stroma with a mild (three dogs) or marked (one dog) degree of lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. This disease may represent a benign neoplasm or a chronic inflammatory reaction and has a good prognosis with surgical removal. Its histopathological characteristics, higher incidence in males, and location more commonly within the upper third of the ureter is remarkably similar to the disease in humans."

The examination is methodically simply to be performed and is of little stress for the patient. Therefore it seems to be suitable for the routine examination."
CD009185,0,19593590,1,The efficacy of ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in predicting vesicoureteral reflux in children below the age of 2 years with their first febrile urinary tract infection.,"We evaluated the efficacy of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and ultrasound (US) in comparison with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in predicting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children below the age of 2 years. Medical records and radiologic studies of children (<2 years) suffering their first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) between January 2001 and May 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of US and DMSA scans in diagnosing VUR. Among 220 children with their first febrile UTI, VUR was detected in 67 (30.4%). The detection rate of VUR by US was 41.7% and 86% in the low (I, II) and high grade (III~IV) groups, respectively. Detection rate of VUR by DMSA scan was 37.5% and 88.4% in the low and high grade groups, respectively. Combining US and DMSA scan, we found that the detection rate of high grade VUR was 95.3% and that of low grade was 62.5%. During follow up, most of the low grade VURs with normal DMSA and US scans resolved or were downgraded. Most high grade VURs could be detected by US and DMSA scan, but the prediction rate was not as high in low grade VURs. However, we can anticipate spontaneous improvement without complications in patients with either low or high grade reflux and negative findings on US and DMSA scan."
CD009185,0,3765885,0,[Comparative results of ileal conduit and colonic conduit. Analysis of 50 children with bladder exstrophy].,"During the last 20 years 50 children with exstrophy of the bladder were treated in the Department of Paediatric Surgery of the Children's Hospital of Cologne employing besides other surgical methods such as primary closure, ureterosigmoideostomy, ureterocutaneostomy etc., in 15 cases an ileal conduit and in 12 cases a colonic conduit. These children could be followed up on the average 8.5 or 3 years after the operation, clinically, roentgenologically and in some cases via scintigraphy. Late complications requiring surgical correction, such as stomatostenoses, conduit elongation, stenoses of the ureterointestinal anastomosis, calculus formation in the conduit, or complications like ureteral reflux, recurring infections of the urinary passages with pyelonephritis, occurred only with ileal conduits, whereas no late complications requiring surgery were seen with the colonic conduits. Similar results in respect of late complications were found among the patients in Munich from 1955 to 1983 with 35 exstrophies of the bladder (13 ileal conduits, 1 colonic conduit) in which additionally an adeno-carcinoma was seen after ureterosigmoideostomy with fatal outcome. Hence, we are of the opinion that the method of choice is the preparation of a colonic conduit in patients with exstrophy of the bladder where primary closure is not possible because the bladder lamina is too small or already epithelialised. This approach offers the safest possible long-term protection of the primary normally positioned upper urinary tract."

The incidence of community-acquired infection due to such bacteria is increasing, but few cases of infant upper urinary tract infection (UUTI) have been reported in Japan. We treated four infants with UUTI caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, as determined by genotyping. Using medical records, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical course, antibiotic use and efficacy, antimicrobial susceptibility results, and the presence of underlying disease. One of the four had been previously hospitalized for occult bacteremia. Two developed UUTI after antibiotic treatment, indicating that previous antibiotic use may have been a risk factor in these cases. We could not identify the infection route in all cases. Two of the four had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Renal scintigraphy was done in three. Although an initial dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) defect was detected in all four, only one had renal scarring. E. coli isolates from all four showed PCR signals for blaCTX-M-; one isolate positive for the blaCTX-M3 group and three positive for blaCTX-M14. Antimicrobial susceptibility test results showed all isolates to be resistant to cephalosporins, but discrepancies existed between antimicrobial susceptibility results and actual clinical efficacy. Clinically, cefazolin (CEZ) was effective in two subjects and ceftazidime (CAZ) effective in one. Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) was effective in one. None of the four developed sepsis or meningitis. Post hospitalization antibiotic prophylaxis showed that none of the four has had UUTI recur. Japan's ESBL-producing bacterial infection incidence is increasing, so medical professionals should watch for such UUTI even in first-case occurrence in infants."

In order to study foetal VUR and its consequences, newborns with foetal hydronephrosis were investigated by ultrasound, micturating cystourethrogram and 99mTechnetium-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA), after beginning of chemoprophylaxis. Twenty-eight infants with VUR (bilateral in 15 cases) were identified giving a total 43 renal units for study. There was a predominance of males (86%), moderate/severe reflux (84%) and renal damage (51%). Presence of renal damage was correlated with the severity of reflux. VUR should be investigated in cases of foetal hydronephrosis and our results support that renal damage is frequently congenital and not secondary to urinary tract infection."

Procalcitonin is moderately increased in local bacterial infection (pneumonia pyelonephritis) and is unchanged in viral infections or bacterial colonization. Procalcitonin is increased in serious bacterial infections in neonates, children and adults and is currently the best diagnostic marker of severe bacterial infection, being better than leukocyte, interleukin or C-reactive protein counts. C-reactive protein levels can be normal in severe sepsis and some viral infections. We studied 54 children with sepsis in whom plasma procalcitonin levels showed a positive correlation with the vasoactive drugs necessary to maintain cardiovascular activity.

Only 30% of the 116 patients had a history referable to earlier urinary tract infection and there were remarkably few girls with an increased sedimentation rate (4.4%), C-reactive protein (9.5%), pyuria (25.8%) or lowered concentrating capacity (3.4%) at the time of detection of their bacteriuria. No method was found efficient in predicting lesions on the pyelogram and urethrocystogram, but determination of renal concentrating capacity and C-reactive protein was of some value in predicting parenchymal reduction. The girls with pyelonephritic changes on the pyelogram had a mean renal concentrating capacity significantly lower than the girls without changes. The concentrating capacity of the girls with reflux but without renal scarring and those bacteriuric patients without radiologically demonstrated defects did not differ significantly from the age-related normal values."
CD009185,0,3184292,0,Optimal use of 99mtechnetium-glucoheptonate scintigraphy in the detection of pyelonephritic scarring in children: a preliminary report.,"Renal scintigraphy represents the optimal modality for the detection of renal scars. 99mTechnetium-glucoheptonate is rapidly accumulated by the kidney through glomerular filtration and active transport by renal tubular cells. This permits rapid visualization of the renal parenchyma in the early phase (1 to 3-minute images) and subsequent imaging of the collecting system and ureters. About 10 to 15 per cent of the injected activity remains in the kidney, labeling the cells of the proximal convoluted tubules (late phase or 1 to 2-hour images). The late phase has been used more commonly to assess renal parenchymal damage. Early and late phase glucoheptonate scanning was performed in 42 children as part of the evaluation of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections with or without a history of vesicoureteral reflux. Inter-observer reliability to interpret glucoheptonate scans was good (early, 83 per cent agreement and late, 93 per cent agreement). The ability of glucoheptonate scanning to detect renal scarring in children with febrile urinary tract infections was equivalent with the early or late phase of the study. In 6 patients renal scarring was detected on only the early phase scan and in 7 scarring was detected only in the late phase. Although the detection rates are equivalent the over-all detection of scarring is improved by using both phases. Therefore, the early phase of the glucoheptonate scan may be a valuable adjunct to conventional glucoheptonate scan methodology used for the detection of renal scarring in children with recurrent urinary tract infections."

The prevalence rate is hazardous since data from the literature are confusing with respect to reflux nephropathy, chronic pyelonephritis and renal hypoplasia. The pathology of such lesions consists in focal interstitial fibrosis. When the first pyelonephritic attack occurs during infancy, renal growth may be compromised. The current approach of renal scar assessment is based on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Bilateral extensive lesions may be responsible for altered glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and/or arterial hypertension. The management of overt scarring is conservative and careful prevention must be based on early and aggressive treatment of acute pyelonephritis."

Evaluation of the child with urinary tract infection and identification of those at risk for infection are of paramount importance. With early diagnosis and early institution of proper therapy, the likelihood of renal scarring can be significantly reduced, and thus outcome can be improved. This review points to the controversies surrounding the ability to accurately distinguish between upper and lower tract urinary infection, and whether this distinction is important in the care of the child with urinary infection. Vesicoureteric reflux as a risk factor is discussed. Ultrasound examination and voiding cystourethrogram or radionuclide cystogram are generally recommended for evaluating the lower urinary tract of infants and preschool children who have urinary tract infection. The role of dimercaptosuccinic acid scanning in evaluating the upper tract is debated."

Urine samples from 40 children with acute pyelonephritis, 16 children at 6-wk follow-up and 15 children with nonrenal fever were analyzed using ELISA. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were compared with the outcome of pyelonephritis as measured by renal static scintigraphy. A mouse model of acute ascending pyelonephritis was used to localize the sites of production and the kinetics of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Human renal epithelial A498 cells, primary mesangial cells and monocytic THP-1 cells were stimulated by Escherichia coli. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and protein production by ELISA. We demonstrate a significant increase of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the urine of children with acute pyelonephritis. Both proteins were produced mainly by leukocytes, and TIMP-1 also by resident kidney cells. Cells reacted differently after stimulation by bacteria. In mesangial cells and monocytes a decreased constitutive TIMP-1 production was found, which was in contrast to epithelial cells. Out of 40 children with pyelonephritis, 23 had higher urinary TIMP-1 than MMP-9 levels. These children had significantly more severe changes in both acute and follow-up scintigraphy scans indicating higher degree of acute tissue damage and renal scarring. Thus, our findings suggest an association between TIMP-1 and the process of renal scarring."
CD009185,0,8021985,0,The selective use of dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans in children with vesicoureteral reflux.,"Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans were performed on 75 children (115 refluxing renal units) to determine the efficacy of routine scanning in patients with various grades of vesicoureteral reflux. Cystourethrography demonstrated grades I and II reflux in 75 renal units and grades III to V in 40. Of the patients 51 presented with febrile urinary tract infection and 24 were asymptomatic (patients presenting with nonfebrile urinary tract infections or those undergoing sibling screening). Renal ultrasounds were performed in 60 patients. All patients were initially managed with medical therapy and 19 (25%) ultimately underwent antireflux surgery. DMSA scans demonstrated scarring in 17 of 40 renal units (43%) of patients with high grade vesicoureteral reflux and 6 of 75 renal units (8%) of those with low grade reflux. Renal ultrasounds that were interpreted as normal always correlated to a normal DMSA scan in asymptomatic patients. In patients presenting with febrile urinary tract infections the correlation between ultrasound and DMSA scan was inconsistent. We advocate a tailored approach in the evaluation of patients with vesicoureteral reflux. Renal sonography may be sufficient in the assessment of renal scarring in asymptomatic patients with reflux and those with low grade reflux. Conversely, in patients with high grade vesicoureteral reflux, a history of febrile urinary tract infections and abnormal renal ultrasound DMSA renal scans appear to be most useful."
CD009185,0,21561990,0,Role of C-reactive protein velocity in the diagnosis of early bacterial infections in children after cardiac surgery.,"Fever after cardiac surgery in children may be due to bacterial infection or noninfectious origin like systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) secondary to bypass procedure. A marker to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial fever in these conditions is clinically important. The purpose of our study was to evaluate, in the early postcardiac surgery period, whether serial measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) and its change over time (CRP velocity) can assist in detecting bacterial infection. A series of consecutive children who underwent cardiac surgery with bypass were tested for serum levels of CRP at several points up to 5 days postoperatively and during febrile episodes (>38.0°C). Findings were compared among febrile patients with proven bacterial infection (FWI group; sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, deep wound infection), febrile patients without bacterial infection (FNI group), and patients without fever (NF group). In all, 121 children were enrolled in the study, 31 in the FWI group, 42 in the FNI group, and 48 patients in the NF group. Ages ranged from 4 days to 17.8 years (median 19.0, mean 46 ± 56 months). There was no significant difference among the groups in mean CRP level before surgery, 1 hour, and 18 hours after. A highly significant interaction was found in the change in CRP over time by FWI group compared with FNI group (P < .001). Mean CRP velocity ([fCRP - 18hCRP]/[fever time (days) - 0.75 day]) was significantly higher in the infectious group (4.0 ± 4.2 mg/dL per d) than in the fever-only group (0.60 ± 1.6 mg/dL per d; P < .001). A CRP velocity of 4 mg/dL per d had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 85.7% for bacterial infection with 95.2% specificity. Serial measurements of CRP/CRP velocity after cardiac surgery in children may assist clinicians in differentiating postoperative fever due to bacterial infection from fever due to noninfectious origin."
CD009185,0,14669099,0,Ultrasonography in the evaluation of renal scarring using DMSA scan as the gold standard.,"Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan is presently the technique of choice for assessing renal scars. Recent advances suggest that ultrasonography could replace DMSA scan for this purpose. This paper describes the experience of a tertiary pediatric referral hospital performing ultrasonography and DMSA scans in the assessment of renal scarring. Investigations were conducted 3-6 months after patients presented with urinary tract infection (UTI). Results were extracted from the radiology information system and recorded for analysis. All children with a UTI who had undergone DMSA and ultrasound examination on the same day between January 1995 and December 1999 were included; 930 kidneys were compared. DMSA scan was utilized as the reference method. When used to detect focal renal scarring, ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 5.2%, specificity of 98.3%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 75.8%. When used to detect diffuse renal scarring, ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 47.2%, specificity of 91.8%, PPV of 60.8% and NPV of 86.6%. Our results demonstrate that although ultrasonography has a good specificity for the detection of renal scarring compared with DMSA, it has low sensitivity, PPV and NPV. Ultrasonography cannot be substituted for DMSA scan in the evaluation of focal renal scarring."

CD009185,0,9090657,0,Urinary tract infections in girls: the cost-effectiveness of currently recommended investigative routines.,"Current recommendations for the universal investigation of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children by ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan (and sometimes intravenous pyelography as well) are not based on any convincing evidence as to the necessity or effectiveness of such a routine. Over 8% of all girls will have a UTI during childhood. About 87 individuals in a million will develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by the age of 60 years, caused in about 9% by pyelonephritis (PN) or reflux nephropathy. From these statistics, the maximal risk of a first diagnosed UTI progressing to ESRD is approximately 1:10,000. The risk of developing hypertension following a first UTI in childhood, without eventual evolution to ESRD, appears to be very small. The cost of the widely recommended routine imaging procedures ranges from U.S. $355 in Britain to U.S. $1,090 in the United States. The minimal cost of preventing a single progression to ESRD by early diagnosis of underlying pathology-if this were possible in all cases-would range between U.S. $5 million in Britain and U.S. $15 million in the United States. Since in many instances progressive renal damage can not be prevented, the true cost is considerably higher. Lower UTI in girls is a very common and, in most cases, benign finding in primary-care practice. It is suggested that girls with afebrile UTI, presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms alone, need not undergo any imaging procedures, but should be followed with urine examinations and cultures at the time of febrile illness. The recommended investigative routines should be reserved for UTI in infants and in girls with fever or other symptoms suggesting PN, and for proven recurrent UTI. Such a regimen will allow a marked saving in terms of costs and in terms of unnecessary radiation, psychological stress to children, and stress, inconvenience, and time loss to parents. There is no evidence that this approach will compromise the course or final outcome of this very common condition."

One hundred and seventeen of these cases were found among about 40,000 consecutive routine serum IEP examinations in two laboratories during 1967-1980. Five further cases were detected during the collection of the control series. Only a few TA cases of corresponding type have been reported from elsewhere. Previous studies of some of the patients of the present series had shown that the TA phenomenon was due to complexes between albumin and IgG class autoantibodies against albumin. Clinical data were collected mainly from the hospital records. The chest radiographic findings were classified by the ILO (International Labour Office) method. The author herself examined 33 of the patients during the current disease or during the follow-up. One hundred and ten patients were followed up for a period of three months to nine years (mean 2.5 years). The patients were mostly elderly, and 93% of them were women. Most of the patients had one or more previously diagnosed chronic illnesses, for which they were receiving one or several drugs as long-term therapy. Eighty percent of the patients were receiving nitrofurantoin (NF) as prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infections. However, urinary tract infection was not a current problem in any of the cases. There was evidence of a role of NF in the development of both the immunologic abnormalities and the clinical disease in the TA patients. On the basis of long-term NF treatment the patients were divided into two groups: 1) 97 patients with NF therapy (NF+ group) and 2) 25 patients without NF therapy (NF- group). The patients had mostly undergone the examinations because of cough, dyspnoea, and general symptoms (fatigue, weakness, malaise, loss of weight). The symptoms had usually started insidiously, and in 50% of the patients they had lasted for at least three months. Eight of the patients had been hospitalized because of various acute diseases (e.g. cerebral stroke). Ten of the patients were subjectively symptomless.

CD009185,0,17668243,0,Imaging in childhood urinary tract infections: time to reduce investigations.,"The correct protocol for investigating urinary tract infections (UTI) is unknown but remains a hotly debated topic. The main objective in investigating children with UTI is to prevent the long-term complications of developing hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or pregnancy complications. However, the prognosis for childhood UTI remains good, with low long-term risks, from epidemiological studies, of developing these sequelae. Although childhood UTI is common, the occurrence of CKD and the likelihood that acute pyelonephritis will cause renal damage progressing to CKD are rare. We studied the current literature on investigations of childhood UTI and propose a protocol for carrying out selected investigations in high-risk children. By identifying this group of children with increased risk of having an abnormal urinary tract that warrant investigation, we recommend that targeting investigations to specific children (as opposed to protocol-based investigations of all children with UTI), will be clinically safe and effective and will avoid the unnecessary distress and cost of invasive investigations."

Of 120 proven infections, 31 episodes (25.8%) occurred in patients taking no corticosteroids (CS). The risk of infection was lower in patients taking low-dose CS (< 300 mg prednisolone/month) than no CS (odds ratio (OR) 0.36). In patients receiving high-dose CS (> 1000 mg prednisolone/month), however, the risk increased (OR 2.9). In patients taking no CS, disease activity manifested as increased SLEDAI, anemia and active urinary sediment, was associated with infection. The CRP was higher in the patients with infection than controls and the CRP levels over 50 mg/l were observed only in infection. These results suggest that CS have a bimodal influence on infection depending on dose. Disease activity is an important risk factor for infection in patients taking no CS. Finally, CRP levels greater than 50 mg/l suggest the presence of infection."
CD009185,0,9275111,0,"Renal graft rejection or urinary tract infection? The value of myeloperoxidase, C-reactive protein, and alpha2-macroglobulin in the urine.","Previous investigations have shown that the determination of two acute-phase proteins in the urine, C-reactive protein (CRPu) and alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2-MGu), allows a noninvasive diagnosis of acute renal graft dysfunction. A reliable differentiation between rejection and urinary tract infection can be made only when considering the C-reactive protein in serum and urine at the same time (CRPs:CRPu ratio). Therefore, a diagnostic procedure independent of parameters other than urinary proteins is needed. As granulocytes play only a minor role in graft rejection but are a common feature in urinary tract infection, we determined a marker of granulocytes (myeloperoxidase) in urine (MPOu). Eighty-nine renal transplant recipients were included in the study. In normal courses, CRPu, alpha2-MGu, and MPOu were within the normal range. In 15 cases of acute interstitial rejection, an increased excretion of CRPu and alpha2-MGu could be confirmed, but MPOu could not be detected. On the occasion of acute vascular rejection (n=6), with the exception of one case, MPOu could not be observed. The pattern of the three urinary proteins differed in urinary tract infections (n=40): MPOu could be detected in all cases, CRPu in 50% of cases, and alpha2-MGu in 73% of cases. In patients with cytomegalovirus infection (n=7), no MPOu, CRPu, or alpha2-MGu was found. In conclusion, the simultaneous measurement of the three proteins allows a complete, noninvasive, differential diagnostic procedure of renal graft dysfunction."

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was detected equally well by both methods. Twenty-seven refluxing ureters were found by RNC, 23 by VCU and 22 by both methods. Radiologic grade of reflux may be determined approximately with the isotope technique from the volume of regurgitating urine and duration of reflux, at a much decreased radiation exposure. Residual urine was also measured by RNC and found to be higher in children with VUR. RNC is a reliable method for detecting and grading VUR and should effectively replace VCU as the follow-up examination of choice."
CD009185,0,21089406,0,[Imaging of urinary tract infection in children].,"Urinary tract infection is very common in children. Its diagnosis, management and treatment have led to abundant literature and many controversies. The main challenges are to identify patients at risk of infection and those at risk of complicated infections. Long-term complications include reflux nephropathy, renal hypertension and stage renal disease. Imaging has a triple role: to confirm the diagnosis in patients with equivocal clinical symptoms; to determine patients at risk of recurrence; prevention of infection by detecting already in utero patients with congenital malformation. During the acute phase, Ultrasound has an important role in detecting favouring conditions such as urinary tract dilatation. The use of color Doppler increases the sensibility and specificity of ultrasound. To date, DMSA scan is the key examination for demonstrating the parenchymal lesions. CT-scan and MRI are rarely used in this acute phase. Retrograde voiding cystography (RVC) will be used whenever vesico-ureteric reflux is suspected. A decision algorithm can be proposed bases on US and DMSA; RVC will be performed whenever one of them is positive. CT or MRI will be used to look for abscesses complicating the UTI. DMSA scan is the gold standard for detecting renal scanning, sequellae of the infection. In the future, the role of MRI will surely increase for the demonstration of uropathy acute and sequelae of the renal involvement."

CD009185,0,18368911,0,[Vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring].,"Reflux nephropathy is an acquired focal renal scarring due to the combination of vesicoureteral (VUR) and intrarenal reflux (IRR) associated with urinary tract infections (IUT) and/or permanently high intravesical pressure. Up to 30-60% of children with VUR and a history of symptomatic IUT have renal scarring at the time of their initial studies. The onset of renal scarring usually occurs early in life, usually before age five years and most frequently before three years of age. Girls are at greater risk for developing reflux nephropathy, because of increased incidence of IUT. Reflux nephropathy is different from a diffuse congenital renal scarring (hypo-dysplasia), which is usually discovered antenatally or during infancy in boys with severe VUR. Without serial follow-up (ultrasonography, intravenous pyelourography, 99mTc-DMSA scan) from birth, it is not always possible to differentiate congenital renal scarring from reflux nephropathy. In contrast to reflux nephropathy, congenital renal scarring cannot be prevented. 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is the gold standard technique (sensitivity 92%, specificity 98%) for the diagnosis of reflux nephropathy, but ultrasound is a good modality to monitor kidney growth over time. Reflux nephropathy and hypodysplasia are the main causes of chronic renal failure and arterial hypertension in children and adolescents in our country. The long-term follow-up of children with reflux nephropathy is mandatory, since its complications may take 10 to 20 years to develop. Uncontrollable arterial hypertension and proteinuria are the predictors of poor prognosis. The selective use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers is the efficient antihypertensive therapy, which also modify intrarenal haemodynamics and can preserve renal function."

There was a significant increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and reduction of the renal concentrating capacity in patients with acute pyelonephritis, although the overlap with the cystitis group was greater than for CRP. The transient decrease in urine osmolality was unrelated to age, as were CRP, ESR and the total white blood cell count.

Mixed bacterial suspension containing 1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU) of S. aureus and 3.0 x 10(6) CFU of E. coli was inoculated in the caudal vein at a dose of 0.5 ml/kg. Control animals received the same amount of saline solution. Pyelonephritis was confirmed by lab urine tests and histopathological study of the kidneys. Infected animals initially developed sepsis with a significant increase of leukocytes and C-reactive protein in the blood. Originally only bacteriuria was found in the urine of experimental animals, but later, in the course of the development of pyelonephritis (12-18 days), leucocyturia and active leukocytes (glitter cells) were also available in urine. The levels of beta-2 microglobulin in the urine of infected animals (4.02 +/- 0.04 mmol/l on day 16 and 4.18 + 0.07 mmol/l on day 18) were significantly highly increased (p <0.0001) in comparison with the value of the control group (0.088 +/- 0.005 mmol/l). In the early days the histopathological examination of the kidneys established erythrocyte stasis. Later leukocyte infiltrates were observed in the interstitial tissue around the kidney tubules, glomeruli and vascular walls, and inflammatory cell infiltration and degenerative changes were present in the epithelium of the canaliculi. Combined hematogenous infection with S. aureus and E. coli led to the development of pyelonephritis in rats. The pathology in the kidney tubules was confirmed by histopathological study and by the elevated levels of beta-2 microglobulin and the presence of active leukocytes in urine."

A total of 77 consecutive patients were treated: 40 had UPJO and 37 ureteral strictures. The etiology of the obstruction included congenital UPJO, previous stones, sequelae of endoscopic and open surgery, radiotherapy, and urinary tract reconstruction. A retrograde ureteroscopic approach was used. Evaluation included clinical and radiographic examinations and renal scintigraphy with diuretic wash-out. The procedure was repeated in 21 cases. The median follow-up was 29 months. The procedure was considered successful if it left the patient asymptomatic and with improved renographic function and drainage. The overall success rate was 70%. The best results were obtained in strictures secondary to stones, with a success rate of 94%, and in strictures secondary to reconstructive and ureteroscopic surgery, with a success rate of 91%. In congenital UPJO, the results were less encouraging: in patients with a symptom debut after the age of 18 years, balloon dilation was successful in 57% of cases; in patients with symptom debut before the age of 18 years, success was achieved in only 25% of cases. There were no major complications. It was concluded that simple high-pressure balloon dilation is a safe and reasonably effective technique for the management of most ureteral strictures and congenital UPJO with symptom debut in adult life.

The syndrome was characterized by elevated ESR, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia, the presence of IgG antinuclear antibodies and a positive latex-fixation test. Two patients had severe arthralgia and one of them peripheral lymphadenopathy. Pleural effusion and a chronic active hepatitis were present in the third patient, in whom interstitial cystitis also developed. All signs and symptoms of the lupus-like syndrome disappeared, without corticosteroid or other medication, when nitrofurantoin was omitted. The diminution of pulmonary infiltrates and the reversal of interstitial cystitis also appeared to be directly related to cessation of nitrofurantoin therapy. Our findings indicate that long-term medication with nitrofurantoin may cause, in addition to pulmonary changes, a simultaneous lupus-like syndrome our data also raise the possibility that interstitial cystitis may occur as an adverse reaction to nitrofurantoin therapy."
CD009185,0,9271034,0,Clinical applications of C-reactive protein in pediatrics.,"The body of literature concerning studies of the applications of CRP measurement in the pediatric population continues to grow. Based on current data serial CRP measurements appear to be most useful for monitoring patient response to therapy after the primary diagnosis of invasive infectious or inflammatory diseases, for monitoring patients after major surgical procedures and those with serious burns. Monitoring CRP over time may be used to assess for recrudescent disease, a secondary process or ineffective therapy. In addition CRP appears to be suited to most applications for which the ESR is used but offers many advantages. At present there are no objective outcome-based clinical trial data to justify using CRP values alone, whether elevated or normal, as a basis for management decisions regarding instituting or withholding antimicrobial therapy, or its early discontinuance for patients suspected of having neonatal sepsis, meningitis, bacteremia or pneumonia, regardless of immune status. In addition, because of significant inconsistencies among studies for which CRP has been applied to differential diagnosis of bacterial vs. viral diseases, including meningitis, acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infection, we cannot recommend it for this purpose. Data do not support a role for CRP in differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis or for localizing urinary tract infections."

However, it is not known whether DMSA scintigraphy performed during acute UTI has any prognostic value for outcome assessment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of DMSA scintigraphy performed during UTI as a predictor of patient outcome, to identify children at risk of events [vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) or recurrent UTI] that may lead to the development of progressive renal damage. One hundred and fifty-two children (including 78 girls) with a mean age of 20 months (range 1 month to 12 years) with first febrile UTI were evaluated by DMSA scintigraphy during acute UTI. After acute UTI, children were explored by voiding cysto-urethrography. Children who presented an abnormal DMSA study, or a normal DMSA study but VUR or recurrent UTI, underwent a DMSA control study 6 months after UTI. Children with VUR were followed up by direct radionuclide cystography. DMSA scintigraphy performed during acute UTI was normal in 112 children (74%). In 95 of these children, follow-up DMSA scintigraphy was not performed owing to a good clinical outcome. In the remaining 17 children, follow-up scintigraphy was normal. Forty children (26%) presented abnormal DMSA study during acute UTI. Twenty-five of them presented a normal follow-up DMSA, and 15 presented cortical lesions. Children with abnormal DMSA had a higher frequency of VUR than children with normal DMSA (48% vs 12%). It is concluded that children with normal DMSA during acute UTI have a low risk of renal damage. Children with normal follow-up DMSA and low-grade VUR have more frequent spontaneous resolution of VUR."
CD009185,0,15653436,0,Pathophysiology and diagnostic value of urinary trypsin inhibitors.,"Inflammation is an important indicator of tissue injury. In the acute form, there is usually accumulation of fluids and plasma components in the affected tissues. Platelet activation and the appearance in blood of abnormally increased numbers of polymorphonucleocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages usually occur. Infectious disorders such as sepsis, meningitis, respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, viral infection, and bacterial infection usually induce an inflammatory response. Chronic inflammation is often associated with diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, kidney diseases, and certain auto-immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, organ failures and other disorders with an inflammatory component or etiology. The disorder may occur before inflammation is apparent. Markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and urinary trypsin inhibitors have changed our appraisal of acute events such as myocardial infarction; the infarct may be a response to acute infection and (or) inflammation. We describe here the pathophysiology of an anti-inflammatory agent termed urinary trypsin inhibitor (uTi). It is an important anti-inflammatory substance that is present in urine, blood and all organs. We also describe the anti-inflammatory agent bikunin, a selective inhibitor of serine proteases. The latter are important in modulating inflammatory events and even shutting them down."

During the follow-up period of 3-7 years, two children (5%) had UTI; 66% of VUR grade 1 and 2 disappeared. The progression of scars was only detected in two of nine children with renal scars on the initial study, both of whom had high-grade VUR. Renal ultrasound was normal in all siblings and none developed hypertension. The results indicate that low-grade sterile VUR may not play a major role in renal scarring, but this may not be the case with high-grade sterile VUR. Considering the correlations among VUR, UTI and reflux nephropathy, routine screening for VUR at an early age in asymptomatic siblings of children with VUR seems to be justified to identify those at the greatest risk of subsequent renal damage."

Tc 99m-DMSA scanning detected renal scarring in 29 women (46%). Multivariate analysis showed that pregnancy and hypoalbuminemia (albumin level, <3.2 g/dL) at hospitalization were independent risk factors for subsequent development of renal scars. At follow-up, hypertension was observed in approximately one-fifth of patients, regardless of renal scarring status. Four women with scars had a glomerular filtration rate of < or =75 mL/min; none of them developed severe renal impairment. In conclusion, the risk of developing renal scarring after AP in adult women is high. However, clinically relevant renal damage is rare 10-20 years after AP. Tc 99m-DMSA scanning is useful for detecting renal scars in adults but is not routinely needed in practice."

Urethral syndrome was found in 15 out of 32 patients with AS: 11 of them had urethritis and 4 urethritis associated with vaginitis. Five women of the control group suffered from urethritis. In all cases with genitourinary infection, Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated. By comparing the AS-patients (urogenital infection group and the non-infected group) with regard to other present clinical parameters, it was found, as expected, that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the 1st hour was significantly higher in the infected group. In addition, the infected patients had a significantly higher incidence of enthesopathy, involvement of the spinal column, and higher C-reactive protein values (CRP > or = 5 mg/l). A family history of AS was equally present. Other clinical parameters, such as inflammatory involvement of the joints and HLA-B27 correlation, did not differ significantly between infected and non-infected patients."

CD009185,0,17368268,0,"Combined laparoscopic and vaginal approach for nephrectomy, ureterectomy, and removal of a large rectovaginal endometriotic nodule causing loss of renal function.","A late consequence of ureteral endometriosis is the silent loss of renal function caused by progressive ""enclosure"" of the lower part of the ureter by the endometriosis. In our experience, in cases of severe loss of renal function with cortical atrophy and residual kidney function (evaluated by Tc99 DMSA scintigraphy) of less than 15%, removal of the endometriosis combined with ureterolysis does not allow recovery of renal function. A nonfunctioning kidney associated with hydronephrosis is a risk factor for vascular hypertension, recurrent pyelonephritis, or kidney stones and therefore an indication for nephrectomy. By means of a case report, this paper describes the combination of laparoscopic nephrectomy, ureterectomy, removal of the rectovaginal endometriotic nodule, and extraction of the kidney through the vagina."

A 81-year-old male who had been followed for cerebral thrombosis, diabetes mellitus and basal cell carcinoma was admitted to our hospital because of high fever. Leukocytosis, a positive CRP test and pyuria were seen. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli were detected by urine and blood culture, respectively. He was treated with antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection and sepsis. After starting treatment, a low grade fever continued. On the twenty first hospital day he developed pyrexia again, and a large abscess was demonstrated in the right psoas muscle by pelvic couputed tomography. The abscess was drained and a specimen from it yielded E. coli on culture. Treatment with antibiotics and drainage resulted in symptomatic improvement. In Japan, 82 cases of psoas abscess have been reported from 1990 to 1994. Four cases of these reports were above eighty years old. The experience with this case indicates the necessity of adequate care in cases of elderly diabetes complicated by psoas abscess."
CD009185,0,1640534,0,The sensitivity of renal scintigraphy and sonography in detecting nonobstructive acute pyelonephritis.,"Recently it has been demonstrated that any child with proved acute pyelonephritis may be at risk for parenchymal scarring, whether or not reflux is present. Since cortical renal scintigraphy has been shown to detect accurately renal inflammation, we compared cortical scintigraphy with renal sonography in 46 children with documented acute pyelonephritis to determine which modality is best to detect patients at risk for renal injury. Cortical scintigraphy was abnormal in 36 children (78%) and renal ultrasonography was abnormal in 5 (11%). Reflux was demonstrated in only 20 cases (43%). We conclude that cortical scintigraphy is the preferred imaging technique for diagnosing renal inflammation, and it should be used routinely in every child with suspected acute pyelonephritis. A new imaging protocol is proposed."
CD009185,0,10637719,1,Urinary tract infection in children.,"Two hundred and eighty-five children under 15 years old (169 boys and 116 girls) who had urinary tract infection (UTI) were admitted to our hospital during the period July 1995 to June 1998. Clinical presentation, laboratory data and image studies were recognized and analyzed. Most patients were younger than 2 years of age. Fever is the most common sign, especially in young children. With the urinary dipstick test a low positive rate of nitrite reaction (34.7%) was found. E. coli is the most common pathogen and exclusively resistant to ampicillin (90.2%). The E. coli is also relatively resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (57.1%). Voiding cystourethrogram was performed in 187 cases, in which 24.6% of those patients showed vesicoureteric reflux. Ninety-eight children received 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans and 62 cases (63.3%) had abnormal findings compatible with pyelonephritis. The positive predictive values by renal ultrasonography for vesicoureteric reflux and pyelonephritis are 30.7% and 78.9%, respectively. In pyelonephritis patients, only 37% also had a vesicoureteric reflux. The fever duration and clinical inflammatory parameters were evaluated in all patients. Longer febrile periods are the risk of vesicoureteric reflux and pyelonephritis, and a high C-reactive protein concentration indicates the risk of pyelonephritis. In conclusion, fever was the most common sign in young UTI children who had a low positive nitrite reaction rate in the dipstick test. E. coli was the most common pathogen with a high ampicillin resistance in Taiwan. Only 37% pyelonephritis patients had refluxing nephropathy. It is indicated that pyelonephritis is not always attributed to reflux of infected urine. A longer febrile period and a high C-reactive protein level are good indicators for prediction of the risk of pyelonephritis in UTI patients."
CD009185,0,4042509,0,Photopenia of a hemithorax on technetium-99m HMDP bone scintigraphy resulting from massive pleural effusion.,"Accumulation of Tc-99m labeled phosphonate bone scanning agent in a pleural effusion usually shows a mild and diffuse increase in radioactivity of the involved thorax. A malignant neoplasm was thought to account for this accumulation. The photon deficiency of the hemithorax on Tc-99m HMDP bone scintigraphy was shown in a case of massive pleural effusion, which was proved by autopsy to be due to metastatic breast carcinoma in the pleura. Two factors caused these scintigraphic findings: 1) a large amount of fluid in the pleural cavity caused photon attenuation; 2) the higher body background in the noninvolved hemithorax and other areas of the body was due to renal dysfunction resulting from chronic pyelonephritis. Whether the accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical agent in the pleural effusion was malignant or benign could not readily be distinguished."

Daily calorie and protein administration were based on the patient's severity (Stress factor with the range of 35-50 kcal/kg/day and 1.5-2.5 g/kg/day, respectively) Starting with half concentration liquid immune formula through nasogastric tube by continuous drip at 30 ml/h and increasing to maximum level within 4 days. The additional energy and protein requirement will be given either by parenteral or oral nutritional support. Various nutritional, metabolic, immunologic and clinical parameters were observed on day 0 (baseline), day 3, 7, and 14. Analysis was performed by paired student-t test. Initial mean serum albumin and transferrin showed mild (trauma) to moderate (burn and cancer) degree of malnutrition. Significant improvement of nutritional parameters was seen at day 7 and 14 in trauma and burn patients. Significant increase of total lymphocyte count (day 7, P < 0.01), CD4 + count (day 7, p < 0.01), CD8 + count (day 7, p < 0.0005 & day 14, p < 0.05), complement C3 (day 7, p < 0.005 day 14, p < 0.01), IgG (day 7, and 14, p < 0.0005), IgA (day 7, p < 0.0005 & day 14, p < 0.05), in all patients. C-reactive protein decreased significantly on day 7 (p < 0.0005) and day 14 (p < 0.005). 3 cases of burn wound infection, one case of UTI and one case of sepsis were observed. Two cases of hyperglycemia in burn, 3 cases of hyperbilirubinemia in trauma, 10 cases of elevated LFT (5 trauma/5 burn), and one case of hyponatremia in cancer patients were observed. Two cases of nausea, 4 cases of vomiting, 5 cases of diarrhea (< 3 times/day), 2 cases of abdominal cramp, 1 case of distension were observed. The feeding of IMMUNE FORMULA was well tolerated and significant improvement was observed in nutritional and immunologic parameters as in other immunoenhancing diets. Further clinical trials of prospective double-blind randomized design are necessary to address the so that the necessity of using immunonutrition in critically ill patients will be clarified."

The study comprised children aged 1-18 years, average 8.8 +/- 0.4 (77.8% girls). Recurrent UTI was observed in 76.8% of children. Acute UTI was diagnosed in 20.8% of children. In 2.4% of children UTI was detected during hospitalization because of other diseases. In all children urinary X-ray examination was performed. Anatomical abnormalities were detected in 38% of children. Vesico-ureteral reflux was diagnosed in 61 children (29.5%). In 16/25 (64%) of children with vesico-ureteral reflux renal scarring was detected by radionuclide examination. In some children urodynamic examination was performed and in all of them functional abnormalities were detected."

It appears that the accuracy of the MAG3 image is population dependent: when, in most of the patients of a study group, DMSA scintigraphy is either normal or very abnormal, the MAG3 image will correctly reflect the DMSA scintigraph. However, when the DMSA alterations are less pronounced, the early MAG3 image will miss the lesions in about 50% of the cases."
CD009185,0,19794981,0,Risk factors for serious bacterial infection in febrile young infants in a community referral hospital.,"Differentiation of serious bacterial infection (SBI) from self-limiting viral illness in febrile infants younger than three months is a significant challenge for clinicians. We aimed to assess the risk factors for SBI in febrile infants. Data were obtained from 221 infants younger than three months who visited a single community referral hospital for fever and underwent a complete sepsis workup between August 2003 and July 2006. The causes of fever were febrile illness without a documented cause (FISDC, 65%), urinary tract infection (UTI, 12%), aseptic meningitis (12%), bacteremia (4%), bacterial meningitis (2%). Cerebrospinal fluid enterovirus polymerase chain reaction was positive in 28% of FISDC and 48% of aseptic meningitis cases. When UTI was excluded, the risk factors for SBI were 1) C-reactive protein (CRP) level of > or =1.87 mg/dL and 2) fevers of > or =38.9 degrees C. The specificity and negative predictive values of risk factors 1) and 2) for the diagnosis of SBI were 94% and 95%, respectively. We concluded that enteroviral infection may be a major cause of febrile episodes in infants younger than three months. If UTI could be excluded, the presence of CRP levels > or =1.87 mg/dL and fevers of > or =38.9 degrees C can be used as criteria to rule out SBI in these infants."

CD009185,0,11808890,0,Predicting serious bacterial infection in young children with fever without apparent source.,"The aim of this study was to design a clinical rule to predict the presence of a serious bacterial infection in children with fever without apparent source. Information was collected from the records of children aged 1-36 mo who attended the paediatric emergency department because of fever without source (temperature > or = 38 degrees C and no apparent source found after evaluation by a general practitioner or history by a paediatrician). Serious bacterial infection included bacterial meningitis, sepsis, bacteraemia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, bacterial gastroenteritis, osteomyelitis and ethmoiditis. Using multivariate logistic regression and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC area), the diagnostic value of predictors for serious bacterial infection was judged, resulting in a risk stratification. Twenty-five percent of the 231 patients enrolled in the study (mean age 1.1 y) had a serious bacterial infection. Independent predictors from history and examination included duration of fever, poor micturition, vomiting, age, temperature < 36.7 degrees C or > or = 40 degrees C at examination, chest-wall retractions and poor peripheral circulation (ROC area: 0.75). Independent predictors from laboratory tests were white blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein and the presence of >70 white blood cells in urinalysis (ROC area: 0.83). The risk stratification for serious bacterial infection ranged from 6% to 92%."
CD009185,0,17221248,0,"[Pelvic kidney in childhood. Specific features, concomitant pathologies and useful diagnostic investigations].","In a retrospective analysis we studied the case histories of 31 children who had been seen in our department for investigation of pelvic ectopic kidney between January 1994 and June 2005. The evaluation of each involved the medical history, ultrasound examination, VCUG, and DMSA scan or MAG3 diuresis renogram. Of the 31 children, 21 (67.7%) had initially been referred to our department for further investigation and clarification because renal agenesis was suspected. In the remaining 10 (32.3%) children the pelvic kidney was an incidental finding observed during investigation of various other conditions. Overall, 7 (22.6%) of the 31 were symptomatic (recurrent urinary tract infections, abdominal pain, hypertension, hydronephrosis), while 77.4% (24/31) were completely free of symptoms at the time of follow-up. Ultrasound revealed that the ectopic kidney was on the left in 64.5% (20/31) of these cases. Nuclear scans performed both at the time of the initial diagnosis and at follow-up were available for 11 of the 31 children and showed a mild improvement of the partial function of the pelvic kidney, from a mean of 25.6% to a mean of 34.6%. In conclusion, whenever renal agenesis is suspected on ultrasonographic examination, the investigator should first consider renal ectopia; ultrasound examination with the bladder full is the definitive diagnostic procedure. For asymptomatic cases we recommend regular ultrasound monitoring of the kidney -- at first every 6 months and later once a year. In cases with complex anatomy MRI is a suitable method for further diagnostic work-up."

Forty-two of them presented ureterosigmoidostomy and 15 orthotopic ileal bladder. The CT appearance of the normal post-cystectomy pelvis is emphasized. Both early and late surgical and neoplastic complications were detected. Early surgical complications, including urinary fistulae, urinomas, seromas, lymphoceles, and abscesses, were diagnosed over a 6-month postoperative period. Late surgical complications included hydroureteronephrosis, calculosis, and pyelonephritis. Hydroureteronephrosis, due to stenosis of the ureteral anastomosis, was the most frequent complication. All such neoplastic complications as local recurrence, lymphnode distant metastases, were identified. In 83% of cases they were observed over a 2-year postoperative period. Distant metastases in the upper abdomen were never detected. The authors' experience suggests the following as the optimal follow-up: a) CT examination over a 6-month postoperative period; b) yearly CT examinations and urography over 4 postoperative years; c) yearly US examination over the first 2 years after surgery, to depict renal pelvis dilatation. Skeletal scintigraphy is often necessary to detect metastatic bone lesions. It should be performed no later than 2 years after cystectomy."

The purpose of this retrospective study is to report data recorded over a five-month period (February - June 2006) in the pediatric-neonatal department of the Hospital Center in Mayotte. The study cohort includes a total of 50 children in whom chikungunya was confirmed by molecular tools. Mean age was 9.3 years and the male-to-female sex ratio was 1:5. The main symptoms were intense pain (88%), high fever (82%), and skin rash (80%) that was less common in children under 2 years of age. Neurological complications were observed in 46% of patients including hypotonia (22%) that occurred mainly in newborns, meningitis syndrome (18%) and convulsions (16%) that occurred mainly in children over 2 years of age. Infectious complications included pneumonia (4%), pyelonephritis (2%), and possible nosocomial septicemia due to Pseudomonas (6%). The main hematological abnormalities were lymphopenia (27%) and thrombopenia (16%). Serum CRP values were moderately high (mean, 25 mg/l). Elevated AST (24%) and ALT (10%) values were observed. High CSF protein levels were noted in 30% of cases. A total of 25 children required hospitalization for more than 10 days. There were two deaths in newborns infected before the seventh day of life.

All the patients were assessed for VUR grade by voiding cystoureterography and for presence of renal scarring by (99 m) technetium dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy. All infants with VUR were given low-dose prophylactic antibiotics and followed-up until resolution of the reflux. Grade of reflux and number of urinary tract infection (UTI) episodes (≥3) were found to be statistically significant risk factors for renal scarring (P <0.05). However, gender, familial history and laterality of the disease were not found to be statistically significant risk factors (P >0.05). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference of frequency of renal scarring among the different age groups (P >0.05). We conclude that recurrences of UTI and VUR severity are significant risk factors for renal scarring in children with VUR. Therefore, identification of VUR at an early age may offer the opportunity to prevent episodes of UTI and possible formation of renal scars that may result in end-stage renal failure."

From the dynamic study, six functional images of the mean time were generated. Each functional image was analyzed separately to search for focal areas of increased mean time within the kidney contour, especially over the kidney parenchyma. Time-activity curves from these areas were generated and analyzed. Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy showed generalized or focal decreased uptake in 32 (41.8%) kidneys, and deconvolution analysis of Tc-99m DTPA scintigraphy revealed pathologic renographic curves in 58 (77.6%) kidneys. Prolonged whole-kidney and normal renal parenchymal transit times (dilatation without obstruction) were found in 38 (50%) kidneys, whereas prolonged whole-kidney and renal parenchymal transit times (dilatation with obstruction) were observed in 20 (27.6%) kidneys. Separate analysis of each of the six functional images of the mean time showed focal areas of increased mean time in the kidney parenchyma of 11 kidneys. In five cases, time-activity curves from these areas showed a sharp increase of activity on the descending part of the curve, which might reflect the return of urine from the collecting system into kidney cortex (i.e., intrarenal reflux). These results showed that in a urinary tract with acute pyelonephritis, urodynamic changes may lead to obstructive nephropathy and intrarenal reflux. Tc-99m DTPA renal scintigraphy in the zoom mode using deconvolution analysis with six functional images of the mean time has proved to be a valuable method to evaluate acute pyelonephritis, thus allowing dynamic and morphologic analysis of the urinary tract at the same time."

She had a fever of 38.2 degrees C. C-reactive protein was raised to 80 mg/l, the white cell count to 14,620/microliters (83% neutrophils). Protein and white cells were found in the urine together with a significant number of E. coli on urine culture. Plain film of the abdomen showed a staghorn calculus and ultrasonography demonstrated renal enlargement with a possible paranephritic abscess. The computed tomography diagnosis was xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, on the basis of renal enlargement, staghorn calculus, hypodense areas with typical density values (10-15 Hounsfield units), contrast enrichment and extrarenal extension of partly phlegmonous partly fused-together inflammatory changes. The abscessing parts were drained under computed tomography control. Starting 7 days pre-operatively the patient had been receiving ciprofloxacin (0.4 g daily) intravenously.

CD009185,0,11442993,0,Pediatric urinary tract infections: current controversies.,"Few topics in pediatric urology engender such vigorous debate as the who, when, how, and why related to the investigation of pediatric urinary tract infections (UTIs). Further controversy stems from management of the underlying pathology. This article first discusses the patient characteristics that are important in the evaluation of pediatric patients with UTIs, and the indications for screening tests (such as voiding cystourethrograms, ultrasound, dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy, and intravenous pyelography). Following this, the author reviews what is known about three controversial aspects about the management of these patients. First, although the role of the prepuce in pediatric UTI is well established, the role of routine circumcision is not. Second, the natural history and etiology of antenatally detected vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has provoked us to view the concept of ""primary reflux"" in a new light. Third, although the way to diagnose vesicoureteral reflux is generally agreed upon, the utility of our surgical management in view of long-term follow-up is less clear."
CD009185,0,9814110,0,[Comparative study of anatomical changes and function in kidneys after reconstructive surgery of the urinary tract using scintigraphic and other imaging examinations].,"We performed a comparative evaluation of anatomical and functional changes in kidneys after urinary tract reconstructive procedures and in patients with history of urinary tract infections using renal scintigraphy and other imaging techniques. Statistically significant differences in the prevalence of pathological findings in imaging between these groups were shown. When children after the RVU are taken into account renal scintigraphy supplies us with objective and precise data about the renal scarring degree. In this group repeated renal scintigraphy should be warranted. After the reconstructive procedures due to hydronephrosis the images from ultrasonography and renal scintigraphy correlate well. Ultrasonography is a golden standard for screening these patients. Statistically significant higher degree of renal scarring in renal scintigraphy in patients after urinary tract infections without urinary tract defect proves the important role of infections in the pathogenesis of these changes. Children with recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections should be submitted to renal scintigraphy imaging on regularly basis, as a risk group of higher chronic pyelonephritis prevalence."

CD009185,0,16079971,0,[Modern imaging technology for childhood urinary tract infection].,"Imaging in childhood urinary tract infection (UTI) is still a matter of debate. There are established guidelines, however new knowledge and the changed medical environment have enhanced this ongoing discussion. These new insights have impacted therapy and consequently the imaging algorithm. Modern imaging methods -- particularly MRI and modern ultrasound (US) -- are less invasive with a lower radiation burden. Additionally, it has been shown that VUR is a poor predictor for renal scarring out, which affects long-term results. Furthermore, the majority of UT malformations is depicted by prenatal US. The most crucial aspect of improving long-term outcome appears to be the early and reliable depiction of UTI and effective treatment to prevent renal scarring. This review tries to present this new knowledge and to discuss the potential of modern imaging. Recent changes in imaging algorithms are highlighted and an outcome-oriented algorithm that addresses these recent developments is proposed, without lightly abandoning established standards. It consists of an orienting US and -- for depiction of renal involvement -- amplitude coded color Doppler sonography or renal static scintigraphy (considered the gold standard, particularly for evaluating scars); in future MRI may play a role. Based on this concept, only patients with renal damage as well as patients with complex urinary tract malformations or intractable recurrent UTI may have to undergo VCUG."
CD009185,0,1093351,1,Level diagnosis of symptomatic urinary tract infections in childhood.,"As no method for localization of urinary tract infection has been shown to be absolutely reliable, six procedures have been carried out simultaneously in 25 girls with acute symptomatic infections and the reliability of each method assessed. While clinical diagnosis of pyelonephritis or cystitis correlated well with the overall results of the battery of tests, the reliability of individual tests varied. Highest reliability was obtained with CRP determinations followed by antibody titration, sedimentation rate, and renal concentrating capacity. In the bladder washout test only 8 of the 14 patients with pyelonephritis had findings clearly indicating high infection. Intermittent or inadequate discharge of bacteria from the renal parenchyma is suggested as the major source for this inaccuracy. In fact, half of the 42 final washout specimens from girls with acute pyelonephritis contained less than 1000 bacteria per ml, indicating that low numbers of organisms in ureteric urine is common in childhood pyelonephritis."

CD009185,0,3516651,0,Selected laboratory in pediatric emergency care.,"The superiority of either a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein as a generic, global screening test for bacterial infection in infants or children has not been clearly demonstrated. The few claims of superiority for one determination over another relate more to the clinical setting than marginal differences in sensitivity or specificity. Neither the complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein has proved sensitive enough of predicting invasive bacterial infection that it can be used as an isolated measure upon which major management decisions can safely be based. Several investigators have therefore addressed whether these tests can complement each other. Unfortunately, acquisition of multiple nonspecific laboratory tests in a given clinical situation may yield widely divergent results. The C-reactive protein, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and zeta sedimentation ratio are all comparably priced in the $15.00 to $30.00 range. However, if multiple tests are obtained, the cost of this approach may become unacceptably high. Current practice advocates a careful evaluation of an ill pediatric patient in an Emergency setting. The initial clinical impression of an experienced clinician based on history and physical examination frequently provides dependable information with which to direct subsequent evaluation. If bacterial infection ranks high on the differential list, relevant laboratory studies should be considered. Observation of quantitative and qualitative changes of the hematologic profile or rate of erythrocyte sedimentation are adequate tools in specific circumstances. With the resurgence of interest in the use of C-reactive protein, it too may join the ranks of convention in selected settings."

It is usually diagnosed after scrotal exploration for symptoms which mimic manifestations between EO and torsion of the cord and its appendage. The pathophysiologic mechanisms for the development of EO are not well known. Although some causative agents of EO have been reported, in most cases there was no clear etiology. We report a 3-month-old male infant who had been well until the day prior to admission when irritability, left testicular swelling, scrotal erythema with a hot sensation were noted by his mother. He was treated medically after excluding the possibility of an emergent surgical condition (such as torsion of the cord and its appendage, or incarcerated hernia) by means of physical examinations, abdominal and inguino-scrotal sonography, laboratory studies, and testicular radionuclide scintigraphy. A catheterized sample of urine for culture yielded Escherichia coli. There was the possibility that the EO was caused by hematogenous rather than local spread from an infection of the urinary tract. He was treated with a 10-day course of intravenous cefazolin and amikacin. Following this, he improved clinically and a repeat catheterized urine sample remained sterile on culture. In addition, a bilateral inguinal hernia and hydrocele were detected by inguino-scrotal sonography and were operated on the 11th hospital day.

The DMSA scan was abnormal in 62 children (89%). However, using a high-frequency transducer we found abnormal sonogram changes in 61 children (87%), consisting of an increased kidney volume in 42, and/or a thickening of the wall of the renal pelvis in 42, and/or a focal hyper- or hypoechogenicity in 36, and/or a diffuse hyperechogenicity in 31 children.

Data of patients who were examined by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy between 1995 and 2005 were evaluated retrospectively. Gender, age, reflux grade, presence/development of scarring, breakthrough UTIs, and resolution of reflux, were recorded. The relation of gender, age and VUR grade to preformed scarring and the relation of gender, age, VUR grade, presence of preformed scarring, number of breakthrough UTIs and reflux resolution to new scarring were assessed. There were 138 patients [male/female (M/F) 53/85]. Multivariate analysis showed that male gender [odds ratio (OR) 2.5], age > or = 27 months in girls (OR 4.2) and grades IV-V reflux (OR 12.4) were independent indicators of renal scarring. On the other hand, only the presence of previous renal scarring was found to be an independent indicator for the development of new renal scar (OR 13.4). In conclusion, while the most predictive variables for the presence of renal scarring among children presenting with a UTI were male gender, age > or = 27 months in girls, and grades IV-V reflux, the best predictor of new scar formation was presence of previous renal scarring."

CD009185,0,18924514,0,[Urinary tract infections--pediatric urologist point of view].,"Urinary tract infections (UTI) could present with different clinical forms dependent on intensity and localization of infection and child's age. The symptoms could be non specific in children. Condition that provoke to urinary stasis, especially voiding dysfunction is the favourable factor for UTI appearance. Gram-negative enteric bacteria is the most common pathogen. Urine culture is the basic investigation that allow to identify pathogen and its drug sensitiveness but simultaneous urinalysis is necessary to recognize the inflammation of urinary organs. In addition, the number of leukocytes gives an idea about inflammation intensity. Ultrasonographic (USG) scan is necessary to examine urostasis. DMSA study performed during febrile UTI allow to identify children with acute pyelonephritis and when repeated 6 months later - those with renal scars. A normal USG and DMSA scan during infection makes voiding cystourethrography (VCU) unnecessary in the primary examination. The presence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) not always predispose children to renal lesions. Early and appropriate treatment of UTI, especially during the first 24 hours, diminishes the likelihood of renal involvement during the acute phase of infection but does not prevent scar formation. The proper hygiene of the urethral meatus, voiding and drinking habits and preventing of constipation are crucial in UTI prophylaxis."

The frequency of persistent lesions in kidneys with mild-moderate lesions (less than 50% of kidney involvement) in the presence of VUR or in non-refluxing kidneys was similar (P=0.1447), while the frequency of persistent lesions in kidneys with severe lesions in the presence of VUR was significantly higher than the frequency of persistent lesions in non-refluxing kidneys (P=0.0089). The extent of kidney involvement and the presence of VUR make possible the identification of different categories of risk of scarring: in the ""low risk group"" (normal kidney with/without VUR) the risk of scarring is 0%; in the ""intermediate risk group"" (mild lesions with/without VUR; extensive lesions without VUR) the risk of scarring is between 14% and 38%, while in the ""high risk group"" (extensive lesions with VUR) the risk of scarring is 88%. Quantifying the risk of scarring could help in planning the treatment or in modifying the later strategy."
CD009185,0,8869786,0,DMSA renal scans in adults with acute pyelonephritis.,"The 99mTc-DMSA scan is accepted as the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting areas of renal parenchymal scarring. More recently the DMSA scan has also been shown to be of value in imaging areas of renal parenchymal involvement in both children and adults with acute pyelonephritis. We assessed the acute DMSA scan findings in a consecutive series of 81 patients hospitalized with acute pyelonephritis. Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed if the patient had a fever of > 37.8 degrees C, loin pain or tenderness and infected urine (99% Escherichia coli). Patients had a blood culture taken (8 positive), as well as a hematological (leukocytosis 75%) and biochemical screen, C-reactive protein (CRP) (increased in 57 of 66 [86%]) and urinary tract ultrasonography. If the initial DMSA scan was abnormal it was repeated after three months and in some instances again at six months. If persisting defects were noted an intravenous urogram was then undertaken. Of the 81 patients, 37 (46%) had an abnormality on the DMSA scan. Nineteen had a single defect, 12 multifocal defects, five features suggestive of pre-existing renal parenchymal scarring (all later shown to have reflux nephropathy) and one a shrunken kidney. Those patients with an abnormal scan had a higher CRP concentration than those with a normal scan. Of the 31 patients who had either a focal or multifocal defect on their initial DMSA scan there was adequate follow-up on 24 patients. In 18 of these the defects had resolved by six months (usually within three months), while of the remainder, three were shown to have reflux nephropathy, one had a large single renal cyst and another an area of parenchymal calcification. Fifty-three of 76 patients (70%) had normal ultrasonography. In adults with acute pyelonephritis, the DMSA scan may prove to be the most useful renal imaging procedure."

UTI was present in 121 of 1897 patients (6.4%), 95 of whom (78.5%) were female. Comparison of the parameters between non-infected and infected patients were as follows: body temperature was 36.57 +/- 0.64 degrees C vs. 37.49 +/- 0.77 degree C; WBC, 5410 +/- 2040/microliters vs. 7260 +/- 3230/microliters; CRP, 1.2 +/- 2.4 mg/dl vs. 3.5 +/- 3.4 mg/dl; mean class of urinary RBC, 0-1/hpf vs. 3-5/hpf; and mean class of urinary WBC, 5-10/hpf vs. 30-50/hpf. All parameters were significantly elevated (p < 0.001) in the patients with UTI. The rate of detection of causative bacteria was 88.7%; with 14.8% Escherichia coli, 12.8% Providencia species, 9.6% Enterococci, and 8.7% Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients with UTI were divided into three groups according to their method of urination: normal urination, use of diapers and catheterization. Body temperature (> or = 37.5 degrees C) was 2.8%, 10.1% and 34.9%; WBC (> or = 9.000), 2.7%, 6.1%, and 14.3%; CRP, 16.9%, 36.1% and 51.1%; urine RBC (> or = 6-10/hpf), 8.4%, 7.1% and 36.1%; urine WBC (> or = 15-30/hpf), 20.4%, 44.4% and 76.9%, respectively. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05-0.001) between all parameters except for urine RBC between the normal-urination patients and diaper using patients.

In a prospective study conducted at a PHC clinic, 16 of 94 children (17%) from whom urine was collected by strict aseptic catheterization had bacteriuria (BU). Twelve of these had associated leucocyturia (> 5 WBC/HPF). The median age of those with BU was 9 months (range 1-30 months). BU rarely occurred in isolation (6%), but was most often detected in association with acute respiratory infection (43%) and acute diarrhoea (19%). No association of BU with mild malnutrition was detected in the 50% of children who were underweight for age. Gram-negative pathogens accounted for 14 cases (87.5%). These pathogens were resistant to commonly recommended antibiotics for UTI. Only five cases of BU returned for follow-up at 3 months; no abnormalities were detected on repeat catheter urine samples, urinary tract ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrogram and DMSA studies in them. From these and other findings we conclude that BU is probably often present in young children with common diseases attending PHC centres in developing countries. Further studies are required to establish exactly the role these pathogens play in the pathogenesis of UTI."
CD009185,0,18666470,0,[Procalcitonin and prediction of vesico-ureteral reflux in pediatric urinary tract infection].,"An estimated 7% of girls and 2% of boys will have a urinary tract infection before 6 years of age, and between 20 and 40% of these children are diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux. Reflux is a risk factor for recurrent infections and renal scarring, which can lead to hypertension and kidney failure. Pediatric guidelines recommend routine voiding cystourethrography, but this is a painful and expensive examination that exposes children to radiation. Reliable non invasive markers of reflux would therefore be extremely useful. Ultrasonography and clinical decision rules have poor sensitivity for vesicoureteral reflux. In contrast, the level of procalcitonin, a marker of the severity of bacterial infections, is a good predictor of cystographic findings in children with a first febrile urinary tract infection. Indeed, a procalcitonin level below 0.5 ng/ml predicted the absence of radiological reflux with a sensitivity of more than 75% in the French princeps study. This was validated by a prospective European study, in which sensitivity reached 100% for high-grade reflux. Procalcitonin assay can thus avoid voiding cystourethrography in 40 to 50% of young children with febrile urinary tract infections."

Its activity increases in the urine of patients with a malignancy, inflammation, or infection, or in late pregnancy. The objective of this study was to compare the sensitivity of uTi in urine with that of serum quantitative C-reactive protein (CRP) for diagnosing infection, as indicated by white cell response and clinical assessment. Ninety controls and 171 patients with various systemic infections were enrolled. We measured uTi enzymatically on a Cobas Fara (Roche Diagnostics). Patients were separated into bacterial, probable bacterial, viral, or probable viral groups based on the results of a complete blood count with differential (CBC), urinalysis (UA), and clinical assessment. In the bacterial (n=70) and control (n=90) groups, the uTi values (mean+/-SE) were 25.3+/-3.1 mg/L and 2.8+/-0.8 mg/L, respectively. uTi (at 2.7 mg/L) had a diagnostic sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 82% (AUC=0.889), whereas CRP (at a cutoff of 10 mg/L) had a sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 96%, respectively (AUC=0.921). As a marker of infection (positive in both bacterial and viral groups), uTi had a sensitivity of 91% (AUC=0.884) vs. 89% (AUC=0.828) for CRP. Our data indicate that uTi has sufficient clinical sensitivity for screening systemic infections, and may have diagnostic value as a noninvasive test."

On admission, laboratory findings revealed pyuria, inflammatory changes, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Computed tomography showed left ureteral stone and hydronephrosis. Gallium scintigraphy showed avid uptake in the left kidney. Serum concentration of vancomycin was 57.4 micro/ml. Candida glabrata was isolated from blood, sputum and urine. Under the diagnosis of fungemia and left pyelonephritis, he was treated with micafungin (150 mg/day), gabexate mesilate and insertion of a double-ended pigtail catheter. The above treatment produced regression of systemic inflammation, DIC and acute renal failure. At the last follow-up 3 weeks after discharge, ureteroscopy showed that the ureter stone had already passed but a soft white-yellowish bezoar was detected in the ureter.

Patients and methods Forty-three children underwent surgery to relieve upper urinary tract obstruction; 37 had pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction and six had vesico-ureteric junction obstruction. The indication for surgery was a combination of an obstructed renogram with symptoms of either pain or pyelonephritis. Most children (41) had < 40% function on the affected side before surgery, with just two having hyperfunction (> 55%). In all patients intravenous urography before surgery showed hydronephrosis, and a micturating cystogram was used to exclude coexisting reflux in the presence of an associated megaureter. Diuretic renography (using 99mTc-mercaptoacetyl triglycine or 123I-hippuran) and DMSA scintigraphy were both carried out before surgery and the renography repeated 6 months afterward."

CD009185,0,9401513,0,Soluble receptors to tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-6 in urine during acute pyelonephritis.,"We compared the urinary concentrations of soluble TNF-I (sTNF-RI), TNF-II receptors, and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) standardized to urinary creatinine concentrations, in children with acute pyelonephritis, in children with non-renal fever and in healthy controls. These levels were related to the acute inflammatory response in the kidneys and later renal scarring, as determined by acute and 1-y follow-up with 99mTC-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA). The concentrations of the soluble receptors were measured using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The urinary levels of sTNF-RI were significantly higher in children with acute pyelonephritis (median 1320 pg/mmol) than in children with non-renal fever, children 6 weeks after acute pyelonephritis and healthy controls (873, 251 and 477 pg/mumol, respectively). Median sTNF-RII urine levels were also higher in acute pyelonephritis (4123 pg/mumol) than in the three control groups (2000, 964 and 1850 pg/mumol, respectively). In contrast, the highest urinary sIL-6R concentrations were found in healthy children (median 420 pg/mumol), compared to those with acute pyelonephritis (235 pg/mumol), children with non-renal fever and children 6 weeks after pyelonephritis (137 and 50 pg/mumol, respectively). No significant difference was found in any of the urinary soluble receptor levels in children with or without DMSA uptake defects at the acute or the 1-y follow-up scintigraphy. In conclusion, although the urinary soluble TNF receptor levels were higher during acute pyelonephritis, this observation was not useful for deciding which children needed follow-up after acute pyelonephritis."

CD009185,0,3706296,0,Splenic hypofunction in the nephrotic syndrome of childhood.,"The reticuloendothelial system, including the spleen, subserves important immunologic functions. Loss of splenic function results in an increased incidence of severe bacterial infections and is accompanied by thrombocytosis. Several nephrotic children were noted to have remarkably high platelet counts and predisposition to bacterial infection with encapsulated organisms. We, therefore, investigated the splenic function of nine children with primary nephrotic syndrome and measured the phagocytic function of the spleen by sequestration of Technetium-99-labelled heat-treated autologous RBC, administered intravenously. Four children had decreased splenic function. Repeat studies performed in two of these children after remission of the nephrotic syndrome gave normal results. There were six episodes of bacterial infection (3 peritonitis, 1 septic arthritis, 1 cellulitis, and 1 Escherichia coli urinary tract infection) among the four patients with decreased splenic function. There were no episodes of bacterial infection among the five nephrotic children with normal splenic function. Nephrotic patients with decreased splenic function had significantly increased platelet counts (921,000 +/- 196,000; mean +/- SEM) compared to those with normal function (435,000 +/- 46,000; P less than 0.001). Our findings suggest the possibility that some nephrotic children may have decreased splenic function in association with increased susceptibility to bacterial infections."

Procalcitonin (PCT) concentration is a new marker of severe bacterial and fungal infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of PCT concentration assessment in the diagnosis of uncomplicated infective endocarditis of bacterial etiology. The study group consisted of 30 patients with ongoing infective endocarditis in the course of acquired valvular heart disease. The diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis was established according to the Duke criteria on the basis of: clinical examination, laboratory investigations (inflammatory parameters, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography) and positive blood cultures. Patients with sepsis, concomitant infections and in an early postoperative period were excluded. Two control groups consisted of: 10 patients without endocarditis and other infections and another 10 patients without endocarditis and with an urinary tract infection. Serum procalcitonin concentrations were measured by an immunoluminometric assay (LUMItest PCT set). Mean serum PCT concentrations in patients with endocarditis (0.12 +/- 0.13, range 0-0.4 ng/ml) were significantly higher than in control group without infection (0.03 +/- 0.05, range 0-0.1 ng/ml) and higher than in control group with an urinary tract infection (0.02 +/- 0.04, range 0-0.1 ng/ml).

CD009185,0,18844487,0,Is serum procalcitonin able to predict long-term kidney morbidity from urinary tract infections in children?,"A new diagnostic strategy for children with febrile urinary tract infections could be the routine use of procalcitonin assessment to identify children requiring closer follow-up since being at risk for kidney damage. A total of 11 studies were published between 1998 and 2007. Children with very high procalcitonin levels during urinary tract infections are likely to be at risk of renal damage and vesico-ureteral reflux. Therefore, the prediction of long-term renal damage showed contradictory results. However, high procalcitonin values at diagnosis and positive scintigraphic scans may suggest the need to investigate for vesico-ureteral reflux. Consequently, procalcitonin levels should be included in follow-up protocols for urinary tract infections to aid in decision making concerning scintigraphic scans and voiding cystourethrograms."

During the course of the treatment, nimesulide plus antibiotics induced a significantly greater and more rapid improvement of the treated patients in comparison with antibiotics plus placebo, in case of prostate swelling, redness, oedema, compulsion, pollakiuria, nycturia and body temperature. The assessment on efficacy expressed by the investigator and the patient was significantly better in the case of antibiotic plus nimesulide as compared to the antibiotic treatment alone (p less than 0.01). With the improvement of clinical complaints, there resulted a significant reduction of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and of white blood cell count. In the antibiotic plus nimesulide treatment group, the laboratory parameters used as a control for the tolerability of the drug did not show any significant variation. There were no side-effects reported."

With the total number of scars serving as the gold standard, the sensitivity (94%) and specificity (100%) in identifying renal scars in children were highest for the DMSA scan. Intraobserver (95%) and interobserver (90%) reliability were also high for the DMSA scan. However, the clinical interpretation of the increased sensitivity of the DMSA scan is unknown. Changes on the scan not identified by intravenous urography may not represent true scars. Research into the long-term significance of these scars is indicated."

However, postnatal management of AHN is controversial. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes of infants with AHN and to contribute to the definition of the postnatal evaluation of these patients. One hundred and thirty-six infants with AHN were prospectively followed up to 18 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to the degree of sonographic hydronephrosis (HN) on days 5-7: group I (n = 87, 64%) included patients who had grades 1 and 2 (64%) and group II (n = 49, 36%) included patients who had grade 3 and above HN. The grade of HN was found to be correlated with the increased risk of urologic pathologies. Frequency of vesicoureteral reflux was found to be significantly lower in patients with mild HN (6%) as compared to patients with severe AHN (29%) (p = 0.005). In addition, the risk of urinary tract infection increases with increasing grades of HN (10% vs. 29%, p = 0.006). The frequency of spontaneous resolution in patients with mild AHN (64%) was also significantly higher than in patients with severe HN (29%) (p < 0.001). The degree of AHN can be used for making decision about further diagnostic imaging and treatment. Our results strongly suggest that low-grade HN is a relatively self-limited condition and needs minimal investigation. In contrast, the outcome of more severe degrees of AHN needs clarification."

Bacterial markers including white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been studied and are widely used as predictors of SBI in febrile children. It has been suggested that CRP values should be interpreted cautiously when fever has been present <12 h based on the kinetics of this biological marker.

Two months before admission, he was admitted to another hospital with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. One week before admission, he had a fever which was judged to be due to pyelonephritis. Because imipenem cilastatin and minocycline were not effective in relieving symptoms, he was transferred to our hospital. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was cultured from the blood, and vancomycin was started on the 5th hospital day. Because of the persistent fever and signs of inflammation, Gallium-scintigraphy was performed, showing abnormal accumulation in the left fronto-parietal region of the brain and the sacral region. Enhanced brain CT revealed a crescentic low density area and a fine, intense line of enhancement in the left fronto-parietal region. An emergency drainage of abscess was performed via single left fronto-parietal burr hole. A slightly yellowish, bloody, purulent fluid was obtained. The subdural space was irrigated with saline containing antibiotics and a drain was inserted. MRSA was cultured from the obtained fluid. The fever gradually subsided and drowsiness disappeared. He had had decubitus ulcer, stage I on the surface, in the sacral region, which later turned out to have unexpectedly deep undermining lesion reaching to periosteum. MRSA was cultured from this decubitus lesion. MRSA which entered into blood stream from the decubitus site might have been implanted in the subdural hematoma. Thus, subdural abscess should be kept in mind as an active differential diagnosis in elderly patients with fever and drowsiness."

Both agents are characterized by a wide spectrum and potent activity. Furthermore, ceftriaxone has an outstanding serum half-life of 8 h. 41 patients with pelvic inflammatory disease, pelvic or wound infections after vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy, endomyometritis and urinary-tract infection were included. Patients were monitored clinically by routine laboratory methods (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cell count and cross-reacting protein) and bacteriologically. Clinical parameters of infection were fever, local pain and/or tenderness, a sactosalpinx or pyosalpinx at palpation and cervical secretion. Clinical cure was achieved in 77.3% in the ceftriaxone and in 78.9% in the cefotaxime group, improvement in 3 (13.6%) and 4 patients (21.0%), respectively. 2 clinical failures were seen in the ceftriaxone group. One was a severe pelvic infection following vaginal hysterectomy, which responded to the addition of metronidazole, the other was due to a chlamydial salpingitis, which was cured with a 10-day course of doxycycline.

MR findings were correlated with findings of quantitative (Tc-99m-DMSA) scintigraphy, and histology. On noncontrast T1-weighted images, the normal porcine kidney demonstrated good corticomedullary contrast (CMC = 16.8% +/- 5.0). Five minutes after administration of Gd-DTPA, there was enhancement of the renal cortex (+24.4% and medulla (+46.2%), and CMC was no longer discernible. Enhancement of the urine within the collecting system (+119.1%) was also observed. The obstructed kidneys demonstrated marked thinning of the renal parenchyma and decreased signal intensity on noncontrast T1- and T2-weighted images (P less than 0.01). Urine in the dilated collecting system did not differ significantly from urine in controls except in the three animals with urinary tract infection (P less than 0.05). Five minutes following injection of Gd-DTPA, there was enhancement of the renal parenchyma in all kidneys. Excretion was seen in three pigs and no excretion in two.

Follow-up DMSA scan was carried out after 6 months. Twenty-one of 102 of initial DMSA studies showed diminished uptake of radionuclide and 12 showed cortical scarring. Twenty-nine patients had significant vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The finding of diminished uptake on the initial scan was significantly associated with fever, systemic upset, length of symptoms and a peripheral blood leucocytosis, (p less than 0.05). In addition the finding was associated with fever and loin pain in the older child. Both diminished uptake and scarring were more common in refluxing kidney units.

Although UTIs do not occur with as great a frequency in children as in adults, they can be a source of significant morbidity in children. For reasons that are not yet completely understood, a minority of UTIs in children progress to renal scarring, hypertension and renal insufficiency. Clinical presentation of UTI in children may be nonspecific, and the appropriateness of certain diagnostic tests remains controversial. The diagnostic work-up should be tailored to uncover functional and structural abnormalities such as dysfunctional voiding, vesicoureteral reflux and obstructive uropathy. A more aggressive work-up, including renal cortical scintigraphy, ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography, is recommended for patients at greater risk for pyelonephritis and renal scarring, including infants less than one year of age and all children who have systemic signs of infection concomitant with a UTI.

Besides one patient with group B Streptococcus bacteremia at 1.5 months of age, all bacteremias after one month of age were with E. coli. Bacteremia was limited to those < 6 months old and inversely related to age (R = 0.24, P = 0.0008). Grouped by age, the incidence of bacteremia was 21% for 0 < or = 1 month, 13% for 1.1-2.0 months, 4% for 2.1-3.0 months, and 8% for 3.1-6.0 months. Mean white blood cell count, initial temperature, initial serum bicarbonate, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were not statistically significant between bacteremic (B) and nonbacteremic (NB) patients. Statistically significant differences were noted for percentage of bands (6.2% [NB] vs. 12.3% [B] P < 0.001), total band count (1048 [NB] vs. 2252 [B] P < 0.001), and band-neutrophil ratio (0.16 [NB] vs. 0.36 [B] P = 0.01); however, no practical value for any of these measures would reliably discriminate between bacteremic and nonbacteremic patients. Four patients, all neonates, had meningitis; too few patients with meningitis were identified for analysis. In summary, bacteremia with UTIs was observed to be inversely related to age and limited to patients less than six months of age. No objective parameters were identified to distinguish patients with bacteremia at the time of presentation."
CD009185,0,1343562,1,99mTechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children: relation to clinical and radiological findings.,"Seventy-two children, 59 girls and 13 boys, 0.1-15.9 (median 1.1) years of age, with acute pyelonephritis (APN) were investigated with the aid of a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, renal ultrasonography (US) and a desmopressin test within 5 days of admission. Sixty-two children were reinvestigated approximately 2 months later when intravenous urography (IVU) and micturition cysto-urethrography were also performed. During infection, 92% of the children showed changes in the DMSA scan with 69% by US, and the two investigations agreed in 58% of the kidneys. At follow-up, 68% showed changes in the DMSA scan, 47% by US and 48% by IVU. The DMSA scan and IVU agreed in 60% of the kidneys. Twenty-nine percent of the children had vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). The presence of grade greater than or equal to 3 VUR was associated with greater defects on the DMSA scan during infection, and at follow-up with a higher frequency of persistent changes compared with no VUR (P less than 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). During infection the size of the defect on the DMSA scan correlated with renal volume and C-reactive protein and inversely with the glomerular filtration rate, and at follow-up it correlated inversely with the renal concentration capacity. The DMSA scan is a sensitive method for diagnosing and localizing APN in children, and findings on DMSA scan show a weak but significant correlation with routine clinical and radiological parameters. It is suggested that persistent renal damage after APN in children without VUR may be more common than previously assumed."
CD009185,0,8192006,0,Risk factors in the development of early renal cortical defects in children with urinary tract infection.,"Defects seen on early cortical scintigrams of the renal cortex in children with urinary tract infection may represent acute inflammatory change or established scar. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between these defects and age, sex, the presence and grade of vesicoureteral reflux, and infective organism in a cohort of children examined after their first proved urinary tract infection."
CD009185,0,12579398,0,Renin-angiotensin system polymorphisms and renal scarring.,"The purpose of the study was to determine whether DNA polymorphisms at the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAS) genes were associated with evolution to renal scar formation and, consequently, with reflux nephropathy (RN) in patients with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Some authors have suggested that the DD genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene would be an adverse renal prognosis factor. We recruited 246 patients (aged 3 months to 22 years) from four Spanish hospitals. These included 69 patients with VUR, 110 with RN (determined by absence/presence of renal scarring on dimercaptosuccinc acid scan), 27 with chronic renal failure due to RN, and 40 patients (control group) with urinary tract infection and normal findings on renal ultrasonography and voiding cystoureterogram. The ACE I/D, angiotensin II type 1 receptor AT1 A1166C, angiotensin II type 2 receptor A3123C AT2, and angiotensinogen AGT M235T polymorphisms were determined on the basis of polymerase chain reaction amplification. ACE serum levels were determined by spectrophotometric methods. We found no statistical differences in the distribution of RAS polymorphisms between the different groups. The ACE D allele was linked to higher ACE serum levels. We found no association between ACE I/D polymorphism and presence of hypertension, proteinuria, grade of VUR, or unilateral/bilateral VUR. Patients with the DD genotype had a lower incidence of febrile urinary tract infection as a first symptom of VUR/RN (P<0.05). We conclude that genetic polymorphisms of RAS components are not independent prognostic indicators of renal scarring in patients with VUR."
CD009185,0,12579399,0,Early treatment of urinary infection prevents renal damage on cortical scintigraphy.,"Diagnosis of urinary infection in young children is often delayed, which may result in renal damage. However, it remains to be clarified how soon the treatment should be started to prevent renal changes. The present study prospectively enrolled young children with diagnosis of their first febrile urinary infection who underwent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinate renal cortical scintigraphy within 120 h of initiation of treatment. Patients with abnormal renoscintigraphy received antibiotics for 2 weeks and scintigraphy was repeated 1 year later. Twenty-two children were enrolled from July 1995 through March 2000. Acute-phase renoscintigraphy identified focal defects in 0 of the 14 children who were treated within 24 h of the disease, 1 of the 3 treated in 24-48 h, and 2 of the 5 treated in 48-72 h. Repeat renoscintigraphy showed disappearance of the focal defects in all 3 children. The present study has shown that early treatment within 24 h of onset of the fever due to urinary infection should deter renal changes. Fever for more than 24 h prior to diagnosis indicates a high risk for renal changes and needs an immediate effective treatment to avoid renal damage."
CD009185,0,12089886,0,[Influence of selected factors on the development of renal scars in children with vesico-ureteric complex].,"Although relationship between vesico-ureteric reflux, urinary tract infection and renal scarring is known, pathogenesis of the renal scarring is still unclear. Vesico-ureteric reflux and urinary tract infection remain in very close relationship, they may also occur separately. The factor promoting renal injury is also young age of a child. The aim of this paper was to analyse the influence of the selected factors, namely: degree of the vesico-ureteric reflux; child's age at reflux diagnosis time as well as the frequency of recurrences of urinary tract infections exerted on reflux nephropathy. In 45 children with diagnosed vesicoureteric reflux the intensity of renal scarring was estimated using planar scintigraphy with DMSA-Tc-99m and a questionnaire was prepared. The questionnaire included information as follows: age at which the diagnosis was established, degree of reflux at the time of diagnosis, treatment applied, frequency of urinary tract infections before and after having taking medical care of children. It was revealed that the degree of scarring correlated with degree of vesico-ureteric reflux of particular kidney. In the investigated group no correlations were found between intensity of renal scarring and both the age of establishing diagnosis and frequency of urinary tract infections before starting the treatment. Taking the obtained results into consideration it seems, that the degree of vesico-ureteric reflux estimated prior to treatment determines degree of renal injuries though, undoubtedly all factors being studied affect renal scarring."

They may be divided into: common infections such as fungal infections, pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, bacteraemia, urinary tract infections, and diabetic foot infections and specific infections. The latter occur almost exclusively in diabetes and include rhinocerebral mucormycosis, malignant external otitis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, perirenal abscess, emphysematous cystitis and emphysematous cholecystitis. Radionuclide tests are decisive in the diagnosis and localisation of foot osteomyelitis, as well as the distinction of osteomyelitis from other conditions, notably Charcot osteoarthropathy. Technetium-99m methylene disphosphonate and labelled leukocyte bone scans are the main imaging techniques employed, while emerging techniques include single-photon emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/CT. Nuclear medicine is also useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of specific infections in diabetes like, malignant external otitis, rhinocerebral mucormycosis, acute pyelonephritis, renal papillary necrosis and cholecystitis. The main indications of nuclear medicine tests are diabetic foot osteomyelitis, malignant external otitis, rhinocerebral mucormycosis and renal infections."

Peripheral venous blood mixed with ehtylenediaminetetraacetic acid was analyzed with a Sysmex E-4000 analyzer. The underlying diseases were sepsis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, and other inflammatory diseases. The mean duration of survival from the onset of DIC was 16.9 +/- 23.9 days. The distribution of red cell sizes before the onset of DIC did not differ significantly from that in patients without DIC, but fragmentation of erythrocytes on blood films was more common in the early stage of DIC (p < 0.01). Before the onset of DIC, the two groups did not differ significantly in the frequency of giant platelets on blood smears. At the onset of DIC, the platelet distribution width, the mean platelet volume, and the platelet-to-large-cell ratio were significantly higher than in patients without DIC. The concentration of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and those of other serum enzymes did not change significantly, but the serum creatinine concentration and the blood urea nitrogen level increased as the platelet-to-large-cell ratio increased. No significant relation was evident between the levels of serum C-reactive protein and creatinine, between the platelet-to-large-cell ratio and the mean volume of red blood cells, or between the platelet-to-large-cell ratio and the distribution of red cell sizes. These data suggest that studies of platelets are more useful in the diagnosis of DIC at early stages of impaired organ function than are other indicators of inflammation such as the level of C-reactive protein."

Some are found to have a renal mass during diagnostic evaluation. In patients with FUOs and a renal mass, the differential diagnosis includes renal tuberculosis, renal cell carcinoma (hypernephroma), renal malakoplakia, and xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. A 68-year-old woman presented with an FUO during her diagnostic workup. She manifested an irregularly enlarged kidney on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, as well as a highly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 100 mm/hour, an elevated serum ferritin level, and chronic thrombocytosis, which favored a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Renal malakoplakia and renal tuberculosis comprised further differential diagnostic considerations. Microscopic hematuria may be present with any of the disorders in the differential diagnosis, but was absent in this case. An abdominal CT scan was suggestive of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. Because of concerns regarding renal cell carcinoma, the patient received a nephrectomy. The pathologic diagnosis was of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, without renal cell carcinoma."
CD009185,0,7779526,0,Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of renal parenchymal damage by 99mTc-DMSA planar and SPECT scintigraphy.,"The initial 99mTc-DMSA studies carried out over a four year period in 229 patients with various heterogenic causes of lower urinary tract abnormalities were reviewed. Anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma was graded by means of planar and SPECT studies into a six group classification proposed by Monsour et al.: grade 0 (normal), I (equivocal), II (single defect), III (more than 2 defects), IV (contracted or small) and V (no visualization). Parenchymal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA was quantitated from planar images at 2 hours postinjection by a computer assisted gamma camera method. SPECT studies could enhance the pick-up rate for parenchymal uptake defects by a factor of 1.5 in comparison with planar imaging. The incidence of anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma increased with a high radiological grade for VUR, and renal uptake per injection dose of 99mTc-DMSA by the individual kidney significantly decreased in grades III and IV of the anatomical classification. These data revealed that 99mTc-DMSA planar is still useful for evaluating gross structural damage and for quantitative evaluation of the kidney with computer assistance. SPECT scintigraphy is more effective in disclosing anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma than planar, although it needs further discussion as to whether SPECT may increase sensitivity with minimal or no adverse affect on specificity."

Severe urinary tract anomalies are very often accompanied only by asimptomatic bacteriuria in perinatal period. Three urinalysis ware done after delivery. 212 newborns with significant asimptomatic bacteriuria underwent ultrasound examination, and were followed up to three months. Those with normal findings and with passing bacteriuria in the first 2 months were excluded. Group of 52 newborns underwent radioisotope examination. Frequency of urinary tract anomalies in newborns was 34.6%.

In this research we investigated the use of 99mTc DMSA scanning in the localization of renal parenchymal involvement in urinary tract infection. Twenty-four children presenting with first acute urinary tract infection were studied. Investigations included physical examination, white blood cell count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) and early 99mTc DMSA scanning. 99mTc DMSA scanning was taken as the gold standard method in determining renal parenchymal inflammation. According to the 99mTc DMSA scanning the sensitivity of clinical findings was 57.14%, WBC 23.80%, ESR 33.33%, CRP 14.28% and ACB 71.42% in the localization of urinary tract infection. We propose early 99mTc DMSA scanning performed around the time of infection as a good technique for localization of the level of infection in the urinary tract."

CD009185,0,16373252,0,Infections and SLE.,"Viral and bacterial infections may serve as an environmental trigger for the development or exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the genetically predetermined individual. In addition, SLE patients are more prone to develop common (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, sepsis), chronic (tuberculosis), and opportunistic infections possibly due to inherit genetic and immunologic defects (complement deficiencies, mannose-binding lectin [MBL] polymorphisms, elevated Fcgamma III and GM-CSF levels, osteopontion polymorphism), but also due to the broad spectrum immunosuppressive agents that are part of therapy for severe manifestations of the disease. Hence, SLE patients are considered a high-risk population, where identification and treatment of chronic infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B or human immunodeficiency virus, are important prior to the institution of immunosuppression so as to prevent reactivation or exacerbation of the infection. Infections in SLE patients remain a source of morbidity and mortality. A caveat often encountered is to distinguish between a lupus flare and an acute infection; in such cases parameters including elevated CRP (and adhesion molecules) may aid in the diagnosis of infection. Recent research has provided convincing evidence that EBV infection may play a major role not only in molecular mimicry but also in aberrations of B cells and apoptosis leading to a state of perpetual heightened immune response in SLE."

The median standardized IL-1 alpha creatinine quotient in children with first-time acute pyelonephritis was 3.6 pg/mumol, but was nondetectable in children with recurrent pyelonephritis, children with non-renal febrile conditions and children convalescent after acute pyelonephritis (p < 0.05-0.01). IL-lra levels were also significantly higher in children with acute first-time pyelonephritis (median of 239 pg/mumol) compared to these three groups of children (p < 0.01-0.001). The highest urinary IL-lra levels, however, were found in the healthy controls (median value 1.019; p < 0.001). Both cytokines were higher among children younger than one year compared to older children. The acute IL-1 alpha creatinine quotients were lowest in children with uptake defects on 99mTC-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy both during the acute infection (reflecting the acute inflammation) (p < 0.001) and 1 year after the acute infection (reflecting permanent kidney scarring) (p < 0.001). In conclusion, persisting high urinary levels of IL-1 alpha were associated with less renal inflammation and scarring."

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of VUR and associated renal changes in a group of Arab Kuwaiti children with their first documented febrile UTI and to compare our findings with those reported from other racial groups. One hundred and seventy-four children (38 males and 136 females) fulfilled the study criteria and were divided into three age groups (<1 year, 1-5 years, and >5 years). Patients in each group had both micturating cystourethrography (MCUG) and 99m-Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan after diagnosis. VUR was detected in 39 children (22%). Two-thirds of cases had mild reflux (grade I and II). Females ( n=32) had more reflux than males ( n=7) (24% vs. 18%). Sixty-three patients (36%) had abnormal (DMSA) renal scans (acute pyelonephritis [AP] or renal scars). Of these, 79% were children below 5 years. Abnormal DMSA scans were found in 4 of 38 males (11%) versus 59 of 136 females (43%). Abnormal scans in children with VUR were seen in 1 of 7 males (14%) versus 19 of 32 females (59%). In total, the combination of abnormal scan with VUR occurred in 1 of 38 males (3%) and in 19 of 136 females (14%), whereas abnormal scan without demonstrable VUR was seen in 3 of 38 males (8%) versus 40 of 136 females (29%). Our data showed that the frequency of VUR in Arab Kuwaiti children with febrile UTI is midway between Caucasian and other racial groups. In this study, males had a lower-risk profile than females, the latter having a higher rate of reflux as well as a higher rate of abnormal DMSA scans, irrespective of demonstrable VUR."

CD009185,0,6654939,0,Total hip replacement in the previously septic hip.,"Total hip replacement was performed in either one or two stages in thirty-three hips with active sepsis. The sepsis had followed hemiarthroplasty in six hips, open reduction with internal fixation of a fracture in eight, cup arthroplasty in one, and total hip replacement in eight hips within six years prior to the second total hip replacement. Ten additional patients had total hip replacement following destruction of the hip joint by hematogenous sepsis in nine and by infection following a shrapnel wound in one. Of these thirty-three patients, twenty-three (70 per cent) reveal no signs of infection at three to nine years after prosthetic replacement. Of the remaining ten in whom an infection developed, six had definite recurrences of the original infection, three were infected with organisms different from the original one, and one was either a local recurrence or reseeding from a persistent pyelonephritis. The success rate when the original organism was gram-positive was 78 per cent, including two of three total hip replacements done in the presence of active infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis. The success with gram-negative organisms, however, was only 58 per cent. The prosthetic failure rate was highest in patients who had had a previous infection about a total hip replacement (37 per cent) and in patients who had had a previous infection but no prior prosthetic or internal fixation devices (37 per cent). The lowest prosthetic failure rates were in patients with an infected hemiarthroplasty (16 per cent), an infection around an internal fixation device (25 per cent), or an infected cup arthroplasty. A complete and differential blood-cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, aspiration arthrogram, and radiographs did not effectively predict success or failure. For gram-positive infections, the success rates were similar following either a one or a two-stage procedure. We found that the success rates could be improved by a repeat course of parenteral antibiotics after the total hip replacement even if all preoperative and intraoperative studies failed to identify an infection. Patients with a successful total hip replacement achieved much better functional results than those who had to have a Girdlestone procedure. However, all patients must be carefully assessed prior to reimplantation of a prosthesis because of the high failure rate, especially with gram-negative organisms (Pseudomonas having the gravest prognosis), even when the procedure is done in two stages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

There was 88% concordance between IVU and the DMSA scan, but in 12% there were discrepancies manifested in 37 kidneys from 31 children. Thirty-four kidneys were normal on IVU but showed scars of reflux nephropathy (RN) on the technetium 99m--dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan; 4 of these (2 infants and 2 pre-school children) had severe generalized changes on scanning. Three kidneys were normal of DMSA scan and, although abnormal on initial IVU, were considered to be normal when this was repeated. During a follow-up period of 5 years an annual DMSA was undertaken in 194 patients and the renal scars remained unchanged in all except 1 child. The IVU was repeated 1-3 years after the initial study in 31 children in which the results of the first imaging did not agree. In 28 patients (34 kidneys) in which the initial IVU was normal but the DMSA abnormal, IVU evidence of scarring emerged in 30 of 34 kidneys, including the 4 patients with severe generalized damage on the DMSA. We conclude that abnormalities detected by the DMSA scan may precede the radiological findings, especially in young children. Even severe RN can be established in kidneys that appear normal on the IVU."

The clinical presentations of infected hydronephrosis and pyonephrosis were extremely variable, ranging from no constitutional complaints to urosepsis. Renal sonography detected only 6 of 16 patients with pyonephrosis (specificity 96%, sensitivity 38%, accuracy 72.5%). Using a cutoff value of 3.0 mg./dl. for C-reactive protein and 100 mm. per hour for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the diagnostic accuracy of detecting infected hydronephrosis and pyonephrosis increased to 97%, with a specificity of 89% and sensitivity of 100%. Based on our experience, we believe that the serum C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels can be used as screening tests to distinguish pyonephrosis and infected hydronephrosis from simple, uncomplicated hydronephrosis."

CD009185,0,8623698,0,Diagnostic imaging of patients with acute scrotal pain.,"Common causes of acute scrotal pain include testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis and trauma. Epididymitis in adult men is typically associated with a history of urinary tract infection or prostatitis. Testicular torsion typically presents in young adults with a sudden onset of severe scrotal pain and, frequently, a history of recurrent episodes that have spontaneously resolved. With scrotal trauma, ultrasound may demonstrate testicular fracture, hematoceles and areas of hemorrhage or testicular infarction. Since both epididymitis and testicular torsion present with scrotal pain and swelling, and may be accompanied by fever and pyuria, Doppler ultrasound or radionuclide imaging may be necessary to make the diagnosis. In acute testicular torsion, color Doppler ultrasound shows absent flow to the epididymis and testis, while nuclear imaging shows central photon-deficient areas in the ischemic hemiscrotum. In epididymo-orchitis, color Doppler ultrasound shows increased flow to the epididymis and testis, while nuclear imaging shows increased perfusion of the affected testis and hemiscrotum."

CD009185,0,6872263,0,N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and NAG isoenzymes in children with upper and lower urinary tract infections.,"The use of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) to diagnose the site of urinary tract infection was studied in pediatric patients. Differentiation between upper and lower tract infections (UTI) was based on clinical grounds and on elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and fever. NAG excretion expressed as nmol X h-1 X mg-1 of urinary creatinine was higher in children with upper UTI (mean +/- SE 906 +/- 236) than in those with lower UTI (145 +/- 23) or healthy children (151.6 +/- 10) (p less than 0.01 by Duncan's test). In children with upper UTI, NAG excretion fell in parallel with the remission due to antibiotic treatment. This however was not seen in children treated with aminoglycosides. A specific and significant elevation (p less than 0.01) of the B isoenzyme of NAG was documented in children with upper UTI but not in those with lower UTI (B form in upper UTI 49.2% +/- 3.9 versus 21.9 +/- 3.3 in lower UTI; healthy children 18.9 +/- 3.4). The percentage of B isoenzyme excreted was high in two children with upper UTI but was low total NAG urinary excretion, suggesting that the quantification of isoenzymes offers further specificity in diagnosis. We conclude that the measurement of NAG and its isoenzymes in children with UTI provides useful information in the diagnosis of the site of infection."
CD009185,0,23115037,0,Adenylate cyclase and the cyclic AMP receptor protein modulate stress resistance and virulence capacity of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.,"In many bacteria, the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) interacts with the transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP), forming active cAMP-CRP complexes that can control a multitude of cellular activities, including expanded carbon source utilization, stress response pathways, and virulence. Here, we assessed the role of cAMP-CRP as a regulator of stress resistance and virulence in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the principal cause of urinary tract infections worldwide. Deletion of genes encoding either CRP or CyaA, the enzyme responsible for cAMP synthesis, attenuates the ability of UPEC to colonize the bladder in a mouse infection model, dependent on intact innate host defenses. UPEC mutants lacking cAMP-CRP grow normally in the presence of glucose but are unable to utilize alternate carbon sources like amino acids, the primary nutrients available to UPEC within the urinary tract. Relative to the wild-type UPEC isolate, the cyaA and crp deletion mutants are sensitive to nitrosative stress and the superoxide generator methyl viologen but remarkably resistant to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and acid stress. In the mutant strains, H(2)O(2) resistance correlates with elevated catalase activity attributable in part to enhanced translation of the alternate sigma factor RpoS. Acid resistance was promoted by both RpoS-independent and RpoS-dependent mechanisms, including expression of the RpoS-regulated DNA-binding ferritin-like protein Dps. We conclude that balanced input from many cAMP-CRP-responsive elements, including RpoS, is critical to the ability of UPEC to handle the nutrient limitations and severe environmental stresses present within the mammalian urinary tract."
CD009185,0,6840178,0,Clinical effect and pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim-sulphadiazine in children with urinary tract infections.,"The clinical effect and pharmacokinetics of the combination trimethoprim (TMP)-sulphadiazine (SD) were studied in 18 children with acute urinary tract infections (UTI), aged 2-56 months. A suspension of TMP-SD (9 + 41 mg/ml) was taken orally twice daily for 10 days. Various doses of TMP (2.9-3.7 mg/kg/day) and SD (12.9-16.7 mg/kg/day) were also given to children of different ages. After 2-4 days of treatment, bacterial cultures of urine were negative and C-reactive protein in serum, WBC count and ESR in all patients had become normal. Steady state serum levels for both components were reached after 4 or more days of treatment. At steady state, mean peak serum concentrations of TMP and SD of 1.4 micrograms/ml and 27 micrograms/ml, respectively, were found within 2-4 h after a fasting morning dose. The biological half-lives of TMP and SD were of the same order of magnitude, but the total clearance of TMP was 5 times greater than that of SD. The concentrations of TMP-SD in urine were invariably more than 10 times the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for the causative organisms (tested at the ratios 1:20 and 1:4 of TMP and SD). Non-metabolized SD constituted 77% of total SD in urine of infants, and 55% of total SD in children of 1 year or more. The TMP-SD combination showed a satisfactory clinical effect and favourable pharmacokinetic properties in children with UTI."
CD009185,0,10201035,0,Renal sinus hyperechogenicity in acute pyelonephritis: description and pathological correlation.,"This paper reports on the association between renal sinus hyperechogenicity and acute pyelonephritis. The medical records and imaging studies of 18 children displaying this pattern were retrospectively studied. Thickening of the renal pelvis and renal enlargement were the most frequent associated sonographic abnormalities. Further subtle findings can be found on sonography and colour/power Doppler. Their identification can help in the diagnostic approach to acute pyelonephritis and may obviate the need for other imaging modalities such as enhanced CT or 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. Renal sinus hyperechogenicity was also identified in a parallel study performed in female rabbits with experimental pyelonephritis and was shown, histologically, to be related to exudates of fibrin and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, interstitial oedema and micro-abscesses."
CD009185,0,20073403,0,[Imaging and follow-up of children with first febrile Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)].,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children might, in a minority of cases, cause renal scarring and permanent damage. Known risk factors for renal damage are: obstruction to urinary flow, vesicoureteric reflux and recurrent infections. The current recommendations for imaging and follow-up of children with first febrile UTI include renal ultrasound to rule out anatomic abnormalities, particularly obstruction, cystography for possible diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux, and prophylactic antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrent infections in children with detected reflux. DMSA renal scanning for the detection of renal scars is recommended as part of the imaging protocol by some institutions. Recently, published data doubts the importance of the various imaging techniques, as well as the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic therapy. In the current review, the role of renal ultrasound is examined, especially with regards to familiar data from fetal ultrasound. The complex relationship between vesicoureteric reflux and renal scarring is presented, with the possible implications on the importance of performing routine cystography and DMSA scanning after UTI. Studies questioning the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic therapy emphasize the importance of rapid diagnosis and therapy of suspected recurrent UTI as the preferred approach to prevent renal damage. Imaging studies are only recommended for high risk groups and not as a routine following UTI."

CD009185,0,21196618,0,Determination and comparison of mean random urine calcium between children with vesicoureteral reflux and those with improved vesicoureteral reflux.,"Urinary reflux can cause irreversible complications such as reflux nephropathy and ESRD. Diagnostic imaging such as voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is invasive and causes irradiation. Several studies have shown that markers such as urine IL-8 or serum Procalcitonin might be useful for the diagnosis of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) as a substitution for invasive methods. The aim of this study was to determine and compare the mean urine Ca/Cr ratio and hypercalciuria between two groups of children aged 2-10 years affected by VUR. This is a cross-sectional study in which 32 children having the following entrance criteria were included: children 2-10 years old not affected by urinary tract infection during the last three months and their reflux or recovery having been diagnosed by VCUG or direct radionuclide cystography, divided into two groups of affected by reflux and recovered from reflux. Then, the point urine specimens were collected with permission of their parents in a single laboratory and urine Ca and Cr for each specimen were measured. The Ca/Cr ratio was calculated for each child to evaluate Ca excretion from the urine, which was possible without collecting the 24-hours urine. The Ca/Cr ratio mean and the hypercalciuria were compared between the groups. To analyze our data, the Mann-Whiney test and the Chi-square test were used, using SPSS V.15. Thirty-two children, including 18 children recovered from reflux and 14 affected by reflux, were entered in our study. The Ca/Cr ratio mean was 0.692 ± 1.874 for the affected and 0.118 ± 0.187 for the recovered group. The Ca/Cr ratio mean for the affected male and female groups was 0.012 ± 0.008 and 0.805 ± 1.0913, respectively. This amount was 0.0175 ± 0.01767 for the recovered male and 0.131 ± 0.195 for the recovered female group. There was no significant statistical difference between the groups with respect to the Ca/Cr ratio mean, but there was a significant statistical difference between the two groups of females (P-value = 0.026). Also, there was no significant statistical difference between the two groups of males relative frequency of hypercalciuria was significantly higher in the group affected by reflux than in the recovered from reflux group (P-value = 0.017). Urine Ca excretion is elevated in children with reflux, and may be more useful as an appropriate marker for the diagnosis of VUR than other invasive methods."
CD009185,0,17493220,0,Frequency of urinary tract infection in pediatric liver transplantation candidates.,"An increased frequency of infections has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease. The tendency of patients in this population to acquire UTI is not completely understood. We aimed at investigating the incidence of UTI in children with cirrhosis, before liver transplantation. Twenty-six children (9 girls, 17 boys; mean age, 7.66 +/- 5.73 yr) with chronic liver disease who had undergone liver transplantation between 2002 and 2004 were included. On admission for liver transplantation, patients were examined for presence of UTI. Serum biochemistry, complete blood cell count, urinalysis and culture, glomerular filtration rate, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed prior to liver transplantation. Ten of 26 patients (38.5%) were found to have symptomatic UTI. Urine cultures revealed E. coli in five (50%), Klebsiella pneumoniae in three (30%), Enterococcus faecalis in one (10%), and Enterobacter aeruginosa in one (10%) patient(s), respectively, as etiologic factors. The etiologies of chronic liver disease in our patients with UTI were BA in five, PFIC in three, Wilson's disease in one, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in one patient. We found a significantly greater number of UTIs in patients with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia (p < 0.05). The mean age of the patients with UTI was 2.75 +/- 3.49 yr, which was significantly lower than in those without UTI (9.75 +/- 4.86 yr, p < 0.05). Levels for white blood cells, thrombocytes, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in patients with UTI than in those without UTI. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to serum albumin, bilirubin, AST, GGT, BUN, or creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate, duration of disease, and PELD scores. In patients with bacteriuria, renal USG revealed normal findings in all, but except one patient who had pelvicalyceal dilatation. Scintigraphic findings demonstrated acute pyelonephritis in six (60%) patients with UTI. VCUG demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in two patients. In conclusion, symptomatic UTI is common in children with cirrhosis. It occurs more frequently in patients with biliary atresia than it does in patients with other types of chronic liver disease. In febrile children with chronic liver disease, UTI should be considered in the differential diagnosis."
CD009185,0,6887361,0,Noninvasive localization of urinary tract infection: clinical investigations and experience.,"Previously we evaluated new methods to localize the source of bacteriuria in monkeys with experimental urinary tract infection. A high level of diagnostic accuracy was obtained with studies of antibody coating of urinary bacteria by immunofluorescence, 131iodine hippuran quantitative scintillation camera studies with the patient in the hydropenic state and 67gallium citrate scintiphotos. We identified unique patterns that differentiated cystitis, ureteritis, pyelonephritis and renal or perinephric abscess. Herein we review our clinical experience with these combined techniques in 40 patients and correlate the degree of accuracy of these studies with that of standard radiographic examinations. In 20 patients diagnostic studies also were compared to the findings of split ureteral urine cultures or bacteriologic culture of renal tissue obtained from surgical specimens or autopsy. The use of the quantitative scintillation camera studies done with the patient in a state of controlled hydropenia increased clearly the level of diagnostic sensitivity in demonstrating the source of a urinary tract infection compared to urine culture and excretory urography alone. In patients with an abnormal 131iodine hippuran study the performance of 67gallium renal imaging on the same day usually provided information that allowed specific localization of the source and extent of an infection. Both studies must be performed with a high degree of resolution over the renal areas and then must be interpreted carefully to ensure accuracy. Study of antibody coating of urinary bacteria was helpful in suggesting the presence or absence of upper urinary tract disease but was less sensitive and accurate than the combined radionuclide studies."
CD009185,0,11197988,0,Renal cortical scintigraphy and diuresis renography in infants and children.,"Renal scintigraphy is performed frequently in infants and children. Renal cortical scintigraphy using 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid is predominantly performed to assess the renal sequelae of urinary tract infection. It is most commonly performed for the evaluation of chronic renal scars, although it is also undertaken in the assessment of acute pyelonephritis. Diuresis renography using 99mTc mercaptoacetyltriglycine is of great use in the evaluation of renal tract obstruction, which may occur at a variety of levels, but most commonly occurs at the ureteropelvic junction. Consensus statements have been formulated in an attempt to standardize methods of performing these investigations. However, several areas of controversy exist in the performance of these studies, and these are outlined. Radionuclide cystography and renal function estimation using clearance calculations are not covered in this article."

CD009185,0,8972785,0,Early detection of infected ureteral obstruction after SWL employing C-reactive protein.,"Infection of the obstructed upper urinary tract is a severe complication of stone disease. Early detection and therapy is crucial to prevent septicemia. The authors investigated prospectively whether C-reactive protein (CRP) might act as a marker for the early detection of infected upper urinary tract obstruction. The serum concentration of CRP was compared with the classic markers of inflammation--white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and temperature--in the follow-up of 85 patients undergoing 173 extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) treatments. Post-SWL, 69% of the patients showed dilation of the upper tract on ultrasonography and 16.5% became symptomatic and required intervention. In this group, the mean CRP value was increased 18-fold, whereas the WBC count, ESR, and temperature were not markedly raised. In contrast, patients with no need for additional treatment showed no more than a 2-fold increase in CRP. C-Reactive protein seems to be a useful indicator for the early detection of infected upper urinary tract obstruction."
CD009185,0,1328692,0,Use of 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid to study patterns of renal damage associated with prenatally detected vesicoureteral reflux.,"Static isotope imaging with 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid was performed at a mean age of 34 days in 32 children (50 kidneys) whose vesicoureteral reflux had been identified as a result of prenatal ultrasound scanning. Three patterns of isotope uptake were observed: 1) noninfected primary vesicoureteral reflux (15 children, 24 kidneys), 2) noninfected secondary (obstructed) vesicoureteral reflux (9 patients, 11 kidneys) and 3) infected primary reflux (8 infants, 15 kidneys). In 20 pattern 1 kidneys (83%) renal morphology and differential isotope were normal. In the 4 kidneys (17%) that showed evidence of impaired function this took the form of global parenchymal loss, that is small kidneys rather than focal scarring. In pattern 2 the combination of fetal vesicoureteral reflux and obstruction was a potent cause of renal damage with total or near total loss of function in 7 of 9 refluxing units associated with posterior urethral valves and in 2 kidneys with secondary ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Appearances of focal scarring were confined in pattern 3 and were found in 4 kidneys (27%). This overall incidence of detectable renal damage was lower than expected. Even when infection occurs, prenatal diagnosis may lessen the risk of scarring by enabling treatment to be instituted promptly. The findings suggest that uncomplicated primary vesicoureteral reflux is a relatively benign insult to the fetal kidney and that reflux nephropathy found in children presenting clinically is the result of infected vesicoureteral reflux in postnatal life. Any comparison of published studies will prove difficult until there is a more standardized approach to imaging technique and patient selection."

Children were randomized after 3 days of intravenous treatment. Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was performed within the first days after admission and repeated 6 months later. Total or partial persistence of renal abnormalities on the 6-month DMSA scintigraphy was used as the endpoint of the study. Among the 92 children included in the study, 87 were followed for at least 6 months (43 in group A and 44 in group B) and were eligible for analysis. Late DMSA was abnormal in 9 kidneys of group A and 12 kidneys of group B, representing respectively 24% and 44% of kidneys with abnormalities on the initial DMSA (difference statistically not significant). When the patients were stratified according to the delay of treatment, the percentage of patients with sequelae in group A was comparable, whether the delay was less or more than 1 week. In group B, the percentage of patients with sequelae was significantly higher (P<0.01) when the delay was more than 1 week."

Two patterns of response could be identified: responders and non-responders whose therapy had to be changed. Mean values for each acute phase protein were calculated daily in both responders and non-responders. Statistical evaluation of the significance between the means for each protein was also performed on a daily basis and showed P < 0.01 for SAA and CRP on day 3, for ACT on day 5, and for AGP on day 6.

CD009185,0,16082551,0,Evaluation of acute pyelonephritis with DMSA scans in children presenting after the age of 5 years.,"It is generally believed that infants are more susceptible to development of renal scarring after pyelonephritis than children over 5 years old. This view has led to differences in investigations and treatment according to age. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the occurrence of renal parenchymal lesion in children over 5 years admitted with a first-time symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). Between October 2000 and April 2002, 52 children aged over 5 years who were admitted to our department with probable acute pyelonephritis (APN) and a positive urine culture were included in this study. All children received antibiotics for 14 days. During the acute phase of infection, scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and ultrasonography (US) were done. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed in all children early in the course of the illness, generally within 5-7 days of hospitalization. When scintigraphy showed renal parenchymal changes, repeat scintigraphy was done after at least 3 months to assess the progression of renal abnormalities. Of the 52 children with a first-time documented pyelonephritis, cortical scintigraphy showed renal lesion in 41 children (78.8%). US was normal in all children with normal renal scintigraphy, while it detected renal abnormalities in 16 of the 41 (39 %) with abnormal scintigraphy (p <0.0001). Topographic analysis of the 165 focal lesions showed that 42.4% were localized to the upper poles, 17.5% to the middle third, and 40% to the lower poles of the kidneys. Repeat scintigraphy showed persistent lesions corresponding to those on the initial scan in nine (28.2%) of the 32 children. Renal lesions had partly regressed in 23 (71.8%) of the patients who underwent repeat scintigraphy. Vesicoureteral reflux was observed in 13.4% of kidneys and renal parenchymal abnormalities were identified in 71.4% and 72.2% of renal units, respectively, with and without reflux ( p >0.05). In conclusion, our data did not confirm the conventional opinion that the risk of renal scarring after pyelonephritis is low in children over the age of 5 years. Our findings suggest that renal scintigraphy may be a more appropriate method of investigation than VCUG for evaluation of the children over 5 years with acute pyelonephritis. Additionally, the frequency of scintigraphic changes is high, and a strategy based exclusively on ultrasound findings would miss about 61% of the abnormal renal units. We recommend that all children, irrespective of age, will benefit from further investigations that might prevent or limit the development of scarring process and renal complications."

In patients with primary lesions alone, the positive finding rate by 67Ga scanning was low (26%), and in metastatic lesions that by scanning was high (86%).

CD009185,0,2922235,0,"Fever, bacteriuria and concomitant disease in children with urinary tract infection.","A total of 124 children aged 0.2 to 6 years were enrolled in a study of first time febrile urinary tract infection. The patient population was stratified in groups according to the stringency of criteria for fever and bacteriuria and the presence of concomitant disease. The major group of 88 patients consisted of children with fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C measured at the hospital within 24 hours of diagnosis, bacteriuria verified by suprapubic bladder aspiration or repeated cultures of voided urine, but without concomitant disease. These children were mainly infected with attaching Escherichia coli specific for galactose alpha (1----4) beta galactose containing receptors and had laboratory evidence of inflammation. Another group of 11 children were distinguished with strictly defined bacteriuria and concomitant disease. These children were infected with nonattaching bacteria and had lower concentrations of C-reactive protein in serum and lower microsedimentation rates than the major group. Five of these children had a reduction in renal concentrating capacity. The study emphasizes the heterogeneity among patients with fever and bacteriuria but does not rule out the possibility of renal involvement in any subgroup."

CD009185,0,16356021,0,Controversies in the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections in children.,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common childhood bacterial infections, after upper respiratory tract and middle ear infections. The current goal of management is to prevent detrimental effects of UTI by early detection and treatment. Recommendations for the imaging of children depend upon age at presentation and sex. All children aged <5 years who have had a febrile UTI require a radiologic evaluation to identify any underlying genitourinary pathology. Older children can undergo a more tailored work-up depending on whether there is a febrile UTI or cystitis-type symptoms. Dysfunctional voiding and urge syndrome significantly increase the risk of developing UTIs in children. Vesicoureteral reflux can increase the risk of pyelonephritis and renal scarring in children with UTIs. For the most part, pyelonephritis can be diagnosed on clinical grounds in the majority of patients and a subsequent (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan can be reserved to identify post-nephritic renal scarring. When renal scarring is identified, the child and parents need to be educated regarding the possibility of hypertension, proteinuria, progressive nephropathy, and the risk of complications in future pregnancies. Treatment of UTI is started in the unwell child before the culture results are available and subsequently changed to culture-specific antimicrobial therapy. A short course of treatment is required for acute uncomplicated UTIs. A child with acute pyelonephritis requires 10-14 days of antibacterial treatment. The oral route in young children often causes vomiting, which implies therapeutic delay, a well known risk factor for scarring."

They were divided into two groups. Group A included 34 babies (25M/9F) with a prenatal diagnosis of pelvic dilatation. Mean age at presentation was 12 days and no urinary tract infection (UTI) occurred before our first examination. VUR was unilateral in 21 (62%) patients and bilateral in 13 (38%). It was mild (grades I-III) in 12 (25%) refluxing renal units (RRU) and severe (grades IV-V) in 35 (75%). Renal damage (RD) was present, at diagnosis, in 40 (85%) RRU. There was a greater prevalence of abnormal kidneys in male units (88%) than in female units (75%). Group B included 59 infants (22M/37F) less than 1 year old with UTI. The mean age at first examination was 7.6 months. VUR was unilateral in 32 (54%) infants and bilateral in 27 (46%), mild in 60 (70%) RRU and severe in 26 (30%). At diagnosis, 54 (63%) RRU presented RD, which was more common in females (66%) than in males (44%). Our study confirms that primary VUR associated with prenatal hydronephrosis usually affects males and is severe. VUR diagnosed after UTI, instead, is more common in females and is frequently mild. Although in the first type of reflux RD is often present at diagnosis, then probably congenital, it may always progress after UTI; hence the importance of early diagnosis and careful follow-up in each infant with primary VUR."
CD009185,0,2868893,0,Transcriptional activation of a pap pilus virulence operon from uropathogenic Escherichia coli.,"A gene cluster mediating production of pili in uropathogenic Escherichia coli was analysed with respect to regulation of pili synthesis. Two cistrons, papB and papI, were localized upstream of the major pilus subunit gene, papA. The papI-papB-papA region was characterized by nucleotide sequencing and by transcriptional analysis. The papA gene was primarily represented by an 800 nucleotide long transcript but was also co-transcribed with papB as a less abundant 1300 nucleotide long mRNA. Both transcripts presumably terminated at the same site downstream of the papA coding sequence. The weakly expressed papI gene was transcribed in the opposite direction to that of papB and papA. Studies with lacZ operon fusions showed that the papB gene encoded a trans-active effector required for papA transcription. Similarly, the papI gene stimulated papB transcription in trans. Furthermore, full expression of papA was cis dependent upon the papI-papB region. Transcription of the papB gene was shown to be dependent upon cAMP and its receptor protein. A binding site for the cAMP-CRP complex was postulated in the DNA sequence upstream of the papB promoter."
CD009185,0,2173381,0,[Clinical study concerning of latamoxef concentration in the obstructed urinary tract].,"Urinary LMOX concentration was studied in 18 patients with unilateral ureteral obstruction. The concentration of LMOX in the urine from the mild obstructed kidney was 124 to 2,140 micrograms/ml and 10 micrograms/ml in the severely obstructed ones. The difference was probably due to the intensity and the duration of the obstruction. The patient with 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake of less than 3% also had a urinary LMOX concentration of less than 7 micrograms/ml. The above results seem to show that 7 micrograms/ml in urinary LMOX concentration is a significant figure for treatment of UTI. 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake and renal echogram were used to estimate the excretion rate of antibiotics into the urine."

METHODS A prospective study was conducted in 40 infants and young children (78 kidneys were evaluated) with a mean age of 25.9 months (range, 1 to 68 months) who were hospitalized with a first episode of high fever and bacteruria, possibly APN. All children were examined by PDU and Tc-99m DMSA within the first 3 days after admission. Patients with congenital abnormalities, hydronephrosis, and urinary reflux were excluded. RESULTS Twenty-seven of the 78 kidneys appeared abnormal on Tc-99m DMSA, and 20 of them were abnormal on PDU. Fifty-one of 78 kidneys were normal on Tc-99m DMSA, and 3 of 51 appeared diseased on PDU. The accuracy of PDU was 87%, sensitivity was 74%, and specificity was 94%. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were both 87%. When considering the numbers of lesions in 27 kidneys with positive Tc-99m DMSA studies (38 lesions), PDU did not disclose 16 lesions (false-negative results). Thus, the sensitivity of PDU for diagnosing lesions of APN decreased to 58%. CONCLUSIONS A positive PDU finding should obviate the use of Tc-99m DMSA in patients thought to have possible APN. However, because of a large number of false-negative results (26%) and underestimation of the number of pyelonephritic lesions (low sensitivity of 58%), PDU cannot replace Tc-99m DMSA in the diagnosis of APN in children."

CD009185,0,3277231,0,Radiographic evaluation of children with urinary tract infections.,"Any child with urinary tract infection needs a radiologic work-up to determine his or her potential risk for sustaining renal damage. VCUG, either fluoroscopic or isotopic, should always be performed. If the infection responds to treatment and the VCUG is normal, ultrasonography should be performed. However, when the VCUG demonstrates reflux, radionuclide scan or, less preferably, excretory urography is indicated to assess renal parenchymal damage and function. When a urinary tract infection does not respond to treatment, ultrasonography or CT scan should be obtained to check for renal or perirenal abscess. If the findings are normal, medical treatment to control the infection is indicated. Further evaluation of the urinary tract may be temporarily delayed. In an infant with urinary tract infection and sepsis, renal ultrasonography is indicated. If the sonogram is normal, VCUG can be delayed until the infant responds to medical treatment. If ultrasonography is abnormal, VCUG and radionuclide scan such as 99mtechnetium DTPA with furosemide to evaluate gross morphology and function should be obtained. Complicated medical problems, such as urinary tract infection in combination with a history of intravenous drug abuse or with findings of fever and a mass, deserve immediate evaluation with ultrasonography or CT scan. A patient with fever of unknown origin and normal urine culture should have a radionuclide scan using gallium67 citrate or indium111-tagged leukocytes, both of which can demonstrate an extrarenal or unsuspected intrarenal site of infection. A variety of imaging modalities are available today for investigating urinary tract infections in the pediatric patient. Used intelligently, singly or in combination, these examinations provide information for the clinical evaluation as well as short-and long-term management of infections, their causes and complication, and their effect on renal function."

At birth, if abnormalities are confirmed by ultrasound scan other instrumental investigation are needed: cystography, to exclude vesicoureteric reflux, and sequential scintigraphy, to evaluate if obstruction of urinary tract is present or to confirm the suspect of renal agenesis or multicystic dysplasia. Urography could be necessary in some cases. For bilateral uropathy evaluation of renal function with blood tests is required. Early surgery is needed in case of severe obstructive uropathy; if obstruction is mild the patients can be followed with instrumental investigation.

CD009185,0,19352723,1,Urinary proteins in children with urinary tract infection.,"The aim of this study was to test our hypothesis that the urinary excretion of C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1-microglobulin (A1M), retinol-binding protein (RBP) and Clara cell protein (CC16) is increased in children with urinary tract infection (UTI) and relates to renal damage as measured by acute dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Fifty-two children <2 years of age with UTI were enrolled in the study, 44 of whom were febrile. The control group consisted of 23 patients with non-UTI infection and elevated serum CRP (s-CRP) levels. Thirty-six patients had abnormal DMSA uptake, classified as mild, moderate or severe damage (DMSA class 1, 2, 3, respectively). There was a significant association between DMSA class and the excretion of urinary RBP (u-RBP) and u-CC16. There was also a significant difference in u-CRP levels between children with UTI and control children with non-UTI infections, although u-CRP excretion was not significantly correlated to DMSA class. In conclusion, the urinary excretion of the low-molecular-weight proteins RBP and CC16 showed a strong association with uptake defects on renal DMSA scans. The urinary level of CRP seems to distinguish between children with UTI and other febrile conditions. A combination of these biomarkers may be useful in the clinical assessment of children with UTI."

In this retrospective study, we reviewed gallium-67 scan findings in cases of psoas abscess to determine the specific uptake pattern and the usefulness of 67Ga scans in diagnosis and management. Fifteen psoas abscess lesions in 13 patients who had undergone a 67Ga scan during an 8-year period were found in the hospital computer. All but two of the patients had been diagnosed as having fever of unknown origin, urinary tract infection or another irrelevant disease prior to the 67Ga scan. Of the 15 psoas abscess lesions, 12 (80%) could be clearly diagnosed on the basis of the specific 67Ga uptake pattern, in which: (1) the oblique direction of the 67Ga-avid lesion correlates with the orientation of the psoas muscle from the lumbar region to the hip joint region; (2) the lesion does not cross the abdominal midline; (3) the lesion goes through the inguinal region; and (4) the lesion involves at least two-thirds of the whole length of the psoas muscle. The specific features may help in the differentiation of psoas abscess from other intra-abdominal lesions or normal bowel distribution, especially with single-photon emission tomographic images. In 7 of 13 patients (53.8%) the 67Ga scan findings contributed to the clinical management of the patients by first detecting the focus of the infection. Multiple concomitant 67Ga-avid lesions were found in ten patients. In conclusion, the specific features as well as the whole-body survey with 67Ga scan are useful and important in the diagnosis of psoas abscesses and the detection of unexpected concomitant multiple infectious foci in clinically suspicious infectious disease patients."

Several investigators have claimed that because acute-phase Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal-scan results are abnormal in the presence of dilating vesicoureteral reflux, a normal DMSA-scan result makes voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) unnecessary in the primary examination of infants with UTI. To evaluate the accuracy of acute-phase DMSA scanning in identifying dilating (grades III through V) vesicoureteral reflux documented by VCUG in children with a first febrile UTI, we performed a meta-analysis of the accuracy of diagnostic tests as reported from relevant studies identified through the PubMed and Scopus databases. Patient-based and renal unit-based analyses were performed. Overall, 13 cohort studies were identified. Nine studies involved patients younger than 2 years, 3 involved children aged 16 years or younger, and 1 involved exclusively neonates. Girls constituted 22% to 85% of the involved children. Pooled (95% confidence intervals) sensitivity and specificity rates of DMSA scanning were 79% and 53%, respectively, for the patient-based analysis (8 studies) and 60% and 65% for the renal unit-based analysis (5 studies).

Acute-phase DMSA renal scanning cannot be recommended as replacement for VCUG in the evaluation of young children with a first febrile UTI."
CD009185,0,8164447,0,Suppressed antibody and interleukin-6 responses to acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy.,"This study examined the effect of pregnancy on the host response to acute pyelonephritis. Urine and serum samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis and after two weeks, from non-pregnant and pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis. The samples were analyzed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and specific antibody activity to antigens extracted from the Escherichia coli strain infecting each patient. The host response to infection was further quantitated as fever, C-reactive protein, and renal concentrating capacity. Acute pyelonephritis in non-pregnant and pregnant women was accompanied by a significant serum and urine antibody response. The serum antibody response was significantly lower in the pregnant group. The IL-6 levels in serum and urine at diagnosis were significantly higher in the non-pregnant compared to the pregnant women. These results demonstrate that the immunosuppression of pregnancy includes the mucosal IL-6 and specific antibody responses to acute pyelonephritis caused by E. coli."

CD009185,0,11518789,0,An increase in myeloid-related protein serum levels precedes acute renal allograft rejection.,"Upon interaction with activated endothelium, monocytes and neutrophils form complexes of myeloid-related protein 8 (MRP8) (S100A8) and MRP14 (S100A9), two members of the calcium-binding S100 family that are secreted during transendothelial migration. In a pilot study of 20 renal transplant recipients and a validation study of 36 renal transplant recipients, MRP8/14 serum levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 28 d, associated with C-reactive protein and creatinine serum levels, and grouped according to biopsy-proven acute rejection. Serum levels of MRP8/14 but not C-reactive protein were significantly increased for several days during the first 2 wk for the acute rejection groups in both studies (P < 0.005, on day 6 after transplantation). As determined by using receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal cutoff for 100% specificity and high sensitivity (67%) for acute rejection on day 6 after transplantation was calculated to be 4.2 microg/ml for MRP8/14 in the pilot study; this value was confirmed in the validation study. Positive MRP8/14 serum levels preceded acute rejection episodes by a median of 5 d. A 3-d course of intravenous methylprednisolone therapy reduced prerejection MRP8/14 serum levels from 5.7 microg/ml to 3.3 microg/ml (P < 0.05). All MRP8/14 serum levels were below the cutoff during urinary tract infections, delayed graft function, or cytomegalovirus infections, and these values did not differ significantly from control values. It is concluded that the MRP8/14 complex is a very early serum marker suitable for monitoring of acute rejection with high sensitivity and specificity."

The group was comprised of patients without renal disease, and patients with diffuse parenchymal disease, obstructive uropathy, renal cysts and renal tumors. The study was followed by 131I-hippurate renography. We propose a simplified routine procedure with scintiphotos taken 10-15 min after injection for topographic information and 120 min after injection for renal morphology. This procedure allows excellent case finding of diffuse parenchymal disease of a special value in cases of radiological non-visualization. The technique is indicated, when iodine contrast media cannot be used for radiological examinations. DMSA studies, however, do not allow safe functional evaluation in all categories of patients. Neither can obstructive nephropathy be diagnosed unless the renal pelvis is dilated. Renal perfusion studies are contaminated by the perfusion of liver and spleen. Nevertheless, a tentative differentiation between cysts and tumours is possible, the former being hypoperfused the latter hyperperfused. When supplemented with gamma camera 131I-hippurate renography, the total scintigraphic procedure will also include split function determination and run-off evaluation."

This study was undertaken to corroborate SPECT dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphic findings with specific histopathology in acute pyelonephritis. Unilateral vesicoureteral reflux was produced in 19 Yorkshire piglets 3 to 4 weeks old. The bladders of 12 animals were inoculated with Escherichia coli 2 weeks later, after baseline SPECT DMSA scans had been obtained. The animals were then re-imaged at 3 (4), 7 (4) or 14 (4) days after infection and sacrificed for histological evaluation. Seven purposefully uninfected piglets with unilateral reflux served as controls and were followed for up to 6 weeks before imaging and sacrifice. SPECT proved to be 97% sensitive and 93% specific in providing the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. The SPECT findings were manifest by a spectrum of abnormal findings (mottling, striations, inner cortical scalloping and focal cortical defects), which correlated precisely with the extent and severity of cortical involvement in the acute pyelonephritic process. We propose a new classification scheme for SPECT DMSA renal scintigraphic imaging, and believe that this modality is exquisitely sensitive in providing the diagnosis as well as in evaluating the extent of renal parenchymal involvement when acute pyelonephritis is induced in the animal model."

It has been found that combined use of the investigation methods largely increases diagnostic possibilities, significantly expands the data of such invasive procedures as excretory urography, aortography, renal biopsy, and in a number of cases it enables making the diagnosis without applying the invasive procedures. It is advisable to use URS and to determine the enzymatic activity and beta 2-MG concentration in the urine just at the first stage of examining the patients with AH (simultaneously with general clinical methods).

A chronic subdural haematoma was surgical evacuated. Postoperatively, an acute urinary tract infection was treated with ciprofloxacin. Six days later, C-reactive protein was rising and the patient was suffering from intermittent high fever, dyspnoea and severe hypoxaemia. The high-resolution-computed tomography (HRCT) showed an interstitial lung disease in the anterior upper lobe on the left side as well as in the lingula. Assuming a bacterial infection amoxyl/clavulanic acid was started which did not improve the clinical symptoms. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a marked lymphocytosis (87%). Analysis for typical bacterial infections, Tuberculosis, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and Legionella spp. were all negative. Another HRCT scan was made because of worsening of symptoms and this showed rapidly progressive infiltrates in most lobes. An open lingular biopsy showed an interstitial lymphoplasmocytotic infiltrate with some eosinophilic granulocytes and a few scattered giant cell granulomas, consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The patient's symptoms rapidly improved with systemic corticosteroid therapy and another HRCT scan revealed complete remission of pulmonary infiltrates. Ciprofloxacin can induce interstitial pneumonitis with acute respiratory failure. This is an important fact considering that ciprofloxacin is a widely used antibiotic agent in treatment of urinary tract infection."
CD009185,0,8283371,1,Cortical scintigraphy in the evaluation of renal parenchymal changes in children with pyelonephritis.,"We designed a prospective study to evaluate the ability of dimercaptosuccinic acid cortical scintigraphy and ultrasonography to detect renal parenchymal lesions in children with pyelonephritis. One hundred eleven patients 1 week to 16 years of age (median 5.5 months) with a urine culture positive for pathogens were included in the study; cortical scintigraphy and ultrasonography were repeated in 25 children after a mean follow-up of 10.5 months. Cortical scintigraphy showed renal changes in 74 children (67%), and ultrasonography showed renal changes in 39 (35%) (p < 0.001); results of the two examinations were discordant in 49 patients (kappa = 0.19). Children more than 1 year of age had a higher incidence of renal lesions than did younger children (85% vs 66%; p = 0.04). The presence of inflammatory signs (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein) had an 89% sensitivity and a 25% specificity in identifying renal lesions. Among children with renal changes, vesicoureteric reflux was present in 39%. At follow-up examination, 16 children (64%) had scars. Thus we found a high incidence of renal involvement in children with pyelonephritis. We found that cortical scintigraphy is more sensitive than ultrasonography in detecting renal changes, and we believe that it should be added to the initial examination of children with suspected pyelonephritis."

Three groups of patients were compared: group 1, patients with an abnormal lower urinary tract and deteriorating renal function (n = 9); group 2, abnormal lower urinary tract and stable renal function (n = 5); and group 3, normal lower urinary tract and deteriorating renal function (n = 8). Eight of the nine patients in group 1 had multiple scars visible on 99mTc DMSA scans and this correlated with histology when a renal biopsy was performed; the only patient without scars had a transplant glomerulopathy. The presence of scars was associated with either raised intravesical pressures or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Only one patient in each of groups 2 and 3 had visible scars and both these patients had a history of recurrent UTIs. Patients in group 3 with deteriorating renal function due to chronic rejection documented by biopsy did not have cortical scars visible with 99mTc DMSA tomography. 99mTc DMSA scanning with tomography is a useful investigation in the management of renal transplant patients with declining renal function; multiple scars may indicate abnormal lower urinary tract function and are not seen in chronic rejection."

The aim of the study was to find out how the 99mTechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan should be used to investigate UTI, and to follow the development of renal changes during pyelonephritis into subsequent permanent renal damage. All children were investigated with a DMSA scan within 5 days after admission and after 3.9-53.3 (median 9.2) weeks, and 159 were studied again after approximately 2 y (range 1.5-3.9 y). They all underwent micturition cystourethrography at the time of the second study. At the time of infection, the DMSA scan was abnormal in 85% of the children, in 58% at the first follow-up and in 36% at the second follow-up. An abnormal DMSA scan performed within 20 weeks from infection became normal in 38% of cases on the third study, while only 1/10 abnormal DMSA scans performed more than 20 weeks after infection became normal after 1.5-3.9 y. Persistent renal changes were more common in children > 4 y of age than in children < or = 1 y of age. Two months after the presenting infection, it was unusual to see a normal DMSA scan in a child with a VUR gr. > or = 3. The study suggests that DMSA changes after an index UTI may be transient for a longer period of time than has been previously considered. Therefore, in order to detect persistent changes, a DMSA scan should be performed more than 5 months after UTI."

G-CSF levels were significantly higher in patients in acute infectious status (571.9 +/- 782.9 pg/ml, mean +/- SD) than in normal volunteers (25.3 +/- 19.7 pg/ml). There was no significant relationship between serum G-CSF levels and age or granulocyte count in normal volunteers. In acute infectious status, there was no relationship between serum G-CSF levels and granulocyte count or c-reactive protein (CRP). We compared the response of G-CSF to infection between patients with frequently repeated infection (repeaters) and others (non-repeaters). Repeaters showed relative lower elevation of G-CSF levels in acute infectious status compared with non-repeaters (197.6 +/- 370.0 pg/ml vs. 1014.1 +/- 927.4 pg/ml p < 0.001).

UTI was diagnosed in the presence of symptoms of infection together with any colony growth for a single pathogen from urine obtained by suprapubic aspiration, or >or=10(4) CFU/ml for a single pathogen from urine obtained by urethral catheterization. Abnormal renal ultrasound was present in 37.1% of cases (34% in community-acquired UTI and 54.5% in nosocomial UTI, P < 0.01). The voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) showed vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in 27% of cases (23.8% in community-acquired UTI and 48.6% in nosocomial UTI, P < 0.01). In patients with abnormal renal ultrasound and VUR, renal scan with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) performed early after UTI revealed cortical defects in 69.5% of cases. However, in patients with abnormal renal ultrasound and normal VCUG, DMSA also revealed cortical defects in 39% of cases.

We reviewed the records of 185 children younger than 2 years of age admitted to hospital with febrile urinary tract infection. Patients were divided into having either acute pyelonephritis or acute cystitis according to the presence or absence of acute lesions on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy. Clinical and laboratory [white blood cell count (WBC), urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP)] findings were compared between the two groups using Student's t test, chi-square test, and multivariate analysis. Patients with pyelonephritis had statistically significant higher age, WBC, ESR, and CRP than those with cystitis. Although the sensitivity of the tests was 80-100%, their specificity was <28%. On multivariate analysis, 33% of patients with cystitis were diagnosed as having pyelonephritis, whereas 22% of those with pyelonephritis were considered to have cystitis. Given the low specificity of clinical findings and available laboratory tests to define the site of urine infection in this age group, we recommend DMSA renal scintigram as the test of choice to make the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in these patients."

Seventy-six patients (38 in each group) were studied. Thirty-seven percent were younger than 3 years of age. Escherichia coli was the most common isolate in both groups (85%). Eighty-five percent of all Gram-negative organisms were susceptible to TMP/SMX and all were susceptible to cefixime. Seventy-two percent of all patients were febrile at the time of diagnosis. Both groups were treated for 7 to 10 days. Peripheral white blood cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, body temperature and urinalysis returned to normal at the same rate in both groups. No failures were observed and relapse occurred in 3 cases within the 4 weeks after treatment (2 in the cefixime group and one in the TMP/SMX group). Side effects were observed in 14% of the cefixime group and 16% of the TMP/SMX group and were all mild enough not to necessitate discontinuation of therapy.

After 24 months patients were investigated by conventional VCUG or direct isotope cystogram. Survival analysis was performed in order to evaluate the resolution of the reflux. Differences between subgroups (mild vs moderate/severe reflux) were assessed by the two-sided log rank test. Thirty (58%) infants presented bilateral VUR, for a total of 83 renal units. There was a predominance of severe reflux (54%). Renal damage was detected in 33.7% of the units on first renal scan. There was a significant correlation between severe reflux and renal damage scars (RR=3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8, p=0.002). Forty-seven patients were treated with continuous prophylaxis. One patient developed systolic hypertension. Urinary tract infection occurred in 12 (25%) children conservatively managed. VUR resolution was evaluated in 56 renal units. Spontaneous resolution was observed in 25 units (45%). At 48 months after diagnosis, 75% of the cases of mild reflux (I-III) and 37% of severe reflux (IV-V) had resolved (log-rank, 5.6, p=0.017). There was an improvement of nutritional parameters between admission and the end of follow-up. In conclusion, the clinical course of prenatally detected VUR followed up on a medium-long-term basis is relatively benign. Our study corroborates the results obtained in other series of infants with reflux that emphasized the heterogeneity of this disorder."

CD009185,0,1335226,1,Diagnostic significance of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in urinary tract infection.,"A total of 106 children with symptomatic urinary tract infection (73 girls and 33 boys, 0-15.9 years of age) were studied by means of a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, renal ultrasound, and a desmopressin test during infection and at follow up approximately two months later. At follow up they were also investigated by means of intravenous urography (IVU) and micturition cystourethrography (MCU). During infection 23 children had a normal DMSA scan while 83 children had an abnormal one. The median C reactive protein and SD score for renal concentration capacity in the former group were 15 (range < 10-178) mg/l and -1.0 SD score (range -2.4 to 1.8), respectively, and in the latter group 98 (range < 10-320) mg/l and -3.1 SD score (range -5.7 to 1.1), respectively. In the former group there was no significant finding in any child on ultrasound or IVU and only one had significant vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (grade 3). At follow up 51 children had a normal DMSA scan while 55 children showed persistent changes. The median SD score for renal concentration capacity in the former group was -0.9 SD score (range -3.2 to 1.4) and in the latter group -1.6 SD score (range -4.6 to 2.5). No significant changes were found in the former group on ultrasound or IVU and only two children had significant VUR (grade 3). In the latter group 20 children showed changes on ultrasound, 15 showed changes on IVU, and 23 had VUR. These results suggest that a normal DMSA scan during or approximately two months after urinary tract infection in children indicates a low risk of finding significant pathology of the urinary tract."

Clinical and laboratory criteria classified the children as having pyelonephritis, cystitis, or no urinary tract infection. Of 28 children classified as having pyelonephritis, 24 (86%) children had abnormalities on 99mTcGH scintigraphy. Only 8 of 19 (42%) renal ultrasound scans and 4 of 17 (24%) intravenous pyelography studies performed in these children demonstrated findings consistent with parenchymal disease. Only 9 of 19 (47%) cystograms demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux. Three children who underwent gallium-67 citrate scintigraphy had localization at the sites of focal defects with 99mTcGH scintigraphy. 99mTcGH scintigraphy is a sensitive and specific indicator of renal parenchymal involvement that helps localize urinary tract infection to the kidney."

Positive images may be obtained within several hours of injection, but are more reliable at 24 hr. The results may be used to guide ultrasound or computed tomography studies, which give a detailed anatomic picture of the abscess. Gallium-67 imaging has also been used to detect abdominal neoplasms, but results are less impressive. Abdominal lymphoma is detected in just over 50% of sites. Gastrointestinal, renal, and gynecologic neoplasms are detected even less frequently. However, 67Ga is useful for detecting recurrence of 67Ga-avid neoplasms, and has been reliable in detecting hepatomas and nodal spread of seminoma. When used selectively in patients with neoplastic disease and suspected abscesses, 67Ga is an effective method for diagnosing abdominal disease."

During a 2 year followup of 71 lupus patients, 38 episodes of disease exacerbation and 36 episodes of infection could be analyzed. Plasma samples were obtained at least once a month. CRP levels were increased (greater than 6 mg/l) during 25 of the 38 exacerbations and during 32 of the 36 infections. Median CRP levels during infection (60 mg/l; range 1-400) were higher than during disease exacerbation (16.5 mg/l; range 1-375) (p less than 0.05). Levels of CRP rose prior to the exacerbation (p less than or equal to 0.01) and fell afterwards (p less than or equal to 0.01). During exacerbations accompanied by serositis, median levels of CRP (76 mg/l; range 2-375) were higher than during exacerbations without serositis (16 mg/l; range 1-53) (p less than 0.02). CRP levels exceeding 60 mg/l during exacerbations without serositis indicated infection in all cases. Thus, measurement of CRP in SLE is valuable to distinguish between infection and exacerbation only in the absence of serositis."

On examining the preoperative blood levels of protease inhibitors, Group A had an increased level of alpha 2MG and a decreased level of UTI compared to Groups B and C. alpha 1AT and CRP began to increase on the first day following hepatectomy and formed peaks on the third postoperative day. The increases were significantly higher in Group B than Group A (p less than 0.01). To investigate factors causative of these differences, alpha 1AT and CRP on the third postoperative day were compared in relation to the time of operation, amount of intraoperative bleeding, weight of the resected liver and preoperative ICGR15. alpha 1AT and CRP were significantly correlated to only preoperative ICGR15.

The quantification can be performed on the posterior view, with or without the lateral view for correction of kidney depth. The geometric mean can also be determined using both the anterior and the posterior views. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of remarkable differences in the results from quantification of the relative renal function using the geometric mean and those obtained using the posterior counts only. Moreover, we evaluated to what extent the patient age influenced these differences. We reviewed 328 99Tcm-DMSA scans. The difference between the relative renal function obtained using the posterior view and that obtained using the geometric mean was calculated and analysed statistically. For the purpose of evaluating the value of performing the geometric mean calculation in patients of different ages, patients were divided into four age groups (group I, < or =2 years; group II, 3-9 years; group III, 10-18 years; group IV, >18 years). Using the Student's t test, no statistical differences were found in the relative renal function obtained by the two methods (posterior projection and geometric mean) in groups I (t = 0.01, P = 0.992) and II (t = 1.43, P = 0.155), which consisted of patients younger than 10 years (77% of the patients). In groups III and IV statistical differences were found (t = 2.27, P = 0.028 and t = 2.170, P = 0.038), respectively. We conclude that for children under 10 years it is unnecessary to perform depth correction using the geometric mean except in rare cases of major malformations and position anomalies."

CD009185,0,9002094,0,Urinary tract infections in young febrile children.,"UTI is a common and important clinical problem in infants and young children, with a prevalence of 5.3% among febrile infants seen in our Emergency Department. White females with rectal temperature > or = 39 degrees C are at particularly high risk (prevalence, 17%). Several studies have highlighted the limitations of the standard urinalysis for identifying UTI in infants and young children and have recommended performance of both urinalysis and urine culture. Alternative methods such as dipstick urinalysis, although attractive because of ease of performance, are inadequate as a screen for UTI. Hemocytometer WBC counts of an uncentrifuged urine specimen can be performed in an office or hospital-based laboratory with minimal training. Performance of Gram-stained smears, however, is most appropriate for the hospital-based laboratory. In the hospital setting where both tests can readily be performed, the positive predictive value of the combination of pyuria and bacteriuria (85%) allows prompt institution of antimicrobial therapy before culture results are available, whereas the lower positive predictive value of the single finding of either pyuria or bacteriuria (40%) justifies delaying treatment decisions until culture results are available. In the office setting where hemocytometer counts can easily be performed, culturing only specimens with pyuria and those of children presumptively treated with antimicrobials will result in the identification of almost all patients with true UTI, sparing large health care expenditures. Although the urine culture is traditionally regarded as the gold standard of UTI, positive urine cultures may occur secondary to contamination or in cases of ABU, leading to a false diagnosis of UTI. In contrast we found pyuria to be a reliable marker to discriminate infection from colonization of the urinary tract. The sustained absence of an inflammatory response, on repeat UA within 24 h, constitutes strong evidence that infection is absent. Management of ABU is controversial; many experts recommend withholding antibiotics because eradication of low virulence organisms may be followed by colonization with more virulent species that cause pyelonephritis. Preliminary results of our ongoing treatment trial suggest that management of young febrile children with UTI as outpatients receiving oral cefixime is as efficacious as inpatient management with intravenous cefotaxime. Results of renal ultrasound and DMSA scan at the time of infection have not modified management in any patient. Accordingly selective rather than routine performance of ultrasound is recommended. A voiding cystourethrogram at 1 month and a DMSA scan 6 months later have been valuable in identifying patients with vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring, respectively. Among patients initially identified as having acute pyelonephritis, the incidence of renal scarring at 6 months has been substantially more frequent (approximately 40%) than we had expected. However, the long term implications of small scars identified with renal scintigraphy remain to be determined."
CD009185,0,19543152,0,Gender differences in inflammatory markers in children.,"No clear explanation exists to understand how sex hormones and/or chromosomes affect the immune system. In vitro studies of human lymphoid cells also show sex differences in immune function. To evaluate these differences in frequent pediatric emergencies, we analyze the expression of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and neutrophil count) underlying inflammatory processes in children: 482 children (241 girls and 241 boys) hospitalized for pneumonia (n = 384), pyelonephritis (n = 39), or bronchiolitis (n = 59) matched for age and sex. All patients were younger than 10 years. A control population of 97 children (50 girls and 47 boys) admitted for day surgery (tonsillectomy, circumcision, or strabismus) was included. We observed highly significant differences between girls and boys: median C-reactive protein concentration of 5.45 mg/dL (range, 0.2-36.0 mg/dL) for girls and 2.6 mg/dL (range, 0.3-37.3 mg/dL) for boys (P < 0.0001), and median erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 39.5 mm/h (range, 2-104 mm/h) for girls and 24 mm/h (range, 4-140 mm/h) for boys (P < 0.005). Neutrophil counts were also significantly different: a median of 8,796 cells/microL (range, 328-27,645 cells/microL) for girls and 6,774 cells/microL (range, 600-38,668 cells/microL) for boys (P < 0.02). The duration of fever after initiating antibiotic therapy was longer in girls than in boys, but there was no difference (Fisher exact test, P < 0.06). The present study documents a relationship between sex and both the production of inflammatory markers and neutrophil recruitment. Sex difference also showed more direct clinical relevance with associations seen between sex and both duration of fever and duration of disease (bronchiolitis P < 0.0007)."

Laboratory tests showed a slight elevation of all 'liver' enzymes. A differential diagnosis of cholecystitis or pyelonephritis was made. Additional tests did not confirm either of these diagnoses. Because of immobilisation pulmonary embolism was then suspected. This diagnosis was confirmed by scintigraphy. The patient was treated and made a full recovery.

CD009185,0,7143596,1,Urinary lactic dehydrogenase and serum C-reactive protein as means of localizing the site of urinary tract infection in patients with ileal conduits.,"Many patients with ileal conduit urinary diversion have infected urine but far fewer have clinical pyelonephritis. A noninvasive diagnostic test to distinguish renal bacteriuria from conduit colonization in these patients would seem desirable. Urine total lactic dehydrogenase and lactic dehydrogenase isoenzymes, and serum C-reactive protein have been useful to distinguish pyelonephritis from cystitis in patients with intact urinary tracts. We used these tests in patients with ileal conduits who had urine containing more and less than 10(5) organisms per ml. All patients had elevated urine total lactic dehydrogenase-5 isoenzyme, and serum C-reactive protein. No statistically significant difference in any of these parameters existed between the groups. These results may indicate that all patients with conduits have pyelonephritis but only intermittently demonstrate bacteriuria, or that the conduit mucosa contributes lactic dehydrogenase to the urine. However, it does not appear that these tests alone can distinguish accurately renal bacteriuria from conduit colonization."

A total of 78 children aged 1-121 months with a diagnosis of first-time febrile UTI were included. The following inflammatory markers were assessed: fever; white blood cells count (WBC); C-reactive protein (CRP); and serum and urine IL-6 and IL-8. The patients were divided into the acute pyelonephritis group (n=42) and the lower UTI group (n=36) according to the results of DMSA scan. Fever, WBC and CRP levels were significantly higher in children with acute pyelonephritis than in those with lower UTI (all p <0.001). Significantly, higher initial serum and urine IL-6 and IL-8 levels were found in children with acute pyelonephritis than in those with lower UTI (all p <0.001). Serum and urine IL-6 in children with acute pyelonephritis were positively correlated with fever, CRP and leucocyturia.

The patients were subdivided into pyelonephritis group (27 cases) and lower urinary tract infection (LUTI) group (21 cases) on the basis of fever, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reative protein and renal concentration capacity. At the acute stage of infection the lymphocyte responsiveness to leucoagglutinin (LA) and concanavalin A (Con A) was suppressed in both groups, but the suppression was much greater in those with pyelonephritis. By 6 weeks after infection the lymphocyte responses were normal in most but not all cases. We conclude that an acute pyelonephritis is associated with marked suppression of CMI and that the latter can be used as an additional criterion for establishing the level of infection. Patients with UTI did not generally appear to have any primary defect of CMI but when suppression of CMI was present, it seemed secondary to an ongoing infection."

CD009185,0,9378929,0,Renal and perirenal abscesses.,"Our knowledge of the spectrum of renal abscesses has evolved as a result of more sensitive radiologic techniques. The classification of intrarenal abscesses currently includes acute focal bacterial nephritis, acute multifocal bacterial nephritis, renal cortical abscess, renal corticomedullary abscess, and xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. The clinical presentation of these entities does not differentiate them, however, and various radiographic studies are helpful in making the diagnosis. The intrarenal abscess is usually treated successfully with antibiotic therapy alone. Antistaphylococcal therapy is indicated for the renal cortical abscess, whereas therapy directed against the common gram-negative uropathogens is indicated for most of the other entities. The perinephric abscess is often an elusive diagnosis, has a more serious prognosis, and is more difficult to treat. Drainage of the abscess and sometimes partial or complete nephrectomy, in addition to antibiotic therapy, are required for resolution."

CD009185,0,11687440,1,Cytokine profiles of pediatric patients treated with antibiotics for pyelonephritis: potential therapeutic impact.,"Urinary tract infections are common in infants and children. Pyelonephritis may result in serious complications, such as renal scarring, hypertension, and renal failure. Identification of the timing of release of inflammatory cytokines in relation to pyelonephritis and its treatment is essential for designing interventions that would minimize tissue damage. To this end, we measured urinary cytokine concentrations of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and IL-8 in infants and children with pyelonephritis and in healthy children. Children that presented to our institution with presumed urinary tract infection were given the diagnosis of pyelonephritis if they had a positive urine culture, pyuria, and one or more of the following indicators of systemic involvement: fever, elevated peripheral white blood cell count, or elevated C-reactive protein. Urine samples were obtained at the time of presentation prior to the administration of antibiotics, immediately after completion of the first dose of antibiotics, and at follow up 12 to 24 h after presentation. IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Creatinine concentrations were also determined, and cytokine/creatinine ratios were calculated to standardize samples. Differences between pre-antibiotic and follow-up cytokine/creatinine ratios were significant for IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 (P < 0.01). Differences between pre-antibiotic and control cytokine/creatinine ratios were also significant for IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 (P < 0.01). Our study revealed that the urinary tract cytokine response to infection is intense but dissipates shortly after the initiation of antibiotic treatment. This suggests that renal damage due to inflammation begins early in infection, underscoring the need for rapid diagnosis and intervention."

We studied 32 children with a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis established by high fever, flank pain/tenderness, increased blood levels of C-reactive protein and significant Escherichia coli growth in the urine culture. Renal tubular function tests and determinations of plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration were performed at diagnosis (study 1), after three days of iv gentamycin (study 2) and after 21 days of antibiotic therapy (study 3). Findings were compared to those present in 32 normal children of similar age. Despite normal plasma potassium concentration, fractional potassium excretion and transtubular potassium concentration gradient were significantly decreased in studies 1 and 2, becoming normal in study 3. Decreased renal potassium excretion coexisted with increased values for plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. In study 3 these hormones remained elevated only in patients with scarred kidneys. The functional alteration present in acute pyelonephritis may be directly caused by the interstitial inflammation or be mediated by some E. coli endotoxin."

Of 131 patients with recurrent urinary tract infection, all underwent DRNC and most also VCUG. Vesicoureteral reflux was found at DRNC in nine renal units (9 patients) in which VCUG was negative. In 17 renal units (15 patients) VCUG showed reflux to the ureter, but not to the renal pelvis, whereas DRNC revealed backflow from the bladder up to the renal pelvis. Reflux visualized at DRNC but not at VCUG was defined as grade Io. In all cases with reflux of grade I according to current classifications, DRNC showed reflux up to the renal pelvis. These observations make the distinction between grades I and II reflux in presently used classification less relevant and indicated the possible pathway of renal infection in patients with grade I vesicoureteral reflux and in so-called ""elusive"" reflux. We propose the addition of an extra grade (Io) of vesicoureteral reflux."
CD009185,0,3954416,0,C reactive protein in the evaluation of febrile illness.,"We studied prospectively 154 febrile children to determine the diagnostic value of the quantitative serum C reactive protein concentrations (CRP). Children with acute otitis media, acute tonsillitis, or treated with antibiotics during the two previous weeks and infants less than 2 months of age were excluded. Ninety seven children were from private paediatric practice and 57 were patients who had been admitted to hospital. The comparison group consisted of 75 children with confirmed bacterial infections whose CRP values were recorded retrospectively. In the study group 35 (23%) children had a confirmed viral infection, 92 (59%) had a probable viral infection as judged from the clinical picture and outcome of the illness, and 27 (18%) had a bacterial or probable bacterial infection. When the duration of the disease was more than 12 hours and the CRP value less than 20 mg/l, all children had a confirmed or probable viral infection. Nine children (one from the study group and eight from the comparison group) were found to have a septic infection and a CRP value of 20 mg/l or less. In all these cases, however, the duration of the symptoms was less than 12 hours. In addition CRP less than or equal to 20 mg/l was found in five (14%) children with urinary tract infection in the comparison group. CRP values of 20-40 mg/l were recorded in children with both viral and bacterial infections. A CRP value greater than or equal to 40 mg/l detected 79% of bacterial infections with 90% specificity. Our data show that determination of serum CRP concentrations is a valuable tool in evaluating children who have been ill for more than 12 hours."

CRP values are compared with clinical, radiologic and bacteriologic findings, showing in patients of the first two groups a normalization between fourth and ninth day of treatment, together with clinical and radiologic improvement. In contrast, it was shown that normalization of CRP in neonatal sepsis group was quite slow related to the torpid evolution. The sequentially measure of CRP was prove useful as antibiotic treatment control in children affected with different infectious pictures."

CD009185,0,2112833,0,Importance of prenatal detection of hydronephrosis of the upper pole.,"To determine the impact of prenatal detection on neonates with hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system, we reviewed 40 such cases seen between June 1982 and April 1989. This six-per-year rate contrasts with fewer than one case per year that was seen at our hospital from 1947 to 1977. Nineteen patients had an ectopic ureterocele, and 21 had an ectopic ureter without a ureterocele. Thirty-three (83%) were girls. Thirty-three cases were discovered because of abnormal findings on a prenatal sonogram, and 20 of those infants were asymptomatic. In the 33 patients whose prenatal sonographic findings were abnormal, the sonogram was diagnostically precise for hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system in only 39%. This imprecision did not adversely affect management or outcome. Postnatal sonography modified the prenatal diagnosis in 75% of these 33 patients. Voiding cystourethrography was the most sensitive and precise imaging technique for detecting both ureterocele and reflux. Lower pole reflux was almost twice as common when an ectopic ureterocele was present (63%) than when one was not (33%). Prenatal sonographic detection of hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system decreased the proportion of neonates presenting with urinary tract infection and urosepsis because of prophylactic antibiotics initiated at birth and continued until surgical correction. Precise prenatal diagnosis was not needed for effective surgical treatment."

To assess the effectiveness of CRP, PCT and ANP measurements in guiding emergency physicians' decisions whether to admit to hospital patients with acute pyelonephritis, we conducted a multicentre, prospective, observational study in 12 emergency departments in France; 582 consecutive patients were included. The reference standard for admission was defined by experts' advice combined with necessity of admission or death during the 28-day follow-up. Baseline CRP, PCT and ANP were measured and their accuracy in identifying the necessity of admission was analysed using area under curves (AUC) of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plots. According to the reference standard, 126 (22%) patients required admission. ANP (AUC 0.75, 95% CI 0.69-0.80) and PCT (AUC 0.75, 95% CI 0.71-0.80) more accurately predicted this than did CRP (AUC 0.69, 95% CI 0.64-0.74).

A diagnostical localisation is possible by the case history as well as clinical, sonographical and laboratory tests (leucocytes, CRP) to classify into a cystitis and infection of the parenchyma, respectively an uncomplicated or complicated UTI. Untreated complicated urinary tract infections have a bad prognosis. The therapy consists of bed rest, normalization of the urinary flow, a specific antibiotic therapy corresponding to the antibiotic sensitivity pattern and the administration of a prostaglandin-synthesis-inhibitor. Every physician should choose one of the many antibiotics and must get acquainted with the pharmacokinetics and side-effects. In severe acute infections, a calculated antibiotic therapy in certain combinations is necessary until the bacteriological findings are known. Corresponding to the spectrum of bacteria in complicated UTI, one should select a fluoro-chinolone, a broad-spectrum penicilline in combination with a beta-lactamase-inhibitor, a cephalosporine of the second and third generation with a relative stability against beta-lactamase as well as an aminoglycoside. Reserve-antibiotics for special indications are for example, cefsulodine. Less effective than the drugs mentioned above is cotrimoxazole, which was favourized before. In complicated UTI, the older gyrase-inhibitors like nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid, cinoxacin and nitrofurantoin are not longer indicated.

A-29-year-old male was referred to our hospital because of high fever, abnormal urinary findings (leukocytes 3+, protein 2+, occult blood 3+) and a moderate degree of azotemia(S-Cr 2.9 mg/dl). C-reactive protein (CRP) was 18.9 mg/dl and antibiotics were administered intravenously for 7 days under the diagnosis of pyelonephritis. High fever persisted, however, and S-Cr increased to 9.2 mg/dl even though a sufficient volume of urine was maintained. Blood and urine cultures were negative for bacteria. A kidney biopsy was performed and cellular crescents were observed around the glomeruli. No abnormal finding was observed in the lung and the nasopharyngeal region. To treat the crescentic glomerulonephritis, steroid and cyclophosphamide were administered while hemodialysis was carried out simultaneously. Although P-ANCA and C-ANCA were negative, anti-GBM antibody was proven to be positive thereafter (169 U) and six sessions of plasmapheresis were additionally performed to remove the antibody. Two months after the last plasmapheresis, the reduced urine volume (300 ml/day) gradually returned to normal. Hemodialysis was terminated because the S-Cr concentration reached a plateau at 4 mg/dl. Repeated biopsy revealed marked glomerulosclerosis, hence hypertension treatment and a low protein diet were ordered. In conclusion, residual renal function might improve even after 4 months of hemodialysis in cases of intensively treated anti-GBM-positive crescentic glomerulonephritis, though consecutive renoprotective therapy is required."

At the time of admission, her renal function had severely deteriorated (sCr 8.2 mg/dl, 24 h Ccr 6 ml/min), she had a severe high fever (BT 39.5 degrees C), back pain, a white blood cell count of 19,540/,microl, and a CRP level of 26.7 mg/dl. Blood and urine cultures yielded identical strains of E. coli. We diagnosed sepsis caused by pyelonephritis, and started intravenous meropenem trihydrate(MEPM) at 0.5 g/day. Her renal dysfunction was severe, so we started hemodialysis therapy. Immunological examination revealed the presence of ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis. Renal biopsy before steroid therapy confirmed the diagnosis of pauci-immune-type crescentic glomerulonephritis. Based on purpura and interstitial pneumonia, along with rapidly MPO-ANCA-positive progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with acute renal failure, we diagnosed microscopic polyangitis (MPA). To treat sepsis and severe pyelonephritis, we started intravenous immunoglobulin 5 g (100 mg/kg)/day for 5 days before starting immunosuppressive steroid therapy (m-PSL 1 g/day, PSL 20 mg/day) for 3 days. These treatments improved her general condition and immediately improved her renal function. It is important to prevent infection during treatment using conventional immunosuppressive therapy.

Forty-eight children with unilateral primary VUR diagnosed after the first pyelonephritis were enrolled. Mean age of patients was 1.0+/-1.6 years (29 boys and 19 girls). All patients underwent renal ultrasonography and renal 99 m-technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan within three days following the diagnosis of pyelonephritis, and voiding cystourethrography (VCU) was performed soon after fever subsided and the infection was controlled. The DMSA scan was rechecked six months after the initial study when the first scan showed a renal defect. The first DMSA showed renal defects in 34 (70.8%) out of 48 of the refluxing renal units and in 13 (27.1%) out of 48 of the nonrefluxing renal units (P<0.01, OR: 6.54). At six months after the infection, 23 (47.9%) out of 48 refluxing renal units and seven (14.6%) out of 48 nonrefluxing renal units had renal scars on DMSA scan (P<0.01, OR: 5.39). The prevalence of renal scars did not vary significantly according to the grade of VUR. The CRP level on admission was significantly higher in patients with acute renal defect and scar. In conclusion, VUR increases the risk of post-pyelonephritic renal scars in children."

We believe that early dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan after febrile urinary tract infection predicts clinically significant reflux and which children should undergo voiding cystourethrogram. The criticism of this approach is that some reflux and preventable renal damage would be missed. This study validates the use of initial dimercapto-succinic scan and presents 5-year renal outcomes."

Arteriography is no longer necessary for the diagnosis of a pseudotumor, which has a specific isotope and a helpful sonographic appearance. The diagnosis of a renal abscess opposed to pyelonephritis can be made in a more definite fashion than is possible with other imaging techniques. We believe that the sonogram and isotope studies are particularly helpful in trauma because there is a more realistic assessment of the absence of renal function with isotopes than with the excretory urogram. One may detect hematoma within and around the kidney by ultrasonography."

Diagnostic findings on planar and tomoscintigraphic acquisitions obtained 3 and 4 h after the injection of 130-140 MBq 99Tcm-DMSA were compared with the diagnosis established by fine-needle biopsy in 13 patients and by clinical course and other examinations (ultrasonography, bacteriology) in 11 patients. Renal scintigraphy demonstrated segmental defects in patients with rejection (n = 2/6), immunosuppressor nephrotoxicity (n = 2/6), acute pyelonephritis (n = 3/3), renal artery stenosis (n = 1/1) and obstructive lymphocele (n = 1/1). Diffuse lack of uptake was observed in one patient with severe renal failure. The scintigram was normal in 14 patients, including three with lesions histologically compatible with graft rejection or immunosuppressor nephrotoxicity. 99Tcm-DMSA was thus found to contribute little to the differential diagnosis between graft rejection and immunosuppressor nephrotoxicity. However, it may be useful for identifying specific disease states, particularly acute pyelonephritis, seen as well-delimited systematized defects. 99Tcm-DMSA scintigraphy could also be used in late follow-up after pyelonephritis in renal transplant recipients."

CD009185,0,2506729,0,Evaluation of renal function and morphology in children by 99mTc-DTPA gamma camera renography.,"The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the use of 99mTc-DTPA (diethylenetriaminepenta-acetate) gamma camera renography for the study of kidney function as well as morphology. Sixty-nine children with urinary tract infection or congenital hydronephrosis aged 6 days to 13.6 years were studied. A method for determination of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from the recorded curves without use of blood or urine samples was tested in 65 consecutive children. From each renogram an uptake index was determined. After a weight/height correction the sum of right and left kidney uptake index correlated with total GFR determined from plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA (ethylenediaminetetra-acetate) measured on the same day (r = 0.96). The relative standard error of estimating GFR from the renograms was 10.7% at GFR = 100 ml/min and 14.6% at GFR = 50 ml/min. In a subgroup including 20 children no difference was found in kidney morphology and length studied by renography and intravenous urography, the latter providing more details concerning the urinary tract. Relative kidney length did not correlate with relative renal function determined by renography, emphasizing the difficulty in determination of relative renal function by urography. In conclusion, not only relative but also absolute renal function (GFR) can be determined in children by 99mTc-DTPA renography; at the same time kidney and urinary tract morphology are evaluated. In our hands, 99mTc-DTPA renography has become a useful diagnostic tool, lowering the need for the more cumbersome intravenous urography and 51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance. However, intravenous urography is mandatory for the detailed study of the urinary tract, and use of the 51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance technique is necessary when a very reliable determination of GFR is wanted."

Ultrasonography, contrast micturating cystourethrography (MCU), intravenous urography (IVU), and technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) studies were performed in 58 children with UTI under 14 years of age attending two teaching hospitals and the results compared. All four investigations were normal in 12 children. In 36 with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) on MCU, dilatation was reported on ultrasonography in eight children. Radiological renal scarring was seen in 20 children; it was suspected on ultrasonography in nine, with dilatation alone in four, and a normal report in seven. Duplex kidneys identified on IVU were unrecognised on ultrasonography or DMSA studies; ultrasonography showed no change corresponding to presumed acute defects on DMSA studies that later resolved. Disparities were observed at all ages. This study suggests that ultrasonography is unreliable in detecting VUR, renal scarring, or inflammatory change and, alone, is inadequate for investigating UTI in children."

Ultrasonography may not detect either vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) or renal scars or inflammation. The reduced nephrogram or renal swelling following a first attack of acute pyelonephritis may not be recognised without renal measurement on an intravenous urogram. Renal scarring may be diagnosed incorrectly on the basis of functional defects of isotope uptake on a technetium 99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid study.

Levels above 200 pg/ml were always found in infected patients, giving a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 74%. C-reactive protein correlated weakly with interleukin-6 levels, indicating a defective acute-phase response in cirrhosis. Tumor necrosis factor alpha plasma levels were less sensitive (95%) and specific (68%) for the diagnosis of bacterial infection at a threshold of 50 pg/ml, but were more closely related to a poor patient outcome.

Furthermore, VUR in childhood is the main reason for pyelonephritis, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Recently, a variety of procedures with low radiation have been recommended for diagnosis of VUR. Therefore, in this study, voiding urosonography (VUS) or cystosonography was performed for evaluation of VUR and for comparing it with radio nucleotide cystography (RNC). We studied 25 children admitted with initial diagnosis of VUR in our center in the year 2007. Simultaneously, RNC and VUS were performed for all the patients. VUR was detected in eight patients with the VUS procedure and in nine children with RNC. Another patient was diagnosed only by RNC, and two other patients by only VUS. The two methods were concordant in detection and exclusion of urinary reflux in 87% (P: 0.000, r: 0.728). Furthermore, the diagnosis of various grades of reflux by these two schemes were comparable (P: 0.0000, r: 0.724). Sensitivity and specifity of VUS was determined as 87% and 88%, respectively, with a 94% positive predictive value and a 77% negative predictive value.

The patients ranged in age from 1 to 78 years and their pathologies included urinary tract infection (n = 50), space occupying lesions (n = 5), calculi (n = 4), hypertension (n = 4) and others (n = 5). Planar scans were performed 3 h after the injection of 80 MBq of 99Tcm-DMSA and a 64 x 20 s acquisition over 360 degrees was used for SPET. High-resolution collimation was used for both. Slices were displayed as transaxial, coronal and sagittal and/or oblique sagittal in the plane of the kidney. Three-dimensional (3D) images were formed by volume rendering. Each kidney was divided into three regions and each region scored separately for the presence of an abnormality. Planar scans were reviewed alone and then in conjunction with SPET and 3D images. Planar imaging detected 95 abnormal regions compared with 103 using SPET. SPET reduced the number of equivocal regions in 8 (12%) patients.

Twenty-seven (21.8%) patients had primary and 97 (78.2%) had secondary IPA. The main sources of infection were bone (50.5%), gastrointestinal tract (24.7%), and urinary tract (17.5%). A definitive microbial diagnosis was achieved in 93 (75%) cases. Abscess culture was the most frequent procedure leading to microbial diagnosis, followed by blood cultures. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides species were the most frequent microbial causes: S. aureus was the most common organism in patients with primary abscesses (42.9%) and with abscesses of skeletal origin (35.2%), whereas E. coli was the leading organism in those with abscesses of urinary (61.5%) and gastrointestinal (42.1%) tracts. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in 15 patients, 4 of them associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Twenty (21.5%) cases had polymicrobial infections; these were more common among patients with abscesses of gastrointestinal origin. Information on clinical outcome was available for 120 patients; 19 (15.8%) had a relapse and 6 (5%) died due to complications related to the IPA. Patients who died were older and more likely to have bacteremia and E. coli isolated from cultures. In conclusion, secondary IPA is more prevalent than primary IPA. Among those with secondary IPA, most abscesses are secondary to a skeletal source. A bacterial etiology can be identified in most cases.

Consequently, DMSA scintigraphy provides a unique opportunity to study the progression of renal damage and functional loss from the initial insult of acute pyelonephritis to the subsequent development of irreversible renal scarring. Over the last few years, clinical and experimental investigations using DMSA renal scintigraphy have provided new insights into the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical outcome of acute pyelonephritis in children. These studies have confirmed the primary role of the acute inflammatory response, associated with both reflux and nonreflux pyelonephritis, in the etiology of irreversible renal scarring. Furthermore, several studies have shown that renal scarring can be prevented or diminished by the early diagnosis and treatment of pyelonephritis. This review highlights these recent observations and makes recommendations regarding current clinical and future research applications."

Additional dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy in this setting is a common but not routine practice to determine whether there is parenchymal injury. Because dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy involves further time, expense and radiation, we determined whether ultrasound findings could substitute for dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy. Therefore, in children with urinary tract infections we researched the incidence of discordant findings between dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy and normal ultrasound."

CD009185,0,20839025,0,Selection of first-line i.v. antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in patients requiring emergency hospital admission.,"Febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) often require the intravenous infusion of antibiotics and/or hospitalization. Acute pyelonephritis (AP) is one of the most severe forms of UTI, and the antibiotics we should use as the first line and the risk factors for treatment failure remain controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of i.v. antibiotics selected for the treatment of febrile AP and to examine the risk factors for antibiotic resistance. We set risk factors for antibiotic treatment failure such as age, sex, and the presence of underlying urinary tract disease. We classified all cases into 49 cases of complicated AP and 24 cases of uncomplicated AP according to the presence of underlying urinary tract diseases, and examined the characteristics of the patients and the efficacy of the antibiotics used in this study. We investigated risk factors which relate to initial treatment failure and the duration of antibiotic treatment. Initial antibiotic treatment failure was significantly correlated to C-reactive protein in complicated AP and to positive blood culture in uncomplicated AP. We revealed a significant correlation between the duration of the given antibiotics and diabetes mellitus or positive blood culture in uncomplicated AP, and tazobactam/piperacillin was significantly related to prolongation of antibiotic treatment in complicated AP. In conclusion, in this study, a positive blood culture was the representative risk factor that related to both initial treatment failure and longer duration of the given antibiotics in uncomplicated AP."

All patients aged 6 weeks to 15 years suspected of acute pyelonephritis (APN) were admitted to the Paediatric Department and underwent Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy within 3 days after admission and at 6 months. Of 166 patients enrolled in the study, 15 (9%) had negative or equivocal urine culture despite clinical and scintigraphic evidence of APN. Of these 15 children, renal ultrasound was normal in 7 patients and vesicoureteric reflux was found in 9 patients. Control DMSA 6 months after acute episode showed the disappearance of cortical lesions in eight and partial improvement in four patients. In this prospective series, as many as 9% of patients with APN would have been missed on the basis of equivocal or negative urine cultures. It is suggested that Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy should be performed in children with severe infection without clear aetiology, especially in those with abnormal urinalysis."

CD009185,0,9378930,0,Advances in the imaging of renal infection. Helical CT and modern coordinated imaging.,"Traditionally, imaging of renal infections was largely through a multimodality approach. Excretory urography, ultrasonography, nuclear scintigraphy, and CT all played major roles; however, in recent years, CT has increased in prominence in the imaging and evaluation of renal infection. Part of the reason for this trend includes improvements in the availability of CT scanners and more timely access to them. Helical scanning technology has also greatly increased the quality and usefulness of the information CT provides. Most uncomplicated cases of acute renal infection in adults do not require imaging for diagnosis and treatment. When imaging is indicated, however, contrast-enhanced CT almost always is the study of choice. For cases in which renal calculi may be present, the study should also include noncontrast images through the kidneys."

CD009185,0,16356794,0,Pediatric applications of renal nuclear medicine.,"This review should be regarded as an opinion based on personal experience, clinical and experimental studies, and many discussions with colleagues. It covers the main radionuclide procedures for nephro-urological diseases in children. Glomerular filtration rate can be accurately determined using simplified 2- or 1-blood sample plasma clearance methods. Minor controversies related to the technical aspects of these methods concern principally some correction factors, the quality control, and the normal values in children. However, the main problem is the reluctance of the clinician to apply these methods, despite the accuracy and precision that are higher than with the traditional chemical methods. Interesting indications are early detection of renal impairment, hyperfiltration status, and monitoring of nephrotoxic drugs. Cortical scintigraphy is accepted as a highly sensitive technique for the detection of regional lesions. It accurately reflects the histological changes, and the interobserver reproducibility in reporting is high. Potential technical pitfalls should be recognized, such as the normal variants and the difficulty in differentiating acute lesions from permanent ones or acquired lesions from congenital ones. Although dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy seems to play a minor role in the traditional approach to urinary tract infection, recent studies suggest that this examination might influence the treatment of the acute phase, the indication for chemoprophylaxis and micturating cystography, and the duration of follow-up. New technical developments have been applied recently to the renogram: tracers more appropriate to the young child, early injection of furosemide, late postmicturition and gravity-assisted images and, finally, more objective parameters of renal drainage. Pitfalls mainly are related to the interpretation of drainage on images and curves. Dilated uropathies represent the main indication of the renogram, but the impact of this technique on the management of the child is, in a great number of cases, still a matter of intense controversy. Direct and indirect radionuclide cystography are interesting alternatives to the radiograph technique and should be integrated into the process of diagnosis and follow-up of vesicoureteral reflux."
CD009185,0,7692210,1,Lack of association between hemolysin production and acute inflammation in human urinary tract infection.,"Hemolysins are cytolytic proteins which have been extensively characterized at the molecular level, however, their in vivo functions remain unclear. This study analyzed the association of hemolysin production with the inflammatory response in patients with urinary tract infection (UTI). Infants and children with their first episode of UTI (n = 644) were followed prospectively. The body temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urinary leucocyte count and renal concentrating capacity were used as measures of the inflammatory response. The hemolytic genotype (hly) of the Escherichia coli strain from each UTI episode was defined by DNA-DNA hybridization, and the phenotype by hemolysis in blood agar. There was no significant increase in the level of fever, CRP, ESR, or decrease in renal concentrating capacity during UTI episodes caused by hly positive compared to hly negative E. coli. Multiple regression analysis did not demonstrate significant associations of hly with elevated fever, CRP, ESR or reduced renal concentrating capacity. In contrast, patients infected with P fimbriated E. coli strains had higher fever, CRP, ESR and lower renal concentrating capacity than those infected with other strains. This association was not influenced by the hly genotype of the P fimbriated strains. The frequency of hly+ strains was not significantly higher in the subset of patients assigned a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis compared to asymptomatic bacteriuria. This was in contrast to P fimbriae, which were accumulated in acute pyelonephritis. The results suggested that the acute inflammatory response to E. coli UTI is independent of hemolysin production. The inflammatogenic potential of uropathogenic E. coli clones was better described by the presence or absence of P-fimbriae than by hemolysin."

One of typical acute phase proteins is C-reactive protein (CRP), often served as an additional inflammation maker. The aim of the study was to compare serum IL-6 and CRP concentrations assessment in diagnosis and monitoring of IE. The study group consisted of 40 patients with ongoing IE and valvular heart diseases. Two control groups consisted of patients with valvular heart diseases: 15 without infection and another 15 with urinary tract infection. The diagnosis of IE was established according to the Duke University criteria; in 34 patients positive blood cultures were found. Serum IL-6 and CRP were measured on three occasions after diagnosis of IE was established and during antimicrobial treatment (mean period 14 +/- 7 days) by ELISA. Usefulness of both parameters for IE diagnosis were described. Reference values were defined as 0-12.5 pg/ml for IL-6, and 0-10 mg/l for CRP. Mean concentrations of IL-6 and CRP in patients with IE (37 +/- 44.3 pg/ml and 27.1 +/- 23.9 mg/l) were significantly higher than in controls: with urinary tract infection (9.1 +/- 4.42 pg/ml and 6.95 +/- 4.39 mg/l) and without infection (3.95 +/- 1.4 pg/ml and 2.21 +/- 0.96 mg/l). CRP concentration was not significantly correlated with IL-6 (r = 0.51, p = 0.07). The significant tendency of consecutive IL-6 concentrations to decrease (from 37 +/- 44.3 to 8.7 +/- 5.7 pg/ml), without decrease of CRP (from 27.1 +/- 23.9 mg/l to 22 +/- 18.3 mg/l) was found."

CD009185,0,11473562,0,Fatal form of phaeochromocytoma presenting as acute pyelonephritis.,"We report the case of a young man who presented with a clinical picture of acute pyelonephritis. Within 3 h of admission, the patient developed acute respiratory distress associated with tachycardia and shock, and he was transferred to the intensive care unit. Mechanical ventilation of the lungs and symptomatic treatment were started immediately. Abdominal ultrasound revealed the presence of an adrenal tumour with central necrosis indicating a probable phaeochromocytoma. There was no sign of pyelonephritis. Ventricular fibrillation followed by asystole occurred soon after admission. The suddenness of the patient's death did not allow time for further investigation and therapy. The severity of the clinical signs was probably related to a massive release of catecholamines because of necrosis of the tumour, which may have been worsened by the diagnostic procedures performed to investigate the clinical symptoms and signs of acute pyelonephritis."
CD009185,0,8378794,0,Scintigraphic evaluation of pediatric urinary tract infection.,"Scintigraphic evaluation of urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, and renal scarring represents a significant portion of a clinical pediatric nuclear medicine practice. Renal scarring from recurring infection remains an important cause of end-stage renal disease and hypertension in the pediatric population. However, the clinical presentation in infants and young children is often elusive, and clinical diagnosis of upper tract involvement is frequently unreliable. As a result, diagnostic imaging has a critical role to play in the localization of infection to the lower or upper urinary tract. Radionuclide cystography and renal cortical imaging have become mainstays of this evaluation. Direct radionuclide cystography is the preferred cystographic screening technique, because it has lower radiation exposure and greater sensitivity for the detection of vesicoureteral reflux than either indirect radionuclide cystography or fluoroscopic contrast cystography. Renal cortical scintigraphy has become the standard for the detection of pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Correlation with histopathology has demonstrated a high degree of diagnostic accuracy. Acute pyelonephritis has been shown to be the necessary etiologic factor for the development of subsequent renal scarring, and the mechanism of renal injury in pyelonephritis has been extensively studied in experimental models. The ability of prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy to dramatically reduce the incidence of subsequent scarring also has been conclusively demonstrated both clinically and in the experimental model. Vesicoureteral reflux was once thought to be a necessary prerequisite for the development of renal scarring. Although it is clear that the intrarenal reflux of infected urine will create pyelonephritis in the experimental model, the high incidence of pyelonephritis and subsequent scarring in the absence of demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux leaves the role of reflux in question. Although the role of vesicoureteral reflux is incompletely understood, its detection nevertheless remains a standard part of the patient's evaluation."

Recurrent tumor identified in the neck was treated with 125 mCi I-131. Post-therapy scan revealed a large focus of I-131 uptake in the pelvis, not seen on the pretherapy I-123 scan. Postvoid imaging was unchanged, and there were no symptoms of urinary tract infection. No renal or ureteral activity was present to suggest delayed excretion or obstruction. Further history revealed the patient had not yet reached menarche. For concerns of an imperforate hymen possibly trapping radioactive blood, a pelvic ultrasound was performed and was compatible with hematocolpos. After the discovery of a transverse vaginal septum, a large amount of clotted blood was evacuated following incision. Hematocolpos as a cause of I-131 pelvic uptake and a potential false positive scan for metastatic thyroid cancer is probably rare. Findings concerning a genital tract outflow obstruction in a young female are generally treated without delay to prevent future reproductive problems.

Asymptomatic infants were screened at 2 weeks and at 3 and 10 months of age, and bacteriuria was confirmed by bladder puncture. Infants with febrile urinary tract infection were enrolled during the same study period. The inflammatory response was characterized by the presence of fever, serum C-reactive protein, microsedimentation rate, urinary leukocyte excretion, and width of the ureters. The bacteria were defined for O:K:H serotype, hemolysin production, resistance to the bactericidal effect of serum, attachment to uroepithelial cells, and specificity for the globoseries of glycolipid receptors. In agreement with previous studies, the frequency of increased inflammatory signs and of attaching Escherichia coli was significantly higher in infants with febrile urinary tract infection than in the screening group. Within both patient groups, however, children infected with attaching E. coli strains had significantly more inflammatory signs. The results suggest that adherence facilitates the presentation of bacterial components capable of causing inflammation in the tissues in the urinary tract."

All the patients were assessed throught a predominantly non invasive diagnostic approach which included: pediatric urologic examination with aimed anamnestic and clinical freaming, functional examination of the lower urinary tract using uroflowmetry + EMG of the perineal plane muscles (UR + EMG), kidney and bladder ultrasound. This methodology has permitted a widening of the indications in the study of vesical function as well as limiting the selected cases (hight UTI, uncertain diagnosis) of mini-invasive examination, such as flow pressure study, minctional cystourethrogram (MC) and or renal scintigraphy. An MNR of the lumbo-sacral medulla (cord) and a neurological and/or neurosurgery evaluation were only carried out were there was a suspected occult neurological pathology. The clinical sintomatogy was as follows: approximately 70% of the patients suffered from partial diurnal incontinence, 42% were affected by secondary nocturnal enuresis while 58.6% suffered from recurrent UTI. In those patients with UTI, 11% (16 patients, 24 ureteral units) suffered from associated VUR while 3.5% suffered from either congenital or acquired urethral stenosis. From the urodynamic examination, we determined the presence of detrusorial instability in 158 patients (64%) and lazy bladder or vescical hypotonia in 84 patients (34%). The suggested therapy foresees the use of: hospital home-based uroriabilitation (minctional biofeedback), endoscopic therapy (sub-ureteral bulking, urethral dilatation) and corrective VUR surgery (only in those cases that did not respond to medical treatment). The percentage of total recovery in patients with detrusorial instability was 80%, the minctional biofeedback both associated and unassociated with drug therapy lead to complete recovery in 66% of patients with lazy and uncordinated bladder, wile 26% showed improvement and 7 patients (8.4%) did not respond.

Almost one half of the cases were less than 5 years old (47.2%) and about 1/4 were less than 1 year old (24.7%). In girls, the incident which reveals the diagnosis is most often an infection and in boys, it is pain or haematuria. 26% of the cases had an associated urological lesion (23 cases of vesico-ureteric reflux, 8 cases of renal stones, 5 cases of mega-ureter and 4 cases of horseshoe kidney). 133 children were operated, essentially by resection of the pyelo-ureteric junction with an upstream by-pass. From the 126 cases with sufficient follow-up, 48 (38.1%) obtained great improvement, 63 (50%) a moderate improvement and 15 (11.9%), a stabilisation of the dilatation. In all cases except 3, the pyelo-ureteric junction was perfectly catheterizable. The histological lesions of the junction were variable and difficult to systematise, but usually extended beyond the junction to involve a large part of the pelvis. The variability of the caliceal dilatation makes any attempt at classification difficult. The authors recommend cystography in every case, as associated reflux was discovered in 16% of cases. Retrograde uretero-pyelography is practically no longer indicated. The isotope kidney scan with DTPA technetium, with a hyper-diuresis test, is often used, as it gives an idea about the clearance of filtration and about the degree of obstruction. Quantitative DMSA kidney scan can reveal the effects on the renal parenchyma. Conservation of the isthmus of a horseshoe kidney never interferes with the uretero-pyelic re-implantation. After correction of the anomaly of the uretero-pyelic junction, 5 cases of unilateral reflux out of 8 and 3 cases of bilateral reflux out of 10 resolved spontaneously."

CD009185,0,7618902,0,Long-term follow up to determine the prognostic value of imaging after urinary tract infections. Part 1: Reflux.,"In 3646 children with at least one confirmed urinary tract infection the prevalence of vesicoureteric reflux at presentation was correlated with progressive renal damage during follow up of not less than two and up to 16 years. Reflux was not demonstrated either at presentation or at any subsequent time in almost one half of the children who suffered progressive renal damage and was not a risk factor for progressive renal damage in boys under 1 year. It was an important risk factor in boys over 1 year and in girls of any age. The risk of progressive renal damage in children in whom micturating cystourethrography (MCU) did not reveal vesicoureteric reflux was substantially greater than in those who indirect isotope voiding study (IVS) did not show reflux. The risk of deterioration for those in whom reflux was demonstrated was similar for both techniques. This discrepancy indicates an appreciably higher false negative rate for the MCU than the IVS. Dilatation of the renal pelvis detected by ultrasound was associated with a significantly increased risk of progressive damage only when associated with reflux, but most children with progressive damage did not have a dilated collecting system at presentation."
CD009185,0,7618903,0,Long-term follow up to determine the prognostic value of imaging after urinary tract infections. Part 2: Scarring.,"Long term follow up of children with urinary tract infections, in whom imaging investigations were performed at presentation, has been used to identify features that distinguish those at greatest risk of progressive renal damage. No single investigation at presentation was able to predict subsequent deterioration but, by employing a combination of imaging investigations, it was possible to separate groups with high or low probability of progressive damage. In the low risk group the incidence of progressive damage was 0.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0 to 1.3%). The combination of both scarring and reflux at presentation, or one only of these but accompanied by subsequent documented urinary tract infection, was associated with a 17-fold (95% CI 2.5 to 118) increase in the relative risk of progressive renal damage compared with children without these features. The recommended combination of investigations at presentation for girls of any age and boys over 1 year is ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in all, to detect both scarring and significant structural abnormalities, renography in children with dilatation of any part of the urinary tract on ultrasound, to distinguish dilatation from obstruction, and an isotope voiding study in all who have acquired bladder control. This gives the best separation between those at high and those at low risk of progressive damage with least radiation dose and lowest rate of instrumentation. Micturating cystourethrography (MCU) should be restricted to girls who have not acquired bladder control, unless there is reason to suspect a significant structural abnormality such as urethral valves. A single non-febrile urinary tract infection that responds promptly to treatment is not a justification for performing MCU in boys under 1 year or in children of any age with bladder control. No case can be made for any abbreviated schedule of investigation. These risk factors should be taken into account when designing follow up protocols."

Based on these data, the suggestion has been made that elevated serum CRP concentrations may be useful in identifying patients with upper urinary tract infections. In a study in which the bladder washout test was used to localize the site of urinary tract infections, we identified nine girls with renal bacteriuria who did not have clinical findings suggesting acute pyelonephritis; four of these girls had serum CRP concentrations less than 10 micrograms/ml. Twenty-eight girls had bladder washout-proven lower urinary tract infections; three of these had serum CRP values greater than 30 micrograms/ml. These studies show that an elevated serum CRP concentration is not accurate in localizing the site of a urinary tract infection in girls who do not have clinical signs of acute pyelonephritis."

CD009185,0,8840549,0,A case of ureteral reflux identified by ultrasound.,"Reflux nephropathy is known to be a major cause of renal failure in children. Vesico-ureteral reflux is usually diagnosed by voiding cysto-urethrography (VCG). However, it has been observed that conventional VCG is not always reliable for the diagnosis of ureteral reflux. In the case of a 5 year old girl with recurrent febrile urinary tract infection, VCG showed no ureteral reflux. Urodynamic study revealed a large bladder capacity and significant residual urine. Renal scintigram delineated a right renal scar. Simple ultrasound examination with videotape recording during voiding definitely demonstrated the presence of significant ureteral reflux when she voided, that is, there was marked dilatation of the right distal ureter and ballooning of the right renal pelvis on voiding, and quick refilling of the bladder concomitantly with the disappearance of the pelvic ballooning. Therefore, an ultrasound during voiding may be useful for diagnosing ureteral reflux in patients where a VCG does not reveal reflux."

Without doubt, the chronic pyelonephritis is the most frequent renal disease which is confirmed by new statistics of morbidity. The diagnostics still renders difficulties. In a course poor in symptoms it is not thought of the existence of the disease. For the rational dignostics in practice a step plan is recommended. In every case diagnostics should precede therapy.

CD009185,0,21868595,0,Economic and radiation costs of initial imaging approaches after a child's first febrile urinary tract infection.,"BACKGROUND. The traditional initial imaging approach following pediatric urinary tract infection is the ""bottom-up"" approach (cystogram and renal ultrasound). Recently, the ""top-down"" approach (nuclear renal scan followed by cystogram for abnormal scans only) has gained increasing attention. The relative cost and radiation doses of these are unknown METHODS. The authors used a decision model to evaluate these imaging approaches. Cost and effective radiation dose estimates, including sensitivity analyses, were based on one-time imaging only. RESULTS. Comparing hypothetical cohorts of 100 000 children, the top-down imaging approach cost $82.9 million versus $59.2 million for the bottom-up approach. Per-capita effective radiation dose was 0.72 mSv for top-down compared with 0.06 mSv for bottom-up. CONCLUSIONS. Routine use of nuclear renal scans in children following initial urinary tract infection diagnosis would result in increased imaging costs and radiation doses as compared to initial cystogram and ultrasound. Further data are required to clarify the long-term clinical implications of this increase."

CD009185,0,9326956,0,"Urinary tract infections in children. Epidemiology, evaluation, and management.","Accurate documentation of UTIs in children is essential for proper evaluation and management. Urine cultures with multiple organisms or colony counts less than 50,000 to 100,000 CFU/ml should be considered suspect and require confirmation, particularly with clean-catch specimens. Children with well-documented UTIs should be evaluated based on their age and presenting symptoms. Infants and young children require imaging, usually with a cystogram and sonogram of the kidneys and bladder. Older girls with febrile UTIs and boys at any age should also be considered for urinary tract imaging. Renal cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA has emerged as the imaging study of choice for acute pyelonephritis and renal scarring in children with UTIs. Treatment of UTIs in children ideally commences with culture-specific antimicrobial therapy, although treatment may be started in sick children before culture results are available. Short-course treatment (3-5 days) is sufficient for children with acute uncomplicated lower UTIs. Children with acute pyelonephritis require 10 to 14 days of antibiotics, which can be administered on an outpatient basis in older infants and children who are not toxic, as long as good compliance is expected. Patients with first-time UTIs who require imaging should be maintained on low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis until their workup is completed. Treatment of ABU does not seem necessary if the urinary tract is otherwise normal. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for children with frequent symptomatic recurrences of UTI and for those with known VUR. Diagnosis and treatment of underlying voiding dysfunction and constipation is an essential component of the successful management of UTIs in children."
CD009185,0,11793131,1,Age-related radiological imaging in children with acute pyelonephritis.,"Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) using clinical and laboratory parameters is often difficult in children. The aims of this retrospective study were twofold. Firstly, to correlate the clinical and laboratory manifestations of APN with the results of the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in different age groups. Secondly, to compare the DMSA renal scan, renal ultrasonography (RUS), and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in patients with clinical APN. The DMSA renal scan was utilized as the gold standard for renal involvement. We determined the sensitivity of these tests in febrile urinary tract infections (UTI) in three age groups: group I less than 2 years; group II 2-8 years; group III older than 8 years. During the period January 1992 through December 1998, 222 children presented with a febrile UTI. All patients had a DMSA renal scan, 208 had contrast VCUG, and 163 had RUS. The clinical and laboratory manifestation of pyelonephritis correlated better with a positive DMSA renal scan in the older children than in the younger children; 85% of the DMSA renal scans were positive in group III; 69% in group II; 48% in group I (P<0.001). Vesicoureteral reflux detected by contrast VCUG was more prevalent in the younger age groups. Although high grades of reflux (grade IV-V) correlated better with a positive DMSA renal scan, it did not reach a level of statistical significance (P>0.05). RUS did not correlate with a positive DMSA renal scan in any age group."

On the basis of previous experimental studies, DMSA scintigraphy was used as the standard of reference for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. The DMSA scans showed changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 63% (57/91) of the patients. Sonograms showed changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 24% (22/91) of the whole group and in only 39% (22/57) of the patients with scintigraphically documented acute pyelonephritis. Pertinent sonographic findings were areas of increased cortical echogenicity in 14 patients and decreased echogenicity in eight, including three patients with renal abscesses. Dilatation of the renal collecting system was noted in nine patients and renal enlargement was noted in three. We conclude that renal sonography is a relatively insensitive test for the detection of acute inflammatory changes of renal cortex. Therefore, it should not be used as the primary imaging technique for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. However, sonography is a useful technique in evaluating the nature of the defects seen on the DMSA scan and in detecting obstructive uropathies that may be associated with urinary tract infections."

Urinary tract infection is the most common serious bacterial infection in children. The aim of this study was to compare the value of different laboratory and imaging techniques in detecting renal involvement in acute pyelonephritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In a cross-sectional study of patients 1 month to 14 years of age diagnosed with urinary tract infection were examined with systemic inflammatory markers, renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), and technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy. A total of 1467 pediatric patients were eligible for treatment of pyelonephritis. Evaluations included a complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urinalysis, urine culture, and measurement of serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. RESULTS. The results of (99m)Tc-DMSA scans were normal in 20.2%, mild decreased cortical uptake in 45.0%, moderate decreased cortical uptake in 12.3%, severe decreased cortical uptake in 12.0%, and decreased cortical function plus irregularity or scar formation in 10.5%. Voiding cystourethrography showed vesicoureteral reflux in 25.9%. The sensitivity of (99m)Tc-DMSA for prediction of vesicoureteral reflux was 84.1% with a negative predictive value of 80.6%. Significant differences were found in the level of blood leukocyte count (P = .03), urine leukocyte count (P = .003), ESR (P = .008), and age (P = .04) between patients with normal and abnormal (99m)Tc-DMSA scan results.

Sixty subjects with the suspicion of APN were included. The kidneys were divided into three zones: each was graded as positive, equivocal or negative for renal defects. To evaluate inter-observer variation, each study was read in a double-blind fashion by two nuclear physicians. Renal defects were found in 24 patients (31 kidneys and 47 zones) with posterior 180 degrees SPECT, 23 patients (29 kidneys and 44 zones) with 360 degrees SPECT (McNemar's test, P = 0.375 for zones) and 15 patients (16 kidneys and 24 zones) with planar image (P = 0.001 for zones, vs 180 degrees and 360 degrees SPECT). The proportion of positive agreement for posterior 180 degrees and 360 degrees SPECT between readers for the presence of renal defects was 0.81 and 0.62, respectively, whereas the proportion of negative agreement was 0.92 and 0.87, respectively.

CD009185,0,21563436,0,[Urinary tract infections in children by pediatric urologist].,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection disease in all age. From the pediatric urology point of view, difficulty in bladder emptying is the most favorable factor for UTI. Early ultrasonographic (USG) investigation is necessary to detect urinary obstruction and urolithiasis. It is important to perform USG with filled bladder and directly after micturition. Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) should be done after UTI in small children (below 3 years of age). For the detection of renal damage the DMSA-scan is the most sensitive method that should be performed during UTI and 6 months later. In case of bladder dysfunction suspicion the uroflowmetry is substantial. Detection of leucocyturia give rise to microbiological diagnosis and proper treatment. UTI with fever needs antibiotic therapy started in first 24 hours to prevent renal damage. Risk factor for recurrences are bladder dysfunction and residual urine. Prophylaxis should not be restricted to the use of antibiotics or other prophylactic agents but must include the efficient management of bladder and bowel dysfunction and proper liquids administration."
CD009185,0,1671774,0,The receptor repertoire defines the host range for attaching Escherichia coli strains that recognize globo-A.,"Escherichia coli strains which colonize the human urinary tract express lectins specific for different members of the globoseries of glycolipids, e.g., globotetraosylceramide and globo-A. This study investigated the importance of globo-A expression for attachment to human uroepithelial cells, colonization of the urinary tract, and severity of urinary tract infection. The expression of receptor-active glycolipids by erythrocytes and epithelial cells was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and bacterial overlay as well as by bacterial binding to those cells. The epithelial expression of the globo-A receptor was restricted to individuals of blood group A with a positive secretor state. Consequently, globo-A binding E. coli strains attached only to epithelial cells from these individuals. In contrast, globoside-recognizing strains attached in similar numbers to uroepithelial cells regardless of the ABH blood group and secretor state of the donor. The role of host receptor expression for infection with globo-A-specific E. coli was analyzed in 1,473 children with urinary tract infections. All those infected with strains exclusively expressing globo-A-specific adhesins were found to be of blood group A, compared with 45% in the population at large (P less than 0.006). The inflammatory response (fever, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) of individuals infected with these strains was lower than that in individuals with infections caused by globoside binding strains. The results demonstrate the importance of fitness between host receptors and bacterial adhesins for infection and suggest that minor receptor epitope differences have profound effects on the disease process."

CD009185,0,9817092,0,Improved ultrasound detection of renal scarring in children following urinary tract infection.,"A system for defining renal scarring on ultrasound is proposed and compared with DMSA scintigraphy. Renal scarring was assessed with ultrasound in children following urinary tract infection (UTI) using the following criteria: (1) proximity of sinus echoes to cortical surface; (2) loss of pyramids; (3) irregularity of outline; (4) loss of definition of capsular echo; and (5) calyceal dilatation. Three hundred and thirty-nine consecutive ultrasound scans (US) and DMSA scintigrams, comprising 648 kidneys, were performed and reported blindly and the results were compared. Using DMSA scintigraphy as the gold standard, ultrasound had a positive predictive value of 93% and a negative predictive value of 95%. Ultrasound disagreed with DMSA scintigraphy in 5.2% of kidneys. On review of the cases of disagreement where arbitration was possible by comparison with other imaging, ultrasound was incorrect in 10 kidneys and DMSA was incorrect in 13. We conclude that the sensitivity in the ultrasound detection of renal scarring can be greatly improved using this method. If no scars were detected at ultrasound an alternative explanation for an abnormal DMSA scintigram should be sought."

CD009185,0,9853352,0,The importance of 99Tcm-DMSA renal scintigraphy in the follow-up of acute pyelonephritis in children: comparison with urographic data.,"At present, 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy is the most sensitive examination for the detection of parenchymal damage during acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children. This prospective study had three aims: (1) to evaluate the medium-term evolution of the scintigraphic abnormalities, to find a prognostic criterion of scintigraphic evolution; (2) to assess the correlation between the severity of early or late scintigraphic damage and selected clinical factors; and (3) to compare the permanent scintigraphic renal scars with intravenous urography (IVU) 2 years after the acute infection. Seventy-four children (mean age 32 months), presenting with a first clinical episode of pyelonephritis and an initial scintigraphic abnormality, were included in the study. Patients with a history of urinary tract infection (UTI), uropathy other than vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) and a relapse of acute pyelonephritis were excluded. All children underwent control scintigraphy (mean 9 months after APN) and 43 had an IVU (mean 26 months after APN). Fifty-seven children (77%) still have scintigraphic abnormalities of varying severity (7 atrophic kidneys). Initial relative DMSA uptake of less than 45% results in a worse scintigraphic prognosis. The age of the child has no bearing on the severity of the initial renal involvement or on the evolution of the scintigraphic abnormalities. The rapid introduction of antibiotics (< 12 h) significantly improves the scintigraphic prognosis (P < 0.01). The presence of reflux (n = 39) leads to more serious initial damage, but we did not find any effect on later evolution in this study, in which all reflux was low grade in nature. Among the 43 children who had an IVU, 5 showed typical urographic and scintigraphic renal scars in the corresponding region and 38 showed a normal IVU with 28 cases of scintigraphic abnormalities. A DMSA scan is more sensitive than IVU for the detection of renal scarring after a first episode of APN."

CD009185,0,20556431,0,Evaluating different imaging strategies in children after first febrile urinary tract infection.,"We conducted a retrospective multicenter review to estimate the prevalence of urological abnormalities in Chinese children with first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) and to evaluate the selective imaging strategy recommended by the NICE guideline for detecting underlying abnormalities. Atypical UTI was defined as in the NICE UTI guideline. Overall, 576 boys and 244 girls aged below 24 months were reviewed. All underwent ultrasound (US) and micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) and 612 underwent DMSA scans. US was abnormal in 73 (8.9%) and vesicoureteral reflux was shown in 195 patients (23.8%). A total of 126 patients were considered to have remediable urological abnormalities requiring additional surgical or medical interventions. The NICE guideline yielded excellent negative predictive values (NPV) of 100-94.4% in girls but 91% in boys. If all boys underwent US and DMSA and only those with atypical UTI or abnormal US or DMSA proceeded to MCUG, then the NPV increased to 95.2% and 97.4% for boys aged below and above 6 months, respectively. These revised strategies would substantially save invasive studies-DMSA and MCUG in 27 and 74% of girls aged below and above 6 months, respectively, or MCUG in 23 and 59% of boys aged below and above 6 months, respectively."

This study was performed to compare and assess the efficacy of Power Doppler Ultrasound versus Tc-99m DMSA scan for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. A quasi experimental study was conducted on 34 children with mean age of 2.8 ± 2.7 years who were hospitalized with their first episode of febrile urinary tract infection. All children were evaluated in the first 3 days of admission by Doppler Ultrasound and Tc-99m DMSA scan. Patients with congenital structural anomalies were excluded. Each kidney was divided into three zones. The comparison between efficacy of Doppler Ultrasound and DMSA scan was carried out based on number of patients and on classified renal units. Based on the number of patients enrolled; the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy of Doppler Ultrasound were 89%, 53%, 70%, 80% and 74%, respectively but based on the renal units, it was 66%, 81%, 46%, 91% and 79% , respectively.

CD009185,0,16085971,0,Evaluation of the use of DMSA in culture positive UTI and culture negative acute pyelonephritis.,"This prospective study was done to assess the frequency of acute pyelonephritis (APN) in febrile children with positive urine culture as documented by Tc99m DMSA scintigraphy (DMSA) and the frequency of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in these children. Secondly, to determine the frequency of APN, in febrile children with supportive evidence for UTI but with negative urine culture, as documented by DMSA and frequency of VUR in them. Thirdly to stress the utility of DMSA to diagnose APN in urine culture negative febrile children and to suggest DMSA as a clinical tool in evaluation of fever of unknown origin (FUO). This study included 42 children with positive urine culture and 26 children with negative urine culture who had supportive evidence of UTI as determined by the predetermined criteria and diagnosed to have APN by DMSA. All of them had ultrasonogram (USG), DMSA and voiding cystourethrogram (VCU). They were followed up for a minimum period of 6 months. Out of the 42 children with positive urine culture 92.9% had features of APN in the DMSA of whom 82.1% had vesicoureteric relux (VUR). The DMSA was abnormal in 26 children with negative urine culture, of whom 65.4% had VUR. Ultrasound suggestive of parenchymal change was observed in 47.6% in the culture positive group and 65.4% in the culture negative group. In conclusion, it is suggested, that DMSA is a useful investigation for the diagnosis of APN in febrile UTI. DMSA is indicated in febrile children with negative urine culture but with supportive evidence of UTI and in FUO. An abnormal DMSA is a strong indication for work up for VUR."

CD009185,0,15286264,0,Procalcitonin: a marker of severity of acute pyelonephritis among children.,"Febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common problem among children. The diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. The distinction between acute pyelonephritis and UTI without renal involvement is very important, because renal infection may cause parenchymal scarring and thus requires more aggressive investigation and follow-up monitoring. However, this distinction is not easy among children, because common clinical findings and laboratory parameters are nonspecific, especially among young children. In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from febrile UTI without renal lesions in a group of 100 children, we measured serum levels of procalcitonin (PCT), a new marker of infection. The objective of the study was to determine the accuracy of PCT measurements, compared with C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements, in diagnosing acute renal involvement during febrile UTI and in predicting subsequent scars, as assessed with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy."
CD009185,0,9291203,0,Congenitally small kidneys with reflux as a common cause of nephropathy in boys.,"Congenital maldevelopment is sometimes found in small kidneys with ureteral reflux. However, the incidence of congenitally small kidneys and the frequency of its association with ureteral reflux remains unknown. Ultrasound scanning, performed in 4,000 apparently healthy neonates or young infants (males 2,129, females 1,871), detected 51 children suspected of having small kidneys. A careful ultrasound re-examination performed one month later in 45 of the 51 children confirmed small kidneys in eight children, one bilateral and seven unilateral. Dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) renoscintigraphy revealed small kidneys with generally diminished uptake in six infants and no uptake unilaterally in the other two infants. One of the 12 children, who had normal findings on the initial scanning and subsequently developed urinary infection, was later diagnosed having unilateral small kidney with generally reduced DMSA uptake. All seven infants having small kidneys with reduced tracer uptake were male (incidence, 1:300 boys). All eight small kidneys in the seven boys and four of the six contralateral non-small kidneys were associated with ureteral reflux, while neither of the two infants with a non-functioning kidney had ureteral reflux. Serial ultrasounds documented the poor growth of all small kidneys. Thus, congenitally small kidneys with generally diminished DMSA uptake were highly associated with ureteral reflux and especially observed in boys."

In this report the authors aim to report a child with a novel de novo interstitial deletion on chromosome 7, with the following karyotype: 46,XX,del(7)(p14.2 p15.1). We described a female, born at 38 weeks with intrauterine growth restriction and feeding problems with episodes of cyanosis after feedings and failure to thrive. Physical examination showed low implantation of ears, hypertelorism, oblique palpebral fissures, retrognathia, and palate ogived, with insertion anomalies of the toes, poor facial expression and mild axial hypotonia. Transfontanelar ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, bronchofibroscopy and metabolic studies were normal. She was hospitalized until the 32nd day of life.

CD009185,0,781306,0,Estimating relative renal function.,"Radionuclide measurements of relative renal function have been made using conventional dual-probe renography, computer assisted triple-probe renography, rectilinear kidney scanning and computer assisted gamma camera renography and kidney scanning. The relative area of each kidney from the excretory urogram also has been used to measure relative function. The best correlation between renography and kidney scanning was obtained with the gamma camera computer system. The relative function of each kidney was obtained by outlining regions of interest that corresponded closely to the renal images and subtracting the blood and tissue background activity, using a special background region. Triple-probe renography, using computer assisted blood background subtraction, provides another reliable indicator of relative function, which is considerably more accurate than conventional dual-probe renography. Relative renal function also may be determined, but with less precision, from the relative counts in a rectilinear kidney scan, from the relative scan areas and from the relative areas found on excretory urography. Both relative area methods are less reliable in the presence of outflow tract obstruction, renal tumors and renal cysts."

A randomised multi-centre trial was conducted in 365 children aged 6 months to 16 years with bacterial growth in cultures from urine collected by catheter. The children were assigned to receive either oral ceftibuten (9 mg/kg once daily) for 14 days or intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) for 3 days followed by oral ceftibuten for 11 days. Only patients with lesions detected on acute-phase dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy underwent follow-up scintigraphy. Efficacy was evaluated by the rate of renal scarring after 6 months on follow-up scintigraphy. Of 219 children with lesions on acute-phase scintigraphy, 152 completed the study; 80 (72 females, median age 2.2 years) were given ceftibuten and 72 (62 females, median age 1.6 years) were given ceftriaxone/ceftibuten. Patients in the intravenous/oral group had significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations at baseline and larger lesion(s) on acute-phase scintigraphy. Follow-up scintigraphy showed renal scarring in 21/80 children treated with ceftibuten and 33/72 with ceftriaxone/ceftibuten (p = 0.01). However, after adjustment for the confounding variables (CRP and size of acute-phase lesion), no significant difference was observed for renal scarring between the two groups (p = 0.2). Renal scarring correlated with the extent of the acute-phase lesion (r = 0.60, p < 0.0001) and the grade of vesico-ureteric reflux (r = 0.31, p = 0.03), and was more frequent in refluxing renal units (p = 0.04). The majority of patients, i.e. 44 in the oral group and 47 in the intravenous/oral group, were managed as out-patients. Side effects were not observed. From this study, we can conclude that once-daily oral ceftibuten for 14 days yielded comparable results to sequential ceftriaxone/ceftibuten treatment in children aged 6 months to 16 years with DMSA-documented acute pyelonephritis and it allowed out-patient management in the majority of these children."

Colour Doppler sonography (CDS) and ACDS examinations were performed in 180 renal units (90 patients; age range newborn to 16 years) with unilateral or bilateral renal disease (e.g. reflux nephropathy, renal scars, end-stage renal disease, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, urinary tract infection, renal failure, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (LE), renal biopsy, congenital dysplasia, tumour/infiltration). The ACDS results were compared with scintigraphy or CT as well as to clinical findings. Amplitude colour-coded Doppler sonography accurately demonstrated normal vasculature in 49 of 51 healthy kidneys (= 96%); 3 healthy kidneys could not be evaluated due to motion/artefacts. In 39 of 43 kidneys with focally altered perfusion ACDS could be performed and correctly depicted focally impaired vasculature/perfusion in 35 kidneys (= 89.7%). Seventy-three of 83 kidneys with diffusely impaired perfusion could be evaluated by ACDS and altered pattern was correctly depicted in 58 kidneys (= 79.4%), with an overall percentage of agreement of 87.1%. Amplitude CDS appears to be useful in infants and children. Compared with CDS it improves visualisation of especially focally impaired vasculature/perfusion and should be considered a valuable adjunct to conventional investigations."

Antenatal diagnosis is the ideal, so that postnatal urinary antibiotic prophylaxis and appropriate investigations can be organised. Postnatal investigations should assess both upper and lower urinary tract. Renal and bladder ultrasound and radiographic micturating cystourethragraphy under antibiotic cover will both detect vesicoureteric reflux and assess any bladder outlet obstruction due to the ureterocele. Renal function, particularly of the upper moiety, is best evaluated by technetium Tc99m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan. Both function and obstruction can be quantitated by the Tc99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine isotope scan with intravenous volume expansion (10 ml/kg) and furosemide diuresis (1 mg/kg). Intravenous urography provides the best anatomic information when the upper moiety is functional. The surgical management is based on the clinical situation, which is often variable, and therefore needs to be tailored for each patient. The general principles include restoration of anatomy to as near normal as possible and preservation of functional renal tissue."

CD009185,0,2158539,0,Detection of renal scarring by DMSA scanning--an experimental study.,"Using the established piglet model, renal scars were produced by a combination of vesicoureteric reflux and urinary infection. The presence and extent of scarring, as determined by postmortem examination, was compared with that detected by technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans performed before sacrifice. Sixty female piglets (62 refluxing units) were studied. Overall the sensitivity (true-positive/(true-positive + false-negative)) of DMSA scanning in detecting macroscopic scarring was 85% and the specificity (true-negative/(true-negative + false-positive)) was 97%. There were five false-negatives, four of which were in kidneys with minor scarring and one in which there was major scarring. There were three false-positives. We conclude that DMSA scanning has a high specificity and sensitivity in detecting renal scars in female piglets, and suggest it is the preferred method for detecting renal scars in clinical practice."

Significance for differential diagnosis of rejection and infections after kidney transplantation].,"The value of measuring the urinary concentration of alpha 2-macroglobulin in addition to that of C-reactive protein (CRP) was assessed in a prospective study of 78 consecutive patients (29 women, 49 men; mean age 48.7 [19-75] years) after renal transplantation. alpha 2-Macroglobulin was never demonstrated in urine when the course was normal (n = 38), cytomegalovirus infection had occurred (n = 26) or acute cyclosporin nephrotoxicity (n = 5) or glomerular disease in the transplant (n = 10). CRP was present in only a few such cases. Interstitial rejections (n = 26) always led to urinary alpha 2-macroglobulin and CRP excretion without haematuria, while in vascular rejection (n = 3) the haemoglobin test was also positive. Urinary infection (n = 20) and urosepticaemia (n = 6) always brought about the urinary excretion of alpha 2-macroglobulin and CRP, as well as a usually highly positive haemoglobin test. alpha 2-Macroglobulin was absent but CRP always present in extrarenal bacterial infections (n = 30). Postrenal blood admixture was always characterized by a positive haemoglobin test and alpha 2-macroglobulin in urine, while in most cases (83%) CRP was absent. --These results indicate that the constellation ""alpha 2-macroglobulin negative/CRP positive"" is a pathognomonic for extrarenal bacterial infection (sensitivity 100%, specificity 98.9%). The presence of alpha 2-macroglobulin alone makes postrenal blood admixture probable. If both proteins are present in the urine, rejection and urogenital bacterial infection must be excluded by further tests."

We obtained a positive predictive value of 82%, and a negative predictive value of 97%, i.e. the method is very sensitive, albeit less specific. Sequential imaging showed around 50% of the scintigrams to turn positive at 30 min after the injection, the most rapid accumulation being seen in cases of superficial soft tissue infections and in pulmonary and pleural infections, cerebral abscesses showing a rather sluggish accretion of activity, urinary tract infections, abdominal abscesses and bowel inflammation accumulating activity at an intermediate rate. Our results indicate that the described method is sensitive, and that the sequential scintigraphic approach allows an early diagnosis in most cases, and facilitates the interpretation of delayed scans."

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of vitamin A on the rate of permanent renal damage in children with acute pyelonephritis. Fifty children, median age of 24 months (range 2-144), with first-time pyelonephritis verified by an uptake defect on acute dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan were included in the study and randomly allocated to the case or control groups. All were given intravenous ceftriaxone for 10 days followed by oral cephalexin for 3 months. Cases in addition were given a single intramuscular dose of vitamin A, 25,000 U for infants below 1 year of age and 50,000 U for older children. At the repeat DMSA scan after 3 months, five of 25 cases (20%) and 17 of 25 controls (68%) had abnormal findings (p = 0.001). In conclusion, administration of vitamin A was associated with a significantly lower rate of permanent renal damage."

There were 63 males and 26 females; ages ranged from neonates to 14 years. UTI was diagnosed on the basis of a positive urine culture, VUR was diagnosed and graded by micturating cystourethrogram (MCU), and renal scarring was assessed by technetium 99 m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Ultrasonography (US) was done to evaluate renal tract dilatation and other structural abnormalities. A follow up DMSA scan was performed approximately 6 months after the initial scan. VUR was present in 106 of the 171 renal units in which it was studied and absent in 65 units. The majority of the VUR was grade V. Renal scars were seen in 90 of 177 renal units at presentation and in 72 of the 163 renal units studied at follow-up. Some information was lacking in 31 patients; hence, the correlation between UTI, VUR, and renal scarring was done in 58 patients. The majority of the suspected scars at presentation were not seen at follow-up, but most of the established scars persisted. Only 2 renal units showed scars for the first time on follow-up. On US, approximately 50% of normal kidneys showed either suspicious or established scars on DMSA scan, and patients with bilateral abnormality on US showed renal scars. Renal scars were seen in 15 of 23 children without VUR, 17 of 18 with unilateral VUR, and 16 of 17 with bilateral VUR. Thus, there is a cause-and-effect relationship between UTI and renal scarring that is made worse by VUR. DMSA scans have been shown to be the most reliable method of assessing renal scarring, and an abnormal US scan showing upper-tract dilatation or a structural abnormality may have a predictive value in the detection of renal scarring."

Bacteremic patients (n=24) had higher serum IL-6 at inclusion and throughout the first 24 h (P<. 01) and higher urine IL-6 from 6 h after start of therapy (P<.01) than did nonbacteremic patients (n=57). The serum and urine IL-6 responses remained elevated longer in the bacteremic group. Patients with clinical signs of pyelonephritis had higher serum and urine IL-6 concentrations than did other patients in the study population (P=.058, P<.01, respectively). IL-6 high responders had higher temperatures (P<.05) and C-reactive protein levels (P<.05, P<.01) than did low responders. The results demonstrate that IL-6 responses accompany febrile UTIs regardless of bacteremia and that the response reflects disease severity.

CD009185,0,18830717,0,The risk factors of recurrent urinary tract infection in infants with normal urinary systems.,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) frequently recurs and increases the risk of renal scarring even in infants with normal urinary tracts. Our study was aimed to find preventive measures for recurrent UTI in these infants. One-hundred ninety infants, who were diagnosed with their first febrile UTI and were proven to have normal urinary systems, were enrolled. We investigated the incidence of recurrent UTI during the following year and the following risk factors: gender, young age, phimosis, vaginal reflux, and acute pyelonephritis (APN) diagnosed by 99m-technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA)(+) scintigraphy. The incidence of recurrent UTI was 21.1%. The difference in recurrence rate according to gender was not significant. The recurrence rate in infants less than 6 months of age was 25.8%, which was significantly higher than the 7.7% in older infants (P = 0.045). In male infants with persistent non-retractile prepuces, recurrent UTI developed in 34.0%, which was significantly higher than the 17.6% in male infants with retractile prepuces (P = 0.022). The presence of APN in male infants increased the likelihood of recurrent UTI when analyzed by multivariate logistic regression [odds ratio 4.6, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.6-13.0, P = 0.003]. The presence of vaginal reflux and APN in female infants gave no significant difference to the incidence of recurrent UTI. In infants with normal urinary systems, age less than 6 months, non-retractile prepuces and APN in male infants, were the most important risk factors for recurrent UTIs. It is suggested that non-retractile prepuces should be adequately treated to become retractile in young male infants with APN."

Ninety-nine children, aged 1.1-12.3 years, with 198 potentially refluxing units, were investigated simultaneously by DRVC and USVC. The indications for cystography were urinary tract infection, follow-up of a previously detected VUR, and screening of siblings of children with VUR. During the investigation an echo-enhancing agent (Levovist) was administered intravesically through a catheter already in place for the DRVC. The movement of both agents, radiotracer and Levovist, was registered simultaneously by a computerized gamma camera and US, respectively. The results were analyzed with DRVC representing the reference diagnostic test. The overall sensitivity and specificity of USVC for the detection of VUR were 79% and 92%, respectively.

The pathophysiologic changes in acute pyelonephritis include tubulointerstitial inflammation/pus with impairment of the renal microcirculation due to compression of the glomeruli, small peritubular capillaries and vasa recta by interstitial edema.

CD009185,0,2282201,0,Bacterial adherence as a virulence factor in urinary tract infection.,"Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes greater than 90% of urinary tract infections, UTI, in childhood. The capacity to adhere to urinary tract epithelial cells characterizes E. coli strains that cause acute pyelonephritis. Adherence of uropathogenic E. coli is the result of a specific interaction between bacterial adhesins and glycolipid receptors on the host cells, especially the globoseries of glycolipids which share the Galactose alpha 1-greater than 4Galactose beta disaccharide (Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta). In childhood UTI, Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta-binding bacteria caused significantly higher body temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and pyuria, and lower renal concentrating capacity, than E. coli lacking this specificity. The Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta-binding bacteria thus appeared to be more potent inducers of inflammation than other strains. Since inflammation may lead to tissue damage we examined the relationship of infection with Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta-positive bacteria to renal scarring. The frequency of renal scarring was 5% in boys with Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta-positive and 40% in boys with Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta-negative E. coli. Bacterial binding to Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta can be detected with a commercially available test reagent. This reagent can thus be used as an effective predictor of risk for renal scarring. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pyrogen and inducer of the acute phase reactants. It was shown to be produced locally in the urinary tract, in response to UTI, and to spread systemically. Mucosal challenge with dead bacteria was sufficient to induce the IL-6 response. Circulating IL-6, and/or IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor could explain the fever, as well as increased ESR and CRP found in association with acute symptomatic UTI."

CD009185,0,11130188,0,[Infection in the elderly--what is different?].,"Infectious diseases are a common cause of increased morbidity and mortality in elderly patients and present a frequent problem in the geriatrician's daily practice. Infections in the elderly are quite different from infections in a younger population. These differences are due to Age-related alterations in immunology Different epidemiology and bacteriology Increased morbidity and mortality Altered clinical presentation Concommittant disability and comorbidity in many older patients Different approaches to therapy. This article is an attempt to discuss these various aspects of infectious disease in the elderly. The most important infections in the elderly are caused by bacteria. Incidence and bacterial spectrum depends on the site of infection and whether the patient is hospitalized, living in a nursing home or in the community. Pneumonia, UTI and pressure ulcer infections are more frequent in patients living in nursing homes than in community dwelling older people. Infections are a frequent cause of hospitalization in elderly people and hospitalization on the other hand is a risk factor for life-threatening nosocomial infections, caused by invasive diagnostic procedures and frequent use of urinary and venous catheters. Infections in the elderly are often accompanied by serious complications as bacteriemia (pneumonia), frequent recurrence (UTI), perforation and abscess (abdominal infections) and severe disability (pressure ulcer infections). Because of these serious and frequent complications mortality of infections is higher in older patients than in younger people. Elderly patients with infectious disease often present in the same way as younger patients do. Many elderly however present with non-specific clinical symptoms and non-specific functional decline which makes an accurate diagnosis difficult and may lead to a life-threatening delay of diagnosis and therapy. In older patients with unexplained functional decline, physicians must be aware of the possibility of a serious infection. Moreover, the physician can not rely on typical signs of infections as fever. In the elderly the fever response is often blunted even in the presence of bacteremia. Leokocytosis may be absent and elevation of acute phase protein is a more reliable marker of infection than elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Clinical suspicion of bacterial infection in elderly patient should prompt Careful anamnesis and clinical investigation Hospitalization if necessary Diagnostic procedures without delay including blood cultures Immediate empiric antibiotic therapy taking into account the site of infection, if the infection is community acquired or nosocomial and the most likely bacterial spectrum and local resistance factors.

The diagnoses for admission included several surgically treated specialties (obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedics and traumatology, oncology and general surgery). Pefloxacin was provided in 5 ml ampoules containing 400 mg of active principle to administer by slow intravenous perfusion (1 hour) diluted in 5% glucose solution. The multicentre study was open and non-comparative. The physician could choose between two different dosage schedules to use for surgical prophylaxis. The ultrashort schedule consisted of treatment with 2 ampoules (800 mg), given in the hour before the operation (followed for 217 cases).

Even though this defect is common among siblings and parents of index patients (27-40%), the mode of inheritance is not well defined. Parents and siblings (three female and two male) of a 13-year-old girl with end-stage renal failure (ESRF) due to reflux nephropathy were screened for VUR although they had not presented episodes of urinary tract infection. VUR was identified in the father (44 years old) and in all the three sisters (aged 15 years, 16 years and 18 years) while the two brothers (aged 5 years and 8 years) had normal renal ultrasonograms and cystograms. A technetium-99m di-mercapto-succinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scan demonstrated renal scars in the father and in two of the sisters with VUR. No episodes of urinary infection had been documented for any relatives. Haplotype analysis on the X-chromosome confirmed paternity. This is the first description of VUR compatible with an X-dominant trait. This mode of inheritance must be added to what is already known on familial VUR, and future studies should also consider this possibility."
CD009185,0,1500753,0,Comparison of urine and serum concentrations of interleukin-6 in women with acute pyelonephritis or asymptomatic bacteriuria.,"The mucosal and systemic interleukin-6 (IL-6) response to urinary tract infection was analyzed in women with acute pyelonephritis or asymptomatic bacteriuria. Urine and serum samples were obtained at diagnosis and after treatment. IL-6 activity was elevated in urine samples from most bacteriuric women, regardless of the severity of infection. Urinary levels greater than 20 units/mL occurred in 25 of 29 women with acute pyelonephritis and in 36 of 42 women with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Elevated serum IL-6 levels were found mainly in patients with acute pyelonephritis: Levels greater than 20 units/mL occurred in 14 of 28 women with acute pyelonephritis compared with 0 of 28 women with asymptomatic bacteriuria. These results suggest that bacteriuria is accompanied by elevated urinary IL-6 levels and that this IL-6 is locally produced. The spread of IL-6 to the circulation in patients with acute pyelonephritis may contribute to the elevation of fever and C-reactive protein characteristic of the disease."

This observational study was carried out at León Hospital (Spain) on 35 patients (ten boys) aged between 0 and 14 years with urinary tract infection. Urinary levels of IL-6 were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at diagnosis and after recovery. Renal dimercaptosuccinate acid (DMSA) scan was performed on all patients to discard or confirm acute pyelonephritis. The mean urinary concentration [x +/- standard deviation (SD)] of IL-6 at diagnosis was 20.3 +/- 23.3 and 5.3 +/- 9.7 pg/ml in patients with acute pyelonephritis and lower urinary infection, respectively [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6-27.4; p < 0.01]. Specificity for a value of IL-6 >15 pg/ml, was 94.1% (95% CI: 91.1-97.1). Positive predictive value for IL-6 >15 pg/ml was 87.5% (95% CI: 81.1-93.8). IL-6 was undetectable in the urine of both groups of patients at the time of recovery. Urinary levels of IL-6 are useful in differentiating between upper and lower urinary tract infection in children. In this clinical setting, a value >15 pg/ml is a strong indicator of acute pyelonephritis."
CD009185,0,9859510,0,"[Bladder malfunction, urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux in children].","A correlation between urinary tract infection, vesicoureteral reflux and voiding disorders has increasingly been reported. Voiding dysfunction increases the incidence of recurrent urinary tract infection, induces and perpetuates vesicoureteral reflux, even after surgical antireflux treatment, and may result in permanent renal damage. The resolution of the primary cause with voiding normalization is essential to achieve good results in the treatment of secondary problems such as urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux. Thirty seven children with vesicoureteral reflux secondary to voiding disorders were diagnosed and treated between 1990 and 1995 (five years). Forty-nine ureters were studied. The subjects became symptomatic between 1 month and 13 years of age, with the occurrence of urinary tract infection. All children were neurologically and morphologically normal. Symptoms suggesting bladder instability were detected in 34 (91.9%) and dysfunctional sphincter obstruction in three (8.1%). These patients were all evaluated with a renal/bladder sonogram and voiding cystogram, complemented in 17 (45.9%) with urodynamic testing that confirmed clinical diagnosis. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans performed on 29 (78.4%) children revealed renal damage in 26 (89.6%). A treatment program of bladder retraining and bowel habit normalization was encouraged in every child, anti-cholinergic drugs were associated in 23 (62.2%), muscle-relaxant drugs in three (8.1%), phenoxybenzamine and intermittent catheterization were used in one child (2.7%). Urinary tract infection prophylaxis was instituted in 34 (91.9%) children. Urinary tract infection was completely resolved in 35 (94.6%) patients, and its frequency decreased in two (5.4%). Thirty-two children (86.5%) with vesicoureteral reflux were cured and four (10.8%) were improved. Evidence of voiding disfunction ceased in 22 (59.5%) cases and improved in 14 (37.8%) with a reduction in the frequency and intensity of complaints. Urgency syndrome and vesicoureteral reflux remained unchanged in one child (2.7%). These findings imply that detection and treatment of bladder/sphincter disfunction are essential in every child with the complex of recurrent urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux."

When no R.N. was present, grade of reflux was < IV, and age < 12 years, a non surgical treatment was indicated."
CD009185,0,7506886,0,Value of serum C-reactive protein concentrations in febrile children without apparent focus.,"We examined the value of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in febrile children without an apparent focus of infection, (i) as a tool to differentiate bacteraemia and bacterial infection from a non-bacterial illness (NBI), and (ii) as an indicator of recovery or complications. Included in the study were 100 children up to the age of 3 years with a temperature of > or = 38.5 degrees C, without an apparent focus. The serum CRP concentration was measured on days 1, 3 and 5 of evaluation and correlated with the final diagnosis and outcome. The serum CRP was 40 mg/l and above in 95% of patients (18/19) with bacteraemia and also in seven of the eight with purulent meningitis, while it was < 40 mg/l in 84% of patients (52/62) with NBI (mean (SD) 22 (28.6) mg/l). The mean serum CRP concentration among six children with a culture-positive urinary tract infection (16.3 (8.3) mg/l) and five with otitis media (9 (5.7) mg/l) was similar to those with NBI. The sensitivity of serum CRP > or = 40 mg/l for diagnosis of bacteraemia was 95% and the positive predictive value 67%. On serial monitoring, a fall in the CRP concentration was a sensitive indicator of recovery from infection and provided the earliest clue to therapeutic response long before a fall in temperature."

Different immunological and nonimmunological mechanisms initiated by infectious and non-infectious factors may lead to TN. A case of 13-years-old girl with primary diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is presented. The abdominal pain, headache, pain in lumbar region and intermittent fever with loss of appetite were observed in this girl a few weeks before admission. Microcytic anemia, proteinuria and glucosuria, azotemia and elevated markers of inflammatory response were found. In ultrasound examination heterogenous cortex echogenicity of both kidneys and disturbances in parenchymal blood flow were observed. In renal scintigraphy the discriminated catch index was found. Kidney biopsy revealed the edema of the interstitial space with mononuclear and lymphocyte infiltration. The diagnosis of TN was established upon the history, clinical examination, results of laboratory tests, kidney imaging and biopsy. After steroid and doxycycline treatment an improvement and normalization of the results of laboratory tests were observed. It seems to be justified to consider Yersinia infection as a cause of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis."

The occasional disappearance of reflux during conservative treatment should not be mistaken for cure because of its variable nature. To avoid such a mistake voiding cystography under fluoroscopic monitoring is repeated indefinitely. Those patients who were treated surgically were followed for at least 2 to 3 years before cure was established. Transient ureteral dilatation after reimplantation was eradicated within 3 months. Postoperative urinary infection was observed at various intervals, ranging from 1 week to 5 months, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was likely to be influenced by infection. Postoperative chemotherapy was continued until the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal and there was no infection and/or dilatation of the upper tract."

However, with developments and improvements of other imaging modalities, its diagnostic significance may have changed. To probe that issue, recent 65 scans for the patients with fever of unknown origin were reviewed retrospectively. Of these, 56 had sufficient clinical assessment and laboratory examinations to evaluate causative illnesses. Gallium images of 33 patients were interpreted as positive. Local inflammatory lesions were detected in 23 cases, with lung tuberculosis, urinary tract infection, and inflammatory joint diseases as prevalent final diagnoses. Pyogenic abscesses, though popular in the literatures on fever of unknown origin, were found in only 2 cases in our present series. This seemed to be due to earlier detection of affected sites by other imaging technics. Osteomyelitis, other major cause of fever in the past, was not found this time, probably owing to wide use of antibiotics. Besides localized diseases, seven cases of generalized disorders were found. There were 3 patients with hematological malignancies, 3 with systemic autoimmune diseases, and 1 with severe infectious mononucleosis. There were three false positive cases; intestinal gallium radioactivity in 2 cases and physiological pulmonary hilar accumulation in 1 were erroneously read as abnormal. Of 23 cases with negative gallium scan, no definite cause of fever were found in 19; twelve patients had spontaneous reduction of fever, 2 did so with antibiotics, and 5 with corticosteroids. False negative cases were; two with urinary tract infection on antibiotics, one with bacterial meningitis, and one with polyarteritis nodosa. Our results reconfirmed the excellent sensitivity and accuracy of gallium scan in the diagnosis of fever of unknown origin. In addition to the detection of focal inflammations, it may sometimes contribute to an early diagnosis of unexpected systemic diseases. From the results obtained, it is advisable that, in patients with fever of unknown origin, this test should be done early in diagnostic schedule and before administration of drugs that may mask potential sites of abnormal accumulation."

Diuretic 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) dynamic scintirenography has been applied in the evaluation of kidney function and structure, frequently to exclude obstruction. However, in children and adults with a clinical picture of APN, diuretic MAG3 scintigraphy with zero time injection of furosemide (MAG3-F0) was observed to display focal parenchymal abnormalities; regional dysfunction (focal parenchymal decrease in early uptake; slow filling in and prolonged late retention of activity); or, less frequently, fixed defects.

CD009185,0,11744799,0,"Retrospective study of children with acute pyelonephritis. Evaluation of bacterial etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, drug management and imaging studies.","The purpose of the study was to investigate the management of pyelonephritis in a large Italian pediatric population. A total of 1,333 patients (36% male) were considered. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (89.9%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (3.6%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (2.1%). 27% of microorganisms were resistant to amoxicillin, 4% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 11% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 2.4% to gentamicin and less than 2% to ceftazidime. Despite this resistance pattern showing that oral antibiotics, such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, are effective in vitro as well as parenteral antimicrobials, a parenteral antibiotic was given initially to 756 (57.2%) children. A prophylactic regimen was started in 922 patients with a rate of reinfection during prophylaxis of 9.5%; a higher rate of reinfection was observed in patients with reflux (25%) compared to children without reflux (3%) (p < 0.0001). Vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 30% of patients. The number of renal abnormalities detected by DMSA in patients with and without reflux was significantly different (p < 0.001). CRP was higher in patients with scars (p < 0.02). In conclusion, pyelonephritis represents a common disease with about 2,500 days of hospitalization per year in the Veneto Region where there is a pediatric population of about 800,000 under 15 years of age. The results of antimicrobial in vitro tests indicate that amoxillicin/clavulanic acid could represent the antibiotic of choice. The high frequency of malformations, observed even in children between 6 and 12 years of age, may suggest the need of an imaging study including DMSA scan and VCUG in all age groups."
CD009185,0,1988517,0,Dependence among host response parameters used to diagnose urinary tract infection.,"The host-response parameters fever, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are activated in concert by cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Il-6 is secreted in response to Escherichia coli infection of the urinary tract. This study tested the hypothesis that the level of fever, CRP, and ESR is coregulated in individual patients. Body temperature, CRP, ESR, pyuria, and renal concentrating capacity were analyzed in 692 children with first-time urinary tract infections. The association of the parameters was evaluated by correlation and multiple regression analysis. The body temperature, CRP, and ESR were significantly correlated (r = .54, .58, and .58; P less than .001), and variation in CRP and ESR explained approximately 40% of the variation in fever. In contrast, the renal concentrating capacity and pyruia were weakly or not at all correlated with the febrile response (r = -.22; P less than .001), and less than 10% of the variation in renal concentrating capacity was explained by the other parameters. The results suggest that fever, CRP, and ESR describe the same aspect of the host response to UTI."
CD009185,0,9799067,0,15-year follow-up of reflux nephropathy by imaging.,"Reflux nephropathy i. e. renal scarring associated with vesico-ureteric reflux and urinary tract infection is primarily a diagnosis based on renal imaging. It is well known to be associated with hypertension and renal failure. This has led to regular long-term follow-up of patients, clinically and radiologically. We report the findings of renal imaging in a cohort of 37 patients with reflux nephropathy 15 or more years after successful surgical correction of vesico-ureteric reflux. The degree of renal scarring had been assessed and recorded at the beginning of the study utilizing a score on the original X-ray films. The scar scores of the current intravenous urography (IVU) imaging underestimate the degree of scarring in 35% of cases when compared with the previously recorded scar scores of the original IVU images suggesting a reduction in the renal scar score in some cases over the years. In the current review, concomitant renal images obtained by IVU and 99mTc dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) scanning were in agreement for scar scoring in only 50% of cases. The original scar score by IVU or the current scar score by either technique does not correlate with blood pressure, urine albumin excretion or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We conclude that serial long-term two-dimensional renal imaging in children with damaged kidneys who no longer have vesico-ureteric reflux, does not provide additional information that will alter clinical management. However, the changes in renal volume and echogenicity were not assessed in this study."

Infection was defined by Kass' criteria and APN was defined by the clinical findings. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) assay and postcontrast computed tomography in the presence of a doubt concerning the diagnosis. Escherichia coli (EC) was the bacterial species most frequently isolated (76%). A systematic search for fimbriae protein adhesins (group PAP: pyelonephritis associated pil) on the EC was performed by haemagglutination (human group A red blood cells). 64% of EC possessed fimbriae protein adhesions in the APN group versus only 20% in the LUTI group. In children in whom an organic abnormality was demonstrated, the incidence of fimbriae protein-positive EC was 33% while in children with no organic abnormality, particularly without reflux, 89% of EC presented fimbriae protein. A statistically significant difference was demonstrated between these two groups (p < 0.01). The results of this study illustrate the important role of these adhesins in the development of APN. These adhesins facilitate countercurrent ascension of bacteria in the ureter towards the upper urinary tract and can make the bacteria resistant to certain antibiotics. Testing for fimbriae protein can be useful in clinical practice when investigating the aetiology of APN in the absence of demonstrated reflux. A latex test should soon be available to facilitate the detection of fimbriae protein."

However, these markers are often increased in other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Procalcitonin (PCT), a precursor of calcitonin, was reported to be produced at the time of bacterial infection. The detection of PCT in blood is especially useful for the diagnosis of bacteremia. PCT is also considered to be useful for the diagnosis of limited bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and pyelonephritis, although the level in these conditions could be much less than that in bacteremia. There are two methods for the measurement of PCT in Japan: the chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) and immunochromatography assay (IC). CLEIA is quantitative and is sensitive for detecting a low level of PCT. IC is semi-quantitative and is useful for bed-side testing. It is important to understand the features of these two methods of PCT and to use them in appropriate situations."

Accurate determination of glomerular filtration rate can be obtained by means of an intravenous injection of Cr-51 EDTA and one or two blood samples. Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy is an accurate method for evaluation of regional cortical impairment during acute pyelonephritis and later on, for detection of permanent scarring. Tc-99m MAG3 renography is nowadays a well-standardized method for accurate estimation of the split renal function and of renal drainage with or without furosemide challenge. This technique is particularly indicated in uni- or bilateral uropathies with or without renal and/or ureteral dilatation.

During a 21-month prospective study 94 children (age range 2 weeks to 18.9 years) were hospitalized for febrile urinary tract infection. The male-to-female ratio for 35 patients less than 6 months old was 2.2:1. Of 59 patients older than 6 months the male-to-female ratio was reversed at 0.25:1 (p less than 0.001). In 13 of 24 infants (54%) less than 6 months old and in 8 of 12 boys (67%) older than 6 months a dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan documented acute parenchymal damage (p = 0.72). Vesicoureteral reflux or other genitourinary abnormalities were found in only 3 of 24 patients (12.5%) less than 6 months old compared with 6 of 12 boys (50%) older than 6 months (p = 0.036). Of 24 infants less than 6 months old 22 (92%) were uncircumcised compared with 6 of 12 boys (50%) older than 6 months (p = 0.009). We then retrospectively compared the circumcision status of the infants who had febrile urinary tract infection with a control group of 63 infants matched for age, race and socioeconomic status hospitalized with febrile upper respiratory infection during a similar period. The frequency of uncircumcised infants in the control group with febrile upper respiratory infection was only 44% (28 of 63) compared with 91% of infants with febrile urinary tract infection (p less than 0.001). Overall the findings of the male predominance among patients less than 6 months old with febrile urinary tract infection, the disproportionately high frequency of infants with febrile urinary tract infection who were not circumcised, and the disproportionately low occurrence of vesicoureteral reflux and other genitourinary abnormalities in infants with febrile urinary tract infection strongly support an association between circumcision status and the risk for febrile urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis in male infants."

The mean age, WBC counts, and ESR values were similar. Patients with UTI-associated otitis media had a higher incidence of hematuria. Prevalence of high (greater than or equal to 103 degrees F) fever was higher among the boys with UTI.

CD009185,0,7955834,0,Isotope renography in childhood enuresis.,"A retrospective review was performed of 100 enuretic children who underwent isotope renography during the period 1981-1989. Studies performed were Tc99mDMSA studies for renal size and to detect renal scarring and renography using Tc99mDTPA or MAG3 to evaluate excretion and detect vesicoureteric reflux. Fifty-five children had microbiological evidence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and 16 (29%) of these had abnormalities on their isotope studies. Forty-five had sterile urine and all had normal isotope studies. Thus despite recent reports of urodynamic abnormalities and increased incidence of reflux in patients with enuresis, our findings indicate that standard nuclear medicine renal studies show few abnormalities in patients with monosymptomatic enuresis. The 29% incidence of abnormal studies in patients with enuresis and UTIs suggests that the presence of infection should be an indication for further investigation in this subgroup of enuretic children."

CD009185,0,18800229,1,Urine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in children with urinary tract infection: a possible predictor of acute pyelonephritis.,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine expressed at sites of inflammation. We have assessed this factor (MIF) in urinary tract infections with the aim of determining a non-invasive and sensitive method to differentiate upper and lower renal involvement. Thirty-three pediatric patients with urinary track infection (25 with acute pyelonephritis, eight with acute cystitis) and 40 healthy subjects were recruited for this prospective case-control study. Pyelonephritis was differentiated from cystitis by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Urinary MIF concentration was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The urine MIF/creatinine (Cr) ratio was significantly higher in pyelonephritis patients than in those with acute cystitis and the control group (P < 0.001). The optimal cut-point of 4.90 pg/micromol Cr for the urine MIF/Cr ratio has the potential to be a biomarker for distinguishing patients with acute pyelonephritis from those with acute cystitis. Determination of the urinary MIF was also useful in selecting the patients at risk of permanent renal damage. Of those patients with pyelonephritis, based on the DMSA scan at the time of infection, scarring on follow-up DMSA scan 9-12 months later occurred in patients with the highest urinary MIF/Cr ratios. We conclude that the urine MIF/Cr ratio is a sensitive test for differentiating acute pyelonephritis from acute cystitis and also for detecting children with acute pyelonephritis who are at a higher risk for permanent renal scars in the future."

All children had a renal ultrasound, intravenous pyelogram and voiding cystogram performed 4 to 6 weeks after the infection. Eleven children with treatable problems were identified, 10 with vesicoureteral reflux and 1 with a ureterocele. For identification of treatable problems the predictive value of a positive test was: (1) fever, 10 of 24 (41.7%); (2) abnormal D-deaminoarginine vasopressin renal concentrating ability, 8 of 24 (33.3%); (3) serum C-reactive protein greater than or equal to 1.0, 8 of 25 (32.0%); (4) Elevated urine N-acetylglucosaminidase, 5 of 16 (31.2%); (5) erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than or equal to 25, 6 of 21 (28.6%); and (6) age less than 5 years, 10 of 43 (23.3%). Absence of fever denotes a low risk (less than 3%) of finding a treatable problem. Afebrile girls older than 5 years of age can have radiologic evaluation deferred until infection recurs. The presence of fever indicates a high risk of treatable urologic problems (41.7%) and warrants complete radiologic evaluation with the first urinary infection."

CD009185,0,12794259,0,SLE and infections.,"Infections are common in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and remain a source of mortality. The types of infections (such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, and sepsis) in SLE patients are similar to the general population and include the same pathogens (Gram-positive and Gram-negative). SLE patients may also develop opportunistic infections, especially when treated with immunosuppressive agents. As a high-risk population, identification and treatment of chronic infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are important prior to the institution of immunosuppression to prevent reactivation or exacerbation of the infection. A common caveat is to distinguish between a lupus flare and an acute infection; judicious use of corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs is critical in limiting infectious complications. The risk factors associated with susceptibility to disease include severe flares, active renal disease, treatment with moderate or high doses of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, and others. Genetic factors (complement deficiencies, mannose-binding lectin, Fcgamma III, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], osteopontin) may predispose certain SLE patients to develop infections. Parameters including C-reactive protein (CRP) and adhesion molecules may help to differentiate an infectious disease from an exacerbation of the disease. Finally, the mechanism of molecular mimicry by specific microbial agents may play a role in the induction of SLE."

CD009185,0,7787932,0,"Reflux nephropathy, urinary tract infection, and voiding disorders.","Urinary tract infection (UTI), vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and certain voiding disorders result in renal damage. In the past few years, the increasing use of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans, urodynamic testing, and antenatal sonography have helped shed light on the interrelationship of these disorders. Renal parenchymal involvement during acute febrile UTI and subsequent renal scarring are quite commonly observed in the absence of VUR, suggesting that the presence of reflux is not a prerequisite for renal damage. In infants with gross VUR, renal damage is often present at birth even before the development of any UTI. High intravesical pressures during bladder filling and voiding are commonly observed in infants with gross VUR, reflecting an underlying voiding dysfunction. High voiding detrusor pressures are also commonly observed in infants presenting with symptomatic UTI who do not have VUR. Children with dysfunctional voiding states are at risk for development of VUR and UTI. Renal damage in these children may occur in the absence of one or the other. This review elucidates how voiding dysfunction predisposes children to bacterial colonization of the bladder, the development or perpetuation of VUR, and renal damage."

Their serum and urine concentrations were measured in 27 neonates with urinary tract infection (UTI) at onset and the second week of therapy, as well as in 23 control neonates. Escherichia coli was isolated in 89% of cases. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scans were performed between the 10th and 90th days after UTI and showed pyelonephritic changes in 15 neonates (56%). Increased IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were found in urine but not in serum within the first 24 h after presumptive diagnosis of UTI (P=.036 and.010, respectively), suggesting that the neonatal urinary tract can respond to uropathogens by producing inflammatory cytokines. Urine concentrations of IL-6 correlated with findings of renal changes in 99mTc-DMSA scans (P=.012) and thus may serve as a marker of renal parenchymal outcome. All neonates exhibited undetectable urine cytokine levels during the second week of therapy."

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and radiological presentation of APN-upper urinary tract infection (UTI) cases observed between May 2005 and June 2006 and hospitalised in the Emergency Medicine ward of San Luigi Hospital, Orbassano, Turin, Italy. All patients underwent imaging scans and were differentiated on the basis of parenchymal involvement. Of around 45000 patient visits to the emergency room between May 2005 and June 2006, 23 patients were diagnosed as having uncomplicated upper UTI (all female, age 15-57 years). Renal parenchymal involvement was confirmed by imaging in 16 cases (69.6%). The imaging spectrum ranged from a small single lesion to large multiple defects; on admission, 2 cases had no pain and 2 had no fever; lower urinary tract symptoms were present in only 13 patients (7 with parenchymal involvement). All patients with parenchymal involvement had at least one sign of systemic inflammation-infection. Most patients (15) had taken antibiotics before hospitalisation; consequently, urine cultures were negative in 21 cases (14 cases with positive imaging (87.5%)). The data from patients with and without parenchymal involvement overlapped, the only difference being a higher prevalence of high CRP levels in cases with parenchymal involvement."
CD009185,0,9833368,0,The DMSA scan in paediatric urinary tract infection.,"The objective of the present paper was to review the use of the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan in urinary tract infection at British Columbia's Children's Hospital to determine the frequency of cortical defects and the association between vesico-ureteric reflux and the presence of cortical defects in children with urinary tract infection. A total of 129 consecutive children with a urinary tract infection referred for a DMSA scan in a 2-year period (January 1992-January 1994) were retrospectively studied. The results were analysed in terms of kidneys, and the incidence of cortical defects was determined. Eighty-eight patients (68%) had a radiographic micturating cysto-urethrogram within 6 months of the DMSA scan, and in this group the relationship of defects with vesico-ureteric reflux was determined. Overall, 81/258 (31%) of kidneys had a cortical defect on a DMSA scan. Of those who had a micturating cysto-urethrogram, 53/176 (30%) kidneys had vesico-ureteric reflux, and of those that had reflux, 21/53 (40%) had a cortical defect on a DMSA scan. In the group of children without reflux, 38/123 (31%) had a cortical defect. Renal cortical scan defects are common findings in paediatric urinary infection, and frequently occur in the absence of vesico-ureteric reflux. These defects represent either established scars or acute pyelonephritis that can proceed to scarring. The micturating cysto-urethrogram alone is insufficient as a screening modality to identify those kidneys at risk of renal scarring."
CD009185,0,8013196,0,Does routine ultrasound have a role in the investigation of children with urinary tract infection?,"The results of investigations in children with urinary tract infection (UTI) were studied in a district general hospital in order to assess the relative value of the two most widely used screening tests, namely ultrasound (US) and 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. A total of 193 children had undergone both US and DMSA scintigraphy as part of an investigation of proven single or multiple urinary tract infections over a 27 month period. DMSA scintigraphy revealed abnormalities in 22 of the children (11%). The abnormalities ranged from cortical defects to congenital anatomical abnormalities. US revealed abnormalities in six children (3%) but did not contribute any additional information in any. In our institution, the DMSA scintigram alone would have been an adequate screening test for children with UTI. Hydronephrosis is a common abnormality detected by US. Although none were seen in the study group, several children were examined during the study period with dilated collecting systems detected at ante-natal US. No cases of hydronephrosis presented as UTI. We question whether the use of routine US is justifiable in the investigation of children with UTI, and discuss whether a more selective investigation protocol should be adopted."

CD009185,0,10595891,0,The C-reactive protein.,"C-reactive protein (CRP) was identified in 1930 and was subsequently considered to be an ""acute phase protein,"" an early indicator of infectious or inflammatory conditions. Since its discovery, CRP has been studied as a screening device for inflammation, a marker for disease activity, and as a diagnostic adjunct. Improved methods of quantifying CRP have led to increased application to clinical medicine. In the emergency department (ED), CRP must be interpreted in the clinical context; no single value can be used to rule in or rule out a specific diagnosis. We conclude that CRP has limited utility in the ED. It may be a useful adjunct to serial examinations in equivocal presentations of appendicitis in those centers without ready access to computed tomography (CT) scan. It may be elevated with complications or treatment failures in patients with pneumonia, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and urinary tract infections. In patients with meningitis, neonatal sepsis, and occult bacteremia, CRP is usually elevated. However, CRP has no role in diagnosing these clinical entities, and a normal CRP level should never delay antibiotic coverage."

This study was undertaken to assess intra- and interobserver variability in the interpretation of DMSA renal scintigraphy using these criteria. Renal contours and parenchyma were assessed in three zones. Contours were assessed as normal or abnormal and parenchymal defects were evaluated in terms of character, shape and degree in three regions (upper and lower pole and midzone). Two nuclear medicine physicians blindly reviewed 57 DMSA scintigraphy on two occasions each. Disagreement of each observer's evaluation of the same scintigraphy on two different occasions was described as intraobserver variability, and the comparison between readings by each of the two observers was described as interobserver variability. High levels of intra- (95.9% and 90.6% respectively, p < 0.05) and interobserver agreement (84.4%, p < 0.05) were demonstrated. There were minor differences in inconsistencies between the two kidneys or different kidney zones. We conclude that standardization of criteria resulted in higher intra- and interobserver consistency in interpretation of DMSA scintigraphy."

RPI was evaluated by Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy within 7 days of admission. To establish cut-off points for ESR, CRP, and PCT, we used receiver operating characteristics curves and compared the area under the curve for ESR, CRP, and PCT. Twenty-seven children were diagnosed as having RPI based on positive renal scintigraphy. A body temperature of >38 degrees C, a history of diarrhea, and poor oral intake were more common in patients with RPI. ESR, CRP, and PCT, but not leukocyte count, were significantly higher in patients with RPI (P < 0.001). PCT was more sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of upper versus lower UTI than ESR and CRP. Using a cut-off value of 0.85 ng/ml, PCT had the best performance, with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 89%, 97%, 96%, and 91% respectively. Serum PCT is a better marker than ESR, CRP, and leukocyte count for the early prediction of RPI in children with a first episode of UTI."

Whole-body gallium-67 scintigraphy was performed to evaluate for occult infection. Tracer accumulated bilaterally in the kidneys consistent with the previously diagnosed pyelonephritis. Relatively intense uptake was also noted in the area of a known occipitoparietal infarct.

CD009185,0,15838697,0,Neonates with extra-renal pelvis: the first 2 years.,"Extra-renal pelvis (ERpel) is a common ultrasonographic finding among neonates who have undergone recurrent ultrasound examinations for a better definition of prenatal renal pelvic dilatation. This study tries to determine whether or not ERpel has important prognostic implications. Seventy-nine neonates (17 female) were examined. All had a diagnosis of prenatal renal pelvis dilatation, which was shown by postnatal ultrasound to be ERpel. Sixty ERpel neonates were examined 1.5 months to 2.5 months after the ultrasound (US) diagnosis by both Tc-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DPTA) dynamic renal scanning and (99m)Tc-pertechnetate direct cystography. Clinical assessment, urine cultures and renal ultrasound follow-up were maintained for 2 years. The proportion of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients with ERpel was compared with that of the total neonatal and infantile population with normal US scans in the region of our hospital. Associated minor congenital malformations were found in 12 of 79 neonates (15.2%). Four had a family history of ERpel. Among 60 neonates who underwent renal scanning, 36 (60%) were found to have urinary retention in the collecting system. Another nine (15%) had vesico-ureteral (VU) reflux, of which seven had urinary retention. Fifteen (25%) showed normal isotope imaging. Urinary tract infection was diagnosed in 16 ERpel neonates in whom only one exhibited VU reflux (grade 2). The incidence of neonatal UTI in the ERpel group was more than that of either neonatal or infantile UTI in those with normal US scans in the local population (20.2% vs 1.2% and 4.3%, respectively). Fifty-three infants completed a 2-year follow-up. Repeat renal ultrasonography indicated that one infant (1.8%) had developed bilateral hydronephrosis, 12 (22.6%) had unchanged findings, 18 (40%) showed an improvement (decrease of ERpel width or resolution in one side) and, in 22 (41.5%) infants, the condition had resolved. No clinical or kidney function deterioration was observed. Seven patients (13.2%) each had one episode of UTI during the 2-year follow-up period; none of them had VU reflux. Neonatal ERpel is more frequent in male infants. It is associated with greater rates of minor congenital malformations, VU reflux and UTI than in the general population of the same ages. The increased UTI incidence is not attributed to VU reflux."

CD009185,0,10394980,0,Rational diagnostic steps in acute pyelonephritis with special reference to ultrasonography and computed tomography scan.,"Depending on the severity of the clinical syndrome, acute pyelonephritis may require more extensive imaging diagnostics. In the uncomplicated form of the disease, ultrasonography does not appear to be absolutely necessary. In clinically severe cases, however, which fail to respond to antibiotic therapy, ultrasound is the optimal procedure for ruling out urinary tract obstruction. Where there is clinical suspicion of complications proven risk factors, persistent fever and/or continuing pathological inflammation parameters (elevated C-reactive protein levels in serum)-ultrasonography is the primary imaging technique for the exclusion of pyonephrosis, as well as for other complicating factors such as calculi, etc. In cases of insufficient response to antibiotic therapy, we recommend performing a renal computed tomography scan with contrast medium, in order to rule out hypoenhancing zones as hints for severe tissue alterations. This procedure is in accordance with the suggestions of the Society for Uroradiology. In the future, DMSA scintigraphy might constitute an equivalent diagnostic method for the exclusion of these focal inflammatory changes. Above all, DMSA scintigraphy makes it possible to anticipate the development of scars following acute pyelonephritis."
CD009185,0,17273861,1,Predictive value of clinical and laboratory variables for vesicoureteral reflux in children.,"We aimed to determine the predictability of clinical and laboratory variables for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children with urinary tract infection (UTI). Data of children with febrile UTI who underwent voiding cystoureterography between 2002 and 2005 were evaluated retrospectively for clinical (age, gender, fever > or = 38.5 degrees C, recurrent UTI), laboratory [leukocytosis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), pyuria, serum creatinine (S(Cr))] and imaging (renal ultrasonography) variables. Children with VUR (group 1) vs. no VUR (group 2) and children with high-grade (III-V) VUR (group 3) vs. no or low-grade (I-II) VUR (group 4) were compared. Among 88 patients (24 male), 38 had VUR and 21 high-grade VUR. Fever > or = 38.5 degrees C was associated with VUR [odds ratio (OR): 7.5]. CRP level of 50 mg/l was the best cut-off level for predicting high-grade VUR (OR 15.5; discriminative ability 0.89 +/- 0.05). Performing voiding cystourethrography based on this CRP level would result in failure to notice 9% of patients with high-grade VUR, whereas 69% of children with no/low-grade VUR would be spared from this invasive test. In conclusion, fever > or = 38 degrees C and CRP > 50 mg/l seem to be potentially useful clinical predictors of VUR and high-grade VUR, respectively, in pediatric patients with UTI. Further validation of these findings could limit unnecessary voiding cystourethrography."
CD009185,0,10394987,0,The influence of ofloxacin (Tarivid) on the parasite-host inter-relationship in patients with chronic urinary tract infection.,"In urinary tract infection (UTI), the aim of antimicrobial chemotherapy is either to attenuate the virulence of infective micro-organisms, to influence the interaction between germs and host or to kill bacteria. In 25 females (aged 49.8+/-14.7 years) with chronic UTI, parameters of inflammation (CRP, alpha 2-globulin, leukocytes, ESR) as well as renal function were analyzed under the treatment with ofloxacin 2 x 200 mg. Subsequently, bacterial attachment, bacterial count, leukocytes, antibody-coated bacteria (ACB), immunoglobulin (Ig) G, albumin, a2-microglobulin, Tamm Horsfall protein, secretory IgA (sIgA) and lysozyme were determined in urine. The micro-organisms were examined with regard to the expression of hemolysin, aerobactin, P-fimbriae and according to their plasmid profile. Ofloxacin serum levels were analyzed once prior to, on day 6 during and on day 3 after drug administration. In all cases, the acute clinical symptoms had disappeared after 10 days of treatment, all bacteria were eliminated, and the parameters of inflammation in serum and urine had returned to normal. On the sixth day of therapy, no expression of P-fimbriae was detectable in the Escherichia coli strains isolated, and the attachment rate decreased from 42+/-30.9% to 11.1+/-18.1%. The sIgA level rose from 42.6+68.5 prior to therapy to 88.8+/-136.8 mmol/l on day 3 after therapy; acute symptoms of UTI did not recur in any case during the period of 1 year."

She was admitted for severe back pain and high fever. Her white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) and endotoxin levels were elevated at 38,000/microl, 40.0 mg/dl, and 8,400 pg/ml, respectively. Her blood pressure was 80/34 mm Hg. Urinalysis revealed occult blood with innumerable WBCs. Plain abdominal radiography showed calcium stones in both kidneys. Septic shock with endotoxemia was diagnosed, and the patient was treated with antibiotics, gamma-globulin, and dopamine. However, her plasma endotoxin level remained high for 3 days. We performed direct hemoperfusion twice using a polymyxin B-immobilized fiber (PMX-F) column with a low priming volume. After PMX-F treatment, the patient's temperature decreased to 36.8 degrees C; her WBC count and CRP level decreased to 9,200/microl and 3.8 mg/dl, respectively. Her plasma endotoxin level decreased to 840 pg/ml after the first treatment and to 188 pg/ml after the second treatment. The next day, her blood endotoxin level further decreased to 32 pg/ml. Her blood pressure increased to 92/60 mm Hg after the first treatment and to 118/76 mm Hg after the second treatment. The patient was discharged on day 26 after admission.

Misdiagnosis may result in empirical treatment with antibiotics. The aim of this study was to determine whether initial treatment with antibiotics hindered subsequent diagnosis of appendicitis. Retrospective review of 311 children treated for appendicitis between 1999 and 2004. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1: (n = 45) received antibiotics prior to a definitive diagnosis of appendicitis. Group 2: (n = 266) did not receive antibiotics prior to a diagnosis of appendicitis. Group 1 patients were significantly younger and more likely to be female than in group 2. Abdominal tenderness was less marked and there was a greater reliance on radiological investigations in patients receiving antibiotics. C-reactive protein and pre-operative temperature were significantly higher in group 1 patients compared to group 2. The perforation rate and complication rate were significantly greater in group 1. The commonest misdiagnoses were urinary tract infection and respiratory infection. Initial misdiagnosis results in significant delay before appendicectomy. This study shows that the clinical signs of acute appendicitis can be masked by prior treatment with antibiotics. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis must be considered and, if necessary, excluded in all children seen with abdominal pain who have recently been treated with antibiotics."

The patient was well until March of 1979 when upon wakening up on one morning she noted slurring of her speech and weakness in her left upper and lower extremities. These symptoms cleared up during the next several months, however, she noted weakness in her left leg again in May 1985. In 1988, her posture became stooped and she walked in small steps. In 1990, she developed memory disturbance and difficulty in naming. In March 1993, she developed weakness in her right hand; she was treated with aspirin and amantadine HCl, however, she deteriorated during the next two week period, and was admitted to our hospital on March 27, 1993. On admission, she appeared alert, however, she could not answer verbally to questions; she could only utter unintelligible sounds. Apparently she was markedly demented. Her blood pressure was 170/98 mmHg, and general physical examination was unremarkable. Cranial nerves were grossly normal except for marked non-fluency in her word expression. She could not stand or walk, and apparently her right upper and lower extremities were paralyzed with some contracture. Deep reflexes were normally active without asymmetry. Chaddock sign was positive bilaterally. Sensory examination was difficult. Pertinent laboratory examination included WBC 13,000/microliters, BUN 152mg/dl, creatinine 3.75mg/dl, CRP 20.1mg/dl; a chest X-ray film revealed pneumonic shadow in the upper and the middle right lung fields. Cranial CT scan revealed multiple lacunar infarctions in both basal ganglia and cerebral white matters; periventricular lucency was also noted. She was treated with antibiotics and intravenous fluid. Acid-fast bacilli were recovered from sputum, and she was transferred to another hospital for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. After its treatment she returned to our hospital on July 8, 1993, when her condition was complicated with aspiration pneumonia. On admission, she was semicomatose, and no intelligible words were heard. Right facial paresis of the central type was noted. She was unable to stand or walk, and her right upper and lower extremities were paretic. Deep reflexes were increased with extensor toe sign on the right. She was treated with chemotherapy and intravenous fluid, however, her clinical course was complicated with respiratory as well as urinary tract infections. She developed cardiac as well as renal failure and expired on September 25, 1993.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD009185,0,12954160,0,Using Tc-99m DMSA renal cortex scan to detect renal damage in women with type 2 diabetes.,"Women with diabetes mellitus (DM) have urinary tract infection (UTI) more often than women without DM. It is unknown, however, what the prevalence and type of renal damage due to UTI is in these women. Therefore, in this study, we compared type 2 DM women with or without UTI history for the prevalence and type of renal damage by technetium-99m dimercapto-succinic acid (Tc-99m DMSA) renal scan. A total of 128 type 2 DM women with or without UTI history received Tc-99m DMSA renal scan were included in this study. The patients were separated into three groups: (1) 43 patients without UTI history, (2) 42 patients with only lower UTI (cystitis) history and (3) 43 patients with upper UTI (pyelonephritis) history. The renal scan findings were separated into three types: (A) normal, (B) inflammation and (C) scar. The 31.9% (50/128) of type 2 DM patients had renal damages. Group 1 patients had a significantly lower prevalence of renal damages including inflammation and scar as compared to Groups 2 and 3 patients. In addition, the prevalence of renal damage was significantly higher in Group 3 than in Group 2 patients. Renal scars only were visualized in Group 3 patients. However, other clinical data were not statistically different among the three group patients. Type 2 DM women with UTI history, especially if they had upper UTI have a significantly higher prevalence of renal damage than in those without UTI."
CD009185,0,17544626,0,Renal infection and vesico-ureteric reflux.,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease of childhood. The investigation of UTI in children has been the subject of debate and controversy for many years. Most workers agree that the first imaging modality to be used should be an ultrasound examination to exclude obstruction, structural abnormalities, and renal calculi. The role of (99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is becoming increasingly important. Many argue that if the DMSA study is normal at the time of acute UTI, no further investigation is required because the kidneys have not been involved and thus there will be no late sequelae. Others use the acute DMSA study to determine the intensity of antibiotic therapy. The importance of the role of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) is being debated. Some workers will only proceed to cystography to detect VUR if the DMSA study is abnormal, whereas others advocate a more aggressive approach. VUR can be identified by a variety of radiological and scintigraphic techniques. Although the radiological cystogram is the gold standard and is essential in the first UTI in a male patient, to exclude the presence of posterior urethral valves, radionuclide cystograms are advantageous in other situations. Suprapubic cystography techniques have been described to overcome the trauma of urethral catheterization but have not been widely accepted."

We report on a 7-year-old child who presented with severe UTI. The early (day 4) renal computed tomography (CT) scan showed normal-sized kidneys (110 mm on the left, 105 mm on the right), whereas the control CT scan and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, performed 1 and 2 months later, respectively, showed a small scarred right kidney (60 mm) with a 12% residual function. An intermittent right vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was diagnosed by direct isotopic cystography and then treated by Cohen vesicoureteral reimplantation. The patient remained free of infectious recurrence, hypertension, or renal function decrease. This report demonstrates that one episode of acute pyelonephritis can lead to severe renal scarring. Whereas antenatal lesions are thought to have a stronger role in the causal pathway for reflux nephropathy than is UTI in addition to VUR, this observation reminds us that UTI can truly play an important role in damaging kidneys."

CD009185,0,10815457,0,[Investigation of the urinary tract in children in nuclear medicine].,"The early detection of urologic abnormalities by antenatal sonography has resulted in the investigation of many infants and neonates for suspicion of either obstructive uropathy or reflux nephropathy. Nuclear medicine techniques allow to assess renal parenchyma integrity, to detect pyelonephritic scars and to measure absolute and relative renal function; these methods are easy to perform and reproducible, without any sedation, repeated venous punctures or bladder catheterization. Furthermore, the use of dynamic tubular tracers and frusemide test is a very usefull method which can differentiate between upper and/or lower urinary tract obstruction and determine the degree of obstruction (severe or incomplete) in order to plan for surgery or conservative treatment. The detection of vesicoureteric reflux may be difficult as it is an intermittent phenomenon: the use of the indirect radionuclide cystography (IRC), that is to say after completion of a dynamic renography, allows to detect reflux with a high sensitivity because images can be recorded continuously until the child voids, without any bladder catheterization and at low radiation dosis. In case of discordant results between micturating cysto-urethrography and IRC or of concomittant obstructive uropathy, the direct radionuclide cystography (DRC) is indicated for appropriate treatment. Nuclear medicine techniques do not give morphological information about the urinary tract and should be considered as complementary to radiological investigations in first evaluation of children with recurrent urinary tract infections or hydronephrosis."
CD009185,0,11261676,0,Attitude of Belgian pediatricians toward strategy in acute pyelonephritis.,"To investigate the attitude of Belgian pediatricians toward the management and treatment of children with suspected acute pyelonephritis, a short letter was sent to all Belgian pediatricians (1,200). It contained a brief description of a clinical case strongly suggestive of acute pyelonephritis followed by a series of questions centered on complementary examinations to be performed, need of hospitalization and treatment. A total of 583 responses were received (49%). In the acute phase, 99% of pediatricians perform urine cultures, 87% blood examinations, and 76% renal ultrasound. Dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) scintigraphy is performed during the acute phase by 37% and during follow-up by 32% of all pediatricians. A voiding cystogram is requested by 71%. Ambulatory treatment is considered by 30% of responders. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (44%) and trimethoprim/sulfonamide (22%) are the most frequently used oral antibiotics. Private pediatricians perform fewer examinations and more frequently consider ambulatory treatment of acute pyelonephritis, compared to pediatricians working in hospitals. Among Belgian pediatricians, attitudes toward the diagnosis and treatment of acute pyelonephritis are heterogeneous. This survey underlines the need for properly documented prospective studies for the evaluation of different treatment modalities in childhood acute pyelonephritis."
CD009185,0,8988117,1,Are younger children at highest risk of renal sequelae after pyelonephritis?,The general belief about the relation between risk of renal sequelae after pyelonephritis and age is that infants are at highest risk and children older than 5 years at lower risk.

CD009185,0,2849381,0,99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan in patients with established radiological renal scarring.,"The findings on 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans were examined in 54 patients aged 3 to 33 years in whom renal scarring had been diagnosed radiologically in childhood after urinary tract infection. There was no recent history of infection. Vesicoureteric reflux had been present in 48 patients and had stopped in 23 at the time of the DMSA scan. In six of the 72 radiologically scarred kidneys, the DMSA scan appeared normal but scarring would have been overlooked in only two of the 54 patients. DMSA scan changes are non-specific and underestimated individual scars in 21 kidneys. The intravenous urogram and the DMSA scan showed good correlation but should be regarded as complementary investigations in these patients, giving morphological and functional information, respectively. On DMSA scans the timing of any preceding urinary tract infection must be considered in order to differentiate diffuse potentially reversible defects in isotope uptake after urinary tract infection from those due to permanent renal scarring."
CD009185,0,17211588,0,Lack of association of IL8 gene polymorphisms with familial vesico-ureteral reflux.,"Vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common inherited disorder of the lower urinary tract. Children with VUR are at risk for ongoing renal damage with subsequent infections. IL8 is an important inflammatory mediator which can be produced by epithelial cells of the renal tract in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli. High serum concentrations of IL-8 have been reported in patients with chronic renal failure. Elevated IL-8 levels have been reported in the urine of patients with VUR and renal parenchymal scarring (RPS). More recently it was reported that urine IL-8 levels remain elevated in infants with VUR even in the absence of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Increased IL-8 expression has been shown to be associated with polymorphism at position -251 (rs4073) of the IL-8 promoter. The aim of this study was to examine the association of IL-8 gene polymorphism with familial VUR in a cohort of 219 siblings from 109 families affected with VUR, the largest such cohort tested to date. RPS was assessed using dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. Genotyping was performed in 219 siblings with VUR (157 without RPS, 62 with RPS) and 292 controls for the position -251 of IL-8 gene by polymerase chain reaction with tetra primers and gel analysis. Genotype was compared using the chi square test. Statistical significance was taken as a value of P < 0.05. There were no significant differences in IL-8 -251 genotype frequency between VUR patients and controls. Similarly, gender, severity of VUR and renal parenchymal scarring had no effect on IL-8 -251 genotype frequency. Although IL-8 urinary levels have been reported to be elevated in VUR, our data indicate that IL-8 gene is not involved in the pathogenesis of familial VUR or reflux nephropathy."

Renal cortical defects were detected in 65 kidneys by DMSA scan, intravenous urogram, and ultrasound scan combined; 62 (95%) being seen on DMSA scan. The finding of reflux on micturating cystourethrography showed a highly significant correlation with renal defects seen on DMSA scanning, a less close but still significant correlation with abnormalities on intravenous urography, but none with ultrasound scan findings. The sensitivity of the DMSA scan in screening for all grades of reflux is estimated as 0.66, which is higher than that previously reported for the intravenous urogram or ultrasound scan. DMSA scans were less likely to miss grade 3 reflux than the other two methods. DMSA scans are more useful than other upper renal tract imaging techniques in detecting renal defects. Consideration should be given to their use as a first investigation in place of routine intravenous urograms. Ultrasound scans alone will overlook potentially serious urinary tract abnormalities."

Normally, the postnatal urachus presents as a fibrous band extending from the bladder to the umbilicus. Urachal cysts may occur in postnatal life. Spontaneous perforation of urachal cysts is a very rare condition, which clinically may not be distinguishable from other acute abdominal conditions. We report a case of a 63-year-old male with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and a bladder rupture caused by a spontaneous perforation of an infected urachal cyst. The symptomatology showed abdominal rigidity and pain, a palpable mass in the lower abdomen, and hematuria. Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis and an increased CRP level. The bladder rupture was confirmed by cystography. Bacteriologic examination identified Proteus vulgaris, Corynebacterium species, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most of the published cases in the literature report about intraperitoneal perforation of infected urachal cysts.

Most of the small refluxes were missed, but so too were 50% of the major refluxes. Taking as the reference 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, MCUG detected 91% of the patients with DMSA abnormalities on at least one kidney, DRC detected 95%, and IRC detected 46% and 43% respectively, in groups I and II.

We used isotopic cystography (IC) for diagnosis of VUR in children with febrile UTI. Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy was performed 6 months after cure of the last UTI. Renal defects were defined by the finding of focal defects of radionuclide uptake and/or by a split renal function <43%. The study included 206 children with primary VUR and 77 without VUR.

This study aimed to determine 1) the incidence of cortical scarring in Thai children presenting with upper urinary tract infection, 2) the association between VUR with acute pyelonephritis and subsequent renal scarring, 3) the use of DMSA and direct radionuclide cystography (DRNC) scintigraphy in children with UTI. Sixty newly diagnosed UTI children underwent DRNC and Tc-99m DMSA renal cortical scintigraphy at the time of first UTI diagnosis and 6 months later. There were no significant differences of age, sex, type of antiobiotics and pathogens (E. coli vs non-E. coli) between those who did and did not develop scars (p>0.05). 58/98 of 1st DMSA abnormal kidneys (59.18%) developed scars. 60.20 per cent of 98 positive 1st DMSA had VUR while 80.33 per cent of 61 with VUR had positive 1st DMSA. 59.02 per cent of these 61 kidneys developed scars. Scar occurrence were 18.7 times in high grade VUR compared to low grades. In conclusion, there was a high incidence of acute pyelonephritis in the presence of VUR but acute pyelonephritis does not necessarily need VUR for its development. High grade reflux with upper UTI, is a strong indicator for renal scarring. Children presenting with UTI, irrespective of age, sex, or pathogen, should have both DMSA and DRNC scintigraphy performed to identify upper UTI and high risk patients who will develop subsequent renal scarring."

CD009185,0,1589729,1,Blood group non-secretors have an increased inflammatory response to urinary tract infection.,"The aim of this study was to assess the possible relationship between secretor state and the inflammatory response to urinary tract infection (UTI). Girls with recurrent UTI were prospectively studied. They included 61 secretor and 23 non-secretor individuals with 604 episodes of recurrent UTI. The response to each UTI episode was measured as the levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the body temperature as well as renal concentrating capacity and pyuria. The levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the body temperature were significantly higher in non-secretors than in secretors (p less than 0.04). As a consequence, non-secretors had an increased probability of being assigned a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis rather than asymptomatic bacteriuria (p less than 0.05). The higher inflammatory response in non-secretors was independent of the Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta adhesin expression of the infecting Escherichia coli strains. The increased inflammatory response to UTI in non-secretors might explain the accumulation of these individuals among patients with renal scarring."
CD009185,0,6376860,0,[Clinical evaluation of ceftazidime in paediatrics].,"Ceftazidime ( CAZ ), a new injectable cephem antibiotic, was used for treatment of infections in children, and the following results were obtained. After an intravenous injection of CAZ at a dose of 20 mg/kg, the mean blood levels in 2 patients were 41.5 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 18.1 micrograms/ml at 2 hours and 2.55 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life (T 1/2) of 1.37 hours. In a 22-day-old baby with meningitis given CAZ intravenously at a dose of 43.5 mg/kg, the blood levels were 100 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 68 micrograms/ml at 2 hours and 25 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life (T 1/2) of 2.96 hours. After intravenous administration of CAZ in doses ranging from 35.7 to 50 mg/kg, CSF concentrations ranged from N.D. to 6.3 micrograms/ml in 3 patients with purulent meningitis, although 19 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 13 micrograms/ml at 2 hours in 1 patient after intravenous administration of 46.7 mg/kg. In patient with mumps meningitis, CSF concentrations were undetectable after intravenous administration of 35.7 mg/kg. Seventeen patients (each 1 patient with lymphadenitis, tonsillitis and septicemia, each 2 patients with pneumonia, bronchiectatic bronchitis, pyothorax and purulent meningitis, each 3 patients with pyelonephritis and enteritis) were treated with CAZ intravenously, at the daily doses of 178.2 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg in 4 divided doses in patients with meningitis and 44.1 to 103.4 mg/kg in 3 divided doses in patients with other infections (two of them were given by intravenous drip infusion for 30 minutes). The clinical responses were excellent or good in all the patients except for 1 case of Salmonella enteritis (poor) and 1 case of Campylobacter enteritis (poor). The efficacy rate was 88.2%. It was noteworthy that the clinical response was excellent in 1 case of septicemia with P. aeruginosa with leukemic stage of malignant lymphoma and in 2 cases of purulent meningitis. As side effects, fever, eruption, leukocytopenia, elevation in GOT and positive CRP considered to be allergic, were observed on day 16 of administration in 1 case of pyothorax. These symptoms disappeared by discontinuance of administration. In addition, there were elevation in GOT and GPT in 2 cases and elevation in GOT in 2 cases and elevation in GPT in 1 case; they were all mild or transient, and there was nothing to be worried about.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Abnormal DMSA renal scans were found in 207 kidneys (207/494, 41.9%) and in 163 cases (163/247, 66%). The appearance of an abnormal DMSA renal scan is correlated with fever and vesicoureteral reflux, but not with age or sex. Because the prevalence of upper UTI in children is high, DMSA renal scan is undoubtedly a valuable tool for pediatricians as a guide in giving appropriate antibiotic therapy and to prevent further renal damage."

Results of a coordinated research project.","Acute pyelonephritis (APN) may produce permanent renal damage (PRD), which can subsequently lead to diverse complications. We prospectively evaluated 147 females and 122 males (mean age 3.5 years) with APN in order to analyze the relationship between the presence of PRD, at the time of cortical renal scintigraphy, and age, gender, episodes of urinary tract infection (UTI), and presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). There were 152 children studied after the first proven UTI. VUR was present in 150 children. PRD was observed in 170 children. There were no significant differences between boys and girls. PRD was found in 36.4% of children younger than 1 year and in 70.1% of those older than 1 year ( P<0.0001). Of children with VUR, 72% had PRD compared with 52% of children without VUR ( P<0.0001). Of children with a first episode of UTI, 55.9% developed PRD as did 72.6% of those with recurrent UTI ( P=0.004). Our results showed that PRD in children with APN is important, especially in the presence of VUR, recurrent UTI, and older age."
CD009185,0,11511988,1,Acute renal cortical scintigraphy in children with a first urinary tract infection.,"This prospective study, performed in 101 children with a first symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), evaluates the diagnostic value of clinical, biological, and ultrasound parameters in detecting children with acute renal infection documented by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. In children with a positive DMSA scan, mean C-reactive protein (CRP) was higher than in children with a normal DMSA scan (114+/-64 vs. 67+/-38 mg/dl, mean+/-SD, P=0.0002). The sensitivity and specificity of CRP was 64% and 68%, respectively. In children with severe kidney involvement, mean CRP and white blood count (WBC) were higher than in children with mild/moderate disease (151+/-83 vs. 92+/-55 mg/dl for CRP, P=0.0149; 20,100+/-6,854 vs. 15,023+/-6,145 WBC/ mm3 for WBC, P=0.0131). The sensitivity and specificity was 85% and 20% for CRP, and 77% and 18% for WBC, respectively. One or more areas of abnormal cortical echogenicity were documented in 3% of kidneys with positive DMSA scans. Dilatation of the collecting system was observed in 24% of kidneys. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography was 27% and 89%, respectively. In conclusion, clinical, biological, and ultrasound parameters do not accurately distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis in children with UTI and do not identify children with severe renal damage. Accordingly, we recommend that DMSA scan should be added to the initial work-up of children with UTI."

CD009185,0,12595511,0,Primary vesicoureteric reflux as a predictor of renal damage in children hospitalized with urinary tract infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Renal parenchymal disease after urinary tract infection (UTI) has been associated with the development of hypertension and renal functional impairment. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed to determine how effectively the finding of primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) on micturating cystography (MCU) in children hospitalized with UTI predicted renal parenchymal disease on (99m)Technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy. Medline, Embase, and PubMed were use to find reports with original data for children hospitalized with bacteriologically-proven UTI who had undergone both MCU and (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy, and which also reported both positive and negative results of these tests. A meta-analysis of likelihood ratios positive and negative for MCU was then performed, including tests for heterogeneity. Twelve valid studies were found, seven with data for 537 children, with a positive (99m)Tc-DMSA scan prevalence of 59% overall, and seven studies with data for 1062 kidneys, with a positive (99m)Tc-DMSA scan prevalence of 36%. The likelihood ratio positive for MCU was 1.96 (95% CI, 1.51 to 2.54) for children, and 2.34 (1.53 to 3.57) for kidneys. The likelihood ratio negative was 0.71 (0.58 to 0.85) for children and 0.72 (0.61 to 0.86) for kidneys. There was evidence of heterogeneity. The meta-analysis showed that a positive MCU increases the risk of renal damage in hospitalized UTI patients by about 20%, whereas a negative MCU increases the chance of no renal involvement by just 8%. VUR is hence a weak predictor of renal damage in pediatric patients hospitalized with UTI. Physicians should be aware of the limitations of using MCU-detected primary VUR as an effective screening test for renal damage in this population. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of renal damage in such patients is probably complex because it is often detected without demonstrable VUR."

It is active against virtually all common urinary pathogens, is well absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, is well tolerated and safe. The Authors have carried out a clinical trial of the prophylactic use of cefaclor in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in children. We studied 52 children (25 females and 27 males, median age 7 +/- 19 months) with UTI, investigated by imaging (sonography, micturating cystourethrography, renal scintigraphy) and by urodynamic studies. We found vesicoureteral reflux in 37 cases, primitive megaureter in 6 cases, in 1 patient duplication of the collecting system in 1 patient and substenosis of ureteropelvic junction in 1 case. In the others 5 cases the UTI were associated with bladder disfunction and finally in 1 case the UTI occurred in absence of urinary malformations. All patients received cefaclor, as prophylaxis, at the dosage of 10-20 mg/kg/die, administrated as a single bedtime dose. The mean time of treatment with cefaclor was 8 +/- 3,48 months. We observed an optimal compliance in all patients, also in the first year of life. In only two out of 52 patients, during the prophylaxis, we found documented bacteriuria. We stopped treatment in two cases because of an adverse effect (in both children has been demonstrated a cutaneous rash). In conclusion our study shows that cefaclor is an effective, well tolerated and safe agent in the UTI prophylaxis, also in the first year of life, when it seems to offer an optime alternative to other agents."

A mixed bacterial and viral infection was documented in 19 patients (37%). Seven patients (14%) showed a diagnostic rise in antibodies to H. influenzae and 8 patients (16%) showed an antibody elevation to B. catarrhalis in their paired sera; pneumococcal antigen was detected in acute phase serum from 4 patients (8%). The rate of mixed infections in patients having respiratory symptoms was 52%. High serum C-reactive protein values and white blood cell counts were found significantly more often in those with mixed infections than in those who had viral infections. The results indicate that mixed bacterial and viral infections occur more frequently in children than one could anticipate on the basis of the earlier reports. Mixed bacterial and viral etiology is highly probable in a child who has a defined viral infection with high C-reactive protein and white blood cell count values, especially in the presence of respiratory symptoms."

The tumor was examined by 99mTc colloid radionuclide scan, compound ultrasonography and angiography. Ultrasonography demonstrated a large, solid tumor (5 x 5 x 8 cm) in the right lobe of the liver which had an echogenic central core surrounded by an area giving low-amplitude echoes. Angiography disclosed that the tumor was well demarcated and hypervascular, containing large tortuous arteries. The uptake of radionuclide in the tumor was normal. The tumor was resected and the pathological findings were typical for focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) of the liver. The combination of the findings of these three diagnostic imaging methods is probably specific for uncomplicated FNH, a benign and innocuous tumor of the liver."
CD009185,0,19444481,0,Imaging studies for first urinary tract infection in infants less than 6 months old: can they be more selective?,"This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the selective approach of imaging infants < 6 months old with urinary tract infection (UTI) according to the UTI guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 2007. Infants < 6 months old with their first UTI from January 2001 to December 2006 having undergone an ultrasound examination of the urinary tract, a micturating cystourethrogram, and a late di-mercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, were included. Their condition was evaluated against a set of risk features according to the UTI guidelines. Those having any one of these were classified as atypical and those having none as typical. There were 134 infants reviewed, with a typical (98 infants) to atypical (36 infants) ratio of 2.7 to 1. Girls were found to be relatively more represented in the atypical group [male (M):female (F) = 1.3:1] than in the typical group (M:F = 4.4:1) (P < 0.004). There were significantly more infants with abnormal micturating voiding cystourethrograms (MCUGs) (P = 0.007), more refluxing ureters (P < 0.001) and more significant vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) (>/= grade III) (P = 0.013) in the atypical group than in the typical group; while there was no significant difference in ultrasound (US) and DMSA scan findings between the two groups. In the atypical group there was no difference in imaging studies (and, thus, the results) between the conventional practice and the NICE UTI recommendation. In the typical group, if the recommendations of the guidelines had been followed (i.e. only those with abnormal US would have been further investigated), 25 refluxing ureters and 22 scarred kidneys would have been left undiagnosed. In conclusion, application of the suggested selective imaging approach would leave a significant number of VUR and renal scars undiagnosed, and it may not be an optimal practice for infants less than 6 months old with their first UTI. The best approach remains to be clarified."
CD009185,0,7774071,0,A prospective study of cortical scarring in acute febrile pyelonephritis in adults: clinical and bacteriological characteristics.,"Previous reports have demonstrated lesions on computerized axial tomography (CT), and nuclear scintigraphy (DMSA) in acute pyelonephritis (PN). We undertook a prospective study of all patients presenting to our hospital with PN over 40 months. Patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria, were treated with intravenous antibiotics. Excluding two who were pregnant, all patients had imaging by intravenous urography (IVU), CT and DMSA during their admission. Urine samples were collected prior to treatment. Patients without IVU evidence of cortical scarring but with parenchymal defects on CT and/or DMSA underwent a repeat DMSA three or more months after the acute episode. Of the 164 patients, 142 were female. E. coli was found in 116 patients. Forty-six patients had an abnormality on IVU. Of the 106 patients without IVU evidence of cortical scarring, 59 had a defect on CT and/or DMSA. Late DMSA scans in 35 of these 59 patients showed a persistent abnormality in 77%. E. coli characteristics such as P-fimbriae and Type 1 fimbriae were not predictive of acute imaging abnormalities. Inhibition of E. coli growth by the addition of EDTA was highly predictive of acute CT and DMSA abnormalities with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 82.8%. Acute pyelonephritis is often associated with acute CT and/or DMSA abnormalities which may evolve into renal cortical scars. Acute scan abnormalities can be predicted by the presence of E. coli which were susceptible to EDTA in culture. Late scarring could not be predicted by clinical features, response to treatment or antibiotic used."
CD009185,0,12696269,0,The role of nuclear medicine in evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux and/or reflux nephropathy.,"Early identification of different categories of the risk of scarring in children with first (or follow up) urinary tract infection and/or early detection and treatment of vesicoureteral reflux are important to prevent kidney impairment. The demonstration and grading of reflux is crucial in examination and follow up of any child with urinary tract infection. Nephro-urologic radionuclide studies are able to detect vesicoureteral reflux and reflux nephropathy, such as radionuclide cystography--RNC--(both direct radionuclide voiding cystography--DRVC--and indirect radionuclide cystography-IRC), renal DMSA scintigraphy, MAG3 renal diuresis scintigraphy and DTPA renal diuresis scintigraphy. They allow to assess renal parenchyma integrity, to detect pyelonephritic scars, to evaluate the different aspects of urinary tract function and to measure absolute and relative function after intravenous injection of radiopharmaceuticals. The procedure, image acquisition and processing and the diagnostic relevance of all aforesaid nephro-urologic radionuclide studies are illustrated."

CD009185,0,9926301,0,Interest of direct radionuclide cystography in repeated urinary tract infection exploration in childhood.,"108 children with repeated urinary tract infection were examined both with direct contrast cystography and radionuclide cystography. There was a good correlation between the two procedures in the majority of the cases (79), but in 21 cases, direct radionuclide cystography alone was positive and for 8 other children, direct contrast cystography showed a low-grade vesico-ureteric reflux even though radionuclide cystography was negative. When comparing the two procedures and taking into consideration the age of the patients we find that radionuclide cystography is more sensitive to detect vesico-ureteric reflux in the younger population (p < 0.02). This advantage is less clear for older children who more often present a low-grade reflux. Low radiation exposure is also a great advantage of radionuclide cystography, but anatomic definition is better with contrast cystography. It seems thus that the two procedures complement rather than rival each other. Their respective interest for evaluation of repeated urinary tract infection in children therefore depends on age, attain-ability of the procedure, and the possibility of a bladder or ureteral abnormality. Quite a few authors consider radionuclide cystography as at least as valid as contrast cystography, and even more sensitive. We have attempted to compare both procedures and to determine their respective role in repeated urinary tract infection exploration."

In this study, the two techniques were performed simultaneously on a group of 64 children referred for the evaluation of VUR. DRVC detected VUR in 54/128 ureterorenal units, and VUS confirmed reflux in 44 (81%). Only in two cases was the reflux not confirmed by DRVC (97% specificity). Ten units with minimal grade I VUR detected by DRVC were not identified by VUS. For identification of grade II and III reflux, sensitivity of VUS reached 100%. Ten units with grade I VUR at DRVC presented grade II at VUS. Eleven units with grade II VUR at DRVC presented grade III at VUS. In conclusion, contrast-enhanced VUS is a useful diagnostic tool for the detection of VUR in children. Our data suggest a higher diagnostic accuracy of urosonography compared to radionuclide cystography in the determination of the grade of VUR; this may have significant consequences on the management of young patients affected by VUR."

Eighty-two Kuwaiti Arab children (10 males and 72 females) who had abnormal (99m)Tc DMSA renal scan findings of acute pyelonephritis were prospectively studied with the same imaging modality 6 months after treatment to identify those who developed renal scarring. A micturition cystourethrogram (MCUG) was performed for all of the children 1 month after diagnosis. Children were divided into 3 age groups (<2 years, 2-5 years and above 5 years). The follow-up DMSA renal scans 6 months after diagnosis revealed normalization of renal changes in 56% (46 patients), much improvement with residual renal abnormality in 6% (5 patients), and persistent parenchymal defects in 38% (31 patients). Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was found in 32% of children (26/82) and the majority were between grade I and III. Thirteen of those with VUR (50%) developed renal scars on follow-up. Fifty-three percent of the scarred kidneys (19/36) were drained by non-refluxing ureters. In this study, children older than 2 years had less VUR yet were more susceptible to APN and to the development of renal scars. Girls were more prone to developing APN and renal scarring than boys.

Excretion urography has a sensitivity of 0.86 and a specificity of 0.92 in the detection of pyelonephritic scarring in children. Radioisotope scintigraphy has a sensitivity of 0.96 and a specificity of 0.98. It is therefore concluded that radioisotope scintigraphy is the preferred technique."

CD009185,0,3745475,0,Serial concentrations of C-reactive protein as an indicator of urinary tract infection in patients with spinal injury.,"C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured serially in 16 patients with an acute spinal injury. Twelve episodes of acute urinary tract infection (UTI) occurred during the study period. These were all associated with an increased concentration of CRP greater than 50 mg/l, which returned to normal after successful treatment. Thirteen episodes of asymptomatic bacteriuria associated with increased concentrations of CRP greater than 20 mg/l occurred, indicating tissue damage. More commonly, significant bacteriuria was associated with normal concentrations of CRP, and presumably, simple colonisation of the urinary tract, which, we suggest, does not require treatment with antibiotics. Serial measurement of CRP in patients with spinal injury may help distinguish between urinary tract colonisation and infection and be useful in monitoring the response to the treatment of clinical UTI."

Almost all patients complained of loin pain and 48% had lower urinary tract symptoms. In 58% of cases a renal mass was palpable. An anaemia, pyuria and elevated blood sedimentation rate were usual. Plain films of the abdomen revealed enlargement of the outline of the involved kidney in 75%, ipsilateral absence of the psoas shadow in 63% and urinary tract calculi in 60%. At high-dose excretion urography a nephrogram was obtained in 58% of cases and a pyelogram produced in 34%. No single clinical or radiological entity emerged, there being an unbroken spectrum of disease ranging from infected hydronephrosis to xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. There is an increasing incidence of calculi, loss of the renal and psoas outlines and reduced renal function with increasing chronicity of disease. High-dose excretion urography is the investigation of choice since not only may the diagnosis be established but also there precise pathological state of the involved kidney. Further radiological investigation is infrequently required."
CD009185,0,1810092,0,"Bacterial attachment, inflammation and renal scarring in urinary tract infection.","E. coli cause greater than 90% of urinary tract infections (UTI) in childhood. The capacity to adhere to urinary tract epithelial cells characterizes E. coli strains that cause acute pyelonephritis. Galactose alpha 1-4Galactose beta is the minimal receptor for adhering uropathogenic E. coli. Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta-binding bacteria caused significantly higher body temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), pyuria, and lower renal concentrating capacity than E. coli lacking this specificity. The binding bacteria thus appeared to be more potent inducers of acute inflammation. Since inflammation may lead to tissue damage, we examined the relationship of infection with Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta-positive bacteria to renal scarring. The frequency of renal scarring was 5% in boys with Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta-positive and 40% in boys with Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta-negative E. coli. Analysis of binding capacity with the help of a newly developed latex agglutination assay can thus be used as an effective predictor of risk for renal scarring."

Episodes of bacteriuria in 1473 children were followed prospectively from 1970 to 1984. To study the inflammatory response to the bacteriuric epidoses, we recorded body temperature, C-reactive protein, microsedimentation rate, urinary leukocyte count, and renal concentrating capacity. Bacterial isolates from each episode were identified and saved, and the adhesive capacity of 2669 E. coli strains was defined by their binding to galactose alpha 1----4galactose beta-containing receptors. Inflammatory response was significantly higher and renal concentrating capacity significantly lower during episodes caused by attaching strains. There was a linear relation between the number of indicators of inflammation and the proportion of galactose alpha 1----4galactose beta-binding strains present. Vesicoureteric reflux potentiated the inflammatory response. Attaching strains of E. coli thus appeared to be more capable of causing inflammation than were other bacteria. The potentiating effect of attachment on inflammation explains the over-representation of galactose alpha 1----4galactose beta-recognizing bacteria in patients with acute pyelonephritis."

All patients presented with urinary tract infections and voiding disfunction symptoms. 5 children had vesicoureteral reflux on voiding cystography and 10 patients had established scars on DMSA scan at initial presentation. Urodynamic study showed constriction of the urinary sphincter during voiding and increase of post-voiding residual urine volume in all children, with bladder instability 20 (80%). Treatment consisted of voiding reeducation, anticholinergics, antibiotic prophylaxis and muscle relaxants. The mean of follow-up was 22 months.

In this study, we aimed to determine the importance of an early diagnosis for the treatment of urinary tract malformations (UTM) as well as the postnatal evaluation of growth and nutrition status and the frequency of urinary tract infection (UTI) in infants with AH. We evaluated 246 infants (183 boys, 63 girls) whose routine antenatal scans showed an anterior-posterior pelvic diameter (APPD) ≥5 mm. Of the 246 patients, 175 (71.1%) were found to be pathological and 71 were evaluated as normal after the follow-up period. The median follow-up periods of normal and abnormal cases were 45.7 and 43.4 months, respectively. All cases with or without UTM were evaluated in terms of UTI, scars on DMSA, growth [Height Z score (HZ), Weight Z score (WZ)] and nutrition [Weight height index (WHI)] status. The annual UTI frequency was higher in cases with UTM (1.32 ± 1.66 episode/year) than in cases without abnormality (0.27 ± 0.67 episode/year) (P < 0.001). The postnatal evaluation of growth and nutritional status in children with UTM (mean WHI, HZ, and WZ scores: 96.82 ± 10.21, 0.03 ± 0.54 and 0.04 ± 0.61, respectively) was found to be significantly worse than in cases without abnormality (102.25 ± 9.84, 0.14 ± 0.64 and 0.24 ± 0.76, respectively), (P < 0.05). In abnormal patients, the mean WHI, HZ, and WZ were significantly improved to 101.63 ± 9.75, 0.26 ± 1.07, and 0.28 ± 0.98, respectively, and HZ or WZ scores were found to be similar when compared to normals.

After excluding typical genital C. trachomatis infections, the majority of the remainder were considered to represent C. psittaci infections. Respiratory symptoms were the most common clinical manifestations of chlamydial infections detectable by CF, but the majority (58%) of the patients did not have pneumonia. Abdominal, neurological as well as urinary tract symptoms were common. Cutaneous, joint, cardiac, genital and ocular manifestations were also noted. Fever (greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C) was present in 62% of the patients. The ESR was raised (greater than or equal to 20 mm/h) in the majority of the patients (83%), but the leucocyte count was usually (86%) within normal limits. Because the clinical spectrum of C. psittaci infections is apparently broad, serological tests for detecting antibodies to C. psittaci (e.g. CF) should be used widely in various clinical conditions and not for patients with pneumonia alone."
CD009185,0,2657513,0,Gallium-67 scintigraphy in the detection of infected polycystic kidneys in renal transplant recipients.,Renal transplant recipients with underlying polycystic kidney disease (PKD) may present with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). This is often due to persistent infection in one or both of the native polycystic kidneys. It may be necessary to remove the infected kidney in order to remove the source of persistent infection. Gallium-67 scintigraphy was performed in 11 renal transplant recipients with underlying PKD. Positive studies were obtained in four recipients who had recurrent UTI. The scan also localized which of the kidneys (native or transplant) was the site of persistent infection. These four recipients subsequently had nephrectomy of the infected polycystic kidneys as suggested by the scan. Negative scans were obtained in seven recipients who did not have recurrent UTI. Gallium scintigraphy is a useful test for detecting and localizing the site of persistent UTI in renal transplant recipients with underlying PKD who present with recurrent UTI.

CD009185,0,11387151,0,Vesicoureteric reflux and renal scarring in Chinese children.,"Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and renal scarring are commonly found in children with urinary tract infection (UTI). The prevalence of VUR and scarring may vary between racial groups. There are no published data on the prevalence of VUR and scarring in Chinese children with UTI. A retrospective, single-institution study was made of Hong Kong Chinese children aged less than 5 years with a documented UTI investigated by both micturating cystourethrography and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. VUR was identified in 39% of 93 Chinese children with UTI. Renal scarring was present in 28% of boys, which is comparable with published data on Western children. Scarring appears to be less common in Chinese girls with UTI (11%) than in Western girls (30-38% from published data), and its severity is poorly related to VUR grade. There is a significant dependency relationship between grade of VUR and degree of scarring in Chinese boys (p < 0.05). In conclusion, renal scarring appears to be relatively uncommon in Chinese girls. The correlation between grade of VUR and degree of scarring in Chinese boys suggests a relationship, but provides no evidence about the direction of causation."

In a total of 42 animals examined, pathologic lesions were identified in 36 of the 46 kidneys subjected to VUR and urinary infection, but no lesions developed in the remaining 10 refluxing kidneys. While scintigraphic defects were invariably associated with pyelonephritic lesions (specificity 100%), some small lesions were not identified (sensitivity 80%). There was a significant association (p = < 0.001) between the degree of photon deficiency seen scintigraphically and the histologic changes (early and late lesions). However, the scintigraphic appearance of individual lesions was also influenced by factors such as their extent and density, so that consideration of the macroscopic characteristics was also important for precise correlation."

However, high gonadal radiation and intermittent imaging are the main disadvantages of VCUG.

Because of the unreliability of patient compliance with prescribed medications and because single-dose aminoglycoside therapy has been shown to be effective in women with cystitis, we assessed the efficacy of single-dose amikacin for treatment of first episodes of Escherichia coli lower urinary tract infection in girls. Upper and lower urinary tract infections were presumptively differentiated by simple criteria such as clinical symptoms, fever, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Fifty-four girls (ages 1 to 12 years) with two positive urine cultures (greater than 10(5) CFU/ml E. coli) were assigned by a table of random numbers to receive treatment with either sulfisoxazole 150 mg/kg/day orally for 10 days or a single dose of amikacin 7.5 mg/kg intramuscularly. Six of 23 patients (26%) in the amikacin group and four of 21 (19%) in the sulfisoxazole group had at least one positive urine culture within 40 days after completion of therapy. This difference was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.5). This suggests that a single dose of amikacin is as effective as a 10-day course of sulfisoxazole in the treatment of presumed first lower urinary tract infection in girls. Additional potential advantages of single-dose therapy are fewer side effects and less toxicity, excellent compliance, and reduced potential for selecting resistant organisms."

Both preparations are of high radiochemical purity. The biodistribution of both preparations was examined in experimental animals at different time intervals, from 15 min to 4 hr; the precentage of incorporation of 99mTc-DMS into kindeys is much higher (29.4% to 52.0%) than that of 99mTc-GH (12.80% to 22.20%). Both preparations accumulate to a greater extent in the renal cortex than in the medulla. The most suitable time for renal scintigraphy for 99mTc-DMS is 90--150 min while for 99mTc-GH it is 60--90 min.

The aim of this study was the evaluation of fibronectin and C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels in patients with sepsis and other infectious diseases without sepsis. In a case-control study, 90 patients with sepsis and 90 patients with other infectious diseases without sepsis were studied. Serum levels of fibronectin and CRP were measured. The data were analyzed by SPSS version 15. The mean levels of fibronectin in the cases and controls were 288.97±89.10 mg/l and 341.24±110.53 mg/l respectively (P=0.001). The mean levels of CRP in the cases and controls were 89.42±54.05 µg/ml and 27.42±25.89 µg/ml respectively (P<0.001). Concerning the source of infection, the mean CRP levels were significantly higher in septic patients with urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and soft tissue infection (P<0.001). Decreased levels of fibronectin and increased levels of CRP may be considered as reliable diagnostic markers for sepsis. Also, CRP could be a better predictive factor for sepsis than fibronectin."

(99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy was performed in 343 children with culture documented UTI (247 girls and 96 boys) aged from three months to 14 years (middle age of 4.82 years). The children studied were all those submitted for renal scintiscan to the Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Military Medical Academy, Belgrade during a five-year period (2000-2004). Micturating cystoureterography (MCU) performed in all patients before (99m)Tc-DMSA scan, revealed VUR in 213 children, while in 130 children VUR was not detected by MCU. In 15 of the 213 children the grade of VUR was I, in 88 was II, in 57 was III, in 33 was IV and 20 children had grade V of VUR. Findings of (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy were classified as: normal, equivocal and abnormal. Statistical analysis was performed using c(2)test. In all patients abnormal findings were detected in 38% (131/343), normal in 51% (174/343) and equivocal findings in 11% (38/343). In children with UTI and VUR the incidence of abnormal findings was 53% (112/213), of normal 37% (80/213) and of equivocal findings 10% (21/213). In children with UTI without VUR the incidence of abnormal findings was 15% (19/130), of normal findings 72% (94/130), and of equivocal findings 13% (17/130). The incidence of abnormal findings was significantly higher in children with UTI and VUR than in those with UTI without VUR (P<0.001). In children with VUR grades I, II, III, IV and V abnormal findings were 33%, 32%, 60%, 79% and 95% respectively. The incidence of abnormal findings was higher in children with VUR grades IV and V, than in grade I and II (P<0.001). Our results suggest that (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy in children can discriminate between grade I-II and IV-V of VUR and also that in children with UTI and VUR abnormal findings in the scintiscan were more than three times higher than in children with UTI alone."

Information was collected from children visiting the paediatric outpatient department with a first proven UTI, defined as a urine monoculture with > or = 10(5) organism/ml, with clinical symptoms and possible white cell count > or = 20 per high-power field of spun fresh urine. Children with neurologic bladder dysfunction were excluded. VUR was determined by voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and graded from I to V. The diagnostic value of predictors was judged using multivariate logistic modelling with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC area). A risk score was derived based on the regression coefficients of the independent predictors in the logistic model. In 140 children (51 boys and 89 girls) VUR was diagnosed in 37. Independent predictors for VUR were male gender, age, family history for uropathology, serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) and dilatation of the urinary tract on US. The ROC area of this model was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.87). This prediction model identified 12% (95% CI: 7-18) of the patients without VUR without missing one case of VUR. If we used VUR > or = grade 3 as a threshold, the model assessed VUR to be absent in 34% (95% CI: 26-42)."

Diagnostic criteria for septic complications and positive CRP response were defined in advance of the study. The CRP assays were carried out using an automated laser nephelometer system after the patient's discharge from the hospital. Forty-six septic complications were diagnosed in 40 patients. These complications consisted of wound infection (23), urinary tract infection (11), pneumonia (six), upper respiratory tract infection (three), intra-abdominal abscess (one), and other (two).

CD009185,0,21498838,0,Candida urinary tract infections--diagnosis.,"The finding of candiduria in a patient with or without symptoms should be neither dismissed nor hastily treated, but requires a careful evaluation, which should proceed in a logical fashion. Symptoms of Candida pyelonephritis, cystitis, prostatitis, or epididymo-orchitis are little different from those of the same infections produced by other pathogens. Candiduria occurring in critically ill patients should initially be regarded as a marker for the possibility of invasive candidiasis. The first step in evaluation is to verify funguria by repeating the urinalysis and urine culture. Pyuria is a nonspecific finding; the morphology of the offending yeast may allow separation of Candida glabrata from other species. Candida casts in the urine are indicative of renal candidiasis but are rarely seen. With respect to culture, colony counts have not proved to be diagnostically useful. In symptomatic or critically ill patients with candiduria, ultrasonography of the kidneys and collecting systems is the preferred initial study. However, computed tomography (CT) is better able to discern pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess. The role of magnetic resonance imaging and renal scintigraphy is ill defined, and prudent physicians should consult with colleagues in the departments of radiology and urology to determine the optimal studies in candiduric patients who require in-depth evaluation."

The clinical profile of patients and possible clinical features associated with renal scarring were analysed. These findings serve as a useful guide in the investigation and management of VUR in our population. The incidence of vesicoureteric reflux among patients investigated for documented urinary tract infection was high at 32.9%. The mean age at presentation was 15.2 months. Almost all patients were less than five years-old. A male predominance was noted in affected infants. High grade refluxes of Grade IV or more (International Reflux Study Classification) were found in 45.7/patients and were associated with a higher incidence of recurrent urinary tract infection (p less than 0.05). Thirty-four 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans were done and 46.4% of refluxing kidneys showed renal scars. The incidence of renal scarring was significantly higher in patients presenting at an early age (less than 2 years), in high grade reflux and in recurrent urinary tract infection (p less than 0.05; p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001 respectively). Therefore all children with documented urinary tract infection who are less than five years old and especially male infants should be fully investigated for early detection and treatment of vesicoureteric reflux and renal scars. Kidneys with vesicoureteric reflux at risk of scarring appeared to be those with early presentation, high grade reflux and recurrent urinary tract infection whose management should therefore be vigorous."

The medical records of 120 patients were assessed concerning gender, presence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), bladder capacity, detrusor overactivity, residual urine, febrile urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteriuria, constipation, detrusor sphincter incoordination (DSI), high detrusor pressure at maximal cystometric capacity (PMCC), low compliance, and thickness and trabeculation of the bladder wall. Renal scarring was diagnosed by (99m)technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan (DMSA). Renal scarring was detected in 38 patients (31%). VUR, UTI, decreased bladder capacity, urinary residue, and trabeculated and thick bladder wall were associated with scarring at univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed VUR (P < 0.0001) as the independent risk factor for renal scarring. Thickness of the bladder wall was a marginal risk factor (P = 0.07). Although UTI was not a risk factor, it was associated with VUR (P = 0.03). In our analysis, VUR was the main risk factor; however, renal scarring was probably due to multifactorial causes, as VUR was associated with UTI."

Systematic voiding cystourethrography then is recommended. However, for 60% to 80% of the children, voiding cystourethrography is a posteriori normal. Moreover, it is irradiating, painful, and expensive. Thus, selective approaches are needed.

When significant tracer was found in the urine, multiple scans of the abdomen were obtained to determine the location of the tracer. To confirm the site of the fistula, the tracer was mixed with barium and administered per rectum. Radiographs were obtained when significant activity was found in the urine. At surgery, bowel in the region of the cecum was adherent to the bladder, but no fistula was demonstrable by methylene blue instillation into the bladder. Postoperatively, the urinary tract infection cleared, and re-examination with oral Au198 colloid revealed no activity in the urine. The radiation dose to the gonads from this peocedure is 42 mrads.

Overall glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as well as single kidney GFR (SKGFR) were calculated using the combination of a left/right uptake ratio obtained from technetium 99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and 51chromium-EDTA plasma clearance. Forty-four patients with obvious unilateral or bilateral DMSA abnormalities were studied. In patients with unilateral lesions, both the overall GFR and the SKGFR were significantly higher during the acute phase of infection than several months later, on the abnormal side as well as the normal side. The relative percentage uptake was lower on the abnormal side than the normal side, obviously due to loss of functional parenchyma. This percentage increased significantly during the recovery phase, reflecting the total or partial healing of the renal lesions, despite the decrease of the corresponding SKGFR. However, during both the acute and the recovery phase, the relative percentage uptake of the abnormal kidney was in the normal range and often close to 50%.

Based on our previous reports that NGAL can be detected in the urine of children with urinary tract infection (UTI), we also asked whether MMP-9/NGAL complex could be detected in the urine of children with UTI. This multicenter, prospective study was conducted between October 2009 and October 2010. Seventy-one patients with symptomatic culture proven UTI, 37 asymptomatic children with contaminated urine and 37 healthy children were recruited. Mean uMMP-9/NGAL/Cr levels were significantly higher in the UTI group than in the control group (p < 0.0001). According to ROC analysis, the optimal cut-off level was 0.08 ng/mg to predict UTI. Using a cut-off value, sensitivity and specificity were 98.6 and 97.3%, respectively. The mean levels of uMMP-9/NGAL/cr in the UTI group were also significantly higher than those in the contamination group (p < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between contamination group and the control group (p = 0.21). The mean uMMP-9/NGAL/Cr in the UTI group were significantly higher before treatment than after treatment (p < 0.0001). The area under the curve was 0.997 (SE: 0.002, 95% CI: 0.993 to 1.001) for uMMP-9/NGAL/Cr. Urinary MMP-9/NGAL/Cr level was also correlated with positive urine nitrite test, positive urine leukocyte esterase reaction and renal scarring (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0001, p = 0.04, respectively) whereas was not correlated to leukocytosis and positive CRP level in serum. Urine MMP-9/NGAL/cr can be used as a diagnostic biomarker for UTI in children. Identification of NGAL-MMP-9/cr levels in the urine of suspected UTI patients may also be useful to differentiate between contamination and infection and for monitoring of treatment response in children."

Forty-four crossbred male piglets had surgical induction of vesicoureteral reflux at 2 weeks of age and introduction of urinary tract infection at 6 weeks. They were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. Between the ages of 2 and 6 weeks, 22 piglets received subcutaneous injections of formalin-killed Escherichia coli in incomplete Freund's adjuvant as described. The remaining 22 piglets received incomplete Freund's adjuvant and vehicle alone. The antibody responses to antigenic challenge were weak to moderate. Immunized animals tended to have less renal scarring and better renal tubular uptake of dimercaptosuccinic acid, in addition to significantly lower serum creatinine values (p less than 0.001) and less mesangial cell proliferation in glomeruli (p = 0.05). We conclude that previous exposure to a specific bacterial strain and bacterial immunization have at least a mild protective effect on the development of reflux nephropathy."

In fact, there is still no accurate method of localizing the infected tissue. The aims of the present study were to assess whether 111In labelled leukocytes (ILLs) accumulated in the infected tissue of acute prostatitis and if such uptake responded to treatment. We prospectively studied 10 adult male patients who had community acquired prostatitis and compared them with six male patients who had urinary tract infections but without prostatitis. An initial urinary culture and two blood cultures were carried out for each patient. All patients were followed up for 8 weeks after therapy was completed. Pre- and post-treatment scintigraphies were performed. Before treatment, all patients with prostatitis showed uptake of ILLs in the prostate area. After the patients had completed treatment with antibiotics, the scintigraphy results showed no uptake in the prostate area in 9/10 patients. The remaining patient showed a marked decrease in the uptake of ILLs. None of the six patients with urinary tract infection showed ILL uptake in the prostate region. It is suggested that ILLs could be useful for detecting acute prostatitis, especially in clinically ambiguous patients with urological infections. Furthermore, scintigraphy with 111In labelled leukocytes could help to determine the most appropriate course of therapy."

In this clinical study, BDNF levels were evaluated in association with pediatric CNS infections. BDNF levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 42 patients admitted during 5-year period, due to CNS infections, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Control samples were collected from 108 patients with non-CNS infections (urinary tract infection, acute upper respiratory infection, acute gastroenteritis, etc.). Mean values of BDNF levels, at various ages, were determined and compared. BDNF levels were below the sensitivity of the ELISA in most CSF samples from the control group, but were significantly elevated in the patients with bacterial meningitis. The serum BDNF levels were elevated in all subgroups of patients with CNS infections, and the elevation was particularly notable in those with bacterial meningitis. BDNF expression in the CSF was correlated with CSF interleukin (IL)-6 levels as well as with blood platelet counts and neurological prognoses in those with bacterial meningitis. No correlation was found between BDNF levels and serum leukocyte numbers or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. BDNF levels were found to be elevated in the serum and CSF of pediatric patients with CNS infections, particularly those with bacterial meningitis. Monitoring the changes in serum and CSF levels of BDNF may facilitate the diagnosis of acute meningitis and acute encephalopathy and allow the differential diagnosis of specific CNS infections."

The purpose of this study was to test the discriminative value of CRP in patients with neutrophilic leucocytosis of bacterial or systemic origin. Sixty patients presenting with an inflammatory syndrome with neutrophilia entered the study and were divided into 2 groups. Group I comprised 30 patients with Horton's disease (n = 9), systemic vasculitis (n = 6), deep cancer (n = 5), connective tissue disease (n = 4) or Still's disease (n = 4). Group II consisted on 30 patients with infective diseases: septicaemia (n = 13), bacterial pneumonia (n = 12), pyelonephritis (n = 4) or cholecystitis (n = 1). In both groups the number of neutrophils was higher than 12,000/cubic mm. Mean CRP values were lower in group I (75.3 +/- 70 mg/l) than in group II (153 +/- 61 mg/l) (P less than 0.01). With values above 100 mg/l the specificity and sensitivity of CRP for infection were 45% and 55% respectively; the positive predictive value of CRP was 66% and its negative predictive value 76%.

CD009185,0,7881994,0,Imaging techniques in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection.,"In terms of future morbidity and mortality, one of the most important considerations in urinary tract infection is the age of the patient. In adults, only those with complications or illnesses that fail to respond to treatment require investigation to exclude underlying pathology. In contrast, the young are at risk of future hypertensive and renal disease; imaging techniques are therefore of paramount importance to identify those with renal parenchymal disease at an early stage and permit appropriate and adequate treatment. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy is emerging as the method of choice for this purpose, because it combines high specificity and sensitivity with convenience, repeatability, and acceptable radiation doses. Voiding cystourethrography will also be required in many cases to exclude bladder pathology. New developments include the use of color Doppler ultrasonography and the nuclear magnetic resonance technique of rapid acquisition recall echo urography, both of which may become of value for the detection of scarring."

In addition, rises in urinary and serum immunoglobulins previously observed after vaginal immunization and induced cystitis were lessened. These observations appear to correspond with the classical concepts of immunologic unresponsiveness."

CD009185,0,2021813,0,Features of primary vesicoureteric reflux detected by prenatal sonography.,"Primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was detected by prenatal sonography in 34 infants (55 renal units); males accounted for 31 cases. Associated genitourinary anomalies were common, occurring in 29% of the patients. Some element of hydroureteronephrosis was noted at initial cystography in 89% of refluxing renal units, but the degree of renal abnormality at 99Tc DMSA renography was not predicted by the severity of VUR. Overall, 60% of refluxing renal units were renographically abnormal. Although a high rate of urinary infection was encountered during follow-up, most DMSA assessments were carried out prior to infection and hence likely reflect congenital rather than acquired abnormalities. It was concluded that renal impairment associated with high grade primary VUR is frequently present at birth and not secondary to subsequent infection."

We have developed a simplified technique, Bnai Zion Planar Method (BZPM), to estimate absolute DMSA uptake by the kidneys, which uses a shorter time of acquisition and does not require cumbersome calculations of attenuation correction. The aim of this study was to validate this technique by comparing it with the Quantitative DMSA single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (QDMSA) measurements as the reference method."

Among 110 urine cultures with > or = 10,000 colony-forming units per milliliter, 92 (84%) had > or = 100,000 CFU/ml, 10 (9%) had 50,000 to 99,000 CFU/CFU/ml and 8 (7%) had 10,000 to 49,000 CFU/ml. Urine specimens with 1000 to 49,000 CFU/ml were more likely than specimens with > or = 50,000 CFU/ml to yield Gram-positive or mixed organisms (36/60 vs 7/109; p < 0.001). A count of < 10 leukocytes/mm3 was almost invariably associated with a sterile culture; a count of > or = 10 leukocytes/mm3 was found in 93 of 102 patients with > or = 50,000 CFU/ml. The dipstick leukocyte esterase test had sensitivities of 52.9% and 66.7% in detecting > or = 10 leukocytes/mm3 and > or = 20 leukocytes/mm3, respectively. The dipstick nitrite test had a sensitivity of 31.4% in detecting bacteriuria (> or = 50,000 CFU/ml). Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed by a renal scan with dimercaptosuccinic acid labeled with technetium 99m in 50 (77%) of 65 patients with > or = 10 leukocytes/mm3 but in none of five patients with < 10 leukocytes/mm3 (p < 0.01). The findings in these five patients were consistent with colonization of the urinary tract rather than infection. For urine specimens obtained by catheter, we believe that urinary tract infection is best defined by both a leukocyte count > or 10/mm3 and a CFU count > or = 50,000/ml. This definition almost always discriminates among true urinary tract infection, bacteriuria resulting from contamination of the urine specimen, and asymptomatic bacteriuria."

The results of 257 111In WBC scans for which a definitive diagnosis was subsequently established were available for analysis. The findings are compared with those of ultrasound (130 cases) and computed tomography (82 cases) and the final clinical outcome. The sensitivity and specificity of the 111In WBC for the series were 97% and 91% respectively. The major cause of the false positive 111In WBC results was activity within the bowel not due to infection. Thrombus within the inferior vena cava caused a false positive 111In WBC result: this is previously undescribed. There were a large number of incorrect ultrasound results, particularly with abdominal and pelvic abscesses, pyelonephritis, peritonitis and non-infected fluid collections, showing that a negative ultrasound cannot exclude infection. The relative merits of the three modalities are discussed, emphasizing that more than one technique may be required to establish a diagnosis."

By univariate analysis, cytokine levels were related to age, sex, reflux, renal scarring, urine leukocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and bacterial properties (P fimbriae but not hemolysin). Multivariate modeling showed that urine IL-6 responses were higher in girls than boys, increased with age, and were positively associated with CRP, ESR, serum IL-6, and urine leukocyte counts. The urine IL-8 response was not influenced by age, but it was influenced by P fimbriae and was associated with ESR, CRP, urine leukocytes, and female sex. The results show that cytokine responses to urinary tract infection vary with the severity of infection and that cytokine activation is influenced by a variety of host and bacterial variables."

The mean age at presentation was 1.95 years. Grade I-V reflux occurred in 7.1%, 28.6%, 48.2%, 12.5%, 3.6% respectively. Thirty-one (55.3%) had detectable renal scars on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. All of them were treated with low dose prophylactic antibiotics until the age of 5 years. None had any major adverse effects to the prophylactic antibiotics. Ten (17.9%) had breakthrough UTI while on prophylaxis and 3 (5.4%) had UTI after discontinuing prophylaxis at 5 years of age. Two patients underwent ureteric reimplantation. Clinical and laboratory evidence of renal failure was not observed during the follow up period.

Mortality in these patients is significantly higher than in those with a functioning graft or on renal replacement therapy without having received a graft. Graft intolerance syndrome, early graft loss, severe proteinuria, recurring pyelonephritis or neoplasia, and chronic inflammation syndrome have all been proposed as indications for transplantectomy. Chronic inflammation syndrome occurs in patients with high levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein), anaemia resistant to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulators, and malnutrition markers. This inflammatory state is provoked by the graft, and reverts when a transplantectomy is performed, as several studies have shown. We have reviewed the medical literature published on this topic, the indications for transplantectomy and embolectomy, their advantages and disadvantages, the incidence of graft intolerance syndrome, and the pathophysiology of chronic inflammation syndrome, as well as the currently proposed therapeutic management algorithm."

In 94% of non-infected infants CRP was less than or equal to 15 mg/l and 82% had CRP less than 10 mg/l up to 3 days of age. After 3 days of age 96% had CRP less than 10 mg/l. The initial CRP level was increased in 16 out of 18 patients (89%) with bacterial septicemia. Low CRP was seen in one patient with total agranulocytosis and septicemia from Streptococcus type B and in one patient with Staphylococcus albus sepsis. A rise in CRP was also seen in very pre-term infants with septicemia. Increased initial CRP was uncommon in neonatal urinary tract infection (2 of 9), but a rise was seen in 3 additional patients. A comparison between CRP, total neutrophil blood cell count and band neutrophil count as diagnostic parameters was in favour of CRP at this early stage of infection. CRP is of definite value as an aid in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia and bacterial meningitis."
CD009185,0,6204873,0,99mTc-aprotinin: a new tracer for kidney morphology and function.,"Aprotinin (Ap), a low-molecular-weight polypeptide (6500 dalton), is a protease inhibitor which is electively and stably accumulated in the kidney. In 112 adult patients, with either uni- or bilateral renal disease with different degrees of renal impairment (from normal GFR to advanced renal failure), renal scans were performed by means of Ap labelled with 99mTc. Highly satisfactory renal scans were obtained in all patients. In 20 patients with renal failure (serum creatinine 1.8-8.5 mg/dl, mean 4.7) a comparison was made of the renal scans obtained with 99mTc-Ap and with 99mTc-DMSA. 99mTc-Ap was slightly better than 99mTc-DMSA, especially in patients with far advanced renal failure. Some aspects of the pharmacokinetics of 99mTc-Ap were studied in 72 cases. In 22 of these patients plasma clearance of 99mTc-Ap was determined by the single injection method using a two-compartment model. In patients with GFR greater than 90 ml/min plasma clearance of 99mTc-Ap was 67.6 +/- 8.4 SD ml/min. A good correlation was observed between plasma clearance of 99mTc-Ap and GFR (r = 0.74). After IV injection 99mTc-Ap was stably fixed by the kidney. Renal radioactivity remained stable between the second and eighth hour after the injection. Urinary excretion of radioactivity measured in 35 patients in the first and in the second 2-h interval after IV injection of 99mTc-Ap was negligible in all patients (2.7 +/- 1.5 SD percent of the dose in the first 2 h; 2.8 +/- 1.4 SD between the second and fourth hour). 99mTc-Ap is an excellent agent for renal imaging. It also seems promising for renal function studies."

When imaging is requested in these cases, CT scan with and without contrast enhancement is preferable; however, depending on the condition of the patient and preference of the clinician an IVU, sonogram, or radionuclide scan may also provide adequate information. Patients at higher risk for complications, such as renal or perinephric abscesses with or without PHN and EPN, require aggressive and vigorous clinical and radiologic monitoring. CT scan is superior to other imaging modalities in the investigation of these complications. Interventional percutaneous procedures are established as safe and effective means of controlling or curing the infection in many patients and are often chosen over traditional surgical technique. The radiologist thus is an indispensable member of the management team and should be available for consultation and intervention."
CD009185,0,10656274,0,Reappraisal of Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy for follow up in children with vesicoureteral reflux.,"We reviewed Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in order to assess whether repeated Tc-99m DMSA scans are necessary for the follow up of these patients. Ninety-seven children who were followed up for more than one year (1-7.4 years, average 2.8 years) after the first DMSA scan were included in the study. Fifty-one patients had been diagnosed as primary VUR and 46 as secondary VUR. Age at the first examination ranged from 0 to 14 years (average 5.1 years). Planar images were taken 2 hours after injection. The % renal uptake per injected dose (%RU) was calculated from posterior images. Kidneys in 11 patients (11.3%) changed morphologically during the follow up. Of these, new photon deficient areas (PD) were detected in only 4 patients (4.1%). All of these 4 patients had neurogenic bladder and were managed with self-catheterization. Of the remaining 7 patients, cortical thinning progressed in 5 patients (5.2%) and PDs resolved in 3 patients (3.1%). In one of these 7 patients, PD resolved in one kidney and cortical thinning progressed in the contralateral kidney. Of 97 patients reviewed, % RU decreased more than 20% during the follow up in 6 patients (6.2%). All were diagnosed as secondary VUR due to neurogenic bladder. %RU decreased only in the contracted kidneys at the initial scan. Two of them underwent renal transplantation because of severe renal failure. In conclusion, new PD rarely developed and % RU decreased in only a few patients during the follow up of children with VUR. Repeated Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy therefore seems to have little benefit in the follow up of children with VUR. It should be performed in selected patients with high risk of urinary tract infection or renal failure."

Sixty-three of these children who had the examinations carried out within a 6-month period were assessed in detail.

Diagnosis is mainly clinical and atypical presentations have seldom been reported. The diagnostic role of imaging techniques has not been defined. Five cases of acute graft pyelonephritis are reported (three kidney, two pancreas-kidney grafts). The patients (median age 48 years) comprised three females and two males. Median post-transplant follow-up was 3 months, with three patients having predisposing factors for diabetes and one for an enteric bladder. None of the patients presented the 'classic' diagnostic tetrad (i.e. fever, positive urine cultures, low urinary tract symptoms and serum creatinine increase); although, at diagnosis, two of five patients presented with fever, one had increased creatinine levels and one had positive urine cultures. Of note, three patients had leucocyte casts at urinary sediment analysis, thus raising clinical suspicion. Renal ultrasounds were negative in all patients. Renal (99m)Tc-MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) scintigraphy, which was used for the definition of kidney function impairment (one patient) or because of the presence of urinary casts (three patients), or after the biopsy diagnosis to locate the parenchymal lesions (one patient), was positive in all patients. The presence and pyelonephritic origin of the parenchymal lesions was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance or computed tomography scans. Acute graft pyelonephritis may develop in the absence of a full-blown clinical picture. Smouldering symptoms may occur in the presence of large perfusion deficits. (99m)Tc-MAG3 scintigraphy could be an important diagnostic tool in such cases."

In recent years, computed tomography, ultrasound, nuclear scintigraphy, excretory urography (IVP) and magnetic resonance imaging have offered varying degrees of utility in evaluating renal infection. Although imaging in acute pyelonephritis has been extensively studied, this condition is a rare initial presentation as a renal cystic feature. This investigation presents a case of acute pyelonephritis, with an atypical initial imaging manifestation in renal cystic feature, which became a heterogeneous mass during follow up, and disappeared after treatment. Two conclusions can be drawn: first, a renal cystic lesion may be an initial presentation of acute pyelonephritis; secondly, the abnormalities of the ultrasonography imaging study of renal pyelonephritis persisted and progressed despite the improvement in clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, and displayed complete resolution of imaging abnormalities several months later."
CD009185,0,859036,0,The role of Ga-67 citrate imaging and diagnostic ultrasound in patients with suspected abdominal abscesses.,"Fifty patients with suspected abdominal abscesses were examined by [67Ga[ Gallium citrate imaging and abdominal sonography.

Nineteen patients had true-negative radionuclide images and sonography, and one had a false-positive result by both procedures. The remaining 15 patients did not have abdominal abscesses, but did have other abnormalities (e.g., pyelonephritis, extra-abdominal sites of inflammation) which were detected by the nuclide study. Gallium-67 imaging and abdominal ultrasound have similar sensitivity for detection of abdominal abscesses. A significant advantage of Gallium imaging is its ability to detect other inflammatory foci (both within and outside the abdomen)."
CD009185,0,11753132,0,Diagnosis and imaging in urinary tract infections.,"The aim of imaging in urinary tract infection is to detect conditions that must be treated in order to avoid immediate deterioration or recurrences, and probable long-term kidney damage. In newborns identified with hydronephrosis during pregnancy or by neonatal screening, vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring are congenital and not caused by infection. Most of these patients are male and the vesicoureteral reflux is of a higher grade than that detected in girls having had urinary tract infection. In children with urinary tract infection, several authors advocate a more selective policy and recommend imaging only in those children who are at risk for developing renal damage. In adult females no imaging is necessary in cystitis, whereas ultrasonography and plain films are recommended in acute pyelonephritis. Because uncomplicated urinary tract infection in men is rare, diagnostic evaluation including imaging should be started early in order to rule out complicating factors within the urinary tract. The role of imaging in prostatitis, vesiculitis, epididymitis and orchitis is primarily to rule out abscess formation, but also to exclude testicular malignancies."

CD009185,0,3283989,0,[The role of ultrasonics in the diagnosis of kidney diseases].,"A retrospective comparative assessment of the diagnostic value of excretory urography (EU), scintigraphy (SCG) and ultrasonography (USG) of the kidneys was conducted in 100 patients. The diagnosis in 26 patients was confirmed by CT, angiography, at operation or autopsy. Chronic pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 54% of the patients, renal changes in essential hypertension--9%, hydronephrosis in 8%, abnormal shape and position of the kidneys in 8%, malignant tumors in 7%, chronic glomerulonephritis in 8%, renal cysts in 2%, multicystosis in 1%, kidney contusion in 1%, paranephritis in 1%, and apostematous nephritis in 1%.

CD009185,0,3895818,0,Single-dose netilmicin therapy of complicated and uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in children.,"Thirty children (age 3 months to 10 years) with complicated and uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections were treated with a single intramuscular injection of netilmicin 4.5 mg/kg. The diagnosis of lower urinary tract infection was based on the absence of fever and the presence of normal values for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein concentration and urinary excretion of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. Follow-up urine cultures in all children demonstrated a cure rate of 97% and reinfection and relapse rates each of 7% respectively. The subgroup (12 children) with radiological abnormalities of urinary tract showed a cure rate of 92%, and reinfection and relapse rates of 9% respectively. The rates of cure, reinfection and relapse in the complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections were not statistically different (p greater than 0.05). A pharmacokinetic study (performed in 5 children) demonstrated that netilmicin urinary concentrations were over the MIC's of the infecting organisms up to 96 hours after the single-dose injection. Netilmicin was well tolerated and no side effects appeared during treatment. Single-dose netilmicin therapy is an effective and safe regimen for complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections in children. The response to single-dose netilmicin therapy seems to be related to its prolonged urinary elimination."

CD009185,0,18071688,0,"Evaluation of reflux nephropathy, pyelonephritis and renal dysplasia.","MR urography has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the relationship between reflux nephropathy, pyelonephritis, vesicoureteric reflux and renal dysplasia. MR urography utilizes multiple parameters to assess both renal anatomy and function and provides a more complete characterization of acquired and congenital disease. Pyelonephritis and renal scarring can be distinguished by assessing the parenchymal contours and signal intensity. Characteristic imaging features of renal dysplasia include small size, subcortical cysts, disorganized architecture, decreased and patchy contrast enhancement as well as a dysmorphic pelvicalyceal system. Because of its ability to subdivide and categorize this heterogeneous group of disorders, it seems inevitable that MR urography will replace DMSA renal scintigraphy as the gold standard for assessment of pyelonephritis and renal scarring. MR urography will contribute to our understanding of renal dysplasia and its relationship to reflux nephropathy."
CD009185,0,1352870,0,Escherichia coli virulence factors and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan in children with febrile urinary tract infection.,Correlation of virulence factors of Escherichia coli with renal inflammation documented by 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan was undertaken in 59 children with febrile urinary tract infections to identify more accurately the role of bacterial virulence factors in the development of pyelonephritis. P fimbriae were present in 63% of isolates from the positive scan group and 83% of those from the negative scan group (P = 0.126). Multivariate regression analysis showed no significant role for established E. coli virulence factors in the development of pyelonephritis. The pap genome was independently associated with negative scan (P less than 0.007) and with the absence of reflux (P = 0.031). E. coli pyelonephritogenic clone O16:K1:H6 was isolated from negative scan patients and did not produce hemolysin. We conclude that P fimbriae are important in the development of febrile urinary tract infection regardless of the level of infection. Virulent E. coli clones described in prior Scandinavian urinary tract infection studies were not common causes of pyelonephritis in our patient population.

CD009185,0,19841948,1,Urinary macrophage migration inhibitory factor in children with urinary tract infection.,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) plays an essential pathophysiological role in inflammatory reactions. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical utility of urine MIF (uMIF) level in predicting urinary tract infections (UTI). This multicenter, prospective study was conducted over a 1-year period between March 2008 and March 2009. Sixty patients with symptomatic culture-proven UTI and 29 healthy children were recruited. Urine MIF was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean MIF level was found to be significantly higher in the UTI group than in the control group (1082.82 vs. 211.45 pg/ml, p = 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the optimal cut-off uMIF level was 295 pg/ml for uMIF to predict UTI. The sensitivity and specificity of this cut-off level were 91.7% and 69%, respectively. Mean uMIF/creatinine (Cr) was also significantly higher in the UTI group than in the control group (2400.69 vs. 267.56 pg/mgCr, p = 0.0001). At a cut-off of 815 pg/mgCr for uMIF/Cr, the sensitivity and specificity were 95 and 79%, respectively. The area under curve (AUC) was 0.848 (standard error 0.040, 95% confidence interval 0.756-0.915) for uMIF and 0.889 (0.034, 0.805-0.946) for uMIF/Cr. Urine MIF/Cr was significantly higher in the patients with a positive leukocyte esterase reaction in the urine (p = 0.047), leukocytosis (p = 0.0001) and positive C-reactive protein level in serum (p = 0.003). The uMIF level was not related to leukocytosis, positive CRP level in serum and leukocyte esterase reaction in the urine. Neither uMIF nor uMIF/Cr were correlated to the positive urine nitrite test, pyuria, urine pH and specific gravity (p > 0.05). These results suggest that urine MIF and uMIF/Cr can be used for the early prediction of UTI in children."
CD009185,0,1433579,0,The detection and characterization of vesicoureteral reflux in the child.,"Voiding cystourethrography or radionuclide cystography should be performed in the child in whom it is important to know whether reflux is present. Voiding cystourethrography is more accurate in characterizing and grading reflux, and monitoring is intermittent. Conversely, radionuclide cystography uses a lower radiation dose and its continuous monitoring leads to fewer false negative results but its ability to characterize reflux is poor. The performance of voiding cystourethrography or radionuclide cystography to detect reflux is an art as well as a science. These tests are done best by those who are experienced and interested in imaging the urinary tract of the child. At our hospital we perform voiding cystourethrography in all young children with urinary tract infection to detect and precisely characterize reflux to enable intelligent planning of management. In older patients, when it is less likely that reflux is present but it is still desirable to ensure that reflux is not occurring, radionuclide cystography is performed. If reflux is present, then a decision is made on an individual basis as to whether additional characterization by voiding cystourethrography is needed. Radionuclide cystography is also used for family screening, for periodic followup of reflux being managed nonoperatively and to ensure that reflux has been eliminated after antireflux surgery."
CD009185,0,7715992,0,Acute pyelonephritis as a cause of hyponatremia/hyperkalemia in young infants with urinary tract malformations.,"Obstructive uropathy causes tubular resistance to aldosterone and severe metabolic imbalance may be precipitated by an episode of pyelonephritis. In the last 3 years we investigated 52 episodes of pyelonephritis (positive urine culture, elevated C reactive protein, fever, elevated neutrophil count) in 50 children between 15 days and 15 months of age. Ultrasonography voiding cystography and renal scintiscan were performed in all cases and i.v. urography in some. A salt-losing syndrome with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia (Na < 125 meq/liter; K > 6.3 meq/liter) was observed in 17 infants < 3 months, accompanied by plasma aldosterone concentration of 5000 to 23,000 pg/ml (normal value, < 1000 pg/ml). All these children had a severe urinary tract (UT) malformation (ureteropelvic junction stenosis in 7 cases, vesicoureteral reflux in 7, posterior urethral valves in 2, double system in 1). Thirteen infants < 3 months, 7 with no urinary tract malformations, did not have electrolyte imbalance. Pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 20 other patients ages 4 to 15 months, including 16 with severe UT malformations; 4 had normal UTs. We conclude that a salt-losing syndrome with tubular resistance to aldosterone can occur during pyelonephritis in young infants with congenital UT malformation, that the risk diminishes considerably or disappears after 3 months of age and that in the absence of UT malformation pyelonephritis does not cause acute sodium loss of clinical relevance."
CD009185,0,1681043,1,"Relationship among vesicoureteral reflux, P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, and acute pyelonephritis in children with febrile urinary tract infection.","Ninety-four children with febrile urinary tract infection were studied prospectively to determine the relationship between vesicoureteral reflux, P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, and acute pyelonephritis, and to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of commonly used clinical and laboratory observations. By using renal scan with dimercaptosuccinic acid labeled with technetium 99m as the standard of reference, we documented acute pyelonephritis in 62 (66%) of 94 patients. Vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 29 (31%) of the total group and in only 23 (37%) of 62 patients with pyelonephritis. Of the 70 E. coli urinary isolates, 48 (69%) were P-fimbriated, including 30 (64%) of 47 isolates from patients with pyelonephritis and 18 (78%) of 23 isolates from patients with normal renal scans. The prevalence of P-fimbriated E. coli in patients with pyelonephritis and vesicoureteral reflux was 46%, compared with 71% in those with pyelonephritis who had no concurrent vesicoureteral reflux (p = 0.222). Multiple clinical and laboratory variables commonly used in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis did not adequately predict the presence or absence of parenchymal involvement. These data show the following: (1) Acute pyelonephritis in the absence of demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux is common. (2) Febrile urinary tract infections in children are commonly associated with P-fimbriated E. coli, both in the presence and absence of vesicoureteral reflux. (3) The presence of P fimbriae alone does not fully explain the pathophysiology of renal parenchymal invasion by bacteria in the absence of vesicoureteral reflux. (4) The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children with febrile urinary tract infections on the basis of clinical and laboratory observations is unreliable."
CD009185,0,18690985,0,Efficacy and safety study of fixed-dose combination of ceftriaxone-vancomycin injection in patients with various infections.,"Pathogens can infect almost all tissues and cause serious infections. Objective was to evaluate efficacy and safety of fixed-dose combination of Ceftriaxone-Vancomycin in patients with various infections. Patients (n=305) suffering from different bacterial infections (serious respiratory tract disease, bronchitis, gastrointestinal tract infections, urinary tract infection, cellulites and meningitis) were enrolled. Patients were randomized into two groups depending on severity of illness. Group A (n=106) and Group B (n=199) patients were given intravenous dose of fixed-dose combination 1.5 g B.D. and 3.0 g B.D. respectively for 3-10 days. Hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urea, creatinine levels serum glutamyl oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamyl pyruvic transaminase activities were recorded before and on completion of the treatment. Most of patients (70%) were cured in seven or less than seven days of the treatment. Significant decrease in total leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels were observed indicating patients were cured from the infections. No significant alterations were observed in hemoglobin, serum urea, creatinine levels, glutamyl oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamyl pyruvic transaminase activities on completion of treatment. The fixed-dose combination of Ceftriaxone-Vancomycin, is found to be effective in treating various bacterial infections without any toxic effect on liver and kidney. Patients well tolerated the drug without major adverse effects."
CD009185,0,2996289,0,Combined [99mTc]DMSA kidney scintigraphy and [131I]hippuran renography in children with urinary tract infections.,"Combined [99mTc]DMSA kidney scintigraphy and [131I]hippuran renography were performed consecutively in 87 children with recurrent urinary tract infections in a retrospective study. This procedure allows a description of renal cortical morphology, split function determination and run-off evaluation. Signs of cortical scarring were found in 41 of 172 kidneys (24%) and were significantly associated with vesico-ureteral reflux (p less than 0.001) and with delayed urinary run-off (p less than 0.01). Split renal function was significantly reduced in kidneys with unilateral scarring (p less than 0.001). The radio-isotope investigations and intravenous urography were performed within 3 months of each other in 56 patients (110 kidneys). Good agreement between the findings was found except for 13 kidneys, where cortical activity defects were revealed by scintiscan despite normal urography. The extended scintigraphic procedure described is considered useful for urological screening of children with urinary tract infections and may thus replace urography as a first-line investigation. It should be followed by micturition cysto-urethrography when evaluation for vesico-ureteral reflux is indicated."

Since signs and symptoms of brucellosis resemble many other diseases, misdiagnosis and related increase in morbidity rate, are common. In this report, a case of brucellosis complicated with endocarditis, pyelonephritis, sacroileitis and thyroiditis, was presented. The case was a 32-years-old female patient in whom the diagnosis of brucellosis was delayed by 12 months since it was not taken into consideration during the clinical follow-up of the patient in various clinical centers. The patient was admitted to our center with the complaints of fever, headache, back pain, night sweats, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, dysuria and polyuria. The patient had a history of consumption of raw milk and dairy products. Positive Brucella tube agglutination test (1/1280) and isolation of Brucella spp. in blood cultures led to the diagnosis of brucellosis. Sacroileitis was diagnosed upon pain on right hip joint movements, pain and restriction at the same joint in FABER test. The detection of vegetation during echocardiography, cardiac murmur during physical examination and the determination of increased ESR and CRP levels led to the diagnosis of endocarditis. Abdominal ultrasonography and urinalysis results (hematuria, proteinuria and pyuria) revealed pyelonephritis and increased free T3 and T4, decreased TSH and positive anti-thyroid autoantibodies (anti-TG, anti-TPO) revealed thyroiditis. Treatment was started with combination of rifampisin (1 x 600 mg/day) and doxycycline (2 x 100 mg/day). After the diagnosis of endocarditis, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (3 x 960 mg/day) and streptomycin (1 x 1 g/day) were added to the treatment. Valve replacement surgery was planned, however, the patient didn't accept surgical intervention and antimicrobial treatment continued with streptomycin for 21 days and other antibiotics for six months. The patient exhibited significant improvement after the medical treatment. Although sacroileitis is a frequent complication of brucellosis, endocarditis, thyroiditis and pyelonephritis are among the rare complications. In cases of brucellosis with multiorgan involvement including endocarditis, successful results may be achieved by aggressive antimicrobial treatment. In endemic areas, brucellosis should always be taken into consideration in patients with fever of unknown origin and multisystem involvement."

A continuous series of 103 sequential scintigraphies and clearance measurements were performed with the new technetium-labelled agent MAG3 (Gamma-kamera, Phillips Tomo Diagnost) and 131I-orthohippuric acid (OIH) using the Oberhausen method (Nucleopan, Siemens). The time-activity curves obtained with the two radionuclides agreed exactly. Reaching a tubular excretion rate of nearly 90%, the clearance of MAG3 differed by no more than 6% from the OIH clearance in 95% of the cases. The factor between clearances of the two radionuclides was determined by means of a commercially available software according to the Oberhausen method and amounted to 0.59 +/- 0.09. The favorable physical properties and high activity of MAG3 permit exact examination of tubular function and better assessment of renal morphology than hippuran-labelled radionuclides. The low radiation dose combined with a better spatial resolution, especially, the constant availability in a nuclear medicine department should give the preference to MAG3."

CD009185,0,8129430,1,Renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis.,"Seventy six children, 18 boys and 58 girls, aged 0-15.9 (median 1.0) years, with acute pyelonephritis were prospectively studied with a technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan during infection and two months later. Fifty nine of these children were also studied two years after the infection. Seventeen children with a normal DMSA scan during infection or at two months after infection, or both, were not investigated by a DMSA scan at two years after acute pyelonephritis. A micturition cystourethrogram was performed in all the children after two months. Changes on the DMSA scan were found in 65 (86%) children during acute pyelonephritis, in 45 (59%) children at two months, and in 28 (37%) children at two years after infection. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was found in 19 (25%) children at two months. Renal scarring was significantly correlated with the presence of gross VUR and recurrent pyelonephritis, but 62% of the scarred kidneys were drained by non-refluxing ureters. Children with scars were older at the time of acute pyelonephritis than those without scars but no difference was found between the groups with regard to duration of illness, levels of C reactive protein and maximum white cell count, glomerular filtration rate, nor renal concentration capacity at the time of infection. It is concluded that renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis in children is more common than has been previously thought. Although children with gross VUR and recurrent pyelonephritis are at the greatest risk, renal scarring is more often seen without these risk factors."

Of 112 patients (65 boys), 55 had moderate and 57 had severe malnutrition; 43 had diarrhea and 35 had fever. Clean-catch and suprapubic urine specimens were examined microscopically and cultured. Significant bacteriuria was found in 17 (15.2%) malnourished and 2 (1.8%) control subjects ( P<0.01). The incidence of bacteriuria in malnourished and normally nourished subjects with fever was 28.6% and 5.7%, respectively ( P<0.05). The risk of bacteriuria increased significantly with the severity of malnutrition and in patients with diarrhea. Bacteriuria was associated with symptoms (70.6%) and elevated levels of acute-phase reactants (88.2%), indicating the presence of urinary tract infections (UTI) rather than asymptomatic colonization. Our observations show that malnourished children, particularly those with fever, are at risk for UTI. Urinalysis is useful for screening for UTI in these subjects. Urine culture should be performed in patients showing an abnormal urinalysis, and if the likelihood of detecting bacteriuria is high (as in patients with fever or diarrhea). Significant bacteriuria in malnourished subjects should be treated with appropriate antimicrobials."

The results were compared with regard to their reliability to diagnose renal involvement, using (1) DMSA scintigraphy and (2) final diagnosis as the gold standard. Sixty-seven children clinically had renal involvement. Sensitivity increased from 84.1% using only aCDS to 92.1% for the combined US approach, using DMSA scintigraphy as the reference standard. When correlated with the final diagnosis, sensitivity for DMSA scintigraphy was 92.5%; sensitivity for comprehensive US was 94.0%. Our data demonstrate an increasing sensitivity using the combination of renal greyscale US supplemented by aCDS for differentiation of upper from lower UTI.

They were randomly assigned to be treated for 6 months either with chemoprophylaxis (200 mg of norfloxacin) or conventional therapy (without any antimicrobials except when overt UTI occurred). After a 4 months of washout period, the protocols were exchanged with each other and next 6 months of trial was carried out. All cases were followed at least 4 months after the discontinuance of the chemoprophylaxis. The difference of efficacy between the two modalities was evaluated by periodical examinations of urine cultures, urinalysis and inflammatory markers. During chemo-prophylaxis, the frequency of the symptomatic UTI (bacteriuria greater than 10(4)/ml, pyuria greater than 5/HPF, CRP greater than +) was 0.267/patient.year which was significantly lower than during conventional therapy (2.97/patient.year, p less than 0.01). This prophylactic effect remained 4 months after the discontinuance of the drug. On the other hand, bacteriuria was persistent in more than half of patients with chemoprophylaxis. Minimal inhibitory concentration of norfloxacin for separated bacteria revealed that the resistant species steeply increased from 4 to 6 months after the beginning of chemoprophylaxia. These species disappeared 4 months after the drug was discontinued. Optimal durations of chemoprophylaxis and drug-holidays were discussed."

The rats were studied with DMSA scintigraphy either before and 5 days after the infection or 5 and 28 days after the infection. One group of rats received anti-microbial treatment during days 6-11. After the last DMSA scintigraphy the rats were sacrificed and the kidneys prepared for light microscopy study. Kidney morphology was normal and DMSA uptake was high and homogeneous in all control rats. The majority of the rats exposed to E. coli developed inflammatory changes, on light microscopy which extended to various degrees in the renal parenchyma. Five days after the infection the DMSA uptake was consistently reduced, if the inflammatory lesion on light microscopy involved more than 15% of the renal cortex. Twenty-eight days after infection the inflammatory changes were less extensive than at 5 days. The DMSA uptake had usually improved. At this time, however, areas of decreased DMSA uptake could be detected even if the light microscopy changes involved less than 15% of the parenchyma. Microscopical lesions were less frequent and less extensive in the treated than in the untreated rats. The complete return to normal of previously abnormal DMSA uptake was only observed in treated rats. In a few untreated rats cortical scars had formed by day 28. The scars appeared in areas with decreased DMSA uptake at 5 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Urine and serum samples were also collected 2 weeks after the infection and during a subsequent episode of cystitis (n = 8) or asymptomatic bacteriuria (n = 8). Concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were related to the expression of 5 virulence markers of E. coli and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after pyelonephritis. Patients with acute pyelonephritis had elevated urine and serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels as compared to 37 healthy women (IL-6: p < 0.001 in both cases, and IL-8: p < 0.001 in both cases). Patients infected with E. coli producing hemolysin and/or cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) had significantly higher IL-6 levels in serum during acute pyelonephritis as compared to patients infected with strains without the ability to produce these factors (p = 0.0025 and p = 0.0154, respectively). Patients who had high concentrations of IL-8 in urine during acute pyelonephritis had lower GFR at follow-up as compared to patients with lower levels of IL-8 in urine (r = -0.48, p = 0.0123). In conclusion, acute pyelonephritis is accompanied by elevated urinary and serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Bacteria producing hemolysin and CNF seem to induce higher concentrations of IL-6 in serum. The secretion of IL-8 from renal cells may participate in the initiation and maintenance of renal inflammation which in turn may influence renal function."

To differentiate between those with a severe bacterial infection and those with a localised bacterial or a viral infection can be a challenge. This review provides an overview of neonatal and paediatric studies that assess the use of procalcitonin as an early marker of bacterial infection. Procalcitonin is an excellent marker for severe, invasive bacterial infection in children. However, the use of procalcitonin in the diagnosis of neonatal bacterial infection is complicated, but if correctly used procalcitonin results in a higher specificity than C-reactive protein. In addition, procalcitonin has been shown to correlate with severity of disease (urinary tract infections and sepsis), and can therefore be used as a prognostic marker. Procalcitonin is therefore a useful additional tool for the diagnosis of bacterial disease in neonates and children."

However, due to uncertainties about the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical and laboratory parameters used in these studies, true sensitivity of renal cortical scintigraphy was unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of [99mTc]DMSA scintigraphy in the diagnosis of experimentally induced acute pyelonephritis in piglets using strict histopathologic criteria as the standard of reference. The sensitivity and specificity of the DMSA scan for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis were 91% and 99%, respectively, with an overall 97% agreement between the scintigraphic and histopathologic findings. Based on the results of this experimental study, we used the [99mTc]DMSA scan as the standard of reference for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, and conducted a prospective clinical study of 94 children hospitalized with the diagnosis of acute febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). The aims of this study were (1) to determine the relationship among vesicoureteral reflux, P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, acute pyelonephritis, and renal scarring, and (2) to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of the clinical and laboratory parameters commonly used in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. We documented acute pyelonephritis in 62 (66%) of 94 patients. Vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 29 (31%) of the total group and in only 23 (37%) of 62 patients with acute pyelonephritis. The prevalence of P-fimbriae in the E coli isolates was 64% in the patients with acute pyelonephritis and 78% in those with a normal DMSA scan. Even in patients without reflux, P-fimbriae were found in 71% of isolates from the patients with acute pyelonephritis and in 75% of those with a normal renal scan. Follow-up DMSA scans were obtained in 33 patients with acute pyelonephritis in 38 kidneys.

A one-day or ten-day regimen of cefadroxil (30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses) was assigned randomly to 80 children who had acute urinary tract infection and CRP concentrations less than 28 microgram/ml (CRP-negative group). Ten days of cefadroxil therapy was used to treat 44 children with urinary tract infection and CRP values greater than or equal to 28 microgram/ml (CRP-positive group). The clinical and laboratory characteristics of the children in the two CRP-negative therapy groups were similar to, but different from those of children with CRP-positive infections. Recurrent infections occurred significantly more often at four to five days after completion of therapy in CRP-negative children who received one day (44.4%) compared to ten days (20%) of cefadroxil therapy (P less than .05). When data from this study were combined with those from our previously published investigation of short-term antibiotic therapy in CRP-negative children, a significantly larger percentage of recurrences was documented immediately after one or four days of antibiotics (79%) compared to recurrences after the standard ten-day regimen (41%). Additionally, the total rate of recurrent infections for all children in both studies was significantly larger in those who received short-term therapy (48%) as opposed to conventional therapy (34%).

Twenty-four hours after the onset of antibiotic treatment, the C-reactive protein (CRP) level continued to be high, while the serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and the urine IL-6, IL-8, albumin, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels decreased significantly. In contrast, serum creatinine and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels and urine N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, alpha1-microglobulin, and beta2-microglobulin levels did not change over time. There was a significant correlation between IL-6 and IL-8 levels and urine albumin and IgG levels (urine albumin and IgG levels are glomerular and urinary tract-injury markers) as well as between serum CRP levels and the levels of the tubular-injury markers.

The results were compared with those of technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Noninvasive evaluations were made to localize the site of the UTI. Increased urinary beta 2M/Creatinine (Cr) or microalbumin/Cr quotients were not associated with renal inflammation, as defined by a positive renal scan. Increased urinary microalbumin/Cr is associated with UTI in febrile patients regardless of the level of infection (scan status), and may be an informative indicator of UTI. When microalbumin/Cr was > or = 0.03, its sensitivity and specificity to predict UTI in febrile patients, regardless of the site of the infection, were 95.65% and 51.79%, respectively, and its positive predictive value was 62.0%. On the other hand, urinary beta 2M/Cr (> or = 0.13) demonstrates a statistically significant correlation with the presentation of a high grade of vesicoureteral reflux (p = 0.02). We suggest that a prompt renal imaging study is warranted when the urinary beta 2M/Cr ratio is high (> or = 0.13)."

An excretory urography and a urethrocystography were done for all the children. The frequency of functional and anatomical abnormalities is given. The severity grade of UTI was determined according to the classification of Elo and Stenström. Almost all episodes of UTI among boys occurred during the first three years of life and were mostly severe. After the 3rd year of life the occurrence of UTI among the boys was sporadic. Among the girls the severe episodes dominates during the first three years of life, but after that the episodes tended to become milder in character becoming mostly asymptomatic. The peak of asymptomatic episodes among girls was at 10 years of age. After that age the number of episodes dropped abruptly. The classification used, based on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and on white blood cell count (WBC), has shown to be useful and makes it possible to differentiate between renal (pyelonephritic) episodes and the lower tract episodes."

CD009185,0,2893330,0,Unsuspected urological anomalies in asymptomatic cryptorchid boys.,"In a period of 6 years 144 asymptomatic boys with cryptorchidism, of mean age 7 +/- SD 3.5 years, underwent orchiopexy. None of these boys referred to a history of a known urological anomaly, urinary tract infection, haematuria, palpable mass in the renal region, bladder extrophy, epispadias, hypospadias or anorectal malformation. On the third day after orchiopexy and intravenous pyelography was done in every boy following testicular protection against irradiation. Ultrasonic investigation was not available at that time. There were minor urological abnormalities in 36 (25%) boys and major ones in 8 (5.5%) boys. A major anomaly is defined as one resulting in significant loss of renal substance (one case of single kidney and three cases of unilateral renal hypoplasia), or requiring surgical correction for conservation of the renal substance (one case of ureterocele, two cases of pelviureteric stenosis and one case of vesicoureteric stenosis with ipsilateral hydronephrosis). The unsuspected major urological abnormalities are usually ipsilateral to the more undescended testis. They may be associated with a hernia and are more frequent in bilateral cryptorchidism. In conclusion we encourage the routine use of IVP, or ultrasonic investigation or dynamic renal scanning (99mTc-DTPA), if it is possible, in all patients undergoing orchiopexy for the detection of an unsuspected major renal anomaly."

It has not received focussed attention in non-traumatic neurological disorders. In a prospective study of 377 patients, on medical problems in neurological rehabilitation setting, 15 subjects (3.97%) had neurogenic heterotopic ossification. Their clinical diagnosis was: transverse myelitis (7), neurotuberculosis (4), traumatic myelopathy (2) and stroke (2). Hip (10), knee (4) and elbow joints (1) were involved. The risk factors included urinary tract infection (15), spasticity (6), pressure sores (13) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (6). The initial diagnosis was often other than HO and included DVT (3), haematoma (2) and arthritis (2). ESR and serum alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated in all but one subject. The diagnosis of HO was established using X-rays, CT Scan and three-phase bone scan. Following treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the range of motion improved in only four patients. HO resulted in significant loss of therapy time during rehabilitation. High index of suspicion about this complication is necessary for early diagnosis and prompt intervention."

IV Difficulties of level diagnosis and the possible relation to the character of infecting bacteria.,"As no method for localization of urinary tract infection has been shown to be absolutely reliable, six methods have been run parallelly in a study of 60 school girls with asymptomatic bacteriuria caused by E. coli. A poor correlation was obtained between ""high infection"" indicated by bladder washout test and abnormal findings of C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, antibody titres or renal concentrating capacity, while findings of parenchymal reduction on the pyelogram and reflux on the urethrocystogram were often found within this group. The low frequency of abnormal findings of C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate and renal concentrating capacity in girls with a ""high infection"" may be explained by the finding that the ABU patients were infected with changed E. coli strains probably not able to cause the usual inflammatory reactions. The patients' bacteria were found to be less efficient in providing antigen for antibody determinations than were standard strains of same O group, indicating a difference between strains from ABU patients and standard strains. From the battery of tests used it seemed that most of the girls had a bladder infection. All tests were normal in 48% of the patients while at least three of the methods were abnormal in 12%."
CD009185,0,19588169,0,Can prompt treatment of childhood UTI prevent kidney scarring?,"The aim of the study reported here was to determine whether kidney scarring after urinary tract infections (UTI) in children can be prevented and to identify the risk factors for developing scars. We identified children in the Northern health region of the UK who had been seen to develop scars, identified as new defects on dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scanning. Risk factors were sought by reviewing case-notes and interviews with parents. Twenty girls were identified whose new scarring was strongly associated with having both vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and a UTI (p = 0.0001); 19/23 (83%) of kidneys exposed to both of these factors developed scars. Children were much more likely to be febrile (94 vs. 30%, p < 0.0001) or unwell (82 vs. 10%, p < 0.0001) during their earlier UTIs when they were of median age 2.8 years (range 0.3-5.0 years) and did not scar, compared to their later UTIs at age 7.3 years (1.2-12.5 years), when they did scar. However, most patients were treated within 1 day of their symptoms for their early UTIs, compared to a wait >or=7 days for later UTIs (p = 0.001). Being febrile or unwell during a UTI does not predict the development of scars, but prompt treatment appears to prevent scarring in children with VUR."

CD009185,0,8414754,0,Rational use of CT in acute pyelonephritis: findings and relationships with reflux.,"Enhanced renal CT scanners were performed in 38 children (82% girls) to rule out acute pyelonephritis. Patients were divided in 2 groups on the basis of clinical presentation and bacteriology data. In patients of group A (n = 16, preliminary study), upper urinary tract infection (UTI) was certain. CT confirmed the diagnosis in all but 3 patients (a 2-year-old child and 2 patients with UTI developed on prior obstruction). In subsequently studied patients of group B (n = 22), clinical findings or bacteriology data were negative or questionable. CT made the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in 11 patients. As well as DMSA scintigraphy, CT scanner can help to diagnose or to rule out upper UTIs in difficult cases. In all boys of both groups, ipsilateral vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) was found by subsequent voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) on the side of pyelonephritis. In girls, this correlation was shown in only 7 of the 25 kidneys with pyelonephritis. This result supports the hypothesis of a gender-dependent contamination. We believe that absence of radiologic reflux cannot exclude the possibility of bacterial crossings of ureteric meatus capable to lead to genuine upper UTIs."

CD009185,0,14685837,0,Resistive index in febrile urinary tract infections: predictive value of renal outcome.,"In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we measured intrarenal resistive index (RI). We evaluated its ability to predict renal involvement as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. In total 157 patients admitted to the pediatric department of the Sişli Etfal Hospital with clinical signs of febrile UTI were included in the study. The children were divided into groups according to their age at the time of ultrasonography (US). RI was measured from the renal arteries with Doppler US in the first 72 h in all 157 children. Renal involvement was assessed by (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the first 7 days after admission. The examination was repeated at least 6 months later if the first result was abnormal. All available patients with an abnormal scintigraphy underwent voiding cystourethrography 4-6 weeks after the acute infection. All patients with vesicoureteral reflux and scarred kidneys were excluded from the study. DMSA scintigraphy demonstrated abnormal changes in 114 of 157 children and was normal in the remaining 43 children. Of these 114 children, 104 underwent repeat scintigraphy, of whom 77 showed partially or totally reversible lesion(s). Of these 77 children, 17 children (22%) with vesicoureteral reflux were excluded. Thus, we compared the 43 children with lower UTI with the 60 children with definite acute pyelonephritis at admission. Kidneys with changes of acute pyelonephritis had a mean RI of 0.744+/-0.06 in infants, 0.745+/-0.03 in preschool children, and 0.733+/-0.09 in patients of school age with upper UTI. However, the mean RI was 0.703+/-0.06 in infants, 0.696+/-0.1 in preschool children, and 0.671+/-0.09 in school-aged patients with lower UTI. The mean RI values were significantly higher in patients with upper UTI ( P<0.001). There was a highly significant correlation between RI values and the severity of the renal lesion as ranked by DMSA scintigraphy ( P<0.001). When the cut-off RI value was 0.715, there was an 80% sensitivity and a 89% specificity for diagnosing upper UTI. Refluxing kidneys and scarred kidneys also had higher RI values. In conclusion, RI values were increased significantly in children with febrile UTI when renal parenchymal involvement (assessed by DMSA scintigraphy) was present. Our results also support the view that the children with high RI values are at a high risk of reflux, scarring, or both, which was frequently observed in febrile UTI. This might allow identification of patients at risk for severe renal lesions that require more aggressive therapy, investigation, and follow-up than those with lower UTI."

CD009185,0,11812710,0,Discitis associated with pregnancy and spinal anesthesia.,"Discitis (inflammation of the intervertebral disk) most commonly develops as a rare complication of bacterial infection or chemical or mechanical irritation during spine surgery (1) with a postoperative incidence of 1%-2.8% (2). It is also a complication of discography-the intradiscal injection of saline or contrast material (3). The incidence of postdiscography discitis is 1%-4% (3); no cases have been reported when prophylactic antibiotics have been used, supporting the theory of bacterial contamination (3). Although it is controversial whether discitis can be caused by an aseptic or infectious process, recent data suggest that persistent discitis is almost always bacterial (4). Honan et al. (5) reported 16 cases of spontaneous discitis and reviewed another 52 patients from the literature. In their series, patients tended to have one or more comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, vertebral fracture, or a preexisting spine injury. Spontaneous discitis has also been associated with advanced age, IV drug abuse, IV access contamination, urinary tract infection, and immunocompromised states (5,6). No cases of infectious discitis associated with pregnancy and spinal anesthesia have been reported in the English literature. Discitis presents as spasmodic pain in the back that may be referred to the hips or groin (7). The pain may radiate to the lower extremities. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually increased. Radiological changes in discitis include narrowing of the intervertebral disk space, vertebral sclerosis, and erosion of the end plates. The best diagnostic measure may be magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a combination of bone and gallium scanning (2). The mainstay for discitis treatment is pain control and antibiotics; surgical intervention is usually not required. Complications of discitis include intervertebral fusion, epidural abscess, and paralysis."

For how long and in what way should they be followed? From May 1989 to December 2006, we prospectively followed 1,795 pregnancies in which the foetal renal pelvis measured 4 mm or greater. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and renal ultrasound were performed on 1,315 infants at 6 weeks of age. Our study group comprised 208 (167 male) infants with normal VCUG findings who had a renal pelvis of 6-11 mm. We followed them for 1-17 years (mean 11 years). Medical and radiological records were reviewed to determine any urinary symptoms and final outcome. They underwent, on average, four further imaging tests. The renal dilatation had resolved by 24 months in approximately 70%. Urinary tract infection (UTI) developed in 16 (8%). Calyceal dilatation was more likely in those developing UTI (P=0.02). Twenty-two (10.6%) had a radiologically demonstrated urinary tract abnormality. Of the five who had renal scarring or severe obstruction, four became symptomatic. Most infants with mild postnatal renal dilatation can be investigated with only one further sonogram at 24 months of age. Mild postnatal renal dilatation is associated with subsequent UTI or renal tract abnormality in 18%. Severe renal abnormality occurred in 2.4%."

CD009185,0,7794724,0,Update on dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scanning in children with urinary tract infection.,"The dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan is a method for assessing kidney function. Indications for DMSA scanning in children with urinary tract infection (UTI), as well as timing, have changed. Pitfalls in interpreting DMSA scans include: (1) acute pyelonephritis (APN), (2) tubular dysfunction, (3) hypertension, (4) use of captopril in patients with renovascular hypertension and (5) duplex kidneys. Interpretation of DMSA scans in children with UTI vary according to timing and clinical setting. During the course of a febrile UTI a DMSA scan may reveal a normal kidney, APN or a non-functioning, small and/or ectopic kidney. In the absence of UTI (up to 6 months) in children with vesicoureteric reflux a DMSA scan may indicate a normal kidney, renal scarring (reflux nephropathy), occult duplex kidney and allows the progression of scarring and hypertrophy of normal areas of the kidney to be followed anatomically. The DMSA renal scan in now the most reliable test for the diagnosis of APN. The transient abnormalities due to APN can occur in normal or scarred kidneys. Lesions due to reflux nephropathy (defined as a defect in the renal outline or contraction of the whole kidney) are permanent. Intravenous urography reveals renal abnormalities later than the DMSA scan. If abnormalities are seen on a DMSA scan performed during the course of APN it is impossible to predict the outcome: they can progress to permanent scarring or heal completely. An abnormal DMSA scan during a febrile UTI allows the identification of children at risk of developing renal scars. These children should be carefully investigated, maintained on long-term quimioprophylaxis and followed."
CD009185,0,12848478,0,Radiologic evaluation of patients with renal infections.,"Although renal imaging is not indicated routinely in cases of uncomplicated renal infection, CT is a highly sensitive modality to diagnose and guide the management of patients with acute renal infection. CT is particularly useful in identifying complications of renal infection. Intravenous urography and US are limited to screening for urinary obstruction, renal calculi, and underlying anomalies. CT is also of value in establishing the diagnosis in equivocal cases, in evaluating high-risk patients, and in determining the nature and extent of disease. CT urography is increasingly performed as a comprehensive urinary tract imaging study. MRI may be performed when patients have contraindications to iodinated contrast material. Cortical scintigraphy is the preferred imaging study for the evaluation of children with acute pyelonephritis, although power Doppler US can be considered as a possible alternative. Recent limited studies using gadolinium-enhanced MRI have been shown to be valuable in the depiction of changes of acute pyelonephritis."

CD009185,0,7794723,0,The intravenous urogram in the detection and evaluation of renal damage following urinary tract infection.,"Intravenous urography (IVU) still provides the most comprehensive structural assessment of the urinary tract. In particular, the radiological renal appearances approximate closely to the morphology of the renal scarring of reflux nephropathy or chronic atrophic pyelonephritis. It also provides reproducible renal measurements for follow-up assessment of renal growth and scarring. It is now less often used for first-line investigation of the acute urinary tract infection (UTI) because the swelling accompanying acute renal involvement is less easily recognised than the areas of defective function demonstrated on 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) studies. Also IVU contributes a higher radiation dose when calculated for full IVU (dependent on the number of films exposed) and there is a slight risk of side effects from injected contrast media, reduced by using non-ionic compounds. Because of its value in confirming such a serious diagnosis as renal scarring, suspected on ultrasonography or DMSA scintigraphy, modification of the technique of IVU with adequate preparation and the use of a reduced number of films, or single films localised to the renal areas, should be considered. Expertise in the interpretation of IVU must also be maintained because of the ancillary information regarding bowel and bladder function, the spine and evidence of stones, pertinent to the management of children with UTI and renal scarring. IVU and DMSA study remain complementary investigations."

Imaging protocols in pediatric urinary tract infections are evolving. From strategies based on extensive investigations in all children younger than 7 years of age, we are slowly moving to imaging strategies focused on children at risk of developing renal damage and possibly long-term complications. The article provides an overview on urinary tract infections, their complications and the use of imaging in their management. The different imaging strategies in children with UTIs (including the recommendation of excluding from imaging certain groups of patients) still needs full evaluation. It is interesting to note, however, a slow move from wide use of cystography in all children with UTI, which has been standard practice for many years but was probably not based on solid scientific evidence, toward a more focused use of cystograms in specific groups of children."

Recommendations 6 through 10 address treatment, identifying trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as superior to amoxicillin and establishing the duration of treatment as seven to 14 days. Children should receive antimicrobial coverage until imaging studies have been completed. Recommendation 11 addresses imaging; all infants should undergo ultrasonography, and a lower tract study is strongly encouraged as well.

Renal parenchymal involvement was assessed by (99m )Tc-DMSA scintigraphy within 7 days of admission. The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis was confirmed only in patients with reversible lesions on scintigraphy. According to DMSA scan results, patients were divided into two groups, lower UTI or acute pyelonephritis. In acute pyelonephritis, serum PCT level was found to be significantly higher than it is in the lower UTI (p <0.001). Also, significantly higher serum proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) levels were detected in those with acute pyelonephritis than those with lower UTI (p <0.001).

CD009185,0,12536245,0,Radionuclide voiding patterns in children with vesicoureteral reflux.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate bladder function in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) by means of indirect radionuclide cystography (IRNC), and to investigate whether IRNC can identify those children with voiding dysfunction. The study enrolled 74 neurologically intact children, 14 boys and 60 girls aged 2-14 years, with VUR documented using contrast micturating cystourethrography as the initial method. In all patients, IRNC was performed using technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetate (DTPA). Based on the urodynamic findings, three groups were distinguished: a group with VUR and normal urodynamic findings ( n=27), a group with VUR and detrusor hyper-reflexia ( n=43) and a group with VUR and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( n=4). A control group comprised 64 healthy children, aged 2-13 years, without any symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction. The dynamics of bladder emptying were studied in the posterior view after intravenous injection of 37 MBq/10 kg b.w. DTPA, with acquisition of 90 2-s frames during voiding. The parameters evaluated were: voided urine volume (VV), bladder capacity, functional bladder capacity (FBC), residual urine, voiding time, average flow rate, peak flow rate (PFR) and ejection fraction (EF). With regard to the final urodynamic diagnosis, FBC, PFR and EF were found to be significant IRNC predictor variables using the logistic regression method. If abnormality on at least two of the three significant predictor variables was taken as the criterion of voiding dysfunction, the overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of IRNC in the detection of voiding dysfunction were 81%, 78% and 80%, respectively. Three radionuclide voiding patterns were detected in children with VUR: (1) a normal voiding pattern characterised by normal FBC with near-normal PFR and EF values, (2) a markedly reduced FBC with significantly reduced VV, PFR and EF values (in children with bladder instability), and (3) a higher bladder volume with a near-normal value for PFR and a slightly reduced or near-normal EF (in children with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia). This study confirmed the association between lower urinary tract dysfunction and congenital VUR. IRNC was found to be a simple, non-invasive method which allows reliable differentiation of voiding patterns in patients with VUR. IRNC can be used as a first-line method for screening in children with VUR to identify those with abnormal voiding patterns."

I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) accumulated at the site of the abnormal MDP uptake. The diagnosis of neuroblastoma or allied disorder was excluded on the basis of other investigations and further evaluation, suggesting that the MIBG uptake was a false-positive. Findings on clinical imaging, laboratory findings, Tc-99m DMSA imaging, sonography, and CT scanning were highly suggestive of acute focal pyelonephritis."
CD009185,0,23199564,0,"[Procalcitonin, a useful biomarker in pediatric urinary tract infection].","Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common sources of bacterial infections among young febrile children. Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) and vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) are important because of their association with renal scarring, sometimes leading to long-term complications. However, the gold standard examinations are either a DMSA scan for APN and scarring, or cystography for VUR, but both present limitations (feasibility, pain, cost, etc.). Procalcitonin, a reliable marker of bacterial infections, was demonstrated to be a good predictor of renal parenchymal involvement in the acute phase and in late renal scars, as well as of high-grade VUR. These findings need further broad validations and impact studies before being implemented into daily practice. However, procalcitonin may play a role in the complex and still debated picture of which examination should be performed after UTI in children."
CD009185,0,8479676,0,Scintigraphy and sonography in reflux nephropathy: a comparison.,"The evaluation of reflux nephropathy (RNP) is a major task in the following up of children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Adequate monitoring of RNP development depends on the frequent use of sonographical and scintigraphical examinations. In order to evaluate the accuracy of sonography in monitoring RNP 63 patients suffering from VUR (mean age: 8.8 years, range: newborn to 18 years, male:female = 19:44) were examined prospectively. We calculated renal size sonographically and compared our data to static and dynamic renographic findings. Our results showed a good correlation between relative DMSA uptake and sonographically estimated relative renal size (r = 0.95, P < 0.001), whereas not unexpectedly the correlation between relative kidney function and sonographically estimated renal size was poor (r = 0.83, P < 0.01). We therefore believe, that in monitoring children with VUR, sonography can offer accurate information on questions about renal size and renal parenchymal structure as well as pelvic distention. With very small kidneys as well as with kidneys showing severe dilatation and above all for evaluating renal function, scintigraphy proved to be the better method."

CD009185,0,6400077,0,[Acute cholecystitis].,"Acute cholecystitis is a non-rare disease, the incidence of which was increasing in the last years parallel to biliary lithiasis, which in 90% of cases is the first cause of such pathology. From the anatomopathological standpoint, we distinguish three types of acute cholecystitis: catarrhal, suppurative and gangrenous. The most frequently remarked symptom is ache at right hypochondrium. Only in 30% of cases cholecyst can be palpated, in form of ovoid mass; typical is the positiveness of Murphy's manoeuvre; constant is fever, but not subicterus. The introduction of new methods of ascertainment, exempt from any risks, simple to be performed and remarkably careful, made the diagnostics of acute cholecystites easier: parietal cholecystotomography, hepato-biliary scintigraphy, echotomography (first approach investigation), computerized axial tomography and laparoscopy almost always succeed in dispelling doubts. By using more than one of these investigations, a diagnostic accuracy, touching on 100%, can be reached. The differential diagnosis should be placed with: peptic ulcer, acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, gonococcus perihepatitis, virus hepatitis, acute pyelonephritis, right basal pneumonia. The complications an acute cholecystitis can occur are: perforation (localized, in free peritoneum or in a hollow organ), choleperitonaeum, necrosis of hepatic parenchyma, acute pancreatitis. Due to the possible arising of such complications, the mortality unfortunately is not indifferent (5%), especially in patients already weakened by other chronic diseases. Still discussed is the question as to when performing operation. In fact, there are three trends: intervention in immediate emergency, in postponed emergency, or in remote time (preceded by a medical treatment). The Authors prefer the intervention in postponed emergency, as, in their experience, they remarked the poor effectiveness of the delay medical treatment, also involving a greater difficulty in the technical execution of the intervention and a longer stay in hospital. From 1973 up to 1983, 241 cases of acute cholecystitis (158 women and 83 men) were hospitalized at the First Aid Surgical Centre of the Catania University. Eight patients refused the surgical intervention. The remaining 233 underwent, depending upon the seriousness of the affection, the associated diseases and the different reactiveness to the medical treatment, operation: in immediate emergency (26.1%); in postponed emergency (67.8%; in remote time (6.1%). The mortality was 2.2%, with the lowest percentage in the second group."

CD009185,0,16036893,0,Does antenatal pelvic dilation predict renal scarring?,"Moderate antenatal renal pelvic dilation (5-15 mm) may suggest vesicoureteric reflux, but it is not known to predict renal scarring. Dimercaptosuccinic acid scans on such children aged over 4 years showed a scarring rate (0/133 boys, 1/56 girls) similar to our local population. Investigation and treatment of moderate dilation may not be required."
CD009185,0,8659016,0,Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for renal stones in children.,"The aim of our study is to determine the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) as a method of treatment of nephrolithiasis in childhood. Between 1986 and 1994, 50 children with renal calculi were treated by ESWL in our department. The age of the children ranged from 8 months to 14 years. Thirty-three of them were boys and 17 girls. The stone location was in the renal pelvis in 38 cases, in the upper renal calyx in 4 cases, in the lower calyx in 2, while 6 children had staghorn calculi. The stone size ranged between 3 and 39 mm. All treatments were performed with Dornier HM4 except 12 children, all older than 10 years, who underwent ESWL with Dornier HM3. All ESWL procedures took place under general anesthesia or sedation with ketamine. The number of shock waves varied between 400 and 2,000 per treatment and the standard maximum generator voltage was 18 kV. The overall stone clearance rate at 1 month was 66%. Fourteen children with large residual fragments underwent a second ESWL procedure 3 months later. With a mean follow-up of 33 months, 41 children (82%) are stone-free. Ten children developed urinary tract infection and 5 Steinstrasse. Twelve children had a pre- and post-ESWL DMSA scan and no permanent impairment of renal function was observed. We conclude that ESWL is the treatment of choice for urinary tract lithiasis in childhood. It is a low-risk method, without serious complications, which yields as high a success rate in children as in adults. We believe that as the stone fragmentation and clearance is much higher in children that in adults, the method must be the initial approach and may be the monotherapy even in staghorn or complex stones."

CD009185,0,8692483,0,A review of renal scarring in children.,"It is now widely accepted that children with a proven urinary tract infection should undergo some form of diagnostic imaging to assess the presence of, or the potential to develop, renal scarring. The type of investigation which should be performed is controversial. Some centres still perform intravenous urography, others rely on ultrasound alone, while others believe that a 99Tc(m)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tc(m)-DMSA) scan is essential. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques by drawing from the extensive literature currently available. The consensus view is that a DMSA scan is the most sensitive method of detecting renal scarring and of highlighting the kidney at risk of developing scarring. It is hoped that wider early use of DMSA scintigraphy will lead to a fall in the number of children who develop end-stage renal disease."
CD009185,0,10588267,0,Imaging of renal scarring.,"Children with urinary tract infection should be investigated and followed up, as those with pyelonephritis may develop renal scarring. In this review, after discussing the advantages and disadvantages of various imaging modalities for diagnosis of renal scarring, it is concluded that DMSA scintigraphy and urography can both be used to detect significant renal scarring. With DMSA scintigraphy, small renal lesions (functional uptake defects) not seen at urography will also be detected. The long-term clinical significance of these lesions is, as yet, unknown. A normal DMSA scintigraphy after infection indicates low risk for clinically significant damage. In order to allow acute, reversible lesions to first disappear, a follow-up DMSA examination should not be performed until at least 6 mo after the acute infection. Ultrasonography in isolation cannot be recommended for the diagnosis of renal scarring."
CD009185,0,704508,0,Urography in children: when should it be done? 1. Infection.,"Radiologic evaluation of urinary tract infection in children should include both excretory urography and voiding cystourethrography. Excretory urography is done to search for anomalies predisposing to infection and for signs of previous episodes of pyelonephritis or reflux and to serve as a baseline for future studies. Voiding cystourethrography is done to search for abnormalities in the natural barriers that protect the renal medulla from infection. If reflux is found to be present and sequential reflux studies are done, they should be performed by the radionuclide method to observe changes in degree or cessation."
CD009185,0,9695664,0,Assessment of infective urinary tract disorders.,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children, particularly in the youngest age groups. There is a risk for progressive deterioration of renal function in these children if aggravating factors such as gross reflux and/or outflow obstruction of the urinary tract are present. In this review the pros and cons of available scintigraphic and radiological imaging techniques for the work-up of these children are presented. Ultrasound can be used in the acute phase to exclude obstruction but can not reliably show transient or permanent parenchymal lesions. The presence of reflux can be established with X-ray or direct nuclide cystography. The X-ray technique gives good morphological information and has a grading system with prognostic relevance. Both techniques are invasive and great care must be taken to keep the radiation burden down with the X-ray technique. Indirect nuclide cystography following a renographic study is non-invasive but has a lower sensitivity than direct techniques. More experience is needed with the indirect technique to evaluate the consequences of its apparently low sensitivity. Urography has a limited place in the acute work-up of urinary tract infection but can be used to look for renal scarring 1-2 years after an acute pyelonephritis. The 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan can be used during the acute UTI to show pyelonephritic lesions with good accuracy and/or during the follow-up after six months to show permanent lesions. The acute DMSA scan can be omitted. An early treatment is more important than an early scan!"
