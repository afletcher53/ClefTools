CD009647,0,19535188,0,Forced euvolemic diuresis with mannitol and furosemide for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with CKD undergoing coronary angiography: a randomized controlled trial.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy is common in patients with coronary angiography. Mechanistically, forced euvolemic diuresis with mannitol and furosemide ought to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. Our objectives are to: (1) undertake a randomized trial testing this hypothesis, and (2) conduct a meta-analysis of our findings with 2 earlier studies."

CD009647,0,2146289,0,Sodium lauryl sulfate-induced irritant contact dermatitis in vulvar and forearm skin of premenopausal and postmenopausal women.,"Reactivity of the skin of the forearm and labia majora to three concentrations (2%, 3%, 5%) of sodium lauryl sulfate was studied in 20 healthy women, 10 premenopausal and 10 postmenopausal. Patches with the irritant were applied on day 0 for 24 hours. Skin changes were monitored by visual scoring and by the measurement of transepidermal water loss and capacitance as indicators of stratum corneum hydration on days 2, 3, 7, and 10. In forearm skin, irritant dermatitis developed in the majority of subjects as indicated by visual scoring and increase of transepidermal water loss. These changes were not significantly dependent on the concentration of sodium lauryl sulfate. In labia majora skin, irritant dermatitis developed in 50% of the women as determined by visual scoring; however, because of the pigmentation, visual scoring readings were less reliable in labia majora skin. Transepidermal water loss did not increase, but a significant and immediate decrease in capacitance was noted in labia majora skin. In forearm skin, postmenopausal women reacted less frequently and more slowly to sodium lauryl sulfate than premenopausal women whereas no age-related differences were observed in reaction of the vulvar skin. It is concluded that labia majora skin is not more reactive to sodium lauryl sulfate than forearm skin and that capacitance is more sensitive than transepidermal water loss in monitoring vulvar irritant dermatitis. Age-related differences in irritant reaction are apparent in the forearm, but not the vulva."

CD009647,0,10875734,0,Influence of cardiopulmonary bypass temperature on circulatory pathophysiology and clinical outcomes.,"This study was designed to investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) perfusion temperature. Forty-four patients who had undergone elective coronary bypass surgery were randomly divided into 2 groups (22 patients each) according to their perfusion temperature (N group=36 degrees C; L group=30 degrees C). The concentrations of endogenous catecholamines, complements, elastase, serotonin, arachidonic acid metabolites and endothelin underwent various changes throughout the CPB but did not exhibit any statistical differences in either group. None of the substances measured correlated with systemic vascular resistance at any time. The temperature of the perfusion appears to be a major determinant of vascular tone. The postoperative PO2 was better, and postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance lower in the N group (p<0.05), most likely because of a much larger water balance during hypothermic CPB (p<0.01). The postoperative blood loss was statistically less in the N group (p<0.05). Although apparent brain damage, evidenced by the leakage of creatine kinase-BB, was not seen, the jugular bulb venous hemoglobin saturation levels (<50% in 27% of the N group, p<0.05) and higher lactate levels suggested that normothermic perfusion was relatively disadvantageous. It is concluded that normothermic CPB was relatively safe and advantageous with regard to hemostasis and pulmonary function."
CD009647,0,18204249,0,Why is there significant overlap in volume status between hypertensive and normotensive patients on dialysis?,"Volume overload is believed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in dialysis patients. Although the extracellular water (ECW) content in hypertensive dialysis patients was significantly higher than in normotensive dialysis patients on the whole, there was considerable overlap in ECW between the two groups. Little is known about the hemodynamic characteristics in subgroups of patients with normotension but a high volume (HV) status or with hypertension but a normal volume (NV) status. We investigate the overlap in ECW between controlled and uncontrolled hypertension in dialysis patients."
CD009647,0,2996099,0,The effects of volume loading during epidural analgesia.,"We have determined the effects of volume loading on the cardiovascular changes during epidural analgesia in 37 patients, who underwent various kinds of surgery. The patients were placed in 4 groups, depending upon the level of analgesia and utilization of volume loading with colloidal solutions. If the analgesia extended above Th4 we grouped them as ""high epidural"" and lower than Th5 level they were grouped as ""low epidural"". The cardiac output was measured through a Swan-Ganz catheter with thermo-dilution methods and cardiovascular variables were calculated by standard formulas. Under epidural block the most significant changes were a fall in blood pressure with decrease in cardiac output which were more pronounced during high epidural analgesia. Volume loading during the induction period with colloidal solutions would prevent the marked fall of blood pressure in half of cases studied, but in the other half the infusion was not effective for the prevention of fall in blood pressure. On every occasion over-loading effects on the right side of the heart were observed with the infusion of colloidal solutions. Also, a marked fall in systemic vascular resistance was observed with the infusion. In consequence the volume loading did not prevent the fall in arterial pressure. To manage the latter which was observed during epidural block, some sympathomimetic agents would be necessary with the volume loading. This approach would be much more important in patients with dehydration and high level of epidural analgesia."

CD009647,0,1198637,0,"Cerebrospinal fluid and arterial lactate, pyruvate and acid-base balance in patients with intracranial hemorrhages.","Lactate and pyruvate concentrations and acid-base balance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and arterial blood were determined in patients with intracranial hemorrhages (28 subarachnoid hemorrhages and 15 intracerebral hemorrhages). A greater increase in CSF lactate and lactate-pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) was observed in patients with impairment of consciousness, focal neurological deficits, poor prognosis, or CSF pressures higher than 300 mm H2O. A combination of CSF lactate greater than 2.5 mM per liter, L/P ration above 20, bicarbonate less than 20.4 mEq per liter, pH below 7.276, or arterial PCO2 below 31.5 mm Hg seems to indicate poor prognosis from intracranial hemorrhage. The mechanism of hyperventilation in acute cerebrovascular diseases and of CSF pH regulation in acid-base disturbances was also discussed."
CD009647,0,15875128,0,Risk factors for prolonged ICU stay in patients following coronary artery bypass grafting with a long duration of cardiopulmonary bypass.,Risk factors for prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have been reported in many previous studies. However few have focused on circulatory and respiratory status as immediate postoperative risk factors. Therefore we examined immediate postoperative risk factors for prolonged ICU stay after CABG with a long duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

CD009647,0,2437838,0,[Transurethral resection using glycine irrigation].,"An accident is described which occurred during a transurethral resection of a prostatic adenoma using a 1.5% glycine solution in a 68 yr old patient. The surgery was performed under spinal anaesthesia with bupivacaine. After 14 l of irrigation fluid had been used, visual disturbances, bilateral mydriasis and drowsiness appeared, with no haemodynamic disturbances. Three hours after the end of surgery, there appeared convulsions, with the blood sodium level at 118 mmol X l-1. Symptomatic treatment resolved the problem, and the clinical examination was normal 12 h after surgery. The role of hyponatraemia in the clinical state is discussed. The usefulness of regional anaesthesia in the early detection of this type of accident is recalled."
CD009647,0,3442956,0,The value of Swan-Ganz catheterization and volume loading in preventing renal failure in patients undergoing abdominal aneurysmectomy.,"A prospective analysis of 61 patients undergoing abdominal aneurysmectomy is presented. When compared with 87 historical controls we have shown that the incidence of hypotensive episodes (31 out of 62 patients in the original study compared with 13 out of 44 patients in the prospective analysis) is significantly reduced when fluid balance is monitored invasively using the pulmonary artery wedge pressure and keeping it at 10 mm H2O (p less than 0.03). Renal dysfunction, defined as a significant drop in urine output and a doubling of the serum creatinine, occurred in only 10% of patients compared with 33% in the controls (p less than 0.001). The decreased prevalence of renal failure accounts for the reduction in mortality noted (p less than 0.01). There were 27 deaths (31%) amongst the patients in the earlier study compared with 9 (15%) in the prospective analysis. The pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for the development of renal failure following surgical manipulation of the abdominal aorta are reviewed."
CD009647,0,8850214,0,Food intake and body composition in cancer cachexia.,"As a complex syndrome, cachexia has different clinical manifestations; anorexia appears to be one of the most frequent findings, together with weight loss. Anorexia is the cause and partly the consequence of metabolic changes and of progressive undernourishment. In cancer cachexia, weight loss is associated with a marked decrease of food intake and severe alteration of body composition. Malnourished cancer patients show a marked loss of adipose tissue and protein mass with BIA evidence of decreased body cell mass and expansion of extracellular water. The mechanisms of anorexia and cachexia are still a matter of debate, but the possible involvement of cytokines in the pathogenesis of this syndrome has opened up new possibilities for its understanding and treatment. As a result of the multifactorial etiology of cancer cachexia/anorexia, therapies that stimulate appetite and promote greater food intake, coupled with factors that influence metabolism and cytokine production may be an optimal therapeutic strategy. Of particular interest appears to be the possible role played by fish oil in antagonizing the negative effects of cytokines. Future research in this field will help clinicians develop new methods to treat patients who have disease-induced starvation and wasting."
CD009647,0,8909935,0,Measurement of total body water by bioelectrical impedance in chronic renal failure.,"Abnormalities of body hydration are common in patients with advanced chronic renal failure (CRF) and may be associated with important adverse clinical effects, even in the absence of clinical features of fluid retention or depletion. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a simple, non-invasive method of measuring body water content and thus could be of use in the management and study of patients with CRF. This study was performed to assess the ability of BIA to measure total body water (TBW) in patients with CRF."
CD009647,0,1280013,0,Ethanol monitoring of transurethral prostatic resection during inhaled anesthesia.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the precision of a method of breath-alcohol analysis used to monitor absorption of irrigating fluid during transurethral resection of the prostate performed under inhaled anesthesia. A breath-alcohol analyzer (Alcolmeter SD-2) was placed between the endotracheal tube and the Bains' circuit. The concentration of ethanol in the breath, serum sodium concentration, and volumetric fluid balance were measured at 10-min intervals during 38 operations when the irrigating fluid contained 1.5% glycine and 1% ethanol. Ethanol monitoring detected absorption rates that exceeded 14 +/- 8 mL/min (mean +/- SD). In 17 patients in whom hyponatremia developed immediately in connection with absorption, the volume of irrigating fluid absorbed (up to 1950 mL) could be predicted from a single expired-breath test with a standard error of 325 mL. When the alcohol measurements were corrected for absorption time, the standard error was 215 mL. Seven other patients received 2.2% wt/vol glycine as irrigating fluid, and ethanol (0.35 g/kg) was administered by intravenous infusion. The direct and indirect measurements of the blood-alcohol concentration agreed well. These results confirm that ethanol monitoring is a viable technique during inhaled anesthesia for transurethral resection of the prostate."
CD009647,0,6450733,0,Cardiothoracic ratio as a guide to ultrafiltration therapy in dialyzed patients.,This study evaluated the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) and the roentgenologic heart volume (RHV) as indexes of body fluid retention in 37 uremics on maintenance dialysis therapy. Both indexes related to a highly significant degree with the variations of body fluids balance assessed by the changes in body weights. Cardiomegaly (CTR greater than .500) subsided with adequate ultrafiltration therapy in most patients including those having blood pressure values within the normal range. It is concluded that the measurements of CTR provides an useful guide to ultrafiltration therapy especially in those patients whose blood pressure fails to sense the body fluid retention.
CD009647,0,3767535,0,Diagnostic tests in the evaluation of dementia. A prospective study of 200 elderly outpatients.,"We studied the components of the diagnostic evaluation in 200 patients older than 60 years of age with suspected dementia who received standardized diagnostic evaluation and follow-up. The most common dementia diagnoses were Alzheimer's-type dementia (74.5%) and dementia due to toxic effects of drugs (9.5%). Eleven patients with hypothyroidism, metabolic encephalopathies due to hyponatremia, hyperparathyroidism, and hypoglycemia required laboratory tests for diagnosis, whereas the other dementia diagnoses were made primarily on the basis of data available on the history and physical and neurologic examinations. The complete blood cell count, blood chemistry battery (especially sodium, calcium, and glucose concentrations), and thyroid function tests were of definite value for the diagnosis of unsuspected disease and were useful as routine tests in evaluating patients for dementia. A careful history and physical examination accompanied by complete blood cell count, chemistry battery, and a thyroid function test would have been effective in diagnosing treatable illnesses causing cognitive impairment. Other diagnostic tests could have been used selectively based on results of the examination and screening tests. Estimated diagnostic charges from a selective approach would be 25% to 34% of those for the ""routine"" evaluation."
CD009647,0,2184655,0,Long-term effects of indapamide: final results of a two-year Italian multicenter study in systemic hypertension.,"To evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a low-dose diuretic, indapamide, 2.5 mg once daily, was given to 248 patients with uncomplicated, mild to moderate hypertension for a period of 24 months. Blood pressure during sitting was 165 +/- 1/105 +/- 1 mmHg (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at the end of the placebo run-in period and 143 +/- 1/88 +/- 1 and 140 +/- 1/85 +/- 1 mmHg after 2 and 24 months, respectively; heart rate was clinically unmodified (from 77 +/- 1 to 75 +/- 1 beats/min). Total cholesterol, high-density cholesterol and serum triglycerides were unchanged, and uric acid increased significantly (from 292.0 +/- 6.5 to 377.7 +/- 56.5 mumols/liter). A mild reduction in serum potassium (-0.36 +/- 0.03 mmol/liter) was observed after 2 and 6 months of therapy; however, the degree of reduction appeared to be lower than that from reported studies with other thiazide diuretics. The incidence of hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.5 mmol/liter) was highest in northern Italy (17%), intermediate in the central region (14%) and lowest in southern Italy (2%), although the absolute reduction in serum potassium was similar in all the geographic areas. Blood glucose tolerance was unchanged despite the changes in serum potassium. The tolerability was good on the whole, with a tendency toward an improvement in the well-being of patients, most of whom were already asymptomatic before starting the study."

CD009647,0,6326629,0,Correction of dilutional hyponatremia in severe chronic heart failure by converting-enzyme inhibition.,"To determine the effects of vasodilator and inotropic therapy on hyponatremia in patients with severe heart failure, we measured serum sodium concentration before and after treatment with captopril (70 patients), hydralazine (42 patients), prazosin (22 patients), and amrinone (19 patients), while diuretic dosages were kept constant. Serum sodium concentration increased only in hyponatremic patients treated with captopril (131.2 +/- 0.5 to 135.9 +/- 0. 5 SE ; p less than 0.001), but not during therapy with the other agents and not in patients with normal serum sodium concentration before treatment. Serum sodium began to rise 48 hours after the initiation of captopril therapy and reached its peak after 14 to 16 days. Correction of hyponatremia was related to functional interference with the renin-angiotensin system, but not to changes in renal function, serum potassium concentration, body weight, or the magnitude of hemodynamic or clinical improvement. These findings support experimental evidence that the renin-angiotensin system is important in the pathogenesis of hyponatremia in patients with severe heart failure treated with diuretics."
CD009647,0,3687569,1,Altered water excretion in healthy elderly men.,"The renal and vasopressin (AVP) response to a standard oral water load (20 ml/kg) was examined in a group of water-replete healthy elderly men (n = 6). Two groups, respectively, of water-replete and water-deprived young healthy volunteers acted as controls. After 2 h, the old group had excreted 41 +/- 2.4% (mean +/- SEM) of the water load compared to 100.7 +/- 8.8% in the water-replete young group and 70 +/- 3.8% in the water-deprived young group (P less than 0.01). Similarly, peak diuresis (7.01 +/- 0.48 ml/kg) and peak free-water clearance (5.7 +/- 0.48 ml/min) as determined from hourly sampling in the old group were delayed and significantly less than both young groups (P less than 0.01) (peak diuresis, young water-replete, 10.86 +/- 0.56 ml/kg, young water-deprived, 10.2 +/- 0.64 ml/kg, peak free-water clearance, young water-replete 8.4 +/- 0.72 ml/min, young water-deprived 9.5 +/- 0.88 ml/min). When these indices were adjusted for reduced creatinine clearance (Ccr) in the elderly, there was no significant difference between the young and old groups. Plasma AVP decreased similarly in all three groups following ingestion of water but there was no significant difference in mean plasma AVP between the young and old subjects throughout the study period. We therefore conclude that ability to excrete excess water promptly is impaired in healthy elderly men. This defect is due, at least in part, to an age-related reduction in glomerular filtration rate."
CD009647,0,11574736,0,Changes in heart rate variability in chronic uremic patients during ultrafiltration and hemodialysis.,"The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is a useful tool to evaluate cardiac autonomic modulation, which is frequently impaired in chronic uremia."
CD009647,0,22773526,0,How do sock ply changes affect residual-limb fluid volume in people with transtibial amputation?,"The purpose of this research was to investigate the influence of sock addition and removal on residual-limb fluid volume in people using prosthetic limbs. We used bioimpedance analysis to measure residual-limb extracellular fluid volume on 28 transtibial amputee subjects during 30 min test sessions. Upon addition of a one-ply polyester sock, residual-limb fluid volume changes ranged from -4.0% to 0.8% (mean -0.9 +/- 1.3%) of the initial limb fluid volume. Changes for sock removal ranged from -1.2% to 2.8% (mean 0.5 +/- 0.8%). Subjects who reduced in fluid volume with both addition and removal of a sock and subjects with high positive ratios between the fluid-volume loss upon sock addition and gain upon sock removal (high add/remove [AR] ratios) tended to have arterial disease, were obese, and were smokers. Subjects with low positive AR ratios, subjects who increased in fluid volume both with sock addition and removal, and a single subject who increased in fluid volume with sock addition and decreased with sock removal tended to be nonsmokers and either individuals in good health without complications or individuals without arterial problems. Results are relevant for the anticipation of limb volume changes during prosthetic fitting and toward the design of adjustable-socket technologies."
CD009647,0,1320823,0,Plasma alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide concentration in patients with acute lung injury.,"To elucidate the pathophysiologic role of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-hANP) in acute lung injury, plasma alpha-hANP concentrations were measured in 15 patients with severe lung injury, and the relationships of plasma alpha-hANP levels to the severity of lung injury, diuresis/natriuresis, and fluid balance were examined. The mean concentrations of plasma alpha-hANP (188.0 +/- 94.6 pg/ml) in patients with severe lung injury at the entry into the study were significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than those in normal subjects (31.7 +/- 12.0 pg/ml). Plasma alpha-hANP levels decreased in parallel with the improvement of lung injury in nine of 15 patients, whereas they changed little, if any, in the patients who did not recover. Plasma alpha-hANP concentrations correlated positively with urine volume, urinary sodium excretion, and excreted fraction of filtered sodium, but they correlated negatively with fluid balance at the onset of the disease as well as during the clinical course. It is suggested that elevation of circulatory alpha-hANP may reflect an adaptative mechanism to remove excessive fluid retention and reduce pulmonary hypertension for acute lung injury."
CD009647,0,2677101,0,"The effect of dietary salt ingestion on blood pressure of old-old subjects. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.","To study the effect of dietary salt restriction and supplementation on blood pressure of elderly subjects, we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial. Seven healthy subjects living in a long-term care facility, with a mean age of 85 and normal to borderline-hypertensive blood pressures, completed a 16-week protocol. During the double-blind cycles, subjects consumed either a low sodium (43 mmol/day) or a high sodium diet (175 mmol/day) for four weeks supplemented with placebo or salt capsules, with crossover to the other diet. Sitting diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower during the low sodium diet (69.86 mmHg +/- 3.80 vs 78.71 mmHg +/- 3.99, P less than .01), with all subjects showing decreases. Supine plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone were significantly lower during the high sodium diet. Both low and high sodium diets were well-tolerated by subjects. Symptomatic postural hypotension and hyponatremia were not observed. We conclude that old-old subjects with borderline hypertension demonstrate salt-dependent increases in blood pressure. Without additional supportive studies, however, these results should not be generalized to any specific cohort of elderly individuals."
CD009647,0,15782993,0,Renal failure in obstructive jaundice.,The optimal preoperative management of patients with acute obstructive jaundice is still a matter of debate. Reduction in effective plasma volume and systemic endotoxemia are major consequences both in experimental acute bile duct ligation and in patients with acute obstructive jaundice (AOJ). The objective of this study is to show the necessity for adequate preoperative hydration and lactulose administration for the prevention of postoperative renal dysfunction in patients with AOJ.
CD009647,0,9284731,0,"The importance of growth hormone in the regulation of erythropoiesis, red cell mass, and plasma volume in adults with growth hormone deficiency.","Total body water (TBW) is reduced in adult GH deficiency (GHD) largely due to a reduction of extracellular water. It is unknown whether total blood volume (TBV) contributes to the reduced extracellular water in GHD. GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) have been demonstrated to stimulate erythropoiesis in vitro, in animal models, and in growing children. Whether GH has a regulatory effect on red cell mass (RCM) in adults is not known. We analyzed body composition by bioelectrical impedance and used standard radionuclide dilution methods to measure RCM and plasma volume (PV) along with measuring full blood count, ferritin, vitamin B12, red cell folate, IGF-I, IGF-binding protein-3, and erythropoietin in 13 adult patients with GHD as part of a 3-month, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of GH (0.036 U/kg.day). TBW and lean body mass significantly increased by 2.5 +/- 0.53 kg (mean +/- SEM; P < 0.004) and 3.4 +/- 0.73 kg (P < 0.004), respectively, and fat mass significantly decreased by 2.4 +/- 0.32 kg (P < 0.001) in the GH-treated group. The baseline RCM of all patients with GHD was lower than the predicted normal values (1635 +/- 108 vs. 1850 +/- 104 mL; P < 0.002). GH significantly increased RCM, PV, and TBV by 183 +/- 43 (P < 0.006), 350 +/- 117 (P < 0.03), and 515 +/- 109 (P < 0.004) mL, respectively. The red cell count increased by 0.36 +/- 0.116 x 10(12)/L (P < 0.03) with a decrease in ferritin levels by 39.1 +/- 4.84 micrograms/L (P < 0.001) after GH treatment. Serum IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3 concentrations increased by 3.0 +/- 0.43 (P < 0.001) and 1.3 +/- 0.15 (P < 0.001) SD, respectively, but the erythropoietin concentration was unchanged after GH treatment. No significant changes in body composition or blood volume were recorded in the placebo group. Significant positive correlations could be established between changes in TBW and TBV, lean body mass and TBV (r = 0.78; P < 0.04 and r = 0.77; P < 0.04, respectively), and a significant negative correlation existed between changes in fat mass and changes in TBV in the GH-treated group (r = -0.95; P < 0.02). We conclude that 1) erythropoiesis is impaired in GHD; 2) GH stimulates erythropoiesis in adult GHD; and 3) GH increases PV and TBV, which may contribute to the increased exercise performance seen in these patients."
CD009647,0,1519324,0,In vitro storage and in vivo survival studies of red cells from persons with the In(Lu) gene.,"Red cells (RBCs) of individuals with the In(Lu) gene are characterized by suppression of the Lutheran, P1, i, and other blood group antigens, acanthocytosis, and abnormal electrolyte metabolism. To determine the clinical significance of these abnormalities, the survival of autologous RBCs was determined by 51Cr in two siblings with the dominant Lu(a-b-) [In(Lu)] phenotype. Both subjects studied had normal hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, and ferritin values. RBC indices were mildly hypochromic. Examination of the peripheral smear showed mild acanthocytosis in one individual. Analysis of RBC distribution on discontinuous density gradients showed a shift to lighter fractions than normal control RBCs. Storage of these Lu (a-b-) RBCs at 4 degrees C showed significant hemolysis within a few days; this was confirmed by increased autohemolysis, which was reduced by glucose and ATP. RBC cation content (sodium and potassium) was higher than that in control cells, which indicated increased cell hydration, which explains the lighter density and mild hypochromia of the Lu(a-b-) RBCs. 51Cr survival of autologous Lu(a-b-) RBCs was normal in both subjects studied. The data indicate that the morphologic and cation abnormalities of RBCs of persons with the In(Lu) gene are clinically insignificant, as these cells have normal in vivo survival. Such RBCs, however, are susceptible to increased hemolysis in vitro under standard blood banking storage conditions. Individuals of the Lu(a-b-) phenotype, associated with In(Lu), may not be suitable candidates for routine blood donation."
CD009647,0,3835223,0,Evaluation of impedance technique for fluid-volume monitoring during hemodialysis.,Fluid-volume changes during hemodialysis were studied in 30 patients at four separate treatments in each patient. Readings of fluid-volume changes obtained by a fluid-balance monitor with non-invasive tetrapolar impedance technique were compared to changes in weight caused by the treatment.

CD009647,0,17515276,0,Bilateral adrenal lymphoma with Addison's disease : a surgical pitfall.,"A 65 year old man presenting with abdominal and back pain was found to have bilateral adrenal masses. Phaeochromocytomas were initially suspected on the basis of increased catecholamine excretion. This diagnosis seemed unlikely in view of clinical findings and a negative 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. A biopsy of the right adrenal mass revealed a diagnosis of primary adrenal B-cell lymphoma. Hyponatraemia and subtle clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency led to a diagnosis of Addison's disease, a common complication of primary adrenal lymphoma. Thus, bilateral adrenal masses associated with Addison's disease should raise the suspicion of possible primary adrenal lymphoma."

CD009647,0,11199506,0,Effects of a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor on circulating blood volume after cardiopulmonary bypass.,"Using a new method based on pulse dye densitometry, circulating blood volume (BV) was measured without direct sampling in patients undergoing open-heart surgery, and the effects of phosphodiesterase (PDE) III inhibitor administration during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were evaluated. Sixteen patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly assigned to the PDE III inhibitor group or control group. BV was determined before CPB, and immediately, and 4 and 12h after operation. After declamping of the aorta, the PDE III inhibitor amrinone (1 mg/kg) was infused as a single bolus into the venous reservoir in the PDE III inhibitor group. BV decreased significantly soon after the operation in the control group. It did not decrease in the PDE III inhibitor group (48.6 +/- 44 and 60.6 +/- 8.0 ml/kg for the control and PDE III inhibitor groups. respectively). Four hours after surgery and beyond no significant changes in BV were observed in either group. The body fluid balance was negative in both groups. In conclusion, a single administration of PDE III inhibitor during CPB was found to sustain BV soon after operation and, therefore, is useful for postoperative management of open-heart surgery."

CD009647,0,2234267,0,[Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration in acute renal insufficiency].,"A fully pump-assisted continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration system (CVVHDF) was studied in 10 acute renal failure patients. A counter current pump system ensured slow dialysis at a mean flow rate of 24.6 +/- 0.6 ml/min (single pass) and guaranteed recovery of 97% of dialysate. Ultrafiltration rates were controlled by a separate occlusive pump, connected to the dialysate compartment. Blood was circulated by mean of a third pump at flow rates ranging form 100 to 150 ml/min. Mean duration of CVVHDF was 197 +/- 32 h (range 96-336). Mean serum creatinine and urea before initiation of CVVHDF were 525 +/- 52 mumol/l and 36 +/- 14 mmol/l and stabilized after 4-7 days of CVVHDF at 280 +/- 27 mumol/l and 14 +/- 3 mmol/l. Hemodynamic parameters remained stable. Glucose and phosphate removal by CVVHDF was 296 +/- 42 mmol/day and 33 +/- 6 mmol/day respectively. Fractional losses of aminoacids given by parenteral nutriton averaged 8 +/- 1%. An 69 filters induced no significant changes in leucocyte and thrombocyte counts and only a slight decrease in pO2 (-0.78 +/- 0.30 K Pa at 60 min). We conclude that CVVHDF is a safe, efficient and reliable treatment modality, allowing a good control of the fluid balance."

CD009647,0,7653796,0,[Continuous breath alcohol analysis. Monitoring of irrigation absorption syndrome in transurethral prostate resection].,"The absorption of large volumes of irrigation fluid is a major problem in transurethral prostatic surgery (TUR-P). Various indicators have been tested to monitor fluid absorption with regard to continuous registration and sufficient accuracy. The volumetric fluid balance is not suitable as a routine method because of its inaccuracy. Easily accessible parameters are unspecific because of surgical bleeding (haematocrit [Hct]), or are interfered with by physiological counter-regulatory actions (serum sodium [Na] concentration). In 1986 Hulten et al. suggested adding 2% ethanol to the irrigation fluid as a marker and investigated it intermittently in the expired air with an alcohol-test appliance. In a prospective clinical study of 17 patients undergoing TUR-P under spinal anaesthesia, expiratory concentrations of alcohol that was added to the irrigation fluid (2% ethanol in Purisole, Fresenius, Bad Homburg) were monitored. Gas was continuously sampled from the nasopharynx through a nasal cannula and the ethanol concentration was measured using a modified diverting anaesthetic gas monitor (Normac, Datex, Helsinki) that allows continuous as well as early detection of the absorbed irrigation fluid with reliable accuracy for clinical use. In addition, at intervals of 10 minutes we measured blood alcohol, end-tidal alcohol (Alcotest 7110, Dräger, Lübeck), haematocrit, serum Na concentration, and blood gases. Sixty-eight measurements were obtained from the 17 patients. As shown in other studies, serum Na (r2 = 0.68) and Hct (r2 = 0.39) correlated poorly with the irrigation fluid as determined by serum alcohol levels. In contrast, the expiratory alcohol measurements with the Alcotest 7110 (r2 = 0.93) and Normac devices (r2 = 0.85) were closely related. Continuous monitoring of the expiratory alcohol concentration with a Normac monitor closely reflects blood alcohol concentration, and may hence serve as a useful semiquantitative monitor of irrigation fluid absorption during TUR-P."

CD009647,0,1143086,0,Acute renal failure in multiple myeloma.,"1. The clinical manifestations, laboratory data and renal histologic features of acute renal failure occurring in 14 patients with multiple myeloma are reviewed and contrasted with the data from 29 previously reported cases. 2. Whereas other reports have stressed the role of intravenous pyelography and dehydration in the development of acute renal failure in multiple myeloma, the most common etiologic factor in our experience was hypercalcemia (7 patients). Other factors included potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics (3 patients) and volume depletion (2 patients). Intravenous pyelography could be clearly implicated in ony one patient. 3. The unusually high incidence of Bence Jones proteinuria in these patients is consistent with the possibility that Bence Jones protein excretion is associated with an increased susceptibility to renal injury. This could be due to an adverse effect of Bence Jones proteins on the renal tubules or their tendency to precipitate in tubular lumina during periods of reduced tubular flow. 4. The prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma who develop acute renal failure is poor; only 5 of our 14 patients survived the early period of acutely impaired renal function, and 4 of these subsequently died within 2 months. Preventive measures particularly the prompt correction of hypercalcemia and volume depletion, are the most important aspects of patient management."

This study retrospectively investigated eight patients with Rathke's cleft cyst manifesting as hyponatremia and treated surgically with histological confirmation to clarify the mechanism of hyponatremia. All patients suffered from physical symptoms caused by the hyponatremia. All patients underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and screening of pituitary hormones in addition to cortisol and thyroid hormones. All patients had cysts of more than 10 mm in diameter and MR imaging frequently showed irregularly thickened cyst wall. Histological examination disclosed various phases of inflammation and significant fibrosis. Endocrinological examination showed low concentrations of both serum cortisol in all eight patients and urinary cortisol in six of six patients examined. The major cause of hyponatremia was hypocortisolemia, induced by damage to the anterior pituitary gland."

CD009647,0,10432415,0,The urea [clearance x dialysis time] product (Kt) as an outcome-based measure of hemodialysis dose.,"The normalized treatment ratio [Kt/V = the ratio of the urea clearance x time product to total body water] and the urea reduction ratio (URR) have become widely accepted measures of dialysis dose. Both are related to and derived from pharmacokinetic models of blood urea concentration during the dialysis cycle. Theoretical reconsideration of the models revealed that the premise about V on which they rest (that is, that V is a passive diluent with no survival-associated properties of its own) is flawed if the intended use of the models is for profiling clinical outcome (for example, mortality) rather than estimating urea concentration. As a proxy for body mass, V has survival-associated properties of its own. Thus, indexing clearance x time to body size could create an offsetting combination whereby one measure favorably associated with survival (Kt) is divided by another (for example, V). Observed clinical paradoxes support that interpretation. For example, patients with a low body mass have both higher URR and higher mortality than heavier patients. Increasing mortality is often observed at high URR, suggesting the possibility of ""over-dialysis."" Black patients tend to be treated at lower URR than whites but enjoy better survival on dialysis. Therefore, clearance x time was evaluated as an outcome-based measure of dialysis dose, not indexed to V, and various body size estimates were evaluated as separate and distinct measures."

We have evaluated the efficacy and safety of a continuous technique (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration-CVVH) in 7 patients (1 male, 6 females, mean age 77 +/- 4 years) referred to our intermediate care unit for oliguria, acute renal failure and NYHA functional class IV, CVVH was performed by a peristaltic pump with blood flow at 200 ml/min, controlled ultrafiltration production rate (25 ml/min), minute to minute microprocessor controlled fluid balance system, biocompatible filters, low-dose prostacyclin for the extracorporeal circuit maintenance. Non invasive evaluation of cardiac function was performed by Doppler echocardiography. A total of 673 hours of CVVH were performed, with a mean extracorporeal circuit duration of 96 +/- 26 hours/patient (range 15-134). Daily urea clearance was 32 +/- 21. A mean body weight decrease of 10% was obtained (body weight before-CVVH 64.5 +/- 6 kg vs end-CVVH 58.5 +/- 5 kg, p < 0.01, paired data Student's test) without any hemodynamic worsening; metabolic control was adequate (urea before-CVVH 251 +/- 73 mg% vs end-CVVH 117 +/- 18 mg%, p < 0.01).

CD009647,0,2644753,0,The influence of thoracic epidural analgesia on transcapillary fluid balance in subcutaneous tissue. A study in patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery.,"Clinical observation and calculation of fluid balance have shown that patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in addition to general anesthesia retain less fluid than patients having general anesthesia only. The present study was designed to investigate whether this effect could be explained by thoracic epidural analgesia influencing the transcapillary fluid balance, i.e. the transcapillary forces (COPpl, COPif, Pif). Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure (COPif) and interstitial fluid pressure (Pif) were measured subcutaneously at heart level by the blister suction technique and the wick-in-needle technique, respectively. Simultaneously plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COPpl) was recorded. Sixteen male patients were allocated to two groups, one having general anesthesia only (controls, n = 8). The other group (TEA, n = 8) received, at the induction of anesthesia, bupivacaine 50 mg via an epidural catheter as an adjunct to general anesthesia. TEA was maintained by continuous infusion for 24 h postoperatively. Preoperatively no intergroup differences were observed in ""the Starling forces"" (COPpl, COPif, Pif). At the start of extracorporeal circulation COPpl was significantly lower in the TEA-group than in controls. During extracorporeal circulation the transcapillary COP-gradient (COPpl-COPif) was reversed in both groups. At the end of extracorporeal circulation Pif increased to a minor degree in the TEA-group and remained significantly lower than in controls from 3 to 24 h postoperatively. The subcutaneous interstitial tissue could be less expanded postoperatively in the TEA-group, also reflected by a lower increase in Pif."

CD009647,0,11086151,0,Can delirium relieve psychosis?,"A delirium presages a poor prognosis in hospitalized patients, but an incidental delirium is a feature of some psychiatric treatments. We report five cases in which delirium preceded the relief of affective and psychotic symptoms of a major mental illness. The experience stimulated a review of the literature on delirium in psychiatric treatments. Five inpatients (aged 53 to 69 years) with an exacerbation of chronic mental illness developed deliria from medications (n = 4) and electrolyte disturbance (n = 1). The deliria were managed with medication washout or correction of electrolyte imbalance. The progress of the patients was noted clinically and summarized. The clinical signs of delirium such as confusion, disorganized speech, sleep-wake cycle changes, and hallucinations persisted for 24 to 72 hours. As the delirium cleared, psychotic and affective symptoms improved or resolved. The improvements persisted for 1 to 5 months, with low doses of medications in two of the cases. A delirium may precede clinical improvement in affective and psychotic symptoms. Historically, some treatments for mental illness induce an incidental delirium (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy [ECT] and insulin coma). Why a delirium should presage a beneficial effect on psychosis is unclear, but the emergence of delirium may herald a beneficial pathophysiology."

One hundred and fifty-five patients were treated for 52 weeks. The daily dosages were 1 tablet (113 patients), 2 tablets (35 patients), 3 or 4 tablets (7 patients). Treatment was associated with a marked reduction in the prevalence of ankle oedema, dyspnoea and pulmonary crepitations, and with statistically significant decreases in body weight, pulse rate and calf measurement. Mean serum potassium showed a small but statistically significant increase, but serious hyperkalaemia was not encountered. Although serum sodium decreased, serious hyponatraemia did not occur. No clinically significant effects on hepatic, renal or haemopoietic function were observed. Minor adverse effects, most of which resolved spontaneously, were reported by 60 patients.

CD009647,0,21130956,0,[Hyponatremia: classification and differential diagnosis].,"Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance. This disorder is usually produced by water retention due to the patient's inability to balance water excretion with ingestion of liquids. The present article provides basic information on the physiopathology and epidemiology of hyponatremia in certain contexts such as the ambulatory and hospitalized settings, the geriatric population, exercise-induced hyponatremia, drug-induced hyponatremia and finally hyponatremia observed in some common diseases such as heart failure, liver cirrhosis, pneumonia and HIV infection. The differential diagnosis of hyponatremia should include plasma osmolality, which can be increased, normal or decreased. Most true hyponatremias are grouped in the latter category. If the extracellular volume is decreased, urinary sodium concentrations can be either low or normal with dehydration in the former and water retention in the latter. In hyponatremia with normal extracellular volume, there is free water retention due to a series of stimuli. This entity is seen mainly in hospitalized patients with hypothyroidism or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Hyponatremia is underdiagnosed and, more seriously, undertreated, despite numerous studies demonstrating its devastating effects on hospital admissions. The most useful laboratory tests for its diagnosis are urinary sodium concentration, plasma osmolality and urinary osmolality."
CD009647,0,16883123,0,Extravascular lung water and peripheral volume status in hemodialysis patients with and without a history of heart failure.,"Determining volume status in hemodialysis patients with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) is difficult. Extravascular lung water (EVLW) may be derived from blood ultrasound velocity changes following injections of 0.9% and 5% saline. Bioimpedance spectroscopy can measure total body water (TBW) and its intracellular fluid (ICF) and extracellular fluid (ECF) compartments. We studied 29 clinically euvolemic hemodialysis patients, 12 of whom had a history of CHF. The ECF and ICF were measured before dialysis, and EVLW was measured during dialysis. Values of EVLW were similar between patients without CHF and those with CHF (3.55 ml/kg +/- 0.94 SD versus 3.88 ml/kg +/- 0.82 SD, respectively; p = NS). The ECF/ICF ratio was higher among patients with a history of CHF (1.27 +/- 0.29) than among those without such a history (1.04 +/- 0.04; p < 0.05), indicating that ECF volume overload was present in both groups, but was higher in those with a CHF history. There was a positive correlation between EVLW and ECF/ICF ratios (r = 0.54, p < 0.01). Measurements of EVLW were higher in two pulmonary edema patients ((7.95 ml/kg and 5.95 ml/kg; p < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that 1) hemodialysis patients with a history of CHF have more ECF volume overloaded than those without such a history; 2) the degree of ECF expansion is associated with increasing EVLW volume, even in patients without pulmonary edema; and 3) ECF volume expansion eventually exceeds limits and pulmonary edema occurs. These developing technologies of volume measurement may be of value in this challenging clinical area."
CD009647,0,533409,0,Initial experiences with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.,"Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has been initiated on 51 patients: 27 females (mean age -- 43.9 years) and 24 males (mean age -- 46.4 years). This group has been observed for a total of 1420 patient weeks of treatment (27.3 patient years). Thirty-six episodes of peritonitis have been noted among 19 patients. The overall incidence was one episode per 39.4 patient weeks. Recurrent episodes of peritonitis resulted in discontinuation of CAPD in five (9.8%) of the patients. Three (5.9%) of the patients were unable to continue with CAPD because of its inability to control extracellular fluid balance. In the patients who transferred from intermittent peritoneal dialysis to CAPD, there was a 4.5 mg/dl drop in serum creatinine and a 34 mg/dl drop in mean BUN values. There was a rise of approximately 2 gm in the hemoglobin levels of this group of patients. If the problem of peritonitis can be solved, CAPD will become the dialytic treatment of choice for the majority of patients with end-stage renal disease."
CD009647,0,17171925,0,Effects of high-dose fentanyl on fluid and vasopressor requirements after cardiac surgery.,"The effects of two different anesthetic techniques on postoperative cardiopulmonary events, fluid and vasopressor requirements, and overall intensive care unit (ICU) course were studied in patients undergoing elective myocardial revascularization (CABG) (N = 20) or single cardiac valve replacement (N = 20). Patients were randomized to receive either high-dose fentanyl (F, 75 microg/kg followed by 0.3 microg/kg/min) or diazepam-ketamine (0.8 mg/kg D and 2 mg/kg K followed by 0.07 mg/kg/h D and 1 mg/kg/h K). No significant differences in preoperative demographics, prebypass hemodynamics, ischemic crossclamp, or total cardiopulmonary bypass times were noted. Patients receiving F had lower systemic arterial pressures and vascular resistances and required more vasopressors during the first 12 hours postoperatively. They also had a more positive cumulative fluid balance at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively, despite a higher incidence of postoperative diuretic use in CABG patients receiving F. Rectal temperature was significantly higher at four and eight hours postoperatively in F patients. Time until arousal and length of ICU stay were significantly greater with F, although duration of intubation did not differ between anesthetic techniques. Although the data does not provide an explanation for these differences, it indicates that these two techniques produce quite different physiologic responses in the postoperative period following cardiac surgery. In summary, it was found that F for cardiac surgery was accompanied by increased postoperative fluid and vasopressor requirements with increased Qsp/Qt and longer ICU stays compared to diazepam and ketamine. This study suggests that some anesthetic techniques may provide less complicated and less costly postoperative courses than others, with the same outcome after cardiac surgery. Information on the postoperative effects of long-acting anesthetic agents is sparse and more studies of these effects and their mechanisms are necessary because they may affect patient management after cardiac surgery."

With volume status change, the mitral E/A ratio showed a tendency to decrease, mitral E wave deceleration time decreased, isovolumic relaxation time increased, and the expiratory diameter of the inferior vena cava reduced and its inspiratory collapse increased. No significant correlation was observed between the parameters studied and volume changes, or between central venous pressure and fluid balance.

The authors report the case of a 75-year-old, previously fit, gentleman who presented with weight loss, lethargy and blackouts. He required four admissions to the hospital over an 8-month period. Investigations revealed persistent hyponatraemia consistent with a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, macrocytic anaemia and partial hypopituitarism. Unfortunately, all other investigations that were performed failed to identify the underlying cause and a diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma was only confirmed following postmortem studies. The authors recommend that endocrinologists should be involved at the outset in the management of patients with persistent hyponatraemia and that intravascular large B-cell lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hyponatraemia."

To determine the average and range of usual water intake, urine output, and total body water, we administered 2H oxide to 458 noninstitutionalized 40- to 79-yr-old adults living in temperate climates. Urine was collected in a subset of individuals (n = 280) to measure 24-h urine production using p-aminobenzoic acid to ensure complete collection. Preformed water intake was calculated from isotopic turnover and corrected for metabolic water and insensible water absorption from humidity. Preformed water intake, which is water from beverages and food moisture, averaged 3.0 l/day in men (range: 1.4-7.7 l/day) and 2.5 l/day in women (range: 1.2-4.6 l/day). Preformed water intake was lower in 70- to 79 (2.8 l/day)- than in 40- to 49-yr-old men and was lower in 70- to 79 (2.3 l/day)- than in 40- to 49- and 50- to 59-yr-old women. Urine production averaged 2.2 l/day in men (range: 0.6-4.9 l/day) and 2.2 l/day in women (0.9-6.0 l/day). There were no age-related differences in results in women, but 60- to 69-yr-old men had significantly higher urine output than 40- to 49- and 50- to 59-yr-old men. Only the 70- to 79-yr-old group included sufficient blacks for a racial analysis. Blacks in this age group showed significantly lower preformed water intake than did whites. Whites had significantly higher water turnover rates than blacks as well. Multivariate regression indicated that age, weight, height, and body mass index explained <12% of the gender-specific variance in water input or urine output, yet repeat measures indicated that within-individual coefficient of variation was 8% for preformed water intake (n = 22) and 9% for 24-h urine production (n = 222). These results demonstrate that water turnover is highly variable among individuals and that little of the variance is explained by anthropometric parameters."

CD009647,0,11348476,0,The effect of methoxsalen dose on ultraviolet-A-induced erythema.,"There is considerable interindividual variation in bioavailability of Methoxsalen (8-methoxypsoralen) after ingestion of the standard dose used in photochemotherapy (psoralen plus ultraviolet A). A dose change may be used to alter the degree of photosensitivity, although there is limited information on the effect of 8-methoxypsoralen dose alterations on phototoxicity within individuals. We studied the effect of changes of 8-methoxypsoralen dose over a narrow range in 15 subjects with psoriasis. Two hours after ingestion, serum 8-methoxypsoralen concentration was determined and phototesting was performed at 350 +/- 30 nm (0.45-14 J per cm2). The minimal phototoxic dose at 72 h was recorded, erythema was measured using a reflectance instrument, and dose-response curves were constructed. Each subject was tested on three occasions using doses of 25 mg per m2 (conventional dose) or conventional dose +/- 10 mg. Median serum 8-methoxypsoralen concentration increased from 96 to 143 to 229 ng per ml with dose increases from conventional dose - 10 mg to conventional dose and conventional dose + 10 mg, respectively (p < 0.001). The median minimal phototoxic dose and D0.025 (the objective equivalent of the minimal phototoxic dose derived from the dose-response curve) were significantly reduced with increasing 8-methoxypsoralen dose from conventional dose minus 10 mg (minimal phototoxic dose 1.7 J per cm2; D(0.025) 2.8 J per cm2) to conventional dose (1.2; 1.4 J per cm2) and conventional dose plus 10 mg (0.9; 1.0 J per cm2) (p < 0.001). Change in 8-methoxypsoralen dose had no detectable effect on the maximum slope of the psoralen plus ultraviolet A erythema dose-response curve. Thus, 8-methoxypsoralen dose changes within individuals, over a narrow but clinically relevant range, significantly altered the threshold response to psoralen plus ultraviolet A erythema but not the rate of increase in erythema with increasing ultraviolet A dose."
CD009647,0,16189620,0,Combination therapy with metolazone and loop diuretics in outpatients with refractory heart failure: an observational study and review of the literature.,"Metolazone is a potent thiazide-like diuretic. It is recommended in severe congestive heart failure (HF). We conducted a review of the existing literature and found that the available information on the use of metolazone in HF is based on studies containing less than 250 patients in total. Nevertheless, metolazone is widely used, often in combination with a loop diuretic. Absorption of metolazone seems to be reduced in HF. Metolazone produces a diuretic response despite a low glomerular filtration rate. A wide dose range of metolazone has been investigated (< or =2.5 to 200 mg), leaving no clear dosing recommendation. However, in most studies a low starting dose (< or =5 mg) was used. We further report an observational study on 21 patients with refractory systolic HF from our specialized outpatient HF clinic. The aim was to evaluate the effects of metolazone in combination with a loop diuretic in contemporary HF patients."

CD009647,0,8776557,0,Tear hyperosmolarity in renal dialysis patients asymptomatic for dry eye.,"Renal dialysis patients have hyperosmolar bodily fluids due to high urea levels, and accordingly their tears should be hyperosmolar. Tear hyperosmolarity is a sensitive and specific test for dry eye. The purpose of this study was to determine whether renal dialysis patients have hyperosmolar tears and dry eye. Ten renal dialysis patients completed the McMonnies and Ho dry eye questionnaire and underwent tear osmolarity testing before dialysis. Serum osmolarity was calculated from serum sodium, potassium, and blood urea nitrogen levels. Half of the subjects also participated in tear osmolarity testing after dialysis and underwent an eye examination that included rose bengal and fluorescein staining, Schirmer's testing, and tear break-up time testing. All of the subjects had both hyperosmolar serum and tears, and tear osmolarities were positive for dry eye in all subjects. However, none of the subjects tested positively for dry eye with the questionnaire. The subjects had some physical findings consistent with dry eye, and Schirmer's testing showed decreased tear production. Renal dialysis patients are a population that have hyperosmolar tears yet remain asymptomatic for dry eye. Urea has been used for years as a dermatologic treatment for dry skin. The high levels of urea in the tears of dialysis patients may protect them from developing dry eye. Tear hyperosmolarity due specifically to ionized solutes such as sodium and potassium is probably more pathogenic in causing dry eye than is hyperosmolarity in general. Nevertheless, tear osmolarity testing should not be used as a dry eye monitor in renal failure patients."

Concentration of S-AVP was unaffected by uncomplicated resection; irrigant absorption resulted in immediate increase in S-AVP concentration, but this increase could not explain the hypertension that occurred in some patients with absorption; a sudden decrease in the systolic arterial pressure was followed by a marked increase in S-AVP concentration; and extensive blood loss did not stimulate release of AVP, provided there was no associated arterial hypotension."
CD009647,0,22099512,0,Diuretic-associated hyponatremia.,"Soon after their introduction in 1957, thiazide diuretics became a recognized cause of hyponatremia. Thiazides may be the sole cause and they may exacerbate hyponatremia in patients with disorders that cause the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Although thiazides do not inhibit the ability to concentrate the urine, they impair diluting ability in several ways: inhibition of sodium and chloride transport at cortical diluting sites; stimulation of vasopressin release; reduction of glomerular filtration and enhanced proximal water reabsorption, which reduce delivery to the distal diluting sites; and, possibly, a direct effect on water flow in the collecting duct. Water retention caused by impaired water excretion combined with cation depletion may result in severe hyponatremia. Thiazides should be avoided in frail elderly patients with chronically high water intake or in others who depend on the excretion of maximally dilute urine to maintain fluid balance, such as patients with psychogenic polydipsia or heavy beer drinking. Inadvertent rapid correction of hyponatremia is common in thiazide-induced hyponatremia because the ability to dilute the urine is restored when the diuretic is discontinued and volume deficits are repaired. Hypokalemia, which often is present, increases the susceptibility to osmotic demyelination syndrome and replacement of potassium deficits contributes to the increase in serum sodium concentration."
CD009647,0,17515729,0,Effects of relative blood volume-controlled hemodialysis on blood pressure and volume status in hypertensive patients.,"In hypertensive hemodialysis (HD) patients, dry weight reduction to normalize blood pressure (BP) often results in increased frequency of HD hypotension. Because HD with blood volume tracking (BVT) has been shown to improve intra-HD hemodynamic stability, we performed a prospective, randomized study to test whether BVT is more effective than standard hemodialysis (SHD) in the management of hypertension by dry weight reduction. After a run-in period of 4 weeks on SHD, 28 patients were randomly assigned for a 12-week treatment period with either SHD (n = 14) or BVT (n = 14). The mean pre-HD and post-HD weight did not change over time in either group. In the BVT group, pre-HD systolic and diastolic BP decreased on average 22.5 mm Hg and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively (both p < 0.05), whereas BP did not change in the SHD group. Extracellular water and cardiothoracic ratio decreased significantly (all p < 0.05) in the BVT group but not in the SHD group. Brain natriuretic peptide levels declined only in the BVT group, without reaching statistical significance. The frequency of HD hypotensive episodes decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the BVT group and was unchanged in the SHD group. HD with BVT was associated with a significant reduction in pre-HD BP. At the same time, the frequency of intra-HD hypotensive episodes decreased. Although the mean weight did not change, the reductions in cardiothoracic ratio and extracellular water suggest that HD with BVT resulted in optimization of volume status."
CD009647,0,21329483,0,Management of diuretic treatment: a challenge in the obese patient.,"The obesity epidemic is a major health concern. The diagnosis of acute illness and fluid imbalance in the obese patient is complicated by a wide range of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and lymphoedema. Thus, obesity warrants particularly careful clinical and biochemical assessment owing to its resemblance to fluid retention. Dosing of diuretics is difficult in these patients. The blood urea:creatinine ratio should be widely used to detect emerging cardiovascular and renal complications. This report presents an obese patient with congestive heart failure due to a myocardial infarction, who subsequently was overdosed with diuretics. His prerenal acute renal failure resolved when diuretics were stopped and the high urea:creatinine ratio was diagnostic."
CD009647,0,9856828,0,Water and protein structure in photoaged and chronically aged skin.,"Changes in the structural proteins and hydration during aging is responsible for altered skin morphologic and mechanical properties manifested as wrinkling, sagging, loss of elasticity, or apparent dryness. To gain insight into the age-related alterations in protein conformation and water structure, we obtained Raman spectra from the sun-protected buttock skin representing chronologic aging and the sun-exposed forearm skin representing combined effects of photoaging and chronologic aging. Ten aged individuals (five men, five women; age range 74-87) and 10 control young individuals (five men, five women; age range 22-29) entered the study. In the photoaged forearm skin the positions of protein-specific amide I, amide III, and CH stretching bands were shifted, suggesting increased protein folding. In contrast, major changes were seen only in the amide I peak in chronologically aged skin. The intensity of the 3250 cm(-1) OH stretching band was increased in photoaged skin (but not in chronologically aged skin) indicating an increased water content. R(v) representation of the low-frequency region of Raman spectra was applied to determine water structure. In the young skin and chronologically aged skin water was mostly present in the bound form. In the photoaged skin, however, an increase in intensity at 180 cm(-1) was noted, which reflects an increase in the not-protein bound water (tetrahedron water clusters). In conclusion, it seems that proteins in the photoaged skin are more compact and interact with water to limited degree. Impairment in protein hydration may add to the understanding of ultrastructural, mechanical, and biochemical changes in structural proteins in the aged skin."

CD009647,0,3476801,0,"Effects of aging on vasopressin secretion, water excretion, and thirst in man.","Disorders of water balance are common among elderly patients. A number of factors may contribute. Osmoreceptor-mediated release of AVP is increased, but the response to volume stimuli may be reduced. The capacity of the kidney to concentrate urine is reduced by age, but this impairment cannot be correlated with coincident loss of glomerular filtration (GFR); there may rather be a failure of cAMP response to AVP in aging kidneys. Free water clearance is reduced in the old in proportion to the loss of GFR. Thirst mechanisms are also significantly impaired in healthy as well as sick old people. This combination of factors renders old people particularly liable to develop disorders of water homeostasis during episodes of acute or chronic ill health."
CD009647,0,17515725,0,Amiloride-sensitive sodium channels on the parietal human peritoneum: evidence by ussing-type chamber experiments.,"The mesothelium is part of the peritoneal water and ion transport barrier essential for peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment and has a central role in the pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis and ultrafiltration failure observed in many PD patients. We investigated the effect of amiloride on the transmesothelial electrical resistance (RTM) of isolated parietal human peritoneum. Intact sheets were obtained from seven patients (three men, four women; mean age, 64 +/- 8 years). Fourteen peritoneal planar sheets were transferred to the laboratory in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution at 4 degrees C within 30 minutes after removal and mounted in an Ussing-type chamber. Amiloride (10(-3) mol/L) added apically (n = 8) caused a rapid rise of the RTM to 24.15 +/- 0.76 [OMEGA]H cm2 and a subsequent value persistence (p < 0.05); added basolaterally (n = 6), it increased the RTM to 22.66 +/- 0.59 [OMEGA]H cm2 within 1 minute, which persisted throughout the experiment. RTM was measured before and serially for 30 minutes after addition of amiloride. Control RTM was 20.29 +/- 0.86 [OMEGA]H cm2. These results indicate a rapid inhibitory effect of amiloride on the ionic permeability of parietal human peritoneum. The increase in the RTM observed after addition of amiloride clearly indicates the existence of amiloride-sensitive sodium channels on the human parietal peritoneal membrane, which may play some role in the ultrafiltration process and sodium removal during PD."

CD009647,0,22684643,0,Treatment of chronic kidney disease in the elderly: diet or conservative management.,"The elderly constitute the fastest-growing group of patients reaching end-stage renal disease and requiring renal replacement therapy. In this group of patients renal failure is only one of the many comorbidities affecting them, and for the nephrologist the decision whether to commence renal replacement therapy when patients present multiple comorbidity is a challenge. In fact, many elderly patients with severe comorbidity have a poor prognosis once dialysis is started, and a conservative management or a low protein diet can be less harmful. Information on survival of elderly patients on these therapies is limited, but in the last years a large body of literature has been published in this field. Rates of dialysis withdrawal are highest among the oldest patients, raising the possibility that the standard information given to patients for dialysis warrant an age-sensitive approach. For the elderly, the information should include risk, benefit and burden associated with dialysis, age-specific estimates of prognosis with dialysis or with conservative management, and potential for loss of independence and decline in functional status and cognitive impairment. Dialysis can impair quality of life of the elderly, and when decision makers choose a treatment they have to keep in mind that specialists should add life to years, and not years to life. When a ""no dialysis"" option is chosen, an active renal disease management as treatment of anemia, acidosis, fluid balance, hypertension, and active end of life care is required. This approach requires devoted attention from patients, families and caregivers, and a multidisciplinary approach."
CD009647,0,2937761,0,A retrospective evaluation of the medical treatment of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia.,"Little is known about the relative effectiveness and potency of a variety of treatments for malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, or how beneficial the reversal of hypercalcemia is to these patients. Therefore, 146 trials of treatment for hypercalcemia between 1980 and 1983 at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, were evaluated retrospectively. Serum calcium levels exhibited the largest decrease in the mithramycin-treated group (decrease; 5.4 +/- 1.8 mg/dl, mean +/- SD, n = 22), followed by the groups given calcitonin plus glucocorticoids (3.1 +/- 2.3, n = 11), glucocorticoids (2.3 +/- 2.3, n = 18), calcitonin (1.8 +/- 1.6, n = 51), hydration (1.3 +/- 2.5, n = 27), and indomethacin (1.0 +/- 2.3, n = 17). The effective rate was the highest with mithramycin (100%) and then with calcitonin plus glucocorticoids (73%) and with glucocorticoids (61%); it was less than 50% in the other modalities of treatment. In patients with pretreatment serum calcium levels of 14 mg/dl or more, the survival rate improved significantly in those whose serum calcium levels decreased below 12 mg/dl compared with those whose serum calcium remained above 12 mg/dl (50% survival; 35 vs. 9 days, P less than 0.01). These data provide a good guideline and a rationale in choosing the modality of treatment. In addition, the data show that the gain in the survival time achieved by successful treatment of hypercalcemia is clinically significant, because it is long enough to conduct additional antitumor therapy."
CD009647,0,3246774,0,Acute mesenteric ischemia.,"Acute mesenteric ischemia is becoming an increasing cause of death in old patients with generalized atherosclerosis. Pathogenetically, this condition presents as poor splanchnic perfusion, with or without occlusion of the major visceral vessels. Because the patient manifests such nondescript abdominal pain and the physical examination reveals few abdominal signs, it is therefore extremely difficult to make an accurate diagnosis in the early stage of the disease. Furthermore, laboratory studies and X-ray examinations are usually noncontributory. It is therefore necessary to keep this lesion in mind, whenever examining the old patient with severe unexplained abdominal pain. Selective arteriography is essential for differentiating occlusive ischemia from non-occlusive, however, the recent advances in medical imaging and minute flowmetry make it possible to detect intestinal lesions and the state of visceral perfusion, transcutaneously, in the early stage of the disease. Emergency revascularization is mandatory for an occlusive lesion, but it is not indicated in the early stage of non-occlusive disease, and requires support of cardiac failure, hypovolemia, septic shock and lowered splanchnic perfusion."
CD009647,0,18655905,0,Prevention of hypoxic brain oedema by the administration of vasopressin receptor antagonist OPC-31260.,"The numerous situations which can result in cerebral hypoxic damage occur in newborn infants and in the elderly. In research aimed at more effective therapeutic intervention in ischaemic disorders of the brain, the animal model used and the principles of the causal therapy should be better outlined. The effects of the non-peptide AVPR (V2) antagonist 5-dimethylamino-1-[4-(2-methylbenzoylamino) benzoyl]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine hydrochloride (OPC-31260) on the cerebral oedema induced by general cerebral hypoxia were studied in rats. The general cerebral hypoxia was produced by bilateral common carotid ligation in Sprague-Dawley rats of the CFY strain. By 6h after the ligation, half of the rats had died, but the survival rate was significantly higher following OPC-31260 administration. Electron microscopic examinations revealed typical ischaemic changes after the carotid ligation, and OPC-31260 treatment did not significantly reduce the hypoxic signs in the brain cortex; only a certain decrease in the pericapillary oedema was observed. The carotid ligation increased the brain contents of water and Na(+) and enhanced the plasma AVP level. The increased brain water and Na(+) accumulation was prevented by OPC-31260 administration, but the plasma AVP level was further enhanced by OPC-31260. These results demonstrate the important role of AVP in the development of the disturbances in brain water and electrolyte balance in response to general cerebral hypoxia. The carotid ligation-induced cerebral oedema was significantly reduced following oral OPC-31260 administration. The protective mechanism exerted by OPC-31260 stems from its influence on the renal AVPR (V2). These observations might suggest an effective approach to the treatment of global hypoxia-induced cerebral oedema in humans."

We measured plasma ANP and BNP levels and performed Doppler echocardiography in 38 anuric patients before and after HD. Patients with valvular disease, left ventricular systolic dysfunction having a fractional shortening < 0.3, arrhythmia, or left ventricular hypertrophy were excluded. The relationships between plasma ANP or BNP levels and the transmitral flow velocity pattern were evaluated. We also determined if the magnitude of the decrease in plasma ANP level was related to that in the early peak of transmitral flow velocity (peak E). The mean age of the subjects was 61.1 +/- 9.7 years. The ANP level of 213.6 +/- 146.1 pg/mL was related to peak E of 61 +/- 15 cm/s before HD (R = 0.504, P < 0.001), but not after HD. Plasma ANP level was not related to peak late transmitral flow velocity (peak A) or peak E/peak A before or after HD. BNP level was not related to the transmitral flow velocity pattern. The magnitude of decrease in hANP level during HD was significantly related to that in peak E (R = 0.342, P < 0.05). Before HD, peak E was related to the plasma ANP level, reflecting volume overload. Change in peak E showed a weak relationship with that of plasma ANP level in the same HD patient. The measurement of peak E during a HD session may potentially enable the assessment of hydration status during HD."

Standard solutions for peritoneal dialysis are administered in a single-pass manner countercurrent to the blood flow. To control the dialysate flow through the filter, two separate pumps designed for intravenous infusion are used. Anticoagulation is achieved by means of continuous heparin infusion. This three-pump system is effective in controlling the fluid balance and the level of azotemia. Furthermore, this system makes haemodialysis possible in spite of severe haemodynamic instability.

Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors."

CD009647,0,22649067,0,Assessment of body cell mass at bedside in critically ill patients.,"Critical illness affects body composition profoundly, especially body cell mass (BCM). BCM loss reflects lean tissue wasting and could be a nutritional marker in critically ill patients. However, BCM assessment with usual isotopic or tracer methods is impractical in intensive care units (ICUs). We aimed to modelize the BCM of critically ill patients using variables available at bedside. Fat-free mass (FFM), bone mineral (Mo), and extracellular water (ECW) of 49 critically ill patients were measured prospectively by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and multifrequency bioimpedance. BCM was estimated according to the four-compartment cellular level: BCM = FFM - (ECW/0.98) - (0.73 × Mo). Variables that might influence the BCM were assessed, and multivariable analysis using fractional polynomials was conducted to determine the relations between BCM and these data. Bootstrap resampling was then used to estimate the most stable model predicting BCM. BCM was 22.7 ± 5.4 kg. The most frequent model included height (cm), leg circumference (cm), weight shift (Δ) between ICU admission and body composition assessment (kg), and trunk length (cm) as a linear function: BCM (kg) = 0.266 × height + 0.287 × leg circumference + 0.305 × Δweight - 0.406 × trunk length - 13.52. The fraction of variance explained by this model (adjusted r(2)) was 46%. Including bioelectrical impedance analysis variables in the model did not improve BCM prediction. In summary, our results suggest that BCM can be estimated at bedside, with an error lower than ±20% in 90% subjects, on the basis of static (height, trunk length), less stable (leg circumference), and dynamic biometric variables (Δweight) for critically ill patients."
CD009647,0,11694945,0,Tumor lysis syndrome.,"Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a constellation of metabolic disturbances observed in tumors with high cell turnover. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. TLS is characterized by the increased release of intracellular contents (uric acid, potassium, phosphorus) into the extracellular compartment, which can overwhelm the body's capacity for clearance. TLS is usually caused by response to chemotherapy; however, it may also occur spontaneously. Because uric acid, potassium, and phosphorus are excreted primarily by the kidneys, TLS can lead to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia with accompanying renal compromise. The pathophysiology of TLS-associated acute renal failure is probably multifactorial. Potential etiologies include intravascular volume depletion, urinary precipitation of nucleic acid metabolites and calcium phosphate, and malignancy-associated nephrotoxins. Despite prophylactic therapy with allopurinol and volume repletion, patients may still develop TLS with acute renal failure. While reducing the risk of uric acid precipitation, allopurinol and alkalinization increase the risk of xanthine and calcium phosphate crystals, respectively. Aggressive hydration might lead to volume overload, specifically in older patients. Novel approaches in the management of TLS include the use of urate oxidase, which can provide effective treatment with an acceptable safety profile."

CD009647,0,1559513,0,Use of multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis for the estimation of extracellular fluid.,"Thomasset (Lyon Medicine (1962): 207, 107-118; (1963): 209, 1325-1350; (1965): 214, 131-143) and others suggested that low-frequency impedance measurements could be used to estimate extracellular fluid and that high-frequency measurements could be used for the assessment of total body water. It was the purpose of this study to examine the relationship between body fluid compartments and multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA). Total body water (TBW) and extracellular fluid (ECF) were measured using deuterium and sodium bromide dilution procedures. Intracellular fluid volume (ICF) was calculated as the difference between TBW and ECF. A tetrapolar arrangement of surface electrodes was used to measure whole-body resistance (R), reactance (Xc), impedance (Z), and phase angle (P) at 25 frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to 1.35 MHz. Subjects (n = 60; 40 male and 20 female) were between the ages of 19 and 65 years. Mean ratios (+/- SEM) of ECF/ICF and ECF/TBW were 0.83 +/- 0.021 and 0.45 +/- 0.011, respectively. Individuals with the largest fat-free mass (FFM) had the highest ECF value. Whole-body resistive index values most correlated to ECF were at 224, 300, 400, 548 and 1 kHz with correlations ranging from 0.93 to 0.84. All possible subset regression analysis was used to develop a prediction equation for ECF: R2 = 0.924 and SEE = 1.061: ECF = 5.17753 + (0.09989*RI224) + (0.09322*WT) - (1.3962*SEX), where RI = resistive index (HT2/R) at the specific frequency of 224kHz; WT = weight in kilograms; sex was dummy-coded, males = 0, females = 1."
CD009647,0,11086840,0,Studies on poly(propylene fumarate-co-ethylene glycol) based bone cement.,"Poly(propylene fumarate-co-ethylene glycol) random (PPF-1) and block (PPF-2) copolymer oligomers were prepared. Comparing the setting characteristics of PPF-1 and PPF-2 with comonomer n-vinyl pyrrolidone (n-VP) and swelling characteristics of cured PPF-1 and PPF-2, lower setting temperature and setting time was observed with the former leading to higher swelling coefficient and lower cross link density in the cured PPF-1. Due to the high swelling coefficient and low setting exothermic temperature associated with PPF-1, the bone cement was prepared from PPF-1, n-VP and hydroxyapatite (HAP). The in vitro degradation studies reveal lesser weight loss and deformation of PPF-1/n-VP/HAP based cured resin in Ringer's solution and phosphate buffered saline in comparison with that of PPF-1/n-VP cured resin. Though the bone cement composite has adequate mechanical properties with HAP, the compressive strength and modulus of the composite aged in Ringer's solution and PBS reduced appreciably which is due to extensive hydration and plasticization by the PEG unit. However, the bone-binding and bond strength of the bone cement determined as the load for separation of bones was found to be similar to that of fast setting calcium phosphate-atelocollagen (5%) bone cement. The bone cement PPF-1/n-VP/HAP could be used as scaffold for correcting the bone defects."

CD009647,0,16611719,0,Early changes in bioelectrical estimates of body composition in chronic kidney disease.,"The aim of this study was to detect the potential occurrence of early abnormalities of body composition in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at first referral to an outpatient nephrology clinic. Eighty-four patients with CKD (49 men and 35 women) were compared with 604 healthy control subjects (298 men and 306 women). Anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) were performed in all participants, whereas renal function, laboratory tests for nutritional status, and nutrient intake were assessed in the CKD group only. Creatinine clearance was 27.8 +/- 13.8 and 27.4 +/- 13.0 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in male and female patients with CKD, respectively. No patient showed peripheral edema; frank malnutrition, defined by presence of serum albumin <3.5 g/dl plus body mass index <20 kg/m(2); or protein intake <0.6 g/kg per d. At the BIA, patients with CKD showed lower resistance (R) and abnormal mean impedance vectors for the bivariate normal distribution of R/height and reactance/height. Phase angle also was reduced (-22%), especially in patients with diabetes. When BIA-derived data were considered, total body water was slightly higher (+4.3% in men; +3.5% in women) and body cell mass was lower (-6.7% in men; -7.7% in women) in patients with CKD. No difference in either BIA parameters or nutritional indexes was observed among various CKD stages. Despite the absence of overt malnutrition, patients with CKD exhibit altered BIA variables from the early phases of renal disease. These alterations are related to the renal dysfunction, are more marked in the presence of diabetes, and mainly indicate the presence of overhydration in the absence of edema. Therefore, BIA represents an attractive clinical tool to detect impairment of body composition from the early stages of CKD."

CD009647,0,10919961,0,Fluid and electrolyte supplementation for exercise heat stress.,"During exercise in the heat, sweat output often exceeds water intake, resulting in a body water deficit (hypohydration) and electrolyte losses. Because daily water losses can be substantial, persons need to emphasize drinking during exercise as well as at meals. For persons consuming a normal diet, electrolyte supplementation is not warranted except perhaps during the first few days of heat exposure. Aerobic exercise is likely to be adversely affected by heat stress and hypohydration; the warmer the climate the greater the potential for performance decrements. Hypohydration increases heat storage and reduces a person's ability to tolerate heat strain. The increased heat storage is mediated by a lower sweating rate (evaporative heat loss) and reduced skin blood flow (dry heat loss) for a given core temperature. Heat-acclimated persons need to pay particular attention to fluid replacement because heat acclimation increases sweat losses, and hypohydration negates the thermoregulatory advantages conferred by acclimation. It has been suggested that hyperhydration (increased total body water) may reduce physiologic strain during exercise heat stress, but data supporting that notion are not robust. Research is recommended for 3 populations with fluid and electrolyte balance problems: older adults, cystic fibrosis patients, and persons with spinal cord injuries."

The commercial availability of DHEA outside the regular pharmaceutical-medical network in the United States creates a real public health problem that may be resolved only by appropriate long-term clinical trials in elderly men and women. Two hundred and eighty healthy individuals (women and men 60-79 years old) were given DHEA, 50 mg, or placebo, orally, daily for a year in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. No potentially harmful accumulation of DHEAS and active steroids was recorded. Besides the reestablishment of a ""young"" concentration of DHEAS, a small increase of testosterone and estradiol was noted, particularly in women, and may be involved in the significantly demonstrated physiological-clinical manifestations here reported. Bone turnover improved selectively in women >70 years old, as assessed by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) technique and the decrease of osteoclastic activity. A significant increase in most libido parameters was also found in these older women. Improvement of the skin status was observed, particularly in women, in terms of hydration, epidermal thickness, sebum production, and pigmentation. A number of biological indices confirmed the lack of harmful consequences of this 50 mg/day DHEA administration over one year, also indicating that this kind of replacement therapy normalized some effects of aging, but does not create ""supermen/women"" (doping)."

CD009647,0,10390382,0,Right heart catheterization in acute lung injury: an observational study.,"Right heart catheterization (RHC) is commonly used in the diagnosis and management of acute lung injury (ALI). However, controversy exists regarding RHC. We examined RHC use during the first 3 d of ALI in an observational study of 135 patients defined by American-European Consensus Conference criteria. Study parameters examined for association with RHC included the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score, lung injury score (LIS), and 20 additional epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. RHC was performed in 70 patients (52%) within the first 3 d of ALI. RHC was positively associated (p < 0.05) with a diagnosis of sepsis, APACHE III score, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, net fluid balance, and positive end-expiratory pressure. RHC was negatively associated (p < 0.05) with mean arterial pressure (Pa) and PaO2/FIO2. Logistic regression identified four predictors for RHC placement: sepsis, PaO2/FIO2, BUN, and Pa. Initial right atrial and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure measurements demonstrated a moderately strong correlation (r = 0.72). Use of RHC was associated with a change in one or more therapeutic interventions (intravascular fluids, vasopressors, diuretics) in 78% of patients. In summary, patients receiving RHC during the first 3 d of ALI were more severely ill than those who did not receive RHC, and RHC was associated with a change in therapy in most patients."

CD009647,0,9049613,0,Aging and human heat tolerance.,"Collectively, the literature on heat tolerance suggests that middle-aged (45- to 64-year-old) men and women are more work-heat-intolerant and suffer more physiological strain during heat acclimation than younger individuals. However, it is unclear whether the age differences in work-heat intolerance and physiological strain during heat acclimation are related to age per se or associated with other factors such as certain disease states, decreased physical activity, or lowered aerobic fitness. In contrast, the work-heat tolerance and physiological responses during heat acclimation of habitually active or aerobically trained middle-aged men are the same as or better than younger individuals. The reviewed studies emphasize the importance of aerobic fitness and pertinent morphological factors, such as body fat, body weight, and surface area in maintaining work-heat tolerance with aging. Recent studies suggest that middle-aged and older men and women may be more susceptible to greater heat strain at physiologically significant levels of dehydration than those younger. However, additional research appears necessary to support this hypothesis. When the effects of chronic debilitating diseases in the elderly (64 years old and older) are minimized, their heat tolerance and thermoregulatory responses are comparable to those of younger individuals. In fact, healthy and well acclimated elderly men and women appear to perform as well as younger individuals during desert walks in dry heat. This review discusses experimental observations from previously published studies concerning aging and heat tolerance or the physiological heat strain during heat acclimation at rest or during work; and it suggests future research efforts needed to understand this topic better."

CD009647,0,1898799,0,Pathogenesis of pulmonary edema during interleukin-2 therapy: correlation of chest radiographic and clinical findings in 54 patients.,"The pathogenesis of pulmonary edema that occurs during interleukin-2 therapy has often been attributed to an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability. However, renal insufficiency, fluid overload, and hypotension also develop in many patients. These manifestations of systemic toxicity may contribute to the development of pulmonary edema during therapy. Understanding the cause of pulmonary edema during interleukin-2 therapy could directly affect patients' care. Therefore, we reviewed the chest radiographs and clinical course of 54 patients who received high-dose interleukin-2 therapy and lymphokine-activated killer cells for advanced carcinoma. The type, frequency, and course over time of pulmonary abnormalities were recorded and correlated with clinical measures of renal function, fluid status, and blood pressure. Focal or diffuse parenchymal lung opacities were found on radiographs in 43 (80%) of 54 patients. Findings of interstitial pulmonary edema were most common, occurring in 76% of patients. Weight gain, hypotension, and elevation of the serum creatinine level were not associated statistically with interstitial edema. Diffuse air-space disease developed in 20% of patients. Focal consolidation, which was associated with positive central venous catheter cultures (p less than .03), developed in 28% of patients. Pleural effusion occurred in 48% of patients and was associated with all types of parenchymal disease. These data suggest that the frequent development of pulmonary edema during interleukin-2 therapy is not due to renal insufficiency, fluid overload, or hypotension, but is more likely the result of an interleukin-2-related increase in pulmonary capillary permeability."

A longitudinal and a cross-sectional study were included. Patients received either an 'adaptative ultrafiltration (UF)' PD regimen, which focused on gradually increasing peritoneal ultrafiltration (PDi group), or traditional PD treatment (PDt group). Patients' demographic characteristics, nutritional status, fluid removal as well as fluid status were recorded. In the cross-sectional study, all clinically stable patients who were treated with CAPD for at least three months were enrolled and grouped according to their time on dialysis: short term, medium term, and long term. Both studies showed that PDi and PDt patients had distinct fluid removal patterns. PDt patients had decreased total fluid removal with worsening fluid status and deteriorating nutritional status, whereas PDi patients remained rather stable in relation to fluid removal, fluid status, and improving nutritional status. Cox regression analysis confirmed that the PDi group had better patient survival than the PDt group. Our data suggest that traditional and 'adaptative UF' PD therapy may have distinct fluid removal patterns over time on dialysis, and this unique pattern might partly explain the still unacceptable high mortality of long-term CAPD patients."

A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up. Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level < or =60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia. At study entry, all patients underwent a physical examination and measurement of body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), an evaluation of signs of CHF, and measurement of control levels of serum Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia daily during hospitalization, and measurements of the daily output of urine for Na, K, and Cl. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained at study entry, during hospitalization, and at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the treatment and after discharge, the daily dietary Na intake was 120 mmol in group 1 versus 80 mmol in group 2, with a fluid intake of 1000 mL daily in both groups. An assessment of BW and 24-hour urinary volume, serum, and urinary laboratory parameters were performed daily until patients reached a compensated state, when IV furosemide was replaced with oral administration (250-500 mg/d). After discharge from the hospital, patients were observed as outpatients weekly for the first 3 months and, subsequently, once a month."

CD009647,0,9096904,0,Influence of the hydration state on blood pressure values in a group of patients on regular maintenance hemodialysis.,"The pathophysiology of hypertension in patients on renal replacement therapy is not yet clear, and the role of extracellular fluid overload is still a matter of debate. The main problem is the lack of techniques to determine the fluid state. Recently new noninvasive techniques have become available which make it possible to accurately determine the hydration state in these patients. We have studied the influence of the hydration state on interdialytic blood pressure in 45 patients: 21 (46.6%) using antihypertensive medication and 24 (53.4%) without antihypertensive medication. Total body water (TBW) was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis performed just before a hemodialysis session. The TBW was then related to the fat-free mass calculated by the anthropometric method (aFFM) of Durnin. The hydration state was defined using the following formula: TBW/aFFM 100. Furthermore, for each patient the ideal TBW was calculated according to the Watson formula. The difference between TBW and ideal TBW was considered a further index of the hydration state. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed by using a Takeda 24200 recorder according to the Korotkoff method during the 24 h before the midweek hemodialysis session. Blood pressure monitoring showed a significant correlation with the hydration state of these patients. In conclusion, the hydration state seems to play a major role in interdialytic blood pressure control."

Our objective was to determine whether predominant or exclusive use of crystalloids and/or hypooncotic colloids for shock resuscitation influenced the risk of late-onset ARDS. PARTICIPANT AND SETTINGS: International prospective cohort of consecutive adults who were free of ARDS on admission and who received fluid resuscitation for shock in 115 intensive care units (ICUs) during a 4-week period."
CD009647,0,1486910,0,Diuretics and cardiovascular risk factors.,"Thiazide diuretics are efficacious, either as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. They reduce blood pressure in a high percentage of hypertensive patients with minimal subjective side effects. There is increasing evidence that the use of diuretics, singly or in combination, will reduce morbidity and mortality associated with essential hypertension in both young and elderly subjects. Although diuretics may induce some changes in the plasma lipid profile, serum uric acid concentration and glucose metabolism, there is little evidence that these changes are of clinical significance. The increase in serum cholesterol concentration has rarely persisted in any trial beyond the first year of treatment. The incidence of diabetes mellitus in diuretic treated subjects is only about 1%, even when large doses are used. Gout may be precipitated in susceptible subjects, but is uncommon. For these reasons, diuretics should remain a preferred first-step drug of choice in the management of hypertension."

The upper lactic acid concentration in controls of 2.48 mmol/l was exceeded in all four patients, also in cases with low blast counts and normal protein and glucose content. The pH, pCO2, pO2 and standard bicarbonate concentration in spinal fluid of patients with meningeal dissemination in non-Hodgkin lymphoma did not show significant differences compared with other patients and controls. Determination of the lactic acid concentration in cerebrospinal fluid add information, relevant to the diagnosis of meningeal involvement in non-Hodgkin lymphoma."

CD009647,0,1711603,0,Plasma angiotensins in anephric humans: evidence for an extrarenal angiotensin system.,"The recent identification of messenger RNAs encoding renin and angiotensinogen in nonrenal tissues raises the possibility that angiotensins (Ang) may be formed extrarenally and released into the plasma. The aim of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that plasma angiotensins may originate from extrarenal sites. Twenty-five patients with chronic renal failure (six surgically anephric and 19 with kidneys in situ) were studied prior to and after a standard hemodialysis treatment. Angiotensins were measured by extraction, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, and radioimmunoassays. In patients with kidneys present, plasma renin activity (PRA) was 3.1 +/- 0.7 ng Ang I/ml/h. Ang I, Ang II, and Ang III levels were 70.6 +/- 9.0, 44.0 +/- 9.8, and 20.2 +/- 3.6 pg/ml, respectively. In all six anephric patients PRA was undetectable (less than 0.1 ng Ang I/ml/h). Ang I and Ang II were detected in four anephric patients, and Ang III was detected in three anephric patients (Ang I, 10.4 +/- 5.2; Ang II, 2.6 +/- 1.2; Ang III, 2.7 +/- 1.5 pg/ml, n = 6). At the completion of dialysis treatments, which reduced body weight by 2.5 +/- 0.2 kg in patients with kidneys and by 2.1 +/- 0.3 kg in anephric patients, there were no significant changes in PRA or plasma angiotensins in either group. Reduction in body water by hemodialysis did not increase the concentration of angiotensins in plasma. We conclude that there is a small but definite component of plasma angiotensin that is produced by nonrenal mechanisms and that is not stimulated by volume depletion."
CD009647,0,6794488,0,[Abdominal complications of heart surgery].,"Abdominal complications after cardiac surgery (excluding ""medical"" jaundice) are rare. Twenty six cases were observed out of a total of 7 847 operations (0.33%) performed between 1973 and 1980. The causes were very diverse; the most common being gastroduodenal ulceration, usually acute (9 cases). Other cases included intestinal (3 cases of postoperative ileus, 4 cases of mesenteric infarction, 2 cases of necrosing enterocolitis), biliary (2 cases of acute cholecystitis) and splenic pathology (2 cases of splenic infarction, one associated with necrosing enterocolitis). Anticoagulant therapy was implicated in 3 cases. Diagnosis is difficult in the immediate postoperative period, some complications only being recognised at autopsy. The clinical signs may be misleading and the interpretation of complementary investigations difficult. Therefore, the possibility of abdominal complications must be kept in mind, especially in patients with one or more predisposing factors. Excluding accidents due to anticoagulant therapy the following factors were associated with an increased risk of abdominal complications: previous history of gastro intestinal pathology (ulcer, gall stone, alcoholism) the nature of the underlying cardiac disease (coronary artery and aortic valve disease), cardiopulmonary bypass, and, above all, per- and postoperative incidents: hypovolaemia, low output syndrome (half the patients in this series) respiratory and infectious complications. The inappropriate use of vasoconstricting agents may also play a role. The majority of abdominal complications seemed to be related to ischaemia and anoxia in the splanchnic territory, which explains the important role of the preceding factors. The prognosis of abdominal complications after cardiac surgery was poor, mortality reaching 50 to 100% in some causes: in this series, 12 of the patients died. This justifies certain prophylactic measures: strict selection of patients, diagnosis and treatment of associated abdominal pathology before operation, prevention of low output states, respiratory and infectious complications ... and careful examination of the abdomen after operation to ensure the early diagnosis and treatment of complications, should they develop."

CD009647,0,11161539,0,Assessment of body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis without the need for measurement of height.,"Conventional whole-body single frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) of body composition typically uses height as a surrogate measure of conductor length. A new method of BIA analysis for the prediction of body cell mass (BCM) and extracellular water (ECW, as % body weight) not using height has been introduced-the Soft Tissue Analyser (STA(TM), Akern Sri, Florence, Italy)-making it ideal for use in subjects where measurement of height is difficult or impossible. The performance of the new analytical method in predicting BCM and ECW in 139 normal control subjects was assessed by comparison with reference data obtained from a four-component (4-C) model of body composition and with predictions obtained from conventional BIA analysis. Both predicted BCM and ECW were strongly (r=0.82, SEE=6.3 kg and 0.89, SEE=1.3 kg respectively) correlated with the corresponding 4-C model measurements although differing significantly from the lines of identity (P<0.0001). Fat-free mass, calculated from STA estimates of BCM and ECW, was better predicted (r=0.91, SEE=5.6 kg). The significant differences in STA-group mean values for BCM and ECW and wide limits of agreement compared with the reference data indicate that the method cannot be used with confidence for prediction of these body compartments despite the obvious advantage of not requiring an accurate measurement of height."
CD009647,0,7058478,0,Primary mesenteric venous thrombosis.,"To elucidate further the characteristics, optimal management and ultimate outcome of patients with primary mesenteric venous thrombosis, the records of nine such patients were analyzed. There were seven male and two female patients, with a mean age of 47 years. Abdominal pain, vomiting, fever and hematochezia were the characteristics presenting complaints. Tenderness, distention and diminished intestinal sounds were the prominent abdominal physical findings and were often associated with tachycardia and hypotension. No one of the laboratory findings were specifically diagnostic for mesenteric venous thrombosis, but leukocytosis and hemoconcentration were commonly found. Roentgenographic findings were consistent with intestinal obstruction in six patients. Thrombosis of the mesenteric veins could not be attributed to any specific cause in these nine patients, thereby warranting the classification of primary. At operation, all nine patients were found to have a segment of infarcted small intestine--132 +/- 105 centimeters--with obvious thrombosis of the mesenteric veins but with patent mesenteric arteries. Five patients had bloody ascites. Two deaths occurred in the immediate postoperative period, both being due to sudden and unexpected cardiopulmonary arrest. Neither of these two patients received anticoagulant therapy. Two patients had undergone segmental resection at other hospitals and were referred to our institution because of a recurrence of acute abdominal signs and symptoms. Neither of these patients received anticoagulant therapy. At reoperation, both had recurrent segmental mesenteric venous thrombosis. Familiarity with this condition is essential in making the correct diagnosis, so that resection may be undertaken promptly. Heparin should immediately be administered intravenously after establishing the diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis to prevent recurrent thrombosis and other possible thrombotic complications. If these steps are taken expeditiously, the prognosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis is often favorable."

CD009647,0,9095588,0,[Perioperative management of uremia and fluid balance in patients with compromised renal function undergoing open heart surgery].,"Five patients with renal dysfunction underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Three patients were in cardiogenic shock with acute myocardial infarction for whom CABG was carried out on emergent basis. Immediate preoperatively these patients were in almost anuria which was derived from sustained renal dysfunction plus decreased renal perfusion due to low cardiac output. The other two patients were operated on electively, and hemodynamic instability and artificial perfusion (cardiopulmonary bypass) affected their chronic renal disease (polycystic kidney and nephrosclerosis, respectively) so unfavorably that intraoperative anuria took place. In all patients intraoperative control of fluid balance and prevention of azotemia were accomplished by intraoperative hemofiltration (HF), in which 10 litters of body fluid was filtered out through a hemofiliter incorporated into the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and replaced with saline solution. In emergent cases (three patients) complete anuria was sustained and continuous hemodialysis/hemofilitration (CHDF) was successively performed to control water balance and to prevent exacerbation of uremia. Although they all were in profound low cardiac output state necessitating intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) and infusion of considerable amount of catecholamines, there was no hemodynamic instability occurred throughout the period of CHDF. In four cases renal function recovered significantly along with the recover from their cardiogenic shock so that they could wean from the hemodialysis therapy. In the remaining case intermittent hemodialysis was necessary in chronic phase. There were no hospital death nor late mortality. From this experience we might conclude that the combined use of intraoperative HF and successive postoperative CHDF is an effective method for controlling fluid balance and preventing uremia in cardiac surgical patients with severe renal dysfunction along with considerable hemodynamic instability."
CD009647,0,3039842,0,Treatment of mild to moderate hypertension with or without the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Results of a six-month double-blind trial.,"A group of 205 patients with mild to moderate essential uncomplicated hypertension was chosen from 3,183 hypertensive patients referred to a hypertension clinic for the first time, and was asked to participate in a six-month double-blind parallel trial. A single physician was in charge of all the patients. After a two-week single-blind placebo period, the patients were randomly assigned to regimens of either enalapril (20 mg per day) or placebo. Both groups were then followed up every two weeks, and increasing doses of hydrochlorothiazide (25 and 50 mg), oxprenolol (160 and 320 mg), and dihydralazine (50 and 100 mg) were added until the diastolic blood pressure was lower than 90 mm Hg. After a six-month follow-up, the enalapril group showed lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures than the control group (129/82 +/- 12/6 mg Hg versus 135/86 +/- 10/5 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). The number of daily tablets of active drugs was 2.7 +/- 1.8 in the enalapril group and 4.4 +/- 2.4 in the control group (p less than 0.01). The mean plasma potassium level was 4.16 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter in the enalapril group versus 3.92 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter in the control group (p less than 0.001), despite more frequent use of amiloride (p less than 0.001). This difference is explained by the lower dose of hydrochlorothiazide used in the enalapril group by comparison to the control group, and a lower excretion of urinary aldosterone in the enalapril group than in the control group (11.6 +/- 7.4 versus 19.8 +/- 11.8 micrograms per 24 hours, p less than 0.001). Drug withdrawal was necessary in eight patients in the enalapril group and in 16 patients in the control group (p less than 0.05). These results show that first-step treatment of mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension with enalapril permits better blood pressure control than the standard treatment, requires fewer tablets to be taken daily, and involves a smaller risk of hypokalemia."

CD009647,0,8861835,0,Bioelectrical impedance for monitoring the efficacy of lymphoedema treatment programmes.,"The treatment of lymphoedema includes a combination of massage, compression bandaging, and exercise. To date the most common technique of assessing the efficacy of treatment has involved estimating the total limb volume from circumferential measurements at fixed intervals along the limb. This study investigated the application of multiple frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis, MFBIA, to monitor the volume of lymphoedema in the upper limb of patients who developed this disorder following surgery for cancer of the breast. Daily measurements of both circumference and impedance of both the affected and unaffected limbs were recorded for 20 patients throughout their 4 week treatment programmes. Twenty control subjects were also monitored daily over a similar 4 week period. Prior to the commencement of treatment the bioimpedance technique detected a significant (P < 0.01) asymmetry between the two limbs of the control subjects, associated with handedness (P < 0.001). Circumferential estimates of limb volumes in the control group detected no asymmetry. Impedance measures of extracellular fluid showed all of the patients to lie outside the 95% confidence interval determined from the data of the control group. The trends of the impedance measures and the circumferential estimates of volume throughout the 4 week program were found to be significantly different (P < 0.05); MFBIA exhibiting a greater sensitivity in the detection of lymphoedema. The results demonstrate that MFBIA is significantly more sensitive than circumferential measurement both in the early diagnosis of lymphoedema and in monitoring change."

CD009647,0,6786952,0,Effect of added insulin on body composition of gastroenterologic patients receiving intravenous nutrition--a controlled clinical trial.,"The administration of insulin of hypercatabolic patients with burns or multiple fractures has been shown to be associated with increased nitrogen retention during intravenous nutrition (IVN) with solutions of amino acids and hypertonic dextrose. It is not known if gastroenterologic patients in whom the degree of stress is much less, show a similar response. In a controlled study of two comparable groups of 16 gastroenterologic patients on a surgical service who received IVN for 2 wk the changes in body weight, fat, water, protein, and potassium that occurred were measured. The control group received a nutrient solution of hypertonic glucose and amino acids (44.7 +/- 9.0 kcal/kg/day) and the comparative group (45.9 +/- 6.6 kcal/kg/day) in addition had 30 IU of soluble insulin added to each 1006 kcal of nutrient solution. Both groups of patients gained similar amounts of weight, fat, and water, and body protein was maintained to the same extent. Those patients receiving insulin demonstrated a gain of total body potassium (p less than 0.001). The results show that the routine administration of insulin is not indicated in this type of patient, provided that glucose intolerance is absent."
CD009647,0,1831809,0,Preliminary study on behaviour of atrial natriuretic factor in anthracycline-related cardiac toxicity.,"The atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure (CHF), by influencing electrolyte and water balance and by modifying peripheral vascular resistance, thus affecting left ventricular performance. Anthracycline derivatives are glycoside antibiotics, active against a wide spectrum of tumours. It is well known that acute and severe dose-related delayed cardiotoxicity constitutes the major limitation to their optimal use. A total of 26 female patients (mean age 53 years) undergoing monochemotherapy for advanced breast cancer, were studied. 4'-Epidoxorubicin (Epidx) 120 mg/m2 intravenously was administered every three weeks for a total of a mean of 6.6 therapeutic cycles (3 to 10). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) determined by radionuclide ventriculography and circulating ANF were measured periodically in all patients. Epidx administration was limited at a cumulative dose ranging between 840 and 1200 mg/m2 because of a 25% decrease in LVEF and due to a progressive rising in ANF plasma levels. Furthermore, two patients who presented clinical symptoms of CHF had also significantly increased ANF levels (56 and 49% respectively). The current evidence suggests an important pathophysiological role of ANF in anthracyclinic related CHF. Hopefully measurement of plasma ANF will provide a simple non-invasive method of assessing ventricular dysfunction related to anthracycline cardiac toxicity and might represent an additional objective indicator of the severity of haemodynamic compromise in patients with impaired cardiac function."

CD009647,0,15103940,0,[Severe hyponatremia with consciousness disturbance caused by hydroxyurea in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia].,"A 79-year-old man was admitted because of consciousness disturbance on August 9, 2002. He had been diagnosed as having chronic myeloid leukemia in 1999, and since then, he had continued to take hydroxyurea (1500 mg/day) orally. On admission, his serum sodium concentration was as low as 119 mEq/L, while urinary sodium excretion was high. Based on the blood picture and lack of hepatosplenomegaly, we considered that the leukemia was still in the chronic phase. Because of normal blood level of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) concentration and sufficient urine volume, the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) was unlikely, and sodium-losing nephropathy was suspected. After discontinuation of hydroxyurea, the urinary sodium excretion decreased and the patient's consciousness became clear concomitantly with improvement in the serum Na level. This patient appears to be the first case of hyponatremia caused by hydroxyurea."

The clinical efficacy of sucralfate (Carafate R) mouthwash for head and neck cancer patients (HNC) is not consistent across studies. In this study, it was hypothesized that if the particles in the original sucralfate suspension were micronized (i.e., < or = 25 microns) then the coating action of the mouthwash in the oral cavity would be enhanced. The purpose of this pilot study was to compare the efficacy of micronized sucralfate (Carafate R) mouthwash and salt & soda mouthwash in terms of the severity of the mucositis, the severity of mucositis-related pain, and the time required to heal RT-induced mucositis in patients with HNC. Severe mucositis and related pain can interfere with the ingestion of food and fluids, so patients' body weights were measured as well. All patients in this randomized clinical trial carried out a systematic oral hygiene protocol called the PRO-SELF: Mouth Aware (PSMA) Program. Patients who developed RT-induced mucositis anytime during their course of RT were randomized to one of the two mouthwashes and followed to the completion of RT and at one month following RT. Two referral sites were used for the study. Repeated measures occurred with the following instruments/variables: MacDibbs Mouth Assessment and weight. Demographic, disease, and cancer treatment information was also obtained. Thirty patients successfully completed the study. The typical participant was male (70%), married/partnered (70%), White (63%), not working or retired (73%), and had an average of 14.5 years of education (SD = 3.7). T-tests and Chi-square analyses with an alpha set at 0.05 were used to compare differences between the two mouthwashes. No significant differences were found in the number of days to onset of mucositis (i.e., 16 +/- 8.4 days). When patients had their worst MacDibbs score, (i.e., the most severe mucositis), there were no significant differences between the mouthwashes as to MacDibbs score, the RT dose received, or ratings of pain (upon swallowing). Similarly, at the end of RT, no significant differences were found between mouthwashes as to MacDibbs scores or ratings of pain (upon swallowing). At the one-month follow-up assessment no significant differences were found between the mouthwashes in MacDibbs scores or pain ratings (upon swallowing). The analysis of the efficacy of the two mouthwashes revealed no significant differences in the time to heal (in days) from the RT-induced mucositis. The findings from this trial provide important clinical information regarding cost analysis of RT mucositis management. Given that there is no significant difference in efficacy between micronized sucralfate and salt & soda, use of the less costly salt & soda is prudent and cost-effective."
CD009647,0,12570322,0,Combined opto-electronic perometry and bioimpedance to measure objectively the effectiveness of a new treatment intervention for chronic secondary leg lymphedema.,"Secondary lymphedema of the legs is a common sequela of patients treated for cancer of the reproductive, gastrointestinal, urinary systems and melanoma. From a clinical and research perspective it is of utmost importance to use techniques that objectively quantify leg volume and fluid composition as an indicator of lymphedema severity and response to treatment. Two techniques often used in both the clinical and research setting are leg perometry and multi-frequency bioimpedance. Although both techniques have been extensively validated, this trial aimed to cross correlate both measurement techniques to ascertain whether each or both could be used reliably for measurement of leg lymphedema. These measurements were utilized throughout a clinical trial that assessed the effectiveness of a new home based treatment program in the form of the Sun Ancon Aerobic Exerciser. This machine delivered both elevation and passive exercise to the legs, with participants using the machine over a three week period during which time their leg volumes were measured using both perometry and bioimpedance. The results demonstrated that leg volume measurements decreased using both perometry and bioimpedance. The reduction in body extracellular fluid as measured by bioimpedance correlated well with a reduction in leg volume as measured by perometry. Bioimpedance also recorded a reduction in weight, which was correlated with the reduction in leg volume as measured by perometry. This trial confirms that perometry and bioimpedance were both effective in independently showing a reduction in leg lymphedema using the Aerobic Exerciser therapy, and that both methods can be reliably used to measure and follow leg lymphedema."

CD009647,0,19465787,0,Clinical significance of elevated natriuretic peptide levels and cardiopulmonary parameters after subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Daily changes in serum concentrations of natriuretic peptides and various cardiopulmonary parameters were measured after the onset of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) to investigate the pathogenesis of the cardiac and pulmonary consequences in 15 patients with acute phase SAH, divided into the control group (n = 5) with consciousness continuously preserved from SAH onset to admission, and the consciousness disturbance group (n = 10). Daily changes in serum A-type and B-type natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP, respectively) were measured for 10 days, and intrathoracic blood volume index and extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) were measured for 5 days by the single transpulmonary thermodilution method. Natriuretic peptides in the consciousness disturbance group showed significantly higher values during the 10-day period, with ANP 119.2 +/- 12.4 pg/ml (mean +/- standard error of the mean, p = 0.005) on day 2 and BNP 354.1 +/- 80.3 pg/ml (p = 0.009) on day 1. EVLWI showed higher values in the consciousness disturbance group compared to the control group throughout the 5-day period. The increases in natriuretic peptide levels and increase in pulmonary extravascular water content found in SAH patients with consciousness disturbance show that load on the left ventricle or atrium as well as pulmonary capillary pressure are increased immediately after onset, supporting the contention that excessive release of catecholamines occurs at this time."

Spinal anesthesia using with 7 mg of hyperbaric tetracaine with dextrose solution was performed for this surgery. The running pressure of D-sorbitol solution was 50 cmH2O during the operation. The operation time was 41 minutes and the balance of running water was -200 ml. After this TUR-P, there was no progression of his palsy, muscle atrophy or no aggravation of autonomic system immediately after the operation, 3 months later and 6 months later, respectively. This case suggests that spinal anesthesia can be applied in post-poliomyelitis patients. The perioperative maintenance of electrolyte control for endoscopic surgery with water running is more important than anesthetic procedure itself in this case."

CD009647,0,20445156,0,Diurnal variation in time to presyncope and associated circulatory changes during a controlled orthostatic challenge.,"Epidemiological data indicate that the risk of neurally mediated syncope is substantially higher in the morning. Syncope is precipitated by cerebral hypoperfusion, yet no chronobiological experiment has been undertaken to examine whether the major circulatory factors, which influence perfusion, show diurnal variation during a controlled orthostatic challenge. Therefore, we examined the diurnal variation in orthostatic tolerance and circulatory function measured at baseline and at presyncope. In a repeated-measures experiment, conducted at 0600 and 1600, 17 normotensive volunteers, aged 26 +/- 4 yr (mean +/- SD), rested supine at baseline and then underwent a 60 degrees head-up tilt with 5-min incremental stages of lower body negative pressure until standardized symptoms of presyncope were apparent. Pretest hydration status was similar at both times of day. Continuous beat-to-beat measurements of cerebral blood flow velocity, blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and end-tidal Pco(2) were obtained. At baseline, mean cerebral blood flow velocity was 9 +/- 2 cm/s (15%) lower in the morning than the afternoon (P < 0.0001). The mean time to presyncope was shorter in the morning than in the afternoon (27.2 +/- 10.5 min vs. 33.1 +/- 7.9 min; 95% CI: 0.4 to 11.4 min, P = 0.01). All measurements made at presyncope did not show diurnal variation (P > 0.05), but the changes over time (from baseline to presyncope time) in arterial blood pressure, estimated peripheral vascular resistance, and alpha-index baroreflex sensitivity were greater during the morning tests (P < 0.05). These data indicate that tolerance to an incremental orthostatic challenge is markedly reduced in the morning due to diurnal variations in the time-based decline in blood pressure and the initial cerebral blood flow velocity ""reserve"" rather than the circulatory status at eventual presyncope. Such information may be used to help identify individuals who are particularly prone to orthostatic intolerance in the morning."

CD009647,0,19608378,0,Prediction of survival time in advanced cancer: a prognostic scale for Chinese patients.,"This study reports the development of a simple Chinese Prognostic Scale (ChPS) for predicting survival in advanced cancer patients. Data relating to 1,019 advanced cancer patients referred to a palliative home care service were retrospectively analyzed. The records were divided into two sets using stratified random sampling: 80% as a ""training set"" for developing the scale and 20% as a ""testing set"" for validating it. Demographic data, symptoms/signs, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), quality of life (QOL), and survival time were statistically analyzed to create the scale. In the training set, a total of 10 prognostic factors were determined: weight loss, nausea, dysphagia, dyspnea, edema, cachexia, dehydration, gender, KPS, and QOL. The ChPS score was calculated for each case by summing the partial scores of prognostic factors, ranging from 0 (no altered variables) to 124 (maximal altered variables). The score for a cutoff point of three months' survival was 28 (95% confidence interval: 26.6, 28.9). When scores were more than 28, survival appeared to be usually less than three months. The accuracy rate was 69.4% in the training set and 65.4% in the testing set. In conclusion, it is possible with this prognostic scale to guide physicians in predicting more accurately the likely survival time of Chinese cancer patients, and to help policy makers in establishing appropriate referral for hospice care."
CD009647,0,6206095,0,Proximal renal tubular function in myelomatosis: observations in the fourth Medical Research Council trial.,"Proximal renal tubular function was studied in 522 consecutive patients entered into the Medical Research Council's fourth myelomatosis trial. Assessment was made at presentation after a 48 h period of hydration but before administration of chemotherapy. The most common abnormalities in the urine other than light chain proteinuria were raised concentrations of the low molecular weight proteins alpha 1-microglobulin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. These were usually accompanied by increases in urinary beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase concentrations. The concentration of these substances in the urine directly correlated with urinary free light chain output. This tubular proteinuria was seen whether or not patients had impaired glomerular function, as assessed by a rise in serum creatinine concentration. Urinary concentrations of retinol binding protein, however, were generally increased only when serum creatinine concentrations were raised. This applied even when there were high concentrations of light chains, alpha 1-microglobulin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase in the urine. There is therefore a selective tubular proteinuria in myelomatosis which is seen in almost all patients with urinary light chain values greater than 1 u/l. This proteinuria is generally reversible, when light chains no longer appear in the urine. Patients whose serum creatinine was greater than 200 mumol/l, however, had increased urinary output of retinol binding protein in addition to increased excretion of alpha 1-microglobulin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase. Tubular proteinuria in many of these patients presenting in renal failure persisted even when light chain output was reduced after chemotherapy."
CD009647,0,15778157,0,Body composition and nutrient intake of hypertensive elders and middle-aged men and women in Nigeria.,"Body composition of eighty hypertensive patients (43 middle-aged, 30-59 years and 37 elders, 60-80 years) was determined by anthropometry alongside their dietary intake. The mean body weight and height of female elders were 54.1 +/- 14.6 kg and 157.0 +/- 7.0 cm while that of male elders were 61.8 +/- 13.5 kg and 167.1 +/- 9.0 cm. Corresponding values for middle-aged subjects were also determined. The middle-aged subjects were heavier and taller than the elders in both sexes. Among the elders BMI values 21.7 (females) and 22.1 (males) were normal, but the female had higher percentage body fat (28.0 +/- 0.1%) than males (20.8 +/- 5.2%). Other body composition parameters determined included lean body mass, optimum body weight, body water, skin-fold thickness and arm muscle diameter. BMI was significantly correlated with high blood pressure. The mean energy and nutrient intake of the subjects were inadequate except for the female elders."
CD009647,0,3525088,0,The elderly patient. A special case for diuretic therapy.,"Diuretics are among the most widely prescribed drugs, especially for the elderly with cardiac failure or hypertension. Progressive structural and functional changes occur in the kidneys after the fourth decade, leading to impairment of the ability of the kidneys to handle sodium, water and solutes. The renal reserves of the elderly are about half those of the young. In addition, the renin-aldosterone system shows reduced activity in old age. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diuretics in the elderly are reviewed, and the influence of congestive cardiac failure is emphasised with regard to the kinetics of diuretics and the deleterious effect of diuretic-induced hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia on the pharmacology of digoxin. Guidelines are suggested for the use of diuretics in the elderly, including the avoidance of unnecessary use, the careful choice of diuretic used, the need for small initial doses, and the prevention of hypokalaemia. The place of potassium-sparing agents for the elderly and adverse effects of diuretics, either mechanical, metabolic or toxic are discussed. Mechanical problems are related to the rate and volume of urine produced, and the resulting effects on bladder function and on blood volume. Although toxic effects are relatively rare, metabolic effects include electrolyte changes, impairment of glucose tolerance, and increased serum uric acid and lipids. Most of these adverse effects are preventable by careful management; the consensus is that they are not of sufficient clinical significance to outweigh the long record of efficacy and safety of diuretic therapy in the elderly. Diuretics will, and should, continue to be used extensively in elderly patients with hypertension and/or cardiac failure."
CD009647,0,7572019,0,"Fluid balance and pulmonary functions during and after coronary artery bypass surgery: Ringer's acetate compared with dextran, polygeline, or albumin.","The effects on fluid balance, pulmonary functions and economics were evaluated in a randomized comparison of one colloid free and three colloid containing fluid regimens, for 48 hours during and after coronary artery bypass (CAB) surgery. A standard regimen for anaesthesia, extracorporeal circulation and monitoring was used. Only Ringer's acetate (RAc) was used as priming solution for extracorporeal circulation. Forty patients were randomized to receive either RAc, polygeline 35 mg.ml-1 (Haemaccel), dextran 70 (Macrodex) 60 mg.ml-1, or albumin 40 mg.ml-1 in saline whenever fluid volume was needed to stabilize haemodynamics. At the end of the operation, fluid retention was significantly lower in patients receiving polygeline and dextran 70, compared with patients receiving RAc. At 48 hours, however, there were no differences in cumulative fluid balance. Patients in the colloid groups postoperatively had a higher serum colloid osmotic pressure (s-COP), but a higher net lung capillary filtration pressure (delta P) only on the second postoperative day than the RAc group. However, this did not adversely affect intrapulmonary venous admixture, arterial oxygen tension, or time on respirator in the RAc group compared with the colloid groups. The most expensive colloid fluid regimen (albumin) cost about 230 US$ more per patient than the RAc fluid regimen. We conclude that Ringer's acetate for volume replacement to stabilize haemodynamics during and after CAB surgery is associated with increased fluid retention only during the intraoperative period, compared with dextran 70 or polygeline, and with a lower serum colloid osmotic pressure and net lung capillary filtration pressure postoperatively, compared with all three colloid groups. This does not affect pulmonary functions adversely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

He had been receiving allopurinol for about 5 months for the treatment of chronic gouty arthropathy of more than 30 years' duration. On examination, his right knee was warm and swollen. The aspirated fluid contained intracellular and extracellular monosodium urate crystals, but Gram staining and culture were negative.

Physical examination at this time showed no sign of inflammation, but the knee had a very limited range of motion."
CD009647,0,393503,0,Prolonged pseudoaldosteronism induced by glycyrrhizin.,"We describe the natural recovery from the aggravated hypertension, hypokalemia and suppression of the renin-aldosterone axis after the glycyrrhizin discontinuation in two mild hypertensive women aged 71 and 68 years, who had been administered 273 to 546 mg glycyrrhizin daily for 1.5 and 6 months, respectively, for the treatment of liver disease. About one month after the glycyrrhizin discontinuation, acceleration of hypertension, hypokalemia and suppression of the renin-aldosterone system still continued in both patients. At this stage, sodium restriction resulted in the normalization of blood pressure with weight loss and the subsequent sodium repletion produced a rapid increase in blood pressure to hypertensive levels observed before sodium restriction, with weight gain. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone were low and did not respond to sodium restriction. Inappropriately excessive amounts of potassium were also excreted in the presence of hypokalemia. About one and a half months later, the improvements of aggravated hypertension, hypokalemia and suppressed renin-aldosterone system gradually occurred in both patients. Sodium restriction performed about three months later in case 2 no longer produced the changes in blood pressure and body weight. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone responded subnormally to sodium restriction. These results demonstrate that both patients had a prolongation of the syndrome resembling primary aldosteronism except the low plasma aldosterone level about one month after the glycyrrhizin discontinuation. The possible mechanisms by which this prolongation was caused are discussed."

CD009647,0,19153045,0,Aquaporin-4 expression is increased in edematous meningiomas.,"Peritumoral edema is frequently present in meningiomas and can result in serious morbidity and mortality. The aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of membrane protein water channels with an integral role in water transport and maintenance of fluid balance. AQP4, increased in edematous human brain tumors such as astrocytomas and metastases, is present in the astrocytic foot processes adjacent to endothelial cells and may therefore have a role in cerebral edema formation. The objective of this study is to investigate the expression of AQP4 in meningiomas and to correlate their expression with peritumoral edema. Fresh human meningioma specimens (17) were obtained and immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis was performed for AQP4. The peritumoral edema index (EI) was calculated based on MRI post-processed to calculate the tumor and edema volume. Overexpression of AQP4 was associated with significant peritumoral edema. Immunohistochemistry showed upregulation of AQP4 throughout the specimens. Therefore, we conclude that increased expression of AQP4 is associated with peritumoral edema in meningiomas. This suggests that AQP4 overexpression can lead to abnormal water transport and edema formation in meningiomas. The inhibition of AQP4 water channels is a potential therapeutic option to reduce the adverse effects of peritumoral edema in meningiomas."

CD009647,0,9804092,0,Hyponatremia in a patient with chronic inflammatory disease.,"A 66-year-old man was admitted with destructive arthropathy, and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate was demonstrated in the synovial fluid specimen. He was found to have a hyponatremia. The serum sodium concentration was 121 mmol/l, plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) 6.6 pmol/l, and serum interleukin (IL)-6 96 pg/l. The clinical findings suggest the diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). However, destructive arthropathy with increased values of C-reactive protein and IL-6 is the only background of SIADH in this patient. We suggest the possibility that IL-6 produced at inflammatory lesions may have stimulated an excessive release of AVP resulting in the hyponatremia and hypochloremia of SIADH."
CD009647,0,15521614,0,[Symptoms of severe digoxin intoxication in patients hospitalized in geriatric wards].,"Digoxin is a drug commonly used in geriatrics. The purpose of the study is to present cases of elderly patients hospitalized on the Geriatric Ward of the Provincial Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital ""Dziekanka"" in Gniezno with extremely high level of digoxin in the blood serum. The study was based on the case history of patients hospitalized on the ward from July 1998 to June 2003. During that time 83 patients (age: 77.4 +/- 8.1 years old, 60 females and 23 males) were suspected to suffer from digoxin intoxication on the basis of their morbid states, and their digoxin level in serum was measured. Furthermore, medical documentation of four patients with extremely high digoxin level was profoundly analyzed. Such is regarded, the level which exceeds by 100% the upper limit of concentration believed to be therapeutic (2 ng/ml) which is 4 ng/ml. The paper also includes a profile of clinical conditions of the patients at the time of their admission to the ward. While analyzing the patients' states, careful attention was drawn to the symptoms that might be caused by digoxin intoxication (changes in the ECG, central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract disturbances). However, because of typical for geriatrics polypathology and not clear characteristic clinical symptoms of majority of pathological syndromes, even severe intoxication may turn out to be impossible to diagnose. In the paper, coexistence of risk factors predisposing to appearance of toxic symptoms such as kidney failure, hypoproteinemia, dehydration, hypoxia, electrolyte abnormalities, drug interactions, and a possibility of improper taking medication were pointed out. It was concluded that lack of specific signs of severe digoxin intoxication among the elderly results in the fact that every worsening in a patient's state of health of an unknown reason treated with digoxin should be suspected as digitalis' glycosides intoxication."

CD009647,0,7609534,0,Bioelectric impedance detects fluid retention in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.,"Excessive fluid accumulation is associated with increased morbidity and prolonged convalescence after cardiopulmonary bypass. However, water fluctuations are difficult to assess solely on the basis of changes in body weight and fluid balance. Bioelectric impedance analysis is a simple, rapid, noninvasive bedside technique that measures the resistance of the body to a weak alternating current (50 kHz). The change in resistance is inversely proportional to the change in total body water. To investigate the relationship between body weight, fluid balance, and resistance, 18 patients who had cardiopulmonary bypass (9 men, 9 women, aged 61 +/- 3 years, weighing 80 +/- 4 kg, with ejection fraction 54% +/- 3% and bypass time 113 +/- 8 minutes [mean plus or minus standard error of the mean]) were followed up for 7 postoperative days. Body weight, fluid balance, and whole body and regional resistance were determined at 24-hour intervals. In the immediate postoperative period, fluid retention was accurately detected by simultaneous measurements of weight gain and decreased resistance (p < 0.001). Both measurements detected the initiation of diuresis by postoperative day 2 (p < 0.01). Whole body resistance returned to baseline values by day 7 (p > 0.05), and body weight returned to baseline on day 4 (p > 0.05). Change in weight and change in whole body resistance were highly correlated with cumulative fluid balance (r = 0.84, p < 0.001, and r = -0.81, p < 0.001, respectively), and these two measures were also related to each other throughout the study (r = -0.89, p < 0.001). The initial change in resistance was the best measurement associated with postoperative outcome (p < or = 0.01). The data suggest that the measurement of electric resistance across the body can accurately detect acute changes in total body water and in fluid redistribution through the body. However, determining the relative day-to-day change in whole body resistance seems more appropriate than calculating absolute fluid changes over time. Bioelectric impedance offers a simple, rapid, noninvasive method to monitor serial changes in total body water. This technique can be useful in situations in which rapid alterations in water compartments occur, and it may be useful in predicting outcome after cardiopulmonary bypass."

The present study was undertaken to assess the renal effects of the specific Cox-2 inhibitor, MK-966. Healthy older adults (n = 36) were admitted to a clinical research unit, placed on a fixed sodium intake, and randomized under double-blind conditions to receive the specific Cox-2 inhibitor, MK-966 (50 mg every day), a nonspecific Cox-1/Cox-2 inhibitor, indomethacin (50 mg t.i.d.), or placebo for 2 weeks. All treatments were well tolerated. Both active regimens were associated with a transient but significant decline in urinary sodium excretion during the first 72 h of treatment. Blood pressure and body weight did not change significantly in any group. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was decreased by indomethacin but was not changed significantly by MK-966 treatment. Thromboxane biosynthesis by platelets was inhibited by indomethacin only. The urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 2,3-dinor-6-keto prostaglandin F1alpha was decreased by both MK-966 and indomethacin and was unchanged by placebo. Cox-2 may play a role in the systemic biosynthesis of prostacyclin in healthy humans. Selective inhibition of Cox-2 by MK-966 caused a clinically insignificant and transient retention of sodium, but no depression of GFR. Inhibition of both Cox isoforms by indomethacin caused transient sodium retention and a decline in GFR. Our data suggest that acute sodium retention by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in healthy elderly subjects is mediated by the inhibition of Cox-2, whereas depression of GFR is due to inhibition of Cox-1."

Patients with heatstroke have a complete loss of thermoregulation, a core temperature greater than 40.5 degrees C (105 degrees F) and impaired mental status. These critically ill patients must be cooled quickly to 39 degrees C (102 degrees F) to avoid devastating complications. Intensive care monitoring and support are indicated. To reduce the risk of heat injury in hot weather, frail and elderly persons must maintain hydration and may need to consider alternate living arrangements.

The Iohexol Cooperative Study.,"Contrast agents used for cardiac angiography are different in regard to ionicity, osmolality and physiologic effects. The nonionic contrast media have been shown to have less toxic effects and a better safety profile than do higher osmolar agents. To better assess this risk, clinically stable patients undergoing cardiac angiography were stratified according to the presence of diabetes mellitus, and level of serum creatinine, and then randomized to receive either iohexol (Omnipaque 350) or sodium meglumine diatrizoate (Renografin 76). All adverse events that occurred during and immediately after angiography were tabulated. A multivariate model was used to identify patients at increased risk for adverse outcome. The 1,390 patients were randomized to iohexol (n = 696) or diatrizoate (n = 694). Significant differences were found in the number of patients with contrast media-related adverse (iohexol vs diatrizoate: 10.2 vs 31.6%; p < 0.001) and cardiac adverse (7.2 vs 24.5%; p < 0.001) events. Severe reactions and the need for treatment were more frequent with diatrizoate than with iohexol, but there was no difference in the incidence of death. The presence of New York Heart Association classification 3 or 4 and serum creatinine > or = 1.5 mg/dl predicted a higher incidence of adverse events as a result of contrast media alone. Use of iohexol is associated with a lower incidence of all types of adverse events during cardiac angiography than is diatrizoate."

Vasopressin receptor antagonists improve serum sodium concentration by increasing renal solute-free water excretion, but their effects on the management of ascites have not been assessed. Our aim was to investigate the effects of satavaptan, a highly selective vasopressin V(2) receptor antagonist, on ascites management and serum sodium in hyponatremic patients with cirrhosis. A total of 110 patients with cirrhosis, ascites, and hyponatremia (serum sodium < or =130 mmol/L) were included in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled study comparing three fixed doses of satavaptan (5 mg, 12.5 mg, or 25 mg once daily) versus placebo. Duration of treatment was 14 days and all patients received spironolactone at 100 mg/day. Satavaptan treatment was associated with improved control of ascites, as indicated by a reduction in body weight (mean change at Day 14 was +0.49 kg [+/-4.99] for placebo versus +0.15 kg [+/-4.23], -1.59 kg [+/-4.60] and -1.68 kg [+/-4.98] for the 5 mg, 12.5 mg, and 25 mg doses, respectively; P = 0.05 for a dose-effect relationship overall) and a parallel reduction in abdominal girth.

It has been validated in healthy control subjects but not in patients with liver disease. We examined the ability of BIA to detect changes in total body water (TBW) due to removal of ascites. In 12 cirrhotic patients, BIA of the whole body and of body segments was performed before and after treatment of ascites with paracentesis (n = 12) and diuretics (n = 2). TBW changes predicted by BIA, by using two prediction equations, were significantly less than body weight changes (51% and 45% of the weight loss). BIA of body segments showed highly significant changes in both the trunk and the leg and small changes in the arm. These data indicate that BIA of the whole body is not a suitable technique for monitoring fluid changes in cirrhotic patients with ascites. Changes in BIA of body segments may be due to mobilization of edema after the removal of ascites."

Measurements by all methods are highly intercorrelated, but methods differences show the population means for fat percent to range from 26 to 35% of body weight across eight methods. All methods show increasing fat (as % body weight) with age in both sexes but vary in secular slope. The goal of this report is to provide direct translations between each of the eight methods.

CD009647,0,3120216,0,Obesity.,"Obesity is not a single disease, but a variety of conditions resulting from different mechanisms and associated with various types and degrees of risks. To determine who should lose weight, how much weight should be lost, and how to undertake weight loss, the following types of information are needed: personal-demographic data, developmental patterns, family history, energy balance, body composition/fat distribution, psychological/behavioral measures, endocrine/metabolic measures, complications and associated conditions. Weight reduction should be undertaken by women with morbid obesity, with complications secondary to the obesity, with a strong family history of conditions associated with obesity, or with increased abdomen:hip ratios. In contrast, women who have excess weight localized in the hips and thighs and no personal or family history of associated conditions may not benefit from dietary restriction. Low calorie diets result in adaptive changes, ""designed"" to prolong survival in the face of famine. These include changes in water balance, metabolic rate, and appetite. Metabolic rate declines, allowing the individual to burn fewer and fewer calories. Each time a woman diets she tends to lose weight less rapidly than the time before. ""Restrained eating"" predisposes binge eating. Indeed, bulimia rarely occurs in the absence of prior caloric restrictions. Current medical definitions of obesity do not consider these nuances. Existing definitions ""over-diagnose"" obesity in women, in general, and in older women and nonwhite women, in particular. For example, by existing standards, more than 60 percent of black women more than 45 years of age are considered obese. In contrast, the health risks of similar degrees of obesity are substantially greater for men than for women. Part of the problems lies in the fact that many women have pear-shaped fat distribution,a pattern which is not associated with increased health risks.Current cultural definitions of obesity for women distort the picture even further. In the past 20 years,there has been a progressive decline in the weight-for height of such ""culture models"" as Playboy centerfold subjects and Miss America contestants. Attempting to achieve such low weights predisposes women to an endless cycle of dieting and regaining, and contributes to the growing problems of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa and bulimia."
CD009647,0,15621783,0,Rituximab plus gemcitabine: a therapeutic option for elderly or frail patients with aggressive non Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"The standard treatment for patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma--particularly diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL)--is cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone [CHOP) plus rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the CD20 antigen. However, some patients are not fit enough to tolerate CHOP or they relapse after previous therapy with CHOP. Gemcitabine as a monotherapy is active and relatively non-toxic in the treatment of NHL. We investigated the toxicity and efficacy of a combination of gemcitabine with rituximab in a small series of elderly patients with high-grade B-cell lymphoma who had either a relapse after CHOP, or were medically unfit to tolerate CHOP as a first-line therapy. Gemcitabine was given at 1000 mg/m2/week x 3, q28 days; rituximab at 325 mg/m2/week x 4 in the first cycle, and on day 1 of all subsequent cycles. Seven patients have been treated. The median number of cycles given was 4. The major toxicity was haematologic: grade 3/4 leukocytopenia occurred in 4 patients, grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia in 3 patients. There were no episodes of clinically significant bleeding. One patient developed febrile neutropenia and died in the course of treatment; another patient developed non-Q-wave myocardial infarction possibly related to hydration pre-treatment to rituximab and erythrocyte transfusion. He recovered well after symptomatic therapy. In 7 patients, 2 complete and 3 partial remissions were achieved, with an estimated median time to progression of 12 months. This series of patients shows that the combination of gemcitabine and rituximab is feasible in this population not able to undergo standard poly-chemotherapy, shows promising activity, and merits further evaluation."

Complications of IV fluid administration include electrolyte abnormalities and fluid overload, which be detected by appropriate IV fluid administration and monitoring practices. This prospective clinical audit described the administration and monitoring of maintenance IV fluid in ward patients in an Australian tertiary teaching hospital. Of 332 inpatients (98%), 85 (26%) were receiving IV fluids. Serum electrolyte and renal function measurements were obtained in 85% versus 65% of patients receiving IV fluids versus no IV fluids (P < 0.001). Fluid balance charts were being maintained for 94% versus 44% of patients receiving IV fluids versus no IV fluids (P < 0.001). Body weight measurements were documented for 15% versus 14% for patients receiving IV fluids versus no IV fluids (P = 0.078). Findings show that approximately one-quarter of adult ward patients in our hospital received IV fluids. Monitoring of such patients using regular blood tests and fluid balance charts is high, but patient weight measurements are low. Why hospitalized patients who require maintenance IV fluids do not have regular body weight measurements requires further investigation."
CD009647,0,6845747,0,[Endangering the water-electrolyte balance in gastrointestinal diseases in the aged].,"In old people the range of operation, as well as the adaptability of the electrolyte and water metabolism, is reduced by the involutive reduction of the renal, pulmonary and endocrinic functions, as well as by a reduced feeling of thirst, a reduction of the buffer mechanisms, and a dwindling amount of body water. The threat to the maintenance of the requisite amount of body-water and to a normal electrolysis, caused by gastro-intestinal illnesses, is discussed from the point of view of geriatrics. Hydro-mineral upsets occurring in gastroenterology are primarily caused either by an inadequate supply, inadequate absorption, or by an extra-ordinary loss of intestinal secretions, as well as by interference with the normal electrolyte and water metabolism due to medical treatment. Situations in which such hydro-mineral disturbances wright occur are indicated and therapeutic measures suggested. We assert and prove that in old people the danger of extreme reduction of body-water and electrolysis frequently presents a greater threat to life than the illness from which it proceeds, and we maintain that a due consideration of this problem can in many cases literally save the life of the old patient."
CD009647,0,6372563,0,Renal response to captopril in severe heart failure: role of furosemide in natriuresis and reversal of hyponatremia.,"To assess the effect of furosemide and captopril on renal function and hyponatremia in patients with severe heart failure, we studied two groups of patients with hyponatremia who were receiving digoxin therapy and whose sodium intake was 40 meq/d. One group received captopril and furosemide, the second received captopril. The first group responded to combination therapy with a brisk natriuresis and diuresis, weight reduction, and an increase in serum sodium concentration. Patients who received captopril alone did not respond, despite a similar increase in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. When furosemide was then administered to patients who had received captopril alone, a brisk natriuresis, weight loss, and correction of hyponatremia followed. Treatment with furosemide is necessary to promote natriuresis and correction of hyponatremia in patients with severe heart failure treated with captopril; the renal vascular action of captopril enhances the effectiveness of furosemide."
CD009647,0,20166546,0,[Clinical characteristics of five elderly patients with severe hypokalemia induced by glycyrrhizin derivatives].,"Although hypokalemia is a common clinical problem, symptoms generally do not become manifest unless the serum potassium (K) falls rapidly. We encountered five cases with symptomatic severe hypokalemia (K<2.0 mEq/L) hospitalized for the past 15 months at our hospital. We examined the clinical characteristics and treatment of these patients. All five patients were women, and their mean age was 77.8 (73-82)years. They suffered from hypertension. Mean K level at admission was 1.66 (1.4-1.9) mEq/L and HCO3(-) was 48.3 (33.6-56.1) mmol/L. Plasma aldosterone level was low and plasma rennin activity was suppressed. All patients developed progressive muscle weakness with elevated creatinine phosphokinase. Three of the patients had received Chinese medicine which contained licorice, one received glycyrrhizin and the other one had received both. We diagnosed these cases as pseudoaldosteronism induced by glycyrrhizin. With discontinuation of the drugs and intravenous as well as oral K supplementation, serum K were normalized and clinical symptoms improved within 12 days. For one patient who developed cardiac dysfunction, concentrated K solution (230 mEq/L) was infused into the central vein. These findings show that glycyrrhizin ingestion should be kept in mind as a cause of an extreme degree of an hypokalemia, especially in elderly patients."

Metabolic expenditure postoperatively remained within 5--10% of preoperative values. Net nitrogen loss for the postoperative period was less than 35 gm for the first 4 postoperative days, well below changes seen in major nonsurgical trauma. Fluid balance was positive in all patients for the first 4 postoperative days. Patients not in negative fluid balance by the fourth postoperative day should be closely monitored for complications. Recognition of delayed fluid excretion is essential in order to avoid the complications of further fluid loading in the postoperative period.

They are chronic, unpleasant skin manifestations with a strong negative impact on patients' quality of life, often inducing sleeplessness and mood disorders. The pathogenesis of skin xerosis (SX) and uraemic pruritus (UP) are multifactorial. Moisturizing emollients are commonly used for the treatment of SX and UP. Urea is used in dermatology due to its excellent hydrating and moisturizing properties. Urea is useful in all cases of dry skin and, depending on the concentration levels, will act as moisturizing or keratolitic agent. Ureadin Rx 10 is a topical hydrating and emollient lotion formulation. So far no data are available regarding the efficacy of topical application of urea in lotion in the treatment of SX and UP in dialysed patients.

CD009647,0,10198529,0,Estimation of non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema using dual-frequency electrical impedance.,"The study investigates the effects of non-cardiogenic oedema, especially the accumulation of protein in extracellular fluid, on thoracic impedance and proposes a new method of oedema measurement based on an impedance ratio from a dual-frequency measurement. In vitro measurements in a cell containing an albumin-in-saline solution yield a resistance increase when the albumin concentration increases. Subsequently, 13 patients having acute respiratory failure are measured. The single-frequency Z0 measurements and the proposed impedance ratio are compared with extravascular lung water (EVLW) determined by the double indicator dilution method. The single-frequency measurement correlates poorly with EVLW (r = -0.24, p = 0.56). In some patients, a total thoracic impedance increase is found with increasing EVLW. The correlation between the impedance ratio and EVLW is r = -0.79 (p < 0.0005). The ratio decreases as EVLW increases. Thus, when oedema is measured using bio-impedance, cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic oedema yield different results. It is well recognised that cardiogenic oedema decreases total thoracic impedance. In non-cardiogenic oedema, however, protein accumulation causes an impedance increase. The decrease in the impedance ratio as EVLW increases can be explained by the accumulation of albumin in the extracellular compartment."

Common clinical conditions associated with abnormal blood pressure homeostasis and falls in the elderly include postural hypotension, postprandial hypotension, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, and cardiac arrhythmias, all of which are exacerbated by hypertension. Further research is needed to understand the physiologic basis of abnormal blood pressure homeostasis, to explore the potential relationship between hypertension and falling, and to design new therapeutic approaches to this important cause of falls in the elderly."
CD009647,0,15669603,0,Successful management of infertility due to retrograde ejaculation using assisted reproductive technologies: a report of two cases.,"Although retrograde ejaculation is a relatively uncommon cause of infertility, it is nonetheless the most common cause of ejaculatory dysfunction. Retrograde ejaculation is characterized by either all or part of the seminal fluid going into the bladder. The initial management of patients with ejaculatory dysfunction is medical therapy. In couples who have failed medical therapy, assisted reproductive techniques using sperm harvested from either the urine or the male reproductive tract would be the ultimate option. We report successful management of two couples, both men with advanced age and complete retrograde ejaculation, by intrauterine insemination in one and in vitro fertilization (IVF) using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the other using sperm harvested from urine. The cases reported herein suggest that male infertility due to retrograde ejaculation may be successfully treated in men significantly older than the usual reproductive age and that traditional methods of hydration and urine alkalinization allow for the successful recovery of fertile sperm for ART. The selection of the method of ART must be individualized to the needs of each couple based upon both male and female factors."
CD009647,0,2181783,0,[Continuous measurement of blood volume changes in hemodialysis using an ultrasound method].,"Haemodialysis treatment comprises the removal of surplus body water, mainly by ultrafiltration. Frequent complications, such as hypotension, are believed to be related to an imbalance between blood volume reduction, based upon ultrafiltration, and vascular refilling. The control of fluid balance can be achieved by the measurement of blood volume changes. A new method of determining total blood protein concentration by ultrasonic means facilitates continuous monitoring of blood volume changes during haemodialysis. Blood volume monitoring was undertaken during 38 haemodialysis treatments (19 patients) in order to achieve a better adjustment of the patient's estimated dry weight. The relative change in blood volume was registered in 11 patients who were first ultrafiltrated to their estimated dry weight. In a following session the ultrafiltration was increased by 10%. The relative change in blood volume, normalized to the change in total body water, increased significantly from 1.16 +/- 1.11% (normal ultrafiltration) to 1.67 +/- 0.8% (normal ultrafiltration + 10%) (p less than 0.05). Thus, normalized blood volume reduction may serve as an approximation to adjust the patient's dry weight."
CD009647,0,2445368,0,Influence of variations in blood haemoglobin concentration on the calculation of blood loss and volumetric irrigating fluid balance during transurethral resection of the prostate.,"Blood loss in 38 patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was calculated in four different ways by using various reference blood haemoglobin determinations (B-Hb) during the course of preparation and surgery. Blood loss became greater the later the B-Hb was drawn. This increase was because variations in B-Hb acted to underestimate the loss of plasma. The variations also distorted the irrigating fluid balance to give too low values for the absorption of irrigating fluid. It is possible to correct for the errors in blood loss and volumetric fluid balance by the use of haemodilution factors. Haemodilution was greater in patients with complications such as absorption of irrigating fluid or excessive blood loss than in patients without such features if Ringer's acetate was used for i.v. fluid supplementation. With dextran 40, all patients had a similar degree of haemodilution."

No significant differences in dietary intake or metabolic rate were found between patients with cancer and those with benign disease. There were significant positive correlations between protein and energy intakes and the ratio of total body potassium to total body water in patients with benign disease but not in those with cancer.

An evident loss in body weight was observed in patients undergoing incomplete nutrition, not justified by a moderately negative water balance. Statistical comparison of the two groups showed equal or positive balances for group 1 while group 2 gave negative results for all the parameters, particularly for nitrogen and potassium, suggestive of a loss in lean body mass greater than that usually occurring after simple fasting. Results confirmed the poor significance of serum values in expressing even significant degrees of electrolyte depletion.

On physical examination the abdomen was swollen and pressure sensitive. She had a leukocytosis (11,400/microliter) and hypokalaemia (3.6 mmol/l). X-ray films of the chest and abdomen revealed a large gastric air-bubble with two fluid levels of different height and an elevated left diaphragm, findings which suggested gastric volvulus. Most of the fluid was evacuated via a nasogastric tube. The stomach interior was difficult to examine by gastroscopy: it was only after withdrawal of the gastroscope from the duodenum that a normal gastric architecture was demonstrated, the volvulus apparently having been reduced during the gastroscopy. The gastric mucosa showed ulcerations and erosions. Gastropexy by gluing together the peritoneal layers was undertaken via dual percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.

She was brought to the emergency department with acute-onset of left-sided chest pain and clinical signs of hypovolemia. Bleeding control was difficult in the first operation because the tissue was friable and there were multiple subcutaneous bleeding points. During the first operation, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation, which required immediate management; therefore, the surgery was aborted and a repeat surgery was performed later to stop the bleeding. The major cause of bleeding was presumed to be the mechanical stretching of the intercostal arteries and branches of the internal thoracic artery secondary to the severe deformity of the thoracic vertebra and ribs. The massive bleeding remained as a hematoma and did not lead to development of hemothorax. This was believed to be because the giant intrathoracic meningocele supported the expansion of the hematoma and prevented the perforation of the visceral pleura. After the second operation, the hematoma shrunk gradually; however, the patient required ventilatory support because the decrease in the size of the hematoma was accompanied by the expansion of the meningocele."
CD009647,0,12093319,0,Ethical challenges in end-of-life therapies in the elderly.,"With the increasing numbers of elderly in the population of all western countries and the increasing life expectancy at birth, many seniors spend the last period of their life with various afflictions that may require the need for long-term institutional care. During the last period of life, many seniors and their families face decisions that challenge ethical principles and may cause conflict among family members as well as healthcare professionals. The commonly used ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice, although forming a useful foundation for the evaluation of decision-making dilemmas, alone cannot resolve many clinically challenging situations. Healthcare professionals must clearly understand the clinical state of the patient for whom a difficult decision is being contemplated. Levels of function, clinical symptoms, the expected trajectory of change and possible treatment options have to be balanced against the person's values and wishes, either self-expressed directly or through an advance directive, or communicated by surrogate decision makers. At times, physicians face difficult treatment dilemmas when patients or families request treatments that are not legally sanctioned, such as when physician-assisted suicide is requested by a suffering patient. At other times conflicts occur when patients or surrogates wish to continue with therapies that are no longer considered necessary or suitable by the physician. At the societal level, sometimes an expensive drug that is deemed necessary by the physicians is not covered by a government-sponsored or private health plan. The issue of distributive justice must be considered in a situation such as when long-term facilities or acute hospitals treating frail, cognitively impaired elders consider withholding or withdrawing various treatments because of poor clinical outcomes coupled with excessive costs. The often controversial issue of nutrition and hydration in the end-of-life period frequently causes treatment conflicts and dilemmas among surrogates and staff, as does the highly charged issue of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in this frail and very vulnerable population. The real challenge for healthcare providers in the field of geriatric long-term care is to balance compassionate and appropriate care with respect for the choices and wishes of patients and their families. This should be accomplished while at the same time safeguarding the professional standards and ethical integrity of healthcare providers responsible for this care."

The complications were discussed at monthly multidisciplinary complication meetings, which we organise from 2007 and which are aimed at improving care processes. The first patient developed urinary tract infection, fever and delirium and an arm fracture as a result of a fall after she had been given a routine urinary catheter in order to monitor her fluid balance. The complication discussion indicated that a urinary catheter should not be routinely installed. The second patient developed phlebitis and endocarditis after a venous infusion had been present for several days. As a result of the complication discussion it was decided that venous access was to be renewed after 96 h. The third patient, who was treated for atrial fibrillation, had fatal intracerebral bleeding due to INR > 5. A result of the complication discussion was that active antagonism of anticoagulants is warranted in these cases, not just discontinuation of the anticoagulants. The monthly multidisciplinary complication discussions in our department have led to a change in culture, facilitating the expression of doubts and criticisms, and a readiness to change policies."

More recently, these therapies have received attention for non-renal application such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure. To assess the potential benefits of CHF/CHD in the management of severe impairment of pulmonary gas exchange, we evaluated a series of clinical variables in a group of patients with acute respiratory failure complicated with acute renal failure. In 9 of 15 patients, pulmonary gas exchange was improved. Intrapulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) and pulmonary vascular resistance were also improved during the therapies. The beneficial effects of the modalities seems to be induced by effective removal of extravascular lung water. However, the fact that the same effects were also observed in a few patients with zero or positive fluid balance may indicate the possibility of elimination of circulating middle-molecular pulmonary toxic mediators. We concluded CHF/CHD are recommendable methods for the management of acutely ill patients with respiratory failure."

CD009647,0,6159369,0,Human alpha 1-microglobulin levels in various body fluids.,"alpha 1-Microglobulin levels in serum and urine were estimated by using single radial immunodiffusion, resulting in the following mean values: umbilical cord blood serum, 40.6 mg/l; normal adult serum, 44.2 mg/l; and normal urine, 5.7 mg/24 h urine volume. Slightly higher levels of serum alpha 1-microglobulin were found in infants and the aged. Serum and urine alpha 1-microglobulin levels in patients with renal failure, however, were greatly increased, mean levels being 231.5 mg/l and 100.7 mg/24 h urine volume, respectively. Serum alpha 1-microglobulin levels in these patients correlated well with both serum creatinine and beta 2-microglobulin levels. Serum alpha 1-microglobulin level did not correlate positively with serum levels of other plasma proteins, such as alpha 1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, complement, etc. Ouchterlony immunodiffusion also revealed the presence of alpha 1-microglobulin in synovial fluid, ascites, pleural effusion, amniotic fluid, cyst fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid. The levels of alpha 1-microglobulin in these fluids were measured by single radial immunodiffusion, except that its level in cerebrospinal fluid was measured by radioimmunoassay. Mean alpha 1-microglobulin concentration was 20.8 mg/l in synovial fluid, 28.7 mg/l in ascites, 21.5 mg/l in pleural effusion, 2.7 mg/l in amniotic fluid, 8.2 mg/l in cyst fluid, and 42.3 ng/ml in cerebrospinal fluid."

CD009647,0,7470828,0,Arginine vasopressin release following surgical operations.,"A study of plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations in 16 patients undergoing uncomplicated cholecystectomy was carried out to determine the relative importance of the various stimuli to AVP secretion during and after an operation. Eight of the 16 patients were given a high epidural blockade from T4 and T12 and blood samples were taken before, at frequent intervals during and for two days after operation for determination of plasma AVP and osmolarity; systolic blood pressure was measured each time a blood sample was taken. In the 16 patients there was a 1.8-fold rise of plasma AVP after induction of anaesthesia (from 1.7 pmol/l median basal value to 13.1 pmol/l) and an 8.8-fold rise after skin incision, the highest concentration during operation being 102 pmol/l. There was no significant difference in AVP concentrations, urine volumes or plasma osmolality in the control and epidural groups. Systolic blood pressure fell in all patients during operation by between 14 and 54 per cent, the fall being significantly greater in the epidural group. Notwithstanding the evidence that certain nervous impulses do cause an increased secretion of AVP during operation, these results clearly show that in the absence of such stimuli there is still an increased secretion, almost certainly caused by a fall in the blood pressure."

CD009647,0,9177415,0,Increased concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor in cyst fluid of enlarging and recurrent thyroid nodules.,"Human thyrocytes produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor, also known as vascular permeability factor (VPF), which increases vascular permeability. Based on the assumption that VEGF/VPF is involved in fluid accumulation in thyroid cysts, we determined the VEGF/VPF concentration in cyst fluids of thyroid nodules from 79 patients. VEGF/VPF was found to be abundantly present in the cyst fluids (0.02-183 ng/mL). There was no significant difference of VEGF/VPF concentration in the cyst fluid obtained from thyroid adenoma or from adenomotous goiter with cystic degeneration. Immunoreactive VEGF/VPF in cyst fluid was eluted mainly at 45 kDa, and stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, which was partially blocked by anti-VEGF/VPF antibody. The VEGF/ VPF concentration in the cyst fluid obtained from patients who required repeated aspiration or underwent surgical resection because of recurrent accumulation (84.8 +/- 58.3 ng/mL, mean +/- SD, n = 18) was significantly higher than that in the cysts that regressed or disappeared after a single aspiration (4.3 +/- 4.4 ng/mL, n = 12, P < 0.001). These in vitro and clinical findings suggest that VEGF/VPF is at least partly involved in the accumulation of cyst fluid in thyroid nodules, and that a high VEGF/VPF concentration predicts rapid accumulation of the cyst fluid, possibly necessitating interventional treatment."

CD009647,0,539466,0,Lithium treatment and kidney function. A survey of 237 patients in long-term treatment.,"Kidney function has been examined in 237 patients who in the autumn of 1977 were in lithium treatment at the Psychiatric Hospital in Risskov, most of them as outpatients. The average age was 42 years. The patients had been given lithium treatment for 0.5-17 years, mean duration 5 years. The mean lithium dosage was 33 mmol/day and the mean 12-hour serum lithium concentration 0.85 mmol/l. Glomerular filtration rate was assessed through determination of 24-hour creatinine clearance and serum creatinine, in some cases iothalamate clearance. Water excretion was assessed through determination of 24-hour urine volume and in some cases urine osmolality after 26 hours of fluid deprivation. Creatinine clearances, serum creatinine concentrations, and urine volumes were subjected to multiple regression analysis with various clinically relevant predictor variables. Affection of glomerular filtration rate was only moderate and progressed slowly. The data indicate that the risk of renal insufficiency and terminal azotemia is remote even when lithium is given for many years. A large number of the patients had altered water excretion with polyuria or lowered urine concentrating ability or both. Due to the extra fluid loss these patients are apt to develop dehydration, and they may then be in danger of lithium poisoning. We hypothesize that lithium-induced changes of kidney function may become less frequent and less pronounced if patients are maintained at serum lithium levels somewhat lower than those employed in the group studied here. We recommend careful monitoring of serum lithium levels, regular control of kidney function, and extra caution when physical illness or additional drug treatment may lead to disturbance of fluid and electrolyte balance."
CD009647,0,11840379,0,Body composition and energy metabolism in chronic renal insufficiency.,"Malnutrition and wasting are important determinants of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis. The aim of this study was to determine body composition and energy metabolism in patients with chronic renal insufficiency before dialysis. We compared 15 patients (9 women and 6 men) with chronic renal failure (creatinine, 1.5 to 4.2 mg/dL) with 15 normal subjects pair-matched for sex, age (renal failure versus normal, 71 +/- 3 years versus 64 +/- 3 years), height (1.61 +/- 0.02 m versus 1.64 +/- 0.02 m), and weight (64.5 +/- 2.7 kg versus 66.4 +/- 1.5 kg). Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and total body water was measured by bioelectrical impedance. Energy metabolism was determined by indirect calorimetry. The average glomerular filtration rate for the patients with chronic renal insufficiency was 23.9 +/- 2.6 mL/min/1.73 m2. Lean body mass (41.1 +/- 2.0 kg versus 44.5 +/- 2.2 kg; P = 0.003) and bone mineral content (2.35 +/- 0.11 kg versus 2.72 +/- 0.12 kg; P = 0.007) were significantly lower in chronic renal insufficiency; however, fat body mass was the same (19.9 +/- 2.1 kg versus 19.1 +/- 1.4 kg; P = 0.68). Total body water was similar in renal failure (33.4 +/- 1.5 L versus 34.4 +/- 1.3 L; P = 0.13). Basal energy expenditure was significantly lower in chronic renal insufficiency (1,085 +/- 50 kcal/24 hours versus 1,280 +/- 54 kcal/24 hours; P = 0.02), even after adjustment for the differences in lean body mass. Daily caloric intake indicated energy intake was similar in the patients with chronic renal insufficiency and the controls. Patients with a relatively modest degree of chronic renal insufficiency are characterized by reduced lean body mass, bone mineral content, and basal energy expenditure. The determinants of lean body mass in chronic renal insufficiency require further investigation."
CD009647,0,10712317,0,Characterization of nonresponse to high caloric oral nutritional therapy in depleted patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Nutritional support can increase body weight and physiologic function in COPD, but there are some patients who do not respond to nutritional therapy. The aim of this prospective study was to describe the nonresponse to 8 wk of oral nutritional supplementation therapy (500 to 750 kcal/d extra), implemented in an inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program, with respect to lung function, body composition, energy balance, and systemic inflammatory profile in 24 (16 male) depleted patients with COPD. On the basis of the weight change after 8 wk, patients were divided into three groups (Group 1: weight gain < 2% of baseline body weight, n = 5; Group 2: weight gain 2 to 5%, n = 9; Group 3: weight gain >/= 5%, n = 10). Although no differences were seen in lung function and body composition, Group 1 was characterized by older age, a lower baseline dietary intake/resting energy expenditure (REE) ratio, and a greater number of users of continuous supplemental oxygen when compared with Group 3. In addition, Group 1 exhibited higher baseline concentrations of fasting glucose and LPS-binding protein than did Groups 2 and 3. The concentrations of the soluble TNF- receptors 55 and 75 were elevated in Groups 1 and 2 when compared with Group 3. Furthermore, a significant, inverse correlation coefficient between baseline dietary intake and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule was revealed (r = -0.50, p = 0.016). On linear regression analysis, age, baseline intake/REE ratio, sTNF-receptor 55, and extracellular/intracellular water (ECW/ICW) ratio were selected as independent, significant parameters contributing to a total explained variation of 78% in weight change after nutritional therapy. In conclusion, nonresponse to nutritional therapy in COPD is associated with ageing, relative anorexia, and an elevated systemic inflammatory response. Further research is needed to investigate whether these factors contribute to eventual disturbances in intermediary metabolism as reflected by the increased glucose concentration and ECW/ICW ratio."

A controlled clinical trial in gastroenterological patients requiring intravenous nutrition.,"The best nonprotein energy source for routine use in patients receiving intravenous nutrition (IVN) for short periods of time is not known. In particular the relative merits of glucose and fat remain controversial. The present study was undertaken to determine if a quantitative difference in the ability to retain nitrogen could be documented between these two energy sources. In a prospective study of two comparable groups of 16 gastroenterologic patients who received IVN for 2 wk the changes in body weight, fat, water, and protein that occurred were measured. The only difference in the IVN between the groups was the nonprotein energy source. Group I received hypertonic glucose alone (49.2 +/- 7.9 kcal/kg day), and group II received an intravenous fat emulsion (60% of the nonprotein energy) in addition to hypertonic glucose (51.5 +/- 5.0 kcal/kg/day). Significant weight gain occurred in both groups (p < 0.001). In group I this was acounted for by gains of water (p < 0.02) and fat (p < 0.01) but not of protein. Patients receiving glucose together with fat (group II) gained protein (p < 0.02), but the gains of fat and water were not significant. Our study shows that protein repletion was achieved with an intravenous fat emulsion over a 2-wk period and the problems of water retention which occurred in the patients fed with glucose alone was not present. The results suggest that the fat in conjunction with glucose may be more effective as an energy source than equicaloric amounts of glucose alone in the type of patients we have studied."

Equivalent resistivity of extra- and intracellular fluid (RE, RI, respectively) and the ratio RI/RE were calculated. The difference in mean RE between Groups 1 and 2 was significant (p less than 0.05). In four patients in Group 1 and nine in Group 2, simultaneous measurements were carried out on both legs. The differences between mean RE and RI/RE in Group 2 were significant (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.025, respectively). In these 13 patients, correlation coefficients between the ratio of cross-sectional areas of both legs, and both RE and RI/RE were -0.614 (p less than 0.05) and 0.805 (p less than 0.001), respectively.

CD009647,0,21518244,0,Variability of pulse wave velocity and mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients.,"We have already demonstrated that in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients, the cyclic variations in both hydration status and blood pressure are responsible for changes in pulse wave velocity (PWV). The aim of this study is to verify whether the cyclic variation of PWV influences mortality in dialysis patients. We studied 167 oligoanuric (urinary output <500 mL/day) patients on chronic standard bicarbonate HD for at least 6 months. They performed 3 HD sessions of 4 hours per week. Patients were classified into 3 groups: normal PWV before and after dialysis (LL); high PWV before and normal PWV after dialysis (HL); and high PWV before and after dialysis (HH). The carotid-femoral PWV was measured with an automated system using the foot-to-foot method. Analysis of variance was used to compare the different groups. The outcome event studied was all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. The PWV values observed were LL in 44 patients (26.3%); HL in 53 patients (31.8%); and HH in 70 patients (41.9%). The 3 groups of patients are homogenous for sex, age, and blood pressure. The HH group had a higher prevalence of (P<0.001) ASCVD. It is interesting that the distribution of patients in the 3 groups is correlated with the basal value of PWV. In fact, when the basal measure of PWV is elevated, there is a higher probability that an HD session cannot reduce PWV (<12 ms). A total of 53 patients (31.7%) died during the follow-up of 2 years: 5 patients in the LL group (11.4%); 16 in the HL group (30.2%); and 32 in the HH group (50.7%) (LL vs. HL, P=0.047; LL vs. HH, P<0.00001; HL vs. HH, P=0.034).

CD009647,0,19953261,0,Applicability of ELISA detection of statherin for forensic identification of saliva.,"Statherin is a low molecular-weight phosphoprotein secreted from the parotid gland. Statherin mRNA was previously reported to be a useful marker for mRNA-based saliva identification. In this study, applicability of ELISA detection of statherin for forensic identification of saliva was investigated. The specificity and sensitivity of ELISA for detection of statherin were compared with those of ELISA for α-amylase and the Phadebas® amylase test. Statherin was specifically detected in saliva but not in other body fluids. In addition, statherin was successfully detected in aged saliva stains, mixed body fluids-saliva stains, and simulated casework samples. On the other hand, although ELISA for α-amylase showed higher sensitivity than ELISA for statherin, it was not specific enough to identify saliva. The Phadebas® amylase test also showed positive results in other body fluids that are known to have α-amylase activity; however, it is easy to use for screening forensic casework samples. In conclusion, ELISA for detection of statherin developed in this study could be an effective tool for the forensic identification of saliva because of its specificity for saliva among other body fluids. Forensic casework samples should be tested by ELISA detection or mRNA-based analysis for statherin, depending on the condition of the sample, to supplement presumptive tests for α-amylase, such as the Phadebas® amylase test."

CD009647,0,22283705,0,"Morphometric analysis of intralobular, interlobular and pleural lymphatics in normal human lung.","In spite of their presumed relevance in maintaining interalveolar septal fluid homeostasis, the knowledge of the anatomy of human lung lymphatics is still incomplete. The recent discovery of reliable markers specific for lymphatic endothelium has led to the observation that, contrary to previous assumptions, human lymphatic vessels extend deep inside the pulmonary lobule in association with bronchioles, intralobular arterioles or small pulmonary veins. The aim of this study was to provide a morphometric characterization of lymphatic vessels in the periphery of the human lung. Human lung sections were immunolabelled with the lymphatic marker D2-40, followed by blood vessel staining with von Willebrand Factor. Lymphatic vessels were classified into: intralobular (including those associated with bronchovascular bundles, perivascular, peribronchiolar and interalveolar), pleural (in the connective tissue of the visceral pleura), and interlobular (in interlobular septa). The percentage area occupied by the lymphatic lumen was much greater in the interlobular septa and in the subpleural space than in the lobule. Most of the intralobular lymphatic vessels were in close contact with a blood vessel, either alone or within a bronchovascular bundle, whereas 7% were associated with a bronchiole and < 1% were not connected to blood vessels or bronchioles (interalveolar). Intralobular lymphatic size progressively decreased from bronchovascular through to peribronchiolar, perivascular and interalveolar lymphatics. Lymphatics associated with bronchovascular bundles had similar morphometric characteristics to pleural and interlobular lymphatics. Shape factors were similar across lymphatic populations, except that peribronchiolar lymphatics had a marginally increased roundness and circularity, suggesting a more regular shape due to increased filling, and interlobular lymphatics had greater elongation, due to a greater proportion of conducting lymphatics cut longitudinally. Unsupervised cluster analysis confirmed a marked heterogeneity of lymphatic vessels both within and between groups, with a cluster of smaller vessels specifically represented in perivascular and interalveolar lymphatics within the alveolar interstitium. Our data indicate that intralobular lymphatics are a heterogeneous population, including vessels surrounding the bronchovascular bundle analogous to the conducting vessels present in the pleural and interlobular septa, many small perivascular lymphatics responsible for maintaining fluid balance in the alveolar interstitium, and a minority of intermediate lymphatics draining the peripheral airways. These lymphatic populations could be differentially involved in the pathogenesis of diseases preferentially involving distinct lung compartments."
CD009647,0,8417092,0,Body composition of patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"Low body weight is frequently reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We sought to discover why by comparing the body composition of 28 cognitively normal elders and 23 institutionalized individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Body mass index was calculated from standing height and weight. Percentages of lean body mass, body fat, and body water were derived from bioimpedance measurements of resistance and reactance. Skinfold thickness was measured at seven body sites to estimate regional fat distribution. Variables were analyzed by analysis of variance with subjects grouped by cognitive status within gender. Activity level and age were not significant covariates. Both women and men with Alzheimer's disease weighed less than control subjects. Differences in body composition were more pronounced in women with Alzheimer's disease, who had lower body mass index (22.0 +/- 3.0 vs 26.1 +/- 5.1), higher percentage of lean body mass (73.8 +/- 5.1 vs 66.9 +/- 6.5), lower percentage of body fat (26.1 +/- 5.1 vs 33.1 +/- 6.5), and higher percentage of body water (55.8 +/- 5.0 vs 49.3 +/- 6.5) compared with control women. Except for lower body weight, the body composition of men with Alzheimer's disease was not significantly different from that of control men. Patients of both sexes with Alzheimer's disease had less truncal body fat compared with controls, which gave them a youthful body habitus. These differences were not accounted for by age, diet, or activity. Our findings indicate that patients with Alzheimer's disease have lower body weight and may require higher energy intake than cognitively normal elders."

HBS modulates BV contraction rates by adjusting the ultrafiltration rate (UFR) and the refilling rate by adjusting dialysate conductivity (DC) in order to obtain the desired pre-determined BV trajectories."

CD009647,0,18286788,0,Analysis of an integrated clinical decision support system in nursing home clinical information systems.,"This descriptive study evaluated a clinical decision support system (CDSS) in three nursing homes. The CDSS included alerts for decline in condition, improvement in condition, constipation, dehydration, loss of skin integrity, weight loss, and weight gain. Frequencies of alerts and their triggers were counted, and Spearman's rank correlations were determined between active alert frequency and number of secondary diagnoses. The most frequent alerts were for dehydration and improvement in condition. One significant positive correlation existed between number of secondary diagnoses and weight gain alert frequencies in residents with cerebral vascular accident. Health care leaders face challenges constructing an implementation strategy that addresses usability, ensures accuracy, and guides users to critical information about residents."
CD009647,0,10865731,0,Hydrational status assessed by bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy and dilution methods in patients with classical dengue fever.,"The effects of an episode of acute classical dengue fever on extracellular water (ECW), intracellular water (ICW), and total body water (TBW) were measured in nine patients using conventional dilution techniques; and the findings were compared with the outcome variables from whole body impedance spectroscopy (BIS), extracellular fluid resistance (Recf), and intracellular fluid resistance (Ricf). The patients were assessed on admission with febrile presentation (DI), at discharge after the defervescence of the fever cycle at about five days postadmission (DII), and seven days thereafter (DIII). As a reference group, 15 persons without acute or chronic illness were enrolled. Total body water was unaltered during the course of disease and was not different from that in normal healthy subjects. However, body water shifted from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment in patients from the acute phase to convalescence, as reflected in the ratios of ECW/TBW and ECW/ICW. These ratios were significantly higher in convalescent dengue patients (DIII) than in the reference group (p < 0.05). Increasing ECW, from the acute phase of the disease to convalescence, was associated with a significant decrease in Recf (719 +/- 95, 693 +/- 89, 643 +/- 81 omega; p < 0.0001) and in Recf/Ricf (p < 0.01). Recf and Recf/Ricf were higher in the acute phase (DI) of dengue fever compared to controls (p < 0.05). We conclude that dengue fever is characterized by a relative expansion of ECW during the course of disease and convalescence. BIS was sensitive in determining the hydrational profile in dengue fever patients."
CD009647,0,21035203,0,Thirst in the elderly with and without heart failure.,"Elderly patients with heart failure (HF) may be troubled by thirst, despite the fact that elderly have an impaired ability to sense thirst. The present study was undertaken to compare the intensity of thirst in patients with and without HF and to evaluate how this symptom relates to the health-related quality of life and indices of the fluid balance. Forty-eight patients (mean age 80 years) admitted to hospital with worsening HF (n = 23) or with other acute illness (n = 25) graded their thirst and estimated their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Serum sodium was measured and urine samples were assessed for color and electrolyte content. The HF patients reported significantly more intensive thirst (median = 75 mm) compared with those in the control group (median = 25 mm; p < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant relationship between thirst and HRQoL, which was low overall. Serum sodium and urine color did not differ significantly between the groups, but the urine of the HF patients had a lower sodium concentration and osmolality. We conclude that elderly patients with worsening HF have considerably increased thirst and, hence, intense thirst should be regarded as a symptom of HF."
CD009647,0,14587129,0,Lower urinary tract symptoms in the older male.,"Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common in older men and include urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia and slow stream. Traditionally, this symptom complex has been called benign prostatic hypertrophy or prostatism, yet such symptoms may also result from detrusor over-activity and/or excessive urine output. Clinical assessment of older men with LUTS is based on a careful history, a clinical examination and a check of the postvoid residual, with urodynamic studies reserved for select individuals. Factors such as mobility, constipation and fluid balance must also be considered. These combined with a variety of pharmacologic agents (antispasmodics, alpha-antagonists, 5 alpha reductase inhibitors) offer great potential for improving the quality of life of individuals with LUTS."
CD009647,0,7752486,0,[Parathyroid crisis].,"Parathyroid crisis is an unusual form of primary hyperparathyroidism characterized by life-threatening hypercalcemia. We encountered nine patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, who showed various clinical symptoms including psychoneurotic symptoms, as a result of marked hypercalcemia. The average age of the patients was 49 (29 to 77), with an even distribution between men and women. Marked hypercalcemia (16.1 +/- 2.0 mg/dl) was accompanied by high levels of parathyroid hormone. Physiological saline solution, furosemide and calcitonin were administered to the nine patients for ten to thirty-fore days, respectively, in order to correct hypercalcemia and dehydration, and then parathyroidectomy was performed. Postoperative courses were uneventful, and the psychoneurotic symptoms improved markedly. No renal or cardiac dysfunction was observed. Since surgery (parathyroidectomy) is effective for the present condition, it seems important to quickly relieve dehydration and to operate early rather than to offer prolonged treatment by medication."

CD009647,0,11932310,0,GH increases extracellular volume by stimulating sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron and preventing pressure natriuresis.,"Although sodium retention and volume expansion occur during GH administration, blood pressure is decreased or unchanged. The aim was to study the effect of short- and long-term GH replacement in adults on sodium balance, renal hemodynamics, and blood pressure. Ten adults with severe GH deficiency were included into a 7-d, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial followed by 12 months of open GH replacement. All measurements were performed under metabolic ward conditions. Extracellular water (ECW) was determined using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were assessed using renal paraminohippurate and Cr(51) EDTA clearances, respectively. Renal tubular sodium reabsorption was assessed using lithium clearance. Plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptides and brain natriuretic peptides (BNP) and 24-h urinary norepinephrine excretion were measured. Seven days of GH treatment decreased urinary sodium excretion. Lithium clearance as a marker of proximal renal tubular sodium reabsorption was unaffected by GH treatment. ECW was increased after both short- and long-term treatment. This increase was inversely correlated to the decrease in diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.70, P = 0.02) between baseline and 12 months. Short-term treatment increased PRA and decreased BNP. The increase in PRA correlated with an increase in 24-h urinary norepinephrine excretion (r = 0.77, P < 0.01). Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow did not change during treatment. The sodium- and water-retaining effect of GH takes place in the distal nephron. The sustained increase in ECW in response to GH is associated with an unchanged or decreased blood pressure. This together with unchanged or decreased atrial natriuretic peptides and BNP may prevent pressure-induced escape of sodium."
CD009647,0,10803857,0,Differential pharmacokinetics of lithium in elderly patients.,"The pharmacotherapeutic use of lithium in the elderly as acute and maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder and augmentation therapy for major depression is well documented. Differences in the response to lithium are explained, in part, by the effect of age-related physiological changes, comorbid conditions, and concurrent medications on the pharmacokinetics of lithium in the elderly. The pharmacokinetic profile of lithium has been studied for many years, primarily in younger adult populations. Lithium pharmacokinetics may be influenced by a number of factors including age. It was first noted several years ago that elderly individuals required lower doses of lithium to achieve serum concentrations similar to those observed in younger adults. This is due to the combination of a reduced volume of distribution and reduced renal clearance. The composition of the human body changes with aging producing an increase in body fat, a decrease in fat-free mass and a decrease in total body water. Lithium clearance decreases as the glomerular filtration rate decreases with increasing age. The effects of other medical conditions in the elderly on the pharmacokinetics of lithium are less well delineated. Reduced lithium clearance is expected in patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure or renal dysfunction. Larger lithium maintenance doses are required in obese compared with non-obese patients. The most clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions associated with lithium involve drugs which are commonly used in the elderly. Thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can increase serum lithium concentrations. The tolerability of lithium is lower in the elderly. Neurotoxicity clearly occurs in the elderly at concentrations considered 'therapeutic' in general adult populations. There are no placebo-controlled randomised trials of lithium in old age and recommendations for clinical use are based on extrapolations from pharmacokinetic studies, anecdotal reports from mixed age populations and clinical experience in old age psychiatry. Serum concentrations of lithium need to be markedly reduced in the elderly population and particularly so in the very old and frail elderly."
CD009647,0,7393077,0,Plasma potassium levels in hypertensive patients receiving fixed-combination diuretic therapy.,"Among 54 patients attending a hospital hypertension clinic and receiving the fixed-combination diuretic Moduretic (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg, amiloride 5 mg), there was a 44.4% incidence of hypokalaemia. The mean drop in plasma potassium level was 0.69 mmol/L (P less than 0.0001), the mean low level being 2.81 mmol/L. Seventy-four per cent of falls occurred within 52 weeks of the start of therapy, 19.5 weeks being the average period between a normal and a low plasma potassium level. There was no difference in the fall in potassium level between male and female subjects, and beta-blockers were not obviously protective, although there was a statistically significant smaller fall in potassium level in females treated with them. The clinical significance of the unexpected hypokalaemia is uncertain; but even with fixed-combination diuretics, it remains necessary to monitor the plasma potassium level regularly in order to avoid complicating situations. The results of the present study would cast doubt on the efficacy of 5 mg of amiloride with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide in fixed-combination form in preventing hypokalaemia in this clinical situation."

CD009647,0,9292070,0,Effects of xerosis and ageing on epidermal proliferation and differentiation.,"The hallmarks of dry skin (xerosis) are scaliness and loss of elasticity. Decreased hydration and a disturbed lipid content of the stratum corneum are also well-known features. The frequency of dry skin increases with ageing. The aim of this study was to examine if these known features of dry skin are related to changes in epidermal proliferation and differentiation. In addition, age-related changes in normal and in dry skin were examined: 62 volunteers were divided by clinical grading and biophysical measurements into groups with young/normal, young/dry, aged/normal and aged/dry skin. Biopsy samples from the lower legs (most severe dryness) were examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by immunohistochemistry for epidermal proliferation, epidermal keratins and cornified envelope proteins. There was a slight increase in proliferation in both groups with dry skin compared with normal skin of the corresponding age. In aged/normal compared with young/normal skin there was a significant decrease in proliferation. However, epidermal proliferation was the same in aged/dry skin as in young/normal skin. For epidermal differentiation, an age-independent decrease of keratins K1 and K10 and an associated increase in the basal keratins K5 and K14 was detected in dry skin. There was also an age-independent premature expression of the cornified envelope protein involucrin. In contrast, loricrin expression was not influenced by dry skin conditions. In summary, epidermal proliferation was significantly decreased in aged/normal compared with young/normal skin. Dry skin showed significant changes in the epidermal expression of basal and differentiation-related keratins, and a premature expression of involucrin irrespective of age."
CD009647,0,16351770,0,'Glucose control-related' and 'non-glucose control-related' effects of insulin on weight gain in newly insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients.,"Insulin use is common in type 2 diabetes and is frequently accompanied by weight gain, the composition of which is poorly understood. The present study evaluates insulin-induced body composition changes. Body weight and composition of thirty-two type 2 diabetic patients undergoing their first 12 months of insulin therapy were compared with those observed in thirty-two type 2 diabetic patients previously treated on insulin (minimum 1 year). Body composition was determined by simultaneous body water spaces (bioelectrical impedance analysis) and body density measurements. After 6 months, glycosylated Hb (HbA1c) significantly improved in the newly treated group (P<0.0001), but remained stable in those treated previously. HbA1c did not differ between 6 and 12 months in the two groups. Body weight significantly (P=0.04) changed over 12 months in those newly treated only (+2.8 kg), essentially comprising fat-free mass (P=0.044). Fat mass remained unchanged (P=0.85) as did total body water, while extracellular: total body water ratio tended to increase in those newly treated (P=0.059). Weight changes correlated with HbA1c changes (R2 0.134, P=0.002) in the initial 6 months only. Insulin therapy leads to weight gain (2.8 kg), predominantly fat-free mass, over 12 months. After 6 months, newly treated patients continued gaining weight despite an unchanged HbA1c, suggesting the potential anabolic role of insulin in subsequent gains. Therefore, in the initial 6 months, weight gain can be attributed to a 'glucose control-related effect' and further gain appears to be due to a 'non-glucose control-related' effect of insulin treatment."
CD009647,0,19758300,0,Bioreactance: a new tool for cardiac output and thoracic fluid content monitoring during hemodialysis.,"Outpatient hemodialysis therapy (HD) can be associated with hemodynamic compromise. Bioreactance has recently been shown to provide accurate, noninvasive, continuous, measurements of cardiac output (CO) and thoracic impedance (Zo) from which thoracic fluid content (TFC) can be derived assuming TFC=1000/Zo. This study was designed to evaluate the changes in TFC in comparison with the traditional indices of fluid removal (FR) and to understand the trends in CO changes in HD patients. Minute-by-minute changes in TFC and CO were prospectively collected using the bioreactance system (NICOM) in HD patients of a single unit. Changes in body weight (DeltaW), hematocrit (DeltaHct), and amount of FR were also measured. Twenty-five patients (age 77 +/- 11 years) were included. The TFC decreased in all patients by an average of 5.4 +/- 7.9 kohm(-1), weight decreased by 1.48 +/- 0.98 kg, and FR averaged 2.07 +/- 1.93 L over a 3- to 4-hour HD session. There were good correlations between DeltaTFC and DeltaW (R=0.80, P<0.0001) and FR (R=0.85, P<0.0001). DeltaHct (4.13 +/- 3.42%) was poorly correlated with DeltaTFC (R=0.35, P=0.12) and FR (R=0.40, P=0.07). The regression line between FR and TFC yielded FR=1.0024-0.1985TFC; thus, a 1 kohm(-1) change of Zo correlates with an approximately 200 mL change in total body water. The change in CO (-0.52 +/- 0.49 L/min m(2)) during HD did not correlate with FR (R=0.15, P=NS). Changes in TFC represented the monitored variable most closely related to FR. CO remained fairly constant in this stable patient cohort. Further studies in high-risk patients are warranted to understand whether TFC and CO monitoring can improve HD session management."
CD009647,0,3955502,0,Toxicity and complications of vascular isolation and hyperthermic perfusion with imidazole carboxamide (DTIC) in melanoma.,"The authors have used imidazole carboxamide (DTIC) in vascular isolation and hyperthermic perfusion for melanoma. The regional and systemic toxicity and complications of this procedure were studied in 40 cases with Stage III (15) and Stage I (25) melanoma. Technetium 99m-labelled serum albumin crossover and pharmacokinetic studies were done simultaneously to see if these correlate with toxicity. Local toxicity on muscles, nerves, skin, and arteries was conspicuously absent despite using dosages of 2 g/m2 (40-45 mg/kg) for the lower extremity and 1.2 g/m2 (24-28 mg/kg) for the upper extremity. Skin and core temperature were raised to 39 degrees C to 40 degrees C. Deep vein thrombosis was noted in three patients. No death or gangrene of the extremities occurred. Local infection was noted in only one patient. Fourteen patients (35%) manifested bone marrow toxicity (leukocyte count of 4000/mm3 or platelets of 100,000/mm3) in the second or third week after perfusion. Severe hematologic toxicity was seen in two instances. Dosages of DTIC greater than 40 mg/kg were associated with toxicity in 65% of the patients. No bleeding complications occurred in seven patients with thrombocytopenia. Measurement of crossover and recovery of radionuclide were not reliable indicators of subsequent systemic toxicity. Perfusion fluid balance data also were of no predictive value. Forty-seven percent of the administered DTIC was recovered in washout fluid. Of this, less than 2% was converted to its metabolites, that is aminoimidazole carboxamide and 2-azahypoxanthine. Thirty-five of 40 patients experienced mild nausea and vomiting. Transient and mild hepatotoxicity was noted in seven patients. It appears that DTIC hyperthermic isolation perfusion is a safe procedure, however, the total dosage should be below 40 mg/kg to avoid hematologic toxicity."
CD009647,0,17366051,0,A community outbreak of Legionnaires' disease from an industrial cooling tower: assessment of clinical features and diagnostic procedures.,"An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease (LD) occurred in Lidköping, Sweden, in August 2004. A cooling tower was identified as the probable source of infection. During the outbreak period an unexpected 3-6-fold increase in pneumonia patients was noted at the local hospital. During 7 weeks LD was diagnosed in 15 patients by urinary antigen and/or sputum culture. Additionally, 15 LD patients were diagnosed later by serology. Patients with LD were generally younger, more healthy, and more often smokers compared to other pneumonia patients. On admittance they had more severe symptoms with high fever and raised CRP levels, and more often hyponatraemia, gastrointestinal and CNS symptoms. A causative agent besides Legionella was found in 2 patients only. A significant titre rise for Mycoplasma and/or Chlamydophila pneumoniae was found in 13 of 29 tested patients with confirmed LD. We conclude that the clinical diagnosis of LD is difficult and that available diagnostic methods detect only a minority of patients in the acute phase. Therefore in severe pneumonia, empirically targeted therapy should be instituted on clinical grounds irrespective of the results of diagnostic tests. The observation of increased antibody levels for M. and C. pneumoniae suggests an unspecific immune reaction and merits further study."

CD009647,0,1669513,0,Measures of body composition. Their relationship to blood pressure and use in epidemiologic research.,"The association between ""overweight"" and increased risk of high blood pressure has long been recognized. The quantification of overweight into various aspects of body composition and the relationships of these aspects to blood pressure remain important areas of current research. The manner in which adipose tissue is distributed over the body is proving to be another important risk factor. Methodologies for assessing body composition include a variety of approaches commonly used in epidemiologic studies, ranging from simple indices (e.g., body mass index) to estimation of total body fat mass from equations based on skinfolds and other anthropometry, to newer approaches incorporating bioelectric impedance. Refined laboratory methods for assessing body composition are important in the study of small groups and in the development of predictive equations. These refined methods include the traditional approaches of hydrostatic weighing and K40 determinations, as well as newer improvements on these techniques incorporating estimates of bone mineral content and total body water. Other new sophisticated methodologies include dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. The approach to assessing body composition may vary among age groups; methodologies applicable to children may not work for the elderly."

Diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms and was confirmed by serology. Of the patients studied, 67% were men and 33% women, with a median age of 52 years (range of 23-76 years). Ten cases (67%) were diagnosed between May and July. Of all the patients, 93% had a history of contact with animals, mainly with sheep (11 patients, 73%), while 53% of them had a history of tick-bite (33%), or reported the presence of ticks in their environment (20%). The typical eschar lesion (tache noir) at the tick-bite site was present in 53% of the patients, while the rash was present in 87% of them. Laboratory findings included leukopenia (47%), thrombocytopenia (54%), elevation of transaminases (80%), hyponatremia (33%), and microscopic hematuria (80%).

CD009647,0,8528347,0,"Progressively increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 concentration in a hypoparathyroid patient with protracted hypercalcemia due to vitamin D2 intoxication.","A 76-year-old female patient who had been taking vitamin D2 100,000 U/day for more than 14 years due to hypoparathyroidism following total throidectomy was admitted because of protracted hypercalcemia. On admission, the levels of serum vitamin D2 (99.8 ng/ml) and 25-OHD2 (356 ng/ml) were very high, and 1,25-(OH)2D2 was low (4.0-18.7 pg/ml). Serum D3' 25-OHD3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3 were below the normal range. Despite intensive hydration with saline, intravenous hyperalimentation with phosphate- and calcium-free nutrients, and administration of glucocorticoid and calcitonin, the hypercalcemia persisted, accompanied by hypoproteinemia, edema, pleural effusion and congestive heart failure. The serum D2 and 25-OHD2 concentrations remained high and were accompanied by a gradual increase in 1,25-(OH)2D2 (121 pg/ml), which further increased after the administration of bisphosphonate (pamidronate) to 183 pg/ml. Seventeen months later, serum calcium and 1,25-(OH)2D2 were normalized but serum D2 and 25-OHD2 remained high. The serum 24,25-(OH)2D2/25-OHD2 ratio was relatively constant throughout her clinical course, whereas the low serum 1,25-(OH)2D2/25-OHD2 ratio at admission gradually increased during admission, suggesting that the increase in serum 1,25-(OH)2D2 is due to increased production rather than decreased degradation. The administration of pamidronate further increased serum 1,25-(OH)2D2. These features of the clinical course demonstrate that the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration in hypercalcemic patients with protracted vitamin D intoxication may be decreased, normal or increased. Possible factors responsible for a protracted increase in serum 1,25-(OH)2D2 are body weight loss, hypoproteinemia, and phosphate depletion. In addition, some bisphosphonates would certainly promote PTH-independent production of 1,25-(OH)2D2."
CD009647,0,1766643,0,Clinical assessment of corneal hydration control in Fuchs' dystrophy.,"The diagnosis and monitoring of Fuchs' disease is typically based on information obtained from patient symptoms and a slitlamp examination. Although this clinical information provides a basis for diagnosis, it does not give a quantitative method for charting the progression of the disease systematically or a reliable basis for predicting the cornea's capacity to remain transparent after stress (e.g., cataract extraction). However, it is possible to quantify overall corneal hydration control by inducing corneal swelling and then monitoring the deswelling rate expressed as percent recovery per hour (PRPH). We have tested subjects with Fuchs' dystrophy and found that the PRPH provides a reasonable estimate of corneal hydration control. Unfortunately, the PRPH procedure involves considerable time and technical assistance and therefore is not convenient for clinical practice. In this report, we document the results of an initial effort to explore the relations between PRPH and six clinical measures consisting of five biomicroscopic indices and a subjective synthesis of clinical information called the probability of decompensation (POD) based on these indices. PRPH was significantly related to striae (p less than 0.001), stromal haze (p = 0.025), microcysts (p less than 0.001), and the POD (p less than 0.001) and not significantly related to guttae (p = 0.252) or Descemet's folds (p = 0.185). An empirically weighted predictor of PRPH was constructed from a statistical analysis of five slitlamp assessments and age. This approach for synthesizing clinical information produced a result at least as good as that obtained from the POD summary. These results show an important link between a quantitative laboratory assessment of corneal function and a clinical evaluation of corneal status and suggest that with continued refinement, clinical assessment may provide more quantitative information on Fuch's dystrophy and other diseases that affect corneal status."

CD009647,0,11426285,0,Does aging change nutrition requirements?,"The current adult guidelines for a healthy diet make no distinctions between adults aged 25-50 y and those aged 51 y and over. The question is whether dietary guidelines ought to be stratified by age, in recognition of the dietary and nutrient needs of the growing population of elderly adults. There are limited data on nutrient requirements of older adults. Aging is accompanied by a variety of physiological, psychological, economic and social changes that may adversely affect nutritional status. Older people have a higher prevalence of chronic disease, take multiple medications and supplements, and tend to be sedentary. Higher prevalence of obesity is difficult to reconcile with sharply lowered energy intakes. While basal metabolic rate does decline with age, lack of physical activity among the elderly is the more likely answer. The USDA Food Guide Pyramid is the key tool for communicating dietary advice to consumers. Researchers at Tufts University have produced a 70+ pyramid to reflect the nutrient needs of elderly adults. An additional focus has been on quality of life issues. Increased longevity is not always associated with continued good health. The Healthy People 2010 Objectives now use quality of life as a national health standard. Whereas health related quality of life (HRQOL) measures assess physical and mental health and their determinants, global quality of life measures focus on life satisfaction. Optimal nutrition promotes both functional health status and mental well-being. Dietary diversity and variety promotes enjoyment and satisfaction with the diet. Regular physical activity promotes strength and endurance, helps to maintain appropriate body weight, and contributes to independent physical functioning. Improving health-related quality of life is a key element in promoting the health and well-being of older adults."

CD009647,0,7611582,0,[EEG changes during sedation with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid].,"Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a naturally occurring transmitter in the mammalian brain, related to sleep regulation and possibly to energy balance in diving or hibernating animals. It has been used for almost 35 years as an intravenous agent for induction of anaesthesia and for long-term sedation. Its convincing pharmacological properties, without serious adverse effects on circulation or respiration, are compromised by its unpredictable duration of action. This is not a major problem with long-term sedation during ICU treatment. GHB has been used with good results for sedation of patients with severe brain injury, where it compares favourably with barbiturates. In animal studies, it seems to possess a protective action against hypoxia on a cellular and whole organ level. However, in some experimental animals GHB has been shown to produce seizure-like activities, and the compound is being used to produce absence-like seizures. GHB has been used in our ICU for years to provide adequate sedation for patients under controlled ventilation or for patients fighting the respirator during spontaneous respiration. No serious side effects were observed in these patients, while in some patients under haemodialysis hypernatraemia and metabolic alkalosis developed; both were reversible after discontinuation of GHB and restriction of additional sodium input (Somsanit, the commercially available GHB preparation in Germany, contains 9.2 mmol sodium/g; the daily dose averages 20-40 g GHB, i.e. 180-370 mmol sodium). PATIENTS AND METHODS. In 31 patients after major abdominal surgery, sedation was established with GHB 50 mg/kg BW injected via perfusion pump over a 20-min period. No centrally acting medication had been given for at least 2 h. A computer-based multichannel EEG system (CATEEM, MediSyst, Linden) was used, allowing for fast Fourier transformation, spectral analysis and topographical brain mapping. EEG during induction of sedation was followed after a baseline EEG (10 min) had been recorded. Patients receiving long-term sedation were studied daily for an additional 15-min period. Corresponding well to the clinical findings, EEG pattern changed to a slow delta-theta or delta-only rhythm within 10 min of the start of injection. Alpha and beta power decreased, while delta activity exhibited an increase. All changes were most obvious in frontal and central areas of the brain. In about one out of three patients, a burst--suppression pattern developed. Since automatic processing of EEG may fail to detect special patterns like the looked-for 3/s spikes and waves, the raw EEG was analysed visually by an expert neurologist. Both processed and conventionally analysed EEG were free of any seizure-like electrical activity. CONCLUSION. We conclude that animal data may not apply to the use of GHB in humans, provided the dose is limited to the clinical needs. GHB is used in clinical practice in doses twice as high, or even higher, than the one we use for induction, without obvious side effects. However, the suppression of theta rhythm we observed in about half of the patients studied may indicate that even less than 50 mg/kg BW might be sufficient for adequate sedation."
CD009647,0,11209671,0,Physiological and haematological responses to cold exposure in the elderly.,"Throughout Europe, including Norway, increased winter mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is well described. However, while there are associations between high CVD mortality and cold climate, the reason for the excess deaths is not entirely known. Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that brief outdoor exposure to cold conditions may be linked to increased winter mortality in the elderly. However, the question as to whether alterations in the haemostatic system following exposure to cold could be responsible for the increased winter risk has been little investigated in elderly subjects. In this study, we have compared the effect of exposing lightly clothed healthy elderly men and women (60-70 years) for 90 minutes to either a mild cold stress (16 degrees C) or thermoneutral conditions (28 degrees C). Measurements of a variety of autonomic and haematological parameters were made in order to compare to what extent exposure to cold stress affects production of thrombogenic risk factors. The overall autonomic responses clearly showed that the subjects were mildly cold exposed. The main changes in the blood system were a cold exposure increase in hemoconcentration and an increase in the fibrinolytic parameter, t-PA. This coupled with other changes support previous findings and it is concluded that short term mild cold exposure in the elderly initiates a mild inflammatory reaction and a tendency for an increased state of hypercoagulability."

A major problem following renal transplantation is an abnormal diurnal rhythmicity in urine output. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the prevalence of nocturnal polyuria among renal transplant recipients in the early period after transplantation as well as at least 1 year after transplantation. We aimed to explore possible pathophysiological mechanisms behind nocturnal polyuria in this group of patients, focusing on the impact of blood pressure and medication."
CD009647,0,3925173,0,Response to total parenteral nutrition in the extremely malnourished patient.,"Changes in serum albumin levels and body weight are often used as indicators of the efficiency of a nutritional support regimen. Patients with moderate nutritional depletion demonstrate two distinct patterns of response during refeeding. The first is characterized by a decrease in the previously expanded extracellular fluid space with a rise in serum albumin and a loss of weight and the second by continued fluid retention with weight gain and no rise in serum albumin concentration. The second pattern has been observed in patients with ongoing stress such as infection. This study examines severely malnourished patients with no apparent inflammatory complications and demonstrates that this group responds to nutritional support in a pattern similar to that seen in the stressed patient. Eight patients with profound malnutrition were studied during the 1st week of nutritional support. Nitrogen balance was measured and the findings confirmed that all patients were anabolic. Sodium balances were used as an indicator of changes in the extracellular fluid compartment. Body weight and serum albumin were assessed daily. Body weight increased from 59 +/- 4 to 62 +/- 4% of normal (p less than 0.01) while serum albumin changed insignificantly (3.00 +/- 0.27 to 2.85 +/- 0.23 g/100 ml, NS) during the initial week of an adequate nutritional support regimen (nitrogen balance was +21.0 +/- 4.3 g, p less than 0.05). These changes were associated with a positive sodium balance (+215 +/- 20 mEq, p less than 0.05). These data confirm that some extremely malnourished patients do not experience a diuresis during the initial phase of nutritional support but rather may retain water and increase body weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,8573842,0,"Lean body mass estimation by creatinine kinetics, bioimpedance, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.","Lean body mass (LBM), which is fat free body mass, can be used as an index of nutritional status. We evaluated three techniques for LBM estimation, including dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), creatinine kinetics (CrKin), and bioimpedance (BI) in 10 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Two different formulae were applied for BI LBM estimation, Segal (S) and Deurenberg (D). Mean values (+/- SEM) of LBM estimated were 48.2 +/- 3.6, 46.12 +/- 2.87, 43.32 +/- 3.87, and 41.27 +/- 4.26 by DEXA, BI-S, BI-D, and CrKin, respectively. LBM by CrKin was significantly lower than that by DEXA and BI-S values. There was no statistically significant difference between DEXA and BI-S values. Statistically significant correlations were found between LBM values by all methods. Particularly strong correlations were found between DEXA versus BI-S (r = 0.976) and BI-S versus BI-D (r = 0.98). Because clinical assessment of hydration status is inaccurate, and both BI and DEXA measure excess extracellular water in LBM, falling muscle mass may be missed by these techniques. The CrKin technique for estimating LBM at normal body fluid volumes (dry weight) may be a better index of nutritional status in patients on CAPD because this may truly reflect the dry LBM and changes in muscle mass. Both DEXA and BI include excess body water in LBM and may mask malnutrition in the presence of subclinical or clinical overhydration, which is common in patients on peritoneal dialysis."

CD009647,0,9433708,0,Micronutrient status in patients receiving home parenteral nutrition.,"Administration of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) to patients with intestinal failure requires attention to caloric content of feeds, fluid, electrolyte balance, and micronutrient status. Peripheral blood estimations of vitamins and trace elements may be abnormal, but their clinical significance in relation to deficiency or toxicity states is not always clear. We sought to determine the incidence and nature of clinical micronutrient abnormality in our HPN program. Clinical assessment and case record review of 49 patients actively receiving HPN was undertaken, and, in 32 of these patients, serum micronutrient levels were assayed. Clinical evidence of micronutrient deficiency was identified in 16 patients (33%). Iron deficiency anemia occurred in 14 patients which resolved after iron supplementation in all except 1 patient who had persistent intestinal blood loss. Anemia was precipitated in six patients by identifiable clinical events (acute gastrointestinal disease in five and menorrhagia in one), and in two others folate deficiency coexisted. Biotin deficiency developed in three patients, manifested by dry eyes and angular cheilitis or hair loss. Vitamin A deficiency resulting in visual disturbance developed in one patient who was not receiving multivitamin supplements at that time. Serum levels of zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, vitamin A, and vitamin E were measured in 32 patients. No patient had normal levels of all six micronutrients. Nevertheless, there was no clinical evidence of toxicity or deficiency in any of these patients at the time assays were performed. In conclusion, abnormalities of micronutrient status are common in HPN patients, but serious sequelae appear to be unusual."
CD009647,0,8244049,0,Plasma DNA as cell death marker in elderly patients.,"Plasma DNA increases where cell death occurs in vivo. To investigate its significance in elderly patients, plasma DNA was assayed in 79 institutionalized patients over 68 years of age. The patients were divided into two groups: group I comprises 39 patients suffering from various acute or chronic illnesses; group II comprises 40 patients without chronic disease, and free of any clinical or biological symptoms of any infectious or inflammatory process. Plasma DNA was higher in group I than in group II (p < 0.0001) and in group II than in a control group of middle-aged subjects (p < 0.05). In group I, increase in plasma DNA concentration was found in various pathological situations associated with cell death phenomena, including infections, cancers with metastasis, hepatitis, irreversible cardiac failure, severe respiratory insufficiency and thrombophlebitis. Plasma DNA concentrations were not correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen concentration, hemoglobin concentration or leukocyte count. In group I, as well as in the overall population, survival after 1 month was significantly reduced in patients with increased concentrations of plasma DNA. In conclusion, plasma DNA as a marker of cell death phenomena occurring in vivo, could be helpful for follow-up and management of elderly patients."

Trypan blue 0.1% was used during surgery to stain the anterior capsule and enhance the contrast during capsulorhexis. Seven days after surgery, the patient presented with ""dark and double"" vision (monocular diplopia). The IOL was decentered superiorly and appeared dark blue. The lens was explanted 2 months after surgery and sent for gross and microscopic analyses in a dry state and after hydration. The same analyses were performed on 2 unused lenses of the same design that had been immersed in diluted trypan blue solutions (0.01% and 0.001%). On the explanted lens, the dark blue staining was denser in the optic, especially in its periphery. The blue discoloration could not be removed after 24 hours of lens immersion in a balanced salt solution at 37 degrees C. Permanent staining of the unused lenses was also obtained after immersion in the trypan blue solutions."
CD009647,0,10782977,0,A fatal case of chlorate poisoning: confirmation by ion chromatography of body fluids.,"A 49-year-old male chemical industry worker was admitted to intensive care with a 24-hour history of respiratory failure, vomiting, headache, stupor, arterial hypotension, and cyanosed face and limbs. He had acute haemolysis (3.9 g/L plasma haemoglobin concentration) and 30% methaemoglobinaemia. Whereas the search for alcohol, barbiturates and opiates was negative, benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants were present. The patient was in fact being treated with fluvoxamine, amitryptiline, and alprazolam. As the clinical and biological signs suggested chlorate poisoning, chlorate was looked for by using an aniline color reaction. It was found in gastric content and urine. Treatment consisted in mechanical ventilation, vasoactive amines, methylene blue, plasma exchange, exchange transfusion, and haemodialysis. Despite this, the patient had several cardiac arrests and refractory metabolic acidosis. He died 12 h after his admission. Specific ion chromatography was used afterhand to assay the chlorate in various body fluids. The technique was based on a separation on an ion exchange Dionex AS 12A column coupled with conductivity detection. A quantitative estimation was carried out by using external calibration with a four-point calibration curve which was linear between 1 and 15 mg/L. The measured plasma levels of chlorate were 78 and 29 mg/L respectively before and after exchange transfusion. Gastric-lavage liquid contained 1300 mg/L of chlorate and urine 4300 mg/L. Ion chromatography, which is routinely used in environmental studies helped to confirm a massive oral intake of chlorate by measuring the corresponding blood and urine chlorate concentrations, data which had only rarely been reported previously."
CD009647,0,1559507,0,Validation of body composition determination by bioelectrical impedance analysis in acromegaly.,"Body composition determination by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has been compared with measurement of total body water (TBW) by tritiated water dilution and estimation of body fat (BF) by measurement of TBW and total body potassium (TBK) in a four-compartment model, in patients with acromegaly. This disorder is accompanied by a profound aberration in body composition. Furthermore TBW and BF were predicted on the basis of anthropometric variables alone. Paired comparisons of TBW estimations by isotope dilution and BIA showed good correlation (Spearman's rank correlation 0.95, P less than 0.01). Isotope dilution resulted in a mean of 1.7 liter (standard deviation 1.87) higher values. Comparison of BF estimations showed also a significant correlation (Spearman's rank correlation 0.75, P less than 0.01), with slightly higher values for BIA (mean 1.4 kg; standard deviation 2.99). BIA improved the prediction of TBW and BF compared with predictions based on anthropometric variables. In a population of acromegalic patients, BIA seemed to be a useful method to estimate TBW and BF."
CD009647,0,16048663,0,Integrated nutrition.,"There is no branch of medicine in which nutritional considerations do not play some part. Overnutrition, undernutrition or unbalanced nutrition are the major causes of ill health in the world. Conversely, illness causes important nutritional and metabolic problems. The spectrum from lack to excess of nutrients is seamless as a clinical and scientific discipline, the two extremes being linked by the Barker effect by which intrauterine malnutrition and low birth weight predispose to obesity, diabetes and CVD in later life. However, the teaching of nutrition in medical and nursing schools remains sparse. Nutritional care cannot be practised satisfactorily in isolation from other aspects of management, since factors such as drugs, surgery and fluid and electrolyte balance affect nutritional status. Nutritional treatment may also have adverse or beneficial effects according to the composition, amount and mode of delivery of the diet and the clinical context in which it is given. Any benefits of nutritional support may also be negated by shortcomings in other aspects of treatment and must therefore be fully integrated into overall care. One example of this approach is the enhanced recovery after a surgery protocol incorporating immediate pre-operative carbohydrate and early post-operative oral intake with strict attention to zero fluid balance, epidural analgesia and early mobilisation. Other examples include the deleterious effect on surgical outcome of salt and water overload or hyperglycaemia, either of which may negate the benefits of nutritional support. There is a need, therefore, to integrate clinical nutrition more closely, not just into medical and surgical practice, but also into the organisation of health services in the hospital and the community, and into the training of doctors and nurses. Societies originally devoted to parenteral and enteral nutrition need to widen their scope to embrace wider aspects of clinical nutrition."
CD009647,0,20167702,0,Avosentan for overt diabetic nephropathy.,"In the short term, the endothelin antagonist avosentan reduces proteinuria, but whether this translates to protection from progressive loss of renal function is unknown. We examined the effects of avosentan on progression of overt diabetic nephropathy in a multicenter, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We randomly assigned 1392 participants with type 2 diabetes to oral avosentan (25 or 50 mg) or placebo in addition to continued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and/or angiotensin receptor blockade. The composite primary outcome was the time to doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, or death. Secondary outcomes included changes in albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and cardiovascular outcomes. We terminated the trial prematurely after a median follow-up of 4 months (maximum 16 months) because of an excess of cardiovascular events with avosentan. We did not detect a difference in the frequency of the primary outcome between groups. Avosentan significantly reduced ACR: In patients who were treated with avosentan 25 mg/d, 50 mg/d, and placebo, the median reduction in ACR was 44.3, 49.3, and 9.7%, respectively. Adverse events led to discontinuation of trial medication significantly more often for avosentan than for placebo (19.6 and 18.2 versus 11.5% for placebo), dominated by fluid overload and congestive heart failure; death occurred in 21 (4.6%; P = 0.225), 17 (3.6%; P = 0.194), and 12 (2.6%), respectively. In conclusion, avosentan reduces albuminuria when added to standard treatment in people with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy but induces significant fluid overload and congestive heart failure."

CD009647,0,8282133,0,[Increased plasma antidiuretic hormone in the presence of hyponatremia in primary hypothyroidism].,"A 70-year-old woman was admitted because of disturbance of her consciousness. Physical examinations and laboratory data suggested hypothyroidism. Primary hypothyroidism was subsequently confirmed with endocrinological examinations. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels were elevated despite severe hyponatremia. On admission, urinary sodium concentration was 10mEq/l. The patient was treated with saline intravenously; serum sodium level increased from 120 to 125mEq/l and urinary sodium concentration increased from 10 to 54mEq/l. Mental confusion developed and serum sodium level dropped with urinary sodium concentration above 20mEq/l when thyroid replacement was started with the cessation of saline infusion. The patient's state of consciousness, elevated ADH levels, decreased serum sodium level and urinary sodium concentration were improved by thyroid replacement together with hydrocortisone therapy. Effects of acute water loading were abnormal with the administration of iodothyronine (T3) alone but were normalized with the administration of hydrocortisone together with T3. On discharge she was treated with the oral administration of levothyroxine alone. Pituitary hormones were normal. These results suggest that the patient was in a state of hypoadrenocorticism. Impaired water excretion in a state of hypoadrenocorticism due to hypothyroidism may give rise to an inappropriate secretion of ADH thereby resulting in hyponatremia, which in turn leads to hypotonic dehydration induced by water intoxication."
CD009647,0,3179891,0,Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis: an alternative therapy for acute renal failure associated with critical illness.,"Critically ill patients often cannot tolerate conventional hemodialysis because of hemodynamic instability. Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration provides control of fluid and electrolyte balance but is inefficient in the management of azotemia. Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) combines dialysis with hemofiltration. We performed 15 CAVHD treatments of 2 or more days' duration in 12 critically ill patients aged 23 to 85 (mean 64.4) years who had acute oliguric renal failure as a component of multiple organ system failure and who were unsuitable for conventional hemodialysis. The total treatment time was 106 days. The serum creatinine and urea levels were controlled in all the patients during CAVHD. The ultrafiltrate losses were sufficient to allow appropriate nutrition and fluid administration and still maintain a negative fluid balance. Renal function returned in five patients (42%), of whom four survived to be discharged home. CAVHD is an effective means of managing acute oliguric renal failure in critically ill patients."

CD009647,0,22431578,0,Clinical significance of incident hypokalemia and hyperkalemia in treated hypertensive patients in the antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial.,"Concerns exist that diuretic-induced changes in serum potassium may have adverse effects in hypertensive patients. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, a large practice-based clinical trial, made it possible to examine consequences of observed changes in potassium during care in conventional practice settings. Normokalemic participants randomized to chlorthalidone (C) versus amlodipine or lisinopril as a first-step drug were stratified by year-1 potassium. Postyear-1 outcomes among hypokalemics (potassium, <3.5 mmol/L) and hyperkalemics (potassium, >5.4 mmol/L) were compared with normokalemics (potassium, 3.5-5.4 mmol/L). Year-1 hypokalemia incidence was 6.8%; incidence in C (12.9%) differed from amlodipine (2.1%; P<0.001) and lisinopril (1.0%; P<0.01). Hyperkalemia incidence (2.0%) was greater in lisinopril (3.6%) than in C (1.2%; P<0.01) or amlodipine (1.9%; P<0.01). Coronary heart disease occurred in 8.1% with hypokalemia, 8.0% with normokalemia, and 11.1% with hyperkalemia. Overall, mortality was higher in hypokalemics than in normokalemics (Cox hazard ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.02-1.44]) with statistically significant (interaction, P<0.01) disparity in hazard ratios for the 3 treatment arms (hazard ratios, C=1.21, amlodipine=1.60, lisinopril=3.82). Hyperkalemia was associated with increased risk of combined cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.15-2.18]) without significant treatment interactions. In conventional practice settings, the uncommon appearance of hyperkalemia was associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Hypokalemia was associated with increased mortality; however, the statistically significant heterogeneity in hazard ratios across treatment groups strongly suggests that the observed increase in mortality is unrelated to the specific effects of C. Thus, for most patients, concerns about potassium levels should not influence the clinician's decision about initiating hypertension treatment with low-moderate doses of thiazide diuretics (12.5-25.0 mg of C)."
CD009647,0,8604674,0,"Impact of hemodialysis on dual X-ray absorptiometry, bioelectrical impedance measurements, and anthropometry.","Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) performs noninvasive assessment of bone and soft tissue with high precision. However, soft tissue algorithms assume that 73.2% of the lean body mass is water, a potential source of error in fluid retention. We evaluated DXA (model QDR-2000; Hologic Inc, Waltham, MA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and simple anthropometry in 19 patients (9 women and 10 men, mean age 46 y) before and after hemodialysis, removing 0.9-4.3 L (x: 2.8L) of ultrafiltrate. The reduction in fat-free mass (FFM) measured by DXA was highly correlated with the ultrafiltrate, as determined by the reduction in gravimetric weight (r = 0.975, P < 0.0001; SEE: 233 g), whereas BIA was considerably less accurate in assessing FFM reductions (r = 0.66, P < 0.01; SEE: 757 g). Lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) was unaffected by dialysis, as were whole-body fat and BMD. Whole-body bone mineral content, however, was estimated to be 0.6% lower after dialysis. None of the simple anthropometric measurements correlated significantly with the reduction in FFM. In an unmodified clinical setting, DXA appears to be superior to other simple noninvasive methods for determining body composition, particularly when the emphasis is on repeated measurements."

Due to intolerance in 5% of the patients, the nutrition had to be interrupted. The other patients received 1500-2500 ml Nutro-Drip per 24 h (= 1605--2675 kcal = 6780-11300 J). Transient side effects were: diarrhoe 3,8%; nausea 0,8%; eructation and/or heartburn 1,1%; squeezing of the stomach 1,1%. In these patients nutrition with Nutro-Drip was not interrupted. The mean frequency of defecation was 0,81/day. There were no significant changes in body weight, serum electrolytes, water balance, blood sugar, liver enzymes, serum cholesterol, and acid-base balance during the feeding with Nutro-Drip. Immediately after surgery there was a statistically significant decrease in potassium, protein, and albumin levels in the serum with the tendency to normal values during Nutro-Drip feeding. During the postoperative period the urea content of the serum increased continuously without altering creatinin levels in the serum. Nutro-Drip seems to be very suitable for tube-feeding in patients with normal gastro-intestinal tract."
CD009647,0,1595029,0,Multivariate analysis of morbidity and mortality from the initial surgical management of obstructing carcinoma of the colon.,"Eighty consecutive patients presenting with complete large intestinal obstruction from primary carcinoma were evaluated. A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate perioperative morbidity and mortality. There were five deaths in the immediate postoperative period (30 days). Extensive and lesser complications occurred in eight and 11 patients, respectively. There were 25 lesions of the right colon, whereas in 55 patients, the lesion was located distal to the left branch of the middle colic artery. Females were more likely to present with obstructed carcinomas of the left colon than males. Patients with an obstruction of the left colon more frequently presented with dehydration than those with a tumor of the right colon (p less than 0.05). Most carcinomas of the right colon were resected, whereas lesions of the left colon were managed with diverting colostomy in 33 patients and by primary resection in 22. Thirteen patients with carcinomas of the left colon had an immediate anastomosis without mortality. Preoperative severe cardiopulmonary disease, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score and advanced carcinoma (Dukes' C or D) were statistically related to early hospital morbidity and mortality, while individual physiologic parameters, site of lesion or operation performed were not. Primary resection may be performed safely in selected patients. Multivariate assessment and clinical staging may allow for appropriate patient selection and improve immediate outcome."

CD009647,0,23062091,0,Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management.,"Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes."
CD009647,0,15909390,0,[Guideline 'Delirium'].,"The Dutch Association of Psychiatry, together with the Dutch Association of Clinical Geriatrics and with methodological support from the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement (CBO) has developed a guideline for the optimal diagnosis, treatment and prevention of delirium. Delirium is caused by somatic illness or the use of medication, drugs or alcohol. Delirium is common among the somatically ill admitted to a general hospital and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Important predisposing factors for delirium are: age > or =70 years, cognitive disturbances, sensory impairments, problems in daily activities, and the use of alcohol and opiates. Precipitating factors that may provoke delirium are: infection, fever, dehydration, serum electrolyte imbalance, polypharmacy, and the use of psychotropic medication, particularly anticholinergic drugs. Detection, diagnosis, and assessment of the severity of delirium are based on clinical examination, case history, observation, mental status examination including tests of cognitive function, and diagnosis of underlying somatic diseases. For daily practice, measurement tools are not necessary, nor are laboratory or imaging tests, such as electroencephalography. Haloperidol is the treatment of first choice for delirium due to somatic illness, except in patients with delirium due to drug use or medication, Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia. In cases of concurrent alcohol withdrawal syndrome, delirium may be treated with haloperidol and a benzodiazepine and B-vitamins. Medical and environmental interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium."

In a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial, we compared the efficacy of terlipressin combined with glyceryl trinitrate (TER-GTN), administered as early as possible to 76 patients with cirrhosis who had active GIB (84 bleeding episodes). Infusion was done at the patient's home by the physician on the emergency team (a mobile intensive care unit) if the patient had GIB and a history and clinical signs of cirrhosis. Patients received either an intravenous injection (1 to 2 mg) of TER-GTN or a double-placebo injection, and then another injection at 4 and 8 h. Control of bleeding, rebleeding, and mortality rate at days 15 and 42 were evaluated. In most patients, endoscopy confirmed the rupture of oesophageal varices (75.7%). Bleeding control was significantly better in the TER-GTN group (n = 41) than in the double-placebo group (n = 43) (p = 0.034). Mortality due to bleeding episodes was significantly lower in the TER-GTN group than in the double-placebo group at day 15 (p = 0.035) and at day 42 (p = 0.06). There were no serious side-effects. Early administration of TER-GTN lowers the deleterious consequences of prolonged hypovolaemia on the hepatic function of these patients."
CD009647,0,1311533,0,Modulation of plasma aldosterone by physiological changes in hydrogen ion concentration.,"To assess the effect of extracellular hydrogen ion concentration (PH+) on aldosterone secretion, studies in which other known modulators could be controlled were performed on 13 patients undergoing hemodialysis. High (35 mM) or low (14-17 mM) dialysate bicarbonate concentrations were utilized on separate days to either decrease or increase PH+, while plasma potassium concentrations (PK) were held at constant levels and changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) were minimized by avoiding changes in body weight. Changes in PH+ were associated with concordant changes in plasma aldosterone concentration (Pa) in both high- and low-bicarbonate studies. When these changes in Pa in high- and low-bicarbonate studies were analyzed together as a function of corresponding changes in PH+, a significant correlation could be demonstrated (r = 0.659, P less than 0.001). There was no correlation between changes in Pa and changes in PK, plasma sodium, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or PRA. Using the same methods to control PH+ and other variables during hemodialysis, the effects of altered PH+ on ACTH-stimulated aldosterone and cortisol secretion were evaluated in studies on six patients who received incremental infusions of ACTH after pretreatment with dexamethasone. In these studies, there was no demonstrable effect of PH+ on Pa or plasma cortisol concentration. We conclude that physiological changes in PH+ have a weak modulating effect on basal aldosterone secretion that may not be evident in the presence of other acutely applied stimuli."
CD009647,0,9061116,0,Hyperosmotic-hyperoncotic solutions during abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) resection.,"A largely positive perioperative fluid balance during both elective and emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (AAA) may put patients at risk of developing left ventricular failure and may thus contribute to morbidity. In the present paper we report on a prospective study using hyperosmotic-hyperonocotic solutions (HHS) infused during clamping of the aorta, for the prevention of declamping shock, and the associated reduction in perioperative fluid requirements. The major aim of this paper was to determine the efficacy of an HHS infusion when given over 20 minutes and to detect possible adverse effects of HHS. For perioperative fluid replacement 12 patients received crystalloid solutions with HHS [250 ml of 7.2% NaCl combined with either 6% Dextran (n = 3), 6% Hydroxyethylstarch (HES, n = 4) or 10% HES (n = 5)]. In 16 controls, crystalloids with 1000 ml of HES 10% were infused. Patients were invasively monitored and hemodynamic parameters frequently assessed during the operation, which were statistically analyzed in relation to the start of the fluid loading during clamping of the aorta. One patient showed an anaphylactoid reaction to HES, otherwise no side effects of HHS were observed during infusion (no hypotension, no pathological EKG changes). Plasma sodium and chloride concentration as well as osmolality rose resulting in an osmotic gradient and a desired intravascular volume expansion. Prior to declamping pulmonary capillary wedge pressure had increased to the desired value of > 13 mmHg and < 18 mmHg. Oxygen delivery was significantly elevated upon HHS and remained so post declamping, whereas no change was observed in controls. During clamping systemic vascular resistance was significantly decreased, but was unchanged in controls. The perioperative fluid balance of patients receiving HHS was 2471.0 +/- 948.6 ml, which was significantly less than + 3386.7 +/- 1247.9 ml of controls (P < 0.01). We suggest that HHS opens new perspectives in perioperative fluid management of both elective and emergency AAA repair, since hemodynamic parameters are improved and the overall fluid balance is less positive, thus decreasing the likelihood of edema formation. Moreover, the previously described positive microcirculatory effects of HHS may be particular beneficial in some high-risk patients."

CD009647,0,466057,0,Renal function after long-term treatment with lithium.,"Daily urine volumes, plasma creatinine concentrations, and creatinine clearance were measured in 106 patients with unipolar and bipolar affective disorders attending a ""lithium"" clinic. Urine volumes exceeded 3.51 in only six patients, plasma creatinine concentrations exceeded 150 mumol/1 (1.7 mg/100 ml) in only five, and creatinine clearance was below 50 ml/min in 16. Renal function was assessed by measuring creatinine clearance and renal tubular function, including response to 20 hours of water deprivation, in a representative sample of 30 patients from the lithium clinic and 30 psychiatric patients matched for age and sex who were taking other psychotropic drugs. Creatinine clearance and tubular function, including urine osmolality after water deprivation, were not significantly different between the two groups. Urinary excretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP), however, was much greater in the lithium-treated patients, who therefore had a diminished tubular responsiveness to AVP. The findings do not support suggestions that long-term lithium treatment results in seriously impaired renal function, renal damage, and polyuria. Compared with other series, however, the patients were being maintained with low serum lithium concentrations, which apparently area as effective prophylactically as higher concentrations."
CD009647,0,10617305,0,Changes in body composition during breast cancer chemotherapy with the CMF-regimen.,"Weight gain is a reported problem associated with adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and often generates psychosocial stress in women [1]. It also may affect prognosis and survival. Changes in body composition and weight during chemotherapy, particularly adjuvant treatment of breast carcinoma, have been previously reported [1-3]. Multiple reasons for this weight gain have been suggested though few theories have been scientifically validated [4]. The aim of this study was to investigate body composition and its relationship to weight change associated with the CMF-based breast cancer chemotherapy protocols. Total body nitrogen (TBN), body fat, total body water (TBW), and anthropometric measurements were conducted on 25 female out-patients (median age 47, range 26-70 years) receiving adjuvant CMF-based chemotherapy for breast cancer. Total body nitrogen was measured using the In Vivo Neutron Capture Analysis (IVNCA) technique (on day 1 of cycles 2-6) and TBP was calculated by multiplying TBN by 6.25 [5]. Nitrogen Index (NI) was calculated by expressing TBN as a percentage of normal. There was a significant increase in mean body weight during chemotherapy of 2.35 kg (p < 0.0001). Serial measurements showed no significant change in mean TBN, NI, or percentage body fat. Break down of body weight showed a significant increase in mean TBW of 0.79 kg (p = 0.003) and mean fat mass of 1.49 kg (p = 0.008). We conclude that weight gain observed during adjuvant chemotherapy for breast carcinoma is primarily due to an increase in fat and TBW."

CD009647,0,9795784,0,Bioelectrical impedance analysis predicts outcome in patients with suspected bacteremia.,"Fluid shifts from intracellular to extracellular water (ICW to ECW) are a feature of sepsis, caused by increased vascular permeability and cell catabolism. Changes in ECW and total body water (TBW) were assessed in a prospective observational study of patients with bacteremia by a bedside technique, and its prognostic impact determined. In 78 hospital patients with fever, the resistance ratio (Rinf/RO) and estimated ECW/TBW ratio from multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis, and f1p4m albumin concentration were measured. Rinf/RO and ECW/TBW ratios decreased from day 0 to 2 in patients with significant bacteremia (n = 31), but not in patients with doubtful or negative blood cultures (n = 22 and 25). Increased Rinf/RO at baseline, and further increase of ECW/TBW from day 0 to 2, were associated with lower rate of recovery after 1 week and with higher mortality. Baseline Rinf/RO above the median (0.75) had positive and negative predictive values of 0.31 and 0.95 for death. This prognostic effect was independent of underlying disease and blood culture result in a multivariate model. Hypoalbuminemia at baseline was predictive of outcome, but changes in albumin from day 0 to 2 were unrelated to blood culture results or outcome. In patients with bacteremia, fluid shifts from intracellular to extracellular water occur early, are rapidly reversible by antibiotic treatment but are associated with adverse prognosis. Bioelectrical impedance deserves further study as a tool for bedside monitoring of patients with bacteremia."

CD009647,0,11011960,0,Epidermal growth factor in urine from patients with bladder cancer.,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a mitogenic polypeptide with a molecular weight of 6000, is excreted in human urine in nanomolar quantities. Recently, some reports showed that urothelial neoplasm was related to the concentration of EGF in urine. In this study, EGF concentration in urine was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 207 samples from 112 male patients (30-90 years old, median 66.2) who had previously been treated for bladder cancer. Then, we tried to clarify the significance of urinary EGF as a marker for recurrence of bladder cancer in comparison with urine cytology. The samples were collected on occasional follow up cystoscopy. Urine from nine age-adjusted males without urological disease was also measured to obtain normal control values. In 123 samples from patients without tumors, EGF concentrations in urine decreased with age. In 84 samples obtained from patients with recurrent tumor, EGF concentrations were significantly lower than those in 123 samples from patients without tumors (P < 0.001) Furthermore, EGF concentrations in longitudinal samples collected the same patients during tumor recurrence and at the times when no tumor was detected were measured in 56 patients. EGF concentrations in the samples collected during tumor recurrence was significantly lower than that in specimens collected when there was no tumor (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences between the same samples collected during tumor recurrence with regard to tumor grade, stage shape and number of tumors. However, EGF concentration in urine from patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) was lower than that in specimens from patients without CIS. These results indicate the usefulness of determining the EGF concentration as a marker for detecting bladder cancer recurrence. Urine cytology was also examined in the same series and findings were compared with those of urinary EGF. On cytology, class IV and V were considered positive, and on urinary EGF, less than 10 ng/mgCr were considered positive. Sensitivity was 25% for cytology and 57% for urinary EGF, while specificity was 98% and 66%, respectively. The predictive positive value was 0.88 and 0.53, respectively. With the combined use of urinary EGF and cytology, the sensitivity, specificity and predictive positive value were 68%, 64% and 0.92, respectively. In conclusion, urinary EGF seems to be a useful marker for detecting bladder cancer recurrence if performed in addition to cytology. cancer recurrence if performed in addition to cytology."
CD009647,0,9750752,0,"[Left ventricular diastolic function: physiology, physiopathology, evaluation, therapy, consequences of anesthesia].","With the exception of cardiac surgery, the acute disturbance of the left ventricular diastole occurs mainly in the elderly. Today it represents 30 to 40% of congestive cardiac failures, however with a lower mortality than for acute systolic disturbances. Generally indicated are relaxation anomalies, proto-mesodiastolic mechanism and problems with compliance, an indicator of the pressure/volume diastolic relationship. Invasive techniques remain the standard method. Doppler echocardiography is becoming increasingly important for the assessment of diastolic function. In most cardiopathies, relaxation anomalies occur early, whereas compliance disturbances are mainly associated with advanced cardiac diseases. During anaesthesia, adverse events (auricular fibrillation, hypovolaemia) may worsen a fragile situation. Anaesthetic agents, in particular volatile agents, act on the ventricular diastole. Long-term therapy of diastolic anomalies includes agents amending left ventricular hypertrophy. Emergency therapy has not yet been systematised."

Although the beneficial effect of HHD on haemodynamic stability is generally explained by its effect on blood volume, we questioned whether additional factors could play a role. Since HHD is associated with higher initial dialysate sodium concentrations and ultrafiltration (UF) rate, we studied whether the beneficial effect of HHD on haemodynamic stability may be explained by an increased release of the vasoconstrictor arginine vasopressin (AVP)."
CD009647,0,9451312,0,Age-related differences in diagnoses within the elderly population.,"The most common diagnoses of elderly patients in the emergency department (ED) were compared among three age subgroups: 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 and older. The computerized billing records for patient visits to 10 northern New Jersey hospital EDs for the years 1985 to 1991 were retrospectively analyzed. The most frequently occurring ICD-9-CM codes for elderly patients were compared among the three age subgroups. Elderly persons comprised 174, 146 (14% of the total) patient visits. The 176,146 patient visits were assigned 259,440 ICD-9-CM codes. The most common ICD-9-CM codes for medical diagnoses included chest pain, cardiac dysrhythmias, congestive heart failure, syncope, abdominal pain, and dyspnea. Fractures, particularly of the lower limb and upper limb; contusions; open wounds, particularly of the head, neck, and trunk; and falls were among the most common trauma diagnoses. The proportions in the three age subgroups of each diagnosis were statistically significantly different, except for cardiac arrest and contusions of the trunk and of multiple sites. The diagnoses with clinically significant higher relative risks in older age subgroups were atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, syncope, hypovolemia/dehydration, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, dyspnea, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, cerebrovascular accident, septicemia, urinary tract infection, fractures, and open wounds of the head, neck, trunk, particularly the scalp, and falls. Clinically significant lower relative risks were found in older age subgroups for chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, angina, chronic airway obstruction not elsewhere classified, epistaxis, contusions of the upper limb, and open wounds of the finger."

CD009647,0,11114572,0,Validation of a simple method for assessing sodium intake in dialysis patients.,"It has been reported that sodium intake can be estimated in dialysis patients by the increment in the body sodium pool from the end of a dialysis session to the beginning of the following one. To verify the reliability of this method we compared the sodium intake, estimated by the interdialytic changes in plasma sodium concentration (C) and body water volume (V), to sodium removal during three consecutive sessions. For this purpose we investigated 9 nondiabetic patients, 5 females and 4 males, under chronic hemofiltration treatment. Sodium intake was estimated by the formula (C(pre) V(pre)) - (C(post) V(post)) using a flame photometer and electrical bioimpedance to determine the plasma sodium concentration and total body water, respectively. Sodium removal was calculated by the difference between sodium loss into the ultrafiltrate and sodium gain with the reinfusion fluid. The mean values of sodium intake calculated during the three intervals corresponded with the sodium losses measured during the three hemofiltration sessions in each patient (338+/-55 vs. 329+/-67 mEq; r = 0.92, p<0.0001). A direct relationship was also observed between sodium intake and both interdialytic body weight increase (r = 0.89, p< 0.0001) and fluid loss during the sessions (r = 0.88, p<0.0001). This data demonstrates that sodium intake can be properly estimated by the interdialytic changes in body water and plasma sodium concentrations. They also suggest that fluid intake may be influenced by sodium consumption and that sodium intake monitoring could be useful for the control of excessive interdialytic fluid gain."

CD009647,0,9213088,0,Thermoregulation at rest and during exercise in healthy older adults.,"Epidemiological evidence of increased mortality among older men and women resulting from hyper- and hypothermia should not be interpreted as implying that aging per se confers an intolerance to environmental extremes. Relatively few studies have attempted to delineate the effects of chronological age from concomitant factors (such as decreases in VO2max, lowered habitual activity levels, alterations in body composition, etc.) in determining thermoregulatory responses to rest and exercise in hot environments. When the effects of chronic diseases and sedentary life-style are kept to a minimum, heat tolerance appears to be minimally compromised by age. VO2max is more important than age in predicting body temperature during exertion, even though some of the physiological mechanisms associated with heat dissipation (especially control of skin blood flow and distribution of cardiac output) are closely associated with chronological age. Dehydration effects may be magnified in older individuals, and rehydration may be compromised by age-related differences in thirst sensitivity and renal function. The efficacy of various interventions in improving thermoregulatory responses of older individuals (e.g., aerobic training and heat acclimation) has not been studied adequately. Older men and women are capable of acclimating to hot conditions, but the time course of physiological changes underlying acclimation with age may be different. Another intervention that holds promise is hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, which acutely affects temperature regulation and control of body fluids in a positive direction. The chronic effects of hormone replacement therapy on thermoregulation during exercise and environmental stresses are not known. Tolerance to cold exposure under resting conditions may be less dependent on age and aerobic fitness than on body composition. Studies of older and younger subjects exercising in cold environments are lacking altogether, including important studies into the possible preventive effects of regular physical activity on physiological responses to cold stress."

CD009647,0,11142772,0,Microrelief of the skin using a light transmission method.,"The recently developed Skin Visiometer, based on light transmission through blue-coloured silicone replicas, was used to study skin microrelief. Calibrated metal plates displaying lines with depths between 6 and 361 microns, were used to determine the accuracy, sensitivity and reproducibility of the technique as well as the parameters of importance during measurement. The precision of the measurements was particularly good between 10 microns and 361 microns. The sensitivity of the method was between 10 and 20 microns. Replicas of volar forearm skin were taken from four groups (n = 15) of male and female volunteers in the age ranges 20 to 30 years and 55 to 65 years. In addition to the instrumental roughness parameters (Rz, Rt, Rm and Ra), the surface of the furrows, the number of primary and secondary lines and the number of intersections were determined. For both sexes, significantly lower values were observed for Rz, Rm and Rt in the younger age group than in the older age group. In addition, the numbers of primary and secondary lines and the number of intersections were higher, pointing to a more structured microrelief in younger forearm skin. Diurnal rhythm, the relative humidity of the measuring room and the position of the forearm were found to be significant factors, while room temperature and precleansing of the skin with mild products were not. Following the application of a hydrating cream (twice daily for 14 days) to the forearm skin of the older female age group, the Rz, Rt, Rm and Ra decreased, while the other parameters measured, except for the surface taken in by the lines, increased, indicating that the microrelief was modified towards the typical pattern observed in young skin."

Each patient was subjected to two infusions: 1.5% glycine in water on one occasion, and the same solution but with 1% ethanol added on the other. Urine and blood samples were collected at regular intervals for up to 2 h after infusion, and the changes in the distribution of water and electrolytes between fluid compartments were calculated. Transient prickling skin sensations were frequently reported effects of the infusions. Two patients experienced visual disturbances. There were no changes in the blood ammonia and plasma vasopressin levels. During the infusions, the estimated blood volume and the total plasma sodium and potassium content increased. The solutions produced osmotic diuresis with increased urinary excretion of water and electrolytes. After ending the fluid administration, blood volume was rapidly restored. Over the following 120 min the irrigant water was redistributed intracellularly or removed by urinary excretion. The addition of ethanol did not alter the overall effects of glycine solution on the fluid balance."
CD009647,0,6346846,0,Clinical efficacy and safety of indapamide in essential hypertension.,"Indapamide, a new methylindoline diuretic that appears to act on the distal renal tubules, is also reported to reduce vascular smooth muscle vasopressor reactivity and possibly to have a calcium-antagonist effect. Since 1973, sixteen studies by a number of European investigators who treated 301 patients with indapamide have revealed satisfactory control in 53% of patients with mild hypertension (standing diastolic pressures less than 90 mm Hg) and in 43% of patients with moderate hypertension when the drug was used without other agents. Multiple American clinical trials of indapamide in hypertension have been conducted, including double-blind, placebo-controlled protocols and trials comparing indapamide with traditional diuretic agents. A cooperative, double-blind, 40-week study compared antihypertensive response to indapamide, 2.5 mg and 5 mg daily, with response to hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg daily, in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Pretreatment diastolic blood pressures averaged 101 mm Hg. At 40 weeks of treatment, indapamide, 2.5 mg daily, had produced a fall in diastolic pressure of 15 mm Hg; indapamide, 5 mg daily, a reduction of 16 mm Hg; and hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg daily, a fall of 15 mm Hg. Seventy-five percent of patients taking 2.5 mg of indapamide daily and 88% of those taking 5 mg achieved satisfactory blood pressure reduction. Hypokalemia may occur with indapamide but is a minor problem and seldom necessitates potassium supplementation. Serum uric acid increases were observed in only a few subjects, and clinical side effects are infrequent and mild. Indapamide is a useful antihypertensive agent with good patient tolerance in mild or moderate hypertension and may offer advantages over traditional diuretics in view of its possible vasodilator and calcium-antagonist properties, once-a-day dosage, and good therapeutic effect with prolonged usage."
CD009647,0,21444157,0,Urine specific gravity as a predictor of early neurological deterioration in acute ischemic stroke.,"We previously found that a blood urea nitrogen/creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio>15 is an independent predictor of early neurological deterioration after acute ischemic stroke, which suggests that dehydration may be a cause of early deterioration. The aim of this study was to determine whether urine specific gravity, which is another indicator of hydration status and one that is more easily obtained, is also an independent predictor of early deterioration or stroke-in-evolution (SIE). Demographic and clinical data were recorded at admission from patients with acute ischemic stroke who were prospectively enrolled from October 2007 to June 2010. We compared patients with and without stroke-in-evolution (based on an increase of 3 points or more points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale within 3 days). Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were carried out. A total of 317 patients (43 SIE and 274 non-SIE) were enrolled; the first 196 patients comprised the cohort of our previous study. The only two independent predictors of early deterioration or SIE were BUN/Cr>15 and urine specific gravity>1.010. After adjusting for age and gender, patients with a urine specific gravity>1.010 were 2.78 times more likely to develop SIE (95% CI=1.11-6.96; P=0.030). Urine specific gravity may be useful as an early predictor of early deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients with urine specific gravity ≤ 1.010 therefore may have a reduced likelihood of early neurological deterioration."
CD009647,0,1389281,0,Reoperation and the centrifugal pump?,"Postperfusion syndrome is still a problem in long cardiac operations using extracorporeal circulation (ECC). To evaluate whether or not centrifugal blood pumping during open heart surgery is beneficial, a randomized, prospective study was undertaken of 50 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting. The patients were divided into two groups of 25 each. In group 1 a centrifugal pump (Biomedicus) was used as arterial blood pump, while in group 2 a roller pump (Stöckert) was used. The two groups did not differ significantly and the number of variables during surgery was kept low (identical perfusion set, two surgeons, minimal cardiotomy suction). The parameters studied included the cellular elements of the blood and components indicating their functional integrity, such as PMN-elastase, plasma hemoglobin, beta-thromboglobulin, and thrombin-antithrombin III complex and D-dimer as representatives for activated coagulation and secondary fibrinolysis. Blood and urine samples were taken every 15 min during ECC, on arrival in the intensive care unit, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h thereafter. No difference between the groups was found in regard to bypass time, ECC flow and volume, fluid balance, and clinical outcome. Significant differences in favor of group 1 were found in plasma hemoglobin (P less than 0.05), beta-thromboglobulin (P less than 0.01), D-dimer (P less than 0.05), and platelet counts (P less than 0.5). These differences were clearly ECC-time-dependent and became statistically significant after 90 min bypass. We conclude that roller pumps still can be safely used for standard cardiac procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,15648026,0,Assessment of body composition in long-term hemodialysis patients: rationale and methodology.,"Protein-energy malnutrition is seen in patients with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is even more pronounced in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis treatment. Both entities have great impact on patient morbidity and mortality. Analysis of body composition is an integral part of nutritional assessment and includes the estimation of muscle, fat, and fat-free mass, as well as the extracellular water compartment. Clinical assessment of these compartments is difficult, and gold-standard methods such as tracer dilution, magnetic resonance imaging, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry are expensive, cumbersome, and rarely available. We report an ongoing study of body composition in hemodialysis patients involving deuterium and sodium bromide dilution, total body potassium counting, magnetic resonance imaging, whole-body and segmental bioimpedance spectroscopy, and anthropometry. The goals of the study are (1) to validate bioimpedance technology against gold-standard methods for assessment of the various body compartments, (2) to directly quantify visceral adipose tissue mass, a potential source of cytokine production (adipokines) promoting chronic inflammation, and to study its relation to inflammatory markers, and (3) to directly quantify visceral organ mass and to study its relation to uremia toxin generation as assessed by protein catabolic rate and resting energy expenditure. Preliminary results based on up to 40 hemodialysis patients are reported."
CD009647,0,6346848,0,Long-term experience with indapamide.,"Indapamide, 2.5 mg administered once daily for periods up to 36 months, was found to be safe and effective for the long-term control of mild to moderate hypertension. The effects of hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg, and indapamide, 2.5 mg, were studied in two randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials. Data from the two multicenter trials (20 study sites) were pooled for purposes of comparison. Significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with patients in both supine and standing positions, occurred in both groups within the first 8 weeks of treatment. This effect was maintained throughout the active treatment period. Success, as determined by the therapeutic success rate (percentage of patients with decreases of standing phase V diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mm Hg or to below 90 mm Hg), occurred in 53% of the patients given hydrochlorothiazide and in 56% of the indapamide-treated patients. During the study period, the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse reactions were similar for both groups. There was no clinically significant difference between the treatment groups for the laboratory assessments. Patients who completed the multicenter trials were eligible for participation in an ongoing long-term extension study of the safety of indapamide. Data are available for periods up to 36 months and demonstrate neither augmentation of clinical or laboratory adverse effects nor any potentially harmful indicators that could be attributed to prolonged treatment."
CD009647,0,15648025,0,Prospective nutritional surveillance using bioelectrical impedance in chronic kidney disease patients.,"Malnutrition is a well-known risk factor influencing survival in chronic maintenance dialysis patients. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are also predisposed to malnutrition because of dietary restrictions and the catabolic effects of uremia. Therefore, a significant degree of malnutrition may be present before the initiation of renal replacement therapy. We consequently initiated a prospective evaluation of subjects attending the CKD clinic, where all patients are seen by a renal dietitian and nutritional, biochemical, and bioimpedance parameters are measured every 3 months. A total of 40 patients have completed 9 months of follow-up and are the subject of this report. Their mean age is 65 +/- 12 years, 48% female, 68% black, and 58% diabetic patients. The glomerular filtration rate did not change during follow-up (36 +/- 12 versus 34 +/- 14 mL/min/1.72 m 2 , at baseline and 9 months, respectively). Similarly, no differences between baseline and 9 months were noted in weight (88.0 +/- 20.3 versus 86.8 +/- 18.7 kg, respectively) or body mass index (30.6 +/- 5.8 versus 30.2 +/- 5.4 kg/m 2 , respectively). In addition, no differences between baseline and 9 months were noted in total body water (44.4 +/- 11.4 versus 44.6 +/- 10.8 L, respectively), body cell mass (25.3 +/- 7.4 versus 25.2 +/- 7.0 kg, respectively), and fat-free mass (59.2 +/- 16.6 versus 59.4 +/- 15.7 kg, respectively). The bioimpedance vector decreased with time in 25 subjects (62%), indicating a state of overhydration. Subjects were further analyzed by vector category. Body cell mass did not change in either group. As expected, total body water increased in the group with a decreasing bioimpedance vector. Because body cell mass did not increase, the greater total body water reflected an increase in extracellular volume (edema). In the group with stable vectors, no changes were noted with time in weight or total body water. These results indicate that CKD patients with stable renal function following a judicious dietary protein intake (0.6 to 0.8 g/kg normalized body weight/day) have no loss of body cell mass or fat-free mass over a 9-month period. Of note, a high proportion of patients (62%) developed clinically unrecognized fluid retention, which is promptly identified by a decreasing bioimpedance vector."

All three patients had a high risk of renal failure because of persistently high levels of proteinuria. We performed low-density lipoprotein apheresis (LDL-A) and achieved complete remission in two cases. The third patients developed NS relapse and a deteriorating renal function; however, withdrawal from dialysis therapy was achieved. There are no proven therapies for treating patients with PSL- and CyA-resistant IMN with acute deteriorating renal function or difficulties in maintaining fluid balance. We evaluated the treatment course and physiological mechanisms and reviewed similar cases in the pertinent literature."

CD009647,0,8667198,0,Mechanisms by which octreotide ameliorates symptoms in the dumping syndrome.,"Octreotide reduces abdominal and vasomotor symptoms in dumping syndrome by unknown mechanisms. Effects of octreotide (50 microgram) on symptoms, hemodynamic parameters and plasma glucose and insulin levels after glucose meals were tested in double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion in eight patients with dumping syndrome. Gastric scintigraphy tested whether octreotide reduces symptoms by slowing gastric emptying. Octreotide reduced diarrhea, lightheadedness and palpitations after 75 g of glucose, compared with placebo (P < .001). Orthostatic pulse increases after glucose decreased from 36 +/- 6 beats/min after placebo to 9 +/- 5 beats/min after octreotide (P < .05), and standing blood pressure decreases after glucose were abolished (P < .05), but octreotide had no effect on increase in hematocrit or plasma osmolarity after glucose. Late hypoglycemia was prevented by octreotide, and peak fed insulin levels were reduced from 87 +/- 15 to 26 +/- 9 microU/ml after octreotide (P < .05). Times to maximal plasma glucose levels after meals were prolonged from 28 +/- 4 to 78 +/- 6 min after octreotide (P < .05). Octreotide had no effect on gastric emptying of liquids or solids. In conclusion, amelioration of dumping symptoms by octreotide is associated with reduced orthostasis, which is not a consequence of prevention of hemoconcentration. Prevention of late hypoglycemia may be due to blunted insulin release. Octreotide does not reverse rapid gastric emptying, indicating a limited role for this purported mechanism of action."
CD009647,0,17285441,0,Impact of volume status on the incidence of atrial fibrillation following aortic arch repair.,"We evaluated the volume status of patients undergoing aortic arch repair to determine the impact of fluid balance on risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF). From 1993, 445 patients who underwent total aortic arch repair were enrolled in this study. Patients who had AF preoperatively or died within the 10th postoperative day (POD) were excluded. Volumes administered (input) and eliminated (output) through all routes were recorded, and fluid balance (input minus output) was calculated intraoperatively, on the day of surgery, and PODs 1-2. The incidence of new onset of AF was 53.9% (240/445). Total input on POD 1 was greater in patients developing AF than in those not developing it (3,372 +/- 90 vs 3,012 +/- 79; P = 0.0036), as was net fluid balance on POD 1 as well (-806 +/- 84 vs -558 +/- 90; P = 0.050). Blood transfusion volume was greater in patients developing AF than in those not developing it on POD 1 (1,285 +/- 89 vs 927 +/- 74; P = 0.003) and POD 2 (405 +/- 53 vs 227 +/- 47; P = 0.015). Increased input volume and net fluid balance on POD 1 are associated with an increased risk of postoperative AF in patients undergoing aortic arch surgery."

The PDA was successfully closed using a Nit-Occlud device designed for PDA closure. The day before the programmed procedure, the patient was admitted for signs and symptoms of cardiac heart failure and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The procedure was postponed for 6 days, and in the meantime, she was successfully treated with diuretics, negative water balance and heart rate control.

Renal system changes which occur with aging cause alterations in the functional balance of fluid and electrolytes, and sodium regulation is not as effective. In one form of hyponatremia seen among the elderly, total body sodium content is normal, but water is retained because of increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. This condition, called the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), has many causes including chronic illnesses and various medications. The physiology behind SIADH, its causes, diagnostics, and various treatment modalities are explored."
CD009647,0,17401728,0,"What causes the hippocampal volume decrease in depression? Are neurogenesis, glial changes and apoptosis implicated?","Even though in vivo imaging studies document significant reductions of hippocampal volume in depressed patients, the exact underlying cellular mechanisms are unclear. Since stressful life events are associated with an increased risk of developing depression, preclinical studies in which animals are exposed to chronic stress have been used to understand the hippocampal shrinkage in depressed patients. Based on morphometrical studies in these models, parameters like dendritic retraction, suppressed adult neurogenesis and neuronal death, all due to elevated levels of glucocorticoids, have been suggested as major causative factors in hippocampal shrinkage. However, histopathological studies examining hippocampi of depressed individuals have so far failed to confirm either a massive neuronal loss or a suppression of dentate neurogenesis, an event that is notably very rare in adult or elderly humans. In fact, many of the structural changes and the volume reduction appear to be reversible. Clearly, more histopathological studies are needed; especially ones that (a) employ stereological quantification, (b) focus on specific cellular elements and populations, and (c) are performed in nonmedicated depressed patients. We conclude that mainly other factors, like alterations in the somatodendritic, axonal, and synaptic components and putative glial changes are most likely to explain the hippocampal shrinkage in depression, while shifts in fluid balance or changes in the extracellular space cannot be excluded either."
CD009647,0,3966167,0,Classical heatstroke: clinical and laboratory assessment.,"We reviewed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 34 patients who had classical heatstroke during the Kansas City heat wave of 1980. The patients were elderly, predominantly black, and of low socioeconomic class. Overall mortality was 18%, with 9% of patients exhibiting severe residual neurologic deficit; 73% had full recovery. Patients with coma, temperature greater than or equal to 108 F (42.2 C), severe hypotension, coagulopathy, and need for respiratory assistance were at highest risk of death. Associated disease was common (67%), with hypertension (32%), diabetes (21%), and alcoholism (21%) being most frequent. Medications known to predispose to heatstroke were used by 56% of patients. Hematologic abnormalities were nonspecific, and clinical evidence of renal or hepatic failure was rare. Hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated levels of creatine phosphokinase and glucose were frequent but did not correlate with outcome. The predominant arterial blood gas abnormality was metabolic acidosis or a combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis."
CD009647,0,8429402,0,Bioelectric and anthropometric assessments and reference data in the elderly.,"Most studies using bioelectric impedance have estimated the volume of total body water, fat-free mass and on occasion extracellular fluid volume using whole-body resistance and reactance. However, the validity of bioelectric impedance has not been established for the elderly except in small samples of limited age ranges. The estimation of whole-body composition from impedance of body segments may be an alternative method that can be applied to many chair- and bedfast elderly patients. Also, measures of bioelectric impedance at lower and higher frequencies than 50 kHz are reported to differentiate the proportions of intra- and extracellular fluid volumes, and this could also provide important information about fluid quantities and balances in the elderly. Distribution statistics for body measurements for persons 65-85 y of age are available from the national health surveys and large clinical studies but reference data for persons > or = 80 y are sparse. Some reference data may be from groups that are not representative of the elderly because the samples were from cohorts older than elderly persons living today and significant group and racial differences existed among these as children and adults. These differences may have increased interindividual variances among the elderly. Suitable reference data for the present generations of elderly in the United States will be available with the culmination of NHANES III after 1994, but limited reference data for elderly persons up to 90 y of age have been published.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,6355240,0,Impaired response of plasma vasopressin to orthostatic stress in patients with congestive heart failure.,"Arginine vasopressin, a potent vasoconstrictor and regulator of body water, is frequently increased in the plasma of patients with congestive heart failure. Other neurohumoral control networks, such as the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, also demonstrate increased activity in congestive heart failure, but fail to respond normally to physiologic stress, such as orthostatic tilt. To assess the response of plasma vasopressin to orthostasis in heart failure, vasopressin was measured before and at 10 and 45 minutes during passive upright tilt in 15 patients with congestive heart failure and their response was compared with that in 9 normal control subjects. Arginine vasopressin was measured by radioimmunoassay. In the normal subjects, plasma arginine vasopressin was 5.3 +/- 2.3 pg/ml at control, was unchanged at 10 minutes, but significantly increased to 7.0 +/- 2.5 pg/ml at 45 minutes (p less than 0.05). In contrast, patients with congestive heart failure showed no significant changes in arginine vasopressin levels from the control levels of 11.6 +/- 5.5 pg/ml. Both plasma norepinephrine and renin activity increased in the normal subjects, but failed to increase from higher baselines in patients with congestive heart failure. Thus, plasma arginine vasopressin, like plasma norepinephrine and renin activity, does not increase in response to upright tilt in patients with congestive heart failure. The explanation is not evident but could involve either abnormalities in reflex control of plasma vasopressin in congestive heart failure or in clearance of the hormone during orthostasis."
CD009647,0,2504940,0,Purple urine bags.,Purple urine drainage bags were found in 7 of 71 chronically catheterized elderly women. The purple staining of the bags is due to a violet discoloration (indirubin) of the plastic of the catheter bag and fine blue crystals of indigo in the urine. The colors are formed from the substrate indoxyl sulfate (indican) and all 7 patients had bacteria in the urine that would produce blue colonies on agar enriched with the urine (filter sterilized) of the patients involved. Organisms identified were Providencia or Klebsiella species. Indican excretion was higher in patients with purple urinary catheter bags than in controls.
CD009647,0,1736693,0,Neuropathologic findings after long-term intrathecal infusion of morphine and bupivacaine for pain treatment in cancer patients.,"Epidural or intrathecal infusions of morphine and bupivacaine mixtures are presently used for the treatment of ""refractory"" cancer pain even though the neurotoxic potential of such mixtures is unknown. The pathologic findings of the spinal column, the meninges, the nerve roots, and the spinal cord, and the clinical neurologic deficits were recorded in 15 patients (5 men and 10 women), aged 26-83 (median 68) yr, treated for 4-274 (median 81) days with intrathecal infusions of morphine (with preservatives [sodium metabisulfite and sodium edetate]) and bupivacaine mixtures, given through open, subcutaneously tunneled nylon catheters. Six patients had been subjected to radiation therapy (20-96 Gy), applied over the spinal column, and four had been treated with antineoplastics believed to be neurotoxic. Ten patients had various neurologic deficits before the intrathecal treatment. The cumulative doses (ranges) given intrathecally were: morphine 33-11,900 mg, sodium metabisulfite 3.3-1,050 mg, sodium edetate 0.33-105 mg, and bupivacaine 10-41,400 mg; cumulative volumes were 16-9,400 ml. The concentrations of the drugs in the mixtures were: morphine 0.25-4.0 mg/ml, sodium metabisulfite 0.025-0.40 mg/ml, sodium edetate 0.0025-0.04 mg/ml, and bupivacaine 3.0-4.75 mg/ml. The osmolality of the mixtures in vitro ranged from 282 to 286 mOsm/kg and the pH from 4.1 to 4.6. The pathologic findings consisted of vertebral metastases (n = 6), epidural and/or intrathecal tumor masses (n = 8), focal subdural fibrosis (n = 6), infiltration of mononuclear cells in the subarachnoid space (n = 10), and discrete injuries (nerve fiber degeneration or fibrosis) to the anterior (five patients) and posterior (seven) nerve roots, and spinal cord (tumor compression [one], slight thickening of the leptomeninges [one], and thrombosis of a spinal artery and medullary infarction [one]). In none of the cases was any reaction against the nylon catheter within its subarachnoid course recorded. The neuropathologic findings were not related to the duration or cumulative doses of the intrathecal treatment. No new neurologic deficits that could be attributed to the intrathecal administration of the opiate-bupivacaine mixtures were recorded. The neuropathologic and clinical neurologic findings in cancer patients treated with intrathecal morphine-bupivacaine mixtures appeared similar to those in animals and humans reported with either intrathecal morphine or bupivacaine alone."
CD009647,0,7674884,0,Practical techniques for assessing body composition in middle-aged and older adults.,"The purpose of this study was to compare the relationships of anthropometric, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and near infrared interactance (NIR) measurements with a multiple-component (MC) criterion estimate of body composition derived from body density (D), body water (W), and bone mineral (B) in 48 white adults aged 49-80 yr. Relative errors of predicting the MC criterion from the practical measurements were determined by simple regressions within gender and calculated as the SEE divided by the criterion mean and expressed as a percentage. Relative errors were lowest for the BIA variable, height2/resistance (4.8-5.0%), higher for body mass index and the sum of 10 skinfold thicknesses (7.0-14.5%), and highest for NIR-derived optical density readings at the biceps and the sum of 10 sites (10.8-15.8%). Due to the low relative prediction error for height2/resistance, sex-specific BIA formulas for estimating fat-free mass from D, W, and B (FFM-DWB) were developed. The SEEs for predicting FFM-DWB from BIA, weight, and age were both 1.5 kg in women and men. Because BIA is not limited to ambulatory subjects, it is concluded that BIA may be a particularly useful, practical technique for estimating body composition in older adults."
CD009647,0,6824005,0,Vasopressin response to orthostatic hypotension. Etiologic and clinical implications.,"Plasma vasopressin was measured before and after tilt testing in 18 patients with orthostatic hypotension of various causes. In six patients, all of whom had normal osmotic regulation of vasopressin, normal stimulation of vasopressin did not occur on tilt testing; all six had clinical evidence of defects in the afferent or central connections of the baroregulatory reflex arc. In the remaining 12 patients, plasma vasopressin increased to levels appropriate for the degree of hypotension; none of these patients had clinical evidence of defects in afferent or central portions of the baroregulatory arc. Those with subnormal vasopressin response had significantly more severe orthostatic hypotension than the patients with normal vasopressin response, but none had plasma hypotonicity, an abnormality present in one-quarter of those with normal response. It is concluded that the vasopressin response to orthostatic hypotension may serve as a test of the integrity of the afferent and central components of the baroregulatory reflex arc. Furthermore, this study suggests that the normal vasopressin response to orthostatic hypotension may moderate the fall in blood pressure but may adversely affect water balance."

CD009647,0,12670061,0,Agitation and aggressiveness among the elderly population living in nursing or retirement homes in France.,"The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological features of agitation and aggressiveness in elderly individuals living in French nursing and retirement homes in the year 2000. Data were collected on the type, time of onset, and duration of symptoms, medical evaluation and treatment, and medical and psychiatric comorbidities of the elderly patients. The most frequently reported behavior was verbal aggressiveness and the least reported behavior was physical aggressiveness. A triggering factor initiating the symptoms of agitation or aggressiveness was reported in 61% of the cases. In 61% of the study population, there were several morbidities reported as caused by the agitated or aggressive behavior (anorexia, weight loss, dehydration). A specialist was consulted for nearly half of the agitated or aggressive patients. For 55% of the patients, a new medication regimen was started or the administration of previous medications was modified, the most frequently prescribed drugs being antipsychotics. The results of our study and others show that agitation and aggression have a substantial impact on the lives of the elderly population, as well as on the lives of their family members and caretakers."
CD009647,0,2176591,1,Estimation of body composition by bioelectrical impedance in cancer patients.,"Measurement of body composition is important in the assessment of nutritional status in cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to validate the bioelectrical impedance (BI) method for body composition estimation in 33 elderly cancer patients (mean age 66 +/- 9 years) using the deuterium dilution technique (2H2O) as the reference method. Height2/Resistance (H2/R) correlated significantly with total body water (TBW) computed from 2H2O (r = 0.89, P less than 0.001; s.e.e. = 2.4 l). The prediction equation for TBW improved significantly (P less than 0.001) by addition of H2/R to the predictor variables weight, height, age and sex.

CD009647,0,2314616,0,[Intestinal ischemia: nosographic framework and risk factors].,"The diagnosis of intestinal ischaemia still presents numerous problems in terms of nosography, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment with the result that it is more often excluded than diagnosed. The aim of the present study was to discover whether intestinal ischaemia was clinically identifiable by any specific early signs and symptoms and whether there were any concomitant risk factors. The medical reports on 44 patients consecutively admitted to the San Giovanni Battista Hospital, Turin in 1985-86 with suspected intestinal ischaemia were therefore examined. It was found that intestinal ischaemia was only occasionally (30% of cases) diagnosed at the onset of clinical symptoms. In the 10 patients with ischaemic colitis, the risk factor linked to the causes of the disease was systemic hypovolaemia arising in diffuse atherosclerosis. In the 8 cases of chronic ischaemia and the 26 of intestinal infarction the remote anamnesis revealed symptoms that should have aroused suspicion of intestinal ischaemia partly because the patients were suffering from widespread atherosclerosis. In fact a review of the risk factors for the onset of atherosclerosis (i.e. high blood pressure, smoking, dyslipidemia, obesity and age over 65) revealed that about 60% of the patients under study presented 3 or 4 them simultaneously. To conclude, the data emerging from the study indicate the existence of symptoms and risk factors to diffuse atherosclerosis that should permit the early diagnosis of intestinal ischaemia."

We investigated whether BIA can replace VCD. VCD did not correlate with TBW but correlated moderately with ECW/TBW (r = 0.42; 0.025 < p < 0.05) and ICW/ECW (r = -0.47; p < 0.025). Patients with underhydration (n = 4; VCD <8 mm/m2) revealed limits for BIA variables as ICW/ECW (>1.50) and ECW/TBW (<0.40). The same held true for overhydration (n = 5; VCD >11.5 mm/m2): ICW/ECW (<1.50) and ECW/TBW (>0.40). Although the positive predictive value of ICW/ECW and ECW/TBW for both under- and overhydration was only 50% and 54%, respectively, there were no false negative values. Although BIA cannot replace VCD in PD patients, the reverse holds true as well. Combining BIA and VCD may lead to a better estimation of hydration status because both techniques provide complementary information."
CD009647,0,9754456,0,Clinical use of profiled hemodialysis.,"The new population on dialysis today consists mainly of high risk patients (the elderly, diabetics, etc.) with high cardiovascular scores, and such vascular pathology is the most important predisposing factor for the occurrence of a frequent intradialytic clinical complication, vascular instability syndrome, which covers a range of clinical problems. Recently a new dialysis technique, profiled hemodialysis (PHD), has been set up and proposed for routine use. PHD consists of the clinical use of preestablished individual dialysis profiles aimed at antagonizing the changes in intradialytic plasma osmolarity by continuous modulation of dialysate sodium concentration throughout the whole extracorporeal session. In particular, PHD aims at reducing the fall of plasma osmolarity in the first half of the session (when it is higher) by reducing the sodium removal rate through increasing its dialysate concentration while taking into account the desired individual sodium balance to be reached at the end of the session. In this work, we report clinical experience with PHD compared to standard hemodialysis with constant sodium dialysate (SHD) in terms of its efficacy to maintain a more stable intradialytic blood volume (BV) and more stable hemodynamics. The PHD used in this work has been implemented by a mathematical model for computing the individual dialysate sodium profile which we have recently validated (Ursino M, Coli L, La Manna G, Grilli Cicilioni M, Dalmastri V, Guidicissi A, Masotti P, Avanzolini G, Stefani S, Bonomini V. A simple mathematical model of intradialytic sodium kinetics: ""in vivo"" validation during hemodialysis with constant or variable sodium. Int J Artif Organs 1996;19:393-403.). Eleven uremic patients affected by hypotension at the beginning of dialysis treatment were studied. Each patient first underwent an SHD treatment and 1 week later a PHD treatment. The 2 extracorporeal sessions (one on SHD and the other on PHD) were performed in each individual patient under identical operative conditions including the sodium mass removal by the end of the session and the ultrafiltration rate. The crit line and Doppler echocardiography were used to determine BV, cardiac output (CO), and stroke volume (SV) throughout the sessions. The mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) were simultaneously monitored. PHD was associated with a more stable intradialytic BV and more stable hemodynamics compared to SHD. The higher stability of BV and cardiac function (in terms of SV and CO maintenance) which was obtained above all in the first half of the PHD session was associated with a higher stability of the MBP and the HR. This resulted in an enhancement in cardiovascular tolerance to ultrafiltration throughout the session in all tested patients. In contrast, SHD in the same patients was characterized by early significant changes in BV and cardiovascular parameters resulting in a significant decrease of the MBP and a significant increase of the HR throughout the session and also 1 h after the end of dialysis. Our results indicate that PHD may represent an efficient approach for the treatment of patients suffering from intradialytic vascular instability. If long-term clinical practice confirms the efficacy of PHD in controlling dialysis intolerance symptoms, it will have great scope as a routine procedure."

Kidney protection was accomplished by pre-treating the patient with mannitol and low molecular weight dextran solution and flushing the kidney with a Xylocaine-heparin mixture and cold Sacks' II solution. The mean cold ischaemia time was 239 min (range 140-345 min). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remained unchanged post-operatively in terms of both total and split kidney GFR. Proximal and distal tubular integrity, as studied by determination of beta2-microglobulin excretion and concentration ability respectively, was also preserved."
CD009647,0,22576260,0,Effect of thirst challenge on ADH levels in patients with bilateral Menière's disease.,"The aim of the study was to investigate plasma ADH levels and plasma/urine osmolality in patients suffering from bilateral Menière's disease since a disturbance in the water household after thirst challenge is a suspected pathogenic factor in the development of this disease. In this study the plasma ADH levels and plasma/urine osmolality of bilateral Menière's disease patients under thirst challenge were investigated to show whether the water balance is affected. 9 patients with bilateral Menière's disease and 9 healthy controls skipped water intake for 12 h. Plasma ADH, plasma/urine osmolality, and electrolytes were measured after this thirst period as well as 8 h later after food and fluid intake. During food and fluid intake the patients demonstrated a slightly higher plasma ADH level and plasma osmolality than controls, whereas at the end of the thirst period patients and the controls showed no significant change. Instead the urine osmolality differed significantly (p<0.001): showing a high urine osmolality in controls and an almost stable urine osmolality in patients after thirst challenge. This indicates that the water balance in patients is likely different from that of controls. These observations point to ADH and its target aquaporine 2 as keyplayers in the pathophysiological events leading to the development of Menière's disease."
CD009647,0,7922049,0,"Relationship between weight loss, reduction of body cell mass and inflammatory response in patients with cancer.","Reduced food intake is a major cause of continuing weight loss in patients with cancer. Previous work has suggested that an ongoing inflammatory response may also contribute to weight loss and alter the nature of body tissue loss. To examine this, body cell mass was estimated using measurements of total body potassium (TBK) in 31 patients with gastrointestinal cancer and weight loss with or without an inflammatory response (C-reactive protein level above 5 mg/l). Albumin levels, total body water and 24-h urinary creatinine clearance were also measured. When measured TBK was expressed as a percentage of predicted normal values there was a significant reduction in TBK for patients with an inflammatory response compared with that of those without (P = 0.04). However, when a different prediction equation for TBK was used this difference was not significant (P = 0.29). Therefore, it remains uncertain whether an ongoing inflammatory response in patients with cancer and weight loss contributes to loss of body cell mass."

We observed 13 episodes of severe hyponatremia (less than 120 mmol/l) following a period of increased water consumption in 10 psychiatric patients (5 men, 5 women, mean age 48.8 years) treated with neuroleptics and/or benzodiazepines. Other causes of hyponatremia were excluded. The initial clinical signs were associated with severe gastrointestinal and neurological disorders requiring intensive care. In every case a gradual return to normal of natremia was obtained by creating a negative water balance while compensating for the sodium loss. From a study of urine and plasma osmolality ratio (U/P osm) on admission, several physiopathological mechanisms could be envisaged. A U/P osm ratio lower than 1 (6 cases) suggested a water intake exceeding the maximum dilution capacity of the kidneys (20-25 1), or a lesser water intake with little or no osmolal intake, or again an intrarenal disorder of urine dilution. When the U/P osm ratio was higher than 1 (7 cases), reflecting inappropriate secretion of the antidiuretic hormone, the hyponatremia could be explained by the psychosis itself, the treatment taken by the patients, a disorder of thirst regulation and/or a non-osmotic stimulation of vasopressin. This population, therefore, was heterogeneous: the mechanisms which contribute to this pathology are not fully elucidated, and they probably involve several factors."

CD009647,0,666184,0,Urinary diagnostic indices in acute renal failure: a prospective study.,"A prospective analysis of the value of urinary diagnostic indices in ascertaining the cause of acute renal failure was undertaken. Our results show that in the setting of acute oliguria a diagnosis of potentially reversible prerenal azotemia is likely with urine osmolality greater than 500 mosm/kg H2O, urine sodium concentration less than 20 meq/litre, urine/plasma urea nitrogen ratio greater than 8, and urine/plasma creatinine ratio greater than 40. Conversely, a urine osmolality less than 350 mosm/kg, urine sodium concentration greater than 40 meq/liter, urine/plasma urea nitrogen ratio less than 3, and urine/plasma creatinine ratio less than 20 suggest acute tubular necrosis. A significant number of oliguric patients will not have urinary indices that fall within these guidelines. In this setting, urine sodium concentration divided by the urine-to-plasma creatinine ratio (the renal failure index) and the fractional excretion of filtered sodium provide a reliable means of differentiating reversible prerenal azotemia from acute tubular necrosis."
CD009647,0,3713747,0,Osmotic demyelination syndrome following correction of hyponatremia.,"The treatment of hyponatremia is controversial: some authorities have cautioned that rapid correction causes central pontine myelinolysis, and others warn that severe hyponatremia has a high mortality rate unless it is corrected rapidly. Eight patients treated over a five-year period at our two institutions had a neurologic syndrome with clinical or pathological findings typical of central pontine myelinolysis, which developed after the patients presented with severe hyponatremia. Each patient's condition worsened after relatively rapid correction of hyponatremia (greater than 12 mmol of sodium per liter per day)--a phenomenon that we have called the osmotic demyelination syndrome. Five of the patients were treated at one hospital, and accounted for all the neurologic complications recorded among 60 patients with serum sodium concentrations below 116 mmol per liter; no patient in whom the sodium level was raised by less than 12 mmol per liter per day had any neurologic sequelae. Reviewing published reports on patients with very severe hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 106 mmol per liter) revealed that neurologic sequelae were associated with correction of hyponatremia by more than 12 mmol per liter per day; when correction proceeded more slowly, patients had uneventful recoveries. We suggest that the osmotic demyelination syndrome is a preventable complication of overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia."

In order to test the practicability of routine postdialysis cGMP determination for the detection of fluid overload, ANP and cGMP levels in the total hemodialysis population of 81 patients were measured with blood samples drawn immediately after hemodialysis. Twenty-three patients had a cGMP level of more than 20 pmol/mL. In 13 of these, pulmonary congestion was present on the chest roentgenogram. Two of these patients refused a gradual reduction of their dry body weight. In the remaining 21 patients, the weight reduction was associated with a decrease in cGMP levels in all cases and with a decrease in ANP levels in all but two cases. Fourteen of the 21 patients reached a cGMP level below 20 pmol/mL after weight reduction, and at that time, none of these showed signs of pulmonary congestion on chest x-ray. All seven patients, whose cGMP levels remained above 20 pmol/mL despite the reduction, had documented heart disease with impairment of left ventricular function. These results suggest that the plasma cGMP level after hemodialysis is more apt for the determination of dry body weight than is ANP or a chest roentgenogram."

In this paper the responses of plasma norepinephrine (PNE), plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (PAC) to upright standing were studied in 17 diabetic patients without OH, 25 diabetics with OH and 17 age-matched, non-diabetic normotensives (controls). All were kept on a 200mEq sodium diet. Assay procedure for PNE was high-performance liquid chromatography with trihydroxyindol method and fluorimetric detection using dihydroxybenzylamine as internal standard. Intra- and inter-assay coefficient variations by this method were 3.4 and 5.8% respectively. PRA and PAC were determined by radioimmunoassay. Total blood volume was examined by the plasma tracer method using 131I-HSA and expressed in percent normal. Mean PNE level in the non-diabetic controls was 217 pg/ml in recumbency and increased to a level of 551 at 15 minutes on standing. The PNE responses to standing in the diabetic subjects without OH (defined as group I) were not significantly different from those in the controls. In the diabetics with OH, 14 cases, with the PNE increments less than 1SD below the mean in the controls, were defined as group III, and discriminated from other 11 subjects with OH (group II). PNE levels in group III were significantly lower than in the controls at both recumbency and upright posture. PRA was significantly elevated by standing in the controls and the diabetics except for group II. PRA in all the diabetic groups was significantly lower than in the controls, at both recumbent and upright. The mean values of PAC in the diabetics but group II at supine were significantly lower than those of the control group. PAC levels increased after standing contemporaneously with PRA, though significant rise in group II was shown without PRA response. Total blood volume was significantly (p less than 0.025) decreased in only group II. The results suggest: 1) PNE was normal in the diabetic patients without OH, 2) there are at least two types of OH in diabetes mellitus: one is hypoadrenergic and the other hypovolemic, 3) adrenergic neuropathy may be a cause of low PRA in diabetics with OH but another factor may also be involved in both with and without OH, 4) low PRA is a main factor of low PAC in diabetics (group I and III), but the dissociation between PRA and PAC responses to orthostasis is present in some cases (group II), which reflects disturbances in other regulatory mechanisms of aldosterone secretion."
CD009647,0,17296872,0,Polymorphism of CYP11B2 determines salt sensitivity in Japanese.,"Aldosterone plays essential roles in body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure. However, the association between polymorphisms in the CYP11B2 gene and hypertension is controversial. We resequenced CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 and identified 35 polymorphisms in this region. We performed association studies between the plasma aldosterone concentration and 13 polymorphisms in this region in 1443 subjects. The subjects were all obtained from the Suita Cohort Study. Multiple regression analysis indicated that aldosterone levels were determined by renin activity, age, total cholesterol, and hematocrit. Residuals of the aldosterone levels after adjusting for these confounding factors were nominally associated with the T(-344)C (P=0.0026), C(595)T (P=0.0180), -(4837)C (P=0.0310), and G(4936)A (P=0.0498) polymorphisms. Only the T(-344)C polymorphism was significantly associated with the aldosterone level after a correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni). A significant interaction was observed between the T(-344)C polymorphism and renin activity in determining aldosterone levels. Moreover, a significant interaction was observed in 2063 subjects between urinary sodium excretion, which reflects sodium intake, and the T(-344)C polymorphism in determining systolic blood pressure. Only subjects with the TT genotype showed a positive correlation between urinary sodium excretion and systolic blood pressure. In vitro experiments confirmed the functional significance of this T(-344)C polymorphism in terms of angiotensin II reactivity. Thus, the T(-344)C polymorphism in CYP11B2 appears to affect salt sensitivity in Japanese and to have clinical significance."
CD009647,0,10835833,0,Comparison between the air displacement method and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry for estimation of body fat.,"Air displacement plethysmography (ADP) is a method for the determining percent body fat (%BF) using the two-compartment model, in which the body is partitioned into body-fat mass and fat-free mass (FFM). Although this model assumes a constant density of FFM as 1.10 g/ml, its density may depend upon the bone mineral content (BMC) and total body water (TBW) which vary with age, gender, and race/ethnicity. This study compared %BF determined from ADP (ADP%BF) with %BF obtained by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA%BF), and also investigated the effects of BMC, TBW, and other factors on its value. The subjects were 721 female and male Japanese aged 40 to 79 years. Body density was measured by ADP and %BF was calculated using Brozek et al's equation. BMC and body-fat volume were measured using DXA, and TBW was measured by multifrequency bioelectrical impedance. A series of anthropometric measurements was taken. Although ADP%BF was highly correlated with DXA%BF (female: r = 0.89, male: r = 0.90) (p < 0.001), ADP%BF differed significantly from DXA%BF (female: -1.30 +/- 0.14% (mean +/- s.e.m.), male: 1.22 +/- 0.13%) (p < 0.001). The difference in %BF (ADP%BF-DXA%BF) was negatively associated with BMC/FFM but not with TBW/FFM in both genders. The difference in %BF was also positively correlated with waist circumference. Considering previous studies, this result may be explained by the underestimation of DXA%BF, rather than by the overestimation of ADP%BF. In conclusion, ADP may be a useful method to measure %BF. However, BMC should be taken into consideration. Furthermore, DXA%BF may be underestimated in people with large waists."

Cells in soft tissues are in contact with each other, which causes tissue anisotropy, meaning that impedance changes along different cell directions, with part of low-frequency current also passing through cells. Hence, equivalent information on body impedance change is expected at all frequencies, which we proved in a dynamic condition of fluid removal with hemodialysis."

CD009647,0,12790384,0,Synthetic human alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide infusion in management after open heart operations.,"Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) induces water retention in the third space, and the mechanism is partially associated with the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has a gradual but strong diuretic effect and suppresses the RAAS activation. We examined the efficacy of synthetic human alpha-ANP (hANP) infusion in the management of the postoperative water balance control. Thirty patients (male:female = 18:12, 65.2 +/- 9.5 years) undergoing elective open heart operations in 2001 were allocated into one of two groups. Group H (n = 14) received 0.025 microg/kg/minute of synthetic hANP (HANP; Suntory Inc., Zeria Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) from the termination of CPB; the dose was gradually reduced to 0 until the 72nd postoperative hour. Group C (n = 16) served as control subjects. Twenty-four hours after operation, the central venous pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were significantly lower in group H than in group C, and the cardiac index was significantly higher in group H. Total volume of plasma solution infused during the initial 24 postoperative hours was significantly smaller in group H. The total dosages of furosemide and potassium-chloride added during the first 72 postoperative hours were significantly smaller in group H. On the first postoperative day, plasma levels of renin activity and aldosterone were significantly lower in group H. These results suggest that postoperative hANP infusion, which provides a sufficient diuretic effect and suppresses CPB induced RAAS activation, may simplify management after open heart operations."

There are several validated methods of screening, and clinical assessment and videofluoroscopy are the gold standard for the study of the mechanisms of OD in the elderly. Oropharyngeal residue is mainly caused by weak bolus propulsion forces due to tongue sarcopenia. The neural elements of swallow response are also impaired in older persons, with prolonged and delayed laryngeal vestibule closure and slow hyoid movement causing oropharyngeal aspirations. OD causes malnutrition, dehydration, impaired quality of life, lower respiratory tract infections, aspiration pneumonia, and poor prognosis including prolonged hospital stay and enhanced morbidity and mortality in several phenotypes of older patients ranging from independently living older people, hospitalized older patients and nursing home residents. Enhancing bolus viscosity of fluids greatly improves safety of swallow in all these patients.

Physical examination showed symmetrical flaccid paralysis of extremities. Both had the major biochemical abnormality of profound hypokalemia (1.4 and 1.8 mmol/L) accompanied by high urine K+ excretion and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. A positive urine anion gap and alkaline urine pointed to the diagnosis of distal renal tubular acidosis. Large doses of potassium chloride supplementation were required to restore muscle strength. Pertinent investigations, including elevated titers of antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor, positive anti-Ro antibody, low serum C3 and C4 levels, and delayed saliva excretion on salivary scintigraphy suggested Sjögren syndrome. Despite the lack of sicca syndrome at the initial presentation, both had development of typical sicca syndrome and positive Schirmer test at the 5-month and 1-year follow-up, respectively.

Nineteen healthy volunteers applied a moisturizer to the volar surface of their forearms for 3 weeks, once daily on one arm and twice daily on the other. The skin capacitance, distensibility, hysteresis and elasticity were measured in both treated areas and in an untreated regional control area. Measurements were carried out at baseline, at one-week intervals during the trial and one week after the termination. Data were assessed in a single-blind fashion. No change was found in any of the mechanical parameters in the moisturizer-treated skin compared to the control. The capacitance of skin was found to increase independently of dose. One week after termination of the treatment, the skin capacitance remained increased. No dose-response effect was seen, however. Long-term use of moisturizers increases skin capacitance significantly, but does not change the mechanical properties. In vivo skin hydration is a poor predictor of skin mechanics."

In the present study, the effects of age and body water volume on the resultant peak alcohol concentration were observed for females ranging in age from 21 to 81. The peak alcohol concentration was estimated by breath testing in three groups of female volunteer subjects: young (21 to 25 years old), middle-age (35 to 47 years old), and older (>60 years old) after ingestion of 30 g of alcohol. Bioelectrical impedance analysis and anthropometric equations were used to estimate total body water, percent body water, and percent body fat for each subject. Significantly higher blood alcohol concentrations were obtained in older females [mean blood alcohol concentration (+/-SD) = 0.0975+/-0.018], compared with younger females (0.0818+/-0.016 and 0.0811+/-0.012). The results suggest, however, that this effect cannot be fully explained by the notion that older persons have a smaller body water volume. Particular attention is paid to the difference between total body water in liters and body water expressed as a percentage of body weight. Evidence is offered to demonstrate that percent body fat is not a determinant of the blood alcohol level an individual will attain.

Three hundred patients admitted for ADHF underwent serial BIVA and BNP measurement. Therapy was titrated to reach a BNP value of <250 pg/ml, whenever possible. Patients were categorized as early responders (rapid BNP fall below 250 pg/ml); late responders (slow BNP fall below 250 pg/ml, after aggressive therapy); and non-responders (BNP persistently >250 pg/ml). Worsening of renal function (WRF) was evaluated during hospitalization. Death and rehospitalization were monitored with a 6-month follow-up. BNP value on discharge of ≤250 pg/ml led to a 25% event rate within 6 months (Group A: 17.4%; Group B: 21%, Chi2; n.s.), whereas a value >250 pg/ml (Group C) was associated with a far higher percentage (37%). At discharge, body hydration was 73.8 ± 3.2% in the total population and 73.2 ± 2.1, 73.5 ± 2.8, 74.1 ± 3.6% in the three groups, respectively. WRF was observed in 22.3% of the total. WRF occurred in 22% in Group A, 32% in Group B, and 20% in Group C (P = n.s.).

CD009647,0,300472,0,[The stress ulcer in the neurosurgical disease and the warning data (author's transl)].,"Twelve cases of G.I. tract bleeding, treated in the Department of Neurosurgery, Kobe University School of Medicine, were analyzed with the special reference to clinical data before the episode of G.I. tract bleeding. These 12 cases consist of 10 cases of aneurysm, 1 of metastatic brain tumor, and 1 of chronic subdural hematoma. The anterior communicating artery has the majority in the case of aneurysm by 50 per cent. In each case, C.B.C., bleeding time, coagulation time, serum electrolytes, serum glucose, glucosuria, steroid administration, blood pressure, hyperthermia, and water balance were reviewed retrospectively. Only serum glucose showed the specific abnormality with the average of 135 mg/dl (Hoffman method) before the episode of G.I. tract bleeding among them. In 1931, Cushing reported the clinical case of G.I. tract bleeding with intracranial disease and also experimental G.I. tract bleeding, in which discussion he concluded only parasympathetic nerve system has the involvement in the mechanism. In 1952, French, however, certified also the involvement of sympathetic nerve system in G.I. tract bleeding with the experimental results. In addition to this report, many experimental works under the standpoint of hypothalamus involvement in stress ulcer were undertaken. On the other hand, hyperglycemia and glycosuria in the stress have been reported as the results of clinical and experimental works. In 1971, Frohman concluded that only ventromedial nuclei has relation to the control of glycogen metabolism in hypothalamus from his experimental results. We concluded that this hyperglycemia before the evidence of G.I. tract bleeding due to the involvements of hypothalamus or other parts of C.N.S. in the neurosurgical disease is one clinical sign of the stimualtion to sympathetic nerve system that also can be a cause of G.I. tract bleeding, and this hyperglycemia before the evidence of G.I. tract bleeding should be paid attention as a warning datum."
CD009647,0,7702014,0,The use of bioelectrical impedance analysis to predict total body water in patients with cancer cachexia.,"The applicability of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to predict total body water (TBW) was assessed in 16 underweight [< 95% of ideal body weight (IBW)] and 25 normal-weight (> 95% of IBW) cancer patients. Although height2/resistance (ht2/R) proved to be a strong single predictor of TBW measured by deuterium dilution in both groups (normal-weight patients: r2 = 0.85, SEE 2.16 L; underweight patients: r2 = 0.86, SEE 2.24 L), TBW would be significantly overestimated in the underweight group if the prediction formula developed in the normal-weight group was used [bias 1.67 L (5%), 95% CI 0.20-3.15 L]. A systematic overestimation of TBW in the underweight patients was also found when TBW was predicted in our two patient groups by several previously published BIA formulas developed in normal-weight individuals. We conclude therefore, that although a similar relationship is found between ht2/R and TBW in normal-weight and underweight cancer patients, single-frequency BIA overestimates TBW in underweight patients when prediction formulas are used that have been developed in normal-weight subjects."

CD009647,0,2922983,0,Early detection of the TUR syndrome by marking the irrigating fluid with 1% ethanol.,"The ethanol concentration in the expired breath (EB-ethanol), the volumetric fluid balance and the serum sodium concentration were measured in the course of 60 transurethral resections of the prostate in which the irrigating fluid was 1.5% glycine + 1% ethanol. Measurement of EB-ethanol indicated absorption of irrigant at a rate of more than 150 ml in 10 min, as measured volumetrically. There was a significant direct linear relationship between EB-ethanol and the cumulative volume of irrigant absorbed (R2 = 0.83); this correlation was stronger when the duration of absorption was taken into account (R2 = 0.90). EB-ethanol was inversely related to the overall change in the serum sodium concentration during the operation (R2 = 0.88). Symptoms that are recognized components of the TUR syndrome developed in 8 of the 13 patients absorbing more than 11 of irrigant, while the ethanol exerted no adverse effects. The results of the study indicate that 1% ethanol is a suitable marker for monitoring irrigant absorption by means of the expired breath test in routine transurethral surgery. At this concentration the sensitivity of the test is adequate for detecting absorption, while the ethanol is less toxic than the irrigant fluid itself."
CD009647,0,1794018,0,Electrolyte disorders in the elderly.,"Electrolyte abnormalities in the elderly are common and it is most important to establish if drug treatment is the cause, as this is so easily remediable. The vast majority of electrolyte disturbances will settle with treatment of the underlying condition. Great attention must be paid to fluid balance to establish if the patient is receiving too little, which could induce hypernatraemia, or too much, particularly after surgery, which may induce hyponatraemia. Electrolyte levels should be checked ideally before and certainly after the prescription of diuretics. In the elderly it is important that the electrolyte levels be checked if the patient exhibits any vague symptoms, particularly if they are taking a diuretic. Care must be taken in replacing potassium as in most cases this is unnecessary and may have a significant morbidity."
CD009647,0,2682381,0,[Changes in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in liver cirrhosis with resistant ascites].,"The pathogenetic role of ADH in determining hyponatremia in patients with liver cirrhosis is still much debated. Osmotic stimuli are not able to inhibit secretion of ADH in refractory ascites and under such conditions the reduction in effective plasma volume has been put forward as the main cause. Twenty patients with liver cirrhosis and refractory ascites were studied before and during extraction-concentration-reinfusion (ECR) of ascitic fluid by means of Rhodiascit. ADH, renin, aldosterone, blood and urine osmolarity, plasma and urinary concentration of sodium, potassium, chlorine, and the clearance of free water were evaluated. All patients presented high renin values (15.4 +/- 11.7 ng/ml), aldosterone (341 +/- 172 ng/ml), ADH (6.3 +/- 5.2 pg/ml). During ECR, a significant drop was observed in renin (p less than 0.001), aldosterone (p less than 0.001) urinary osmolarity (p less than 0.001) and an equality significant increase in diuresis (p less than 0.001), natriuria (p less than 0.005), kaliuria (p less than 0.001) while ADH presented an irregular course: in 11 cases it remained unchanged, in 3 it fell and in 6 it presented a constant increase. To conclude, data suggest that the diminished filtrate reaching the distal tubule constitutes the greatest cause of the inability to dilute urine in many patients with cirrhosis and that ADH is a permissive rather than a primary factor."
CD009647,0,17083478,0,"Degeneration of ingestion-related brainstem nuclei in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, 3, 6 and 7.","Dysphagia, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies, weight loss and dehydration, represents a risk factor for aspiration pneumonia. Although clinical studies have reported the occurrence of dysphagia in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), type 3 (SCA3), type 6 (SCA6) and type 7 (SCA7), there are neither detailed clinical records concerning the kind of ingestive malfunctions which contribute to dysphagia nor systematic pathoanatomical studies of brainstem regions involved in the ingestive process. In the present study we performed a systematic post mortem study on thick serial tissue sections through the ingestion-related brainstem nuclei of 12 dysphagic patients who suffered from clinically diagnosed and genetically confirmed spinocerebellar ataxias assigned to the CAG-repeat or polyglutamine diseases (two SCA2, seven SCA3, one SCA6 and two SCA7 patients) and evaluated their medical records. Upon pathoanatomical examination in all of the SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 patients, a widespread neurodegeneration of the brainstem nuclei involved in the ingestive process was found. The clinical records revealed that all of the SCA patients were diagnosed with progressive dysphagia and showed dysfunctions detrimental to the preparatory phase of the ingestive process, as well as the lingual, pharyngeal and oesophageal phases of swallowing. The vast majority of the SCA patients suffered from aspiration pneumonia, which was the most frequent cause of death in our sample. The findings of the present study suggest (i) that dysphagia in SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 patients may be associated with widespread neurodegeneration of ingestion-related brainstem nuclei; (ii) that dysphagic SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 patients may suffer from dysfunctions detrimental to all phases of the ingestive process; and (iii) that rehabilitative swallow therapy which takes specific functional consequences of the underlying brainstem lesions into account might be helpful in preventing aspiration pneumonia, weight loss and dehydration in SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 patients."

Changes in plasma levels of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and testosterone as well as salt-water balance, antithrombin III, fibrinolytic activity, plasma lipoproteins known to influence the risk of cardiovascular complications, were recorded during the initial 2 months. The plasma testosterone, LH and FSH concentrations were suppressed. The plasma volume was increased and the plasma albumin concentration was decreased. The antithrombin III concentration and the tissue fibrinolytic activity were decreased. The low density lipoprotein (LDL) level decreased and the high density lipoprotein (HDL) level increased. The recorded changes of cardiovascular risk factors indicate that the risk of water retention and thereby congestive heart failure and the risk for thromboembolic disease are increased during oestrogen treatment. The changes in lipoproteins with a marked elevation of the HDL/LDL ratio are thought to retard the development of atherosclerosis."
CD009647,0,15813652,0,Cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors: when should they be used in the elderly?,"Chronic pain in the elderly is frequently a result of arthritic disorders, particularly osteoarthritis. The cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are as effective as standard NSAIDs for the relief of pain and for improving function in elderly patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of serious gastroduodenal adverse reactions but there is evidence that they carry a lower risk for these adverse effects than standard NSAIDs, except when there is concurrent aspirin use. Since gastroduodenal disorders are the most frequently reported serious adverse effects of NSAIDs and these disorders occur more frequently in the elderly, COX-2 inhibitors offer an alternative to standard NSAIDs in this age group. However, they are not appropriate for many patients with cardiovascular and renal disease. The adverse reaction profile of the COX-2 inhibitors has confirmed the role of the COX-2 enzyme in renal function, salt and water homeostasis and the vascular endothelium. Thus, like standard NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause renal failure, hypertension and exacerbation of cardiac failure. Of note is that these disorders are dose related. Thus, there are good reasons to avoid high doses of COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly. Clinical trials indicate that daily doses of rofecoxib 12.5 mg, celecoxib 100-200 mg, valdecoxib 10mg and etoricoxib 60 mg are the minimum effective doses of these agents. Data from the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme indicate that celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day are/were the most commonly prescribed doses and that 6% of patients had taken rofecoxib 50 mg/day for longer than recommended. Recent research indicates that COX-2 inhibitors have a thrombotic potential, especially in high doses and when use is prolonged, and this further limits the extent to which they can be used in the elderly. Important interactions with COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly include those with warfarin, which can result in loss of control of anticoagulation, and those with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists and diuretics, which can result in loss of control of blood pressure and cardiac failure and, in hypovolaemic conditions, renal failure. The clinical significance of an interaction between celecoxib and aspirin to reduce the antiplatelet effect of the latter drug is unknown. Preliminary information from spontaneous reporting systems indicates that there may be differences in the risk of cardiac failure and hypertension between standard NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors and between rofecoxib and celecoxib. More formal studies using equivalent doses are needed to test this observation. Use of COX-2 inhibitors may be considered in the elderly to reduce the risk of gastroduodenal complications associated with standard NSAIDs but only when consideration has first been given to use of less toxic medicines as alternatives or supplements, the appropriate dose of the COX-2 inhibitor or standard NSAID, the presence and possible impact of co-morbidities, and the implications of taking COX-2 inhibitors with any concomitant medications. Equally important is regular monitoring of the patient taking a COX-2 inhibitor for efficacy and adverse effects, and ensuring that the patient has a continuing need to keep taking the drug. Close attention also needs to be paid to intercurrent illnesses and new prescriptions that may reduce the safety of the COX-2 inhibitor. A standard NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor may be equally effective as a COX-2 inhibitor in reducing the risk of gastroduodenal toxicity and if used the same prescribing advice applies. Current knowledge concerning the thrombotic potential of COX-2 inhibitors suggests that this combination, if tolerated, may be preferable to a COX-2 inhibitor, particularly where prolonged use is required. This knowledge also indicates that for patients with or at high risk of ischaemic heart disease or stroke, COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated."

A 77-year old woman, who complained of recent development of excessive thirst, polyuria and polydipsia, was referred to our hospital. The daily urine volume was markedly increased to 6 L. DDAVP administration effectively reduced urine volume and increased urine osmolality. The loading test using high-osmolar sodium chloride showed impaired excretion of vasopressin discordant with plasma osmolar changes. The anterior pituitary function was normal. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed thickening of the pituitary stalk and a lack of high-intensity signal of the neurohypophysis on T1-weighted images, suggestive of lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis. The thickness of pituitary stalk on MRI improved 6 months later. DI was controlled with DDAVP for 40 days. This was followed by stabilization of the daily urine volume to less than 2.5 L without DDAVP. Our case is the eldest case of central DI associated with infundibulo-neurohypophysitis. The rapid remission of pituitary changes on MRI provides an insight that spontaneously partial remission of central DI may occur, resulting in transient polyuria and polydipsia."

Symptoms, interval before diagnosis, and stage and grade of lesion were analyzed and correlated with survival rates. Although stage was the most critical determinant of survival, grade, presence or absence of dysuria and delay in diagnosis were also important. Preoperative radiotherapy caused downstaging in 41.2 per cent of patients, with complete disappearance of tumor in some. Postoperative complications from cystectomy and from various forms of urinary diversion were correlated with the type of diversion, type of ureteral anastomosis, radiotherapy and stents. Improved operative techniques, method of fluid balance, and preoperative and postoperative care have led to a progressively decreased operative mortality in patients with carcinoma of the bladder."

CD009647,0,10668951,0,The importance of bioimpedance (BIA) analysis and Cardio Tens (24-h ABPM and ECG) monitoring in the dialysis programme.,"The authors performed bioimpedance analysis and Cardio Tens (24-h ABPM and ECG) monitoring in 66 patients (28 males, 38 females) treated in the chronic haemodialysis programme. They investigated the correlations between the body weights before, during and after dialysis, the changes of the water compartments and fat body weight, and the recorded values of blood pressure and ECG alterations. On the basis of the measurements by this non-invasive method it is concluded that, as a result of dialysis and ultrafiltration, the total body weight and total body water are decreasing in a greater extent in men than in women. By gradually decreasing the body weight, the optimal dry weight could be attained, which resulted in the reduction of blood pressure or even normotension. In the course of dialysis the values of bioimpedance and bioreactance increase. The intradialytic hypotensive indispositions were accompanied by a significant reduction of bioreactance (n = 16). The BMI, total body weight and total body water hyperlipidaemic, hypalbuminic patients with treatment-resistant hypertension are considerably larger than those of the patients with normal blood pressure (p<0.01). During Cardio Tens monitoring 53% of the patients proved to be dippers, 47% of whom had ST depression, while in 73% of the non-dippers ischaemic alterations were encountered together with high hyperbaric impact values. The total body weights and total water compartments of patients returning to dialysis with an excess body weight of more than 3.5 kg were significantly larger than of patients who were cooperative and had no oedemas. In the last hour of dialysis and during the following few hours, arrhythmias and ST depressions of the cardiovascularly instable patients appeared more frequently. The total water compartments of these patients are significantly larger than normotensive, normolipaemic patients with appropriate serum albumin concentrations. The importance of the BIA and Cardio Tens monitoring in determining the optimal dry body weight and improving the cardiovascular condition of the patients is emphasized."

CD009647,0,16479069,0,Assessment of fluid shifts of body compartments using both bioimpedance analysis and blood volume monitoring.,"Fluid shifts are commonplace in chronic hemodialysis patients during the intra- and interdialytic periods. In this study, we evaluated fluid shifts of body compartments using both bioimpedance spectroscopy and blood volume monitoring from the start to the end of hemodialysis. 24 stable hemodialysis patients were included on the study. Relative change of blood volume was progressively reduced from the start to the end of hemodialysis (1 hr, -7.22+/-3.23%; 2 hr, -9.78+/-4.69%; 3 hr, -12.88+/-5.65%; 4 hr, -15.41+/-6.54%, respectively). Mean % reduction of intracellular fluid was not significantly different to that of extracellular fluid at the end of hemodialysis (delta ICF, -6.58+/-5.34% vs. delta ECF, -7.07+/-5.12%). Mean % fluid reduction of arms, legs and trunk was -11.98+/-6.76%, -6.43+/-4.37% and -7.47+/-4.56%, respectively at the end of hemodialysis. There were 3 characteristic patterns in blood-volume change. Similar amounts of fluid were removed from the extracellular and intracellular compartments during hemodialysis, with the arms showing the greatest loss in terms of body segments. The pattern of blood volume change measured by blood volume monitoring may be useful for more accurate determination of dry-weight and for correcting volume status in hemodialysis patients."
CD009647,0,16951456,0,Thoracic versus whole body bioimpedance measurements: the relation to hydration status and hypertension in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"The whole body bioimpedance technique is a highly promising non-invasive, reproducible, fast and inexpensive bed-side method for monitoring hydration status. Using segmental bioimpedance measurements, it is possible to obtain information about the fluid change in each body segment (Song, Lee, Kim and Kim 1999 Perit. Dial. Int. 19 386-90). In this pilot study we have measured 25 male patients (30-65 yr, BMI 20-32 kg m(-2)) undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Tetrapolar impedance measurements were obtained using the right-side technique (whole body), and a segmental impedance method focused in the thorax region. Blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken manually with a sphygmomanometer. Patients were classified as either stable (group 0) or unstable (group 1) using clinical parameters of overall cardiovascular risk. The Mahalanobis distance (dM2) was calculated for the mean blood pressure (BP(mean)), and the impedance parameter R normalized by body height H for the right-side (R(RS)/H) and the thorax segment (R(TH)/H). Differences between groups were significant (p < 0.0001) for R(TH)/H and for BP(mean), and less significant (p = 0.016) for R(RS)/H. Group 1 patients showed a small dM2 as compared with a reference patient (a critical patient with acute lung edema) with high BP(mean) and low values of R(TH)/H and R(RS)/H. Moreover, Group 0 patients showed a larger dM2 with respect to the reference patient, with lower BP(mean) and higher values of R(TH)/H and R(RS)/H. All patients classified as unstable by clinical assessment were correctly classified using R(TH)/H in conjunction with BP(mean) using dM2. Segmental-monofrequency non-invasive bioimpedance of the thoracic region could provide a simple, objective non-invasive method of support for facilitating the clinical assessment of CAPD patients."

CD009647,0,10361869,0,"Effect of intravenous saline, albumin, or hydroxyethylstarch on blood volume during combined ultrafiltration and hemodialysis.","It is generally advocated to use saline or albumin infusions during symptomatic hypotension during dialysis. However, because of their side effects and/or costs, they are of limited use. Hydroxyethylstarch (HES), a synthetic colloid with a long-standing volume effect, is used in the management of hypovolemia. In this study, the efficacy of three fluids (isotonic saline [0.9%], albumin [20%], and HES [10%]) was assessed during three treatment sessions with combined ultrafiltration and hemodialysis, which differed in the type of fluid given intravenously. Changes in relative blood volume (BV), systolic BP (SBP), and vascular reactivity (venous tone [VT]) were compared. An intravenous infusion of 100 ml of fluid was given when the decrease in BV versus baseline was more than 10% as measured by a continuous optical reflection method. The ultrafiltration was continued. BV decreased significantly versus baseline independent of the intravenous fluid administration in all three treatment sessions. However, when we compared BV values at the end of the dialysis session with those at the time of infusion, BV continued to decrease significantly with saline (change in BV -4.56 +/- 2.75%; P < 0.05) and albumin (change in BV -2.13 +/- 2.51%; P < 0.05), but not with HES (change in BV -0.15 +/- 2.17%; NS). Between albumin and HES there were no significant differences in changes in BV (NS), whereas between HES and saline (P < 0.05) and between albumin and saline (P < 0.05) the differences in BV changes were significant. SBP remained unchanged within each session. Although SBP tended to decrease more with saline compared to albumin and HES, the difference was not significant. The higher decrease in BV and SBP with saline was counterbalanced by a significantly higher increase in VT, while VT remained unchanged in the other two sessions. It is concluded that HES is a promising fluid in preserving blood volume, comparable to albumin, but superior to saline."

Case records from patients in one city (population 350 000) presenting between 1980 and 1997 with hypertension, hyponatremia, and evidence of renal ischemia were scrutinized. Thirty-two patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were identified. Admission supine arterial pressures were high (mean 228/124 mm Hg), but there was a vigorous fall in pressure on standing (26/12.7 mm Hg recorded in 27 patients). Mean plasma concentrations of sodium (129.7 mmol/L) and potassium (2.7 mmol/L) were low, and 24-hour urine protein excretion was elevated in 19 of 26 patients. Twenty-two of the 32 patients were female, the majority were asthenic, and all but 5 were smokers. Symptoms precipitating hospitalization were headache, clouding of consciousness, confusion, weakness, weight loss, thirst, and polyuria. Plasma renin levels, measured in 20 patients, were elevated in most cases and correlated inversely (r=-0.63, P<0.01) with the plasma sodium concentration. The hyponatremic-hypertensive syndrome in patients with renal ischemia is not rare: Rather, it is underreported. It tends to affect elderly asthenic women who smoke heavily. Stimulation of renin release from the ischemic kidney is probably central to the pathophysiology. The syndrome deserves better recognition to ensure appropriate investigations and management."

Principal component factor analysis, known group comparisons, and multiple logistic regression were used to evaluate the criterion-related validity and reliability of the DRAC. After reducing the number of items on the DRAC on the basis of a correlation matrix, a single-factor solution with moderate internal consistency was supported. Further validity analysis demonstrated that NH residents with higher urine-specific gravity scored higher than those who had lower specific gravity. The psychometric properties of the DRAC indicate that it has potential in determining dehydration risk in NH residents. Future refinement of the instrument is also discussed."

CD009647,0,15252373,0,"Heat stress: characteristics, pathophysiology and avoidable mistakes.","In August 2003 an exceptional heatwave was recorded in Europe. The authors would like to describe 6 patients for which the intensivist was called as a consultant. All patients had a skin temperature >40 degrees C, central nervous system impairment, severe hyponatremia [124.7 mEq/l+/-5.6 (range 117-130)] and severe metabolic acidosis [BE -6.28 mEq/l+/-3.55 (range -9.5-0), HCO3- 17.75 mEq/l+/-3.25 (range 13.4-21.9)]. All patients had decreased platelet count and coagulation abnormalities. Two patients were hypertensive, 4 hypotensive. The heat stress due to the hot environment is characterized by systemic inflammatory response (as in severe sepsis) and hemodynamic impairment (as in hypovolemic shock). The association between hypovolemia and altered microcirculation leads to cell energy failure with metabolic lactic acidosis. The energy failure may induce structural irreversible damage of mitochondria. It is possible to differentiate, during energy failure, the irreversible or reversible condition by volume loading and vasoactive drugs challenge tests. In fact, if the hemodynamic correction is associated with normalization of SvO2 with disappearance of metabolic acidosis, this suggests hemodynamic impairment with intact mitochondrial function. In contrast, if the hemodynamic improvement with normalization of SvO2 is associated and acidosis persists, this suggests irreversible structural mitochondrial damage. The threshold between reversibility and irreversibility is likely time dependent, as suggested by biochemical consideration and by 2 large randomized studies on hemodynamic treatment. The comparative analysis of these 2 studies suggests that the time of intervention may lead to significant differences in mortality. In these patients time is essential."
CD009647,0,3517066,0,Sodium and water balance in chronic congestive heart failure.,"As the characteristics of sodium and water balance in heart failure remain undefined, we evaluated the hemodynamic, metabolic, and hormonal effects of balanced sodium intake in 10 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We discontinued diuretics to avoid their confounding influence, and all patients received 1 wk of 10 meq and 100 meq balanced sodium intake and controlled free water. Comparing sodium intake of 10 with 100 meq, the following observations were made. There was weight gain (2.0 kg) and increased sodium excretion (11 +/- 3 to 63 +/- 15 meq/24 h), unaccompanied by increase of blood volume. Both renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system activity were greater during the 10 meq diet, and suppressed with the 100 meq sodium diet. For both diets, plasma renin and urinary aldosterone excretion were correlated with urinary sodium excretion (r = -0.768, r = -0.726, respectively; P less than 0.005). Systemic hemodynamics were minimally changed with increased sodium intake. However, reversal of vasoconstriction by captopril during the 10 meq diet, and its ineffectiveness during the 100 meq diet, indicated a renin-dependent mechanism in the former, and a renin-independent mechanism in the latter diet. There were two subgroups of response to the 100 meq diet: one group (n = 5) achieved neutral balance, while the second (n = 5) avidly retained sodium and water. Renin-angiotensin system activity was significantly higher in the latter group, and the mechanism for differences in sodium excretion for the subgroups could not be identified by blood volume or hemodynamic parameters. Orthostatic hypotension during tilt was greater during the 10 meq sodium diet, and in all cases, related to ineffective hemodynamic and hormonal compensatory responses."

There was after irradiation a tendency towards weight loss, connected with some increase of relative total body water content and also its extracellular fraction. The weight loss was due to a decrease of body fat and cell mass, whereas extracellular spaces tended to increase. There was a tendency towards a drop in plasma sodium concentration and an increase of its total content in extracellular water. A significant drop of the potassium serum concentration was observed."

CD009647,0,9288866,0,Proportional changes in body fluid with hemodialysis evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and transthoracic bioimpedance with particular emphasis on the thoracic region.,"Alterations in body composition during extracorporeal hemodialysis (HD) were investigated in 12 hemodialysis patients (9 males and 3 females, mean age 50 +/- 15 years) with a mean ultrafiltration of 2.6 +/- 1.0 L. Analysis was performed using a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry technique (DXA), which measures 3 principal components of the body: fat mass (FM): lean body mass (LBM), i.e., all soft tissues excluding fat; and bone mineral content (BMC). These 3 components were calculated for the whole body and for different body regions (namely, the thorax, trunk, lower limbs, and upper limbs). The thoracic cage region could be defined manually, separately from the trunk, and its tissue composition was calculated. DXA analysis was performed concomitant with a measurement of the basal thoracic impedance (TFI) by bioimpedance cardiography prior to and 1 h after dialysis. We found a significant decrease in the total LBM, from 55.8 +/- 8.8 to 53.3 +/- 9.3 kg (p < 0.05), but no change in either the FM or BMC. Moreover, there was a disproportional reduction in the LBM in different regions, being significantly greater in the thorax (7.47 +/- 3.7%) than in the other body regions (trunk 4.3 +/- 2.0%, lower limbs 5.4 +/- 2.1%, and upper limbs 4.7 +/- 1.5%). Regarding bioimpedance, a stronger significant correlation was detected between the percentage changes in the TFI and the changes in thoracic fluid (r = 0.80, p < 0.01) than between the changes in the TFI and the changes in the total body fluid (r = 0.63, p < 0.01). The absolute values of the TFI were also significantly and negatively correlated to the thoracic lean mass to fat mass ratio, both before and after HD (r = 0.82, p < 0.001 and r = 0.86, p < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, DXA is a very sensitive technique to detect fluid changes during HD in the thorax when the thoracic cavity is defined as a region of interest as well as for the whole body. The data also indicate an extracellular compartmental imbalance between different regions with a significantly greater change in the thoracic region. Transthoracic bioimpedance is a useful technique for evaluating the HD induced changes in the thoracic fluid, rather than total body fluid."
CD009647,0,10632102,0,Higher sedentary energy expenditure in patients with Huntington's disease.,"Weight loss is common among patients with Huntington's disease (HD), although the mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon are not known. We measured 24-hour sedentary energy expenditure (24-hour EE) and sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) in a human respiratory chamber in 17 patients with mild to moderate HD and 17 control subjects matched for age, sex, and body mass index. Total energy expenditure was measured during 7 days in free-living conditions, using the doubly labeled water technique. Body weight, fat mass, and fat-free mass (measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) were similar in patients with HD and control subjects. Twenty-four-hour EE was 14% higher in HD patients than controls in absolute terms (2,038+/-98 vs 1,784+/-68 kcal/24 hours) and after adjustment for age, sex, fat mass, and fat-free mass (1,998+/-45 vs. 1,824+/-45 kcal/24 hours). In contrast, SMR and total energy expenditure were similar in patients and controls both in absolute terms (1,314+/-38 vs 1,316+/-42 and 2,402+/-102 vs. 2,373+/-98 kcal/24 hours, respectively) and after adjustment. Spontaneous physical activity measured by radar in the chamber and the ratio of 24-hour EE to SMR were significantly higher in HD patients than controls (11.4+/-1.4 vs 6.1+/-0.6% and 1.54+/-0.05 vs 1.36+/-0.03, respectively). In the group as a whole, 24-hour EE/SMR correlated with spontaneous physical activity. Among HD patients, both 24-hour EE/SMR and spontaneous physical activity correlated with the severity of chorea, but SMR and total energy expenditure did not. There were no differences in reported energy intake during 7 days in patients with HD compared with controls. The results of this study indicate that sedentary energy expenditure is higher in patients with HD than in controls in proportion to the severity of the movement disorder. Total free-living energy expenditure is not higher, however, because patients with HD appear to engage in less voluntary physical activity."

The patient initially presented anorexia, vomiting, arthralgias, malaise, and weight loss, which progressively deteriorated during the subsequent 6 months. He was admitted to the hospital with fever, confusion, severe cachexia, sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, hyponatremia, and inability to stand or walk due to severe flexion contractures of the lower extremities (from hips to knees). The flexion contractures were not resolved by physiotherapy or diazepam administration. Due to his life-threatening condition the patient was empirically submitted to glucocorticoid replacement therapy and a remarkable relief from all the above symptoms was observed. A subsequent thorough endocrine investigation suggested the diagnosis of isolated ACTH deficiency (IAD) of unknown pathogenetic mechanism. Hence, in patients with ""flexion contractures"" syndrome, the pituitary adrenal axis should be evaluated."
CD009647,0,12369019,0,Prevalence of orthostatic hypotension among patients presenting with syncope in the ED.,"We sought to determine the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension as a cause of syncope in the emergency setting, and describe the characteristics of patients diagnosed with this condition. Blood pressure orthostatic changes were measured prospectively in a standardized fashion up to 10 minutes, or until symptoms occurred, in all consecutive patients with syncope as a chief complaint presenting in the emergency department (ED) of a primary and tertiary care hospital. Patients unable to stand-up were excluded. Hypotension was considered to be the cause of syncope when there was: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) >or= 20 mm Hg with simultaneous symptoms; (2) a decrease in SBP between 10 and 20 mm Hg, but a SBP <or= 90 mm Hg with or without symptoms; and (3) a nonsignificant decrease in SBP in the ED, but a prehospital value <or= 80 mm Hg was documented that prompted fluid therapy before standardized measurements. Among 788 patients with syncope seen in the ED during a 20-month period, 650 were included in the study, and 579 (89%) had standardized measurements of SBP. According to diagnostic criteria, orthostatic hypotension was considered to be the cause of syncope in 156 of them (24%). Fifty-eight patients (37%) had drug-induced hypotension, 33 (21%) hypovolemia, 19 (12%) postprandial hypotension, and 46 (29%) idiopathic hypotension. Asymptomatic SBP changes >or= 20 mm Hg were found in 10% of patients with syncope attributed to other causes. Compared with patients with vasovagal disorder, those with orthostatic hypotension were older; had more comorbid conditions including hypertension, organic heart disease, and abnormal electrocardiogram; were taking more hypotensive medications; and required more frequently hospitalization (P <.01). We concluded that standardized blood pressure measurement in the ED enabled to strongly implicate orthostatic hypotension as a cause of syncope in 24% of patients with this symptom. Drug-related hypotension was the most frequent cause for this disorder."

CD009647,0,14587130,0,Evaluation and management of urinary incontinence in elderly women.,"Urinary incontinence is a common problem among older women, with a great impact on their quality of life, self-esteem and ability to live independently. Although often neglected by both patients and health-care providers, a variety of behavioral, pharmacologic and surgical interventions are now available to resolve or improve the symptoms of most older women who are incontinent. Since many of the factors which contribute to continence in late life lie outside of the bladder, the assessment of urinary incontinence in older women must extend beyond the genitourinary tract, assessing domains such as mobility, fluid balance and cognition. The primary care physician in uniquely placed in being able to diagnose this problem, to initiate treatment in many patients and to refer those requiring additional specialized expertise."
CD009647,0,10750642,0,Fludrocortisone and sleeping in the head-up position limit the postural decrease in cardiac output in autonomic failure.,"Treatment with head-up tilt sleeping and low-dose fludrocortisone effectively minimizes orthostatic symptoms and increases orthostatic blood pressure in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the improvement in orthostatic blood pressure during combined treatment with low-dose fludrocortisone and nocturnal head-up tilt in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can be attributed to expansion of plasma volume or to increased total peripheral resistance. The effects of a 3-week treatment with fludrocortisone and nocturnal head-up tilting on the postural changes in arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output (pulse contour) were evaluated in eight consecutive patients with orthostatic hypotension. The period during which the patients were able to remain in the standing position without orthostatic complaints increased minimally from 3 to 10 minutes. The decrease in arterial pressure after 1 minute of standing--(means with standard deviations in parentheses) systolic, 49 (20) mm Hg; diastolic, 18 (11) mm Hg--before treatment was produced by a greater than normal decrease in cardiac output: 37% (10%) in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension versus -14% (8%) in control subjects. Treatment increased upright arterial pressure from 83 (19) mm Hg systolic and 55 (13) mm Hg diastolic to 114 (22) mm Hg systolic and 60 (16) mm Hg diastolic by limiting the decrease in cardiac output. Body weight increased but hematocrit did not change. Leg pressure-volume relationship decreased in the two patients studied. The responses of plasma renin activity and aldosterone to orthostatic stress prior to treatment were subnormal and became even lower after treatment. The improvement in upright blood pressure in orthostatic hypotension during treatment with fludrocortisone and nocturnal head-up sleeping is the result of a reduction in the orthostatic decrease in cardiac output. Preliminary data suggest that the expanded body fluid volume is allocated to the perivascular space rather than to the intravascular space."
CD009647,0,10475285,0,An assessment of the safety of short-term amiodarone therapy in cardiac surgical patients with fentanyl-isoflurane anesthesia.,"In previously published case reports and a retrospective study, investigators have noted that amiodarone may cause substantial hemodynamic instability when combined with fentanyl-containing anesthesia regimens. We performed the present study to evaluate the safety of short-term amiodarone therapy when combined with a fentanyl-containing anesthesia regimen in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled format. After institutional approval and written informed consent, patients scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting or valvular surgery were randomly allocated to receive amiodarone (3.4 g over 5 days or 2.2 g over 24 hours) or placebo before surgery. Four indicators for hemodynamic instability were assessed: 1) a net increase in fluid balance during surgery of >2 L; 2) use of dopamine at a rate >10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1); 3) use of other vasopressive catecholamines; and 4) use of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor or intraaortic balloon pump. Systolic, diastolic, and central venous pressures were measured before fentanyl administration, before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and after separation from CPB. Overall, 84 patients (45 patients in the amiodarone group, 39 in the placebo group) were enrolled and completed the study. There were no significant differences between the two groups in any indicator for hemodynamic instability or the indicators of instability combined. After CPB, there was a significantly lower systolic blood pressure in the amiodarone group compared with the placebo group (112 +/- 12 vs 117 +/- 14 mm Hg; P = 0.049). However, there was a trend toward smaller IV fluid requirements during surgery in the amiodarone group compared with the placebo group (438 +/- 867 vs 907 +/- 1640 mL; P = 0.09). We found no increased risk of hemodynamic compromise after short-term amiodarone therapy among patients receiving a fentanyl-containing anesthesia regimen during open heart surgery."
CD009647,0,17076765,0,Morphological substrate of the catecholaminergic input of the vasopressin neuronal system in humans.,"It has been postulated that the stress response is associated with water balance via regulating vasopressin release. Nausea, surgical stress and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia were shown to stimulate vasopressin secretion in humans. Increased vasopressin release in turn induces water resorption through the kidneys. Although the mechanism of the stress-mediated vasopressin release is not entirely understood, it is generally accepted that catecholamines play a crucial role in influencing water balance by modulating the secretion of vasopressin. However, the morphological substrate of this modulation has not yet been established. The present study utilised double-label immunohistochemistry to reveal putative juxtapositions between tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive (IR) catecholaminergic system and the vasopressin systems in the human hypothalamus. In the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, numerous vasopressin-IR neurones received TH-IR axon varicosities. Analysis of these juxtapositions with high magnification combined with oil immersion did not reveal any gaps between the contacted elements. In conclusion, the intimate associations between the TH-IR and vasopressin-IR elements may be functional synapses and may represent the morphological basis of vasopressin release modulated by stressors. Because certain vasopressin-IR perikarya receive no detectable TH innervations, it is possible that additional mechanisms may participate in the stress-influenced vasopressin release."

CD009647,0,22890206,0,Evaluation of skin surface hydration state and barrier function of stratum corneum of dorsa of hands and heels treated with PROTECT X2 skin protective cream.,"Skin roughness is a term commonly used in Japan to describe a poor skin condition related to a rough and dry skin surface that develops as a result of various damaging effects from the environment or skin inflammation. Recovery from skin roughness requires skin care for a long period, thus it is important to prevent development of such skin changes. PROTECT X2 contains agents used for a protective covering of the skin from frequent hand washing or use of alcohol-based disinfectants. These unique components are also thought to be effective to treat skin roughness of the dorsa of the hands and heels. In the present study, we evaluated the effectiveness of PROTECT X2 to increase skin surface hydration state, as well as enhance the barrier function of the stratum corneum of the dorsa of the hands and heels in elderly individuals. A total of 8 elderly subjects and their caretakers without any skin diseases participated in the study. They applied PROTECT X2 by themselves to the dorsum area of 1 hand and heel 3 to 5 times daily for 1 month, while the opposite sides were left untreated. We measured stratum corneum (SC) hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) before beginning treatment, then 1 week and 1 month after the start of treatment to compare between the treated and untreated skin. SC hydration state after applications of PROTECT X2 was 1.5- to 3.0-fold higher than that of the untreated skin in the dorsa of both hands and heels, indicating that the moisturizing ingredients accompanied by water were replenished in those areas where the cream was applied. Also, TEWL in the dorsum of the hands was 17.0-27.9% lower on the treated side, indicating improvement in SC barrier function. On the basis of these findings, we concluded that PROTECT X2 enhances water-holding in the SC and aids the barrier function of the skin in the dorsum of the hands. In addition, we consider that this formulation is useful for not only protecting the hands from the effects of such agents as detergents and alcohol-based disinfectants, but also for protecting heel skin covered by a thick SC from dry and cold conditions such as those encountered in winter. However, since the SC in that area is much thicker than that of the hands, the barrier function was not significantly improved within 1 month of daily treatments."

CD009647,0,2199019,0,"Perioperative renal, fluid, and electrolyte management.","Normal physiologic changes of aging increase the likelihood of renal-electrolyte disorders in the elderly surgical patient. The most important of these changes are a decrease in the GFR, decreased urinary concentrating ability, and narrowed limits for the excretion of water, sodium, potassium, and acid. Because of the decrease in GFR, the elderly surgical patient is at increased risk for virtually every cause of acute renal failure, an outcome associated with a mortality of greater than 50%. Certain types of surgery, especially cardiac, aortic, and biliary tract operations, are associated with a higher risk of acute renal failure than are others. The most important principles of prevention in the elderly surgical patient are to maintain normal intravascular volume and avoid hypovolemia. Meticulous attention must be paid to salt and water balance and to drug dosing. Should perioperative renal insufficiency occur, evaluation and management in the elderly patient are similar to usual practices in a younger individual."

Our purpose was to evaluate the hypothesis that clinical judgment alone is inadequate for a reliable estimate of cardiopulmonary status in critically ill patients. Physician assessments (high, normal, or low) of cardiac index (CI) and thoracic fluid content (TFC) were made in 68 acute trauma cases and compared to the results obtained with impedance cardiography (ICG). Physician assessment using clinical judgment alone was correct only 42 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively, for CI and TFC. There was very little difference in heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), and the number of injured systems between the incorrect and correct assessments of CI. However, the mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was markedly higher for the incorrect than the correct CI values (18.8 +/- 9.3 vs 14.2 +/- 9.8, P = 0.0589). Thus, there is a need for an objective measurement of CI and TFC especially in the more severely injured patient. The inaccuracy of the clinical exam strongly suggests the need for a supplemental measurement, which the new and improved ICG monitor could provide."

We investigated the relationships among intra and extravascular fluids, hemodynamics and neurohumoral pattern following plasma water subtraction. In 55 patients with CHF (35 in NYHA class IV, Group A, and 20 in NYHA class II-III, Group B), removal of 3242 +/- 201 ml and 1741 +/- 119 ml of plasma water acutely reduced plasma volume (calculated from hematocrit changes) by -20.7% and -12.9% in Group A and in Group B, respectively. Plasma volume returned to baseline values within 48 hours. Body weight and ventricular filling pressures also lowered and remained so for 2 days. After ultrafiltration urinary output increased and norepinephrine, renin activity and aldosterone plasma levels decreased in Group A, while a fall of diuresis and a rapid rise of plasma levels of the 3 hormones were observed in Group B. Two days after ultrafiltration the persistence of reduced body weight with recovery of plasma volume indicates a shift of fluid from the extravascular to the intravascular compartment. The different behaviour of hemodynamics, urinary output and neurohumoral pattern changes observed in the 2 groups after ultrafiltration, suggest that in severe heart failure (Group A) the physiological responses to intravascular volume depletion are unsettled while are preserved in less severe stages of the disease (Group B)."
CD009647,0,506939,0,Hypovolemia and hypotension complicating management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.,"After the acute onset of heart failure and in the absence of acute myocardial infarction, plasma volume may occasionally be depleted to the extent that the patient presents with clinical signs of circulatory shock. In five patients, the acute onset of clinical and radiographic signs of cardiogenic pulmonary edema were associated with reduction in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output. The pulmonary arterial wedge pressure was within normal limits but a reduction in plasma volume was demonstrated, which is best explained by the rapid translocation of plasma water that represented pulmonary (and most likely also peripheral) edema fluid. The infusion of 5 percent albumin solution significantly increased cardiac output, mean arterial pressure and cardiac work, reversed lactic acidosis, enhanced furosemide-induced diuresis and was followed by a decrease in both clinical and radiographic signs of pulmonary edema. These observations confirm that volume expansion may constitute appropriate treatment for some patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema who may present with hypotension and who are unresponsive to conventional therapy."
CD009647,0,8964631,0,Bioelectrical impedance and hemodialysis.,"Bioimpedance is a simple and non-invasive method of assessing body fluid composition. The aim of our study was to evaluate the reilability of impedance: a) to measure urea distribution volume considered to be coextensive with total body water (TBW); b) to assess the changes in body fluid compartments before and after dialysis; c) to predict hypotensive episodes. In twelve hemodialysis patients, TBW measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) before a dialysis session was significantly correlated with the urea distribution volume estimated by dialysis direct quantification (r = 0.64, p < 0.05) and with TBW calculated by the Watson equation (r = 0.65, p < 0.05). Anthropometric values were, on average, 4.8% higher. TBW measured by BIA at the end of treatment overestimated fluid losses induced by ultrafiltration by 14% to 70%, while TBW 6 h after dialysis reflected the weight losses. On line BIA during hemodialysis has a very low positive predictive value (41.6%) and poor sensitivity (66%) for the prediction of hypotension. In conclusion, BIA is helpful in assessing the urea distribution volume but is not reliable for assessing acute fluid changes nor for predicting hypotensive episodes related to hemodialysis."
CD009647,0,8808224,0,Dry skin (xerosis) in patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis: the role of decreased sweating of the eccrine sweat gland.,"The aetiology and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of dry skin in uraemia are still unclear, but the hydration status of stratum corneum clearly influences the appearance of skin. The xerotic skin texture is often referred to as 'dry skin' and has been suggested as a cause of uraemic pruritus. To understand the aetiology of dry skin in uraemia we measured the status of skin surface hydration of uraemic patients with the corneometer and skin surface hydrometer, the functional capacity and the urea concentration of stratum corneum and the response of eccrine sweat gland to sudorific agent (0.05% pilocarpine HCL) in 18 age-matched haemodialysis patients and 10 healthy volunteers. We also performed the water sorption-desorption test to uraemic and control subjects after application of urea in various concentrations. Uraemic patient's skin showed decreased water content compared to control subjects. However, we found no correlation between dry skin and pruritus. Although the urea concentration of the horny layer in uraemic patients was elevated compared to control subjects (28.2 microgram/cm2 vs 5.04 micrograms/cm2, P < 0.05), its moisturizing effect to relieve pruritus is questionable because its artificial application revealed no improvement of the functional capacity of horny layer in concentration 5 times higher than the physiological concentration. Uraemic patients showed decreased sweating response to sudorific agent. In conclusion, the functional abnormalities of eccrine sweat glands may be account for dry skin in uraemic patients at least in part, but there is no correlation between xerosis and pruritus."

CD009647,0,2227272,0,Multiple hormone elevations in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Prospective study of clinical significance and of the development of a second symptomatic pancreatic endocrine tumor syndrome.,"In the present study of 45 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, the frequency and clinical importance of the release of multiple gastrointestinal peptides were assessed prospectively. During an initial evaluation, extent of gastrinoma, clinical symptoms, disease duration, and presence or absence of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I (MEN-I) were assessed. All patients had determinations of fasting plasma gastrin, human pancreatic polypeptide, motilin, neurotensin, and somatostatin; 35 had determinations of insulin and gastrin-releasing peptide and 21 had determinations of glucagon. A plasma elevation of additional peptides besides gastrin was detected in 62%, with 44% having one, 18% having two, and 0% having three additional peptides elevated. Motilin was elevated in 29%, human pancreatic polypeptide in 27%, neurotensin in 20%, and gastrin-releasing peptide in 10%, whereas insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin were not elevated in any patient. The presence or absence of elevation of any peptide did not differ in patients with or without MEN-I, with gastrinoma size, with the presence or absence of metastatic disease, or with various clinical symptoms. Patients were assessed yearly for clinical evidence of a secondary symptomatic pancreatic endocrine tumor syndrome with a median follow-up of 146 and 84 months from onset or diagnosis, respectively. Only one patient (2% of patients) developed a second syndrome (rate, 2 patients per 100 patients observed for 10 years). These results demonstrate that the plasma elevation of multiple gastrointestinal peptides is common in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; however, the rate of developing a second symptomatic pancreatic endocrine tumor syndrome is much lower than generally believed. Furthermore, no evidence is found to support the conclusions that the detection of the plasma elevation of these peptides is clinically important in assessing MEN-I status, disease extent, or presence of metastatic disease or that elevated levels of motilin, neurotensin, gastrin-releasing peptide, or human pancreatic peptide are associated with any distinct clinical symptoms. Therefore, we recommend that plasma concentrations of these additional gastrointestinal peptides should not be assessed routinely but rather only if new symptoms develop."

The isotopic enrichments in urine and plasma sampled simultaneously 4 h post-DLW dose were compared in a subset of 281 subjects [139 women, 142 men, 75 +/- 3 (SD) yr] of the 3,075 participants in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study. Based on analytic precisions, a +/- 2% urine-plasma difference was set as the cut-off value. Ten percent of the population presented a difference lower than -2%, suggesting a delay in urine isotopic equilibration. This -13 +/- 10% urine-plasma difference was not linked to analytic errors, illnesses, the sampling time, or the time and quantity of water intake, suggesting that urine retention may be the main factor. The consequences are an 18 +/- 13 and 21 +/- 16% overestimation of the total body water and the TEE, respectively. Unexpectedly, 21% of the population presented a urine-plasma difference higher than +/- 2% that resulted, however, in a nonsignificant TEE underestimation of -3 +/- 5%. In conclusion, the delayed isotopic equilibration observed in urine reduces the accuracy of the DLW method in the elderly. It is recommended, when blood sampling is impossible, to adopt the intercept method with urine sampling 24 h postdose."

Nevertheless, the use of this therapy may lead to the risk of further aggravation of frequently coexisting renal dysfunction, especially when loop diuretics such as furosemide (FUR), torasemide etc. are administered at excessive doses leading to hypotension, hypoperfusion and/or relative dehydration in patients with decompensated CHF who could have benefit from intensive unloading therapy. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical and hematochemical markers which are able to predict a possible decline or rapid deterioration of renal function implying a rise in serum creatinine (Cr) >25% of its basal value, i.e. the so-called aggravated renal dysfunction (ARD), typically occurring during intensive unloading therapy with i.v.

All these patients had bone metastasis examined by either X-ray films or bone scintigram during clinical course of the disease and confirmed at the time of autopsy, thus an overall incidence of hypercalcemia in 149 patients with bone metastasis was 17.4%. Major clinical signs due to hypercalcemia were gastrointestinal symptoms such as anorexia, nausea and vomiting, renal dysfunction and neurological symptoms but there was no definitive correlation in between clinical signs and values of serum calcium. Among various treatments performed, a combination of hydration, steroids and calcitonin was the most effective. Mean survival time from the diagnosis of hypercalcemia was 288 + days for responders, and 28.8 days for non-responders (p less than 0.001). Seven patients expired due to hypercalcemia and were died suddenly, while others died of renal failures."

A Kaplan Meier survival curve with log rank test was calculated to determine incidence and time to occurrence of a HLE. Incidence of and time to a HLE did not differ between the treatment and control groups over an 8-week period (p > .05). However, treatment group participants were found to be more frail, more cognitively impaired and more at risk for acute confusion than the control group participants. Although there were no statistically significant differences between the groups, it is clinically significant that the frailer, more at-risk participants in the treatment group had a lower incidence of HLEs."
CD009647,0,1285991,0,[Pathogenesis of hyponatremia observed in the treatment of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage].,"The cause of hyponatremia following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been understood as an inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Whereas, water restriction for the management of this condition sometimes induces a severe dehydration, resulting in vasospasm. To clarify the pathogenesis of hyponatremia following SAH, we measured the daily sodium and water balance with the plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and plasma renin activity (PRA) in seventeen cases after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although the patients received an adequate amount of fluid (more than 4080ml/day; daily average in seventeen cases) and sodium (more than 277 mEq/day; daily average in seventeen cases), eight out of the seventeen cases showed transient hyponatremia of a slight degree beginning on 8.8 days after SAH. ANP values were elevated markedly in fifteen out of the seventeen cases, remaining high during the first two weeks following SAH. ADH values were elevated remarkably in eight out of the seventeen cases. However, these values declined immediately to a normal range within two days following SAH. PRA were increased or came within the normal range, suggesting the lack of water retention. Overall sodium balance and water balance did not differ significantly between hyponatremia cases and normonatremia ones, whereas, sodium balance in acute phase was significantly negative, associated with marked natriuresis in patients with hyponatremia. These correlations suggested that hyponatremia after SAH is the result of natriuresis by an increased ANP rather than ADH. In conclusion, a greater replenishment of water and sodium is required to avoid hyponatremia with dehydration. This technique may be helpful for the prevention of vasospasms following SAH."

CD009647,0,17987382,0,Pathways involved in the transition from hypertension to hypertrophy to heart failure. Treatment strategies.,"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is critical in regulating systemic blood pressure, water and electrolyte balance, and pituitary gland hormones. These physiologies appear to be primarily mediated by the angiotensin II/AT(1) receptor subtype system. Overstimulation of this system can predispose cardiovascular disease (CVD) characterized by excessive vasoconstriction, fibrosis, and cardiac remodeling. If untreated, the patient typically displays a continuum of pathophysiologic conditions progressing from atherosclerosis to left ventricle hypertrophy (LVH), coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarcts, with heart failure as an endpoint. Intervention with antihypertensive therapy is necessary to inhibit this progression. RAAS blocking drugs appear to be the most effective approach. Diastolic heart failure patients benefit from treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin AT(1) receptor blockers (ARBs). Elderly CVD patients evidence age-related changes in body composition that alter the distribution and half-life of medications, thus presenting special challenges to treatment. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, renal dysfunction, liver insufficiency further complicates any therapeutic strategy. In addition, noncompliance because of cognitive impairment, depression, confusion due to the complexity of dose regimens, and lack of an appropriate social support system can disrupt positive outcome. The present review discusses the roles of an overactive RAAS and sympathetic nervous system as primary contributors to CVD. In addition, treatment strategies are discussed, focusing on middle aged and elderly hypertensive and heart failure patients."
CD009647,0,17515726,0,Fluid dynamics during hemodialysis in relationship to sodium gradient between dialysate and plasma.,"Fluid shifts during hemodialysis involve changes in both extracellular and intracellular volumes. This study aimed to determine the effect of intradialytic sodium gradients (GNa), that is, the difference between dialysate and serum sodium concentration, on dynamics of extracellular and intracellular volumes in a group of maintenance hemodialysis patients. Extracellular volume change (deltaECV) between predialysis and postdialysis periods was determined by whole-body bioimpedance spectroscopy; intracellular volume change (deltaICV) was indirectly derived as the difference between deltaECV and the change in body weight, corrected for intradialytically given fluids. A total of 200 bioimpedance measurements were performed in 32 dialysis patients. Extracellular and intracellular volume changes were -2.6 +/- 0.9 L (range: -4.7 to -0.5 L) and -0.2 +/- 0.7 L (range: -2.5 to +1.5 L), respectively. There was a significant correlation between deltaICV and GNa; deltaICV = -0.12 * GNa + 0.26 (p < 0.001). In contrast, GNa was not correlated with deltaECV. We conclude that the sodium gradient between dialysate and plasma has a significant effect on the ICV during dialysis. Hemodialysis with GNa = 0 mmol/L should be sought to prevent ICV shrinking or swelling and to prevent excessive thirst, consequently high interdialytic weight gains, and ultrafiltration rates."

We describe the case of a 78-year-old woman with gradual onset of hypokalemia, watery diarrhea, and weight loss. After a left adrenal mass was discovered, the patient chose medical therapy over surgical intervention. Initially her condition responded, then gradually became refractory to medical therapy. She had elevated levels of VIP, pancreatic polypeptide, dopamine, and vanillylmandelic acid. Subsequently, the patient underwent surgical excision of the mass that was found to be a VIP-producing pheochromocytoma. After surgery her diarrhea subsided, and her electrolytes and affected neuroendocrine hormone levels normalized."

CD009647,0,1835074,0,[Whole body and thoracic impedance changes induced by cardiopulmonary bypass].,"Impedance is defined as resistance to alternating electrical current. It is inversely proportional to the volume of tissues traversed by the current. Cardiopulmonary bypass, as used in cardiac surgery, results in extravascular fluid overload manifested by a decrease in whole body and thoracic impedance. This non-invasive method has been used in 18 adult patients before, and in the days immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass for non-mitral cardiac surgery. Right and left thoracic impedances were reduced by 32 and 37 percent respectively during the first postoperative hour and returned to preoperative values after the second postoperative day. Whole body impedance was reduced by 14 percent in the first post-operative day, and this was accompanied by 17 percent and 16 percent decreases in the PaO2/PAO2 and PaO2/FIO2 ratios respectively. There was no correlation between impedance and these ratios which reflect pulmonary gases exchanges. Impedance appears to be a simple method to evaluate whole body and thoracic water contents, thereby providing guidance in post-cardiac surgery management."
CD009647,0,1392326,0,Hemodynamic changes after resection of thoracic duct for en bloc resection of esophageal cancer.,"An en bloc resection of esophageal cancer is one of the most radical forms of esophagectomy, and includes the resection of the thoracic duct, but a relatively high hospital mortality rate has been reported. There is very little knowledge on the pathophysiological changes after resection of the thoracic duct. We examined 24 patients who underwent en bloc resection. Some patients developed severe tachycardia or shock postoperatively which subsided after a massive infusion of plasma. Analysis of the fluid balance revealed that much more fluid was necessary during surgery and the postoperative 24 h than in patients treated by a standard esophagectomy. Postoperative lymphangiography or CT revealed abnormal collateral lymphatics around the kidneys or in the pelvic cavity. This suggests the development of the lymphaticovenous shunts, which differed depending on the anatomy of each patient. One patient with chronic hepatitis developed uncontrollable ascites. These are important findings which can hopefully reduce the high rate of hospital death after this operation."

CD009647,0,7585758,0,Successful treatment of hyponatremia with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure.,"Hyponatremia commonly complicates the clinical course of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and seems to be an ominous prognostic factor. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve the symptomatology of CHF patients. Moreover, it has been reported that these drugs can raise serum sodium in hyponatremic patients. The aim of this prospective work was to study the mechanisms involved in the correction of hyponatremia in 6 patients aged 52-69 years with CHF and hyponatremia (serum sodium 125-128 mmol/l) who were receiving digitalis and furosemide. In these patients, captopril was introduced in progressively increasing doses. The drug induced significant clinical improvement. Additionally, a statistically significant increase in serum sodium was observed which was correlated to a rise in the diluting ability of the kidney (increase in CeH2O). A slight increase in creatinine clearance was also found, which could have contributed to the improvement in hyponatremia. Therefore, we conclude that ACE inhibitors can improve hyponatremia in CHF patients by increasing the urinary diluting ability."
CD009647,0,12411756,0,A randomized prospective trial to assess the role of saline hydration on the development of contrast nephrotoxicity.,"Though simple and attractive, the role of hydration for the prophylaxis of contrast nephrotoxicity has not been definitively established. We prospectively evaluated the role of deliberate saline hydration in patients undergoing nonemergency cardiac catheterization. Patients (n = 53) were randomized on the day prior to scheduled catheterization to one of two groups - group 1 (n = 27) received normal saline for 24 h (at a rate of 1 ml/kg/h) beginning 12 h prior to scheduled catheterization, and group 2 (n = 26) were allowed unrestricted oral fluids. Serum creatinine measured 24 and 48 h postcardiac catheterization was compared to the pre-randomization baseline value. The mean baseline calculated creatinine clearance was 79.6 +/- 31.9 ml/min and the mean baseline creatinine was 106 +/- 28 micromol/l. An increase in serum creatinine by at least 44.2 micromol/l (0.5 mg/dl), within 48 h of contrast exposure, was considered to represent clinically significant acute renal insufficiency. Ten subjects (18.9%) developed acute renal insufficiency. The incidence of acute renal insufficiency was significantly lower in group 1 (1 out of 27) as compared to group 2 (9 out of 26; p = 0.005 for comparison between groups; relative risk 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.015 to 0.79). Twenty-four hours after contrast exposure, the mean increase in creatinine was less in group 1 vs. group 2 (8 +/- 11 vs. 20 +/- 21 micromol/l, p = 0.02). The increase in creatinine was not significantly different in group 1 vs. group 2 48 h after contrast exposure (12 +/- 21 vs. 29 +/- 40 micromol/l, p = 0.17). Deliberate saline hydration decreases the incidence of contrast-related acute renal failure and the severity of contrast-induced renal dysfunction in patients undergoing non-emergency cardiac catheterization."
CD009647,0,11762791,0,Cystine analyses of separate day and night urine as a basis for the management of patients with homozygous cystinuria.,"Based on previous observations of the diurnal variation of urinary cystine excretion, the use of separate day and night urine collections was proposed. To improve the medical treatment of patients with cystinuria, this strategy was performed to guide the fluid intake and the administration of SH compounds (tiopronin, D-penicillamine, and MESNA).Twenty-six patients (19 treated with SH compounds and seven with alkalinization and hydration only) were followed during two 3.5-year periods. During Period 1, 24-h urine was collected and during Period 2, separate day and night urine was collected. There were 56 episodes of high urinary cystine supersaturation (> 1,200 micromol/l) during Period 2, 47% of which would have evaded detection with 24-h urine analysis. In comparison with Period 1, the urinary cystine concentration was lower (P < 0.05), and the urinary volume was higher (P < 0.05) during Period 2. Patients treated with tiopronin had reduced cystine excretion (P < 0.05) and at the end of Period 2, an increased dose of tiopronin, reflecting a more aggressive treatment. Furthermore, a reduced number of stone episodes and need of active stone removal (P < 0.05) was noted in the whole group of patients. Analyses of separate day and night urine samples can be used advantageously to reveal episodes of high supersaturation with cystine not detected in 24-h urine samples. Such a procedure might be useful for optimizing the treatment of patients with cystinuria."
CD009647,0,11762790,0,A comparison of the effects of potassium citrate and sodium bicarbonate in the alkalinization of urine in homozygous cystinuria.,"For many years, urine alkalinization has been one of the cornerstones in the treatment of homozygous cystinuria. Because of the relationship found between the excretion of urinary sodium and cystine, potassium citrate has emerged as the preferred sodium-free alkalizing agent. To evaluate the usefulness of potassium citrate for urine alkalization in cystinuric patients, sodium bicarbonate and potassium citrate were compared in 14 patients (10 on tiopronin treatment and four without treatment with sulfhydryl compounds). The study started with 1 week without the use of any alkalizing agents (Period 0) followed by 2 weeks with sodium bicarbonate (Period 1) and 2 weeks with potassium citrate (Period 2). Urinary pH, volume, excretion of sodium, potassium, citrate and free cystine, as well as the plasma potassium concentration, were recorded. Potassium citrate was shown to be effective as an alkalizing agent and, in this respect, not significantly different from sodium bicarbonate. Even though a normal diet was used, a significant increase in urinary sodium excretion was observed with sodium bicarbonate (Period 1). Urinary potassium and citrate excretion increased with potassium citrate (Period 2). A significant correlation was found between urinary sodium and cystine in the tio-pronin-treated patients. No significant differences in cystine excretion were recorded in Periods 0, 1 and 2. Plasma potassium was significantly higher during Period 2, but only one patient developed a mild hyperkalemia (5.0 mmol/l). The use of potassium citrate for urine alkalization in homozygous cystinuria is effective and can be recommended in the absence of severe renal impairment."

CD009647,0,1832071,0,Disturbance in sodium regulating hormones in chronic obstructive uropathy.,"Serum atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone levels have been studied in patients with chronic bilateral ureteric obstruction resulting from high pressure chronic retention of urine (HPCR), both in the obstructed state and during the post-obstructed period. Increased ANP levels observed during chronic obstruction fell rapidly following urinary tract decompression by urethral catheterisation. Serum ANP resurged briefly within 24 h but stabilised thereafter at a lower level. PRA was initially suppressed but rose after catheterisation, the increase lagging behind the changes seen for ANP. Rising levels of AII and aldosterone followed this trend but, unlike PRA, levels were not completely suppressed in the obstructed state. The observed hormonal changes probably reflect homeostatic mechanisms directed to the maintenance of sodium and water balance during obstruction and to limitation of the diuresis following its relief."

CD009647,0,4726136,0,Hypotension in tetanus.,"Three patients with severe tetanus had episodes of profound arterial hypotension lasting from minutes to hours. The blood pressure was recorded continuously for 13, 19, and six days respectively by an intra-arterial catheter, and other measurements included heart rate, central venous pressure, cardiac output, and blood gases.The hypotension was distinguished from that of ""shock"", for there was no clinical evidence of peripheral vasoconstriction and no tachycardia. It could not be attributed to disturbances of salt and water balance. During episodes of hypotension the blood pressure fell as low as 32/16 mm Hg, the heart rate fell from a mild tachycardia to normal values or a mild bradycardia, and the central venous pressure did not rise. The onset and the end of such episodes was often abrupt and the hypotension was often produced in response to a stimulus. In one patient extreme hypotension followed the aspiration of secretions from the trachea. These changes may represent another effect of tetanus on autonomic nervous activity, including impairment of baroreceptor reflexes."

This observational longitudinal cohort study recruited 43 people aged 60 years or over, voluntarily admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital's Geriatric and Rehabilitation Unit (GARU). Over 40 clinical, hematological and urinary biochemical parameters employed by medical officers during dehydration assessment, identified through literature, interviews and focus group were investigated. Short-term weight changes, intra- and inter-rater repeatability of dehydration assessments were completed to assess validation and precision of the clinician's clinical dehydration assessment. Systolic blood pressure drop on standing, sternal skin turgor, tongue dryness and body mass index (BMI) were associated with hydration status; demonstrated clinically meaningful differences between groups. BMI negatively confounded the association between dehydration and systolic blood pressure drop on standing. Physical, rather than biochemical, parameters more often identified mild dehydration. The findings challenge common expectations of hematological and physiological measurement changes occurring in older people clinically assessed as dehydrated and emphasize the need to adjust for potential confounders during exploration of the associations of clinical parameters with dehydration status."
CD009647,0,9572833,0,Analytic assessment of the various bioimpedance methods used to estimate body water.,"Knowledge of patient fluid distribution would be useful clinically. Both single-frequency (SF) and impedance modeling approaches are proposed. The high intercorrelation between body water compartments makes determining the best approach difficult. This study was conducted to evaluate the merits of an SF approach. Mathematical simulation was performed to determine the effect of tissue change on resistance and reactance. Dilution results were reanalyzed, and resistance and parallel reactance were used to predict the intracellular water for two groups. Results indicated that the amount of intracellular and extracellular water conduction at any SF can vary with tissue change, and reactance at any SF is affected by all tissue parameters. Modeling provided a good prediction of dilution intracellular and extracellular water, but an SF method did not. Intracellular, extracellular, and total body water were equally predicted at all frequencies by SF resistance and parallel reactance. Extracellular and intracellular water are best measured through modeling, because only at the zero and infinite frequencies are the results sensitive only to extracellular and intracellular water. At all other frequencies there are other effects."
CD009647,0,7056850,0,Age-related failure of volume-pressure-mediated vasopressin release.,"Osmoreceptor sensitivity, as estimated by the plasma vasopressin (AVP) response to hypertonic saline infusion, increases with age. We studied volume-pressure sensitivity, as estimated by the plasma AVP response to orthostasis, in healthy young (19-31 yr old; n = 12) and old (62-80 yr old; n = 15) subjects. After remaining recumbent overnight (minimum of 8 h), subjects stood quietly for 8 min. Cardiovascular changes on standing were not influenced by age. The peak plasma AVP response was greater in the young than in the old (P = 0.02, by rank sum test). When categorized as responders (peak AVP response, greater than or equal to 3 pg/ml) or nonresponders (peak response, less than 3 pg/ml), the young group included 11 responders and 1 nonresponder, while the old group included 8 responders and 7 nonresponders (P = 0.03, by Fisher exact test). There was no difference in the marked increase in plasma norepinephrine on standing between old responders (n = 6) and old nonresponders (n = 4). These studies indicate that failure to release AVP in response to orthostasis is more common in the elderly than in the young. The intact norepinephrine response to orthostatis in the elderly, regardless of the AVP response, suggests that the age-related defect is distal to the vasomotor center in the afferent limb of the baroreceptor reflex arc. Insensitivity to the volume and pressure changes accompanying hypertonic saline infusion may contribute to the previously noted augmented AVP response of the elderly to hyperosmolality."

CD009647,0,11095656,0,Effect of dialysate sodium concentration on interdialytic increase of potassium.,"To evaluate the role of plasma tonicity in the postdialysis increment of plasma potassium (p[K(+)]), the outcome of two hemodiafiltration treatments that differed only in the Na(+) level in dialysate (Na(D))-143 mmol/L (high dialysate sodium concentration [H-Na(D)]) and 138 mmol/L (low dialysate sodium concentration [L-Na(D)])-were compared in the same group of uremic patients from the end of treatment (T0) to the subsequent 30 to 120 min and up to 68 h. Kt/V and intradialytic K(+) removal were comparable. At T0, plasma [Na(+)] was 145+/-1 and 137+/-1 mmol/L after H-Na(D) and L-Na(D), respectively (P<0.001). The difference in plasma tonicity persisted from T0 to T68 h. At T120, p[K(+)] was increased from the T0 value of 3.7+/-0.2 to 4.7+/-0.2 mmol/L (P<0.05) after H-Na(D), whereas it was unchanged after L-Na(D). The change of p[K(+)] was still different after 68 h (+76+/-10% and +50+/-7% in H-Na(D) and L-Na(D), respectively; P<0.05). Of note, in the first 2 h after the end of treatment, bioimpedance analysis revealed only in H-Na(D) a significant 11+/-3% decrement of phase angle that is compatible with a decrease of intracellular fluid volume at the expense of the extracellular volume. Similarly, within the same time frame, in H-Na(D), a significant reduction of mean corpuscular volume of red cells, associated with a 2 +/-1% decrease of the intracellular [K(+)], was observed. In contrast, mean corpuscular volume of red cells did not change and erythrocyte [K(+)] increased by 6+/-1% after L-Na(D) (P<0.005 versus H-Na(D)). Thus, hypertonicity significantly contributes to the increase of p[K(+)] throughout the whole interdialytic period by determining intracellular fluid volume/extracellular volume redistribution of water and K(+)."
CD009647,0,22265393,0,Metabolic alkalosis from unsuspected ingestion: use of urine pH and anion gap.,"Underlying causes of metabolic alkalosis may be evident from history, evaluation of effective circulatory volume, and measurement of urine chloride concentration. However, identification of causes may be difficult for certain conditions associated with clandestine behaviors, such as surreptitious vomiting, use of drugs or herbal supplements with mineralocorticoid activity, abuse of laxatives or diuretics, and long-term use of alkalis. In these circumstances, clinicians often are bewildered by unexplained metabolic alkalosis from an incomplete history or persistent deception by the patient, leading to misdiagnosis and poor outcome. We present a case of severe metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia with a borderline urine chloride concentration in an alcoholic patient treated with a thiazide. The cause of the patient's metabolic alkalosis eventually was linked to surreptitious ingestion of baking soda. This case highlights the necessity of a high index of suspicion for the diverse clandestine behaviors that can cause metabolic alkalosis and the usefulness of urine pH and anion gap in its differential diagnosis."

CD009647,0,8991388,0,[Critical illness polyneuropathy].,"Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is a recently identified entity for which reliable data is unavailable and of which the prevalence is unknown. Although the percentage of patients suffering CIP is low, more cases, including subclinical ones, are likely to be detected through the use of electroneurography. Any aged patient may be affected by CIP. It usually occurs a long stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is generally associated with sepsis, severe trauma and so-called multiple organ failure. The main clinical sign is distal weakness in the lower extremeties, although finding one or more of the following signs is not uncommon: quadriparesis, quadriplegia, difficult weaning, loss of osteo-tendon reflexes and muscle atrophy. The pathophysiology of CIP is unknown, although such mechanisms as cell dehydration, increased proteolysis and the activation of certain cytokins have been suggested. Before diagnosing CIP, other neuromuscle diseases and several recently described toxic myopathies must be ruled out. Electroneuromyographic study of axonal lesions may be of great utility, whereas analyses have low specificity. Histologic examination, when possible, allows axonal lesions (but never demyelinization) to be observed along with the non specific changes of myopathy. Although no specific treatment is available, the long-term prognosis is good if the underlying disease that gave rise to ICU admission is controlled, and if rehabilitation therapy is started early."

CD009647,0,7671647,0,Prevention and treatment of traveler's diarrhea: a clinical pharmacological approach.,"Diarrhea represents a major health problem for travelers to developing countries. Although the syndrome is usually self-limited and recovery occurs in the majority of cases without any specific form of therapy, there is a need for safe and effective ways of preventing and treating it. Since the syndrome is most often caused by an infection acquired by ingesting fecally contaminated food or beverages, precautions regarding dietary habits remain the cornerstone of prophylaxis, but dietary self-restrictions do not always translate to reduced rates of diarrheal illness. Administration of probiotics (e.g. lactobacilli or Saccharomyces boulardii) and immunoprophylaxis with the newer oral cholera vaccines have been tried with promising results. Antimicrobials remain, however, the most successful form of prophylaxis, being effective in up to 90% of travelers. For those with impaired health who will take prophylaxis, systemic agents with proved efficacy should be recommended. For other otherwise healthy persons, poorly absorbed agents are preferable in order to avoid the serious, albeit rare, toxicity of systemic drugs. The key factor in the management of acute watery traveler's diarrhea, particularly in infants and young children, is the restoration of water and electrolyte balance. This does not reduce the duration of the illness but will limit dehydration and prevent acidosis. Many patients will require no additional therapy, whereas some will need pharmacologic treatment to shorten the duration of diarrhea or to relieve the accompanying symptoms, like abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting. A typical 3- to 5-day illness can be reduced to approximately 1 day by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) combination. Some other systemic antimicrobials have been successfully used but, during the last few years, the 4-fluoroquinolone drugs have received considerable attention and have been shown to be highly effective in reducing the duration of traveler's diarrhea. These antimicrobials may become the best option for adults. The safest choice remains the use of poorly absorbed antimicrobials. Unfortunately, however, only a few compounds (i.e. bicozamycin and furazolidone) have been specifically tested in the therapy of traveler's diarrhea. Others (e.g. nifuroxazide or rifaximin), which have been found effective in various homeland forms of infective diarrhea deserve to be evaluated in specifically designed clinical trials. Persons visiting developing countries where the risk of traveler's diarrhea is high should be recommended to bring an antidiarrheal compound or bismuth subsalycilate, if available, and an antibacterial agent. For infants, children and the elderly, in whom dehydration may occur rapidly and be particularly dangerous, oral rehydration solutions are indicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,8453184,0,Treatment recommendations for respiratory tract infections associated with aging.,"Age-related changes, for example reduced elasticity and earlier airways collapse, predispose the elderly to respiratory infection. Other factors such as a lifetime of smoking, the use of hypnotics, or the development of stroke also predispose. Pneumonia becomes increasingly common with advancing age, and both morbidity and mortality increase with associated disease burden. Diagnosis of pneumonia may be more difficult in the aged because of physiological changes. However, careful physical examination with accurate, regular recording of body temperature will usually reveal the characteristic features of pneumonia, which should be confirmed by chest radiograph. In the frail elderly, the onset of impaired function, such as confusion, immobility, falling or incontinence, should raise suspicion of infection. Pneumonia is classified as community-acquired, nursing home-acquired or nosocomial, which helps in the empirical choice of antibiotics. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common organism in the community, then Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Gram-negative organisms like Klebsiella and Escherichia coli are more common in nosocomial infections. Nursing home patients with pneumonia tend to be more frail than those in the community. Treatment is directed at eradication of the organism with the appropriate antibiotic, maintaining hydration and oxygenation, as well as managing impaired mobility, faecal loading, urinary incontinence and confusion. Influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for the frail elderly. Tuberculosis remains an important diagnosis in the frail elderly and should always be considered, especially in patients with respiratory infection who fail to respond to conventional therapy."
CD009647,0,21519727,0,[Importance of water in the hydration of the Spanish population: FESNAD 2010 document].,"For any healthy individual, thirst is an appropriate sign to drink water, except for babies, sportsmen, and most of ill and elderly people. In these instances, it is convenient to schedule appropriate times to drink water since great demands and the physiological mechanisms that determine thirst in these situations may condition water unbalances with important consequences for health and the physical and intellectual performance. The human body has a number of mechanisms that allow keeping constant the water content by adjusting intakes and wastes. Water balance is determined by intake (consumed water, beverages, and water contained in foods) and wastes (urine, stools, the skin, and expired air from the lungs). Failure of these mechanisms and subsequent impairments in water balance may produce severe disarrangements that may threaten somebody's life. In the present document, we analyze the evidences regarding the factors conditioning water needs in the different life stages and physiological situations, as well as the consequences of water unbalance under different situations. A proper hydration may be achieved by feeding and the use of water and other liquids. Although water is the beverage by excellence and represents the ideal way of restoring the losses and get hydrated, we should be aware that, from the very beginning, we have sought other liquid sources with hydration properties. In the last decades we have increased the consumption of different beverages, with a proliferation of sugar-containing beverages. Since excessive sugar consumption has been related to obesity and other chronic conditions, it is evident that the use of these caloric beverages should be rationalized, especially in children. In this document all the considerations regarding hydration are presented and different recommendations are exposed."

Body weight (BW) was greater in normal males than in normal females. Percent body fat (BF/BW) was greater in females than in males and was increased with age in both sexes. Percent total body water (TBW/BW) was less in females than in males. Although percent extracellular water (ECW/BW) was not different between both sexes, the ECW/TBW ratio was greater in females than in males. Percent body cell mass (BCM/BW) was lower in females than in males. The patients with acromegaly had a lower percent BF but a higher percent TBW, percent ECW and ECW/TBW ratio than normal subjects, while the patients with GH deficiency had a higher percent BF and ECW/TBW ratio, but lower percent TBW. Percent body cell mass (BCM/BW) was higher in acromegaly and lower in GH deficiency than in normals. There was a negative correlation (r = -0.62) between plasma IGF-I levels and percent BF, whereas a positive correlation (r = 0.51) was found between the plasma IGF-I level and percent BCM. It is suggested, therefore, that body composition is affected by sex and age in normals, and by GH secretion in patients with pituitary dysfunction. Plasma IGF-I levels may be one of the factors responsible for alterations in body composition."
CD009647,0,20567873,0,Voriconazole-associated salt-losing nephropathy.,"A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and steroid therapy was initiated. Subsequently, he was affected by deep mycosis, and hence, voriconazole (VRCZ) was administered. On the 16th day, he was transferred to our hospital because of somnolence and malaise. His systolic blood pressure was approximately 80 mmHg, and he showed decreased skin turgor, indicating volume depletion. Laboratory analysis revealed hyponatremia and liver dysfunction. Discontinuation of VRCZ and drip infusion of normal saline improved the consciousness disorder, hyponatremia, and liver dysfunction. The levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and plasma renin activity were elevated. This patient showed high excreted urine sodium, despite volume depletion and low serum osmolality. Therefore, this patient was diagnosed with salt-losing nephropathy (SLN). SLN should be considered for treatment of VRCZ-associated hyponatremia, together with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH."

It was established that all forms of ischaemic heart disease are accompanied by a significant potassium deficit imperceptible for blood and urine examinations of their electrolyte composition. The potassium deficit is most clearly expressed in patients with cardiosclerosis, especially in congestive heart failure. In a considerable part of the patients with acute myocardial infarction, including those without clinical signs of congestive heart failure, the rate of sodium and water metabolism is decreased, and the total body content of metabolizing sodium is increased. Sodium retention in the body is especially severe in patients with cardiosclerosis complicated by congestive circulatory insufficiency. The administration of diuretics in adequate doses was shown to result in normalization of the indices of sodium and water metabolism."

CD009647,0,19822077,0,Release of palladium from biomechanical prostheses in body fluids can induce or support PD-specific IFNgamma T cell responses and the clinical setting of a palladium hypersensitivity.,"The increased use of Palladium (Pd) for biomedical applications, which has more than doubled in the last ten years, appears to be associated with an increased frequency of adverse reactions to Pd. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the implant of a biomechanical apparatus containing Pd and the setting of a hypersensitivity to Pd by determining the levels of the metal released in biological fluids, assessing the effects of Pd on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytokine production and exploring the clinical setting of skin sensitization. Of a total of 3,093 subjects examined in 2006, sensitization to Pd alone or in association with nickel (Ni) was observed in 1.6% and 13.03% of the individuals, respectively. Of these, a group of six subjects positive to Pd and negative to Ni at patch testing were selected on the basis of the oral clinical symptoms in order to measure both the levels of Pd in biological fluids and the degradation of the dental prostheses. Specific Pd measurements were carried out on salivary fluid, urine and serum samples by High Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. In addition, the degradation of the dental prostheses was assessed by both a leaching test and an analysis of the micro morphology of orthodontic prostheses. The induction of IFN-gamma production by Pd was assessed in PBMC by the ELISpot assay. Skin sensitization to Pd was evaluated by patch testing and clinical examination. Ten healthy subjects were comparatively tested as controls. We found a specific induction of an IFN-gamma response by Pd in PBMC collected from all the subjects positive to Pd at patch testing. On the contrary, control subjects did not show any response to Pd as assessed by IFN-gamma ELISpot assay or by skin testing. Remarkably, the levels of Pd in all biological samples (saliva, sera, urine) were significantly higher in Pd-sensitized patients than in those collected from controls, reaching the highest concentrations in the urine. The leaching studies gave additional evidence that the dental appliances can release measurable levels of Pd in saliva. Oral clinical symptoms in patients with Pd dental prostheses were associated with measurable levels of Pd in the biological fluids, the induction of Pd-specific IFN-gamma responses in PBMC and the clinical evidence of skin sensitization to Pd. These data suggest that dental appliances may represent an active source of Pd in the body, and this, in turn, can favour the clinical setting of a hypersensitivity to this metal."
CD009647,0,11724647,0,Mechanisms underlying the impairment in orthostatic tolerance after nocturnal recumbency in patients with autonomic failure.,"In the present study, we have assessed in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension the haemodynamics underlying the reduced tolerance to standing after prolonged recumbency at night. In 10 patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (age 33-68 years), of which seven were being treated with fludrocortisone and/or sleeping in the 12 degrees head-up tilt position, 24 h continuous non-invasive finger blood pressure was recorded by a Portapres device. Beat-to-beat blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and total peripheral vascular resistance obtained by pulse contour analysis were assessed during 5 min of standing in the evening (at 22.30 hours) and in the morning (at 06.30 hours). On average, the inverse of the normal 24 h blood pressure profile was found, with a large diversity in blood pressure profiles among patients. Supine blood pressure values were similar, but standing blood pressure values were lower in the morning than in the evening (P<0.01). This resulted from larger falls in stroke volume and cardiac output upon standing in the morning compared with the evening, while total peripheral resistance did not change. There was no relationship between the decrease in body weight during the night (mean 0.9 kg; range 0.2-1.6 kg) and the evening-morning difference in standing blood pressure. We conclude that, in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, the impaired tolerance to standing in the morning is due to larger falls in stroke volume and cardiac output. Not only nocturnal polyuria, but also a redistribution of body fluid, are likely mechanisms underlying the pronounced decreases in stroke volume and cardiac output after prolonged recumbency at night."

We examined 53 patients postoperatively, after abdominal operations and within the framework of the diagnosis of ileus, to find out whether there were any problems with the fluid and electrolyte balance, and whether side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, pain and diarrhoea were still tolerable. The patients did not classify their subjective complaints as very serious. None of our patients showed clinically manifest disorders of the fluid and electrolyte balance. The increased frequency of bowel movement, caused by the contrast agent, was required for the treatment of postoperative bowel atonia and the condition of ileus or sub-ileus, if present. We still think the application of hyperosmolar contrast media can be justified, and hence we restrict the use of the much more expensive iso-osmolar contrast agents to patients who are at risk in respect to aspiration and unfit to cooperate."

Forty-six patients with diagnosis of ureteral stone, based on imaging findings in computed tomography were enrolled in this study. The gray-scale ultrasound exam from both kidneys and urinary bladder was performed. Then, ureterovesical jet characteristics including ureteral jet frequency, duration and peak velocity were assessed by color Doppler and duplex Doppler studies in both obstructed and unobstructed ureters by a radiologist, 15-30 min after oral hydration with 750-1,000 mL of water. When compared with contralateral normal side, the ureterovesical jet in obstructed ureter showed less frequency (0.59 vs. 3.04 jets/min; P < 0.05), shorter duration (1.24 vs. 5.26 s; P < 0.05) and lower peak velocity (5.41 vs. 32.09 cm/s; P < 0.05). The cut-off points of 1.5 jets/min, 2.5 s and 19.5 cm/s for difference of ureteral jet frequency, duration and peak velocity between obstructed and contralateral normal ureters yielded sensitivities of 97.8, 95.6 and 100 % and specificities of 87, 87.9 and 97.8 %, respectively for diagnosis of ureteral obstruction. Given the safety of Doppler study and significant differences in flow dynamics of obstructed versus unobstructed ureters, our findings demonstrated the utility of Doppler ultrasound examination as a useful adjunct to gray-scale ultrasound by improving the accuracy of ultrasound exam in diagnosis of ureteral obstruction."
CD009647,0,18540689,0,Tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: issues relevant to the elderly.,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) continue to be the first-choice antidepressant treatment for the elderly as they have similar efficacy to other antidepressants but better tolerability. However, recent concerns have emerged regarding a range of adverse effects that are more likely to occur in the elderly. In part this relates to the increased risk of drug interactions. Platelet dysfunction induced by SSRIs with high serotenergic activity is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in the first month of treatment, although the overall evidence is weak. The risk of falls and fractures in elderly patients taking SSRIs is similar to that reported with use of tricyclic antidepressants. Hyponatraemia due to induction of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion may be life threatening in the elderly but in most cases is asymptomatic and reversible. Extrapyramidal disorders such as parkinsonism and dyskinesias are more common in the elderly but are rare. There is a very low risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients taking SSRIs. There are inconsistent findings linking SSRIs with suicidal behaviour in late life and with the risk of cancer. Most of the newly identified adverse effects are either relatively uncommon or of debatable significance. Few differences have been identified among the SSRIs that are of clinical significance. However, it is recommended in the elderly that SSRIs should be titrated slowly to recommended therapeutic doses and used cautiously with other agents known to have the potential for drug interactions."
CD009647,0,17309574,0,A novel method for dry weight assessment in hemodialysis patients: utilization of inferior vena cava flat ratio to correct for individual variations in vessel diameter.,"Measurement of the inferior of vena cava (IVC) diameter by ultrasonography (US) has been shown to be useful for assessing dry weight (DW) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We have previously observed some cases in which the IVC diameter differed depending on whether measurements were obtained from sagittal or cross-sectional images. Thus, in the present study we introduce a new concept, the flat ratio, to define the magnitude of IVC deflation. The flat ratio of the IVC (F-IVC) is determined from cross-sectional ultrasonographic images of the IVC. The present study showed that F-IVC is significantly correlated with changes in body weight (DeltaBW(%)). Similarly, the change in F-IVC (DeltaF-IVC) during HD is correlated with DeltaBW(%) but not with changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure during HD. The results of the present study suggest that F-IVC measurement can serve as a useful tool for DW assessment."

Increases in LVSWI of 43% to 68% over baseline in HES patients compared favorably to 15-22% increases in ALB patients. The cardiopulmonary variables at 12 and 24 h were comparable in both groups. Improvement in cardiac function was also reflected by better tissue perfusion as judged by reduction in arterial lactate from 2.9 to 1.5 mM/L (ALB) and 2.6 to 1.4 mM/L (HES). Increased O2 delivery and reduced O2 extraction without significant deterioration of PaO2 or alveolar-arterial O2 gradient were observed with stabilization of circulation. Clinical bleeding due to colloid resuscitation was not documented and renal function was not affected significantly by either fluid. It seems that HES may offer a cost-effective alternative to ALB for patients requiring colloid resuscitation."

CD009647,0,20979951,0,"Pseudoaldosteronism with increased serum cortisol associated with pneumonia, hypouricemia, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia.","We describe here the interesting case of a 73-year-old hypertensive man with pseudoaldosteronism. He had been taking glycyrrhizin at a dose of 75 mg/day for 12 years because of mild liver damage, but had never experienced any previous symptoms associated with hypokalemia. He was referred to our hospital because of hypokalemic tetraparesis and rhabdomyolysis. At that time, we noted mineralocorticoid excess characterized by hypokalemia due to urinary K loss, exacerbation of hypertension due to increased tubular Na reabsorption, metabolic alkalosis, and suppression of both plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration. His urinary free cortisol excretion rate and the urinary ratio of free cortisol to free cortisone were markedly elevated. Thus we diagnosed pseudoaldosteronism that was related to the long-term use of glycyrrhizin. When he developed pseudoaldosteronism, he also contracted pneumonia, and exhibited elevated levels of serum cortisol and creatinine clearance (CCr) as well as hypouricemia, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. All normalized after the recovery from pneumonia and the administration of spironolactone. The extracellular volume expansion associated with increased tubular Na reabsorption by the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron and the resulting increase in CCr caused an inhibition of proximal tubular reabsorption of uric acid, Ca, and inorganic phosphate, leading to their renal loss and therefore hypouricemia, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia, respectively. In this patient, the increased circulating cortisol associated with the stress of inflammation caused by pneumonia triggered the development of pseudoaldosteronism."
CD009647,0,538,0,Effect on aging on plasma renin and aldosterone in normal man.,"The influence of aging on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was evaluated by comparing young (20 to 30 yr) with elderly (62 to 70 yr) healthy subjects. Despite comparable body sodium-fluid balance in the two age groups, serum renin concentration, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were lower in the elderly. The age-related decreases in circulating renin and aldosterone concentrations were slight while subjects were supine and receiving normal sodium intake; when upright and during sodium depletion, they were more pronounced. Inverse renin-blood pressure interrelations were noted during two of four study conditions involving normal sodium intake or mild sodium depletion (r = --0.44 and --0.47, respectively), but not during progressive sodium depletion. Plasma renin levels were decreased in the elderly regardless of the presence or absence of an inverse relationship with blood pressure. Aldosterone and cortisol responses to corticotropin infusion were unaltered in the elderly. It is concluded that aging may cause a decrease in circulating renin, with parallel lowering of plasma aldosterone concentrations."
CD009647,0,7592179,0,Antibiotic prophylaxis in cardiac surgery: factors associated with potentially toxic serum concentrations of gentamicin.,"Aminoglycosides are commonly used with flucloxacillin in the prevention of wound infection and endocarditis after cardiac surgery. Earlier studies suggested that the use of aminoglycosides is associated with a small but significant rise in serum creatinine. A regression analysis was performed to identify the preoperative and postoperative factors of importance in determining serum gentamicin concentrations. Serum assays might then be confined to those at particular risk of elevated serum levels. Patients received gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg at the start of surgery followed by 80 mg tds for two days in addition to flucloxacillin. Trough and peak serum gentamicin concentrations were assayed on the first and second days after surgery and urine concentrations were measured with each full catheter bag. Patient characteristics, drug therapy, operation, fluid balance and routine investigations were recorded. A total of 95 of 104 patients were evaluable. Linear discriminant analysis of factors selected by forward stepwise regression identified ten of the 15 patients with subsequent elevated gentamicin concentrations, by using age, and preoperative serum creatinine, systolic blood pressure and serum aspartate transaminase. After operation, factors such as serum creatinine, the quantity of frusemide administered in 24 h, and the integral of the systolic blood pressure over 24 h identified 12 of the 15 patients. However, no satisfactory model could predict urinary concentrations. The discriminant function using preoperative factors prospectively identified 11 of 12 patients with elevated trough levels from a total of 101 further patients. Postoperative gentamicin concentrations cannot reliably be predicted from patient characteristics. Trough assays should be performed or prophylactic courses limited to 24 h."

CD009647,0,19885790,0,[Vasopressin receptor antagonists and heart failure].,"Vasopressin plays a physiological role in regulation of blood pressure, fluid volume, and serum osmolality. In heart failure inadequate release of vasopressin may result in excess fluid retention and hyponatremia. Vasopressin receptor antagonists are a new class of orally active drugs targeted to inhibit one or more of three distinct vasopressin receptors, namely V1a- (-->vasoconstriction), V1b- (-->release of ACTH) und V2-receptors (-->inhibition of free water reabsorption in the kidney). In cardiac decompensation with fluid overload selective V2- (Lixivaptan, satavaptan and tolvaptan) and non-selective V1a/V2-receptor blockers (Conivaptan) have been shown to be superior to standard therapy, as they allow for a faster weight loss and a more rapid symptomatic improvement (i.e. reduction in dyspnea). Inhibiting free water reabsorption without affecting renal sodium excretion vasopressin receptor antagonists allow for a controlled normalisation of serum natrium in euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Vasopressin antagonists are well tolerated and have--in contrast to diuretics--no negative influence on renal function and serum potassium. Heart rate and blood pressure are not affected by vasopressin receptor antagonists. However, despite its excellent acute clinical effects long-term treatment with tolvaptan did not result in a reduced mortality and morbidity in heart failure patients over a mean follow-up of 9.9 months in the EVEREST trial."
CD009647,0,21550084,0,Resting energy expenditure and protein turnover are increased in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"The mechanisms leading to weight loss in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are poorly understood. Changes in protein metabolism and systemic inflammation may contribute to increased resting energy expenditure (REE) in COPD, leading to an energy imbalance and loss of fat and fat-free mass. The objective of this study was to determine first whether REE was increased in patients with COPD and, second, whether this was associated with increased protein turnover and/or systemic inflammation. Resting energy expenditure was determined using indirect calorimetry in 14 stable outpatients with severe COPD (7 with low and 7 with preserved body mass indices) and 7 healthy controls. Endogenous leucine flux, leucine oxidation, and nonoxidative disposal, indices of whole-body protein breakdown, catabolism, and synthesis, were measured using intravenous infusions of (13)C-bicarbonate and 1-(13)C-leucine. Total body water, from which fat-free mass and fat mass were calculated, was determined using an intravenous bolus of deuterated water. Plasma markers of systemic inflammation were also measured. As a group, subjects with COPD had increased REE adjusted for fat-free mass (P < .001) and faster rates of endogenous leucine flux (P = .006) and nonoxidative leucine disposal (P = .002) compared with controls. There was a significant correlation between REE and both endogenous leucine flux (P = .02) and nonoxidative leucine disposal (P = .008). Plasma concentrations of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were not different between COPD subjects and controls. Increased rates of protein turnover are associated with increased REE and loss of fat-free mass in COPD."

CD009647,0,22092671,0,Sex difference in fluid balance responses during prolonged exercise.,"Maintaining a proper fluid balance is important during exercise as athletes are prone to develop dehydration during exercise. Although several factors may regulate the fluid balance, little is known about the role of sex during prolonged moderate-intensity exercise. Therefore, we compared body mass changes and fluid balance parameters in men vs women in a large heterogeneous group of participants during prolonged exercise. Ninety-eight volunteers walked 30-50 km at a self-selected pace. Exercise duration (8 h, 32 min) and intensity (69% HRmax) were comparable between groups. Men demonstrated a significantly larger change in body mass than women (-1.6% vs -0.9%, respectively, P < 0.001) and a higher incidence of dehydration (defined as ≥ 2% body mass loss) compared with women (34% vs 12%, respectively, odds ratio = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.1-16.7). Changes in blood sodium levels were significantly different between men (+1.5 mmol/L) and women (-0.4 mmol/L), while 27% of the men vs 0% of the women showed postexercise hypernatremia (sodium levels ≥ 145 mmol/L). Moreover, men demonstrated a significantly lower fluid intake (2.9 mL/kg/h) and higher fluid loss (5.0 mL/kg/h) compared with women (3.7 and 4.8 mL/kg/h, respectively). Taken together, our data suggest that men and women demonstrate different changes in fluid balance in response to a similar bout of exercise."
CD009647,0,3084274,0,"Angiotensin II, aldosterone and arginine vasopressin in plasma in congestive heart failure.","Angiotensin II (AII), aldosterone (Aldo) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in plasma were determined during basal conditions in seventeen patients with congestive heart failure and in seventeen control subjects. The same parameters were measured before and 1, 2 and 3 h after an oral water load of 20 ml (kg body weight)-1 together with urine volume (V) and free water clearance (CH2O) in seven patients with congestive heart failure and in seven control subjects. AII, Aldo and AVP were significantly higher in heart failure than in control subjects (AII:81 and 12 pmol l(-1) (medians), P less than 0.01; Aldo: 411 and 103 pmol l(-1), P less than 0.01; AVP: 5.3 and 2.0 pmol l)-1), P less than 0.01). AVP was positively correlated to Aldo in both heart failure (p = 0.593, n = 17, P less than 0.02) and control subjects (p = 0.511, n = 17, P less than 0.05), but in neither of the groups to AII. V and CH2O were significantly lower in heart failure when compared to control subjects (maximum increase in CH2O 3.55 and 5.86 ml min-1, P less than 0.02), but did not correlate directly with either A II, Aldo or AVP. Creatinine clearance was reduced in heart failure. It is concluded that the activity of both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the osmoregulatory system is enhanced in congestive heart failure, presumably as a compensatory phenomenon in order to maintain arterial blood pressure. It is suggested that the decrease in free water clearance may be attributed to both an elevated level of vasopressin and a reduced glomerular filtration rate."
CD009647,0,10512155,0,A relationship between urine specific gravity and hyponatremia in hospitalized schizophrenic patients.,"The relationship between urine specific gravity (USG) and the incidence of polydipsia/hyponatremia in hospitalized schizophrenic patients was examined. On the basis of five independent USG values, we identified 49% (35 out of 72) of male and 22% (8 out of 37) of female patients with hyposthenuria (mean USG < or = 1.008). Review of 2 years of records of routine laboratory examinations identified 12 males with hyponatremia, 11 males with borderline hyponatremia, and 49 males with normal values; among female patients, only one patient with hyponatremia and three patients with borderline values were identified. A significantly lower mean USG (1.003 +/- 0.001) for the male patients with hyponatremia compared with the male patients with normal serum sodium data (1.011 +/- 0.005) was observed. All of the male patients with hyponatremia, as well as 18 of the 49 male patients with normal serum sodium values, exhibited hyposthenuria. The USG values of all the patients with hyponatremia were consistently quite low (< or = 1.005), whereas 14 of the 18 normonatremia/hyposthenuria patients had normal USG values (i.e. > or = 1.009) in at least one of five determinations; the mean USG values for most (16 of 18) of the normonatremia/hyposthenuria patients ranged from 1.006 to 1.008. Thus, many hospitalized schizophrenic patients exhibit hyposthenuria of varying degrees, but consistently low USG values are most suggestive of the risk of polydipsia/hyponatremia."
CD009647,0,1981098,0,Effects on renal hemodynamics and tubular function of the contrast medium iohexol in renal patients.,"Renal function was assessed in 20 (11 female and 9 male, age 21-76 years, mean 53) renal patients with a creatinine clearance 25-145 ml/min, mean 95, to evaluate the effects of iohexol, a non-ionic low-osmolar contrast medium. Intravenous urography was performed in 16 patients and computed body tomography in 4, using a dose of iohexol ranged between 0.6-3.3 (mean 1.17) g/kg b.w. Different parameters of renal function were determined in the week preceding and 1, 3 and 5 days after the administration of iohexol. The principal renal effect of iohexol was an increase of urinary alanine aminopeptidase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. The maximum increase of enzymuria was observed on day 1 after the administration of iohexol. In most cases enzymes returned to base-line values within 3 days. No relevant variation of renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow) was observed after iohexol. In conclusion, iohexol can increase of urinary enzymes, but the effect is rapidly reversible and is not accompanied by a clinically significant impairment of renal hemodynamics."

The percentage of water and bone mineral in fat-free mass had a significant effect on the calculated amount of fat using a two-compartment model. A three-compartment model based on field-adapted methods (skinfold thickness + BIA) to calculate body fat, correlated significantly with a more complex four-compartment model (UWW + BIA + DXA) (r = 0.95, p < 0.001). The advantages of three- and four-compartment equations are that they reduce the number of assumptions."
CD009647,0,8264148,0,Prediction of glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine concentration in advanced chronic renal failure.,"In 85 patients with established chronic renal failure, as manifested by serum creatinine concentration ([Cr]) > 0.177 mM (> 2 mg/dl), urinary clearance of 99mTc-DTPA (GFR) and [Cr] were determined one to four times and averaged. GFR was expressed per 3 m2 of height2 rather than in terms of 1.73 m2 of surface area because weight changes but height does not. GFR in these patients averaged 13 ml/min/3 m2 (range 2 to 37). The following equations were derived for predicting GFR from [Cr]-1 (mM-1), age (years) and weight (kg): males, GFR = 7.57 [Cr]-1 - 0.103 age + 0.096 weight - 6.66; females, GFR = 6.05 [Cr]-1 - 0.08 age + 0.08 weight - 4.81. These equations predict GFR in this series with a root mean square error of 3.0 ml/min and account for 89% of the observed variation in GFR. They are applicable only to patients with [Cr] > 0.177 mM (2 mg/dl). More precise estimates can be obtained by including a value for 24-hour urinary urea N, as a measure of protein intake. Less precise but simpler estimates can be obtained from [Cr]-1 alone: males, GFR = 7.58 [Cr]-1 - 4.29; females, GFR = 6.11 [Cr]-1 - 3.8. Expressing [Cr] in mg/dl, the latter equations become: males, GFR = 86 [Cr]-1 - 4.29; females, GFR = 69 [Cr]-1 - 3.8."

Because little was known about the significance of SCC-Ag concentration in patients with esophageal cancer, the aim of this study was to analyze the clinicopathologic significance of SCC-Ag in patients with esophageal SCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Preoperative SCC-Ag concentration was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 309 patients with primary esophageal SCC. All patients underwent curative radical surgery without any preoperative therapy. In 215 of 309 patients, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was also measured to compare clinical significance of CEA with that of SCC-Ag. The prognostic significance for survival of SCC-Ag concentrations was studied with multivariate analysis with Cox proportional hazards model."

At laparotomy, there were 23 macroscopical and 6 microscopical tumors. Nineteen patients were disease-free. Clinical examination, CA 125, and PIIINP were correctly positive in 93, 92, and 82% of cases, respectively. When CA 125 and PIIINP were used simultaneously this value increased to 100%. The sensitivity of CA 125 (43%) and PIIINP (56%) was unsatisfactory, but with their combination it increased to 62%. The use of CA 125, PIIINP, or both increased the sensitivity of clinical examination by 14, 24, and 27%, respectively. Of all the occult tumors, CA 125 detected 33%, PIIINP 57%, and both 66%. The detection rate of macroscopical tumors missed at clinical examination by both was 71%. Hence, PIIINP may be a clinically valuable complement to CA 125 and clinical examination before second-look laparotomy."

Fluid spaces and the renin-angiotensin-system.,"Most of the 52 patients on maintenance dialysis investigated in this study suffered from arterial hypertension in spite of efforts to reduce 'dry weight'. In this situation we found that the majority of patients were underweight and that total body water, extracellular volume and blood volume were close to normal when related to reference systems consisting of height and age. Hypertensive patients were not volume expanded as compared to normotensive patients and controls. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin II were elevated in a few patients, with a trend to higher levels in the more hypertensive patients. Various approaches attempting to correlate blood pressure and the respective volume-renin factors did not prove to be conclusive in explaining the maintenance of hypertension in chronic renal failure on the basis of the sodium-renin feedback."
CD009647,0,1486882,0,Neuroendocrinology of aging in the male and female.,"Many changes in the neuroendocrine axis occur with healthy normal aging in humans. Women cease ovarian follicle maturation and menstrual cycles entering the estrogen-deficient state termed menopause. Although not without risk, estrogen and progesterone replacement in postmenopausal women has been shown to ameliorate the complications of lowered estradiol concentrations, such as hot flushes and osteoporsis, while improving the risk of cardiovascular complications. Aging men have lowered serum free and total testosterone concentrations and may experience a less well defined symptom complex termed andropause. Both signs and symptoms of thyroid disease and interpretation of thyroid function tests are difficult in aging humans. Specifically, TSH secretion is diminished in aging so that suppressed serum TSH concentrations are indicative of but not specific for hyperthyroidism. Cortisol secretion is not altered in aging, although serum concentrations of DHEA-S are lower. Prolactin concentrations are increased in both men and women, with the increase being more pronounced in men. The clinical significance of this increase has not yet been determined. Finally, elderly humans are more likely to develop difficulties with fluid and electrolyte balance. Although some alterations in AVP secretion have been shown in the elderly, plasma concentrations are similar in young and elderly subjects. Other mechanisms, such as decreased glomerular filtration rate and a decreased sensitivity of the thirst mechanism in response to hypertonicity, may be important contributors to fluid and electrolyte imbalances."

CD009647,0,2529385,0,Plasma concentration and renal effect of human atrial natriuretic peptide in nephrotic syndrome.,"To elucidate the pathophysiological role of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in nephrotic syndrome, the plasma level of ANP and renal response to exogenous human alpha-ANP (alpha-hANP) were measured in untreated adult patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) and compared with those of normal volunteers (NL). The plasma concentration of immunoreactive ANP (ir-ANP) in NS (112 +/- 9.8 pg/ml, n = 9, mean +/- SE) was not significantly different from that in NL (98 +/- 8.0 pg/ml, n = 13). However, a significant positive correlation was observed between the plasma ir-ANP level and blood volume in NS (r = 0.714, p less than 0.05). In an infusion study with synthetic alpha-hANP (25 to 100 ng/kg/min), the urine flow rate increased from 0.67 +/- 0.08 to 7.11 +/- 1.08 ml/min in NL (n = 5, p less than 0.01) and from 0.64 +/- 0.16 to 2.88 +/- 0.70 ml/min in NS (n = 9, p less than 0.05) and the urinary sodium excretion increased from 115 +/- 16 to 466 +/- 62 microEq/min in NL (p less than 0.01) and from 51 +/- 8 to 207 +/- 58 microEq/min in NS (p less than 0.01). The absolute and percent changes in urine flow rate and the absolute change in sodium excretion were lower in NS (p less than 0.05) than in NL. The percent change in sodium excretion in NS did not differ from that in NL. In 2 patients with high plasma ir-ANP concentrations, however, infusion of ANP induced poor sodium excretion (59 and 95 microEq/min at 100 ng/kg/min ANP infusion, respectively). Hemodynamic and renal parameters such as blood pressure, pulse rate and creatinine clearance were similarly affected in both NL and NS. We also found that the urinary excretion of protein was significantly increased in NS (p less than 0.05) during infusion of alpha-hANP. Our data suggest that the plasma level of ir-ANP is regulated by blood volume status, and that the renal responsiveness to ANP, at least in part, contributes to water and sodium retention in NS."

Four major age-related changes predispose the elderly to dehydration and hypernatremia: a decrease in total body water, an altered sense of thirst, a decrease in the renal urine concentrating ability, and a decrease in the effectiveness of ADH.

Skin blood flow, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum hydration (capacitance), temperature, pH, and sebum content of the skin surface were measured. In both groups, skin blood flow in the nose showed the highest value. Perioral and nasolabial areas showed the highest TEWL values. The neck showed the highest capacitance value. The highest skin temperature was detected in the neck in the young group and in the nasolabial area in the old group. The chin showed the most alkaline pH in both groups. Nasolabial area showed the highest sebum content in the young group, as did the chin in the old group. These baseline values provide a framework to build on for ascertaining disease and intervention-related effects."

CD009647,0,16813917,0,A clinical investigation of nocturnal polyuria in patients with nocturia: a diurnal variation in arginine vasopressin secretion and its relevance to mean blood pressure.,Nocturia is a common lower urinary condition in the elderly population and nocturnal polyuria is recognized as a major factor responsible for nocturia. A functional change in osmotic or nonosmotic control regarding the water-salt balance with aging may contribute to nocturnal polyuria. This study evaluated plasma arginine vasopressin secretion function in symptomatic patients with nocturnal polyuria and the impact of mean blood pressure on nocturnal polyuria.
CD009647,0,1836167,0,[Sodium and diseases in the aged].,"The authors describe serum sodium levels in elderly patients at hospitalization and evaluate the role attributable to drugs, diseases, nutrition and fluid balance. Among 167 patients (average age 75.29 +/- 7.14), 132 (79.04%) had normal sodium balance, 34 (20.36%) were hyponatremic and only 1 (0.60%) was hypernatremic. Patients who had serum sodium levels above 129 mEq/l were asymptomatic. In five cases hyponatremia was acute and severe (less than or equal to 127 mEq/l). Seven patients who had serum sodium levels less than 127 mEq/l presented psychiatric and neurological manifestations, which subsided completely after prompt correction of the electrolyte disorder. The authors suggest that the pathogenesis of hyponatremia in pathological states in the elderly is complex, although iatrogenic causes play a fundamental role."

CD009647,0,7918327,0,Measuring the body composition of elderly subjects: a comparison of methods.,"There is a paucity of data on differences between methods for the assessment of body composition in elderly subjects. Studies on younger adults suggest that such differences are of some practical significance at the individual level. In the present study the following methods of estimating percentage body fatness (BF%) were compared in healthy elderly men and women (mean age 70 (SD 6) years: densitometry; skinfold thickness; total body water; bioelectrical impedance (BIA) using an age-specific predictive equation and the manufacturers' equation; body mass index (BMI). Though BF% estimates from the various methods tended to be highly correlated with those from densitometry and with each other, differences between methods at the individual level were marked. In particular, the age-specific equations based on BMI and BIA systematically overestimated BF% relative to the other methods. Biases between BF% estimates derived from densitometry, skinfolds, BIA (manufacturers' equation) and total body water were less marked, indicating little evidence of systematic differences between these methods in elderly subjects. Individual differences between methods were slightly greater than those reported in some studies of younger adults, but this may be of little practical significance, and may be considered inevitable in view of variability between and within subjects in the extent to which the underlying assumptions of these two-component methods are met in elderly subjects."
CD009647,0,18204323,0,Intra and extra cellular fluid shifts during the inter dialytic period in conventional and daily hemodialysis patients.,"Previous studies indicate that fluid loss during dialysis occurs from the leg extracellular fluid (ECF) maintaining the central blood volume (CBV). Our goal was to determine change in ECF and intracellular fluid (ICF) volumes for the segments of the body throughout the inter-dialytic period. Six conventional and five daily subjects on hemodialysis (HD) had segmental bioimpedance (SBIA) performed using the Hydra ECF/ICF Spectrum Analyzer 4200. Measurements were taken pre/postdialysis and 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours after dialysis. The conventional dialysis patients had measurements 48 hours after dialysis. There were no differences in baseline characteristics noted between the conventional and daily HD patients. For both groups, from pre to postdialysis, there was a reduction in the ECF for each of the segments (leg, arm, and trunk) (p < 0.05). There was no change in ECF during the 4 hours after dialysis. ECF values at 24 hours for both groups returned closer to baseline. The conventional group's leg and arm ECF returned to baseline at 48 hours. This suggests that ECF is slowly refilled during the inter-dialytic period. The majority of fluid loss and refilling takes place in the extremities to maintaining the CBV. The increase in leg ECF mimics the consumption of fluid during the inter-dialytic period."
CD009647,0,4036980,0,Clinical significance of the elevated anion gap.,"To determine the clinical significance of a high anion gap (more than 16 meq/liter), consecutive patients in whom electrolyte determinations were made in an emergency room and who had either a normal (8 to 16 meq/liter) (n = 571) or a high (n = 100) anion gap were contrasted. No differences were noted between the groups with regard to age or length of stay in the hospital, but in the group with a high anion gap, there was an increased severity and frequency of multiple electrolyte disorders, and higher general admission rates (66 percent with high anion gap versus 51 percent with normal anion gap, p less than 0.02), rates of admission to an intensive care unit (25 percent with high anion gap versus 14 percent with normal anion gap, p less than 0.03), and mortality within one week of admission (12 percent with high anion gap versus 0.5 percent with normal anion gap, p less than 0.001) as compared with the group with a normal anion gap. Notably, patients without severe electrolyte abnormalities and a high anion gap had higher admission rates and a 50-fold increased mortality rate as compared with the group without severe electrolyte disturbances and a normal anion gap. Thus, an elevated anion gap is associated with an increased severity of illness that is independent of concomitant severe electrolyte abnormalities. Patients with a normal or high anion gap that survived the first week of hospitalization were shown to have an extremely low risk for mortality."

AGTR1 polymorphism has been reported to associate with hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI), and metabolic traits. Here we describe a novel approach to quantitation of transcript haplotypes (QTH) of AGTR1. To determine relative allelic expression from haplotypes, within-individual-between-allele ratiometric analyses in placental cDNA were developed for the transcribed SNPs rs5182:C>T (encoding p.L191) and rs5186:A>C (3'-noncoding ""A1166C""). Additionally, between-individual comparisons were made using TaqMan assays applied to both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes and haplotypes. In conjunction, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genomic haplotype associations with metabolic syndrome were examined. There was no significant difference of mRNA level for alleles of rs5182:C>T, but allele and mRNA haplotypes carrying 1166C exhibited reduced abundance. The effect was much greater in CC homozygotes than in heterozygotes. The promoter region was confirmed to be in a separate haplotype block from the AGTR1 3' region containing rs5182:C>T and rs5186:A>C. Metabolic syndrome trait associations were strongest for the 3' block generally and for the C allele of rs5186:A>C specifically. All effects were much more prominent in homozygotes, possibly reflecting interallelic interaction through feedback loops of mRNA regulation. Differential abundance of AGTR1 mRNA haplotypes may mediate clinical phenotypic observations of the AGTR1 genotype."
CD009647,0,1744326,0,The haemodynamic effects of intermittent haemofiltration in critically ill patients.,The haemodynamic effects of intermittent high volume venovenous haemofiltration were studied in 13 critically ill patients. The mean negative fluid balance during filtration was 1.21 and the mean duration of treatment 3 h 40 min. The cardiac index fell initially (4.5 +/- 0.2 to 3.8 +/- 0.21/min/m2; p less than 0.05) but then remained stable throughout treatment before returning to baseline at the end of haemofiltration. The mean arterial pressure was unchanged with an increase in the systemic vascular resistance (651 +/- 33 to 765 +/- 65 dyne.s/cm5; p less than 0.05) suggesting that vascular responsiveness is maintained during haemofiltration.
CD009647,0,17466972,0,"Urine osmolality, cyclic AMP and aquaporin-2 in urine of patients under lithium treatment in response to water loading followed by vasopressin administration.","Lithium is the drug that is most frequently associated with acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). The exact mechanism of lithium-induced NDI in man is unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the kidney response to minimal and maximal stimulation of the kidney urine concentrating mechanism by measuring urine osmolality, and urine levels of cAMP and AQP-2 in urine of patients under long-term lithium treatment. Twenty patients under long-term lithium treatment were included. The kidney urinary 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP), aquaporin-2 levels and urine osmolality were determined during a situation of minimal kidney urine concentrating activity (induced by water loading) and during a situation following maximal stimulation of kidney urine concentrating activity (induced by 1-desamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin). Patients were classified as NDI, partial NDI and non-NDI based on maximal reached urine osmolality. The partial correlation (r) between urinary cyclic AMP levels (mol/l) and urine osmolality was 0.94 (P<0.001). No significant correlation was observed between urinary aquaporin-2 levels (mol/mol creatinine) and osmolality nor between urinary cyclic AMP and aquaporin-2 levels. The rise in urinary cyclic AMP but not aquaporin-2 levels upon 1-desamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin administration after water loading significantly differed between the three categories, decreasing with increasing NDI category. In conclusion we found that in lithium-induced kidney urine concentrating deficit in man, the cyclic AMP generation in response to 1-desamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin administration after water loading, is impaired. It remains to be elucidated whether principal cells, G-proteins or adenylate cyclase e.g. are the major targets for the mechanism underlying lithium-induced NDI in man."

CD009647,0,16921688,0,Effects of conventional ultrafiltration on renal performance during adult cardiopulmonary bypass procedures.,"Ultrafiltration has been used successfully in a variety of applications in the perioperative setting to assist in hemoconcentration and volume reduction. This study was designed to investigate the effects of aggressive conventional hemofiltration on bypass urine production, fluid balance, and renal performance in the 24 hours after bypass procedures in the adult population. A prospective, randomized study was designed to determine the effects of conventional ultrafiltration (CUF) during bypass while monitoring urine dynamics intraoperatively and in the 24-hour post-bypass period. Study group 1 (CUF, n = 49) was compared to control group 2 (non-CUF, n = 47) by monitoring urine values, volume additions, and packed red cell (PRC) use throughout the procedure. The mean total CUF volume removed from group 1 was 5781 +/- 2612. There were no differences in pre-bypass, total bypass, or total operating room (OR) urine between the two groups. The 24-hour urine totals were significantly higher in group 2 (2389 +/- 895) than in group 1 (2035 +/- 895). The ending bypass hematocrit was also lower in group 2 (26 +/- 2.0) than in group 1 (30 +/- 6.0). OR PRC additions were higher in group 2 (395 +/- 699) than group 1 (204 +/- 300). The non-CUF control group 2 experienced significantly greater ending fluid balance (3006 +/- 868) compared with group 1 (744 +/- 1271). No significant differences in pre- or postoperative creatinine values were observed. Aggressive CUF can be safely used during cardiopulmonary bypass in the adult population to reduce fluid accumulation and elevate bypass hematocrit without effecting bypass or intraoperative urine production."
CD009647,0,8980158,0,Effects of four years' treatment with biosynthetic human growth hormone (GH) on body composition in GH-deficient hypopituitary adults.,"Short-term trials of growth hormone (GH) substitution in hypopituitary adults have shown beneficial effects on body composition. To evaluate the long-term effects on body composition, we followed thirteen GH-deficient adults (GH < 6 mU/l following standard provocative tests) for 4 years of GH replacement. At yearly intervals, serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist, waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR) and resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were determined, and body composition was assessed using three independent methods: total body potassium (TBK), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Compared to baseline, IGF-I levels increased significantly at 1 (p = 0.0001), 2 (p = 0.0004), 3 (p = 0.006) and 4 years (p = 0.002). Body weight and BMI changed minimally at 1, 2 and 3 years and increased significantly only at the fourth year (p = 0.012 and p = 0.0009, respectively) of GH therapy. Waist and WHR decreased significantly at 1, 2 and 4 years (waist: p = 0.0009, p = 0.0004, p = 0.049; WHR: p = 0.0025, p = 0.012, p = 0.047, respectively). Neither resting SBP nor DBP changed significantly. Fat-free mass (FFM) derived from TBK and BIA increased significantly at 1 (p = 0.004; p = 0.004), 2 (p = 0.003; p = 0.05), 3 (p = 0.005; p = 0.04) and 4 years (p = 0.02; p = 0.002). Using DXA, the increase in FFM was significant at 1 (p = 0.007) and 2 years (p = 0.008) but not at 3 and 4 years. Percentage body fat measured by TBK, BIA and DXA decreased significantly at 1 (p = 0.008; p = 0.003; p = 0.03), 2 (p = 0.018; p = 0.06; p = 0.049) and 4 years (p = 0.03; p = 0.002; p = 0.04). A rise in total body water, calculated from BIA, was observed at 1 year (p = 0.004) and was maintained throughout the treatment period. These data demonstrate that 4 years of GH treatment in hypopituitary adults is associated with sustained improvement in body composition."
CD009647,0,14689078,0,[Acrocyanosis: crucial symptom in a case of chronic diarrhea and weight loss].,The patient reported here was admitted because of severe dehydration caused by watery diarrhea. As underlying disease we found bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel due to myopathic dysmotility of the small bowel as a manifestation of CREST syndrome. An important clue to the diagnosis was the result of a ward round: the patient showed Raynaud's phenomenon when exposed to the cold at an open window airing the room. A leading tool for diagnosis and therapy proved to be small bowel manometry which is further discussed in this case report.
CD009647,0,2742425,0,Mortality in elderly patients with thermoregulatory failure.,"Fifty-four elderly patients with thermoregulatory failure were evaluated retrospectively. The most commonly associated cause was underlying sepsis, which occurred in 78% of cases. Underlying conditions that increased the incidence of hypothermia were hypoproteinemia (50%), cachexia (30%), and neuroleptic medications (21%), most commonly thioridazine. Digoxin toxicity was a common finding (20% of all cases). One third of the patients developed hypothermia in warm months and half of them developed it while in the hospital. Patients who presented with hypothermia from out of the hospital had lower temperatures, were more bradycardic and hemoconcentrated, and died more rapidly than the in-hospital group. This could be explained by lower outside temperature or delay in diagnosis and treatment of the underlying disease. The overall mortality rate was extremely high (74%) in both groups. The mortality rate was not affected by age, sex, or degree of hypothermia. We conclude that thermo-regulatory failure in the elderly can occur in warm as well as cold environments or climates. The development of hypothermia in elderly patients should be promptly treated as sepsis unless proven otherwise, in light of the poor prognosis of this condition."
CD009647,0,1741806,0,Duration of intravenous fluid replacement after abdominal surgery: a prospective randomised study.,"This prospective randomised study examined the possibility of early resumption of oral hydration and discontinuation of intravenous fluid replacement after emergency or elective abdominal surgery. Following elective cholecystectomy alone or with a choledocholithotomy or an emergency Hartmann's procedure for large bowel obstruction, patients were randomised to early oral hydration (sips of water for 12 h followed by free fluids by mouth for 24 h, when oral intake of food was allowed--intravenous hydration was discontinued 6 h after starting the intake of free fluids orally) or conventional intravenous hydration (intravenous hydration and an oral regimen of water as follows: sips every hour for 12 h, 30 ml every hour for 24 h, 60 ml every hour for 24 h, 90 ml every hour for 24 h, free fluids for 12 h, when food was allowed--intravenous hydration was discontinued 6 h after starting the free fluids). The two regimens were equally effective in maintaining fluid balance and normal plasma and urinary electrolytes without any observed differences in biochemical or metabolic values. Each of free fluids by mouth, discontinuation of intravenous hydration, and consumption of solid food were achieved in the patients on early oral hydration at time periods significantly shorter than those attained with the conventional regimen (P less than 0.001). Similarly, patients on the latter regimen were hospitalised for significantly longer times than those on early oral hydration (P less than 0.001). Early oral hydration after biliary surgery or a Hartmann's procedure effectively maintains fluid balance and has advantages over the conventional intravenous hydration regimen."
CD009647,0,2038133,0,Renal failure with nephrotic syndrome: reversal with large doses of furosemide.,"The present study documents the occurrence of renal failure in 4 nephrotic patients including 3 with minor glomerular lesions and one with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. One patient died of sepsis at 3 months after onset of the acute renal failure. In the remaining 3, forced diuresis employing albumin plus furosemide in increasing doses to 600 mg/day reversed the renal failure independent of corticosteroid therapy. All of the 4 patients showed characteristic findings consisting of a remarkably low fractional excretion of sodium and an unexpectedly low urine osmolality at the onset of acute renal failure, although they were rather hypervolemic. Our findings suggest that the occurrence of a low fractional excretion of sodium and low osmolality may provide a good index of an absolute indication for intensive weight reduction therapy such as high-dose furosemide in nephrotic patients with acute renal failure in order to reverse the acute renal failure."

CD009647,0,16874705,0,Recurrent hyponatremia in a patient with chronic kidney disease.,"Hyponatremia, albeit common in chronic renal insufficiency, necessitates a detailed search of the underlying hidden causes. We report on a 67-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease (creatinine 230 micromol/L) and hypertension who suffered from general fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and abdominal fullness off and on for 6 months. Hyponatremia (plasma Na(+) 106-125 mmol/L) on 4 occasions during the past 6 months was noticed. Her extracellular volume status was apparently normal. Plasma Na(+) concentration 110 mmol/L was the most striking laboratory abnormality with mild metabolic acidosis (HCO(3)- 19.8 mmol/L). Her urine Na(+) concentration and osmolality were inappropriately high. Her hyponatremia was refractory to normal saline, hypertonic NaHCO(3) and 0.1-microg 9 alfa-fludrocortisone. Despite normal plasma cortisol and thyroid hormone concentrations, a provocation test with cosyntropin (250 microg) showed a blunted cortisol (<579 nmol/L) but intact aldosterone response. Magnetic resonance imaging of her brain displayed a normal pituitary gland and hypothalamus. A history of intermittent intravenous steroid therapy to treat her allergic rhinitis for 3 years was uncovered. Steroid supplements induced water diuresis and corrected hyponatremia to 135 mmol/L in 5 days. With nonspecific clinical symptoms, glucocorticoid insufficiency must be kept in mind as a cause of hyponatremia even in patients with impaired renal function and normal plasma cortisol concentration."

Shape and volume of constituent urine fractions.,"Ureteral transport was studied in 50 urinary systems by urography with video recording in the upright and recumbent positions using low-osmolality and high-osmolality contrast media. Morphometry and volumetry were applied to right urinary systems in which the urine-filled segments had a circular cross section at maximum peristaltic distension. The filling of the lumbar segment was composed of four fractions, each entering that segment by a specific mechanism: 1) the residual urine left behind by the preceding contraction ring, 2) the postcontraction injection from the pyelocalyceal system, 3) the extraperistaltic flow, and 4) the peristaltic injection produced by the pyelocalyceal contraction rings. The variations in the precontraction filling by fractions 1-3 and in the volume of fraction 4 gave rise to four types of transport. The junction between the lumbar and pelvic segments constituted a constant point of resistance to flow that prevented fractions 1-3 from entering the pelvic segment, the peristaltic injection into that segment being determined solely by the resistance at the junction and the volume of the bolus in the lumbar segment. Extraperistaltic flow to the bladder constituted a separate type of transport."
CD009647,0,19169021,0,Bioimpedance analysis in dialysis: state of the art and what we can expect.,"Dialysis must control the body's fluid content accurately in order to maintain optimal health. The only commonly used, practical and objective measurements we have to guide fluid removal are very inaccurate. Recent study has validated bioimpedance (BIA) as an objective measure of fluid and nutritional status in dialysis patients. There are a number of different methods suitable for routine use available to the clinician. Single-frequency whole-body BIA uses inexpensive equipment capable of almost instantaneous or continuous measurement. The results can be used to give an indication of a patient's fluid content, nutrition and body composition when compared to appropriate reference values. Multiple-frequency whole-body BIA can be used to calculate excess fluid volume to within 1-2 liters. The equipment is more expensive than for single-frequency BIA, but the output is much easier to interpret. Multiple-frequency segmental BIA is more complicated to perform, but subject to less interference from changes in fluid distribution (e.g. resulting from hemodialysis or changes in posture). It is not suitable for routine use but could be considered as a gold standard for occasional clinical BIA."

An alternative mechanism other than uricosuria or xanthine oxidase inhibition must account for some of the hypouricaemic action of this drug. During the first day of treatment urine volume and pH declined sharply. In a separate investigation, 22 patients were given azapropazone and 18 were given allopurinol combined with colchicine for 3 months. Allopurinol reduced plasma uric acid more quickly but at the end of the study there was little difference in the hypouricaemic results achieved by both drugs. Recurrent gout occurred more frequently with allopurinol but side-effects were confined to those taking azapropazone. A slight rise in blood urea and creatinine and a fall in haemoglobin were also features of long-term azapropazone treatment."

CD009647,0,21132638,0,[When to start chronic dialysis: as late as possible].,"Current recommendations for the initiation of dialysis are based on the level of kidney failure and on clinical evidence of uremia. Several nephrology societies advocate the early start of dialysis, i.e., when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is higher than or equal to 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, to minimize the clinical and social problems related to advanced uremia. It is not fully known whether the early start of dialysis is beneficial, harmful or neutral with respect to the outcome of dialysis treatment in end stage renal disease. Recent studies have reported no benefit in patient survival from initiating dialysis treatment at a higher GFR. The available data indicate that the mortality while on dialysis may be higher with an early start, and that there is no significant benefit in terms of quality of life. Whether this is explained by a greater comorbidity burden or detrimental effects of early initiation remains unclear. In clinical practice, there is considerable variation in the timing of initiation of maintenance dialysis for patients with end stage renal disease. We support initiating dialysis at a lower GFR (< -7.0 mL/min) provided that patients are given careful clinical management, and at an even lower rate in selected elderly patients given a supplemented very low protein diet.

CD009647,0,3974629,0,Genetic monitoring of aluminum workers exposed to coal tar pitch volatiles.,"A group of 50 workers exposed to coal tar pitch volatiles (CTPV) in an aluminum reduction plant and a group of 50 non-exposed workers were selected to evaluate the genotoxic effects of CTPV exposure. A battery of tests was performed on 3 different body fluids; urine, blood and semen. Urine samples were evaluated for mutagenic constituents using the Ames/Salmonella assay. Cultured lymphocytes from blood samples were used to perform cytogenetic analysis. Semen samples were used to measure sperm count, percent abnormal sperm morphology and frequency of sperm carrying double fluorescent bodies (2-F). 14 of 28 (50%) exposed workers and 7 of 36 (19.4%) non-exposed workers had mutagenic urine. This difference was significant (p less than 0.01). Among the non-smokers a significantly higher percentage of workers who were exposed had positive urine (36%) compared to the non-exposed workers (5%) (p less than 0.05). Among the exposed group, more mechanics had mutagenic urine than did other types of workers. Overall chromosome aberration rates were similar in both exposed and non-exposed workers. Among exposed workers a significant inverse correlation (p less than 0.05) between age and chromatid aberration rate was observed. Results of semen analysis failed to detect differences between exposed and non-exposed workers. Results of these tests lend support to a battery approach to genetic monitoring and suggest a link between exposure to CTPV and genotoxic effects. Detection of exposure to mutagens at an early time offers an opportunity for disease prevention by the reduction of exposure."

In both episodes, the serum contained ethanol, acetone, and 2-propanol (isopropanol), but no methanol or ethylene glycol. In the first episode, the rates of excretion of acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate in the urine were greatly increased. Volume repletion was the only treatment. In both episodes, azotemia and metabolic acidosis were rapidly reversed, while modest metabolic alkalosis was noted after treatment. The triad of azotemia, elevated osmolal gap, and high anion gap metabolic acidosis, which characterizes intoxication with methanol or ethylene glycol, can also develop in alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA), an entity with substantially different management and outcome. Finding 2-propanol in the serum of patients with AKA indicates either concomitant 2-propanol ingestion or formation of 2-propanol from acetone."

The first case was a 59-year-old man, without a history of diabetes, treated with prednisone for jaundice and marked weight loss over the last month, and admitted in hyperosmolar coma (346 m0sm/l). After recovery from the acute episode, a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas was established following operation. The patient died six months later. The second case, a 71-year-old man also without a history of diabetes, was admitted in hyperosmolar coma (315 m0sm/l) during the course of a pulmonary infection. Rapidly fatal cholostatic jaundice appeared one year later. An adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas was demonstrated at autopsy. The diagnostic criteria in both cases were those of hyperosmolar diabetic coma. Though cases of combined diabetes and pancreatic cancer are well documented, only one case of hyperosmolar coma and cancer of the pancreas has been reported in the published literature. The pathogenesis of hyperosmolar diabetic coma is discussed. The fact that it developed during the course of a pancreatic affection could be explained by a functional reduction in insulin secretion, associated with a triggering factor such as dehydration, infection, hypoglycemic agent administration, etc... The onset of hyperosmolar diabetic coma in an elderly patient without a history of diabetes, especially with associated marked weight loss, should lead to investigation for a possible pancreatic cancer."

CD009647,0,21166367,0,Diagnosis of secondary hypertension: an age-based approach.,"Secondary hypertension is a type of hypertension with an underlying, potentially correctable cause. A secondary etiology may be suggested by symptoms (e.g., flushing and sweating suggestive of pheochromocytoma), examina- tion findings (e.g., a renal bruit suggestive of renal artery stenosis), or laboratory abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia suggestive of aldosteronism). Secondary hypertension also should be considered in patients with resistant hyper- tension, and early or late onset of hypertension. The prevalence of secondary hypertension and the most common etiologies vary by age group. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of adults with hypertension have a secondary cause. In young adults, particu- larly women, renal artery stenosis caused by fibromuscular dyspla- sia is one of the most common secondary etiologies. Fibromuscular dysplasia can be detected by abdominal magnetic resonance imag- ing or computed tomography. These same imaging modalities can be used to detect atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, a major cause of secondary hypertension in older adults. In middle-aged adults, aldosteronism is the most common secondary cause of hyperten- sion, and the recommended initial diagnostic test is an aldosterone/ renin ratio. Up to 85 percent of children with hypertension have an identifiable cause, most often renal parenchymal disease. Therefore, all children with confirmed hypertension should have an evaluation for an underlying etiology that includes renal ultrasonography."

The examinations included physical examination, laboratory study, plain X-ray film of the abdomen, gastrointestinal radiography, gastrointestinal endoscopy, endoscopic biopsy, surgery, and autopsy. The results were as follows: 1) Amyloid fibril proteins consisted of amyloid light chain protein (AL) in 7 patients, amyloid A protein (AA) in 36, beta 2-microglobulin (AH) in one, and prealbumin (AF) in one. 2) At the time of examination, gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 43 (96%) of the 45 patients. The incidence of diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding was higher in patients with the AA type than in those with other types, whereas abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting were more frequently evident in patients with the AL type. 3) The incidence of hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, and positive occult blood was higher in patients with the AA type, whereas abnormal electrocardiogram and cardiac failure were more frequently observed in patients with the AL type. The thyroid gland was enlarged in 7 patients with the AA type, and the macroglossia was evident in only 2 patients with the AL type. 4) The frequency of radiographic abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract was as follows: 79% of the patients in the jejunum and ileum, 61% in the duodenum, 53% in the stomach, 32% in the colorectum, and 14% in the esophagus. Fine granular shadows were most frequently seen in patients with the AA type, whereas multiple polypoid protrusions and thickening of the folds were characteristic in patients with the AL type. 5) Endoscopic abnormalities were found as follows: 82% in the duodenum, 81% in the jejunum, 73% in the stomach, 42% in the colorectum, and 20% in the esophagus. Endoscopy revealed fine granular appearance in 31 (86%) of the 36 patients with the AA type, whereas multiple polypoid protrusions and thickening of the folds were evident in 5 (71%) of the 7 patients with the AL type. 6) On the histological examination of the biopsy specimens, amyloid deposition was found in the duodenum in 98% of the 45 patients studied, in the jejunum in 96% of the 26 patients, in the antrum in 93% of the 41 patients, and in the rectum in 86% of the 43 patients. 7) Histological findings of the biopsy and autopsy specimens revealed that the the degree of amyloid deposition was the highest in the duodenum and jejunum of the gastrointestinal tract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,16790652,0,The value of an albumin-based intravascular volume replacement strategy in elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.,"The value of human albumin (HA) for treating hypovolemia is controversial. Less expensive alternatives such as hydroxyethyl starch (HES) are sometimes refused because of unwanted side effects. We prospectively randomized 50 patients older than 70 years old undergoing major abdominal surgery to receive either 5% HA (n = 25) or a third generation HES preparation (6% HES 130/0.4; n = 25) when mean arterial blood pressure was <60 mm Hg and central venous pressure was <10 mm Hg. Hemodynamics, inflammation (interleukin-6), endothelial activation-integrity (adhesion molecules), coagulation (thrombelastography), and renal function (including kidney-specific proteins) were monitored after the induction of anesthesia, after surgery, 5 h in the intensive care unit, and on the first postoperative day. HA patients received 3960 +/- 590 mL of HA and 5070 +/- 1030 mL of Ringer's lactate solution, and HES patients received 3500 +/- 530 mL of HES and 4550 +/- 880 mL of Ringer's lactate solution. Total protein remained normal only in the HA-treated patients. No significant differences (P > 0.1) between the groups were seen with regard to hemodynamics, coagulation, and kidney function. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 and soluble adhesion molecules were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the HA- than in the HES-treated patients. We conclude that HA in elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery can easily be replaced by a modern HES preparation. Because of the decreased inflammatory response and endothelial activation-injury, HES 130/0.4 seems to be the more appropriate fluid strategy for these patients."

CD009647,0,2633107,0,The release of thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha following pulmonary embolism.,"It has been shown in animals that acute obstruction of pulmonary artery branches is followed by an early but shortly lived increase in blood levels of thromboxane B2 and a subsequent longer-lasting increase in blood levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Our study was conducted on twelve patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Nine were treated with urokinase; three could not be given thrombolytic or anticoagulant drugs due to bleeding peptic ulcer (2 cases) or recent cerebral hemorrhage (1 case). HPLC and RIA tests were performed on arterial blood samples at diagnosis and after 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Findings were compared with those in a control group of 6 healthy subjects. There was a difference in prostanoid behaviour between the untreated and urokinase treated patients. Among the former mean TxB2 was significantly raised at clinical onset and began to decline after 6-12 hours, approaching the mean level found among the controls after 24 hours. In contrast 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was raised after 1 hour and gradually declined thereafter. In the subjects treated with urokinase TxB2 was already close to the mean control level after 1 hour; 6-keto-PGF1 alpha had increased after 1 hour but had returned near the control level after 12. The behaviour of prostanoids appears to match the clinical course."
CD009647,0,2245593,0,Diminished meal-induced thermogenesis in elderly man.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the possible influence of age on thermogenic response to a mixed meal in healthy subjects. Twenty-five healthy male subjects participated in the study and they were divided into three groups, comprising 10 young subjects with an average age of 27 years (22-35 years), seven middle-aged individuals (51 years, 42-60 years) and eight elderly men (70 years, 67-74 years). They were all studied with continuous indirect calorimetry in the basal state and for 3 h after the ingestion of a mixed meal in liquid form. The size of the meal corresponded to 60% of the individually computed 24-h basal energy expenditure. Resting energy expenditure was lower in the elderly men than in the young ones when expressed in absolute values (P less than 0.001) as well as in relation to body weight (P less than 0.01) and body surface area (P less than 0.01). After the meal energy expenditure increased rapidly and reached a relatively constant level after 60 min in all groups; the average increase above the basal level during the whole postprandial period was less in the elderly (21.1 +/- 2.5%, P less than 0.01) and the middle-aged (24.2 +/- 1.7%, P less than 0.05) than in the young (28.6 +/- 1.6%) men. It is concluded that the thermogenic response during the first 3 h following a mixed meal decreases with age and that this diminished meal-induced thermogenesis may contribute to lower nutrient requirements in old age."

CD009647,0,10736333,0,Four-day multimedia diet records underestimate energy needs in middle-aged and elderly women as determined by doubly-labeled water.,"Systematic problems exist in the quantification of food intake in populations using traditional self-reported measures. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an innovative multimedia diet record (MMDR) for dietary energy intake assessment. Dietary intake was estimated by combining the use of a microcassette tape recorder and 35-mm camera in 53 women whose ages ranged from 50 to 93 y (64.9 +/- 11.3 y), with body weights of 62.4 +/- 12.2 kg and body mass indexes (BMI) of 24.4 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2). Using household measures, subjects voice-recorded and photographed all food and beverages consumed for four consecutive days. A two-point doubly-labeled water (DLW) method was used over 13 d to calculate carbon dioxide production, total body water, and subsequently, total energy expenditure (TEE) through the use of a food quotient. Mean body weight did not change between d 1 and 14. TEE and reported energy intake were compared using MMDR. Mean reported energy intakes 7.5 +/- 1.9 MJ/d (1774 +/- 476 kcal/d) were lower (P < 0.01) than TEE by 10.4 +/- 3.1 MJ/d (2477 +/- 736 kcal/d), indicating underreporting of food intake. Reporting accuracy (reported energy intake/TEE' 100%) was 76.0 +/- 22.9%. Mean energy expenditure (MJ/d), as determined by doubly-labeled water, was higher (P < 0.01) in each stratified age range when compared to reported energy intake by MMDR. There were no significant differences in reporting accuracy among the stratified age groups. Using the MMDR method, this population of weight-stable women underreported their food intakes compared to their determined energy expenditure estimated by DLW."

CD009647,0,1457845,0,Total body water measured by bioelectrical impedance in patients after hemodialysis. Comparison with urea kinetics.,"Bioelectrical impedance (BEI) measurements have been used to measure total body water volume (VBEI). The VBEI were measured after hemodialysis in 14 patients, as was dialyzer blood water urea clearance (KBW) and dialysate urea clearance (KD). Urea clearance based on the mass transfer coefficient, KoA, was determined (KKoA). Residual renal function was measured, and three point variable volume single pool urea kinetic modeling (UKM) was done. Urea distribution volumes were calculated using the measured urea clearance values from blood water (VBW), dialysate (VD), and KoA (VKoA) as inputs. Direct dialysate quantitation was calculated based on total dialysate collections to measure urea clearance (KDDQ) and urea distribution volume (VDDQ). Total body water estimates were made using the Hume and Watson anthropometric formulas (VHUME and VWATSON). It was found that average VBEI (34.76 L) was larger than VBW (27.50 L) and VD (26.69 L), but it was not different from VKoA (32.15 L), VHUME (35.15 L), or VWATSON (34.53 L). Linear regression revealed a good correlation between VBEI and both VBW and VD (R = 0.873 and 0.882, respectively). The BEI measurements provide a simple method for measuring total body water in dialysis patients that correlated well with UKM volumes."

CD009647,0,8555551,0,Accuracy of an on-line urea monitor compared with urea kinetic model and direct dialysis quantification.,"To verify the accuracy of a urea monitor (UM) to assess dialysis adequacy, it was compared with a modified direct dialysis quantification method (mDDQ) and with a Casino modified urea kinetic model (mUKM) algorithm. Simplified Jindal and Daugirdas formulas, an anthropometric body water Watson formula, bioelectric impedance analysis, and the Garred model have also been considered. Concerning urea removal, UM results are close to mDDQ, as are the predialytic blood urea nitrogen values obtained by UM in the initial equilibration test. Urea distribution volume results for UM, mDDQ, and bioelectric impedance analysis are similar, whereas it appears clearly overestimated by the Watson formula. Urea monitor clearances are not significantly different from mDDQ, unlike UM Kt/V, which is slightly higher than mDDQ reference value, although with a satisfactory degree of concordance. Rebound effect must be considered by sampling after the equilibration time (et) when mUKM or simplified Kt/V formulas are used: mUKMet Kt/V results are quite similar to mDDQ, as is the Daugirdas value. Regarding NPCR, UM results are neither significantly different from mDDQ nor from the Garred model, whereas mUKM results are significantly overestimated. When rebound is considered, NPCR by mUKMet and NCPR by mDDQ are identical. The UM approach is simple and practical, with a satisfactory degree of reliability for clinical practice."

Burns induced by hot air are even more rare and constitute a very small subgroup of all sauna burns. Hot air burns are characterised by a combination of full thickness skin damage with deep tissue destruction. We report here on six consecutive patients suffering from hot air sauna burns with rhabdomyolysis. All six patients were middle-aged, the majority of them men. Acute excessive consumption of alcohol exacerbated by a hot environment resulted in dehydration and loss of consciousness. Immobility and prolonged exposure to hot, dry air resulted in third degree regional burns with 5-32% TBSA. Rhabdomyolysis was evident on admission. The laboratory values of plasma creatine kinase (P-CK), plasma myoglobin (PM), blood pH, and serum potassium (S-K) during the first five days were evaluated. Aggressive fluid management and correction of acidosis and myoglobinuria were started on admission. Surgical management consisted of early, aggressive excision at fascial level, in some patients involving sacrifice of the upper layers of muscle. Even so, mortality in this small series was 50%.

CD009647,0,8776121,0,Hyperkalemia in the elderly: a group at high risk.,"Hyperkalemia is a serious electrolyte disorder which appears to develop more commonly in the aged patient. The elderly may be predisposed to hyperkalemia as a result of underlying abnormalities in potassium homeostasis. These include inapparent renal insufficiency, tubulointerstitial disease in the kidney, disturbed aldosterone production, and abnormal salt and water balance. Several commonly prescribed medications may further disrupt potassium balance and promote the development of hyperkalemia in these patients. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a commonly used antimicrobial agent, has recently been noted to cause hyperkalemia in the elderly, even with standard dosage. The elderly should be considered at high risk to develop hyperkalemia, especially when they are using certain medications. Potassium concentration should be monitored closely when these patients are hospitalized and/or treated with potassium-altering medications."
CD009647,0,449660,0,The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH): pathophysiologic mechanisms in solute and volume regulation.,"1. Studies on eight patients were performed to clarify the mechanism(s) of altered sodium metabolism and volume regulation in SIADH. The mechanism controlling water excretion was also studied to determine whether there is evidence that altered osmoregulation may be the basis for inappropriate ADH secretion in some patients. 2. These studies show that cumulative sodium balance and aldosterone secretion rates in patients with SIADH are negatively correlated with water intake. There is also a negative correlation between aldosterone secretion and urinary sodium excretion. In the absence of normal urine diluting ability, this increased excretion of sodium becomes a mechanism that allows an increased quantity of water to be excreted despite the persistence of an ADH effect on the renal tubules. 3. Within the range of hyponatremia observed in our studies, changes in serum sodium concentration were accounted for by changes in solute and water balance. One patient, who was potassium deficient during the studies, retained large quantities of sodium and potassium that could not be accounted for by an increase in either serum osmolality or body weight. These observations suggest that intracellular osmotically active solute is either lost or ""inactivated"" in some manner as intracellular potassium is replenished. 4. Marked impairment of urine diluting ability was demonstrated in all patients. However, two patients with SIADH associated with pulmonary tuberculosis exhibited graded responses to water loading, which suggests that ADH secretion may have been suppressed as serum osmolality was progressively reduced. Whether this can be attributed to a basic alteration or ""re-setting"" or osmoreceptor function, or is merely an indication that greater than normal reductions of serum osmolality are required to inhibit potent nonosmotic stimuli, remains to be determined."

Report of 2 cases and review of the literature.,"Fifty-nine cases of glycyrrhizin (licorice)-induced hypokalemic myopathy (GIHM), 2 females treated in our departments (85 and 73 years old) and 57 cases reported in the literature were studied, and conditions leading to the onset, factors, clinical manifestations, laboratory assessments, muscle biopsy findings, treatment and outcome were discussed. The 59 GIHM cases comprised 32 men, 25 women and 2 patients without record of sex; the average age was 55.2 years. In many cases, conditions leading to the onset of GIHM were habitual licorice ingestion, ingestion of antituberculosis agents containing licorice and long-term ingestion of licorice-containing agents for chronic gastritis, chronic hepatitis or chronic dermatitis. The combined use of hypotensive diuretic agents increased the risk of GIHM in an overwhelming number of cases. The main clinical symptom was flaccid quadriplegia in almost all cases, with muscle pain in 32.2% and peripheral dysesthesia in the extremities, manifested mainly by numbness (27.1%). Laboratory findings included a mean serum K+ value of 1.98 mEq/l (56 GIHM cases), a mean creatine kinase of 5,385.7 IU/l (n = 30), a mean blood aldosterone concentration of 2.92 ng/dl (n = 30; normal: 2.0-13.0 ng/dl) and a mean plasma renin activity of 0.17 ng/ml/h (n = 27; normal: 0.8-4.4 ng/ml/h). Muscle biopsy was performed in 17 of the 59 cases with resultant findings of myopathic changes consisting mainly of phagocytosis, necrotic fibers, vacuolar degeneration, together with sporadic neurogenic changes.

Neither body weight nor body mass index (BMI) was affected in WR 2 patients, but BCM was reduced (31.9 +/- 4.3 vs 35.8 +/- 7.3 kg, P < 0.007) and ECM (31.2 +/- 4.4 vs 28.8 +/- 3.8 kg) as well as ECM-BCM ratio increased (0.99 +/- 0.14 vs 0.83 +/- 0.16, P < 0.001). In contrast to WR classification, diarrhea did not correspond with malnutrition. A loss of BCM (malnutrition) occurred already in otherwise symptomless HIV-infected patients (WR 2). This effect can be measured by tetrapolar impedence analysis but not by body weight or BMI."
CD009647,0,11766083,0,Surgical approach for repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and postoperative respiratory function.,"Good exposure and the minimization of lung and thorax injuries are important objectives of surgery for descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (DTAA). In this study, three surgical approaches for DTAA were compared to assess postoperative respiratory function. The subjects were 21 patients with DTAA, three of whom had a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. The mean age was 61 years, and there were 12 men and 9 women. The causes of aneurysm were atherosclerosis in 16 patients, chronic dissection in 4, and traumatic pseudoaneurysm in 1. All the patients underwent femoro-femoral partial cardiopulmonary bypass. The DTAA was replaced with a prosthetic graft in 18 patients and repaired with a patch graft in 3. Three approaches were selected, namely, posterolateral thoracotomy (PL group, n = 12), median sternotomy combined with anterolateral thoracotomy (M group, n = 5), and spiral incision (S group, n = 4). There were no significant differences in operation time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, intraoperative blood loss volume, or water balance. The duration of respiratory support and intensive care unit stay were significantly (P < 0.05) longer in the M group than in the other two groups. The alveolararterial oxygen difference (AaDO2) and respiratory index (RI) levels immediately after surgery were also significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the M group than in the PL group. There were no significant differences in AaDO2 and RI levels 12 and 24h after surgery among the three groups. These results suggest that posterolateral thoracotomy is a desirable surgical approach for DTAA repair in view of the fact that it has the least effect on postoperative respiratory function."

CD009647,0,8223524,0,Determination of capillary leakage due to recombinant interleukin-2 by means of noninvasive conductivity measurements.,"One of the most common side effects of treatment with recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) is capillary leakage. Its genesis is not completely understood. The aim of the study was to determine whether capillary leakage can be monitored by means of a noninvasive conductivity technique and to study its starting point. Eight patients with advanced renal cell cancer were studied in a medium care section of the Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital over 4 days during treatment sessions of continuous, intravenously administered IL-2 (mean dose of 15.6 x 10(6) IU.m-2.day-1). The fluid shift from the intravascular to the extra- and intracellular compartments was monitored by means of noninvasive conductivity measurements. Changes in blood volume were calculated from serial erythrocyte counts. The clinical parameters of capillary leakage (oliguria, positive fluid balance, and gain in mass) were recorded. The mean gain in mass was 9% after 4 days of IL-2 treatment. The extracellular fluid volume increased significantly [46 (SD 23.2)%; P < 0.01], whereas the intracellular fluid volume did not change. The increase in blood volume (BV) amounted to 7% (P < 0.05). The decline in albumin concentration was significantly more than the increase in BV [38 (SD 4.3)%; P < 0.01], indicating capillary albumin leakage. The main changes were observed after the 2nd day of treatment. From this study, it is suggested that conductivity measurements are a suitable method to monitor capillary leakage induced by IL-2, and could be used to detect the exact onset and severity of this leakage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,7056467,0,Evaluation of rapid colonoscopy preparation using a new gut lavage solution.,"The traditional colonoscopy preparation of laxatives and enemas requires 2 days to complete and is occasionally unsatisfactory. The alternative method, gut lavage with saline-based solutions, is hazardous in elderly or compromised patients because of overhydration. We studied a new, orally ingested electrolyte solution containing sodium sulfate and polyethylene glycol as preparation for elective colonoscopy in a consecutive series of 43 patients. Almost all patients achieved a good to excellent preparation. There were no changes in fluid or electrolyte balance and no complications of the procedure. Colonoscopy preparation with this technique is rapid, effective, and well tolerated and is a safe alternative to the standard approach."
CD009647,0,12045547,0,Significance of intraabdominal compartment pressures following TRAM flap breast reconstruction and the correlation of results.,"Abdominal wall closure after transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap breast reconstruction is often performed under considerable tension and may theoretically cause a component of abdominal compartment syndrome. This prospective study examined intraabdominal pressure after TRAM reconstruction and correlated the findings with clinical course and outcome. All patients who underwent pedicled TRAM flap breast reconstruction from November of 1999 to December of 2000 (n = 77) were included and compared with nonoperative controls (n = 24). Intraabdominal pressures were measured indirectly using the urinary catheter in the postanesthesia care unit on postoperative days 1 and 2. Outcome measures included vital signs, urinary output, net 24-degree fluid balance, and complications. The preoperative variables were age, body mass index, parity, and presence of an epidural. For statistical analysis, the TRAM patients were divided into three groups on the basis of type of closure (bipedicle, unipedicle, and mesh), which were compared by analysis of variance. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for patients with intraabdominal pressures > or =20 mmHg who were thought to have a component of abdominal compartment syndrome. The incidence of complications was compared by chi-square, with statistical significance determined for p < 0.05. Average intraabdominal pressures were significantly higher in the bipedicled TRAM (14.1 mmHg) and unipedicle TRAM (9.9 mmHg) groups when compared with the mesh group (5 mmHg) and controls (3.7 mmHg; p < 0.001). Increased intraabdominal pressure was transient and peaked on postoperative day 1. Elevated pressure was associated with decreased urinary output, decreased net fluid balance, and increased respiratory rate. Patients with intraabdominal pressures > or =20 mmHg (n = 10) had a higher incidence of complications (60 percent) compared with patients who had pressures <20 mmHg (18 percent; p < 0.05). Elevated intraabdominal pressures were strongly associated with donor-site and general complications. Positive predictive factors for elevated pressure included body mass index and type of closure (bipedicled or bilateral). Multiple pregnancies seemed to have a protective effect.A transient component of abdominal compartment syndrome does exist after TRAM flap breast reconstruction. Bipedicle closure, nulliparous women, and increased body mass index were risk factors for elevated intraabdominal pressures. Tension-free mesh closure seemed to have a protective effect. Symptomatic trends and certain complications were associated with, and possibly explained by, an elevated intraabdominal pressure."

CD009647,0,1898434,0,The effect of caffeine on postprandial hypotension in the elderly.,"In a double-blind, randomized trial the effects of caffeinated and decaffeinated drinks on postprandial hemodynamic and neurohumoral changes were studied in seven fit, elderly subjects after a standard 2.4MJ meal. There was a significant difference in supine postprandial systolic blood pressure between the placebo and caffeine phases (P less than 0.01); at 60 minutes, supine systolic blood pressure had fallen 14 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI)-7 to-21 mmHg, p less than 0.01) after placebo, but was unchanged after caffeine (+9 mmHg, CI 0 to 18 mmHg, NS]. Similar differences between placebo and caffeine were seen in erect systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01), although orthostatic tolerance was maintained throughout each study period. Postprandial plasma noradrenaline levels were higher (P less than 0.02) and the increase greater (P less than 0.02) after caffeine than after placebo. Caffeine administered at the end of a standard test meal prevents the postprandial fall in blood pressure in fit, elderly subjects. The clinical relevance of this finding has yet to be determined, but it may offer a simple remedy for patients with symptomatic postprandial hypotension."
CD009647,0,3282466,0,New issues in geriatric care.,"The rapid growth of the elderly population has increased the need for improved geriatric care and prevention of disability. For example, the prevalence and severity of osteoporosis can be reduced significantly by the use of estrogen, with or without added progestin, in postmenopausal women. A common and devastating problem of frail elderly persons is urinary incontinence, most cases of which can be classified without referral for urologic services. Appropriate treatment can improve nearly half of all cases of persistent incontinence. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is effective in guiding the treatment of frail elderly patients and leads to significantly improved outcomes under appropriate conditions. The advent of the teaching nursing home has shed light on the medical problems of elderly residents of nursing homes, including malnutrition, dysregulation of water and electrolyte balance, falling, cognitive and affective illnesses, behavior disturbances, infections, and pathogenic drug use. The future application of advanced technology may revolutionize nursing home care."
CD009647,0,2406645,0,Aging and disturbances of thirst and fluid balance.,"Fluid and electrolyte homeostasis depend on a balance between the intake and output of water. Aging is characterized by reduced homeostatic capacity. Changes in the control of both water intake and excretion accompany aging and may predispose the elderly to disturbances in sodium and water balance. Reduced thirst and water intake in response to water deprivation and thermal dehydration have been observed in healthy elderly persons. This reduction, combined with reduced renal water-conservation capacity, may predispose the elderly to dangerous dehydration when illness increases water losses or physical incapacity prevents access to water. The reasons for the thirst deficit are not clear. The elderly have a reduced capacity to excrete a water load, which means they are predisposed to water overload and hyponatremia. Furthermore, various neuroendocrine changes in the elderly affect fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. More studies are needed to understand the etiology of the disturbances of fluid intake and output so that they can be better prevented and treated."

CD009647,0,10865710,0,"Total body dual X-ray absorptiometry is a good measure of both fat mass and fat-free mass in liver cirrhosis compared to ""gold-standard"" techniques. Melbourne Liver Group.","Liver cirrhosis is a condition in which overnutrition, edema, and undernutrition can coexist simultaneously, or successively, over a period of time, giving rise to alterations in body composition, as well as systemic and multiorgan manifestations. We undertook a cross-sectional study of body composition in 198 adult patients with liver cirrhosis (140 males, mean age 53.6, range 31-85 years; and 58 females, mean age 58.4, range 36-79 years). The patients had cirrhosis of differing etiology and different stages of severity. They were gathered from seven different hospital clinics in the city of Melbourne, Australia, but all the body composition measurements were performed in one body composition laboratory. A variety of body composition techniques were used to identify which commonly available ones could best assess both fat-free mass and fat mass relative to a criterion ""gold-standard"" method available in a specialist laboratory. A gold-standard fat-free mass (FFMGS) was defined as the sum of total body protein, measured by in vivo neutron activation analysis (IVNA), plus total body water, measured by D2O dilution, plus bone mineral content, measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). A gold-standard fat mass (FATGS) was defined as the difference between body weight and FFMGS. ""Usual"" fat mass and fat-free mass were defined by different techniques including DXA, anthropometry (ANT), single-frequency bioelectrical impedance (SFBIA), multiple-frequency bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (MFBIA), and whole body gamma counting (TBK). The FFMGS was overhydrated in both sexes, relative to the usual value of 0.73, but women were significantly overhydrated compared to men. Relative to the gold-standard deuterium oxide dilution method for measuring total body water, SFBIA slightly overestimated TBW, whereas MFBIA slightly underestimated TBW, with both methods having wide limits of agreement for any single estimate. In comparing FFM to FFMGS, only DXA showed a small negative bias, in both males and females, with modest limits of agreement for any single estimate. All other methods showed a large negative bias (ANT, SFBIA, and MFBIA) or a large positive bias (TBK) relative to FFMGS, with wide limits of agreement. In comparing FAT with the FATGS, only DXA showed a small positive bias, in both males and females, with modest limits of agreement for any single estimate. All other methods showed a large positive bias (ANT, SFBIA, and MFBIA) or a large negative bias (TBK) relative to FATGS, with wide limits of agreement. In cirrhosis, DXA is a good and widely available method to assess both fat mass and fat-free mass. However, it cannot give information about the quality of the FFM, particularly its water content. The bedside methods of anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance, both SFBIA and MFBIA, are poor methods of measuring body composition in patients with liver cirrhosis, whereas whole body gamma counting, although not widely available, also significantly differs from the gold-standard method of assessment of fat-free mass and fat mass in liver cirrhosis."
CD009647,0,7737531,0,Body measurements of black and white elderly persons with emphasis on body composition.,"The measurements obtained on 103 male and female subjects, 60-103 years of age, who were participants in a community nutrition program, included weight, height, knee height, body mass index, triceps skinfold, midarm circumference, midarm muscle area, total body fat, total body water, and lean body mass. Over the 43-year range of this cross-sectional study, 78% of body weight loss in men and 51% in women was attributable to lean tissue, while fat tissue accounted for 22% of weight loss in men and 53% in women. Analysis of variance of the measured values over the age interval showed trends that were not statistically significant among males, but females showed significant decreases in weight, body mass index, triceps skinfold, midarm muscle area, total body fat (% and lb), total body water (l), and lean body mass; also, a significant increase in total body water (%) was observed in females. Ethnic differences among the parameters included higher triceps skinfold in white than in black males and larger knee height and midarm circumference in white than in black females. Comparison of parameters by gender within each ethnic group showed larger body weight and midarm muscle area in white males than in white females; triceps skinfold was larger in black females than in black males. t tests indicated that subjects who received home-delivered meals had significantly smaller mean body weight, body mass index, triceps skinfold, midarm circumference and total body fat (% and lb) than those who came to a senior center for the noon meal. Elderly who lived alone had a higher total body fat (%) than those who lived with other(s). In females, significant correlation coefficients (r) were shown by weight, total body water (l), and lean body mass with all parameters. The weakest r values in females were those for height and for triceps skinfold with other parameters. In males, there was no single parameter that correlated with all others; triceps skinfold correlated with none. The strongest correlations in the male were for weight with total body water and with lean body mass, and for midarm circumference with midarm muscle area."

The present study aimed to assess the possibility that brief low-calorie, low-protein parenteral fluid regimen after relatively moderate surgical trauma can modify the muscle metabolism and alter the water, electrolyte and protein composition. Well-nourished patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy were studied. During the first four postoperative days, seven patients (group I) received parenteral nutrition adequate as regards water, sodium and potassium but deficient in carbohydrates and without amino acids, while six patients (group II) had adequate parenteral supply of calories and nitrogen. The extracellular balance in regard to water, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and urea was assessed in all 13 patients. Needle biopsy of muscle was performed during surgery and at the end of the observation period in six patients from group I and five from group II, in order to assess the total and the intracellular and extracellular water content and also sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus and alkali-soluble protein nitrogen. In group I, but not in group II, there was weight loss and negative extracellular balance of all parameters, in particular potassium and nitrogen, and reduction of muscle potassium. The analyses of balance and of muscle cell composition showed considerable loss of lean body mass and indicated 'true' electrolyte disturbance, although clinical symptoms were absent and serum parameters remained normal."

CD009647,0,17160631,0,Acute renal failure in the elderly: particular characteristics.,"Elderly individuals comprise the faster growing patient population group and acute renal failure (ARF) is quite common among them, although exact numbers are not known. We reviewed the literature with regards to the characteristics of ARF in elderly patients and describe some useful guidelines. The ageing kidney is characterized by many structural and functional changes, which are mainly due to various chronic disorders, such as hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis, which are highly prevalent in these patients. A number of structural and functional changes characteristic of the ageing kidney make elderly people especially prone to renal damage. ARF in the elderly is frequently of multifactorial origin and often with an atypical presentation, like the ""intermediate syndrome"", which combines characteristics of pre-renal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis. Physical examination and laboratory blood and urine indices may sometimes be misleading occasionally leading to misdiagnosis. Prophylaxis remains the preferred approach to therapy: one should avoid nephrotoxic drugs and poly-pharmacy, adjust drug doses and achieve adequate hydration of the patient as cautiously as possible. Dialysis therapies can be used for treatment of ARF irrespective of age and carry a good prognosis."
CD009647,0,3177084,0,Hypothesis: posture is one of the determinants of the circadian rhythm of urine flow and electrolyte excretion in elderly female patients.,"In view of recent investigations suggesting that the circadian rhythm of urine output is reversed in the elderly, the present study was designed to see if increased urine flow at night may be related to change in posture. Urine flow, urea and electrolyte excretion were measured 4-hourly for 6 consecutive days and nights in four catheterized female patients, mean age 83 years. Two were nursed in chairs for 8 h daily for 3 days, followed by total bed-rest for 3 days, and the other two in reverse order. None of the patients showed the morning rise of water and electrolyte excretion which has been described in young people. On full bed-rest, there was no significant day-night difference in water, sodium, potassium, urea or creatinine excretion. Chair nursing produced a negative mean day-night difference in water excretion (-321 ml: P less than 0.001) and in sodium (-11.7 mmol: P less than 0.002), urea (-26.6 mmol: P = 0.005) and creatinine excretion (-0.6 mmol: P = 0.008), but had no significant effect on potassium excretion. These results suggest that sitting upright may have important effects on water and electrolyte balance in elderly patients and may contribute to nocturia and nocturnal incontinence."
CD009647,0,1114974,0,Left-axis deviation: etiologic factors in one-hundred patients.,"Clinical and electrocardiographic findings were analyzed in 100 consecutive cases of LAD. Below the age of forty years, LAD was uncommon, but its incidence increased continuously thereafter. The most frequent primary clinical diagnosis was arteriosclerotic heart disease. The functional mechanism producing LAD most often was LAHB, responsible in about 40 per cent. Approximately half the instances of LAHB were associated with old myocardial infarction of septal, anterior, or lateral regions, but half were seen in the absence of infarction or clinical coronary sclerosis and are presumed due to primary degenerative processes within these specialized conducting fibers. Approximately one-sixth of the instances of LAD were due to loss of inferior forces following inferior myocardial infarction. Typical left ventricular hypertrophy was a distinctly uncommon cause of LAD. Last, in 24 patients with LAD the mechanism or cause was not evident initially, of which two were subsequently shown to represent a very mild degree of LAHB. Also it is suggested that asymmetric myocardial hypertrophy of the anterior wall may account for some instances of LAD not otherwise explained."
CD009647,0,12230298,0,Dietary electrolytes and hypertension in the elderly.,"The effect of age on older hypertensive patient's blood pressure response to increased sodium intake is well known. Salt sensitivity which does increase with age and the decrease in renal function limiting the ability of aged kidney to excrete sodium load are major factors, responsible for rise in blood pressure during Na consumption in the elderly. Clinical studies encourage salt reduction with and without weight loss. Although potassium consumption is highly recommended, one should be aware of potassium overload in the elderly."
CD009647,0,6819545,0,Changes in body composition of cancer patients following combined nutritional support.,"The effects of combined nutritional support (parenteral, enteral, and oral) were measured in cancer patients unable to maintain normal alimentation. Changes in body composition were quantified by measurement of total body levels of nitrogen, potassium, water, and fat. The protein-calorie intake of the patients was also evaluated by dietary survey (4-day recall). Standard anthropometric and biochemical measurements for nutritional assessment were obtained for comparison. The dietary evaluation indicated that the dietary supplementation for all patients was more than adequate to meet their energy requirements. Almost all patients gained weight on the combined nutritional support regimens. Determination of body composition indicated that change in body weight was equal to the sum of the changes in body protein, total body water, and total body fat. The findings from the anthropometric nutrition indices (arm muscle circumference and triceps skinfold) were consistent with the results of the body composition study. Information on the nature of the tissue gained was obtained by comparison of body composition data with the ratio of protein:water:lean body mass for normal tissue. The mean gain of protein in the cancer patients was quite small (0.3-0.6 kg). The main change in body weight appeared to be the result of gains in body water and body fat. The total body nitrogen to potassium ratio served to define the extent of tissue anabolism following hyperalimentation. The ratio dropped in the cancer patients following hyperalimentation toward the value of the control subjects on ad libidum diets. The body compartment techniques described have demonstrated their usefulness in determining the effects of hyperalimentation on cancer patients."
CD009647,0,831006,0,Antidiuretic hormone levels during cardiopulmonary bypass.,"The effect of CPB on plasma ADH levels, urine flow, and urine osmolality was studied in nine patients. All patients received morphine, 1 mg. per kilogram, and 50 per cent nitrous oxide-50 per cent oxygen for anesthesia. CPB utilized a Travenol disposable bubble oxygenator and the prime consisted of 3 L. of Ringer's lactate. Measurements were made prior to induction of anesthesia , at 30 minutes following surgical incision, and at 15, 30, and 45 minutes during CPB. There were no statistically significant changes in mean arterial BP, cardiac index, serum sodium, or serum osmolality in any period. Urine flow increased from 0.99 +/- 0.3 ml. per minute to a high of 6.13 +/- 2.0 ml. per minute at 30 minute at 30 minutes on CPB (P less than 0.02). Urine osmolality declined from a control value of 691 +/- 142 mOsm. per kilogram to a low of 425 +/- 48 mOsm. per kilogram at 45 minutes on CPB (p less than 0.05). ADH levels rose from a control value of 4.3 +/- 1.5 to 13.0 +/- 3.3 pg. per milliliter with surgical stimulatiion (p less than 0.05). During CPB the ADH levels rose to a peak of 23.7 +/- 3.6 pg. per milliliter at 30 minutes (p less than 0.01) and were declining at 45 minutes. These data suggest that the stress of CPB results in an outpouring of ADH (or vasopressin) to function as a pressor to produce an increase in peripheral resistance. The ADH concentrations far exceed those required for normal physiologic control of water excretion and the urineflow will thus vary more with the hemodynamic changes than with the ADH levels."

An increase in plasma volume was noted during oestrogen treatment and a slight transitory rise in plasma volume was also seen after orchidectomy. During cyproterone acetate therapy there was a reduction of body weight and a transitory increase in 24-hour urine volume and urinary sodium excretion. The increase in plasma volume during oestrogen treatment might tax the circulatory capacity. Cyproterone acetate treatment does not change the salt-water balance or the plasma volume in such a way that the risk of congestive heart failure could be increased.
CD009647,0,1467074,0,Effect of diclofenac on renal function and prostacyclin generation after surgery.,"We have examined the effect of diclofenac on renal function after major surgery in a randomized, double-blind, controlled study of 20 patients undergoing oesophagogastrectomy. Diclofenac 75 mg or placebo was given i.m. 12-hourly for 2 days. I.v. fluid administration was standardized. Renal function was assessed by fluid balance and measurement of serum creatinine and electrolyte concentrations, creatinine and free water clearance, and urinary sodium and potassium excretion. Urinary 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) was measured by radioimmunoassay to assess renal prostacyclin production. After surgery, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production increased, but this did not occur with diclofenac. On the first day after surgery, use of diclofenac was associated with a decreased urine flow rate, decreased urinary sodium and potassium excretion and a tendency to hyperkalaemia. Frusemide was required more often in the diclofenac group. One patient was withdrawn from the diclofenac group because of impaired renal function. Urine flow rate and blood potassium concentration should be monitored if diclofenac is used after major surgery."
CD009647,0,14571940,0,Walking in a vacuum-assisted socket shifts the stump fluid balance.,"Gains in stump volume have been documented in trans-tibial amputees while walking in custom made under-sized, total surface-bearing, vacuum-assisted sockets (Board et al., 2001). These gains raised doubts as to whether the sockets were truly under-sized and concerns that using an over-sized socket with vacuum-assist could lead to swelling, resulting, in discomfort or pain. The purposes of the present study were to determine if: (a) walking in a vacuum-assisted socket causes the stump to retain or gain volume in excess of the available socket volume and (b) the resulting increase in stump volume with an over-sized socket causes discomfort, pain, and/or the skin to redden. The results of this study showed the stump retained or gained volume in excess of the available socket volume while walking in vacuum-assisted sockets of various sizes. The stump lost less volume than predicted, or gained volume, in under-sized sockets. It also gained more volume than predicted in over-sized sockets. No discomfort, pain, or skin reddening, resulting from the volume gain was reported by any of the subjects after walking in an over-sized socket.

CD009647,0,8297564,0,"Cardiovascular response during hemodialysis and hemofiltration: thermal, membrane, and catecholamine influences.","Nine patients on regular dialysis were studied, in a cross-over format comparing hemodialysis (HD) and hemofiltration (HF), to identify potential mechanisms of the disparate hemodynamic responses. Dialysis and substitution fluid composition (high sodium, acetate), treatment time, fluid loss rate, and membrane type (AN 69) were matched. Cardiac output was determined by changes in thoracic electrical bioimpedance. Cardiac output remained stable during HF but increased during HD (p < 0.001, HD vs. HF), despite a parallel reduction in stroke volume. The heart rate response was significantly greater during HD relative to HF (p < 0.01). Systemic vascular resistance remained stable during HF but decreased significantly during HD (p < 0.05). Although there was a modest fall during HD, the difference in blood pressure at the end of treatment between HD and HF was not significant. Comparable increases in body temperature were observed during both treatments. Plasma catecholamines increased in parallel during HD and HF and following orthostatic stimulation at the end of treatment, and extracorporeal catecholamine clearances were similar. The values for serum sodium, total CO2, anion gap, potassium, and hematocrit at the end of treatment were similar, whereas total serum calcium was significantly greater following HD. There were no significant differences in indices of myocardial contractility or central blood volume. These results suggest that the disparate hemodynamic responses to fluid and solute removal during HD and HF can be dissociated from changes in osmolality or venous tone, membrane bioincompatibility, thermal stress, or differences in acetate delivery or catecholamine release. The explanation for the disparate hemodynamic responses between these two treatment modalities remains unclear. A role for an as yet unidentified vasodilatory substance generated during dialysate exposure, or convectively removed during hemofiltration, remain intriguing possibilities."

CD009647,0,9719243,0,Autopsy case of duodenal obstruction from impacted mushroom.,"We report an autopsy case of duodenal bulb obstruction caused by a shiitake mushroom. A 74-year-old woman with depression was admitted to the hospital after suffering nausea and abdominal fullness for 3 days. Because the physical findings and laboratory data on admission revealed marked dehydration, lactated Ringer's solution was administered. Twelve hours later, the patient suddenly died. Autopsy showed an enlarged stomach filled with 850 ml of partially digested food. In the anal side of the pylorus, a 9-cm-diameter shiitake mushroom had become impacted, causing complete obstruction. We conclude that the patient suffered from duodenal bulb obstruction caused by the impacted mushroom and subsequently died of ileus. This case illustrates a rare cause of duodenal obstruction and emphasizes that ingested food can cause obstructive ileus and death."
CD009647,0,1987247,0,Is routine preoperative hemodynamic evaluation of nonagenarians necessary?,"An Incidence of co-morbid cardiac disease in the elderly surgical patient as high as 66% has been previously reported. Even in the absence of clinically significant cardiac disease, advanced age alone is often considered sufficient indication for Swan-Ganz placement, hemodynamic evaluation, adjustment of fluid states, and inotropic support. Yet data clearly documenting the need for this evaluation and therapy are difficult to obtain. All major general surgical and orthopedic operations in non-agenarians were reviewed in our institution from July 1, 1987 through December 31, 1988. Fifty-one procedures were performed on 46 patients. None of these patients had preoperative Swan-Ganz catheterization or hemodynamic evaluation. Eighteen general surgical, 30 orthopedic, 2 neurosurgical, and 1 gynecological procedures were performed. Forty-three were performed under general anesthesia, 7 under spinal anesthesia, and 1 with local anesthesia. Seven out of 51 patients (14%) experienced major complications, and 16 out of 51 (31%) experienced minor complications. Thirty-day mortality was 0%, and 6-month survival was 92%. Only one complication occurred within 48 hours of surgery that might possibly have been prevented with hemodynamic evaluation, adjustment of fluid status, inotropic support, and intensive care unit monitoring."
CD009647,0,19533166,0,Proximal electrode placement improves the estimation of body composition in obese and lean elderly during segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis.,"Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is an affordable, non-invasive, easy-to-operate, and fast alternative method to assess body composition. However, BIA tends to overestimate the percent body fat (%BF) in lean elderly and underestimate %BF in obese elderly people. This study examined whether proximal electrode placement eliminates this problem. Forty-two elderly men and women (64-96 years) who had a wide range of BMI [22.4 +/- 3.3 kg/m(2) (mean +/- SD), range 16.8-33.9 kg/m(2)] and %BF (11.3-44.8%) participated in this study. Using (2)H and (18)O dilutions as the criterion for measuring total body water (TBW), we compared various BIA electrode placements; wrist-to-ankle, arm-to-arm, leg-to-leg, elbow-to-knee, five- and nine-segment models, and the combination of distal (wrists or ankles) and proximal (elbows or knees) electrodes. TBW was most strongly correlated with the square height divided by the impedance between the knees and elbows (H(2)/Z (proximal); r = 0.965, P < 0.001). In the wrist-to-ankle, arm-to-arm, leg-to-leg, and five-segment models, we observed systematic errors associated with %BF (P < 0.05). After including the impedance ratio of the proximal to distal segments (P/D) as an independent variable, none of the BIA methods examined showed any systematic bias against %BF. In addition, all methods were able to estimate TBW more accurately (e.g., in the wrist-to-ankle model, from R(2) = 0.90, SEE = 1.69 kg to R(2) = 0.94, SEE = 1.30 kg). The results suggest that BIA using distal electrodes alone tends to overestimate TBW in obese and underestimate TBW in lean subjects, while proximal electrodes improve the accuracy of body composition measurements."
CD009647,0,3757023,0,Quantitative effects of osmotic diuresis following angiographic contrast administration.,"Osmotic diuresis resulting from the administration of angiographic contrast poses the potential threat of marked volume losses obligated by the renal excretion of non-reabsorbable solute. We prospectively assessed urinary excretion of solute and water following cardiac angiography in 14 euvolemic subjects without preexisting renal disease, by a protocol that allowed each patient to serve as his own control. During the initial 6 h after the beginning of angiography, contrast administration resulted in increased total osmolar excretion from a control rate of 0.79 +/- 0.09 to 1.09 +/- 0.09 mOsm/min (P less than .05) with a return to control values thereafter. Surprisingly, sodium, potassium, and chloride excretion rates did not differ significantly from control values. After subtraction of the molar contribution of electrolytes, urea, and creatinine from the total osmolar excretion rate, it was apparent that the ""residual osmolar excretion rate"" of 0.48 +/- 0.05 mOsm/min was markedly elevated over the control value of 0.11 +/- 0.05 mOsm/min (P less than .01), reflecting the excretion of contrast agent. Despite the marked osmotic diuresis, urine output during this period (3.9 +/- 0.2 cc/min) did not differ significantly from the control value of 4.0 +/- 0.3 cc/min. We conclude that marked volume losses are not a necessary concomitant of contrast-induced osmotic diuresis in the euvolemic cardiac patient without renal disease."
CD009647,0,474187,0,Renal function and plasma aldosterone during acute lithium intoxication.,"Studies on plasma aldosterone, total serum protein, electrolytes, osmolal concentrations in serum and urine, creatinine, lithium and osmolal clearances were carried out on 14 patients suffering from lithium intoxication. The determinations were done on samples obtained on admission and during the following twelve days of treatment with hemodialysis, sodium chloride loading, or forced diuresis. Plasma aldosterone and total serum protein were increased; serum sodium concentrations and creatinine clearances were decreased on admission. Serum osmolality was normal; urine osmolal concentration was just above that in plasma. The results showed that the lithium intoxicated patients were moderately depleted of sodium and water on admission. Plasma aldosterone, total serum protein and serum sodium were normalized during treatment. Creatinine clearance increased but did not normalize in all patients. Renal concentrating tests were performed in five patients three to four weeks after lithium intoxication. The renal concentrating ability was reduced in all. The elevated plasma aldosterone seen in lithium intoxication might have been a result of sodium and water depletion. It is suggested that impaired renal concentrating ability induced by lithium may make some patients more susceptible to conditions which can lead to sodium and water loss, and thereby to lithium intoxication."
CD009647,0,7894520,0,Changes in fat free mass in overweight patients with rheumatoid arthritis on a weight reducing regimen. A comparison of eight different body composition methods.,"The aim of this work was to compare and validate seven different methods for estimating changes in fat free mass, in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. Measurements were made of fat and fat free mass before and after 12 weeks on an energy restricted, protein rich diet and physical training. The subjects were sixteen female and three male overweight out-patients (mean body mass index at baseline: 30 kg/m2) suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, according to the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association. Fat free mass was estimated by eight different body composition methods (a four-compartment model, total body water, total body potassium, impedance, near infrared interactance, creatinine excretion, body mass index and skinfold measurements). Mean weight loss was 2.7 kg fat and 1.7 kg fat free mass. There was no difference between measurements of mean change in fat free mass by the four-compartment model and the other methods, except for the creatinine method (P = 0.03). Compared to the four-compartment method, the total body water method gave the most accurate estimate of individual fat free mass changes (residual Mean Square: 0.4 kg), second to this method, the impedance method, seemed most valid (residual Mean Square: 0.8 kg). Accuracies of the other methods were lower (residual Mean Square between 4.2 and 8.2 kg [corrected]). Of eight methods for estimating changes in FFM, the TBW method gave the most accurate estimate of individual FFM changes, compared to a four-compartment model used as reference.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,21817820,0,Effect of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 on blood loss and coagulation in patients with recent exposure to dual antiplatelet therapy undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery.,"Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions are often used for maintaining intravascular volume and improving microperfusion, while a large amount of HES can cause adverse effects on coagulation. As the indications for clopidogrel expand, an increasing number of patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) are also undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), with its higher risk of bleeding complications. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a moderate dose of 6% HES 130/0.4 significantly increases perioperative blood loss in patients with continued DAPT within 5 days of OPCAB."

In this work some clinical data, blood tests and strumental considerations are described. IMA is a vascular emergency with severe prognosis and high rate morbidity and mortality, often correlated to a diagnostic delay. The discrepancy between symptoms and clinical objectivity must suggest the suspect, especially in patients with cardiac pathology, short lasting diarrhoea, bowel hemorrhage or only abdominal pain rebel to the analgesics; with the laboratory indexes and strumental data it can be carried out an early diagnosis and then begin the more opportune therapeutical treatment. The increase of blood sugar together to the triad leucocytosis--haemoconcentration and metabolic acidosis, in previously non diabetic patients, confirm the suspect of IMA in the very initial phases of this pathology."
CD009647,0,12395330,0,Pharmacodynamic effects of a nonpeptide antidiuretic hormone V2 antagonist in cirrhotic patients with ascites.,"Water retention and dilutional hyponatremia, mainly attributable to an impairment of free water excretion and increased vasopressin activity, are well-documented complications in cirrhotic patients with ascites. VPA-985 is a selective, nonpeptide, orally active, vasopressin-2-receptor antagonist. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacodynamics, safety, and pharmacokinetics of ascending single doses (25, 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg) in cirrhotic patients with ascites in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Each dose level was studied in 5 patients (4 active and 1 placebo). After an overnight fast and fluid restriction (continued for 4 hours after dose administration), all patients were given placebo on baseline day and an oral suspension of VPA or placebo on the following day. VPA produced a significant dose-related increase in daily urine output (1,454 +/- 858 mL to 4,568 +/- 4,385 mL with VPA 300 mg) and a dose-related decrease in urine osmolality. The free water clearance reached greater than 3 mL/min for doses 100 mg or greater. Simultaneously, significant increases in serum osmolality, sodium, and vasopressin levels were found. There was a significant increase in sodium urine excretion. VPA was rapidly absorbed and maximum serum concentrations were achieved within 1 hour after administration. Elimination half-life ranged from 9.0 hours after 100 mg to 22.6 hours after 200 mg. In conclusion, VPA induced a dose-related aquaretic response, suggesting a therapeutic potential in managing water retention in patients with liver cirrhosis with ascites."

Alterations were much earlier and more frequent in the pre-ascitic stage. A fall in arterial blood O2 tension also proved a poor prognostic factor. The water load test and 24-hr determination of natriuria best reflected the clinical picture and should thus act as pointers to the correct planning of treatment."
CD009647,0,1822757,0,Regulation of vasopressin release in moderately severe essential hypertension.,"Vasopressin plasma concentrations have been measured in two groups of subjects, 13 moderate essential hypertensive patients without target organ damage and eight control normotensive subjects, before and after the assumption of the upright position, and intravenous infusions of hypotonic saline (0.45% NaCl, 0.25 ml kg-1 min-1 for 1 h) and hypertonic saline (100 mmol NaCl in 50 ml). Plasma vasopressin in recumbent baseline conditions was not significantly different in the two groups. Upright posture and hypertonic challenge augmented, while hypotonic saline reduced plasma vasopressin levels, which were not significantly different between the two groups. Plasma renin activity increased in the upright position, was reduced by administration of hypotonic saline and unaffected by hypertonic saline, with no differences between the hypertensives and normotensives. After hypertonic saline, urinary flow rate and urinary sodium excretion in the hypertensive group increased to values significantly (p less than 0.05) higher than in normotensive subjects. In conclusion our study excludes significant alteration of vasopressin regulation in moderate uncomplicated hypertension. In hypertensives although the response of vasopressin to an osmotic load is preserved, the data suggest that the renal handling of the osmotic load may be altered."
CD009647,0,9626140,0,Glucocorticoids suppress corticotropin-releasing hormone and vasopressin expression in human hypothalamic neurons.,"Glucocorticoids are widely used in clinical practice in a variety of immune-mediated and neoplastic diseases, mostly for their immunosuppressive, leukopenic, antiedematous, or malignancy-suppressive actions. However, their usage is limited because of serious and sometimes life-threatening side-effects. Endogenous glucocorticoids are secreted by the adrenal cortex under the control of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. This hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, in turn, is under the negative feedback control of glucocorticoids. Although the suppression of adrenocortical and pituitary gland functions by glucocorticoids has been shown in humans, a feedback effect at the level of the hypothalamus, as shown in rat, has not been reported to date. The present study shows for the first time that glucocorticoids suppress both CRH and vasopressin (AVP) in the human hypothalamus. We studied immunocytochemically the postmortem hypothalami of nine corticosteroid-exposed subjects and eight controls. The number of CRH-expressing cells in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus of glucocorticoid-exposed patients was only 3.3% of that in the controls, and the total immunoreactivities for AVP were 31% and 33% of that in the controls in the supraoptic nucleus and the paraventricular nucleus, respectively, whereas the immunoreactivity for oxytocin did not differ between the two groups. Suppression of hypothalamic CRH and AVP neurons by glucocorticoids may have important consequences for neuroendocrinological mechanisms such as the disturbance of water balance during the treatment as well as the immunological processes in the brain and the pathogenesis of the withdrawal syndrome after discontinuation of corticosteroid treatment. In addition, as both AVP and CRH neurons also project to other brain structures and influence memory, mood, and behavior, their suppression by glucocorticoids may be responsible for at least part of the central nervous system side-effects of glucocorticoids."

CD009647,0,14556732,0,Hydrocortisone improved haemodynamics and fluid requirement in surviving but not non-surviving of severely burned patients.,"Recent studies have shown that administration of hydrocortisone may lead to a reduction of catecholamines and to an improved outcome in septic patients. However, there are no data on the use of hydrocortisone in burn patients although in these patients reduction of vasopressors might be even more crucial for outcome due to improvement of skin perfusion. This study presents the first results on the impact of hydrocortisone administration in norepinephrine dependent severely burned patients. In a prospective cohort study fourteen consecutive severely burned patients received, 12h after norepinephrine dependency, a hydrocortisone bolus of 100mg followed by 0.18mg/(kgh) hydrocortisone. The course of the necessary norepinephrine dose, as well as the fluid balance was documented 12h prior and after the first dosage of hydrocortisone. Statistical analysis showed an unexpected increase of the required norepinephrine dosage. A statistical post hoc evaluation of surviving and non-surviving patients revealed a significant increase of norepinephrine in non-survivors whereas in survivors it was possible to reduce norepinephrine significantly. Furthermore, the median fluid requirement of surviving patients could be significantly reduced whereas in the group of non-survivors there was no change of volume needed. Our data suggests that hydrocortisone might be useful in selected patients with severe burn injuries. However, patients not responding to hydrocortisone administrations seem to have a poor prognosis. Our findings are in contrast to previously published data on septic patients, in whom hydrocortisone administration resulted in a reduction of norepinephrine. In burned patients the severity of trauma seems to have more profound influence on the pathophysiological mechanism of sepsis. Due to the high number of non-responders, the potential immune suppression and impaired wound healing caused by the side effects of hydrocortisone, further selection criteria seem to be necessary. A short ACTH-test might be considered prior to hydrocortisone administration to select patients who might benefit from this therapy. In summary, further prospective controlled studies will be necessary to establish hydrocortisone in the routine therapy of severely burned patients."

CD009647,0,8613852,0,Neurochemical monitoring using intracerebral microdialysis in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"The authors have developed a method for routine monitoring of disturbances in brain energy metabolism and extracellular levels of excitatory amino acids using intracerebral microdialysis in 10 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Microdialysis was conducted for periods ranging from 6 to 11 days after ictus. Altogether, 16,054 chemical analyses from 1647 dialysate samples were performed. Concentrations of the energy-related substances lactate, pyruvate, glucose, and hypoxanthine were measured, and the lactate/pyruvate ratio was calculated. The excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate were measured. The microdialysis data were matched with computerized tomography findings, clinical course, and outcome. The results support the concepts that microdialysis is a promising tool for chemical monitoring of the human brain and that extracellular fluid levels of lactate, lactate/pyruvate ratio, glucose, hypoxanthine, and glutamate are useful markers of disturbances in brain energy metabolism in neurointensive care patients. These results have generated a working hypothesis that the pattern of these extracellular markers may help differentiate between various causes of energy perturbations, such as hypoxia and different degrees of ischemia. The correlation between the dialysate levels of excitatory amino acids and outcome supports the concept of glutamate receptor overactivation in acute human brain injury."

CD009647,0,2677451,0,[Arrhythmias in the elderly].,"Longitudinal Cohort Study: Electrocardiogram and blood pressure were taken biannually along with history taking, physical examination and other laboratory studies. 6,690 subjects were included in this study in whom at least 7 out of 9 biannual check up examinations were performed. At the end of the study period, their ages ranged from about 40 to 90 years. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was about 0.2% in the forties and early fifties and increased to 0.6% by the late fifties. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was then increased almost linearly up to 2.5% at the end of the eighties. Likewise, incidence of CRBBB and LBBB was also increased with age even after the age of sixty; 1.0% at the fifties to 7.5% at the eighties in CRBBB and 0.05% at the fifties to 1.4% at the eighties in LBBB, respectively. Holter ECG Study: Holter ECG was recorded in 164 healthy subjects aged 14 to 87 years in whom no arrhythmias were found in the routine 12 leads ECG at entry to the study. In 96.9% of the subjects APC was recorded in the 24-hour Holter ECG irrespective of their age. The total number of APCs in 24 hours significantly increased with age, especially after age sixty. The incidence of couplet or short run APCs was 21.4% under age sixty and 74.2% above age sixty. Electrophysiologic Studies in Patients with Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (Paf): Repetitive atrial firing (RAF) elicited by premature atrial stimulation, and prolonged intra-atrial electrogram (PAE) with multiple (more than 7) spikes recorded during sinus rhythm were taken as indicators of atrial vulnerability. RAF and PAE was observed in more than 60% of Paf patients with or without sick sinus syndrome (SSS), but only approximately 25% in the control group (without SSS). It was also noted that in patients with SSS, who were generally of old age, RAF was observed in about 63% even without Paf. These results suggest that the atrial vulnerability might be an expression of the common electrophysiologic properties of the atrial muscle in the elderly with atrial arrhythmias and/or SSS. Syncopal Episodes due to Transient Severe Hyperkalemia in the Elderly: Two patients with mild to moderate chronic renal failure developed transient severe hyperkalemia (9.9, 7.3 mEq/L, respectively), severe sinus bradycardia with sinus arrest and syncopal episodes. These transient findings almost completely improved in a few days by kayexatete and bicarbonate, and temporary back-up atrial pacing. Hyperkalemia was disproportionately severe compared to BUN and serum creatinine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD009647,0,6687972,0,Ocular surface drying and tear film osmolarity in thyroid eye disease.,"Five factors potentially associated with corneal exposure--palpebral fissure width, exophthalmos, blink rate, lagophthalmos, and lid lag--were evaluated in 17 patients with Graves' disease to determine which were associated with ocular surface damage. Multiple regression analysis revealed that increased palpebral fissure width and increased blink rate were both significant predictors of ocular surface damage (as measured by rose Bengal staining). Tear osmolarity and tear film break-up time were measured to determine the type of drying mechanism involved in thyroid eye disease. All eyes examined except one had blink rates adequate to prevent dry-spot formation. Fourteen of 33 eyes had abnormally high tear osmolarity. Increasing palpebral fissure width and increasing blink rate were both significant predictors of elevated osmolarity in tears obtained from the inferior marginal tear strip. We suspect that increased palpebral fissure width accelerates tear film evaporation, thus increasing tear film osmolarity with resultant ocular surface damage."

Use of Hexabrix produced higher urinary iodine concentrations, lower urine volumes at 30 minutes, and excretory urograms significantly better in diagnostic quality, as rated by four independent observers. There was no difference in nephrogram quality between contrast agents. Patients receiving Hexabrix had less of an increase in heart rate and demonstrated a slight rise in mean arterial blood pressure, rather than the biphasic rise then fall seen with Renografin-60. There was no significant change for up to 96 hours after urography in results of hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis, except for an increase of 0.005 in urine specific gravity with Renografin-60. Patients reported significantly less body heat, heat in the injection arm, and overall discomfort with Hexabrix. There was a similar amount of nausea and vomiting in the two groups.

Plasma irANF concentrations (124 +/- 33 pg/ml) were higher (p less than 0.01) than those in age-matched normal subjects (47 +/- 5 pg/ml). Plasma renin activity (PRA 5.9 +/- 2.2 ng/ml/h), aldosterone (18 +/- 7 ng/dl) and norepinephrine (NE, 66 +/- 5 ng/dl) levels were also elevated compared to the age-related normal range. Alpha-hANF infusion for 60 min at 0.036 micrograms/kg/min decreased the mean BP (-14%; p less than 0.05), increased PRA (+179%; p less than 0.05) and plasma NE (+24%; p less than 0.05). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), diuresis and natriuresis were not modified. A subsequent 60-min infusion of alpha-hANF at 0.067 micrograms/kg/min produced a marked fall in mean BP (-26%; p less than 0.001), hemoconcentration (hematocrit +6%; p less than 0.001) despite stable body fluid balance and a further increase in PRA (+350%, p less than 0.005). GFR and ERPF were severely reduced (-55 and -56%, respectively; p less than 0.001), while diuresis and natriuresis were not modified. Plasma aldosterone was unaltered during, but rose (+72%; p less than 0.01) after the cessation of alpha-hANF infusion. Variations in natriuresis during alpha-hANF infusion correlated positively with BP (r = 0.47; p less than 0.01), ERPF (r = 0.53; p less than 0.01) or GFR (r = 0.51; p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Review of therapeutical results among 23 patients treated over a period of 2 years].,"In critically ill patients with acute renal failure and unstable circulation, dialysis employing conventional haemodialysis may prove technically difficult. If, however, continuous arterio-venous haemofiltration is employed, the haemodynamic problems may be overwon but the method does not always provide effective control of azotaemia. Continuous arterio-venous haemodialysis (KAVHD) is a combination of ultrafiltration and dialysis. The efficacy of KAVHD was investigated retrospectively in 23 critically ill patients with acute renal failure and unstable circulation. All of the patients achieved acceptable steady state concentrations for serum creatinine and carbamide. Four out of five patients with hyperkalaemia obtained normal serum potassium after the first 24 hours of treatment with KAVHD. The average filtration volume was 6.1 1/24 hours, sufficient to provide parenteral nutrition and intravenous infusion and to maintain the negative fluid balance simultaneously. Fifteen patients (65%) died during the intensive course of treatment but none died from complications of KAVHD or renal failure. Renal function was reestablished in eight patients and seven of these could be discharged alive. KAVHD is an effective and simple method of treating critically ill patients with acute renal failure and unstable circulation."
CD009647,0,8814322,0,Diagnosis of respiratory virus infections using GACELISA of urinary antibodies.,"Sensitive and specific methods are needed to diagnose respiratory virus infections using body fluids such as urine that, unlike blood samples, are readily obtained by non-invasive means. Immunoglobulin G antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were developed for detection of antibody rises to respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A/Taiwan (H1N1) after initial quantification and adjustment of urinary IgG concentration. Of 24 elderly subjects whose sera were assayed by the complement fixation test for antibody to RSV, seven had convalescent titres > or = 32, and five had > or = 4-fold rises in titre. Acute and convalescent urines for six of these seven subjects were tested for virus-specific urinary IgG by GACELISA. Four of four persons with > or = 4-fold rises in CFT had urine ELISA convalescent to acute ratios of > or = 1.8 whereas two subjects with convalescent CF titres > 16, but no increase in serum antibody titre, had urine convalescent/acute ratios of 1.0. Ten subjects with > or = 4-fold rises in CFT or HI antibodies to influenza A/Taiwan had urine ELISA ratios of > or = 1.4 when samples taken on the day of influenza vaccination and 16 days later were compared. These preliminary observations demonstrate clinically significant rises in respiratory pathogen antibody levels between acute and convalescent urine samples, provided that total urinary IgG concentrations are quantified and then standardised."

CD009647,0,8976813,0,Four-component model of body composition in chronic renal failure comprising dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and measurement of total body water by deuterium oxide dilution.,"1. Assessment of nutrition in patients with chronic renal failure by body composition measurement techniques may be affected by variable hydration. 2. This study aimed to derive a four-component model of body composition (consisting of fat, protein, total body water and body mineral) from a combination of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and total body water measured by deuterium oxide dilution, allowing assessment of body protein stores without the effect of variation in hydration. Patients with chronic renal failure on haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and conservative treatment and a control group were studied. Patients with chronic renal failure were at an 'ideal' state of hydration on clinical assessment. 3. Hydration was defined by total body water as a percentage of fat-free mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and no differences were found between chronic renal failure subgroups and control subjects (except in the female undialysed chronic renal failure subgroup). Hydration was significantly correlated with percentage total body fat in the control groups but not in patients with chronic renal failure. 4. Lean tissue measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was significantly reduced in three of the six chronic renal failure groups compared with control subjects (male and female patients on haemodialysis and female patients on peritoneal dialysis). Protein estimated from the four-component model failed to detect these abnormalities. 5. Lean tissue measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in normal subjects strongly correlated with fat-free mass measured by total body potassium in normal subjects (male r = 0.91; female r = 0.89, both P < 0.0001). The correlation of protein estimated from the four-component model with fat-free mass measured by total body potassium was far weaker in male control subjects (r = 0.51, P < 0.05) and not significant in female control subjects (r = 0.38, P not significant). In the normal subjects protein estimated from the four-component model showed a much greater variation from protein estimated by total body potassium than did protein estimated simply as 27% of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry fat-free mass minus total body mineral. 6. Hydration in patients with chronic renal failure in whom fluid balance is believed to be normal on clinical criteria does not differ from that in normal subjects. The combined model of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and total body water is not a useful method for the measurement of body protein."

CD009647,0,10956241,0,Influence of hormone replacement therapy and aspirin on temperature regulation in postmenopausal women.,"Postmenopausal women receiving estrogen-replacement therapy (ERT) regulate body temperature (T(b)) at a lower level than women not receiving hormone replacement therapy (untreated) and women using estrogen plus progesterone therapy (E + P), but it is not clear if reproductive hormones alter T(b) by directly acting on central thermoregulatory centers or indirectly via a secondary mediator(s). The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the possible involvement of pyrogenic cytokines and cyclooxygenase (COX) products (e.g., prostaglandins) in the regulation of T(b) in three groups of postmenopausal women (8 ERT, 7 E + P, and 8 untreated). We measured ex vivo secretion of cytokine agonists [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta and -6] and modifiers (IL-2 soluble receptor, IL-1 receptor antagonist, soluble TNF receptor type I, soluble TNF receptor type II, soluble IL-6 receptor, and soluble glycoprotein 130) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and thermoregulatory responses at rest and during 1 h of passive whole body heating in the postmenopausal women before and after 3 days of placebo or aspirin (50 mg. day(-1). kg(-1)). With and without aspirin, the ERT group had a lower baseline rectal temperature (T(re); 0.44 degrees C, P < 0.004) and a reduced T(b) threshold for cutaneous vasodilation (0.29 degrees C and 0.38 degrees C, P < 0.01) compared with the untreated and E + P groups, respectively. In the placebo condition, waking morning oral temperature (T(or)) correlated with ex vivo secretion of the proteins associated with IL-6 bioactivity. Aspirin caused significant reductions in waking T(or) in the E + P group and in baseline T(re) in the untreated group. However, the difference in thermoregulation brought about by steroid hormone treatment could not be explained by these relatively modest apparent influences by cytokines and COX products. Therefore, the altered thermoregulation induced by reproductive steroid therapy appears to occur via a mechanism distinct from a classic infection-induced fever."

Because volume expansion does not always improve hemodynamic status, predictive parameters of fluid responsiveness are needed. Passive leg raising is a reversible maneuver that mimics rapid volume expansion. Passive leg raising-induced changes in stroke volume and its surrogates are reliable predictive indices of volume expansion responsiveness for mechanically ventilated patients. We hypothesized that the hemodynamic response to passive leg raising indicates fluid responsiveness in nonintubated patients without mechanical ventilation."

The correlation of the Strip Index with Gingival Index was highly significant (P is less than 0.001) and with Gingival Bleeding Index significant (P is less than 0.01). When determined both from the left side of the upper jaw and from the Ramfjord teeth, the correlation between these two areas was highly significant (P is less than 0.001) in the case of Strip Index but only slightly significant (P is less than 0.05) with Gingival Index.

CD009647,0,9934822,0,Bioelectrical characteristics of type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects with reference to body water compartments.,"Since bioelectrical characteristics correspond well to body water compartments, this study investigated bioelectrical differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects that could reflect differences in body water compartments. We investigated cross-sectionally 612 adult subjects, classified into 10 groups according to sex and disease (control, obese normal glucose tolerant, non-obese type 2 diabetes, obese type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes). Resistance (R), reactance (Xc) and phase angle (PA) were measured (800 microA - 50 kHz alternating current). The bioelectrical vector was obtained by plotting R and Xc normalized for height (ht), it is easily identified on the basis of the length (inversely related to the total body water, likewise R) and direction, given by the PA (inversely related to the extra-/intra-cellular water - ECW/ICW -). Results show that disease and sex had a significant (ANOVA: P<0.0001 for both F disease and F sex) and independent effect on both R/ht and Xc/ht; no difference was found between type 2 and type 1 diabetic groups. A bioelectrical vector with a lower PA characterized both type 2 and type 1 diabetic groups. An independent positive correlation between fasting plasma glucose and R/ht and a negative correlation between fasting plasma glucose and PA were observed. These findings suggest a non-different body water content and distribution between type 2 and type 1 diabetic subjects; the bioelectrical vector indicates a higher ECW/ICW in type 2 and type 1 diabetic compared to nondiabetic subjects."
CD009647,0,21316715,0,[Accidental hypothermia].,"Accidental hypothermia is an infrequent and under-diagnosed pathology, which causes fatalities every year. Its management requires thermometers to measure core temperature. An esophageal probe may be used in a hospital situation, although in moderate hypothermia victims epitympanic measurement is sufficient. Initial management involves advance life support and body rewarming. Vigorous movements can trigger arrhythmia which does not use to respond to medication or defibrillation until the body reaches 30°C. External, passive rewarming is the method of choice for mild hypothermia and a supplementary method for moderate or severe hypothermia. Active external rewarming is indicated for moderate or severe hypothermia or mild hypothermia that has not responded to passive rewarming. Active internal rewarming is indicated for hemodynamically stable patients suffering moderate or severe hypothermia. Patients with severe hypothermia, cardiac arrest or with a potassium level below 12 mmol/l may require cardiopulmonary bypass treatment."

Rectal temperature on admission was 20-34.9 degrees C. Sopor was present in 2 and various grades of coma were present in 10 patients. Arterial hypotension was recorded in 5, and shock in 9 patients. Increased serum creatinine level was found in 8 patients. The mean rectal temperature in the whole group was 31.3 degrees C +/- 4.7, ranging from 20.0 to 34.9 degrees C, and the mean serum creatinine level was 172.2 +/- 93.5, in range of 66.0 to 360.0 mumol/L. Negative correlation between those two parameters was found: r = -0.572. In 2 of them parameters of renal failure were analyzed: urine sodium concentration, creatinine urine/plasma ratio, urine osmolality, urine/plasma osmolality ratio, renal failure index and fractional excretion of filtered sodium. In one of the patients all parameters were within the range of functional oliguria, in an other the urine sodium concentration serum showed acute renal failure, but all other findings showed borderline values between functional oliguria and acute renal failure.

CD009647,0,2510458,0,Factors associated with discontinuation of long-term lithium treatment.,"Sixty-four outpatients with major affective disorder according to DSM-III and on continuous lithium treatment for an average duration of 7.8 years were first investigated in 1980 and then followed for 7 years. The predictive value of patients' attitudes to their lithium, the prognostic influence of psychiatric status, side effects, and anamnestic and laboratory data including lithium parameters were studied. At the end of the 7-year follow-up, 61% of the patients were still on lithium maintenance treatment, 25% had discontinued lithium for clinical reasons, and 14% of the patients had died. Side effects of lithium were the major clinical reason for discontinuing treatment, while attitudes towards medication were of minor importance. Approximately one fourth of the patients who discontinued lithium were differentiated from those who continued treatment by showing a high frequency of the neurologic side effects incoordination, paresthesia, and disturbed sensibility in addition to having more severe tremor. In yet another fourth of those who discontinued for clinical reasons, lithium was stopped by the treating psychiatrist as maximal urine osmolality values were considered to be too low. These patients did not show any signs of clinically significant impairment of renal functions. Their psychiatric status was excellent in terms of extremely low CPRS scores. The patients who died during the follow-up period were differentiated from those who continued treatment by a much higher frequency of alcohol and drug abuse prior to the initiation of lithium therapy. The total number of side effects and the number of severe side effects were significantly larger than in continuers on lithium. The most common causes of death were cardiovascular disease and suicide. In no case was the cause of death attributed to lithium therapy."
CD009647,0,10171156,0,Vortex pumping for routine cardiac surgery: a comparative study.,"Vortex pumping has become popular for mechanical assist applications, but has only recently received serious consideration for use as the arterial pump of choice for routine open-heart surgery. We report on a prospective randomized study designed to evaluate this pump in routine use. Sixteen patients undergoing routine coronary artery surgery were randomized into two groups in which the only difference in equipment and technique was the use of a Stockert roller pump in group S and a Biomedicus vortex pump in group B. The groups were compared with respect to haematology, perioperative fluid balance, transfusion requirements, complement activation, haemolysis and microbubble transmission. The groups were reasonably well matched, with slightly longer mean bypass and ischaemic times in group S (94.8 vs 105.5 minutes and 75.7 and 83.8 minutes respectively). Group B patients showed significant improvements over group S patients with respect to preservation of platelet numbers, decreased complement activation and reduced microbubble transmission. The afterload sensitivity of the vortex pump did not present the perfusionist with any practical problems although a different technique is required for initiating and terminating bypass. We conclude that vortex pumping would seem to offer better blood handling for routine use. More extensive testing is required to establish whether or not this would be reflected in clinically measurable improved patient outcome."

A body mass index of > or =25 has been classified as overweight and of > or =30 as obesity. However, national and epidemiologic data on overweight and obesity are not based on actual measures of body fat because of the difficulty of collecting such data from large groups and especially from the obese. There are now numerous direct and indirect methods to assess body fat. Anthropometric techniques are the most common indirect methods used in epidemiologic and clinical assessments, but these are restricted in the obese to circumferences. The other methods of assessing body fat are bioelectrical impedance, body density, total body water, and dual X-ray absorptiometry, all of which have advantages and limitations when applied to the obese. All these methods make use of statistical models in calculating body composition. There are several sources of available reference data for anthropometric measures for the US population, but no direct measures of body fat are currently available. There is a clear need for the continued development and validation of new and existing techniques to determine levels of fat."

Mean fluid intake (3112 +/- 1146 vs. 3498 +/- 1111 mL/d), fluid balance (146 +/- 1581 vs. 708 +/- 1402 mL/d), and cumulative fluid balance (1358 vs. 6867 mL) were all significantly lower in the treatment group. Mean fluid output was similar between the two groups. Pharmacist interventions can significantly decrease intake and result in a better fluid balance in fluid-restricted ICU patients who require PN."
CD009647,0,9171309,0,Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis without involving inappropriate secretion of vasopressin in an elderly woman: effect of intravenous administration of the nonpeptide vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist OPC-31260.,"We describe a 78-year-old female patient with severe hyponatremia owing to inappropriate antidiuresis. Despite hyponatremia, the urinary sodium excretion persisted with urine osmolality exceeding plasma osmolality. Although a water load decreased plasma sodium concentration and osmolality, the patient excreted only 40% of the water load after 4 h without decreased urine sodium concentrations and osmolality. The plasma vasopressin levels relative to plasma osmolality were not inappropriately elevated. Intravenous administration of the selective nonpeptide vasopressin V2 antagonist OPC-31260 decreased sodium concentration and osmolality in urine to lower values than in plasma. Concomitantly, the urine volume excretion increased markedly. In addition, restriction of water or administration of demeclocycline improved plasma sodium and plasma vasopressin levels relative to plasma osmolality to be normal. The findings indicate that the inappropriate antidiuresis in this patient was related to hyperfunction of the arginine vasopressin V2 receptor in the kidney which is not due to inappropriately secreted vasopressin."

CD009647,0,9585679,0,Respiratory mechanics before and after hemodialysis in mechanically ventilated patients.,"Hemodialysis, which leads to negative fluid balance, is often required in mechanically ventilated patients with renal failure. We conducted a prospective study on the influence of hemodialysis on the respiratory mechanics in 14 mechanically ventilated patients (10 men, 4 women, mean age 70.1 +/- 8.1 yr) with various causes of renal failure requiring hemodialysis in an intensive care unit. Respiratory mechanics were measured before and after hemodialysis using the interrupter technique under constant flow and constant volume. The values of several parameters of respiratory mechanics were significantly lower after hemodialysis: peak airway pressure (26.97 +/- 4.62 vs 23.45 +/- 4.13 cmH2O), airway pressure at zero flow (23.81 +/- 4.18 vs 21.50 +/- 3.79 cmH2O), airway plateau pressure (18.56 +/- 3.70 vs 16.48 +/- 3.07 cmH2O), and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (4.03 +/- 2.90 vs 2.65 +/- 1.84 cmH2O). Minimal respiratory resistance and maximal respiratory resistance were significantly decreased after hemodialysis (4.38 +/- 1.26 vs 2.99 +/- 1.00 cmH2O/L/s and 9.93 +/- 2.50 vs 8.39 +/- 2.43 cmH2O/L/s, respectively), but effective additional respiratory resistance and static respiratory compliance were not. Significant correlations were found between body weight reduction by hemodialysis and changes in minimal respiratory resistance (r = 0.758, p < 0.01), maximal respiratory resistance (r = 0.544, p < 0.05), and static respiratory compliance (r = 0.703, p < 0.01). We conclude that hemodialysis significantly alters the respiratory mechanics in mechanically ventilated renal failure patients and that the alteration may be related to the negative fluid balance caused by hemodialysis."

On the remaining one-third of the subjects (n = 46) cross-validation of the developed equations was carried out. The multiple regression equation for impedance had higher R-square (R2 = 0.89) and lower residual error (SEE = 3.32 kg) than the multiple regression equations for skinfolds (R2 = 0.81, SEE = 3.91 kg) or body mass index (R2 = 0.85, SEE = 3.94 kg). The cross-validation study showed that all three simple methods give reliable average body fat estimates. The difference in estimates of body fat between the reference method and impedance, BMI and skinfolds was 0.76 kg, -0.64 kg and -0.21 kg respectively, none of these differences being different from zero. However, the variance of body fat estimated from BMI (4.84 kg) was higher than body fat estimated from impedance (4.36 kg) (P = 0.013). The multiple regression analysis further showed that measurements of skinfold do not seem to add significantly to the prediction of body fat if height and weight are included.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009647,0,22331648,0,AFM study for morphological characteristics and biomechanical properties of human cataract anterior lens capsules.,"The aim of this study was to quantitatively investigate the morphologies (surface roughness) and biomechanical properties (Young's modulus) of human anterior lens capsules (ALCs) for noncataract and cataract groups using atomic force microscopy. Eight human ALCs obtained during phacoemulsification from patients with senile cataracts (72 ± 13 years) were investigated in both the hydrated and dehydrated conditions. The cataract group showed clearly the proliferated lens epithelial cells (LECs) with a monomorphic cell structure, a diameter of 12.54 ± 4.31 μm, and a height of 0.23 ± 0.04 μm, whereas the control group showed no LECs. A substantial amount of false-positive calcification was observed caused by the deposition of remnants of dried salt solution. Cataract group showed significantly higher surface roughness (382.06 nm, p ≤ 0.001) than control group in the anterior side of ALCs, whereas cataract group showed significantly lower surface roughness (353.79 nm, p ≤ 0.001) than control group in their posterior side. Cataract group showed significantly higher Young's modulus (69.52 kPa, p ≤ 0.001) compared to the control group, regardless of the ALC side. Therefore, it is significant that this study provides a new method to examine the nanostructural characteristic and biomechanical property of human ALCs through a nanometer-scale resolution microscopy technique."

By performing simultaneous measurements of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) to check the water-barrier function of the stratum corneum and cutaneous conductance to the high-frequency electric current of 3.5 MHz, which is an indicator of skin-surface hydration state, in patients with psoriasis who had lesions of various grades of severity, we obtained data indicating that there is an inverse relationship between these functions of the stratum corneum. Furthermore, a time course study of TEWL and functional analysis of stratum corneum by an in vivo water sorption-desorption test performed on the experimentally induced scaly lesions after adhesive-tape stripping demonstrated that such pathologic stratum corneum is characterized by a water-holding defect that is associated with increased TEWL."

CD009647,0,8601041,0,The combination of mannitol and albumin in the priming solution reduces positive intraoperative fluid balance during cardiopulmonary bypass.,"During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) an adequate reservoir volume is maintained by the addition of crystalloid, colloid or packed cells to the reservoir. This volume contributes to the overall perioperative positive fluid balance. We studied the effect of the preoperative addition of either 75 g albumin, or 50 g mannitol followed by 50 g at commencement of rewarming or both of the above to a bypass circuit prime of lactated Ringer's solution (LR) on intraoperative fluid balance, postoperative indices of oxygenation and time to extubation. The study was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded controlled trial of 103 patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring CPB. There was a large and highly significant reduction in volume of fluid added to the reservoir during CPB (2137 +/- 1499 ml versus 144 +/- 230 ml), the fluid balance during bypass, including prime volume (3236 +/- 650 ml versus 5876 +/- 1465 ml), and perioperative fluid balance (4470 +/- 936 ml versus 7023 +/- 1760 ml) in the group receiving both mannitol and albumin in the pump prime compared with the group receiving only lactated Ringer's solution. There were no differences between the groups with respect to both measured indices of oxygenation measured on return to ICU (alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference (DA-aO2) or arterial oxygen tension to inspired oxygen fraction ratio (PaO2/FiO2), or time from ICU admission to extubation."

CD009647,0,22460467,0,Bioimpedance vector pattern in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Direct bioimpedance measures (resistance, reactance, phase angle (PA)) determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) detect changes in tissue electrical properties. The study was conducted to evaluate soft tissue hydration and mass through pattern analysis of vector plots as height, normalized resistance, and reactance measurements by bioelectric impedance vector analysis in patients with head and neck cancer. Whole-body measurements were made with ImpediMed bioimpedance analysis in 56 adult, white, male subjects 42 to 79 years old: 28 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (H&NC) and 28 healthy volunteers matched by sex, age and BMI as a control group. All patients were previously untreated and without active nutritional interventions. Mean vectors of H&NC group vs. the control group were characterized by an increased normalized resistance component with a reduced reactance component (separate 95% confidence limits, P<0.05), indicating a decreased ionic conduction (dehydration) with loss of dielectric mass (cell membranes and tissue interfaces) of soft tissue. Monitoring vector displacement trajectory toward the reference target vector position may represent useful feedback in support therapy planning of individual patients before surgery in patients with head and neck cancer in order to reduce post-operational complications."
CD009647,0,17323538,0,"Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: how to predict, prevent, diagnose and treat it.","(1) When people who are physically dependent on alcohol stop drinking, they experience an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms generally resolve spontaneously within a week, but more severe forms may be associated with generalised seizures, hallucinations and delirium tremens, which can be fatal. (2) We carried out a literature review in order to obtain answers to the following questions: how to predict or rapidly diagnose a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome; how to prevent and treat this syndrome; how to manage severe forms; and how to deal with the risk of vitamin B1 deficiency. (3) The main risk factors for severe withdrawal syndrome are: chronic heavy drinking; a history of generalised seizures; and a history of delirium tremens. (4) Anxiety, agitation, tremor, excessive sweating, altered consciousness and hallucinations are signs of a severe withdrawal syndrome. (5) Individual support and effective communication seem to reduce the risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. (6) Oral benzodiazepines are the best-assessed drugs for preventing a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly the risk of seizures. When given for a maximum of 7 days, the adverse effects are usually mild. (7) Clinical trials of other antiepileptics suggest they are less effective than benzodiazepines, and their addition to benzodiazepine therapy offers no tangible advantage. (8) Betablockers increase the risk of hallucinations, and clonidine increases the risk of nightmares, and the efficacy of these two drugs is not well documented. Neuroleptics increase the risk of seizures. There are no convincing data to support the use of magnesium sulphate or meprobamate (the latter carries a risk of serious adverse effects). Acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are not beneficial in alcohol withdrawal. (9) Gradual withdrawal, i.e. ingestion of decreasing amounts of alcohol, has not been compared with other methods but is generally not recommended. (10) There are no specific recommendations on hydration. Note that excessive water-sodium intake carries a risk of pulmonary oedema in patients with heart disease. (11) As vitamin B1 deficiency is frequent and can lead to serious complications in alcohol-dependent patients, oral vitamin B1 supplementation is widely recommended, despite the absence of comparative trials. High doses must be used to compensate for poor absorption. Intravenous administration is best if patients have very poor nutritional status or severe complications such as Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy (a medical emergency), even though rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported after vitamin B1 injection. (12) Planned alcohol withdrawal in specialised hospital units has been extensively studied. Outpatient withdrawal may be more appropriate for patients who are at low risk of developing severe withdrawal syndrome. (13) A large proportion of alcohol-dependent patients were excluded from trials of withdrawal strategies. These include elderly patients, patients with serious psychiatric or somatic disorders, and patients who are also dependent on other substances. (14) An oral benzodiazepine is the best-assessed treatment for a single episode of generalised seizures or hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal. (15) In randomised comparative trials benzodiazepines were more effective than neuroleptics in preventing delirium-related mortality. Currently, with appropriate fluid-electrolyte support, continuous monitoring of vital signs, and respiratory support if necessary, the mortality rate for delirium tremens is under 3%. (16) In practice, patients who are attempting to stop drinking alcohol need close personal support and communication, and a reassuring environment, as well as regular monitoring for early signs of a withdrawal syndrome; the latter may require benzodiazepine therapy."

CD009647,0,1915206,0,Body impedance measurements during dialysis.,"Changes in body weight in relation to changes in body impedance were studied in six male and four female patients before and during dialysis. Before dialysis, fat-free mass from skinfolds was 46.5 +/- 6.8 kg, and total body water calculated from bio-electrical impedance was 36.9 +/- 5.2 kg. Body water expressed as a percentage of fat-free mass was calculated to be 80 +/- 4%. Mean weight loss, which was assumed to be only loss of water, was 2.7 +/- 0.7 kg. Total body impedance increased by 80 +/- 16 omega from 495 +/- 39 omega to 575 +/- 47 omega. Weight loss and increase in body impedance were highly correlated (r = -0.91, P less than 0.001). However, based on prediction formulas for total body water from bio-electrical impedance, the observed weight (water) loss should be associated with an increase in impedance of only 39 +/- 11 omega. It is concluded that the impedance value before dialysis is a relatively low value, due to the low specific resistivity of the excess of extra-cellular water in the body before dialysis. As a consequence, prediction formulas for body composition from bio-electrical impedance, developed in normal hydrated subjects, overestimate body composition (total body water, fat-free mass) in subjects with oedema."
CD009647,0,2111870,0,Mannitol-induced acute renal failure.,"Mannitol is widely used to reduce intracranial pressure and is protective against ischemic and nephrotoxic acute renal failure. However, the capacity of this seemingly innocuous agent to produce acute renal failure is not well recognized. We report herein the clinical course of 8 cases of mannitol-induced acute renal failure. In addition, we reviewed all previously reported cases of mannitol-induced renal failure. In the present series, acute oliguric renal failure developed within 3.5 +/- 1.1 (mean +/- SD) days after receiving daily and total mannitol doses of 189 +/- 64 g and 626 +/- 270 g, respectively, over 3.5 +/- 1.5 days. The peak serum creatinine was 5.7 +/- 2.7 mg/dl and peak osmolal gap was 74 +/- 39 mOsm/kg water. Renal tubular epithelial cells containing vacuoles were seen in the urinary sediments of 6 patients. Renal function improved rapidly upon discontinuation of mannitol and/or removal of mannitol by hemodialysis. In those previously reported cases in which the baseline renal function was normal, acute renal failure developed after receiving total mannitol doses of 1171 +/- 376 g. The peak osmolal gap was 107 +/- 17. In contrast, in those with underlying renal compromise, renal function worsened after a total mannitol dose of 295 +/- 143 g. The pathogenesis of mannitol-induced renal failure is not yet established but may be associated with renal vasoconstriction produced by high concentrations of mannitol. This may be averted in clinical practice by monitoring the osmolal gap, rather than serum osmolality alone, when using mannitol infusions for the treatment of intracranial hypertension."

CD009647,0,16861432,0,Prolonged international normalized ratio correlates with a large intravascular fluid balance after major abdominal surgery.,"We performed a prospective randomized study of 32 patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy and did not receive blood during and after surgery. The patients were prospectively assigned to two groups related to fluid balance in the immediate postoperative period. Group 1 (14 patients) were maintained at a positive intravascular fluid balance of 0-1000 mL; Group 2 (18 patients) were maintained at a positive balance of 1000-2000 mL. Complete blood counts and coagulation tests (International Normalized Ratio) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were performed at three time points: the day before surgery, on arrival at the postanesthesia care unit, and on leaving the postanesthesia care unit (16 h later). There were significant differences in International Normalized Ratio values between the groups with deterioration during the time they were in the postanesthesia care unit but not in aPTT values. Positive correlation was found between the amount of positive fluid balance and International Normalized Ratio prolongation, but not with aPTT, suggesting that restricted intravascular fluid balance is beneficial for preservation of coagulation after major abdominal surgery."
CD009647,0,8780363,0,Applications of bioelectrical impedance analysis for body composition to epidemiologic studies.,"Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a promising tool in the evaluation of body composition in large population studies because it is fast, is inexpensive, and does not require extensive operator training or cross-validation. The empiric nature of the relation between resistance and reactance measured by BIA and body composition has led to the development of equations that translate the raw data into liters of body water or kilograms of fat-free mass (FFM) or fat mass. These equations may not be easily transferred from one population to another if the populations differ significantly in important determinants of body composition such as age, obesity, and illness. I review two recent studies from the Framingham Heart Study in which BIA was first compared with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a validation technique, and then compared with the body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) as an alternative estimate of body fat. BIA was a good predictor of DXA-derived FFM (r = 0.85-0.88, P < 0.001) and was superior to BMI as an estimator of body fat."
CD009647,0,14971708,0,[Diagnosis and therapy of hyponatremia].,"Hyponatremia is associated with important morbidity, that includes the often fatal central pontine myelinolysis. It occurs more frequently in patients treated with diuretics, in liver cirrhosis, congestive heart failure and in the elderly. A sodium (Na) imbalance should be considered as highly probable in the presence of delirium, confusion, inappropriate behavior and coma. In the majority of cases hyponatremia is caused by Na depletion. This is associated with volume depletion, which, in turn, triggers thirst. The consequent reintroduction of solvent without solutes reconstitutes the volume lost, whilst further diluting Na. Less frequently an excess of solute-free water introduced orally or infused intravenously is retained in the presence of a reduced renal diluting capacity. Hyponatremia due to water excess may be distinguished from that caused by solute depletion by careful history taking, physical examination and by measurements of the body weight. Simple formulas, easily applicable to the bedside allow an accurate estimate of the water excess or solute deficit, and hence an accurate and effective quantitative correction of the alteration."

The pharmacokinetics of metronidazole was, therefore, evaluated in nine hospitalized patients who have no evidence of liver or kidney failure. The patients received the drug for prophylaxis or treatment of infectious conditions. Serial blood samples were obtained from the patients and serum metronidazole concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The following pharmacokinetic parameters (mean +/- standard deviation) were obtained: half-life = 10.2 +/- 3.1 hours, elimination rate constant = 0.075 +/- 0.026 hour-1, volume of distribution = 0.65 +/- 0.25 l kg-1, and total body clearance = 0.048 +/- 0.024 l h-1 kg-1. The mean value of these parameters are not substantially different from those obtained in the normal subjects. However, a higher interpatient variation was found in the hospitalized patients. The heterogeneity of health condition, body composition, fluid balance, hemodynamics and nutritional status may all contribute to the variability in pharmacokinetic characteristics."

We have previously described a method that permits percutaneous replacement of surgically placed jejunostomy feeding tubes, and now present our results with the use of this technique in 350 consecutive esophagogastrectomy patients. Replacement jejunostomy as required in 17 patients (4.9%). All patients had successful percutaneous jejunostomy replacement. There were no procedural complications or deaths. The timing of feeding tube replacement following esophagogastrectomy was predictive of the indication. Before 16 weeks, the indication for feeding tube replacement was intubation and inability to eat (1 patient) or anorexia with weight loss and dehydration (7 patients). At or after 16 weeks, the indications for feeding tube replacement were all related to symptoms resulting from recurrent carcinoma.

This study examines the use of Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (a nonalkaline nonirritating cleanser) in patients with rosacea. To eliminate the confounding effects of various treatments, the cleanser was studied for a 2-week period in the absence of rosacea therapy following a 2-week washout period in patients with mild to moderate rosacea. During the washout period, patients were asked to cleanse twice daily with Dove Sensitive Skin Bar. During the 2-week study period, patients were monitored for skin barrier function through transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and corneometry; patients also were monitored for rosacea severity. Thirty patients were enrolled. No significant increase in TEWL was demonstrated at any point during the study, indicating that the gentle skin cleanser did not damage the skin barrier. Additionally, the cleanser was shown to maintain skin hydration. Furthermore, a post hoc statistical analysis suggests there was a significant reduction (P<.05) in investigator-assessed rosacea severity on the cheeks, forehead, and nose at the end of week 1 and on the cheeks, forehead, and chin at the end of week 2 compared with the end of the washout period (after 2 weeks of cleansing with Dove Sensitive Skin Bar). The mild nonirritating action of the gentle skin cleanser was supported by the lack of adverse events and the tolerability shown in the study. There were no increases in erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging, burning, or lack of smoothness in the skin during the 2-week study period, despite the fact that patients were not being treated for their rosacea during the study. These results indicate that Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser may be a good choice for the cleansing part of a total rosacea skin care regimen."

CD009647,0,2469901,0,Clinical care of the aging hypertensive patient.,"That elderly hypertensive patients need to be treated is now well established, as major clinical trials have confirmed the reduction in serious complications and organ damage in the treated patient. However, the concomitant findings on the high rates of adverse side effects of drug therapies to lower blood pressure are of concern. The physiologic and disease changes that occur with aging may explain some of the adverse drug responses encountered in this population. Nondrug treatment of hypertension, including sodium restriction and weight reduction, would be desirable in the elderly, but there are no trials of the efficacy and safety of these methods in this population. Homeostatic fragility in the elderly is the loss of the ability to regulate cardiovascular and respiratory function, and fluid and electrolyte balance under conditions of stress. Introduction of antihypertensive agents with their global effects on these homeostatic processes leads to frequent complications such as orthostatic hypotension, cardiac depression, reduced cerebral blood flow, and abnormalities in metabolic, volume, and electrolyte control. Although these adverse reactions explain some of the compliance problems in the elderly, several psychosocial factors also hinder the ability of older patients to follow therapeutic protocols. The need for alternative and more appropriate therapies tailored to fit these problems associated with aging is the desired goal of future blood pressure intervention policies."

Extracellular water (ECW) decreased in the six times per week compared with the three per week hemodialysis group. There were no significant between-group differences in phase angle, intracellular water, or body cell mass (BCM). In the Nocturnal Trial, there were no significant between-group differences in any study parameter. Any gain in 'dry' body weight corresponded to increased adiposity rather than muscle mass but was not statistically significant. Thus, frequent in-center hemodialysis reduced ECW but did not increase serum albumin or BCM while frequent nocturnal hemodialysis yielded no net effect on parameters of nutritional status or body composition."

Energy expenditure was predicted from heart rate monitoring, and energy intake was assessed with a 4-day dietary record. Lean body mass (LBM), body fat (BF), and total body water (TBW) were estimated with a bioelectrical impedance method. The mean energy expenditure and energy intake were 1845 kcal/d (7719 kJ/d) and 1746 kcal/d (7305 kJ/d) in male, and 1550 kcal/d (6485 kJ/d) and 1489 kcal/d (6230 kJ/d) in female subjects. Thirty per cent of the patients were in a negative energy balance. Mean values (+/- SD) of LBM were 50.2 +/- 7.81 kg and 39.6 +/- 6.78 kg, of BF 14.4 +/- 4.98 kg and 19.6 +/- 6.26 kg, of TBW 38.2 +/- 4.67 kg and 29.2 +/- 4.16 kg, and of basal metabolic rate expressed per unit LBM 24 +/- 2.6 kcal/kg LBM and 27 +/- 4.5 kcal/kg LBM in male and female subjects, respectively. The males had a lower per cent body fat expressed per kg body weight, also supported by low triceps skinfold values. Twenty per cent of the patients had triceps skinfold values indicating severe malnutrition according to definitions in the literature.

Improvement of the neurological signs and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure was recognized by responsible physicians in close association with the administration of Glyceol (75.1%). The intracranial pressure measured directly also decreased in most cases following the administration of Glyceol (81.2%). No significant changes were observed in serum electrolytes and osmolarity at the end of the long-term administration. Unfavourable changes in clinical conditions which were considered very likely or suspected to be due to the long-term administration of Glyceol were recorded in 2 cases (0.1%) or 13 cases (1.0%), respectively. Most of these changes were abnormalities of serum electrolytes. It appeared, however, that the abnormalities of serum electrolytes may be readily correctable, and rarely induced if standard care of the serum water-electrolyte balance is carried out and unless too large doses are employed. Other changes appeared to be related more to preexistent complications and/or the administration of other drugs, rather than to the administration of Glyceol alone. Thus, administration of Glyceol appeared feasible for the therapy of elevated intracranial pressure over the long term."

CD009647,0,10875060,0,[Causes and consequences of elderly's agitated and aggressive behavior].,"Agitation and aggressiveness are frequent in the elderly and often related to dementia. As a result of the ageing of the general population this is becoming a major public health concern. No or little epidemiological data, during primary health care, about symptoms, co-morbidity, nor medical and social consequences of elderlys' disruptive behavior have been gathered or published in the French literature. Thus, in order to describe these disorders, a survey in cooperation with general practitioners (GP) was conducted. A representative sample of 212 French GP's, all with preferential geriatric activity were asked to conduct a study by including retrospectively their two most recent patients older than 65, who had exhibited agitation and/or aggressiveness. From this cross sectional study, 410 patients (female: 61%, male: 39%) were included. The mean age was 81 years (sd: 7.65). The patients suffered from change in verbal behavior (80%), verbal aggressiveness (71%), physical agitation (60%), wandering (48%), and/or physical aggressiveness (31%). The average of disruptive behavior symptoms per patient was 2.9. The symptoms appeared progressively in 81% of patients, the mean duration was two years and it was the first episode in 40% of patients. Disruptive behaviors may be explained in view of organic illness in 62% of patients (cardiovascular disease: 37%, neurologic: 12%, diabetes: 7%, dehydratation: 5%), dementia (Alzheimer disease: 20%, vascular dementia: 18%, mixed dementia: 14%). In 54% of patients disruptive behavior may be explained in view of depression: 34%, and anxiety disorder: 31%. A triggering factor was observed in 57% of cases (psychosocial stress: 39%). Somatic consequences of the symptoms were frequently identified: decrease of alimentary intake: 39%, weight loss: 27%, dehydratation: 11%, falls: 32%, and irregular medication intake: 31%. Limitation of daily life activities: 85%, and family life: 97% were also noted. Acceptability of patient's symptoms by the family was good (no discomfort or transitory and mild irritability) in 61% of cases, and very bad (reactions of exhaustion, hospitalization requirement) in 13%. This study carried out during primary care, showed that the elderly's disruptive behaviors cause severe medical consequences and familial and social distress."
CD009647,0,7919137,0,Effect of erythrocyte mass on arterial blood pressure in dialysis patients receiving maintenance erythropoietin therapy.,"Treatment of renal anemia with recombinant human erythropoietin (rEPO) frequently raises arterial blood pressure. The objective of this study was to determine whether this is a direct effect of rEPO or a consequence of the expansion of erythrocyte mass. Twenty-three chronic hemodialysis patients receiving maintenance rEPO therapy who had uncontrolled anemia due to iron deficiency were studied. It was anticipated that repletion of iron stores with iv iron dextran would restore rEPO responsiveness, leading to a gradual rise in hematocrit to the target values (0.30 to 0.33). The effect of the increase in hematocrit on arterial blood pressure could then be dissected from the direct effect of rEPO in patients receiving constant doses of rEPO throughout the study period. To this end, arterial blood pressure, iron indices, hematocrit, and measures of fluid balance were monitored at baseline and for a 10-wk period after iron repletion. In eight patients, the hematocrit transiently rose above 0.33, triggering a reduction in rEPO dosage. In the remaining 15 patients, rEPO dosage was held constant during the study period. In this subgroup, repletion of iron stores led to a rise in hematocrit from 0.25 +/- 0.04 to 0.32 +/- 0.04 (P < 0.001) within 4 wk. Despite the significant rise in hematocrit, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure values remained virtually unchanged. Likewise, body weight and interdialytic fluid gain were unaltered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,14752239,0,Low sodium excretion in SIADH patients with low diuresis.,"It is well known that during low diuresis or low effective circulating volume, salt excretion is low. The aim of this study was to find out whether salt excretion, expressed as either urinary sodium concentration (UNa) or fractional sodium excretion (FENa), and the combined use of FENa and fractional urea excretion (FEurea) still differentiate between hyponatremic SIADH and hyponatremic salt depletion (SD) patients when diuresis is low. The relationships between UNa, FENa and diuresis, indirectly estimated by the urinary to plasma creatinine ratio (U/P creat), were studied in 42 hyponatremic SIADH patients, 21 hyponatremic SD patients and 66 normonatremic controls (CO) of similar age and sex ratio. There was no significant relationship between UNa and U/P creat either in SIADH or in SD or CO patients. FENa and U/P creat were inversely correlated, both in CO (r = -0.72; p < 0.001) and in SIADH (r = -0.68; p < 0.001). SIADH and SD patients can be fairly well differentiated from one another using FENa and U/P creat. Even with high U/P creat values, SIADH patients, despite a sharp decrease in their FENa values, presented still higher FENa values than SD patients did (mean FENa = 0.3 +/- 0.2% in SIADH and 0.1 +/- 0.04% in SD; p < 0.05). However, FENa values of SIADH patients with low diuresis (mean FENa = 0.3 +/- 0.2% for a mean U/P creat = 191 +/- 40) are indistinguishable from those of SD patients with normal urine volumes (mean FENa = 0.2 +/- 0.2% for a mean U/P creat = 92 +/- 30). The combined use of FENa and FEurea remains a reliable way to discriminate SD patients and SIADH patients, as far as the differential limit value for FENa is narrowed to a value of 0.15%, for hyponatremic patients with U/P creat >140."

The effects of passive leg raising (PLR) and standing on Qtbi were measured before and after blood withdrawal. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), transcutaneous oxygen tension (PtcO2), mean arterial BP (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were also measured before and after blood withdrawal. Thoracic bioimpedance cardiac index (CI) decreased 18% (0.8 +/- 0.1 L/min.m2, p less than .0001) and stroke volume index (SI) decreased 22% (14.8 +/- 2.7 ml/beat.m2, p less than .0001) after blood withdrawal. HR, MAP, SaO2, and PtcO2 were not significantly different after blood withdrawal. Before blood withdrawal PLR increased CI 6.8% (0.3 +/- 0.1 L/min.m2, p less than .0001); after blood withdrawal PLR increased CI 11.1% (0.4 +/- 0.1 L/min.m2, p less than .0001).

CD009647,0,2257702,0,Incidence and etiology of hyponatremia in an intensive care unit.,"To evaluate the incidence and causes of hyponatremia in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, retrospective and prospective studies were done. Hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium concentration equal to or less than 134 mmol/l (134 mEq/l). Prospectively, 29.6% of patients displayed hyponatremia. Relevant data were obtained in twelve patients. Two patients did not have serum hypoosmolality. In the ten patients with serum hypoosmolality, urine osmolality was not maximally dilute and urine sodium concentration was greater than 30 mmol/l (30 mEq/l) suggesting inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). However, three patients exhibited suppressed ADH levels despite absence of maximal urinary dilution. The data suggest that hyponatremia is common in ICU patients and that renal diluting defects are frequent. Therefore, hypotonic fluid should be administered cautiously."
CD009647,0,11347985,0,Bioelectric impedance analysis of acute body water changes in congestive heart failure.,"The body water changes indicated by bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) and body weight were studied in 12 patients admitted to hospital for acute treatment of congestive heart failure (NYHA-class II-III). BIA was performed at the time of admittance and on the third day by using a multifrequency technique, which allows simultaneous estimation of the total body water (TBW) and the extracellular fluid (ECF) and intracellular fluid (ICF) volumes. The body weight at admittance was 85+/-20 kg. Body weight correlated with the body water compartments (r - 0.9, p<0.001). From day 1 to day 3, the body weight decreased by 2.9+/-1.7 kg. BIA estimated the corresponding reductions of the physiological body fluid spaces to 3.2+/-2.4 L (TBW), 2.7+/-1.6 L (ECF) and 0.5+/-3.2 L (ICF). These results indicate that diuretic treatment for acute congestive heart failure mainly lowers the ECF volume. However, changes in body weight correlated poorly with changes in TBW, r=-0.11. We conclude that, although BIA corresponded well to the weight changes at the group level, a poor correlation in individual patients suggests that BIA is not a suitable tool to monitor the fluid balance in patients with acute congestive heart failure undergoing diuretic treatment."
CD009647,0,19368300,0,[Use of bioelectrical impedance for the estimation of skeletal muscle mass in elderly men].,"The aim of the present study was twofold: a) to determine the agreement between bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for the estimation of skeletal muscle mass (SMM), and b) to analyze the predictive power of anthropometric variables and BIA for the prediction of SMM in the elderly. Sixty elderly men (61 to 80 years) from the southern region of Brazil were studied. Anthropometric variables (body weight and height) were measured, the resistance and hydration of fat-free tissues variables were determined by tetrapolar BIA (BF-310, Biodynamics). A whole body DEXA scan was also performed (Lunar Prodigy DF + 14319 Radiation and 7.52.002 DPX-L software). Differences between methods were analyzed using the t-test, analysis of residues and correlation coefficient. The predictive value of the anthropometric variables and BIA was evaluated by multiple linear regression. BIA overestimated SMM on average by 0.60 kg (sd = 1.59) when compared to DEXA, however, no statistical difference was observed (p > 0.05). There was a strong correlation between methods (r = 0.90; p < 0.01). Regression analysis demonstrated that the Ht2/ R variable explained 86% of the variation in SMM when adjusted for body weight and age, and this relationship did not depend on body fat, hydration of fat-free tissues or BMI. Thus, BIA as tested here is a valid method for the estimation of SMM in elderly men and its values can be best predicted using the regression model proposed, which included Ht2/R adjusted for body weight and age."
CD009647,0,3324259,0,"Heat tolerance, thermoregulation and ageing.","Older individuals, regardless of how one classifies 'old', are the most rapidly growing portion of the population. Statistics from heat waves and other morbidity-mortality data strongly suggest that older persons are at greater risk of developing life-threatening manifestations of heat stress such as heat stroke. Most laboratory studies have found that ageing is associated with decreased heat tolerance and alterations in thermoregulatory effector responses. What is not so clear is the role of ageing per se in this decreased heat tolerance (as opposed to some concomitant functional decline, e.g. decreasing VO2max, which accompanies ageing across a population). Studies have shown decrements in resting heat tolerance and responses to thermal transients in older adults. With exercise in warm environments, most research has focused on the sweating response and it appears that whether or not sweating rate declines in the elderly is dependent upon the environment studied. In hot dry environments, older persons (of both sexes) consistently secrete sweat at a lower rate than their younger counterparts. However, as humidity of the environment increases, this difference tends to disappear. A key issue which deserves further attention is that of hydration in the elderly, both in terms of body water content and compartmentalisation, and of skin water content. Finally, ageing is often accompanied by other conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular insufficiencies, long term therapeutic drug modalities) which further affect heat tolerance and thermoregulation."

CD009647,0,20398123,0,Comfort feeding only: a proposal to bring clarity to decision-making regarding difficulty with eating for persons with advanced dementia.,"Feeding and eating difficulties leading to weight loss are common in the advanced stages of dementia. When such problems arise, family members are often faced with making a decision regarding the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. The existing evidence based on observational studies suggests that feeding tubes do not improve survival or reduce the risk of aspiration, yet the use of feeding tubes is prevalent in patients with dementia, and the majority of nursing home residents do not have orders documenting their wishes about the use of artificial hydration and nutrition. One reason is that orders to forgo artificial hydration and nutrition get wrongly interpreted as ""do not feed,"" resulting in a reluctance of families to agree to them. Furthermore, nursing homes fear regulatory scrutiny of weight loss and wrongly believe that the use of feeding tubes signifies that everything possible is being done. These challenges might be overcome with the creation of clear language that stresses the patient's goals of care. A new order, ""comfort feeding only,"" that states what steps are to be taken to ensure the patient's comfort through an individualized feeding care plan, is proposed. Comfort feeding only through careful hand feeding, if possible, offers a clear goal-oriented alternative to tube feeding and eliminates the apparent care-no care dichotomy imposed by current orders to forgo artificial hydration and nutrition."

Hunter Hypertension Research Group.,"Doxazosin, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist with potentially favourable effects on lipid status was evaluated in 25 otherwise healthy general practice patients with mild to moderate hypertension. A mean dose of 5.7 mg produced a significant fall in lying and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure over an 11 week period as well as an 8% increase in HDL cholesterol and a 7.5% decrease in the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio. Following this, the doxazosin dose was halved and pindolol, a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was added (mean dose 7.8 mg) to maintain blood pressure control. At the completion of 11 weeks of combined alpha- and beta-blockade, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were found to be unaltered when compared to pretreatment; however there was a small but significant fall in total cholesterol. This study demonstrates that this combination of alpha- and beta-blocking antihypertensive therapy can produce potentially favourable blood lipid changes."

CD009647,0,1982845,0,Feasibility of in-center staff-assisted cycler dialysis.,"Many debilitated elderly patients are not currently considered for peritoneal dialysis because they cannot perform the procedure themselves and they lack adequate back-up support in the family or extended care facility. They often tolerate hemodialysis poorly, and may exhaust their vascular access sites. We have provided intermittent in-center staff-assisted cycler dialysis to two debilitated elderly patients for a total of 12 patient months. Initial peritoneal equilibration tests indicated high solute transport rates in both patients, and led us to evolve a regimen based on frequent cycles. We use a 4 days a week regimen, cycling 12-14 liters during a 7.5 hour period each day. The patients tolerated the treatment well, with improved control of fluid balance and maintenance or improvement in appetite compared to baseline periods of CAPD. Mean pre-treatment BUN is 87 mg/dl. This is 29% higher than during CAPD, and has been stable. The requirement for additional nursing care has been variable but not disruptive of other activities once we established a dedicated space and routine. Current cycler technology permits consideration of in-center cycling as a practical alternative for many patients previously excluded from peritoneal dialysis."

Although these syndromes are thought to be immunologically mediated treatment with steroids, immunoglobulin and plasmapharesis has been disappointing. Based on our preliminary experience with the treatment of 6 cases of paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes with protein A immunoadsorption, an institutional, open-arm treatment protocol was established. Since our original report we have treated an additional 7 patients with this method. The 13 cases were accrued over a 2 year period and included 10 women and 3 men with an average age of 63. The paraneoplastic syndromes included 6 cases of cerebellar degeneration, 3 cases of opsoclonus/myoclonus, 3 cases of encephalomyelitis and 1 case of Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Primary cancers included 4 cases of small cell lung cancer, 2 cases of breast cancer, 2 cases of lymphoma and 1 each of acinic cell cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, Merkel cell cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and rectal cancer. Anti-neuronal antibody status, cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging studies as well as cancer staging and treatment protocols were reviewed. Neurologic syndromes were clinically separated into component symptoms and signs for assessment of treatment effect. The treatment goal was a total of 6 sessions of protein A immunoadsorption given twice weekly. Twelve of 13 patients completed therapy and one patient developed cutaneous vasculitis during the second session with termination of treatment. Of the remaining patients 3/12 had a complete response of the primary clinical symptom/sign while 6/12 had a partial response for a total response rate of 9/12 (75%). Toxicity was limited to cutaneous vasculitis in 1 patient and an episode of hemisensory changes in another patient. Current treatment of paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes remains unsatisfactory. Despite the small number of patients in this report, protein A immunoadsorption is a promising therapy which deserves further study in a larger population of patients with paraneoplastic syndromes."

CD009647,0,3913501,0,Age and the endocrine system.,"The pattern of age-induced changes in each endocrine system is unique. Both hormone levels and target organ responsivity are altered in the aging endocrine-cardiovascular system. Serum levels of vasopressor hormones both increase (norepinephrine) and decrease (renin, aldosterone). Target organ responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation in the heart and probably also in vascular smooth muscle decrease due to postreceptor changes. These effects contribute to the clinical problems of hypertension and orthostatic hypotension which characterize the elderly. Aging produces mild carbohydrate intolerance and a minimal increase in fasting serum glucose in healthy, nonobese individuals, primarily due to decreasing postreceptor responsiveness to insulin. Aging decreases the metabolism of thyroxine, including its conversion to triiodothyronine, but clinically significant alterations of thyroid hormone levels do not occur. Changes in the end-organ response to thyroid hormones, however, significantly alter the clinical presentation of thyroid diseases. Aging shifts the serum vasopressin-serum osmolality relationship toward higher serum vasopressin levels probably due to altered baroreceptor input, probably contributing to the tendency toward hyponatremia in the elderly. Aging slows the metabolism of cortisol, but glucocorticoid levels in the human are essentially unaltered by age. However, recent data indicate that delta-5 adrenal steroids decrease markedly in both men and women. Nodules in the anterior pituitary, the thyroid, and the adrenal increase in frequency with aging. Finally, the reproductive system is primarily altered by endocrine cell death, by unknown mechanisms, resulting in decreased estrogen and testosterone levels in women and men. This most obvious age-related endocrine change turns out to be incompletely understood and is not representative of most age-related endocrine changes. Despite characterization of these many age-related alterations in endocrine systems, therapeutic issues often remain unexplored, and more data are needed in many areas."

CD009647,0,2123281,0,Nutritional and metabolic effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment for prostate cancer.,"Cancer commonly leads to weight loss associated with increased glucose production and protein breakdown. Medical or surgical castration results in decreased muscle mass, increased fat mass, and weight gain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in body composition, protein metabolism, hepatic glucose production, (HGP), and basal energy expenditure in 10 men with advanced stage C and D prostate cancer receiving a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (Buserelin). Metabolic parameters and nutritional status were determined at 0, 2, 6, and 12 months of therapy. Baseline measurements of plasma leucine appearance (76.2 +/- 5.4 microM/kg/h) and HGP rates (80.1 +/- 2.9 mg/m2/min) were greater than previously reported for normal volunteers. GnRH agonist therapy in prostate cancer patients was associated with a significant reduction in serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), luteinizing hormone (LH), and cortisol, and significant increases in triiodothyronine (T3) and free triiodothyronine (free T3). Neither basal energy expenditure nor plasma leucine appearance rates were changed over time, but there were significant linear reductions in HGP rates (80.1 +/- 2.9 mg/m2/min, mean +/- SEM; 79.9 +/- 2.3, 73.7 +/- 3.4, 72.5 +/- 2.3; P less than .01; baseline, 2, 6, and 12 months, respectively, by repeated measures ANOVA). In all patients, significant increases in body weight, triceps skin fold, cholesterol, and fat mass were noted. Total body water content was not significantly increased after the 12-month period; therefore, the weight gain seen in these patients was water-free tissue, ie, fat mass."
CD009647,0,7002276,0,Eight cases of Legionnaires' disease.,"Eight patients with Legionnaires' disease were seen at one hospital in the summer of 1979. They presented in the same 12-day period with an illness of rapid onset characterized by fever, chills, malaise, profuse sweating and neurologic symptoms. Neutrophilia, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia and abnormal liver enzyme levels in the serum were usually noted. The roentgenographic findings in the lungs ranged from segmental interstitial infiltration to panlobar pneumonia. Seven patients responded to erythromycin treatment, though one died suddenly, presumably of unrelated cardiac disease. The other patient died of a combination of renal and respiratory failure, with pulmonary edema."
CD009647,0,1810744,0,Aging and heat tolerance at rest or during work.,"Collectively, the literature on heat tolerance suggests that middle-aged (45-64 year old) men and women are more work-heat intolerant, and suffer more physiological strain during heat acclimation, than do younger individuals. However, it is unclear whether the age differences in work-heat intolerance and physiological strain during heat acclimation are related to age per se or associated with other factors such as certain disease states, decreased physical activity, and/or lowered aerobic fitness. In contrast, the work-heat tolerance and physiological responses during heat acclimation of habitually active or aerobically trained middle-aged men are the same or better than younger individuals. The reviewed studies emphasize the importance of aerobic fitness and pertinent morphological factors, such as body fat, body weight, and surface area in maintaining work-heat tolerance with aging. Recent studies suggest that middle-aged and older men and women may be more susceptible to greater heat strain at physiologically significant levels of dehydration than those younger. However, additional research appears necessary to support this hypothesis. When the effects of chronic debilitating diseases in the elderly (greater than 64 years old) are minimized, their heat tolerance and thermoregulatory responses are comparable to those younger. In fact, healthy and well-acclimated elderly men and women appear to perform as well as those younger during desert walks in dry heat. This review shall discuss experimental observations from previously published studies concerning aging and heat tolerance or the physiological heat strain during heat acclimation at rest or during work; and, will suggest future research efforts needed to advance the area."
CD009647,0,1636025,0,Management of acute renal failure in the critically ill with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration.,"Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHD) has been increasingly utilized for renal replacement therapy in the critically ill. We report details of a prospective study of CVVHD in 12 critically ill patients (7 males, 5 females; mean age 60 years, range 30-72 years; Apache II score mean 27.4, range 21-35) with oligoanuric acute renal failure supported on CVVHD. Vascular access was obtained via double lumen subclavian or femoral cannulae. The mean pretreatment urea was 35.9 mM/L and the mean pretreatment creatinine was 559 microM/L. After 24 h of treatment on CVVHD these fell to a urea mean of 20.3 mM/L and a creatinine mean of 298 microM/L and remained stable at these values for the duration of CVVHD. The mean net ultrafiltrate volume was 551 mL/h, with a urea clearance mean of 26.6 mL/min and a creatinine clearance mean of 23.7 mL/min. There were no complications related to use of the blood pump module or extracorporeal circuit. Excellent hemodynamic stability, control of fluid and electrolyte balance, and azotaemia control were maintained while on CVVHD. Technique survival was 100%. Patient survival was 42%. We conclude that CVVHD is a safe, effective, and durable therapy for the treatment of acute renal failure in the critically ill and that it offers outstanding metabolic control and cardiovascular stability."

Optimal fluid balance to maintain optimal hemodynamic stability during hemodialysis (HD) procedure is essential. At the present time, hemodynamic stability is conventionally assessed as stability of macrocirculation, especially as maintenance of systemic blood pressure with no attention paid to peripheral perfusion. Peripheral ischemic vascular disease represents a serious problem with high mortality and morbidity. We estimated skin microcirculation changes during HD using new device, Laser Doppler Line Scanner (Moor Instruments, Devon, UK)."

He was referred to our department because of the evolution of weakness. Neurological examination on admission revealed weakness of the arms and legs, areflexia, and hypoesthesia of the lower legs. The straight leg raising test induced prominent radiating pain bilaterally. The level of sodium was 114 mEq/l, the plasma osmolality was 239 mOsm/kg, and the level of plasma antidiuretic hormone was 3.45 pg/ml. Other blood chemical values were unremarkable. The urine osmolality was 527 mOsm/kg. T1-weighted MR image with gadolinium showed thickening and enhancement of the nerve root. Nerve conduction study revealed compromised conduction with demyelinating features, and somatosensory evoked potential study could not show any potentials. He was diagnosed as having CIDP complicating with SIADH. An association between SIADH and AIDP has been much reported previously. To our knowledge, however, there has been no report of SIADH complicating with CIDP."
CD009647,0,2187664,0,Transepidermal water loss and skin surface hydration in the non invasive assessment of stratum corneum function.,"Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and water content of the stratum corneum, when measured simultaneously, provide important information regarding skin function. On the basis of the model presented, it is possible to differentiate dry senile skin from dry pathological skin (such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, irritant reaction), clinically involved or uninvolved. Pathological dry skin, because of the impaired barrier function is associated with increased TEWL and low corneum water content. Senile skin, on the other hand, shows both, decreased TEWL and stratum corneum water content. It is suggested that with this model it may be possible to differentiate uninvolved pathologic from healthy skin."
CD009647,0,21663576,0,Water-structuring technology with the molecular chaperone proteins: indicated application of the α-crystallin domains and imidazole-containing peptidomimetics in cosmetic skin care systems or dermatological therapeutic drug carrier formulations.,"Changes in structural proteins and hydration during aging are responsible for altered skin morphologic and mechanical properties manifested as wrinkling, sagging, loss of elasticity, and apparent dryness. Impairment in protein hydration may add to the ultrastructural, mechanical, and biochemical changes in structural proteins in the aged skin. At Innovative Vision Products, Inc., we have pioneered a molecular chaperone protein-activated therapeutic or cosmetic platform to enable simultaneous analysis of water-binding and structuring characteristics for biology-related or skin aging and skin disease-related pathways. This cutting-edge technology has changed the hydration of proteins in photoaged skin which so that they are more compact and interact with water to limited degree. The mechanisms of skin diseases, aging, and cellular and signaling pathways mediated by targeting with molecular chaperone protein(s) are considered. Skin lesions that are growing, spreading, or pigmented, and those that occur on exposed areas of skin are likely to be treated by these emerging pharmacological chaperones that could have cosmetic or dermatological benefits. Examples of such chaperones are anti-/trans-glycation-imidazole-containing peptidomimetic(s) (natural L-carnosine derivatives and mimetics) combined with the molecular chaperone protein α-crystallin derived from a natural source, brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) cysts, or with recombinant human αA-crystallin. This patented biotechnology represents an efficient tool with which to mitigate the consequences of free radical-induced skin damage. The article is organized to provide in one place all of the relevant technical information, such as high-performance nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance application tools, and to describe the entire process from sample preparation to data analysis, which is moving from biological studies to biotechnology batches of the product. The proposed biotechnology results in a superior therapeutic treatment using the studied skin-rejuvenating, water-structuring, visible smoothing, and revitalizing beauty-performance agents to meet current challenges in skin care."

CD009647,0,2321385,0,[Determination of fructosamine in chronic kidney diseases (dialysis-dependent patients)].,"The serum fructosamine normal range was confirmed. Correction to protein or albumin did not significantly affect the results. Therefore, correction of fructosamine values from patients with normal protein and albumin values would not improve the clinical significance of fructosamine. Fructosamine concentrations of heparin plasma from non-diabetics also fell within the serum fructosamine normal range. The fructosamine concentration from non-diabetic dialysis patients was significantly higher and more widely distributed than that of the reference collective despite normal blood glucose concentration. Relating fructosamine to protein had no substantial effect, whereas the differences were even increased when fructosamine was related to albumin. On the present stage of knowledge it might be considered to establish a reference interval for dialysis patients. It appears that the fructosamine estimation may then be successfully applied also to dialysis patients. Although dialysis resulted in hemoconcentration, the fructosamine concentration remained virtually unchanged. Referencing both values before and after dialysis to protein or albumin improved the correlation, but substantial differences were introduced as well. However, none of several parameters measured in parallel interfered to a degree which might explain such differences. In order to find a reasonable explanation for these findings further experiments are necessary."
CD009647,0,7573088,0,Combined fractional excretion of sodium and urea better predicts response to saline in hyponatremia than do usual clinical and biochemical parameters.,"The treatment of hyponatremic patients requires physicians to make a therapeutic choice between saline infusion and water restriction.

CD009647,0,11211764,0,[Efficacy of modified ultrafiltration in reoperation for valvular disease].,"We evaluated the efficacy of modified ultrafiltration (MUF) in reoperation for valvular disease. Fourteen patients were divide into two groups consisting of a control group (n = 6) and a MUF group (n = 8). MUF was carried out for fifteen minutes immediately after the completion of cardiopulmonary bypass. The blood flow through the ultrafilter was 300 ml/min and about 1,200 ml of water was removed. The hematocrit elevated significantly from 25% to 31% in the MUF group (p < 0.05). The percentage of the increase in body weight after the operation in the MUF group was significantly less than that in the control group (3.3 +/- 3.1% vs 8.3 +/- 4.3%, p < 0.05). The PaO2/FIO2 after the operation in the MUF group was significantly higher than that in the control group (376 +/- 125 mmHg vs 242 +/- 79 mmHg, p < 0.05). The duration of mechanical ventilation in the MUF group was significantly less than that in the control group (1.1 +/- 1.1 days vs 5.3 +/- 3.3 days, p < 0.05). In conclusion, MUF is useful to hemoconcentrate, reduce postoperative body weight gain and promote early recovery of pulmonary function in reoperation for valvular disease."
CD009647,0,15942094,0,Amphotericin B-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in a case of cryptococcemia.,"A 66-year-old woman with malignant lymphoma became neutropenic during chemotherapy and developed cryptococcemia. After amphotericin B had been commenced, she developed significant hypokalemia and polyuria, though her renal function remained stable. The laboratory findings showed no evidence of renal tubular acidosis. With vigorous water and potassium replacement, amphotericin B had been continued until the cumulative dose reached 2.5 g. After the cessation of amphotericin B, the hypokalemia and polyuria resolved promptly. Based on theses findings, she was diagnosed as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with hypokalemia and without renal tubular acidosis due to amphotericin B. This complication is usually reversible, and vigorous water and potassium replacement may allow completion of treatment by amphotericin B, though careful monitoring of body water balance and renal function is of importance."

CD009647,0,12544374,0,Improvement of sleep and pituitary-adrenal inhibition after subchronic intranasal vasopressin treatment in elderly humans.,"Subchronic intranasal treatment with argininevasopressin (AVP) has been shown to exert a strong ameliorating effect on sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) deficits in elderly. However, AVP is also a potent stimulus of the pituitary-adrenal stress system, which is usually inhibited during early, SWS-rich sleep. A disinhibition of pituitary-adrenal activity during sleep is correlated with aging and is considered a pathologic factor contributing to various age-related diseases. Here, we examined whether the beneficial effect of prolonged intranasal AVP administration on sleep in aged would be associated with a concomitant decrease in pituitary-adrenal inhibition and effects on other neuroendocrine features of sleep. Twenty-six healthy elderly (mean 72.9 yr) with mild sleep complaints were investigated in a placebo controlled double-blind study. One group was treated daily each morning and evening with intranasal AVP (2 x 20 IU) for 10 weeks, the other received placebo. During polysomnographical recordings taken at the beginning and end of the treatment period, blood was sampled every 15 min. Intranasal AVP increased SWS on average by +21.5 min (p<0.02). The effect persisted on the night after acute withdrawal of the peptide treatment with no rebound occurring. Notably, rather than increasing pituitary-adrenal activity, AVP decreased the early sleep cortisol nadir on average by 0.5 microg/dl (p<0.05). AVP did not induce any measurable changes in fluid balance or cardiovascular activity. Overall, results indicate a promoting effect of AVP on SWS in aged accompanied by a beneficial rather than impairing influence on the neuroendocrine pattern of sleep."

CD009647,0,8702212,1,Prediction of body composition in elderly men over 75 years of age.,"A comprehensive number of body composition predictions (involving weight, height, skinfold thicknesses, bioelectrical impedance and near-infrared interactance-NIRI) were evaluated against total body water (TBW from isotope dilution), in 23 randomly selected men over 75 years old, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), in 15 volunteers from this group. Comparisons were made between anthropometric and impedance methods for estimating limb muscle mass (obtained using DXA). Bias and 95% limits of agreement between measured TBW and DXA estimates were -2.1 kg and 3.1 kg, respectively (for fat, 5.4% and 6.1% body weight). Agreement between TBW predictions and reference measurements was remarkably variable, irrespective of whether TBW was predicted from TBW-specific equations or indirectly from estimates of fat or fat-free mass: for predictions using anthropometry, bias ranged from -4.7 kg to 1.6 kg and 95% limits of agreement from bias +/- 3.8 kg to +/- 5.0 kg; using impedance, bias was -8.8 kg to 3.2 kg and 95% limits of agreement were bias +/- 3.6 kg to +/- 7.8 kg; corresponding values for NIRI were -5.3 kg and +/- 5.4 kg. Although some non-age-specific equations appeared valid, age-specific equations generally predicted TBW better. Limb muscle mass (DXA) was predicted better using the segmental impedance method, from indices of limb muscle area (r = 0.76; SEE = 1.9 kg) and volume (r = 0.86; SEE = 1.6 kg), than by anthropometry alone (r = 0.61 and 0.71; SEE = 2.3 kg and 2.1 kg, respectively). In conclusion, some body composition predictions are unacceptable (at least for TBW) in older men, and care is recommended when selecting from these methods or equations. Also, the segmental impedance method is as good as, if not better than, anthropometry alone in predicting limb muscle mass (DXA) in older men."

CD009647,0,6338324,0,Renal disease in the elderly.,"With advancing age and in the absence of any disease, there is a significant alteration in kidney structure and a gradual decline in renal function. While RPF, GFR, and tubular reabsorptive capacity decrease with age, abnormal signs or symptoms cannot be detected under ordinary circumstances. The aging kidneys, however, have limited capacity to cope with rapid hemodynamic changes or disturbances in fluid and water balance, and this results in signs and symptoms of renal dysfunction. In the elderly, the incidence of primary renal diseases declines while the incidence of renal diseases secondary to systemic disease increases. AGN, while essentially a disease of the young, does occur in the older age group. RPGN, however, is the most common form of acute primary glomerulonephropathy, followed by membranous glomerulonephritis and glomerulosclerosis. Glomerulonephritis secondary to vasculitis and Wegener's granulomatosis and amyloidosis constitutes the most common secondary glomerulonephropathy. Drug-induced acute or chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy is seen more frequently in the geriatric age group because of the high incidence of multiple-drug treatment. There is a high incidence of ARF in the elderly which is frequently precipitated by hypovolemia, hypotension, nephrotoxic drugs, surgery, and anesthesia. Clinical manifestations of renal disease in the elderly are often atypical and nonspecific. Abnormal signs and symptoms are frequently attributed to extrarenal diseases or to previously existing disorders. For these reasons, renal disease in the elderly may go undetected. Serum creatinine level may remain within normal range despite a drop in GFR because of a reduction in muscle mass with aging. Therefore, creatinine clearance is a more accurate test for assessment of renal function. A decrease in creatinine clearance should not be ignored or attributed to aging; it is an indication for further renal evaluation."
CD009647,0,8466703,0,A comparison of two tests for the assessment of blood pressure responses to sodium.,"In order to assess the congruity of two different methods for the characterization of blood pressure responsivity to alterations in sodium and extracellular fluid volume balance, we studied 40 normotensive and hypertensive humans. All subjects were initially studied with a protocol of rapid sodium and volume expansion induced by intravenous administration of 0.9% saline (2 L over 4 h) followed by a day of sodium and volume depletion achieved by a low (10 mmol) sodium diet and three 40 mg oral doses of furosemide. Subsequently the subjects underwent a dietary protocol consisting of 5 days of a high (> or = 200 mmol/da) sodium diet followed by 7 days of a low (< or = 15 mmol/day) sodium diet. Blood pressure measurements as well as urinary sodium, potassium, and creatinine excretion measurements were made daily in both studies. A significant (P < .01) correlation was observed between the blood pressure responses to the separate techniques in the same individual. However, not all subjects responded in a similar qualitative fashion to the two maneuvers. The discrepancy was more frequent among subjects having a salt-resistant response to the rapid protocol. The renin response to sodium and volume depletion induced by the low sodium diet and furosemide correlated significantly (P < .001) with the subsequent blood pressure response to the low sodium diet. Subjects defined as salt-sensitive differed from the salt-resistant group by more sluggish renal adaptation to dietary sodium restriction. These findings demonstrate the congruity of two different approaches for the assessment of salt responsivity of blood pressure in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009647,0,3146715,0,Enhancement of renal function by a long-acting somatostatin analogue in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.,"The effect of the long-acting somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995 on renal function was investigated in nine cirrhotic patients with ascites, low urine output, low serum sodium, and normal serum creatinine. SMS 201-995, infused at 40 micrograms/h for 2 h, produced a significant increase in urine volume, a significant decrease in urine osmolality, and a significant increase in creatinine clearance. These changes, although less pronounced, persisted 24 h after the infusion of the analogue. No significant changes in free water clearance, urinary sodium excretion or serum sodium were noted. The effects of SMS 201-995 might be attributed to an improvement of renal haemodynamics through inhibition of vasoconstrictor systems acting in cirrhosis. It is concluded that SMS 201-995 may have a role in the treatment of the renal abnormalities complicating liver disease."

CD009647,0,11973168,0,Mitral Doppler indices are superior to two-dimensional echocardiographic and hemodynamic variables in predicting responsiveness of cardiac output to a rapid intravenous infusion of colloid.,"We hypothesized that mitral flow (MF) Doppler measurements could be used to predict cardiac output (CO) responsiveness to fluid challenge. Fourteen patients with normal systolic and diastolic function, scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, were evaluated as part of a pilot study in which preload was varied immediately before the beginning of cardiopulmonary bypass. A Validation group of 36 patients with different levels of systolic and diastolic function received a rapid infusion of 500 mL of 10% pentastarch. By use of transesophageal echocardiography, we measured left ventricular end-diastolic area, pulsed Doppler indices of the MF and pulmonary venous flow, and standard hemodynamic variables during acute volemic variations. A baseline measurement was first recorded, followed by measurements taken after a decrease (211 +/- 87 mL) and then an increase (176 +/- 149 mL) in preload (pilot study) and before and after 500 mL of pentastarch (validation study). In the pilot study, we found that a low velocity/time integral (VTI) E wave/A wave (E/A) ratio was associated with a larger increase in CO secondary to an increase in preload (r = 0.64, P < 0.05). Stepwise linear regression identified Doppler measurements of the mitral VTI E/A ratio as the most important variable to predict the increase in CO after fluid infusion. In the validation study, a mitral E/A ratio <1.26 before fluid infusion best predicted a 20% increase in stroke volume (receiver operating characteristic curve, 71%; P < 0.05), whereas no other hemodynamic or echocardiographic variable predicted preload responsiveness. We conclude that the MF Doppler filling pattern is an important factor to predict the increase in CO after intravascular fluid challenge in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting."
CD009647,0,6749348,0,Long-acting and short-acting diuretics in mild essential hypertension.,"A randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study was conducted in 14 patients with mild essential hypertension comparing different regimens of administration of the ""short-acting"" diuretic, chlorothiazide and the ""long-acting"" diuretic, chlorthalidone. There were 6 randomised treatment phases each of 5 weeks duration. For blood pressure recorded both at the Clinic and at home the most prominent effects were seen with standing blood pressure, for which significant reductions of mean blood pressure compared to the placebo phase were observed with chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily (-5 +/- 1 (SE) mm Hg - p less than 0.05), chlorthalidone 50 mg once daily (-7 +/- 1 mm Hg - p less than 0.01) and chlorothiazide 500 mg twice daily (-4 +/- 1 mm Hg - p less than 0.05). Blood pressure reductions with chlorothiazide 500 mg once daily and 1000 mg once daily were not significant. About half of the patients completing the trial could be described as ""non-responders"". The observed biochemical changes (reduced plasma potassium and chloride concentrations and increased plasma bicarbonate and urate concentrations) were most marked in the phases with the most prominent blood pressure effects. The result support the suggestion that a sustained diuretic effect is desirable when diuretics are used in the treatment of hypertension. This can be obtained by selection of the appropriate dosage regimen for a particular diuretic, such as once daily administration for ""long-acting"" and twice daily for ""short-acting"" thiazide-type diuretics."
CD009647,0,1324274,0,Efficacy of low-dose captopril in addition to furosemide and spironolactone in patients with decompensated liver disease during blunted diuresis.,"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is activated by diuretics and involved in the diuretic resistance of cirrhotic patients with ascites and oedema. In previous studies relatively high doses of captopril (25-400 mg daily) were unsuccessful in promoting diuresis and natriuresis in these patients. We analyzed the efficacy of a low dose of captopril in eight patients with massive ascites resistant to therapy of salt/fluid restriction and increasing doses of spironolactone and furosemide. Mean duration of diuretic use was 73 days (range 7-240 days). After at least 3 days of observation on 80 mg furosemide and 100 mg spironolactone only, captopril was added. Four out of eight patients responded with an increase in natriuresis and diuresis; daily dose of captopril was 20.6 mg in responders and 26.5 mg in non-responders. After the addition of captopril the mean weight change was -7.5 kg in responders and +0.25 kg in non-responders. Mean urinary sodium output in responders increased from 72.8 (S.D. = 35.2) to 128.5 (63.5) mmol within 10 days. Increased diuresis in responders made diuretic reduction necessary: mean furosemide from 80 to 53.3 mg, and mean spironolactone from 100 to 68.1 mg. Creatinine clearances remained stable. High levels of plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and angiotensin-II were found in all patients. Non-responders showed more severe hyponatremia and higher vasopressin levels.

In this single-blind, randomized, parallel study in 20 men over 18 years of age, significant diuresis and increased excretion of sodium, potassium, and chloride occurred with both drugs. Weight loss was slight but significant within groups but not between drug treatments. Osmolality was significantly decreased after both treatments due to the magnitude of urine volume. Sodium/potassium ratio was significantly increased up to 120 minutes after both treatments. Creatinine excretion and clearance were increased after treatment with bumetanide but not significantly. In the furosemide group, the increase was first significant but after 90 minutes remained decreased. Supine and standing blood pressure and pulse rate changes were negligible. EKG monitoring revealed no abnormalities. No consistent alterations of laboratory tests were identified after treatment, nor were any important clinical adverse responses recognized. A 15-decibel unilateral high-frequency hearing loss was observed following bumetanide treatment in one patient with prior evidence of ear disease."
CD009647,0,20802909,0,Risk index proposal to predict atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.,Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication following cardiac surgery and is associated with an increased patient morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to develop a risk index proposal to predict AF after cardiac surgery.
CD009647,0,3596973,0,Massive resection of the small bowel.,"A report is presented on patients (no. = 43. 64 +/- 9 years, 30 men and 13 women) subjected to a massive small bowel resection (69 +/- 25 cm intestine left). The most usual indication was thromboembolism of the arteria mesenterica superioris, but there were also patients who had had intestinal by-pass, occlusion, trauma, tumor and invagination. The preoperative diagnosis was based on peritonitis, increasing abdominal symptoms, paralytic ileus, shock and fever. Fluid and electrolyte treatment, postoperative intensive care, intestinal decompression, parenteral nutrition and antibiotics were also employed. Postoperatively there was a significant decrease in serum protein (SP) (63 +/- 11 vs. 43 +/- 9 g/l) and blood hemoglobin (150 +/- 10 vs. 106 +/- 8 g/l) concentrations (Hb) and hematocrit (CHCT) (0.44 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.10). Also the number of patients with subnormal SP and Hb increased from five to nineteen and from fourteen to thirty-two, respectively. The operative mortality (within 30 days) was 60 percent (26/43). Those who survived were younger (59 +/- 8 vs. 67 +/- 9 years) and had higher SP (87 +/- 12 vs. 47 +/- 11 g/l), blood leukocyte count (22 +/- 6 vs. 14 +/- 5 X 10(9] and lower peroperative blood loss (291 +/- 43 vs. 448 +/- 67) than those who died. During the one to 14 year follow-up time nine (21% of all patients and 59% of those who were discharged) were still alive. Thus the patients subjected to a massive small bowel resection are old, have atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and preoperatively have peritonitis or severe abdominal complaints and an impaired nutritional state and fluid balance."
CD009647,0,12942607,0,[The parameters of physico-chemical properties of bile and urine in the diagnosis of pancreatitis associated with cholelithiasis].,"Specific electrical conductance (SEC) of the hepatic bile in 94 patients with cholelithiasis and concomitant pancreatitis was increased (p < 0.001) and depended on the degree of cholestasis and the morpho-functional state of the liver. The value of SEC of the intraoperative bile higher than 193 S/m is taken for a criterion of the diagnostics of biliary pancreatitis. The electrical conductance of urine during the first 4 days of observation decreased in patients with acute pancreatitis (p < 0.05), impaired carbohydrate metabolism and concomitant renal dysfunction. The value of SEC of urine lower than 238 S/m corresponds to acute pancreatitis. The investigation of physico-chemical indices of biological liquids in patients with a pathology of the pancreato-biliary system allows to objectively control the course of the disease and to correct the treatment methods."
CD009647,0,19078903,0,Behavior of B-type natriuretic peptide during mechanical ventilation and spontaneous breathing after extubation.,The behavior of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is assessed during mechanical ventilation (MV) and spontaneous breathing after extubation in critical patients.
CD009647,0,17381532,0,Hypoalbuminemia is also a marker of fluid excess determined by bioelectrical impedance parameters in dialysis patients.,"Hypoalbuminemia may be secondary to volume expansion conditions and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is an accurate, non-invasive method to measure body composition, especially the water compartments in humans. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the relationship between serum albumin concentration (SA) and hydration state measured by whole BIA. The study investigated 108 non-selected patients (73 on hemodialysis, 35 on peritoneal dialysis) with a mean age of 61.4 +/- 15.6 years, 42.7% of whom were female. The patients were allotted to groups according to their SA: Group 1, < or = 3.5 g/dL; Group 2, 3.6-4.0 g/dL; and Group 3, >4.0 g/dL. The BIA parameters used included: total body water, intracellular water (ICW), extracellular water (ECW), phase angle (PA), body cell mass (BCM), ICW/ECW ratio and ICW/ECW ratio patients/controls (fluid index). Seventy-five healthy volunteers formed the control group. A strong positive correlation was found between the PA and fluid index (r (2) = 0.993, P < 0.001), as well as between the PA and SA (r = 0.386, P < 0.001), and the ICW/ECW ratio and SA (r = 0.227, P < 0.001). The ECW was negatively correlated with SA (r = -0.330, P < 0.001). Every 0.1 g/dL decrease in SA was associated with a 0.33 L increase in ECW. Group 1 patients had lower reactance (P = 0.006), PA (P < 0.001), BCM (P = 0.012), fluid index (P < 0.001) and ICW/ECW ratio (P = 0.015), and an increased ECW (NS) than groups 2 and 3. We conclude that hypoalbuminemia is also a marker of fluid excess. The SA is associated to the fluid index and the PA allows assessment of the dry weight and its variations in an individualized manner in dialysis patients."
CD009647,0,3563882,0,Mesenteric venous thrombosis--1911 to 1984.,"The objective of this study was to identify those patients in whom mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) is likely to develop and to review the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities, and patient outcome. We present a review of the literature from 1911 to 1984 with respect to 372 patients with MVT, including five of our own patients. Data on 99 of these patients were obtained from autopsy reports and were not included in the study. This disease is common in the sixth and seventh decades of life, with 81% of these older patients having associated illnesses. MVT involves segments of the small bowel, but rarely of the colon, with hemorrhagic infarcts rather than gangrene. This disease does not conform to a pattern, although a prodromal period of days or weeks of abdominal pain (which is usually out of proportion to physical findings), marked leukocytosis, and dehydration are all highly suggestive of MVT. Serosanguineous fluid obtained by means of peritoneal tap is a useful diagnostic tool. A high index of suspicion, early diagnosis, and prompt surgical intervention with the addition of anticoagulants seems to improve survival and reduce recurrence."
CD009647,0,9825393,0,Circadian antidiuretic hormone variation in elderly men complaining of persistent nocturia after urinary flow obstruction removal.,"Persistence of nocturia after prostatic resection in healthy patients without symptoms referred to residual bladder instability and to pathological polyuria seems to be caused by an increased urine production at night. The more accreditate mechanism involved is the relevant decreased ADH secretion pattern which occurs at night. In our study, patients with nocturnal poliuria showed significantly low plasmatic vasopressin levels compared with a control group. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the persistence of nocturia after prostatic resection in healthy patients, without symptoms referred due to residual bladder instability and important polyuria, could be due to a decrease or a lack of increase in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) nocturnal levels following increased urine production at night. Serum ADH, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and osmolality were assessed at 4-h intervals in 12 patients complaining of residual nocturia (group A) and in a control group of 13 patients who had undergone a complete resolution of nocturia after prostate ablation (group B). In the 25 patients involved in the study (mean age 65.8 years), no significant differences were observed in the two groups concerning mean age (67.5 years for group A, 64 years for group B). Mean nocturnal urine volume (1080 +/- 490 ml) in group A patients was significantly higher than in group B (500 +/- 100 ml) (p < 0.001), while no significant differences were found in diurnal diuresis. Mean plasma vasopressin levels of the 12 patients showing an increased nocturnal micturition were found to be significantly lower at all 4-h intervals when compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Individual fluctuations in serum osmolality were slight and insignificant within the normal range in all patients. The diurnal variation of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was within the reference limits for all subjects during the 24-h period. Our results lead us to believe that residual nocturia after prostatic resection seems to be caused by an increased urine production at night due to a decreased ADH secretion pattern."
CD009647,0,23276277,0,Prognostic value of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its potential role in guiding fluid therapy in critically ill septic patients.,"The prognostic role of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in septic patients is controversial. The study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of BNP in critically ill septic patients. Furthermore, because BNP is primarily released from ventricles in response to myocardial stretch, the second aim of the study was to test whether the change in BNP was correlated to the amount of fluid balance."
CD009647,0,9329367,0,Using dilution techniques and multifrequency bioelectrical impedance to assess both total body water and extracellular water at baseline and during recombinant human growth hormone (GH) treatment in GH-deficient adults.,"Due to the use of various, and mostly indirect, methods to estimate total body water (TBW) and extracellular water (ECW), there is no agreement about whether body water distribution, i.e. the ECW to TBW ratio, is normal in GH-deficient (GHD) subjects at baseline and during recombinant human GH (rhGH) treatment. We studied body water distribution in 14 patients with adult-onset GHD and in 28 healthy controls. We also investigated the effect of GH replacement therapy for 4 and 52 weeks on body water distribution. All patients started with a dose of 0.6 IU rhGH/day for the first 4 weeks. After 52 weeks, the dose varied between 0.6-1.8 IU/day. TBW and ECW were measured by dilution of deuterium and bromide, respectively. Both parameters were also estimated using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance (BIA). Patients with GHD had significantly lower ECW and TBW than healthy controls. In addition, the ECW to TBW ratio was significantly lower in GHD patients than in healthy controls. Four weeks of GH treatment significantly increased body weight, TBW, ECW, and ECW/TBW. A further increase in TBW, but not ECW, was found after 52 weeks of treatment. The mean increases in TBW and ECW from the baselines were 2.5 +/- 0.3 and 2.0 +/- 0.3 L, respectively. The correlation coefficient and the estimated reliability between measured and estimated TBW and ECW at any time point were all high (> 0.91 and > 0.95, respectively). In general, both ECW and TBW were overestimated by multifrequency BIA in GHD adults. During treatment, the overestimation of both ECW and TBW diminished. The estimation error was correlated with the level of the body water compartment and the ratio of ECW to TBW. The estimated change in ECW with rhGH treatment was underestimated by multifrequency BIA. We conclude that GHD adults have lower ECW and TBW and a lower ECW to TBW ratio, as measured by dilution techniques. The ECW to TBW ratio can be normalized within 4 weeks of rhGH treatment at a dose of 0.6 IU/day. Finally, we conclude that multifrequency impedance measurements do not give valid estimates of body water compartments in the follow-up of patients with GHD."
CD009647,0,8225698,0,Amlodipine in ambulatory hypertensive patients: humoral and haemodynamic effects.,"In order to evaluate the mid-term effects of amlodipine, a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, as well as its effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), on water and electrolyte balance, on urinary excretion of albumin (UAE) and on lipid metabolism, thirteen hypertensive patients (2 M, 11 F, mean age 54 years) were studied in the course of 24 weeks of therapy with amlodipine at 5-10 mg/day. Pre-therapy and periodically during therapy, the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded in the sitting orthostatic positions (2 measurements). Laboratory tests were performed at times O and at 24 wks with the patients fasting for at least 12 h in the recumbent position. The tests included: plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone (PA), serum angiotensin converting enzyme (SACE), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood creatinine, plasma electrolytes (Na, K, Cl), triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC) and HDL-cholesterol (HDLC), along with 24-h urine samples (with sterile urine) to determine UAE. The results of this study demonstrate that SBP, DBP and HR were significantly reduced during the 24 wks of therapy. The water and electrolyte and renal function were not modified. After treatment the levels of TC were significantly reduced. No change was observed in the RAAS, while the mean levels of UAE were reduced though not significantly. In conclusion, amlodipine was shown to be effective for the therapy of hypertension; it does not cause reflex tachycardia even in mid-term therapy and was effective in reducing TC levels."
CD009647,0,21165296,0,Desmopressin is an effective treatment for mixed nocturia with nocturnal polyuria and decreased nocturnal bladder capacity.,"To investigate the efficacy and safety of desmopressin in patients with mixed nocturia, Patients aged ≥ 18 yr with mixed nocturia (≥ 2 voids/night and a nocturnal polyuria index [NPi] >33% and a nocturnal bladder capacity index [NBCi] >1) were recruited. The optimum dose of oral desmopressin was determined during a 3-week dose-titration period and the determined dose was maintained for 4 weeks. The efficacy was assessed by the frequency-volume charts and the sleep questionnaire. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in the number of nocturnal voids (NV) compared with baseline. Among 103 patients enrolled, 94 (79 men and 15 women) were included in the analysis. The proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in NV was 68 (72%). The mean number of NV decreased significantly (3.20 to 1.34) and the mean nocturnal urine volume, nocturia index, NPi, and NBCi decreased significantly. The mean duration of sleep until the first NV was prolonged from 118.4 ± 44.1 to 220.3 ± 90.7 min (P<0.001). The overall impression of patients about their quality of sleep improved. Adverse events occurred in 6 patients, including one asymptomatic hyponatremia. Desmopressin is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for mixed nocturia."

Proliferative reticulo granulomatous process of hypothalamic origin (author's transl)].,"The authors report the anatomical and clinical findings in a 65 year old patient with a lesion in the hypothalamus presenting mainly as disorders in heat and water regulation. Disorders in heat regulation dominated the clinical picture, in relation to a poikilothermia. Conservation of reactivity to pyrogenic bacteria is debatable. Inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ISADH) by a direct effect on the supraoptico-hypophyseal aixs can account for the water and electrolyte disturbances. The anatomical lesions, due to hypothalamic changes, can be included in the circumscribed proliferative reticuloses of the CNS having a pseudo-inflammatory histological appearance."

CD009647,0,18471092,0,Hypovolaemia after glucose/insulin infusions in volunteers.,"High-dose intravenous infusion of 5% glucose promotes rebound hypoglycaemia and hypovolaemia in healthy volunteers. To study whether such effects occur in response to glucose/insulin, 12 healthy firemen (mean age, 39 years) received three infusions over 1-2 h that contained 20 ml of 2.5% glucose/kg of body weight, 5 ml of 10% glucose/kg of body weight with 0.05 unit of rapid-acting insulin/kg of body weight, and 4 ml of 50% glucose/kg of body weight with 1 unit of insulin/kg of body weight. The plasma glucose concentration and plasma dilution were compared at 5-10 min intervals over 4 h. Regardless of the amount of administered fluid and whether insulin was given, the plasma glucose concentration decreased to hypoglycaemic levels within 30 min of the infusion ending. The plasma dilution closely mirrored plasma glucose and became negative by approx. 5%, which indicates a reduction in the plasma volume. These alterations were only partially restored during the follow-up period. A linear relationship between plasma glucose and plasma dilution was most apparent when the infused glucose had been dissolved in only a small amount of fluid. For the strongest glucose/insulin solution, this linear relationship had a correlation coefficient of 0.77 (n=386, P<0.0001). The findings of the present study indicate that a redistribution of water due to the osmotic strength of the glucose is the chief mechanism accounting for the hypovolaemia. It is concluded that infusions of 2.5%, 10% and 50% glucose, with and without insulin, in well-trained men were consistently followed by long-standing hypoglycaemia and also by hypovolaemia, which averaged 5%. These results emphasize the relationship between metabolism and fluid balance."
CD009647,0,16729882,0,Fluorophotometry as a diagnostic tool for the evaluation of dry eye disease.,"Dry eye disease is a common debilitating ocular disease. Current diagnostic tests used in dry eye disease are often neither sensitive nor reproducible, making it difficult to accurately diagnose and determine end points for clinical trials, or evaluate the usefulness of different medications in the treatment of dry eye disease. The recently developed fluorophotometer can objectively detect changes in the corneal epithelium by quantitatively measuring its barrier function or permeability. The purpose of the study is to investigate the use of corneal fluorescein penetration measured by the fluorophotometer as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of dry eye patients."

CD009647,0,4817188,0,Laxative-induced diarrhoea: a continuing clinical problem.,"Seven women spent an average of 127 days in hospital and were extensively investigated, including a laparotomy, before their complaints of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and weight loss were shown to be due to excessive taking of laxatives. All denied taking laxatives and in none were the characteristic features of the effects of cathartics on the colon seen on sigmoidoscopy or radiological examination.Hypokalaemia and other electrolyte abnormalities were common and were thought to be due to a combination of severe diarrhoea and vomiting. The rectal mucosa was seen to be abnormal on biopsy only in the three patients who had taken senna preparations. The diagnosis was not easy and was finally established either by analysis of the urine and stools or by searching the patient's ward locker."
CD009647,0,3322820,0,Water excretion in the elderly.,"Osmoreceptor sensitivity is enhanced in healthy elderly subjects and AVP secretion is increased, relative to that of younger subjects, when plasma osmolality rises. Increased AVP secretion/unit increase in plasma tonicity reflects a decrease in collecting tubule sensitivity to AVP by an as yet unknown mechanism in the aged kidney. This change in sensitivity is not completely offset by increased ADH release, so that maximum Uosm achievable under hydropenic conditions (concentrating ability) is reduced in the elderly. CH2O in older subjects decreases in proportion to the fall in GFR; thus, CH2O is intact in older subjects with preserved GFR. In subjects with age-related reductions in GFR, minimal Uosm achievable is usually less than 100 mOsm per kg H2O and thus usually sufficient to meet the demands of solute-free water intake so that plasma hypo-osmolarity does not result. Increasing exposure of the elderly to pharmacologic agents that reduce CH2O is primarily responsible for the impression that aged patients are at increased risk for hyponatremia."

CD009647,0,6692548,0,Hyponatremia: a diagnostic problem.,"Hyponatremia, a common clinical problem, may result from a wide variety of causes. Treatment can vary from fluid restriction to rehydration, depending on the pathogenesis of the disorder. Essential to evaluation of hyponatremic patients is correct estimation of the status of the extracellular fluid volume, because this determines the type of therapy: a patient who is hypovolemic will not benefit from fluid restriction; a euvolemic patient should not be ""rehydrated."" To distinguish between these two conditions requires a searching history and clinical examination, including measurement of the blood pressure both while the subject is standing and lying. Not all patients with the classical biochemical features of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of vasopressin (low plasma [Na+] and osmolality, high urinary [Na+] and osmolality) will have the disorder, because these same features may also be present in other hyponatremic disorders, including hypovolemic hyponatremia."
CD009647,0,3046266,0,Renal function in the elderly.,"Renal mass, glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow decline with age. Since the renal tubules also decrease in mass, the aging kidney is less able to compensate for changes in fluid balance. Because of changes in the renin-aldosterone system, the elderly may have problems maintaining sodium and potassium balance. Physicians must be aware of the implications of these changes in renal function when they prescribe medications or order intravenous fluids for elderly patients."
CD009647,0,14608923,0,[Assessment of extracellular fluid in cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass].,"Extracellular fluid (ECF) was assessed before and after the cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), by means of a bioimpedance spectrum analyzer to see volumes of the fluid based on changes of the impedance to various frequencies. Difference between the levels before and after the operation was divided by body weight to study about a % BW. Simultaneously its relation to the lung compliance [tidal volume/(peak inspiratory pressure-end expiratory pressure)] was studied. Mean age of the 18 patients was 59.1 +/- 19 years old. ECF was assessed before to 24 hours after the operation continuously and once more after 48 hours. Mean CPB time was 165 +/- 52 minutes, and aortic cross clamp time was 121 +/- 4 minutes. A remarkable increase of ECF was noted immediately after the operation, which further increased gradually till arriving at the peak 4 hours after the operation (4.52 +/- 1.8% BW). Then it gradually decreased to 0.641 +/- 2.7% BW 48 hours later. Lung compliance measured at the same time showed the lowest level 6 hours after the operation. It was known that the bioimpedance spectrum analysis is a simple and non-invasive method, which enables to monitor the vital stable before and after the operation."
CD009647,0,9630200,0,Liddle's syndrome in an elderly woman.,"A 78-year-old woman with hypertension was hospitalized with acute bronchitis. However, she was also found to have hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Detailed examination showed a low plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration. A provisional diagnosis of Liddle's syndrome was established and the patient was successfully treated with triamterene. Although Liddle's syndrome is generally considered an inherited hypertensive disease found in young people, a review of the literature indicated that muscle weakness is an important clinical finding in elderly patients with this disease. Liddle's syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hypertension even in elderly individuals."
CD009647,0,4095046,0,Plasma arginine vasopressin in hyponatraemic patients receiving diuretics.,"Random estimations of plasma arginine vasopressin concentration were undertaken in 6 non-oedematous patients receiving diuretic therapy for hypertension, who were admitted to hospital with severe hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia resolved within 2 weeks of discontinuing the diuretic. Measurable amounts of plasma arginine vasopressin were detected in all 6 patients. Sequential biochemical measurements in one patient, performed when plasma sodium concentration and osmolality were returning to the normal range, disclosed that urine osmolality remained higher than plasma osmolality during the first 5 days, when urine volume and sodium excretion were low. Thus the rise in plasma sodium was not initially related to water diuresis. The ability to excrete a water load was severely limited on the fifth day, but improved progressively by the tenth and seventeenth days. Diuretic-induced hyponatraemia is associated with incomplete suppression of anti-diuretic hormone secretion arising from non-osmotic stimulation, in conjunction with transient impairment of renal diluting ability which could be due to net sodium deficit."

CD009647,0,6754156,0,The role of aldosterone in the response to treatment of primary hypertension.,"The role of the renin-aldosterone axis in mediating responses to antihypertensive treatment was examined in patients with essential hypertension treated with propranolol (n=50) or chlorthalidone (n=50). Control plasma renin activity tended to be predictive of the response to treatment: it correlated with the diastolic blood pressure changes produced by both the renin-lowering agent, propranolol (r=-.43, P less than 0.001), and the diuretic, chlorthalidone (r= .48, P less than 0.001). However, when patients were divided into responders (fall in diastolic blood pressure of greater than 10%) and non-responders, the treatment-induced changes in aldosterone excretion rate appeared to be more important than the changes in renin in determining outcome. During propranolol there was no difference between the renin changes in the responders (n=21) and the non-responders (n=29), but aldosterone fell significantly more (P less than 0.025) in the responders than in the non-responders. Similarly, renin changes during chlorthalidone were not markedly different between the two groups, but the increase in aldosterone excretion in the non-responders was significantly greater (P less than 0.001) than in the responders (n=25). Thus, regardless of the treatment used, responders were characterized by having lower levels of aldosterone during therapy than non-responders. This possible role for aldosterone in influencing blood pressure changes was not related to clinically measurable effects on fluid and electrolyte balance; it has been conjectured that this pressor effect of aldosterone could reflect a direct action in the peripheral circulation."
CD009647,0,23013432,0,Stimulated sweating as a therapy to reduce interdialytic weight gain and improve potassium balance in chronic hemodialysis patients: a pilot study.,"Controlling the extracellular volume in hemodialysis patients is a difficult task. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of different methods of stimulated sweating to reduce mean interdialytic weight gain (IWG), to improve blood pressure regulation, and potassium/urea balance. Two center, crossover pilot study. In Lausanne, hemodialysis patients took four hot-water baths a week, 30 minutes each, on nondialysis days during 1 month. In Sfax, patients visited the local Hammam Center four times a week. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded, and weekly laboratory analysis was performed. Results were compared with a preceding 1-month control period. In Lausanne, five patients (all men, median age 55 years) participated. Bathing temperature was (mean ± standard deviation) 41.2 ± 3°C and sweating-induced weight loss 600 ± 500 g. Mean IWG (control vs. intervention period) decreased from 2.3 ± 0.9 to 1.8 ± 1 kg (P = 0.004), Systolic blood pressure from 139 ± 21 to 136 ± 22 mmHg (P = 0.4), and diastolic blood pressure form 79 ± 12 to 75 ± 13 mmHg (P = 0.08); antihypertensive therapy could be reduced from 2.8 ± 0.4 to 1.9 ± 0.5 antihypertensive drugs per patient (P = 0.01). In Sfax (n = 9, median age 46 years), weight loss per Hammam session was 420 ± 100 g. No differences were found in IWG or BP, but predialysis serum potassium level decreased from 5.9 ± 0.8 to 5.5 ± 0.9 mmol/L (P = 0.04) and urea from 26.9 ± 6 to 23.1 ± 6 mmol/L (P = 0.02). Hot-water baths appear to be a safe way to reduce IWG in selected hemodialysis patients. Hammam visits reduce serum potassium and urea levels, but not IWG. More data in larger patient groups are necessary before definite conclusion can be drawn."

CD009647,0,2946555,0,Continuous pump-driven hemofiltration associated with a decline in alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide.,"The levels of alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the right atrium, pulmonary artery, radial artery, and superior vena cava plasma were measured by radioimmunoassay in eight patients with volume-expansion due to different diseases. The alpha-ANP levels were significantly increased, but became decreased after fluid removal by continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. When all alpha-ANP concentrations of different anatomical locations and hemodynamic variables were grouped, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure correlated significantly with all alpha-ANP groups, whereas right atrial mean pressure correlated with alpha-ANP levels in pulmonary artery plasma only. Alpha-ANP concentrations were distinctly lower in superior vena cava plasma than in plasma from the right atrium, pulmonary artery, and radial artery. Since alpha-ANP plays an important role in the homeostasis of sodium and fluid balance, measurement of alpha-ANP concentrations, particularly in right atrium, pulmonary artery, or radial artery plasma, might provide valuable information on the status of the critically ill."

CD009647,0,10390586,0,Preoperative assessment of body fluid disturbances in patients with obstructive jaundice.,"Postoperative renal dysfunction in obstructive jaundice (OJ) patients has been associated with hypovolemia and depletion of the extracellular water compartment (ECW). The aim of the study was to evaluate the preoperative status of body compartments in OJ patients measured by two methods. In a prospective study 39 OJ patients (11 benign and 28 malignant obstructions) were investigated, with 15 healthy subjects used as a control group (CG). Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) determinations and values derived from anthropometric measurements were used to assess body compartment status. The coefficient of variation of BIA was below 4% in both OJ and CG subjects. No differences were found in intracellular water. However total body water (TBW) and ECW were reduced in OJ patients (50.5 +/- 4.6 vs. 56 +/- 8% body weight, p = 0.05; and 21 +/- 4.5 vs. 23.8 +/- 2.5% body weight, p < 0.05, respectively). There were no differences between benign and malignant obstructions. Seventy four percent of OJ patients had an ECW volume below the mean +/- 2 SD in the CG subjects. Anthropometric and BIA determinations correlated closely for TBW measurements in both CG (r = 0.92, p < 0.001) and OJ patients (r = 0.91, p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis also showed that for TBW the BIA was in agreement with anthropometry. In the present study, BIA offered a good correlation with anthropometric determinations and was a reliable method for body fluid disturbances assessment in jaundiced patients."

CD009647,0,15378137,0,Effect of nesiritide on length of hospital stay in patients with decompensated heart failure.,"We examined the effect of nesiritide, administered as initial therapy, on length of hospital stay (LOS) and renal function through a retrospective analysis of 129 consecutive admissions to the coronary care unit in 98 patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Nesiritide was infused during 58 admissions (nesiritide group) while other therapies, not including nesiritide, were used during 71 admissions (non-nesiritide group). Although the nesiritide group showed lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction and systolic blood pressure, higher serum creatinine, and a longer QRS interval, the LOS of this group was significantly shorter compared to the non-nesiritide group (3.91 +/- 1.3 vs 4.77 +/- 1.7 days, P = .0023). Both groups were similar with respect to body weight change (negative fluid balance), a slight decrease in blood urea nitrogen, and unchanged serum creatinine. Nesiritide as an initial therapy for treatment of congestive heart failure results in a more rapid hospital discharge without compromising renal function."
CD009647,0,18557242,0,Mechanisms of renal tubular defects in old age.,"The mechanisms of renal tubular dysfunction in old age have been examined in twenty-eight clinically healthy elderly subjects without infection, and in fourteen subjects of similar age with laboratory evidence of intrarenal infection. The data were compared with those from thirteen clinically healthy young subjects. Studied were: proximal tubular (Tm(PAH)) and distal tubular (CH2O) activity, minimal and maximal osmolal U/P ratios, maximal osmolal excretion in hydropenia, and GFR levels under standard hydration and under water-loading. The reduction of GFR in old age is evident particularly in men under conditions of standard hydration: it is accentuated in the presence of renal infection. Proximal tubular activity is also significantly lower in elderly men, especially if they have chronic bacteriuria. The reduction is closely related to GFR levels, with identical Tm(PAH):C(in) ratios in all groups. This supports the intact nephron hypothesis for this part of the nephron. Distal tubular activity is depressed in old age in both sexes proportionately more than proximal tubular activity or the GFR. The lower CH2O: GFR ratios imply a selective distal tubular damage. Maximal osmolal U/P ratios in hydropenia are significantly higher in the young (mean 367) than in either the elderly non-infected (mean 279) or the elderly infected subjects (mean 212). Conversely, minimal U/P ratios in water-loading are lower in the young (mean 0.247) than in either elderly group (means 0.418 and 0.668). Osmolal excretion in hydropenia is not different between the groups, but urine flows in water-loading clearly separate them. The data indicate that simple functions of the distal-collecting tubule (e.g. the CH2O), are less affected in old age than are functions involving several medullary structures (as is the maximal U(osm) or U/P ratio). They suggest that the main impairment of the distal tubular cell involves the failure to achieve a proper osmotic gradient between tubular fluid and blood, rather than an inability to excrete or re-absorb an adequate amount of solute. Finally, it appears that renal infection aggravates the larger glomerular and proximal tubular deficits observed in non-infected men: it depresses distal tubular function equally in both sexes."

CD009647,0,6191385,0,"Changes in oncotic pressure, osmolality and electrolytes following transurethral resection of the prostate using glycine as irrigating solution.","Thirteen patients undergoing resection of benign prostatic hyperplasia were given furosemide 40 mg at the end of the procedure. The changes in body weight, colloid oncotic pressure (COP), osmolality, electrolyte concentrations and several haematological variables were compared with the values of 13 patients treated similarly, but without furosemide. During the operation there was an estimated mean absorption of 300 ml of irrigating fluid (glycine 1.5%). There was a significant peroperative decrease in serum sodium concentration, osmolality, COP, and haemoglobin concentration in both groups. The furosemide group had a more rapid return of COP towards preoperative values, and this group did also approach the preoperative weight more rapidly than the control group. In 10 selected patients variations in the total aminoacid pattern were measured. There was a significant increase in glycine concentration, with the maximum increase ten times the preoperative value. In the absence of uncontrolled bleeding, the resorption of fluid during TUR leads to hypervolemia and reduction in serum sodium and COP. This may lead to the TUR syndrome, as illustrated by one of our patients. Treatment in the symptomatic patient consists of reduction of circulating blood volume and when this is achieved, hypertonic saline may be beneficial if there are neurological symptoms."
CD009647,0,21406321,0,The glucocorticoid in acute decompensated heart failure: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde?,"Glucocorticoid administration is not recommended in patients with heart failure because of its related sodium and fluid retention. However, previous experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoids can also induce a diuretic effect and improve renal function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) with refractory diuretic resistance. We report the case of a 65-year-old man with a known diagnosis of aortic stenosis, systolic ventricular dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who was admitted for ADHF. After 3 days, during which resistance to conventional therapy was observed, intravenous methylprednisolone (60 mg/d) was added to ongoing medical treatment. Three days after the onset of glucocorticoid therapy, daily urine volume progressively increased (up to 5.8 L/d). Concurrently, signs and symptoms of congestion improved, the weight and brain natriuretic peptide plasma levels decreased (−7 kg and −46%, respectively) and glomerular filtration rate increased (+26%). Bioimpedance vector analysis showed a net reduction of fluid content (from 88.4% to 73.6% of hydration at discharge). In conclusion, this case report suggests that in a patient with ADHF and congestion resistant to diuretic therapy, glucocorticoid administration is safe and associated with improvement in congestion, neurohormonal status, and renal function. These data support the possible usefulness of glucocorticoids in this setting."

In this population, skin integrity is frequently compromised as a result of under- or over-hydration, which may cause serious complications. Plans of care must include preventive efforts such as the use of barriers and protectants including zinc oxide preparations, petrolatum- and silicone-based ointments and creams, liquid-forming products, adhesive dressings, fluid managers, skin cleansers, and moisturizers. A team approach that includes the patient, caregivers, and healthcare professionals is needed to address patient concerns regarding independence/dependence, utilization of support systems and services, pain, and control of body fluids. The healthcare provider's role in this team should emphasize continuity of care, patient satisfaction, and product selection - all vital to protecting skin integrity."

The reference method, a three-compartment (3C) model using body density by air displacement plethysmography and total body water (TBW) by H(2)18O dilution (3C-H(2)18O), showed a decrease in percent body fat (%BF) from 51.4 to 34.6%. Fat-free mass hydration was significantly higher than the reference value (0.738) in extreme obesity (0.756; P < 0.001) but not after weight reduction (0.747; P = 0.16). %BF by H(2)18O dilution and air displacement plethysmography differed significantly from %BF by 3C-H(2)18O in extreme obesity (P < 0.05) and 3C models using (2)H(2)O or bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to determine TBW improved mean %BF estimates over most other methods at both time points. BIA results varied with the equation used, but BIA better predicted %BF than did BMI at both time points. All methods except BIA using the Segal equation were comparable to the reference method for determining changes over time. A simple 3C model utilizing air displacement plethysmography and BIA is useful for clinical evaluation in this population."

CD009647,0,8502336,0,Effect of urea and indomethacin intake on solute excretion in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.,"Our purpose was to compare the effect of urea and indomethacin on solute excretion in hyponatremic patients with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). In 6 patients (serum Na: 126 +/- 3 mmol/l), the intake of urea (0.1 g/kg) induced a decrease in sodium excretion while urine osmolality, urine flow and osmotic clearance (Cosm) did not change. In the control group, the urinary flow and Cosm were increased as expected, while sodium excretion tended to increase. In the SIADH group, the decrease in the fractional excretion (FE) of Na+ (FE.Na+) (or FE.Cl-) after urea intake was negatively correlated with urinary urea concentration while the FE.K+ was positively correlated with FE.Na+ (or FE.Cl-), which suggests that the effect of urea on sodium excretion takes place proximally to the distal tubule, probably at the thin ascending limb. After indomethacin intake, FE.Na+ (or FE.Cl-), FE.K+, Fe.osm and Fe.urea decreased in the normal and hyponatremic groups. The mean free water reabsorption relatively to osmolar delivery was lower in SIADH (p < 0.05), and did not change significantly after indomethacin intake. The fact that the decrease of FE.Na+ (or FE.Cl-) after indomethacin was associated with a decrease in FE.K+ suggests that the increase in sodium (or chloride) reabsorption occurred more proximally to the distal tubule (probably a the medullary segment of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle)."
CD009647,0,3942418,0,The importance of plasma colloid osmotic pressure for interstitial fluid volume and fluid balance after elective abdominal vascular surgery.,"The relationships between plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COPp) and interstitial fluid volume (IFV) as well as postoperative fluid balance were investigated in a prospective study involving 53 patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic reconstruction. The patients were divided into four groups according to pre- and postoperative blood replacement and fluid therapy programs whereby a continuum of postoperative COPp-values between 33 and 16 mmHg was obtained. Measurements were done before the operation and on days 1 and 4 after surgery. After surgery, COPp below 20 mmHg led to increased IFV. On day 1, COPp was linearly correlated to the total amount of fluid retained during the day of operation. A positive fluid balance of 3 L on this day ensured unchanged extracellular fluid volume (ECV). Of the 3 L, 1.5 L was insensible water loss and 1.5 L had moved into the cells. On day 4 after surgery, COPp below 22 mmHg was associated with increased plasma volume. The authors suggest that COPp be maintained above 20 mmHg after major surgery, and positive fluid balance should not exceed 5 L during the day of operation."

CD009647,0,7921210,0,Bone resorption in healthy and osteoporotic postmenopausal women: comparison markers for serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen and urinary pyridinium cross-links.,"We compared two highly specific markers for bone resorption-pyridinium cross-links (pyridinoline (PYR) and deoxypyridinoline (DPR)) in urine and carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) in serum-in 63 healthy postmenopausal women and 63 women with osteoporosis characterized by more bone resorption than bone formation. The ICTP, PYR and DPR levels were all higher, by 24% (p = 0.001), 16% (p = 0.05) and 25% (p = 0.004), respectively, in the osteoporotic women. For the merged groups, there were significant correlations between serum ICTP concentration and urinary PYR (r = 0.667, p < 0.0001) and DPR (r = 0.452, p < 0.0001) excretion; for the osteoporotic and normal women separately, the r values were 0.73 (p < 0.01) and 0.45 (p < 0.01) for PYR and 0.51 (p < 0.01) and 0.22 (p = 0.08) for DPR versus ICTP respectively. Weak correlations in linear regression between ICTP and various indices of bone formation (osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen) disappeared when the correlation between ICTP and pyridinolines was accounted for by calculation of partial correlation coefficients in multiple regression analysis. Serum ICTP concentration appears to discriminate between groups of normal and osteoporotic women as well as urinary pyridinium cross-links, which is thus far the most sensitive method for assessing bone resorption."

The volumetric fluid balance, which was measured as the difference between the input and output of irrigating fluid with and without a correction for the blood loss, proved to be an unreliable clinical tool for measuring the absorption. It indicated that fluid absorption occurred only in 40 or 18 of the 62 patients, depending on whether a correction for blood loss was made or not, the volume being only 59% and 71% (median), respectively, of that obtained by the control method. The absorption averaged 1 L in the patients in whom the volumetric measurements did not indicate absorption. The incidence of symptoms of the 'transurethral resection syndrome' increased with the absorbed fluid volume only when measured by the control method."

Prior and shortly after the run, percent body fat, lean body mass, skeletal muscle mass and percent body water were determined non invasively both by the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and the traditional anthropometrical method. In addition, blood and urine samples were collected in order to evaluate fluid homeostasis. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy of the urine was performed in order to detect changes in metabolites of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Body mass increased by 1.9 kg, calculated skeletal muscle mass increased by 0.1 kg, calculated fat mass from anthropometric method decreased by 0.2 kg and from BIA by 3.1 kg. Calculated body water from BIA increased by 1.2 l and plasma volume decreased by 19%. Haematocrit, nitrogen urea, urinary specific gravity decreased whilst sodium increased. (1)H-NMR spectroscopy revealed an increase of ketone bodies after the run. To demonstrate a decrease of skeletal muscle mass after a 100-km-run, we should wait with the measurements of body masses until body water has reached pre race value. The increase of body water is unclear. In future studies, additional methods should be performed to provide information whether skeletal muscle mass decreased after endurance performance and whether metabolites of skeletal muscle mass degradation may impair renal function."

CD009647,0,7276369,0,Insensible fluid losses in severe tetanus.,"Insensible fluid losses were estimated using fluid balances and body weight changes in twelve artificially ventilated patients with severe tetanus. Studies were carried out over initial twenty day periods of treatment on six patients aged between 26 and 49 years and six aged 63 to 78. Nine of the 12 patients lost weight over the study period (the younger losing an average of nearly 10% of their body weight) and all patients had positive fluid balances ranging between 15 and 53 1. The discrepancy between these findings was explained on the basis of considerable and continuing fluid losses in the form of sweat and saliva. When quantified, insensible fluid losses appeared greatest in the younger patients (up to 3.81 per day) and increased throughout the period of study. Dehydration will tend to occur unless the magnitude of these insensible losses is appreciated and taken into account when managing fluids."

After 3 months systolic, diastolic and pulse blood pressure (BP) decreased by 20.2, 13.2, 27.5% (supine) and by 19.4, 11.8, 26.9% (standing), respectively. There were no significant changes of heart rate. Effect of treatment was considered positive in 92.4% of patients. Normalization of blood pressure occurred in 51.8% of patients (in 46.2% and 53.4% among men and women, respectively, p=0.0252; in 55.7% and 48% among patients aged <65 and >65 years, respectively). In patients with type II diabetes rates of positive effect and achievement of target BP <130/85 mm Hg were 60.8% and 31.4%, respectively. Hypokaliemia (3.0-3.5 mmol/l) was registered in 43 patients (3.4%), age of 27 of these patients was 65 years.

We describe a patient with pre-terminal renal failure due to oxalate nephropathy after ileal resection. Increased oral hydration, low oxalate diet, and oral calcium carbonate and potassium citrate supplements resulted in a significant improvement of renal function. During the three-year follow-up, urinary oxalate concentration was repeatedly reduced below the crystallization threshold and serum creatinine decreased from 4.5 to 1.7 mg/dL. This case illustrates the benefit of combining and optimizing dietary and medical management in enteric hyperoxaluria, even in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease."

CD009647,0,1546024,0,Hypertension in elderly patients. The special concerns in this growing population.,"Hypertension is quite common in the elderly population. Isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic hypertension are associated with cardiovascular complications. Like younger patients, the elderly may have labile hypertension. On the other hand, pseudohypertension, auscultatory gap, and postural hypotension are peculiar to the elderly. Obesity, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, baroreceptor insensitivity, decline in renal function, physical inactivity, and insomnia are factors that can lead to or aggravate hypertension in older patients. Secondary hypertension should be suspected if elevated blood pressure first appears late in life or becomes resistant to previously adequate treatment. Spontaneous hypokalemia can indicate primary aldosteronism. Elevation in the serum creatinine level of a patient taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor suggests bilateral renovascular hypertension. The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to prevent morbidity, disability, and death from complications and to maintain quality of life. Psychosocial factors may play an important role in controlling hypertension. Nonpharmacologic treatment, such as weight loss, salt restriction, and exercise, should always be tried prior to and in conjunction with medical therapy. Antihypertensive drugs often cause side effects and should be prescribed with caution. Always start with a low dose and gradually increase it if necessary. All drugs that reduce blood pressure in the younger individual also work in the elderly. ACE inhibitors and calcium blockers are particularly useful because of their low incidence of adverse effects."

In Georgia it began to spread at the end of Autumn 2009. The aim of our study was to define clinical trials of the swine flu (H1N1) in patients of Republic Clinical Hospital in Batumi from 2009 to 2011 and to generalize the methods of treatment. In the hospital there were 94 patients suffering from the swine flu (H1N1) disease, 20 of which due to their critical situation of the disease were treated in the department of the intensive therapy. We studied case histories of 20 patients, who were undergoing treatment in the department of the intensive therapy by the generally acknowledged programme of study and monitoring due to their hard disease. Among these 20 patients 10 were women and 10 men. 10 patients died. The programme of intensive treatment consisted of infusive-transfusive therapy by the negative water balance, antivirus treatment (Tamiflu/Relenza), de-escalation antibiotic therapy, mechanic ventilation of lungs, aerosol therapy, plus symptom treatment. In 2011 there were fewer cases of the swine flu and the death rate compared to the earlier years. In 2011 of 25 patients only one patient died, but in 2009-2010 of 69 patients 7 patients died), which was conditioned by immunity development. The most frequently used regime of lung mechanic ventilation was BIPAR. In the first days antibiotic therapy is not defining. It is necessary to find more effective method of antivirus treatment."

CD009647,0,8721332,0,Echography of the inferior vena cava for estimating fluid removal from patients undergoing hemodialysis.,"Echography was used to perform 118 consecutive measurements of the diameters of the inferior vena cava (IVC) in 28 chronic hemodialysis patients. There was a significant correlation between the percent changes in the IVC in the expiratory phase (dIVC-E) and the percent changes in body weight (dBW) (r = 0.620, p < 0.002, n = 118). The average IVC diameter in the expiratory phase before dialysis (IVC-E) was 15.3 +/- 4.6 mm and this value decreased gradually following ultrafiltration and reached an average diameter of 11.0 +/- 4.3 mm after dialysis. Three cases developed hypotension due to fluid removal. Their IVC-E value showed a rapid reduction below 11.0 mm in the early phase of hemodialysis, then maintained a plateau. The hypotension was attributed to hypovolemia due to excessive dehydration. Our results suggest that the IVC-E diameter in postdialysis would approach 11.0 +/- 4.3 mm, which could be interpreted as being close to the dry weight."

CD009647,0,22786530,0,Electric fans for reducing adverse health impacts in heatwaves.,"Heatwaves are hot weather events, which breach regional or national thresholds, that last for several days. They are likely to occur with increasing frequency in some parts of the world. The potential consequences were illustrated in Europe in August 2003 when there were an estimated 30,000 excess deaths due to a heatwave. Electric fans might be used with the intention of reducing the adverse health effects of a heatwave. Fans do not cool the ambient air but can be used to draw in cooler air from outside when placed at an open window. The aim of the fans would be to increase heat loss by increasing the efficiency of all normal methods of heat loss, but particularly by evaporation and convection methods. However, it should be noted that increased sweating can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if these fluids and electrolytes are not replaced quickly enough. Research has also identified important gaps in knowledge about the use of fans, which might lead to their inappropriate use."

Tear osmolarity testing, the Schirmer filter paper test, and lactoferrin determination by the Lactoplate radial immunodiffusion (RID) method were performed in 20 KCS patients diagnosed on the basis of presenting symptoms and clinical examination. Similar determinations were performed in 20 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects. Mean lactoferrin concentrations in the right eyes of the KCS patients and normal controls were 134 +/- 78 (+/- 1 SD) mg/dL and 118 +/- 56 mg/dL, respectively. Tear osmolarity was 323 +/- 12 mosm/L and 306 +/- 7 mosm/L, in KCS patients and normal controls, respectively. The Schirmer test yielded a mean of 2.4 +/- 1.8 mm/minute of wetting in the KCS patients and 3.0 +/- 1.4 mm/minute in the controls. Used as a diagnostic test, lactoferrin determination by RID was found to have 35% sensitivity and 70% specificity; tear osmolarity determination had 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity; and the Schirmer test yielded 25% sensitivity and 90% specificity."
CD009647,0,10960369,0,Continuous positive airway pressure at 10 cm H(2)O during cardiopulmonary bypass improves postoperative gas exchange.,"Postbypass pulmonary dysfunction including atelectasis and increased shunting is a common problem in the intensive care unit. Negative net fluid balance and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) have been used to reduce the adverse effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the lung. To determine whether CPAP at 10 cm H(2)O during CPB results in improved postoperative gas exchange in comparison with deflated lungs during CPB, we examined 14 patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery. Seven patients received CPAP at 10 cm H(2)O during CPB, and in the other seven patients, the lungs were open to the atmosphere (control). Measurements were taken before and after CPB, after thoracic closure, and 4 h after CPB in the intensive care unit. CPAP at 10 cm H(2)O resulted in significantly more perfusion of lung areas with a normal ventilation/perfusion distribution (V(A)/Q) and significantly less shunt and low V(A)/Q perfusion 4 h after CPB in comparison with the control group. Consequently, arterial oxygen partial pressure was significantly higher and alveolar-arterial oxygen partial pressure difference was significantly smaller. We conclude that CPAP at 10 cm H(2)O during CPB is a simple maneuver that improves postoperative gas exchange."
CD009647,0,8105899,0,The impact of hydration status on the assessment of lean body mass by body electrical impedance in dialysis patients.,"The impact of hydration status on body composition analysis in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients was assessed. Twenty-seven HD patients and 42 PD patients were divided into three groups according to their (postdialytic) hydration status as measured by segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA): normohydrated, dehydrated, or overhydrated. Fifty-six percent of the PD patients and 74% of the HD patients appeared to be normohydrated. Lean body mass (LBM) was calculated in all subjects from skinfold anthropometric (SA) measurements and from whole body BIA data. LBM-SA and LBM-BIA did not differ in normohydrated patients and correlated well with each other (r = 0.88). In overhydrated subjects BIA overestimated LBM compared to SA; in the dehydrated group BIA tended to underestimate LBM. The correlation between LBM-SA and LBM-BIA was poor in both groups. It can be concluded that hydration status has a major influence on BIA-based LBM measurements. Reliable LBM figures can only be obtained when patients are at their ideal dry weight."

A simple, reliable instrument to assess nutritional and hydration status would be very helpful. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has been promising in this context, but data of elderly persons and geriatric in-hospital patients are rare. Therefore, we first compared BIA measurements (resistance, reactance, phase angle and a resulting vectorgraph) with a clinical assessment in 31 community-dwelling women and 30 female nursing-home residents. The results of the BIA measurement correlated well to weight, hand grip strength, and calf circumference. We then compared BIA measurements with clinical judgement of hydration status in 103 acute geriatric hospital in-patients. Concordance between the results of clinical judgement and BIA measurements was only 43.7%. In assessing geriatric in-patients, there is little concordance between the clinical and the bioelectrical evaluation of the hydration status."
CD009647,0,10771700,0,The aging kidney. Defending a delicate balance of fluid and electrolytes.,"The aging kidney is characterized by reduced glomerular filtration rate, loss of tubular volume, and narrowed homeostatic control of water and electrolyte balance. It is unclear whether these physiologic changes represent normal aging or subclinical disease. With aging, there is an increased risk of hyper- or hypovolemia. Sluggish control of potassium concentration also makes hyperkalemia more common, particularly when the patient is using certain drugs. Water metabolism is particularly vulnerable in older patients, resulting in a frequent tendency toward dehydration and hyperosmolality. Understanding these limitations on fluid and electrolyte homeostasis can help the clinician recognize and prevent complications when caring for older patients."

Gastric juices were also tested for pH, protein concentration and specific gravity, urines for protein concentration and osmolarity. Serum and gastric juices were also tested for CEA levels and the results obtained with the two markers compared. In patients with gastric cancer, CA 50 gastric juice levels were statistically higher than in controls; a wide overlap was however present among groups, and sensitivity and specificity were respectively 38% and 85% for serum and 69% and 82% for gastric juice. Sensitivity and specificity were respectively 23% and 89% for CA 50 determination in urines. In this case, no statistically significant difference was observed between gastric cancer and control patients. A trend toward higher median values was observed in advanced with respect to early gastric cancer. A correlation was found between gastric juice and serum CA 50 levels, as well as between serum and urine levels of the marker. A correlation was also observed between CA 50 values and protein concentration in gastric juice and with osmolarity in urines. Overall, CA 50 levels were statistically higher in patients with intestinal metaplasia than in those who did not present the lesion. Increased CA 50 gastric juice levels are also observed in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis and epithelial dysplasia. CA 50 gastric juice and urine levels appear to be dependent, at least in part, on the concentration of the fluid."

Close observation, repeated determinations of electrolytes in plasma, urine and entries, together with measurements of water input and output, will allow the tonicity balance of the patient to be understood and thus occasional tragedies such as observed in cases 4 and 5 to be prevented."
CD009647,0,9321788,0,Assessment of protein permeability in normal human systemic circulation.,"Vascular permeability to oncotic agents is an important determinant of transvascular fluid flux (J) and systemic fluid balance. In this study, a technique was developed to measure protein reflection coefficients (omega) for albumin (Alb), immunoglobulin (Ig) G, and IgM in the intact human systemic circulation to evaluate the role of vascular protein permeability in health and disease. A mathematical model was developed to calculate omega in the forearm circulation from changes in venous hematocrit and protein concentration that occur during edema formation. Assumptions required for the model were validated in an initial set of experiments in normal subjects when edema was induced by inflating a pneumatic cuff on the upper arm. A second series of experiments assessed omega for Alb, IgG, and IgM in men (n = 7) and in women in the follicular (n = 5) and luteal (n = 4) phases of the menstrual cycle. There was an increasing trend in omega with molecular size in aggregated subjects [omega Alb = 0.81 +/- 0.12 (SE), omega IgG = 0.88 +/- 0.12, omega IgM = 0.92 +/- 0.18; P = 0.088]. These values were consistent with those obtained with in vitro preparations. omega values were lower in women in the luteal than in the follicular phase (P = 0.047). We conclude that the assumptions required for this model can be achieved in the intact forearm circulation and that there are menstrual phase-related differences in vascular protein permeability in normal women."

The most significant predisposing factors have been identified as existing carotid arterial disease or prior stroke, heavy calcification of the aorta, renal dysfunction, advanced age, and diabetes mellitus. We have studied a series of 600 open heart patients from 1992 to 1995 from the incidence of peri-operative stroke and mortality, evaluating 16 risk factors: heavy calcification of the ascending aorta, asymptomatic carotid disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, prior CVA, left ventricular function (ejection fraction of 20% or less), age greater than 70, renal dysfunction, transmural myocardial infarction, fluid balance index greater than 2500 ccs, smoking, type of procedure, emergency procedure, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, cardiopulmonary bypass time, gender, and hypertension Stroke occurred in 8 patients (1.3%), one of whom die postoperatively. Full or near-full recovery was experienced by 5 patients; 2 patients remained partially dysfunctional at the end of the study period. The operative mortality was 2.0% (12 patients); 10 deaths occurred in hospital and 2 following discharge within 30 days postoperatively. The risk of stroke was 15 times greater in patients over age 70; 16 times greater in older males (> or = 70 years); 5 times greater in patients with prior stroke or existing (asymptomatic) carotid artery disease; 8 times greater in patients with renal dysfunction; 4 times greater with a positive fluid balance index; and twice greater when cardiopulmonary bypass exceeded 110 minutes. Four of the stroke patients had diabetes mellitus. Two of 9 patients with heavy calcification of the aortic arch suffered cerebrovascular injury. Six or more of the risk factors studied were present in 81 patients; all 8 stroke patients (9.9%) came from this subgroup. The study suggests the importance of pre-operative evaluation of cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease and the minimal manipulation (""minimal touch"" technique) of a calcific aortic arch."

CD009647,0,11536254,0,Low prevalence of TT virus in the cerebrospinal fluid of viremic patients with central nervous system disorders.,"TT virus (TTV) is a widespread infectious agent of humans identified in 1998. In infected individuals, TTV induces persistent viremia but its life cycle and pathogenic potential are still poorly understood. In the present study, the presence of TTV DNA in 32 consecutive paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with neurological (mainly multiple sclerosis) disorders was investigated by means of a sensitive quantitative real-time PCR assay. Of the 24 patients who were found to carry TTV DNA in serum, 3 also had detectable TTV DNA in their CSF. Two TTV positive CSF samples had markers indicative of blood contamination or a disrupted blood-brain barrier and contained considerably lower TTV loads as compared with the corresponding serum samples, thus suggesting that the virus they contained was of plasma origin. These findings indicated that in general TTV does not permeate effectively an intact blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, the CNS does not represent a common site of TTV replication and persistence. However, at least one exception was observed: the third TTV positive CSF sample (obtained from a patient with subacute dementia of unknown origin) showed no markers suggestive of disrupted blood-brain barrier or blood contamination and had a TTV DNA concentration similar to that found in the patient's serum. In addition, the TTV isolates detected in the two body fluids were distinct genetically. The detection of TTV DNA in CSF is of considerable interest but the clinical significance remains unknown."

The irrigating fluid used in all resections was tenfold diluted Urigal solution containing 1% ethanol. Expired breath was collected into a rubber bag every 10 min during the surgery, and the concentration of ethanol was analyzed using a gas detector tube (GASTEC LTD.). Hemodynamic parameters including central venous pressure were routinely measured at the same intervals. The volumetric fluid balance was measured every 20 min. Blood was collected preoperatively, at the same 20-min intervals during the resection, and 4-6 hours after the end of the operation. Serum electrolytes, hemoglobin and total plasma protein concentration were measured, and blood gas tension was analyzed. Mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, blood gas tension showed no significant changes at these observed time intervals. Heart rate decreased 120 min after the start of the operation. Ethanol was detected in the expired breath 10 min after the start of the surgery, and showed progressive increase in concentration until the end of the surgery. Serum electrolyte concentrations and hemoglobin content showed gradual decrease proportional to the increase in irrigating fluid volume. The ethanol concentration in the expired breath was significantly correlated with the change in serum sodium concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,17895487,0,Abdominal compartment syndrome is common in medical intensive care unit patients receiving large-volume resuscitation.,"Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) have been well described in surgical patients. Large-volume resuscitation is thought to be a risk factor for IAH/ACS in this group. However, little is known of the incidence of IAH/ACS in critically ill medical patients. The authors aim to ascertain the incidence of ACS in critically ill medical patients receiving large-volume resuscitation. Over an 8-month study period, the authors performed a prospective cohort study of medical intensive care unit (ICU) patients with a minimum net positive fluid balance of 5 L within the preceding 24 hours. The primary outcome of interest is the development of ACS, defined as an intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) > or = 20 mm Hg associated with new organ dysfunction. IAP was measured by transducing bladder pressure and was recorded along with fluid balance at enrollment and every 12 hours thereafter up to 96 hours. The setting is a medical ICU at a major university hospital. Of the 468 medical ICU admissions screened, 40 (8.5%) were identified who met the 24-hour fluid balance inclusion criterion. Upon enrollment, this cohort had a mean Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 23 and a median positive fluid balance of 6.9 L. Thirty-four of the 40 study patients (85%) had intra-abdominal hypertension (IAP > or = 12 mm Hg). During the study period, 13 of the 40 (33%) patients developed IAP > or = 20 mm Hg and 10 (25%) met the criteria for ACS. None underwent laparotomy. ACS is frequently found in critically ill medical patients receiving large-volume resuscitation. The clinical significance of this finding remains unclear. However, routine monitoring of IAP should be considered in medical patients with a 5-L net positive fluid balance in 24 hours. Future studies are warranted to evaluate clinical outcomes of medical patients with ACS and risk factors for its development."
CD009647,0,10540019,0,A retrospective study of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in ALS patients during the BDNF and CNTF trials.,"Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) provides a reliable route for nutrition and hydration in ALS patients with dysphagia. We performed a retrospective analysis of the CNTF and BDNF databases to determine the clinical status of ALS patients within 30 days preceding PEG insertion. This analysis revealed an approximately 50% reduction of function across multiple measures of ALS disease status. A trend to earlier intervention with PEG was apparent upon review of published studies and the CNTF and BDNF studies. By comparing the rate of decline pre- and post-PEG, nutritional supplementation via PEG stabilized the weight loss experienced by patients. Death within 30 days post-PEG was associated with a marked reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) and identified a group of ALS patients in whom PEG should be cautiously performed. These data emphasize the importance of sequential measurement of FVC in managing ALS patients to guide the timing of nutritional intervention with PEG."

CD009647,0,9402093,0,Total body water and body composition in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients.,"In this investigation, total body water (TBW) in ten chronic peritoneal dialysis patients was studied by deuterium (TBW-2H), skinfold thickness (TBW-ST), Watson formula (TBW-WA), 58% of body weight (TBW-58%), and bioelectrical impedance (TBW-BIA), and these results were compared with the reference oxygen18 (TBW-18O) method. We also analyzed the fat-free mass (FFM) by skinfold thickness (FFM-ST), bioelectrical impedance (FFM-BIA), oxygen18 (FFM-18O), and creatinine kinetics method (FFM-CK). In addition, resting metabolic rate was measured by indirect calorimetry. Compared with TBW-18O, TBW-58% and TBW-BIA were significantly different (P < 0.01). TBW-2H overestimated TBW-18O by 4.3%. TBW-ST and TBW-WA gave slightly greater values than TBW-18O, although these values were nonstatistically significant. The best prediction of total body water from these methods was obtained with the Watson formula. When Kt/V was calculated from these results, the values obtained were statistically greater (BIA, P < 0.001) and smaller (58% BW, P < 0.01) than those obtained with either 18O or Watson formula. The fat-free mass estimation also led to discrepant findings. Indeed, FFM-CK was significantly lower (P < 0.05) as compared with FFM-ST, FFM-BIA, or FFM-18O. Resting metabolic rate was strongly correlated with FFM estimated by skinfold thickness (r = 0.91, P < 0.001), bioelectrical impedance (r = 0.85, P < 0.005), and 18O (r = 0.77, P < 0.01), but not when fat-free mass was estimated by the creatinine kinetic method. The water content of fat-free mass estimated by skinfold thickness was found to be 69.7 +/- 6.9% in these patients, a value lower than the standard 73.2% found in healthy adults. This study confirms that there is an abnormal water distribution in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients. However, when compared with the oxygen18 reference method, the Watson formula allows a reliable estimation of Kt/V."

A clinical diagnosis and etiology of HF can often be established during history and physical examination. Fluid volume status must be assessed by estimating jugular venous pressure in centimeters of water by identifying the top of the jugular venous pulsation in the neck and estimating its vertical height from the right atrium. Left ventricular ejection fraction must be obtained to classify patients into systolic and diastolic HF and to guide evidence-based therapy."
CD009647,0,9578671,0,[Estimation of total body water from routine urea kinetics].,"The comparison of total body water obtained by Watson formula with results of bioelectrical impedance (BIA) shows a fair approximation (Delta% = 1.0 +/- 8.45). However, when compared to other literature formulas the BIA values are higher (8 divided by 23%), and this discrepancy needs further analysis. Urea kinetics was computed using as input data for distribution volume both the Watson anthropometrical and the BIA TBW values: the clearance results do not differ significantly (Delta% = 0.74 +/- 8.35). The Kt/V index results are nearly identical (Delta% = 0.12 +/- 1.17), due to a mathematical loop: a wrong input of volume induces a comparable error of the clearance result, while their ratio is unchanged. For practical routine to monitoring dialysis adequacy the Watson anthropometrical formula has proven as a satisfactory simple approach. Periodical BIA determination provides useful informations mainly when the anthropometrical estimation are doubtful and the comparison of data may increase the kinetic reliability."

An average of 118 (range 100-208) of the most atypical, visually selected Feulgen-stained cells in peritoneal fluid obtained from 46 patients undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery for histologically proven ovarian tumors of low malignant potential and truly invasive ovarian cancer were evaluated retrospectively using the SAMBA-4000 Image analysis system. The patients were stratified into 3 groups: 16 with ovarian tumors of low malignant potential (LMP), 14 with low-stage disease (LSD) (FIGO I and II), and 16 with advanced-stage (ASD) (FIGO III and IV). A pattern of high-degree aneuploidy with negative balance (means: LMP, 3.3; LSD, 20.5; ASD, 32.0), increased proliferative index (LMP, 11.2; LSD, 16.1; ASD, 13.9), and percentage of cells with DNA content greater than 5C (LMP, 6.7; LSD, 6.5; ASD, 9.5) was demonstrated in the peritoneal fluid of 8 of 16 patients with LMP (50%), 8 of 14 patients with LSD (57%), and 13 of 16 with ASD (81%). The median disease-free interval for patients with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer with peritoneal DNA diploid tumor cells was 57 months and for those with DNA aneuploid tumor cells 28 months, while in patients with LMP it was 65 and 54 months, respectively. In total, 19 patients developed a recurrence (LMP, 2; LSD, 5; ASD, 12) of which 17 were shown to have DNA aneuploid cells in the peritoneal fluid. Multivariate analysis, however, did not identify aneuploid population in the fluid, ploidy balance, proliferation indices, or degree of hyperploidy as an independently significant variable for predicting recurrence. It did appear, however, that tumor cells in peritoneal fluid with a degree of hyperploidy greater than 8 had a strong correlation for development of recurrence, although not statistically significant. Interactive image analysis of tumor cells in peritoneal fluid proved to be a valuable adjunct to cytodiagnosis. Seven of 28 patients (25%) who were underdiagnosed by cytology alone (LMP, 2; LSD, 3; ASD, 2) were shown to have malignant cells in their peritoneal fluid, while 2 of 18 patients (11%) who were called positive by cytology (LMP, 1; LSD, 1) showed diploid pattern histograms and upon review were interpreted as reactive mesothelial cells."
CD009647,0,17006123,0,An audit of fluid and heparin administration during interventional neuroradiologic procedures.,"Vascular lesions of the brain such as aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations are increasingly being treated by radiologists. They use heparinized saline in pressurized bags to flush the catheter systems continuously. This fluid could have detrimental effects if the volume infused is high. Therefore, we measured the amount of heparinized saline used by radiologists and tried to assess its significance. Data were collected from the first 50 patients who underwent interventional treatment during September to December 2004. Fluid and heparin, administered by both the radiologists and anesthesiologists, were recorded in addition to demographics and postoperative complications. The mean age of patients was 49+/-14 years. The average volume of fluid given by the radiologists was 980+/-480 mL. The anesthesiologists administered an average of 1500 mL crystalloids and 650 mL of colloids. The overall fluid balance at the end of procedure was positive by 2122+/-947 mL. The amount of heparin administered by flush solution was a mean of 2500+/-1200 IU. The total amount of fluid administered had no relation to the development of vasospasm or infection. However, a statistically nonsignificant (P=0.15) 30% increase in total fluid administered to patients, who required postoperative mechanical ventilation, suggests that the relationship between fluid administration and postoperative mechanical ventilation should be investigated further in patients who undergo interventional neuroendovasular procedures. In conclusion, radiologists administer significant amount of fluid and heparin during interventional procedures. Routine recording and monitoring of all fluid and heparin administered is advisable in interventional neuroendovasular procedures. The relationship between fluid administration and postoperative mechanical ventilation should be investigated further in patients who undergo interventional neuroendovasular procedures."
CD009647,0,1637210,0,Prolonged open sternotomy and delayed sternal closure after cardiac operations.,"Maintenance of an open sternotomy (OS) after a complicated cardiac operation is an adjunct in the treatment of the severely impaired heart. We hypothesized that predictors of the timing, morbidity, and prognosis of delayed sternal closure (DSC) could be determined by intensive case review. Prolonged OS was used in 107 of 6,030 adult open heart patients (1.8%) between 1987 and 1991. Indications for OS were hemodynamic instability (40), myocardial edema (18), intractable bleeding (23), relentless arrhythmias (9), and ventricular assist devices (17). Delayed sternal closure was carried out in 75 of 107 patients at a mean of 3.4 +/- 0.3 days after OS. Fifty of these 75 (67%) survived and were discharged an average of 43 +/- 6 days after closure. Fifty-seven patients died: 32 before DSC at 3.7 +/- 0.8 days after OS and 25 after DSC at 27 +/- 4 days after OS. Baseline cardiac index (1.7 +/- 0.1 L.min-1.m-2) improved an average of 1.0 +/- 0.1 L.min-1.m-2 after OS (p less than or equal to 0.001) and remained stable through DSC (2.5 +/- 0.3 L.min-1.m-2) and late (9 +/- 0.7 days) follow-up (2.8 +/- 0.1 L.min-1.m-2). Delayed sternal closure in patients without ventricular assist devices was significantly more likely to be successful (45/63 versus 9/27; p less than 0.002) when carried out after the onset of a negative daily fluid balance. Sternal infection occurred in 4 of 75 (5%) patients after DSC and was associated with bleeding as an indication for OS (3/15 versus 1/60; p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009647,0,1093756,0,Effect of salt depletion and propranolol on blood pressure and plasma renin activity in various forms of hypertension.,"The effect of propranolol therapy on the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and plasma renin activity (PRA) was studied in three groups of hypertensive patients who were also treated with saliuretics. Group A: In 14 patients with essential hypertension on chlorthalidone treatment, an additional daily dose of 640 mg propranolol for two months led to a significant reduction of the MAP (from 124 to 105 mm Hg) and PRA (from 5.3 to 2.0 ng AI/ml/hr standing). There was no correlation between MAP reduction and either the original levels or change in PRA. Group B: In 14 patients with essential hypertension and 5 with renal artery stenosis studied on a fixed salt intake, the plasma and extracellular volumes, PRA, and blood pressures were recorded before and after three days of diuretic induced salt depletion and, with maintenance of the depleted state, after three days of propranolol. Salt depletion resulted in a decrease in MAP from 132 to 128 mm Hg (NS), and PRA increased from 3.4 to 22.3 ng AI/ml/hr (P less than 0.01). There was no correlation between change in MAP and PRA control values, PRA change, or any of the volume parameters. Addition of propranolol was followed by a rapid MAP decrease to 111 mm Hg (P less than 0.01), and the PRA dropped to a mean of 8.5 (P less than 0.01). No correlation was found between change in MAP and change in PRA. The patients with renal artery stenosis did not differ in their reactions from those with essential hypertension. Group C: In five patients with moderate renal failure and normal to expanded 82-Br distribution volume, propranolol lowered MAP by 10% and lowered the PRA in all five. Salt depletion by furosemide to 82-Br volumes below normal resulted in a 10% decrease of MAP and a marked rise in PRA. In this state propranolol was followed by a further MAP reduction of 18% and a decrease in PRA. There was no quantitative relationship between MAP and PRA change during either of the treatment regimes. It is concluded that in various forms of hypertension, the blood pressure can be effectively lowered by combining diuretics and propranolol regardless of the pretreatment PRA level."

Heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index by thermodilution and cutaneous blood flow by laser-Doppler technique were measured. In 9 patients with no significant hemodynamic and cutaneous blood flow response to the AVP antagonist, baseline values (mean +/- standard deviation) were: heart rate, 77 +/- 14 beats/min; systemic arterial pressure, 120/79 +/- 18/8 mm Hg; pulmonary arterial pressure, 42/21 +/- 12/8 mm Hg; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 19 +/- 7 mm Hg; cardiac index, 2.2 +/- 0.6 liters/min/m2; plasma AVP, 2.3 +/- 0.8 pg/ml; and plasma osmolality, 284 +/- 14 mosm/kg H2O. The tenth patient had the most severe CHF. His plasma AVP level was 55 pg/ml and plasma osmolality was 290 mosm/kg. He responded to the AVP antagonist with a decrease in systemic arterial pressure from 115/61 to 79/41 mm Hg, in pulmonary arterial pressure from 58/31 to 33/13 mm Hg and in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure from 28 to 15 mm Hg. Simultaneously, cardiac index increased from 1.1 to 2.2 liters/min/m2 and heart rate from 113 to 120 beats/min; cutaneous blood flow increased 5-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,8126041,0,Upper-airway obstruction and perioperative management of the airway in patients managed with posterior operations on the cervical spine for rheumatoid arthritis.,"We reviewed the records of 128 patients who had a total of 128 consecutive posterior operations on the cervical spine for problems related to rheumatoid arthritis. Our purpose was to examine perioperative complications related to the airway. The patients were divided into two groups for analysis on the basis of the technique of intubation that had been used. An upper-airway obstruction developed after extubation in eight (14 per cent) of the fifty-eight patients who had been intubated without fiberoptic assistance compared with one (1 per cent) of the seventy patients who had been intubated fiberoptically (p = 0.02). The two groups had similar characteristics with regard to age, sex, severity of the myelopathy, American Rheumatology Association classification, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, cigarette use, duration of the arthritis, use of preoperative traction, use of steroids (both preoperatively and intraoperatively), size of the endotracheal tube, duration of the operation, total duration of the anesthesia, intraoperative fluid balance, and type of immediate immobilization of the neck. The only significant difference between the groups was the time to extubation, which averaged 17.9 hours in the fiberoptic group and 10.6 hours in the non-fiberoptic group (p = 0.02). Logistic regression analysis showed that non-fiberoptic intubation was the significant risk factor, even when allowance was made for the difference in the lengths of time to extubation. We concluded that this life-threatening complication can be minimized with fiberoptic management of the airway."
CD009647,0,19858078,0,"Cerebrospinal hypocretin, daytime sleepiness and sleep architecture in Parkinson's disease dementia.","Excessive daytime sleepiness is common in Parkinson's disease and has been associated with Parkinson's disease-related dementia. Narcoleptic features have been observed in Parkinson's disease patients with excessive daytime sleepiness and hypocretin cell loss has been found in the hypothalamus of Parkinson's disease patients, in association with advanced disease. However, studies on cerebrospinal fluid levels of hypocretin-1 (orexin A) in Parkinson's disease have been inconclusive. Reports of sleep studies in Parkinson's disease patients with and without excessive daytime sleepiness have also been disparate, pointing towards a variety of causes underlying excessive daytime sleepiness. In this study, we aimed to measure cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels in Parkinson's disease patients with and without dementia and to study their relationship to dementia and clinical excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as to describe potentially related sleep architecture changes. Twenty-one Parkinson's disease patients without dementia and 20 Parkinson's disease patients with dementia, along with 22 control subjects without sleep complaints, were included. Both Epworth sleepiness scale, obtained with the help of the caregivers, and mini-mental state examination were recorded. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels were measured in all individuals using a radio-immunoassay technique. Additionally, eight Parkinson's disease patients without dementia and seven Parkinson's disease patients with dementia underwent video-polysomnogram and multiple sleep latencies test. Epworth sleepiness scale scores were higher in Parkinson's disease patients without dementia and Parkinson's disease patients with dementia than controls (P < 0.01) and scores >10 were more frequent in Parkinson's disease patients with dementia than in Parkinson's disease patients without dementia (P = 0.04). Cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels were similar among groups (controls = 321.15 +/- 47.15 pg/ml; without dementia = 300.99 +/- 58.68 pg/ml; with dementia = 309.94 +/- 65.95 pg/ml; P = 0.67), and unrelated to either epworth sleepiness scale or mini-mental state examination. Dominant occipital frequency awake was slower in Parkinson's disease patients with dementia than Parkinson's disease patients without dementia (P = 0.05). Presence of slow dominant occipital frequency and/or loss of normal non-rapid eye movement sleep architecture was more frequent among Parkinson's disease patients with dementia (P = 0.029). Thus, excessive daytime sleepiness is more frequent in Parkinson's disease patients with dementia than Parkinson's disease patients without dementia, but lumbar cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels are normal and unrelated to severity of sleepiness or the cognitive status. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid does not accurately reflect the hypocretin cell loss known to occur in the hypothalamus of advanced Parkinson's disease. Alternatively, mechanisms other than hypocretin cells dysfunction may be responsible for excessive daytime sleepiness and the sleep architecture alterations seen in these patients."
CD009647,0,12809171,0,Elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus are moderately influenced by glycemic control.,"The aim of this study was to establish whether glycemic control results in decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) in Type 2 diabetic subjects. Newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetic subjects were recruited and followed-up by 6-month intensive medical management. All the participants were carefully interviewed, clinically examined, and laboratory tested to exclude conditions likely to provoke an inflammatory response, which was an exclusion criterium. CRP was measured by automated microparticle enzyme immunoassay (IMx, Abbott Laboratories, USA). Two-hundred and forty-eight patients were included in the analysis of data. At baseline, average CRP levels were of 9.6 +/- 6.2 mg/l. Only 14 (5.7%) patients showed a fasting glucose equal or lower than 6.1 mmo/l (5.6 +/- 0.4 mmo/l); of them, 6 (42.8%) had elevated CRP levels (8.8 +/- 6.7 mg/l). The fasting glucose in the 234 (94.3%) non-controlled subjects was 13.1 +/- 4.8 mmol/l; of them 179 (76.5%) subjects showed elevated CRP levels (10.9 +/- 6.5 mg/I). At the end of the 6-month follow-up, the average fasting glucose and HbA1c in the overall group decreased from 12.5 +/- 5.0 to 9.0 +/- 1.6 mmol/l, p < 0.00001, and 13.0 +/- 4.9 to 8.9 +/- 2.9%, p < 0.00001, which resulted in a significant reduction of CRP levels (9.6 +/- 6.2 to 6.3 +/- 3.0 mg/l, p < 0.00001). Seventy-one (28.6%) patients reached glycemic control; however, only 29 (40.8%) of them reduced the CRP levels to 3 mg/l or less (1.3 +/- 1.9 mg/l), and the remaining 42 controlled patients maintained high CRP concentration (4.2 +/- 1.2 mg/I), p < 0.00001.

CD009647,0,2671477,0,[Effect of captopril therapy on sodium and water excretion in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites].,"Ascites in patients with cirrhosis of the liver frequently is refractory to diuretic treatment. It was postulated that vasoconstriction of the renal cortex, mediated by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS), may be one course of the disturbed sodium- and water-excretion in these patients. We therefore investigated in 14 cirrhotic patients with ascites under constant diuretic treatment the effects of low-dose captopril therapy on urinary sodium- and potassium-excretion, body weight, abdominal girth, serum-sodium, -potassium, creatinine-clearance, plasma-renin-activity (PRA), plasma-aldosterone (PA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). After a control period of 4 days the patients received 2 x 6.25 mg/d captopril for 5 days and 4 x 6.25 mg/d for further 5 days. Treatment was followed by a second control period without captopril. PRA increased significantly after 2 days of captopril treatment. 2 x 6.25 mg/d captopril induced a significant increase in sodium excretion and a significant decrease of body weight. MAP decreased slightly but significantly without clinical signs of hypotension. 4 x 6.25 mg/d captopril resulted in a further reduction of body weight and a further enhancement of sodium excretion. Three days after withdrawal of captopril sodium output was significantly reduced again."
CD009647,0,451887,0,Protein malnutrition following intestinal bypass for morbid obesity.,"Intestinal bypass surgery, performed for weight reduction in the morbidly obese patient, is frequently complicated by the development and hepatic complications. In 44 morbidly obese individuals, 55 inches of proximal jejunum were anastomosed, end to side, to 5 inches of distal ileum. All the patients were followed with body composition measurements, performed by multiple isotope dilution, prior to and at regular time intervals following bypass surgery. In 33 patients a decrease in body fat accounted for the entire postbypass weight loss, while the lean body mass remained normal in both size and composition. In these patients, at 1 year, body weights had decreased by 24.4 +/- 2.1%, while the body cell masses had decreased by 2.1 +/- 7.1%. In the remaining 11 patients, the postbypass weight loss resulted from a loss of both body fat and body cell mass. Their body weights at 1 year had decreased by 27.0 +/- 3.0%, while the body fat and body cell mass. Their body weights at 1 year had decreased by 27.0 +/- 3.0%, while the body cell masses decreased by 22.0 +/- 6.1%. Furthermore, their body compositions were characteristic of protein malnutrition with a contracted body cell mass and an expanded extracellular mass. Six of these 11 patients have required admission to hospital on 10 occasions because of malaise, anorexia, debilitating weakness, hypokalemia, and abnormal liver function. They were treated for 14.5 +/- 1.9 days with an intravenous infusion of amino acids without additional nonprotein calories. The body composition, initially characteristic of malnutrition, became normal. Their symptoms disappeared and hepatic function returned to normal. Subsequently a high-protein diet was required to prevent a recurrence of symptoms and to maintain a normal body composition. The data indicate that protein malnutrition developed in 11 of 44 patients undergoing jejunoileal bypass for weight reduction."

CD009647,0,10927682,0,Effects of silicone gel sheet on the stratum corneum hydration.,"Various groups have reported the efficacy of treatment with topical silicone gel sheet (SGS) for keloids and hypertrophic scars. Because its hydrating effect on the stratum corneum (SC) has been suggested as a mechanism underlying its therapeutic effectiveness, we evaluated it by comparing it with simple plastic film occlusion. With biophysical instruments we assessed the water content of the skin surface as well as its water evaporation on the flexor aspects of bilateral forearms of 10 healthy volunteers for 30min after removal of dressings of SGS or a plastic film that were applied either for 1 day or for 7 days. Occlusion with SGS or plastic film induced hydration of the skin surface, which was followed by an initial quick and later slow process of dehydration when the skin was exposed to the ambient atmosphere. The magnitude of the increase in hydration induced by SGS was always smaller than that of the plastic film occlusion and, unlike the latter treatment, hydration became less with repetition of SGS treatment. On day 7, the SC hydration quickly reduced to the level of non-treated control skin after removal of the dressings. An in vivo test demonstrated that the water-holding capacity of the SC normalised after 7 days of SGS treatment. SGS probably produces a favourable condition for the skin by protecting it from various environmental stimuli, while keeping the SC in an adequately but not over-hydrated condition."

The aim of this study was to investigate variables associated with blood pressure; with a particular emphasis on the differences in insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the body composition and the recognized risk factors for atherosclerosis among elderly males and females. A total of 374 participants (174 males and 200 females) aged from 60 to 90 years were recruited from different parts of Slovakia. The elderly were not bed-ridden, nor mentally impaired, they were able to manage their daily activities by themselves. The ACE I/D polymorphism was determined by PCR amplification of the ACE gene sequence. Body composition variables were obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis, using the BIA 101 soft tissue-body impedance analyzer (Akern, S.r.l.). The subjects were determined to be hypertensive (blood pressure > or = 140/90 mm Hg) or normotensive (blood pressure < or = 140/90 mm Hg ). These two subgroups of males and females did not differ significantly in their mean ages. As expected, the hypertensive subjects of both sexes showed significantly higher mean values in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), in body mass index (BMI), and in the mean values of their plasma glucose and extracellular water (ECW). The genotype distribution and allele frequencies in the whole sample (D = 0.5474, I = 0.4526) fell within the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of the deleterious D allele in the normotensive (0.5532) and hypertensive (0.5516) subjects was not significantly different. The ACE I/D genotypes did not associate either with the systolic (p = 0.836) or diastolic BP (p = 0.629). From the other variables that may induce differences in blood pressure, a statistical effect was detected for glucose, Na/K, and Apo A1/ApoB ratios and physical activity on SBP, and for ApoA1, physical activity, BMI and total cholesterol on DBP."

CD009647,0,7374199,0,Sequential pathophysiological changes characterizing the progression from renal dysfunction to acute renal failure following cardiac operation.,"Sequential pathophysiological data were analyzed from 14 patients who exhibited similar severe depression of cardiac and renal function within 24 hours of cardiac operation. Seven patients exhibited postoperative renal dysfunction (defined by a minimum postoperative clearance of inulin [Cin] between 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 and one-half normal) and seven progressed from renal dysfunction to acute renal failure (ARF) (Cin less than or equal to ml/min/1.73 m2). In ARF patients depression of cardiac function was profound and persistent from postoperative days 1 to 7. Urine flow remained greater than 1 ml/min, and serum creatinine rose progressively. The Cin declined progressively during the first postoperative week. The ratio or urinary to plasma osmolality fell, and the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and potassium (FEK) increased substantially. By contrast, in renal dysfunction patients definite hemodynamic improvement occurred and renal function remained stable. Increased FENa in renal dysfunction was associated with hemodynamic improvement, weight loss, and stable fractional potassium excretion. These data provide unique documentation of the indices of hemodynamic and renal function associated with the progression to postoperative ARF. The central role of sustained profound depression of cardiac function in this progression appears to be the primary factor in the lethality of postoperative ARF."
CD009647,0,11641333,0,Pulmonary and bronchial circulations: contributions to heat and water exchange in isolated lungs.,"The relative contribution of the pulmonary and bronchial circulatory systems to heat and water exchange in normal lungs was evaluated in 20 isolated, in situ perfused dog lungs and in four patients undergoing elective cardiopulmonary bypass. In isolated dog lungs, if the pulmonary artery was perfused at a nominal flow rate (0.5 l/min), bronchial artery perfusion (up to 70 ml/min) did not significantly affect the expired gas temperature. When the lungs were not perfused through either system, 8 min of ventilation with cool, dry gas decreased the temperature of the expired gas by 6.2 +/- 1.4 degrees C. Selective perfusion of bronchial arteries at 68 +/- 10 mmHg resulted in a mean flow rate of 28 +/- 16 ml/min and increased the average temperature of the expired gas by 0.6 degrees C. An increase in the rate of bronchial arterial perfusion to 55 +/- 14 ml/min increased the average temperature of the expired gas by 1.3 degrees C. The time constant for equilibration of tritiated water between the perfusate and the lung parenchyma was 130 +/- 33 min for pulmonary arterial perfusion and 35 +/- 13 min for combined bronchial and pulmonary perfusion, which indicated that filtration of water from high-pressure bronchial vessels facilitated water exchange in the lung interstitium. The rate of tracer equilibration was similar between the perfusate and gas in both variants of perfusion, but the ratios of tracer gas to perfusate were different (0.42 +/- 0.06 for pulmonary, 0.98 +/- 0.07 for combined), which indicates that bronchial vessels contribute mainly to the hydration of the bronchial mucosa. In humans, the bronchial blood flow was capable of maintaining heat supply after the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Before bypass, when both pulmonary and bronchial blood flow were present, the mean time constant of the temperature decay after a switch to ventilation with cool, dry gas was 35 +/- 12 s. The average temperature difference between the blood and expired gas was 2.4 +/- 0.50 degrees C. After 5 min of dry gas ventilation, the temperature difference between the expired gas and initial blood temperature decreased an average of 3.8 +/- 0.06 degrees C (P < 0.05). The time constant of temperature decay increased to 56 +/- 14 s (P < 0.05). We conclude that bronchial perfusion has a less important role in the temperature balance of the respiratory tract compared with pulmonary arterial perfusion because heat flux is ""flow limited"" but is important in providing water for hydration of the mucosal surface and interstitial compartments of peribronchial tissues."

CD009647,0,20512356,0,Effects of aging on thermoregulatory responses and hormonal changes in humans during the four seasons in Japan.,"Physiological functions are impaired in various organs in aged people, as manifest by, e.g., renal and cardiac dysfunction and muscle atrophy. The elderly are also at increased risk of both hypothermia and hyperthermia in extreme temperatures. The majority of those over 65 years old have elevated serum osmolality. Our hypothesis is that the elderly have suppressed osmolality control in different seasons compared to the young. Eight healthy young men and six healthy older men participated in this study. The experiments were performed during spring, summer, autumn and winter in Japan, with average atmospheric temperatures of 15-20°C in spring, 25-30°C in summer, 15-23°C in autumn and 5-10°C in winter. Each subject immersed his lower legs in warm water at 40°C for 30 min. Core (tympanic) temperature and sweat rate at chest were recorded continuously. Blood was taken pre-immersion to measure the concentrations of antidiuretic hormone, serum osmolality, plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, aldosterone, leptin, thyroid stimulating hormone, fT(3) and fT(4). The results suggested that the elderly have suppressed osmolality control compared to the young; osmolality was especially elevated in winter compared to the summer in elderly subjects. Therefore, particularly in the elderly, balancing fluid by drinking water should be encouraged to maintain euhydration status in winter."
CD009647,0,3304301,0,[Dihydroergotamine in the treatment of patients with symptomatic hypotension during regular hemodialysis].,"The efficacy and safety of dihydroergotamine (DHE, Ditamin) in the treatment of symptomatic hypotension in regularly dialysed patients were tested in comparison to placebo in a single-blind, randomised clinical trial. Ten adult uremic patients (5 men and 5 women) with acute hypotension during hemodialysis, at least once weekly associated with symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, were included into the study. The administration of DHE during hemodialysis in a dose of 10 micrograms/kg body weight intravenously resulted in an increase in blood pressure (BP) from 91 +/- 13 to 114 +/- 14 and from 60 +/- 12 to 78 +/- 11 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively (p less than 0.01). The maximum effect on BP (systolic and diastolic) was achieved 15 to 30 min after DHE administration; thereafter a gradual decline of effect on BP was observed, the t1/2 of disappearance of effect being 46 min. The use of isotonic or hypertonic saline solution in the treatment of hypotension decreased under the administration of DHE from 1200 +/- 600 ml to 70 ml and from 34 +/- 28 to 10 +/- 17 ml per patient and dialysis, respectively (p less than 0.01). In spite of a higher ultrafiltration rate resulting in a greater body weight reduction after hemodialysis, the incidence of symptomatic hypotension decreased after DHE administration from 1.46 +/- 0.52 to 0.14 episodes per patient and dialysis (p less than 0.01). It may be concluded that the resistance of uremic patients to hypovolemic stress occurring during hemodialysis is markedly increased after intravenous administration of DHE in a dose of 10 micrograms/kg."
CD009647,0,11212877,0,Whole-body hyperthermia with water-filtered infrared radiation: technical-physical aspects and clinical experiences.,"Among the different methods of whole-body hyperthermia (WBH), the energy transfer with infrared radiation seems to have established itself as a relatively simple procedure. The infrared systems differ with regard to the used spectrum of radiation. In the case of water-filtered infrared radiation, infrared A (760-1400 nm) is the focal point of heat radiation. This radiation penetrates deep into the skin up to the capillary area of the corium. Eighty treatments of patients in an advanced stage of cancer (40 male, 40 female, April 1998-April 1999) were performed with a WBH device with water-filtered infrared radiation, IRATHERM 2000. Extreme WBH was combined with induced hyperglycaemia and relative hyperoxaemia, and for 83% of the patients with chemotherapy as well. The body-core temperature was measured rectally (85%) or vesically. The objectives of the thermal control were a low rate of side-effects and a quick rise of the body-core temperature with regard to the condition of the patient's skin. The mean duration of the rising phase (37.5-41.5 degrees C) was 87 +/- 19 min. A correlation between lamp power and rising time (r = 0.08) was not found. Moreover, no correlation could be found between the appearance of thermal lesions > or = WHO 2nd degree and the lamp power. Thermal lesions according to WHO 1st, 2nd and 3rd degrees appeared in the case of 20, 15 and one treatment, respectively. Their area amounted in 2nd-degree cases to 0.08% of the body surface, on average. The highest mean temperature over 60 min (T60) was 42.1 +/- 0.1 degrees C, and the mean of maximum temperature (Tmax) was 42.3 +/- 0.1 degrees C. The mean thermal isoeffect dose EM43 was 35.8 +/- 6.3 min. WBH with water-filtered infrared radiation in combination with induced hyperglycaemia and relative hyperoxaemia (procedure of systemic Cancer Multistep Therapy) is a safe and practicable procedure with good tolerability in the case of experienced application. It permits a rapid rise of body-core temperature and a high thermal constancy in the plateau phase. An all-around access to the patient is possible in all therapy phases."

In most regional systems for palliative care, a supportive and sometimes an active therapeutic role is played by medical, nursing, paramedical and pastoral nursing home professionals. In view of the strong relationship between a poor or worsening nutritional state and fluid balance and death, particularly of psychogeriatric nursing-home patients, a multiprofessional guideline has been drawn up for the responsible provision of food and fluids in nursing homes. It is likely, although not certain, that this guideline will contribute to the limitation of the suffering of the dying patient. The guideline will in any case make the compassion of the family and the sympathy of care-givers discussible and almost always manageable. In many nursing homes, meanwhile, it has become accepted practice, soon after admission, to discuss the future suffering of the patient during the process of dying and to record this conversation."

CD009647,0,9403127,0,Fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in the elderly: physiological changes of ageing and clinical consequences.,"Characteristic of the normal ageing process are changes in the renal, hormonal and thirst regulatory systems involved in the control of sodium and water balance. In the presence of disease or drug use, the ageing changes put the elderly person at increased risk of either sodium retention or loss and of water retention or loss. Clinically, these alterations in water and sodium balance are commonly expressed as either hyponatraemia or hypernatraemia with central nervous system dysfunction as the symptomatic expression. Thus, the impaired homeostasis of the many systems affecting fluid balance in the elderly is readily influenced by many of the disease states and medications which are often present in the elderly with resultant adverse clinical consequences.

An inappropriate increase in ADH release of any cause produces hyponatremia by interfering with urinary dilution, thereby preventing the excretion of ingested water. Despite being the most common cause of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients, SIADH remains a diagnosis of exclusion. SIADH should be suspected in any patient with hyponatremia, hyposmolarity, urine osmolality above 100 mosmol/hgH2O, urine sodium concentration usually above 40 mEq/L, and clinical euvolemia. a number of modalities can be used to correct hyponatremia in SIADH, with water restriction and salt administration being the most important. The rate of correction is dependent upon the degree of hyponatremia and the presence or absence of symptoms. Patients with severe neurological symptoms require prompt correction; however, excessively rapid correction should be avoided because it can lead to the late onset of neurological complications from osmotic demyelination."

The subjects were divided in four groups as follows; 6 r-thoracal and abdominal esophagectomy (r-TA group); 4 l-thoracoabdominal total gastrectomy (1-TA group), 8 abdominal total gastrectomy (TMR group) and 10 partial gastrectomy (PMR group). Plasma alpha hANP levels in r-TA group were significantly higher than those in PMR group on the first, second, third and seventh postoperative days (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, those in 1-TA group were also significantly higher compared to those in PMR group on the second and seventh postoperative days (p less than 0.05). Significant correlation between plasma alpha hANP level and water balance was detected in transabdominal groups (TMR, PMR). However, this correlation was not found in thoracoabdominal groups (r-TA, l-TA). There was no correlation among alpha hANP level, heart rate and blood pressure. Serum and urinary Na/K ratio was lower in r-TA group, l-TA group, TMR group, and PMR group in descending order. Consequently, plasma alpha hANP level plays an important role in water-electrolyte metabolism during the perioperative period. A good group of the dynamic status of the secretion of alpha hANP levels might be a very useful index for the evaluation of the magnitude of surgical stress."
CD009647,0,14678708,1,[Accumulated fluid balance in patients admitted to the ICU: is it really reliable?].,"In most of the textbooks, it is considered that the balance calculated after admission and the losses measured and/or estimated is an inexact way of establishing the real balance. Thus daily monitoring of the weight variations is recommended as a single possible alternative. On the other hand, there are few studies that have strictly studied the reliability of the fluid balance calculated. We also have not found any study in middle-long stay critical patients. These circumstances have led us to design an observational prospective study that will allow us to know if the accumulated balance calculated after admission and loses adequately reflect the weight changes in middle-long stay patients. We include 20 patients who were weighed every 48 hours (at least 3 times each one) and we compare the weight changes with the balances calculated. We find that, above all after the 6th day, the accumulated balance calculated adequately reflected the weight changes (mean error/day < 250 ml), regardless of the presence or not of fever, sweat, oral diet, feces or mechanical ventilation. When weight on admission to the ICU was less than 75 kg, the changes in the balance calculated adjusted even more to the weight change, the contrary occurring when the weight was greater than 75 kg. These findings suggest that the accumulated balance calculated represents a valid alternative to daily weighing of the patients and that factors such as body mass and/or surface should be taken into account to reach more exact estimations."

Measurements were made before the infusion of mannitol (control) and at 15-min intervals for 1 hr. Control measurements showed normal hemodynamic data, while blood volume was lower than normal (P less than 0.001). Immediately after the mannitol infusion cardiac index (25%; P less than 0.01), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (48%; P less than 0.001), and blood volume (43%; P less than 0.001) increased. Thirty minutes after the mannitol infusion, blood volume had returned to control levels, while the cardiac index and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased 21% (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively) below control levels. Forty-five minutes after the mannitol infusion, serum osmolality and urine volume remained high. Our data confirm the presence of hypovolemia in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and a transient increase in blood volume associated with the infusion of mannitol. The data emphasize, however, that the hemodynamic response is biphasic, with an initial increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac index, followed by a hypokinetic circulatory pattern with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac index below control levels. The hypokinetic state occurred in spite of return of blood volume to control levels, suggesting that redistribution of blood from central to peripheral circulatory compartments had occurred."

CD009647,0,7792035,0,Determination of the relation between alterations of total body water and thoracic fluid content during ultrafiltration by bioelectrical impedance analysis.,"Total body impedance (TBI) is used to monitor alterations in total body water (TBW), e.g. during haemodialysis. However, 80% of the TBI signal is due to the resistance in extremities. Therefore TBI measurements give little information about alterations in thoracic fluid content (TF). Measuring both total body impedance and thoracic impedance (THI) can be a useful method to monitor TBW and TF changes during haemodialysis. In this study TBI and THI measurements were performed during 30 dialysis sessions and also in one group of 24 control subjects with normal tissue hydration. During haemodialysis TBI and THI significantly increased, demonstrating a decrease of TBW and TF. The ratio THI/TBI did not differ significantly during haemodialysis, indicating a similar effect of ultrafiltration on TBW and TF. The finding that TF decreased during haemodialysis was rather surprising, whereas pulmonary oedema is not an evident clinical problem in patients on maintenance haemodialysis treatment. THI measurements after dialysis proved to be significantly higher in comparison to the control subjects. This finding supports the hypothesis that the decrease in TF during dialysis is partly due to the sudden ultrafiltration-induced hypovolaemia leading to a fall in thoracic blood volume."

We generated a regression model for bioelectrical impedance (BI) by using deuterium dilution (2H2O) as a reference method in 32 COPD patients, aged 63 +/- 9 y (mean +/- SD), in stable pulmonary and cardiac condition. Height squared divided by resistance (Ht2/Res) correlated well with total body water (TBW) as measured by 2H2O (r = 0.93, P less than 0.001, SEE = 1.9 L). The best-fitting regression equation to predict TBW comprised Ht2/Res and body weight (r2 = 0.89, SEE = 1.8 L, P less than 0.001). BI-predicted TBW was used to estimate BI-fat-free mass (FFM) that was compared with skinfold-thickness-based FFM predictions (Anthr-FFM). Relative to BI-FFM a significant overestimation of 4.4 +/- 0.8 kg was found by Anthr-FFM. Our results suggest that BI is a useful measure of body composition in patients with severe COPD."

The induction of anesthesia was very smooth, but the patient's blood pressure became unstable during the operation. As a result, we inserted an arterial catheter into the radial artery, and the blood gas analysis showed severe hyperglycemia and hyponatremia. We determined that a massive amount of intraperitoneal lavage fluid with 5% glucose had been absorbed into the blood vessels. We administered regular insulin to manage the hyperglycemia and also mannitol and furosemide to treat the hyponatremia that had been caused by water intoxication. Thereafter, both the hyperglycemia and hyponatremia improved quickly, and the patient was extubated safely. We had little prior knowledge about pseudomyxoma peritonei, and therefore had not expected such an occurrence. Moreover we did not sufficiently provide the surgical team with all of the patient's information.

Present study was undertaken to elucidate the sympathetic nervous activity in terms of biogenic amines [plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E) concentrations, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity (DBH) and plasma serotonin (5-HT) concentration] in 17 patients with chronic renal failure in whom renal hemodialysis were continuously performed. During pre-dialysis period, in these hemodialysis patients, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and plasma 5-HT were significantly elevated as compared with those on sex and age-matched controls; plasma NE and plasma DBH were not changed in these hemodialysis patients as compared with those in controls. After hemodialysis, increased plasma NE and increased DBH were observed in parallel with the significant weight loss. Mean blood pressure did not change after dialysis. Dialysis produced an increasing tendency of heart rate. Dialysis also produced a significant decrease in plasma 5-HT. Hemodialysis-induced weight loss was approximately 2 kg body weight after 5 hours dialysis; these patients were done 3 times dialysis during one week. However, hypotension and dizziness were not demonstrated under this condition. Present study revealed that long term maintenance hemodialysis produced increased sympathetic nervous system activity; the assumed explanation would be relevant to the simultaneous recovery of baroreflex sensitivity and sympathetic tone, because of the long-term continuous hemodialysis."

A 70 year old female presented with weight loss, constipation and dehydration. Investigations revealed marked hypercalcaemia with a non-suppressed PTH. In view of the degree of hypercalcaemia as well as the unintentional weight loss, investigations for malignancy were conducted -these were negative. Parathyroid imaging was then requested and an adenoma was identified. Surprisingly, surgery revealed the coexistence of a parathyroid adenoma with the unexpected finding of sarcoid granulomas within the parathyroid and thyroid glands. To our knowledge, this is the first such case reported. Further imaging confirmed pulmonary sarcoidosis and a serum ACE was elevated.

CD009647,0,870267,0,Symptoms and course of chronic hypokalemic nephropathy in man.,"The symptoms and clinical course of chronic hypokalemic nephropathy are described in 21 patients with longstanding potassium deficiency. In 14 patients (group A) the potassium depletion was caused by malnutrition and/or abuse of laxatives and/or diuretics. 7 patients (group B) suffered from primary (6 cases) or secondary (1 case) aldosteronism. The average duration of potassium depletion was 8.8 years in group A and 3.4 years in group B. Depending on the duration of potassium depletion, chronic renal disease develops which may end in terminal renal failure. Urinalysis is non-specific or negative. The clearance of creatinine slowly decreases. Metabolic alkalosis is a constant finding and in group A occurs with a tendency to hyponatremia and hypochloremia, with the development of metabolic acidosis only in advanced renal insufficiency. In contrast to patients of group B, patients of group A have normal or low blood pressures converting to hypertension, if at all only in the late phase. The cases of group A had secondary aldosteronism (and, correspondingly, a hyperplastic juxtaglomerular apparatus). Although urinary tract infection is a regular finding in advanced stages, the clinical, radiological and histological evidence suggests that bacterial pyelonephritis, if occurring at all, is rather a complication than the cause of the disease. In 5 patients 7 instances of acute renal failure of unknown origin were observed which was lethal in one case. Another patient died from terminal renal failure, a third from an intercurrent pneumonia. Renal histology obtained from 13 patients showed the picture of diffuse chronic abacterial interstitial nephritis."

From the physiopathological standpoint, the syndrome is rarely coupled with an absolute water deficiency. More commonly, sodium and water losses go together to bring about a fall in both intracellular and extracellular volume. The clinical significance of hypernatriaemia is essentially linked to increased osmolar content, not only of the extracellular liquid, but more particularly (due to water depletion) of the intracellular compartment, which underlies the establishment and progress of the anatomopathological lesions and the clinical symptoms."

In this prospective descriptive trial, we evaluated a new noninvasive method--dielectric constant of skin and subcutaneous fat (SSF)--in assessing fluid balance during cardiac surgery. The dielectric constant at the applied high radiofrequency is a direct measure of tissue water content. Twenty-nine patients with elective cardiac surgery participated in the study. Dielectric constants on forearm, thigh and abdomen were measured before surgery, within 1 h after surgery and in the first, second, third and fourth postoperative morning. At the same time the patients were weighed, except immediately after the operation and the first postoperative day when fluid balances were calculated. A statistically significant correlation (r = 0.60, p < 0.01) was found between the increase of the dielectric constant of SSF and weight gain of the patients from the baseline to the second postoperative morning. From the second to the fourth postoperative day when the patients were losing the weight, a statistical significant correlation between the dielectric constant and weight loss was not found. The results suggest that the measurement of the dielectric constant is a promising new method in assessing the fluid status of operated patients during the time the patients cannot be weighed."
CD009647,0,15070970,0,A novel mutation in the preprovasopressin gene identified in a kindred with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.,"Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (ADNDI) is a defect in free water conservation caused by mutations in the single gene that encodes both vasopressin (VP) and its binding protein, neurophysin II (NP II). Most of the human mutations in this gene have been in the portion encoding the NP molecule; the resultant abnormal gene products are believed to cause cellular toxicity as improperly folded precursor molecules accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. We identified a new American kindred with ADNDI and found a novel mutation in the VP molecule. A 78-yr-old man was noted to have hypotonic polyuria and plasma hyperosmolarity; the urinary concentration defect was reversed by administration of VP. His symptomatology dated to childhood, and his family history was consistent with autosomal transmission of the polyuric syndrome, with affected members in three generations, including several females. Affected individuals were found to be heterozygous for a 3-bp deletion in exon 1 of arginine VP (AVP)-NP II, predicting a deletion of phenylalanine 3 (known to be critical for receptor binding) in the VP nonapeptide. Neuro 2A cells stably transfected with the mutant AVP-NP construct showed increased rates of apoptosis as assessed by flow cytometric methods. These observations support the concept that cellular toxicity of abnormal AVP-NP gene products underlies the development of ADNDI, and the data further demonstrate that mutations affecting the AVP moiety can result in initiation of these pathological processes."

Patient tolerance was good but close medical and nursing supervision in monitoring fluid balance and adverse reactions to replacement fluids is necessary. Plasmapheresis has been established to be of benefit in immunoproliferative diseases when complicated by hyperviscosity, and may also have a place in other cases with haemostatic or renal impairment. Autoantibodies, alloantibodies and immune complexes can be removed by plasmapheresis, but the effect is usually transient and the procedure should be combined with immunosuppressive therapy in most cases. The removal of blocking factors in disseminated malignant melanoma is an experimental procedure at present, but initial results have been encouraging."

The subjects were studied in 12 subgroups spread over all four seasons. Total serum calcium, inorganic phosphate, total protein, albumin and urinary calcium and magnesium were determined. Circadian rhythms were found in all variables. There were statistically significant phase differences between serum calcium, total protein and serum albumin speaking against the serum protein rhythm (or circadian variations in hydration) being responsible for the circadian rhythm in total serum calcium. There are phase differences between the elderly (and young) subjects studied in Romania and several series reported from Germany and the USA. Circadian and circannual variations were found for urinary calcium and magnesium excretion, with maximum in fall and low values during summer. The peak excretion thus follows, rather than coincides, with the time of maximum sun exposure. The elderly subjects studied in Romania show a relatively low circadian (24-hour) mean calcium excretion, and the circadian acrophase in the elderly occurs during the night hours in keeping with the acrophase shift found in elderly subjects in urine volume and other electrolytes."

Since increase of furosemide worsened the hyponatremia (120 mmol/l), 30 g/day of urea was added and induced the following changes: progressive weight loss (6.5 kg in one week), increased diuresis (from 0.750 to 1.950 l/day), increased salt excretion (from 40 to 165 mmol sodium/day) and correction of the hyponatremia (120 to 136 mmol/l).

CD009647,0,1972002,0,A century of home parenteral nutrition for Crohn's disease.,"During an 11-year period, 41 patients with Crohn's disease were placed on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) for a mean of 1,083 days (range: 33 to 3,258 days). Data were retrospectively analyzed to determine whether HPN had an effect on the course of their disease, i.e., on the number of operative procedures performed and the intensity of required medical therapy. Data represented information obtained during a total of 121 patient-years of HPN for Crohn's disease. The main indications for HPN were short bowel syndrome (66%) and high stoma output. Twenty-four of 41 patients (59%) underwent surgery for Crohn's disease during the course of HPN. There was no significant difference between the number of procedures performed per patient per year of Crohn's disease during pre-HPN and HPN periods (p greater than 0.25). Although there was no significant change in body weight, both serum albumin and transferrin levels increased during HPN (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.01, respectively). Twenty-nine percent of patients were taking prednisone while on HPN, compared with 54% of patients during the pre-HPN period (p less than 0.01). HPN appeared to result in a significant improvement in the numerically assessed quality of life. During the HPN period, 24 patients had 1 or more HPN-related complications that required 1 to 13 hospital admissions (mean: 1.8). These complications included catheter sepsis in 19 patients, blocked or damaged catheters in 15 patients, and dehydration and/or electrolyte imbalance in 5 patients. Eight patients died, with 7% of deaths secondary to catheter-related sepsis. Although permanent HPN is associated with an identifiable morbidity and mortality and is not associated with a reduction in the frequency of surgery for Crohn's disease, benefits include a decrease in the intensity of medical therapy, an improvement in patients' nutritional state, and a significant perceived improvement in patients' quality of life. Without HPN, we believe all patients would have died secondary to malnutrition and/or dehydration."

A comparison of cuprophane, polyacrylonitrile, and polysulfone membranes.","Critically ill patients with ARF and MOSF were treated with continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD). The BSM 22 delivery system (CGH Medical, Denver, CO) and four different dialyzer membranes were used. Vascular access was achieved with a dual lumen catheter placed percutaneously into a large vein. Heparin was used for anticoagulation, and commercially available peritoneal dialysis fluid was used as dialysate. At a fixed blood flow rate of 100 ml/min, the dialysate inflow and outflow rates were regulated to control azotemia and fluid balance. Blood side and dialysate side clearances for urea nitrogen, creatinine, bicarbonate, and lactate were measured. All dialyzer membranes studied provided high urea nitrogen clearance approximating dialysate outflow rate and resulting in excellent control of azotemia. Some of the dialyzer membranes also had high creatinine and bicarbonate clearances. Bicarbonate loss was balanced by lactate uptake with all dialyzers. It is concluded that CVVHD is an efficient and safe therapy for acute renal failure, capable of maintaining nitrogen balance in patients with protein catabolic rates up to 2 g/kg/day. Urea nitrogen clearance is dependent upon dialysate outflow rate rather than the dialyzer membrane type or dialyzer flow geometry, and may prove to be the modality of choice for therapy of acute renal failure in unstable patients with MOSF."

CD009647,0,22747849,0,Mathematical modeling of thermal and circulatory effects during hemodialysis.,"Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is one of the most common complications of hemodialysis (HD) treatment. The initiating factor of IDH is a decrease in blood volume, which is related to an imbalance between ultrafiltration (UF) and refilling rate. Impaired reactivity of resistance and capacitance vessels in reaction to hypovolemia plays possibly a major role in the occurrence of IDH. These vessels also fulfill an important function in body temperature regulation. UF-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction would result in a reduced surface heat loss and an increase in core temperature. To release body heat, skin blood flow is increased at a later stage of the HD treatment, whereby possibly IDH can occur. The aim of the study is to develop a mathematical model that can provide insight into the impact of thermoregulatory processes on the cardiovascular (CV) system during HD treatment. The mathematical procedure has been created by coupling a thermo-physiological model with a CV model to study regulation mechanisms in the human body during HD + UF. Model simulations for isothermal versus thermoneutral HD + UF were compared with measurement data of patients on chronic intermittent HD (n = 13). Core temperature during simulated HD + UF sessions increased within the range of measurement data (0.23°C vs. 0.32 ± 0.41°C). The model showed a decline in mean arterial pressure of -7% for thermoneutral HD + UF versus -4% for isothermal HD + UF after 200 min during which relative blood volume changed by -13%. In conclusion, simulation results of the combined model show possibilities for predicting circulatory and thermal responses during HD + UF."

One week before admission, she was suffering from pneumonia, and had appetite loss, fever, and severe fatigue. Physical examination revealed dehydration. The electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed atrioventricular dissociation, idioventricular rhythm with marked QRS widening and QTc prolongation. The plasma concentration of pilsicainide on admission was markedly elevated at 6.2 microg/ml, approximately 6 times the therapeutic range (0.25-1.0 microg/ml). Continuous saline infusion was initiated for the treatment of dehydration,which progressively improved. As a result, sinus rhythm was recovered 2 h after admission, and the QRS and JT intervals gradually normalized. This is an interesting case because the proarrhythmia of pilsicainide was induced by dehydration."

CD009647,0,7481965,0,Rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric acute renal failure associated with classic heat stroke.,"Classic heat stroke is a disorder of thermal regulation that predominantly affects elderly patients during heat waves. In contrast to exertional heat stroke, rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric acute renal failure are considered to be unusual manifestations of classic heat stroke. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of seven patients admitted to Maimonides Medical Center with classic heat stroke over a 3-day period during a heat wave in July 1993. Three of these patients with classic heat stroke had rhabdomyolysis, but no renal failure; two completely recovered; and one had an ataxic gait disturbance. Three additional patients had rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric acute renal failure; one of them completely recovered, one survived with quadriplegia, and one died. Our findings suggest that rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric acute renal failure are common manifestations of classic heat stroke. Recognition of this complication warrants rigorous hydration and alkalinization of the urine to prevent or attenuate myoglobinuric acute renal failure."
CD009647,0,14681719,0,Mild dehydration: a risk factor of constipation?,"Constipation defined as changes in the frequency, volume, weight, consistency and ease of passage of the stool occurs in any age group. The most important factors known to promote constipation are reduced physical activity and inadequate dietary intake of fibres, carbohydrates and fluids. Fluid losses induced by diarrhoea and febrile illness alter water balance and promote constipation. When children increase their water consumption above their usual intake, no change in stool frequency and consistency was observed. The improvement of constipation by increasing water intake, therefore, may be effective in children only when voluntary fluid consumption is lower-than-normal for the child's age and activity level. In the elderly, low fluid intake, which may be indicative of hypohydration, was a cause of constipation and a significant relationship between liquid deprivation from 2500 to 500 ml per day and constipation was reported. Dehydration is also observed when saline laxatives are used for the treatment of constipation if fluid replacement is not maintained and may affect the efficacy of the treatment. While sulphate in drinking water does not appear to have a significant laxative effect, fluid intake and magnesium sulphate-rich mineral waters were shown to improve constipation in healthy infants. In conclusion, fluid loss and fluid restriction and thus de-or hypohydration increase constipation. It is thus important to maintain euhydration as a prevention of constipation."

Simple repair of the PEH has a high recurrence rate and may be associated with poor gastric function. We compared a series of patients who underwent repair of large PEH plus gastrostomy tube gastropexy (PEH-GT) with PEH plus sleeve gastrectomy (PEH-SG). Retrospective review of patients undergoing PEH-SG and patients with PEH-GT was performed. We assessed symptoms of delayed gastric emptying and reflux postoperatively. In selected patients, gastric-emptying studies and upper gastrointestinal contrast studies were also obtained. All patients with large PEH were repaired laparoscopically with sac resection, primary crural closure using pledgeted sutures, and biologic patch onlay. SG for patients undergoing concomitant weight loss surgery (PEH-SG) was performed with linear endoscopic staplers and staple line reinforcement. Patients undergoing PEH repair alone had a gastrostomy tube gastropexy (PEH-GT). Patients had intraoperative endoscopic evaluation and postoperative contrast swallow studies. In a 12-month period, five patients underwent laparoscopic PEH-SG; two of five had previous antireflux surgery and one of five with a previous diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying. Postoperatively, two patients undergoing PEH-SG had readmission for dehydration and odynophagia. Six-month follow-up body mass index was 32 kg/m2 for the PEH-SG group with no hernia recurrence and complete resolution of gastroesophageal reflux disorder symptoms. Six patients underwent PEH-GT, one for acute incarceration and anemia and four with previous antireflux surgery. Follow up at 8 months demonstrated one recurrence, four of six had severe delayed gastric emptying and reflux, three of six had additional hospitalization for poor oral intake, and three of six underwent reoperation for delayed gastric emptying. There were no perforations, leaks, or deaths in either group. Combined laparoscopic PEH-SG is a clinically reasonable option for patients with morbid obesity with minimal additional risks and decreased incidence of delayed gastric emptying, reflux, and reoperation."

CD009647,0,10535661,0,New insights into body composition assessment in obese women.,"During treatment of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, there may be marked body weight loss. Therefore, body composition should be monitored to check for a decrease in fat mass alone, without an excessive decrease of both fat-free mass and total body water. Accordingly, it is useful to monitor the hydration of these patients. One method that allows us to check the status of body hydration is the multifrequency bioelectric impedance analysis (MFBIA). It makes use of formulas that estimate total body water on the basis of the concept that the human body may be approximated to a cylinder of length equal to body height. In normal subjects body water estimates are sufficiently accurate, but in obese subjects the true hydration status may be overestimated. In this report, we describe the accuracy of mathematical models previously described in the literature, and correct for the overestimation of total body water in obese subjects by means of a new equation based on a new model. The coefficients for each model have been recalculated by the weighing of our sample in order to test the accuracy of estimates obtained with the equations. This new model includes both body volume and two impedances at appropriate frequencies useful for identifying two terms strictly related to extra- and intra-cellular water. The new formulas do not include body weight, but they include the body volume, a parameter more closely related to the biophysical reference model. Fifty-five overweight females, body mass index ranging from 26.8 to 50.2 kg/m2, were enrolled in the study. The proposed equations, taking advantage of two impedance values at appropriate frequencies, better predict total body water in obese women. This was particularly evident when the results obtained with the multifrequency bioelectric impedance analysis and deuterium isotopic oxide dilution method were compared. Although this last method is considered the ""gold standard,"" it is not suitable for use in routine clinical practice. In conclusion, evaluation of total body composition by means of bioelectric impedance analysis might be included in programs for the prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes and for monitoring weight loss during overt pathology."
CD009647,0,8258960,0,Non-invasive monitoring of blood volume during hemodialysis: its relation with post-dialytic dry weight.,"Hemodialysis has a profound effect on fluid balance. Since fluid is initially withdrawn from the intravascular compartment, blood volume will decrease rapidly. A fluid shift (refill) from the overhydrated interstitium towards the intravascular compartment counteracts hypovolemia. Underestimation of postdialytic dry weight will cause interstitial dehydration and consequently a low refill capacity. This can cause hypovolemia-induced hypotension, a serious problem in the daily practice of hemodialysis: during one out of three sessions a hypotensive episode occurs. Clinical criteria to estimate post-dialytic dry weight are insensitive. We have developed non-invasive methods to estimate dry weight and changes in blood volume (BV) more accurately. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between hydration state of the patient and changes in BV during treatment. Therefore, 37 hemodialysis patients were divided into three groups according to their post-dialytic extracellular fluid volume (EFV), which was measured by means of the non-invasive conductivity method: de- (N = 11), normo- (N = 18), and overhydrated (N = 8). Using an on-line optical reflection method, changes in BV were measured continuously during hemodialysis. BV decrease, corrected for ultrafiltration, was stronger in the dehydrated (4.4 +/- 1.5%/liter) than in the normohydrated (3.3 +/- 1.5%/liter) and overhydrated (2.7 +/- 1.9%/liter) groups. In the dehydrated group, the frequency of hypotensive episodes (48.5 +/- 20.2%) was significantly greater compared to the normohydrated (20.5 +/- 23.5%) or overhydrated (6.5 +/- 6.5%) group, P < 0.005.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Most probably due to preoperatively depleted glycogen storages in G 2, the urinary carbohydrate losses declined more rapidly postoperatively compared with G 1. 45 mMol/l of sodium did not cover the postoperative requirements of G 1. Although we administered 90 mMol/l of potassium/24 h, several patients of G 1 needed an additional substitution. No additional phosphate substitution was necessary in either group. Except for a slight positive balance on the operation day, fluid balance was well balanced on all the other days in G 1. From postoperative day 2 on, G 2 developed a deficit of free water. It could be demonstrated very clear in this study that the postoperative fluid and electrolyte requirements are strongly influenced even by a short-term preoperative fasting period."

However, there is little information available evaluating the MO for routine, short-term cardiopulmonary bypass. In this study the 5MO314 Modulung-Teflo (MO) was compared to 5M30314 Miniprime Variflo (BO). The data of 91 patients (46 MO and 45 BO) were analyzed according to the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (Group I less than 60 min., Group II 60-90 min. and Group III greater than 90 min.). Hemodynamic parameters, fluid and blood balance, as well as hematologic and blood gas studies were used for comparing the two oxygentors. The hemodynamic parameters were better, and the arterial blood gases were more physilogic with the MO. The postoperative blood loss was significantly less when using the MO. The other measurements documented the stability of the MO. All statements were based on statistical analysis with a DEC PDP-9 computer, using the MIIS language and operating system. Consequently, we are now using this MO for routine cardiopulmonary bypass."

In each instance the increased urine volume was preceded by a sharp increase in blood urea nitrogen, presumably due to absorption of nitrogenous compounds from the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting a mechanism of osmotic diuresis. In each case there was a signigicant increase in serum sodium and osmolality, related to the greater-water-than-sodium diuresis induced by urea, which was promptly reversed by the administration of water or isotonic solution. Clinically this syndrome may be defined as the association of hypernatremia and hyperosmolality due to osmotic diuresis from urea appearing in a cirrhotic patient with ascites and gastrointestinal bleeding."

The possible etiology of the renal failure was multiple in all cases and did not differ from that seen in oliguric acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Other than the urine volume, which ranged from 510 to 2,325 ml/day, there was no major clinical or biochemical difference between these cases of nonliguric ARF and those described for oliguric ATN. Creatinine clearance, however, was higher than anticipated in oliguric ATN and ranged from 2.8 to 15.0 ml/min. There was a direct relationship between creatinine clearance and daily urine volume. The essential difference between oliguric and nonoliguric renal failure appears to be the lesser degree of renal damage in the nonoliguric form."
CD009647,0,3218897,0,The sauna and body fluid balance.,"Sauna bathing may affect the fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance. In addition to sweating and thirst, a sauna bath also has effects on many endogenous regulatory mechanisms maintaining the balance between the fluid compartments and appropriate distribution of the circulating blood. Although the sauna-induced fluid loss is usually not very severe, its adequate replacement as early as possible is important. In practice, the most convenient and effective way is to replace the fluid loss by small liquid doses repeated frequently during the bathing. If a sauna bath is taken after heavy physical activity, the fluid compensation may be necessary already before bathing."
CD009647,0,1668378,0,Evaluation of preoperative and postoperative sodium and water loading in patients undergoing hepatectomy for liver cirrhosis complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Evaluation of postoperative disturbance in the sodium and water balance was made in eight patients with compensated liver cirrhosis who had undergone segmental hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma and had received unrestricted administration of sodium and water to maintain a normal urine output. On postoperative day 3, a significantly higher plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level and a significantly lower plasma aldosterone level were noted compared with postoperative day 1: the hormonal levels on postoperative day 3 were similar to the postinfusion levels obtained by the preoperative saline-loading test, which was performed to assess the physiological control of effective extracellular fluid and blood volume. Pulmonary artery and pulmonary wedge pressures were slightly, but significantly, higher on postoperative day 3 than on postoperative day 1. These results suggest that unrestricted fluid management prevents the depletion of effective extracellular fluid and blood volume on postoperative day 1, and permits their slight excess on postoperative day 3."

A cross-sectional study of 149 hypertensive patients with hypokalemia (<4 mmol/dL) or elevated serum bicarbonate (>25 mmol/dL) was conducted at a Veterans' Administration Medical Center Hypertension Clinic in Shreveport, LA. Data on demographics, blood pressure, and select blood tests were collected and expressed as percentages for categoric variables and as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables. Patients were diagnosed with likely LS when the plasma renin activity (PRA) was <0.35 μU/mL/h and the aldosterone was <15 ng/dL and likely primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA) with PRA <0.35 μU/mL/h and aldosterone level >15 ng/dL. The cohort included predominantly elderly (67.1±13.4 years), male (96%), and Caucasian (57%) patients. The average blood pressure was 143.8/79.8 mm Hg±27.11/15.20 with 3.03±1.63 antihypertensive drugs. Based on the above criteria, 9 patients (6%) satisfied the criteria for likely LS and 10 patients (6.7%) were diagnosed with likely PHA.

CD009647,0,10961485,0,Changes of bioelectrical impedance after a body weight reduction program in highly obese subjects.,"We used bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as an exploratory tool to monitor the changes in body composition induced by a short-term (3-wk) weight reduction (energy-restricted diet, moderate aerobic exercise conditioning and psychological counselling) in 175 highly obese subjects (body mass index, BMI=41.7+/-5.8 kg/m2). The decrease in weight and BMI after the weight reduction program was 3.4% (geometric mean, p<0.0001) and 3.7+/-1.3 kg/m2 (mean+/-SD, p<0.0001), respectively. Bioelectrical impedance (Z) increased of about the same value at each of the measured frequencies (from 6+/-10% at 5 kHz to 5+/-9% at 100 kHz, mean+/-SD, p<0.0001). A statistically significant increase in Z5:Z100 was also seen (p<0.0001), but its clinical significance is questionable owing to its low absolute value (<1%). Taken together, these data suggest that no clinically relevant change in body water distribution occurred in our subjects as a result of the weight reduction program. However, the changes in Z did not satisfactorily predict the changes in anthropometric dimensions despite the evidence of a substantial association between Z and anthropometry both before and after the weight reduction program. Thus, accurate predictions of body composition changes in obese subjects may require more than two BIA measurements so as to have a better description of the weight-losing process."

CD009647,0,9740545,0,A phase I and pharmacokinetic trial of terephthalamidine (NSC 57155) as a 120-hour continuous infusion.,"In this phase I study, terephthalamidine was administered as a 120-hour continuous infusion repeated every 21 days. Thirteen patients received 27 courses of terephthalamidine at four dose levels ( 14, 28, 46, and 70 mg/m2/day). Dose-limiting toxicity consisted of profound and intractable anorexia, weight loss and prostration in all patients. Toxicity was delayed and accompanied by hyponatremia and hypokalemia. No hematologic or other toxicity was documented. One patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung had a 40% decrease in mediastinal lymph nodes and resolution of a pleural effusion lasting 2 months. Pharmacokinetic analysis by HPLC was performed in all patients during their first course. The harmonic mean terminal half-life for terephthalamidine was 23 hours with a plasma clearance of 1.7 1/hr/m2. Both plasma concentrations achieved during infusion (r2 = 0.9) and area under the curve (AUC) (r2 = 0.8) were proportional to increase in dose (p < 0.002). Renal excretion accounted for 64% of the total cumulative dose, with an average renal clearance of 1.16 1/hr/m2.

CD009647,0,16901913,0,Nerve excitability changes in critical illness polyneuropathy.,"Patients in intensive care units frequently suffer muscle weakness and atrophy due to critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), an axonal neuropathy associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure. CIP is a frequent and serious complication of intensive care that delays weaning from mechanical ventilation and increases mortality. The pathogenesis of CIP is not well understood and no specific therapy is available. The aim of this project was to use nerve excitability testing to investigate the changes in axonal membrane properties occurring in CIP. Ten patients (aged 37-76 years; 7 males, 3 females) were studied with electrophysiologically proven CIP. The median nerve was stimulated at the wrist and compound action potentials were recorded from abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Strength-duration time constant, threshold electrotonus, current-threshold relationship and recovery cycle (refractoriness, superexcitability and late subexcitability) were recorded using a recently described protocol. In eight patients a follow-up investigation was performed. All patients underwent clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Compared with age-matched normal controls (20 subjects; aged 38-79 years; 7 males, 13 females), CIP patients exhibited reduced superexcitability at 7 ms, from -22.3 +/- 1.6% to -7.6 +/- 3.1% (mean +/- SE, P approximately 0.0001) and increased accommodation to depolarizing (P < 0.01) and hyperpolarizing currents (P < 0.01), indicating membrane depolarization. Superexcitability was reduced both in patients with renal failure and without renal failure. In the former, superexcitability correlated with serum potassium (R = 0.88), and late subexcitability was also reduced (as also occurs owing to hyperkalaemia in patients with chronic renal failure). In patients without renal failure, late subexcitability was normal, and the signs of membrane depolarization correlated with raised serum bicarbonate and base excess, indicating compensated respiratory acidosis. It is inferred that motor axons in these CIP patients are depolarized, in part because of raised extracellular potassium, and in part because of hypoperfusion. The chronic membrane depolarization may contribute to the development of neuropathy."

Of 1,280 subjects, 122 were selected for further studies and allocated into 4 groups: 1) no CVD, non-smokers; 2) no CVD, smokers; 3) CVD, smokers; and 4) CVD, non-smokers. The smokers had consumed on the average 13 g of tobacco daily for 59 years. Lean body mass (LBM), body fat (BF), % body fat (%BF), and total body water (TBW) were estimated by means of bioelectrical impedance analysis. The mean body weight (BW), LBM, and %BF for all subjects were 74.1 +/- 10.2 kg, 58.0 +/- 6.8 kg, and 21.3 +/- 5.9 kg, respectively. There were no significant differences between all subjects with and without CVD. A lower BW among smokers than in non-smokers was explained by lower BF and %BF in the former. Smokers who had lived predominantly in rural areas had lower BW (6.9 kg) and LBM (5.2 kg) than those from an urban area. A positive correlation was noted between the degree of physical activity and LBM and TBW. Seventeen percent of the smokers exercised regularly. The CVD group had higher plasma cholesterol concentrations than the non-CVD group. Plasma triglycerides showed a positive correlation with BF, %BF and BW, whereas HDL cholesterol was negatively correlated with BF, %BF and BW. It is concluded that smoking is one of several important factors related to body composition, and the penetrance of this factor is still apparent in elderly men."

CD009647,0,29737,0,The influence of dialysis fluid composition on the blood pressure response during dialysis.,"To elucidate the relative role of osmolar (sodium) and acetate shifts during dialysis, 6 patients with problems of overhydration underwent rapid ultrafiltration for 1 hr (mean weight reduction 2.0 kg), using the 1 m2 RP 6 dialyzer. Ultrafiltration was carried out at the beginning of each of 5 dialysis treatments at weekly intervals. Ultrafiltration was undertaken without dialysis (controls) and with simultaneous dialysis using acetate (40 mmoles/1) or bicarbonate (25 mmoles/1) in the dialysis fluid with dialyzate sodium concentration of 133 and 145 mmoles/1. The systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure which were stable with ultrafiltration only fell slightly when a high dialyzate sodium concentration was used and much further when the dialyzate sodium concentration was kept low. These changes were apparently related to the changes in plasma osmolality. Acetate had no effect on blood pressure at the higher sodium concentration, but a slight (insignificant) additive effect when used in the low-sodium dialyzate. Shifts in osmolality (sodium concentration) seem to be more important than the effect of acetate in inducing dialysis-associated hypotension."

The abdomen was soft, tender on palpation, not distended without rebound tenderness. The arterial blood gases revealed marked lactic acidosis and the laboratory tests on admission showed acute renal failure. The patient received nine treatments of slow continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVHF). Despite the prolonged period of anuria, urine output progressively improved after 25 days and serum biochemical parameters of renal function returned to normal within 40 days.

Initial TEWL rates (mean +/- SD) were found to differ significantly between young (28.6 +/- 7.5 g/m2/hr; n = 26) and old (36.9 +/- 10.5 g/m2/hr; n = 18) subjects (P less than 0.01). Relaxation of TEWL to J infinity was significantly slower in the aged cohort, such that the characteristic time for diffusion of water in the stratum corneum was estimated to be (mean +/- SD) 176 +/- 59 min for the young subjects, compared to 360 +/- 76 min for the old (P less than 0.001.). Thus, the initial TEWL value following removal of occlusion is significantly greater, and the excessive stratum corneum hydration produced by occlusion is dissipated more slowly, in old skin than in young. A hypothesis to explain the slower relaxation of perturbed TEWL in old skin is proposed."
CD009647,0,22684924,0,"Dysphagia, nutrition, and hydration in ischemic stroke patients at admission and discharge from acute care.","Dysphagia may predispose stroke patients toward undernutrition and hydration. These comorbidities increase patient risks for reduced functional outcome and short-term mortality. Despite this impact, available information on relationships among dysphagia, nutrition, and hydration status in acute stroke is limited and conflicted. This study evaluated nutrition and hydration status in ischemic stroke patients with versus without clinically significant dysphagia at admission and at discharge from acute care. Sixty-seven patients admitted to the stroke unit in a tertiary-care hospital provided data for this study. On the day of hospital admission and upon discharge or at 7 days post admission, serum biochemical measures were obtained for nutrition (prealbumin) and hydration status (BUN/Cr). Clinical evaluation for dysphagia, nutrition status, and stroke severity were completed an average of 1.4 days following hospital admission. Dysphagia was identified in 37 % of the cohort. At admission 32 % of patients demonstrated malnutrition based on prealbumin levels and 53 % demonstrated evidence of dehydration based on BUN/Cr levels. No differences in nutrition status were attributed to dysphagia. Patients with dysphagia demonstrated significantly higher BUN/Cr levels (greater dehydration) than patients without dysphagia at admission and at discharge. Dehydration at both admission and discharge was associated with dysphagia, clinical nutrition status, and stroke severity. Results of this study support prior results indicating that dysphagia is not associated with poor nutrition status during the first week post stroke. Dehydration status is associated with dysphagia during this period. The results have implications for future confirmatory research and for clinical management of dysphagia in the acute stroke period."
CD009647,0,12452249,0,Circadian rhythm of some parameters of body composition in the elderly investigated by means of bioelectrical impedance analysis.,"We studied the within-day determinations of some body composition (BC) parameters in clinically healthy elderly subjects with the aim of investigating their circadian rhythms (CR), which are known to vary in a circadian manner in clinically healthy young adults. The study involved six non-smoking, clinically healthy elderly males (mean age: 75 +/- 4 years; mean weight: 71.07 +/- 10.26 kg; mean height: 170 +/- 5 cm, mean BMI: 24 +/- 1 kg/m2). The BC parameters were determined by means of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) at 2-hour intervals during the day and night, with the subjects lying horizontally in bed. The time-qualified BC estimates were analysed using the Cosinor method. The analysis revealed that the healthy elderly subjects had lost the CR of a number of the BC parameters, including fat body mass, cell body mass, extracellular body mass, total body water, extracellular body water, intracellular body water, and the Na and K exchangeable pools. However, they still retained the CR of body weight and lean body mass, with the expected nocturnal phase of oscillation. The abolition of the CR of the majority of BC parameters in the elderly suggests that human senescence is characterised by consistent changes in the daily rhythmic patterns of fat, water and electrolyte metabolism."

CD009647,0,9730110,0,Effects of hydration on tactile sensation.,"The routine tasks of washing usually necessitates the immersion of parts of the body in water, which causes hydration and changes in the mechanical properties of the superficial layer of skin. To determine how hydration affects tactile sensations, the hydration and skin-surface temperature of glabrous and hairy skin was first measured under normal conditions (air), after submersion in distilled water alone and after submersion in a surfactant-water solution. In these experiments, measurements were made of the time to achieve complete hydration and the recovery time to normal levels. The uptake of water in hairy skin was found to be considerably greater than in glabrous skin, and retention was significantly prolonged by the surfactant additive. Subsequent experiments on glabrous skin, based on the results of the preceding hydration studies, measured in-air and hydrated tactile thresholds and sensation magnitudes to vibratory stimuli and to the roughness of textured surfaces. Vibrotactile detection thresholds were not affected by skin hydration, nor were sensation magnitudes to suprathreshold vibratory stimuli. However, suprathreshold perceptions of roughness were substantially altered by hydration. It is concluded that hydration and the mechanics of the skin play a major role in the perception of spatiotemporal (i.e., textured) surfaces and, thus, must be taken into account in any physiological/psychophysical model based on using such stimuli. This may not be required for models based on predominantly temporal (i.e., vibratory) stimuli."

CD009647,0,9463788,0,Practical considerations and guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia.,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition which has a significant mortality. The management of a patient with CAP is centred around assessment and correction of gas exchange and fluid balance together with administration of appropriate antibiotics. Up to 10 different pathogens regularly cause CAP, of which Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most important. These different pathogens cannot be distinguished by clinical features or simple laboratory tests. Microbiological tests are slow and insensitive, so empirical therapy is necessary, at least initially. Accurate assessment of illness severity is the most important factor determining initial management, since this assists the decision of whether to admit the patient to hospital in addition to guiding antibiotic choice and route of administration. Two different approaches to severity assessment are outlined. Our antibiotic recommendation for empirical therapy for the patient managed at home and the previously fit patient admitted to hospital is amoxicillin. Amoxicillin/clavulanate plus a macrolide is our choice for the severely ill previously fit patient and a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide is recommended for the severely ill patient with comorbidity. Alternative pathogens and specific treatment regimens are also described. There may be several causes of treatment failure, and in patients who fail to respond to therapy, it is essential to review all the initial clinical and laboratory information, which if necessary must be repeated."

On the basis of the Starling's law, we postulated that elevation of plasma COP produced by infusion of serum albumin would result in the withdrawal of cerebral interstitial fluid. To test the hypothesis that an oncotic gradient would produce cerebral dehydration and result in reduction of intracranial pressure (ICP), we infused intravenously 25% solution of salt-poor human serum albumin, 2g/kg over 60 minutes for 10 patients with increased ICP. In these 10 patients, the degree of brain edema was not severe but mild to moderate by judging from CT scan findings. In addition to ICP, various parameters such as mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), central venous pressure (CVP), pulse rate, PaCO2 and urine volume were measured before, during and after albumin infusion. Hematological studies including COP, total protein, albumin-globulin ratio, protein fractions, hematocrit (Ht), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and electrolytes were also performed before, during and after administration of albumin. The raised ICP (27.4 +/- S.E. 1.6 mmHg) decreased significantly down to 19.1 (+/- 1.9) mmHg and remained stable for at least 240 minutes without any changes of MABP, pulse rate and PaCO2. CVP elevated significantly and remained at higher levels in comparison with control despite increase of urine output after administration of albumin. This results suggested that an adequate circulatory volume was maintained. A significant increase of total protein, serum albumin concentrations and albumin-globulin ratio was noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,1601352,0,Vomit identification by a pepsin assay using a fibrin blue-agarose gel plate.,"Reported is a simple and reliable method for identifying the presence of gastric fluid in forensic samples by an assay that reveals the pepsin activity. These samples are usually vomit found at the scene of a crime, either in fresh form or as a dried stain on clothing. The pepsin within the sample is assayed for its proteolytic activity which is revealed in a fibrin blue-agarose gel plate, as a result of an enzymatic reactivity that takes the form of a concentric, blue, translucent ring around the tested sample. Apart from being able to determine the pepsin content of fresh or recent forensic samples, this method has also achieved positive reactions in aged gastric fluid stains that were kept at room temperature. No body fluids other than the gastric fluid and no proteolytic enzymes other than pepsin show a positive reaction with the use of this method. This method has an additional advantage, in that the enzymatic activity seen on the gel plate can be photographed and the gel plate, on drying, can also be preserved as evidence."

CD009647,0,17620018,0,Role of arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists in hyponatremia in the elderly.,"Hyponatremia can occur at any age, but it is especially prevalent among the elderly, particularly those in acute care hospitals and long-term care facilities. The increased incidence in these patient groups is attributable to age-related impairment of fluid and electrolyte balance, use of multiple drugs that can precipitate hyponatremia, and increased vulnerability to diseases associated with hyponatremia. Recent evidence suggests that even mild chronic hyponatremia can have serious consequences in the elderly. Many current treatments for hyponatremia are limited by poor compliance, inconsistent or delayed response, or risk of adverse effects. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonists, a new class of drugs that block the binding of AVP to V2 receptors in the kidney's collecting tubules, may provide a safe and effective alternative."

CD009647,0,2485485,0,The lack of clinical value of laboratory parameters in predicting outcome in acute renal failure.,"In 55 patients with either the oliguric and nonoliguric form of acute renal failure, some laboratory parameters for the analysis of prerenal and intrinsic types of acute renal failure were examined. The parameters were analyzed within 7 days of the clinically known beginning of the illness. The parameters were analyzed as follows: sodium in urine, creatinine urine/plasma ratio, urine osmolality, osmolality urine/plasma ratio, renal failure index, and fractional excretion of filtered sodium. Hemodialysis was performed in 29 of the 55 patients. The oliguric form of acute renal failure was present in 49 of the 55 patients. In relation to renal failure index, prerenal acute renal failure was present in 7 patients and intrinsic acute renal failure in 48. It appears that in patients with a clinical diagnosis of prerenal acute renal failure, the urinary parameters do not separate them from those with acute tubular necrosis. It also appears that in patients with laboratory diagnosis of prerenal acute renal failure (i.e., a RFT less than 1.0), the response to treatment is unpredictable and in fact may have a worse prognosis than in those with a RFI greater than 1.0 (5/7 deaths vs 10/48 deaths)."
CD009647,0,7042360,0,Study of the possible interactions of indoprofen on the diuretic effect of furosemide.,"Twelve elderly in-patients undergoing chronic furosemide treatment (25 mg/day), with stable diuresis, were admitted to a cross-over, double-blind study to investigate the possible interactions between indoprofen and the diuretic. Indoprofen (200 mg t.i.d.) and identical placebo tablets were administered in randomized sequences for 4 days each. The sequence were preceded by a 4-day run-in observation period and followed by a 4-day follow-up. 24-hour urinary volume and the excretion of Na, K and endogenous creatinine were monitored, with serum Na, K, creatinine and creatinine clearance. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured and routine clinical blood chemistry tests and urinalysis were made for safety. The findings of this pilot study suggest that indoprofen does not alter the natriuretic action of furosemide; a tendency was noted towards a reduction of glomerular filtrate and urine volume, but the values after indoprofen were not significantly different from those after placebo."

Glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and maximal urinary concentration were also measured both before and after therapy with potassium chloride. While the plasma potassium concentration quickly returned to normal, total body content of potassium remained depressed, emphasizing the unreliability of the plasma potassium concentration as an indicator of total body potassium status. Parameters of renal function measured in this study, which were depressed by potassium depletion, also did not alter with correction of the plasma potassium level. This suggests that these functions are primarily affected by cellular potassium content."
CD009647,0,16732715,0,Therapeutic potential of angiotensin receptor blockers in hypertension.,"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a key role in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit angiotensin II type 1 receptors and large clinical trials have shown that they are effective in many cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction and diabetic nephropathy. They lower blood pressure effectively, are very well tolerated and can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other drug classes for the treatment of hypertension. ARBs are particularly suitable for hypertensive patients with co-morbidities such as diabetes, microalbuminuria, proteinuria, left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs do not cause persistent dry cough. For patients in whom angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated but not tolerated, an ARB should be considered. Periodic monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is required in patients treated with an ARB."

Before dialysis, total body water was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects comparable for height, sex, age and weight, while it was not possible to obtain direct data on the dimensions of the cell mass. After dialysis, total body water values normalised and the dimensions of the intracellular spaces and cell mass became almost comparable to those of the controls: data analysis shows that during treatment, weight loss occurs almost exclusively in the extracellular compartments of the organism. Notwithstanding the fact that the absolute values are similar to those of the controls, body composition did not normalise as relationships between the dimensions of the various sectors remain altered."

This study aims to evaluate some effects of synbiotic supplementation on inflammatory markers and the body composition of the elderly at risk of frailty. In a double-blind study that lasted three months, 17 elderly individuals fulfilling one frailty criteria (grip strength) were randomly distributed into two groups: SYN (n = 9), daily intake of synbiotic (6 g Frutooligossacarides, 108 to 109 CFU Lactobacillus paracasei, 108 to 109 CFU Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 108 to 109 CFU Lactobacillus acidophilus and 108 to 109 CFU Bifidobacterium lactis), or placebo (maltodextrin; PLA; n = 8). Subjects were analyzed for anthropometric measurements, bioelectric impedance with vectorial analysis (BIVA), IL-6 and TNF-α. A comparison between groups did not show any difference for the variables investigated. In turn, individual analysis of electrical impedance (BIVA) demonstrated that the majority of SYN individuals maintained or improved their tissue hydration, when compared to the PLA group after supplementation. In conclusion, three months of synbiotic supplementation did not promote any significant changes in inflammatory cytokines or body composition, but demonstrated a trend towards a preservation of hydration status in apparently healthy elderly individuals."
CD009647,0,16868354,0,A new model for the determination of fluid status and body composition from bioimpedance measurements.,"In patients with end stage renal failure, control of the fluid status of the body is lost and fluid accumulates continuously. By dialysis therapy, excess fluid can be removed, but there are no reliable methods to establish the amount of excess fluid to be removed. Severe and even lethal complications may be the consequence of longer term deviations from a normal fluid status in dialysis patients, but also in other patient groups. Therefore, a large medical need exists for a precise and pragmatic method to determine fluid status. Bioimpedance measurement, today mainly used for nutrition status assessment, is regarded as an interesting candidate method for fluid status determination. This paper presents a four-compartment model of the human body, developed to derive information on fluid status from extra- and intracellular volumes measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy. The model allows us to determine weights of each of four compartments (overhydration, fat, muscle and remaining 'basic' components) by analyzing extra- and intracellular water volumes in different tissues of the body. Thereby fluid status (overhydration volume, normohydrated weight of the patient) as well as nutrition and fitness status (lean body, fat and muscle mass) can be determined quantitatively from a single measurement. A preliminary evaluation of the performance of a system consisting of a bioimpedance spectrum analyzer and the four-compartment model is also provided."

It is characterized by changes in cellular membrane integrity and alterations in fluid balance, both of which can be detected by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). We investigated whether BIA-mesured variables could detect malnutrition, as defined by body mass index (BMI) and anthropometric indices, in 83 Tunisian cancer patients (18 men and 65 women) hospitalized in surgery. The investigations occurred within the first 24 hours following hospital admission. Analysis revealed that 4.8 % of the patients were at risk for malnutrition according to body mass index. By impedancemetry, 26.5 % of all patients had free-fat mass index (FFMI) below the normal range and 15.6 % had a low fat mass index (FMI) despite a normal or relatively high BMI. While males lose their fatty reserves early, females tend to lose free-fat, muscular mass regardless of their BMI. The BMI can be misleading in an overweight or obese patient and conceal losses in muscular mass in patients exposed to latent malnutrition. The FFMI and FMI appear to be better indicators of the nutritional status than the BMI."

To further clarify this issue, we compared changes in BIA-derived height(2)/resistance (ht(2)/R) with changes in total body water (deuterium dilution, delta-TBWdeu) in cancer patients participating in a clinical trial. Thirty-three patients (mean body mass index 23.2 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2)) were studied after an average follow-up of 11 weeks. Changes in TBWdeu occurred in both directions (mean +0.2 +/- 1.6 L, range -3.3 to +3.1 L). These changes were significantly predicted by changes in ht(2)/R (r(2)0.43, P < 0.0001, SEE 1.22 L), although precision was poor (residual SD 1. 2 L). There were in this regard no significant differences between patients with and without underweight. We conclude that in underweight and normal-weight cancer patients, BIA-derived changes in ht(2)/R significantly predict changes in total body water assessed by deuterium dilution."
CD009647,0,6616994,0,The effect of undernutrition and disease site and stage on cell-mediated immunity in gastrointestinal cancer.,"In order to assess whether impairment of cell-mediated immunity in cancer was due to the presence, site and stage of malignant disease or to associated undernourishment, 48 patients with gastrointestinal cancer were compared to 27 patients with benign gastrointestinal disease. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) was assessed by delayed hypersensitivity (DHS) skin test response to recall antigens and lymphocyte mitogenic response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). Patients were grouped according to nutritional status assessed from a history of weight loss and changes in the ratio of total body potassium (TBK mmol) to total body water (TBW kg). The results showed that, whilst cancer patients as a whole had significantly worse DHS response, there were no significant differences between benign and malignant groups of equivalent nutritional status and in both types of disease response decreased significantly with worsening nutritional status (chi 2(2) = 6.83 cancer, 6.11 benign, p less than 0.05). PHA response was significantly worse in the worst nourished cancer patients than in those with normal nutritional status (p less than 0.05, Wilcoxon). Disease site and stage had no significant effect on either test. The results suggest that depression of CMI response in gastrointestinal cancer is due to undernutrition and is not a cancer specific effect."
CD009647,0,17278780,0,[The leptin concentration in patients with primary arterial hypertension].,"Leptin seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension by activation of the sympathetic nervous system, influencing water - electrolyte balance and vascular remodeling. It is not known whether leptin is a factor participating in the pathogenesis of primary arterial hypertension or its higher concentration in patients with arterial hypertension reflects only the presence of other factors leading to increased blood pressure. The aim of the study was to try to estimate the leptin participation in the development of the arterial hypertension, to evaluate the concentration of leptin in blood serum of patients with mild, moderate and severe arterial hypertension and to determine the relationships between the observed leptin concentration, arterial hypertension degree according to WHO criteria and body mass. The investigations were performed on 74 untreated patients aged 19-74 years (mean 47 +/- 12 years ). In this group there were 33 women aged 35-74 years (mean 51 +/- 10 years) and 41 men aged 19-73 years (mean 45 +/- 14 years). The mild arterial hypertension was observed in 24 patients, moderate hypertension in 34 patients and severe hypertension in 16. The obesity, identified when BMI was equal or higher than 30 kg/m2, was observed in 4 patients with mild hypertension, in 9 with moderate hypertension and in 6 with severe hypertension. All patients had normal renal function. The leptin concentration was determined by the radioimmunological method using the Human Leptin RIA Kit by LINCO Research, Inc. (Cat# HL-81 K). The analysis of the obtained results was performed using Statistica for Windows PL.V5.0."
CD009647,0,11980089,0,Preoperative hyponatremia as a clinical characteristic in elderly patients with large pituitary tumor.,"This study investigated the pathophysiology of preoperative hyponatremia in elderly patients with a large pituitary tumor. The tumor size, initial symptoms, and preoperative pituitary hormonal function were analyzed in 96 patients, consisting of 82 younger than 70 years old (mean age 49.7 years) and 14 older than 70 years old (mean age 72.0 years). There was no difference in tumor size between the two age groups. The initial symptom of all younger patients was visual disturbance. Preoperative hormonal evaluations revealed subclinical panhypopituitarism in four patients (4.9%). Five of the 14 older patients had severe hyponatremia (107-117 mEq/l) based on panhypopituitarism, and four of these five patients showed consciousness disturbance as the initial symptom, initiated by physical and/or psychological stress, or occurrence of intratumoral hemorrhage. Preoperative subclinical panhypopituitarism was found in another patient. The overall occurrence rate of preoperative panhypopituitarism in the older patients was 42.9%. The difference in the frequency of preoperative panhypopituitarism was statistically significant between the two groups. Preoperative severe hyponatremia associated with a large pituitary tumor is characteristic of elderly patients. The number of receptors for adrenocorticotropic hormone in the adrenal cortex decreases during the aging process. Additional physical and/or psychological stress prompts pituitary dysfunction in such patients, causing the manifestation of acute symptoms of adrenal insufficiency based on panhypopituitarism. Primary care using high dose hydrocortisone and electrolyte fluid is critical."

Subjects treated with OTC moisturizer or sodium sulfacetamide exhibited decreased water loss, increased water retention, similar or improved levels of skin hydration, and decreased desorption rates. In contrast, subjects treated with jar or tube clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide had increased water loss, decreased water retention, decreased hydration, and increased desorption rates. Skin dryness decreased slightly in the moisturizer group. No serious adverse events occurred. Overall, the OTC moisturizer had the best skin hydration profile. Sodium sulfacetamide demonstrated some moisturizing characteristics, and no clinically relevant differences were noted between jar and tube clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gels."

CD009647,0,20353442,0,Effect of a selective neutrophil elastase inhibitor on early recovery from body water imbalance after transthoracic esophagectomy.,"The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of sivelestat, a selective neutrophil elastase inhibitor, on body fluid balance after transthoracic esophagectomy. Esophagectomy with elective lymphadenectomy may induce excessive release of neutrophil elastase, which then promotes vascular permeability and an excessive water shift from the intravascular space to the peripheral compartment. Body fluid imbalance after esophagectomy often leads to circular instability, a decrease of urine output, and a delay in the shift to a diuretic state. The study was designed as a case-control study with a historical control group. A retrospective analysis was performed to examine our hypothesis that sivelestat improves abnormal body fluid retention and prevents subsequent pulmonary complications. To reveal the direct influence of sivelestat on the postoperative course, we avoided using steroids or other diuretic agents. Eighty-eight patients who underwent thoracic esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy from 2000 to 2008 were divided into two groups: those treated from 2003 to 2008, who all received postoperative administration of sivelestat (n=60); and those treated from 2000 to 2002, who did not receive sivelestat and were used as the control group (n=28). Both groups received fluid management using the same protocol. The time to reach a diuretic state, time until extubation of the tracheal tube, and development of delayed respiratory dysfunction were compared between the groups using univariate and multivariate analysis. The time until a shift to a diuretic state was significantly shorter after treatment with sivelestat (p<0.0001) and with a shorter operation time (p<0.0001). The tracheal tube was extubated significantly earlier in the sivelestat group (p<0.0001) and the incidence of delayed respiratory dysfunction was also significantly lower (p=0.0028) in this group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a delay in a shift to a diuretic state was a strong independent risk factor for the time to tracheal extubation (odds ratio 2.539, p=0.0056) and occurrence of delayed respiratory dysfunction (odds ratio 1.989, p=0.0104). Sivelestat treatment was not independently associated with reduced pulmonary complications, but the diuretic state was strongly regulated by sivelestat treatment (odds ratio 0.044, p=0.0003). Thus, administration of sivelestat has a beneficial influence on recovery from body water imbalance through a more rapid return to a diuretic state after esophagectomy, which contributes to prevention of subsequent pulmonary complications."

In the presence of RRF, maintenance of an adequate fluid balance is facilitated, level of systemic inflammation is lower, and renal endocrine functions are preserved. The beneficial impact of RRF also may be related to the preservation of specific renal elimination mechanisms, such as tubular metabolism or secretion, which are crucial for the removal of some uremic retention solutes."

CD009647,0,2104581,0,Peritoneal dialysis for acute renal failure: overfeeding resulting from dextrose absorbed during dialysis.,"Peritoneal dialysis is a relatively safe and effective form of therapy for acute renal failure (ARF). As dextrose in the dialysate provides the osmotic gradient to achieve fluid removal, frequent exchanges with dialysate containing high dextrose is occasionally used to achieve negative balance in fluid overloaded patients. It has previously been shown that dextrose absorption from the peritoneal cavity is significant. Using indirect calorimetry and analyzing the dialysate effluent for its dextrose concentration, we studied the effects of high dextrose-containing dialysate in five patients with ARF. Despite minimal intake of calories, all patients had an RQ greater than 1.0 consistent with net lipogenesis resulting from dextrose absorbed from the peritoneal cavity. Four of five patients absorbed greater than 500 g of dextrose over 24 h. As overfeeding could lead to hepatic steatosis, increased CO2 production with worsening of respiratory failure, and hyperglycemia, the risks of using high dextrose-containing dialysate fluids should be weighed carefully against potential benefits. When nutritional support is indicated in such patients, contribution of dextrose calories from dialysate fluid should be taken into account."

Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, vasopressin, aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and plasma renin activity were measured before, immediately after, and 30 minutes and 18 to 24 hours following balloon inflation in 18 patients. Mean right atrial and pulmonary wedge pressures were 6 and 18 mm Hg before inflations, respectively, and were unchanged after balloon inflations (5 and 13 mm Hg, respectively). Systemic systolic/diastolic pressures were 139 +/- 8/65 +/- 4 mm Hg before occlusion, decreased to 47 +/- 5/34 +/- 3 mm Hg during occlusion, and returned to baseline after occlusions. Baseline atrial natriuretic peptide levels were 267 +/- 43 pg/ml and increased to 513 +/- 71 pg/ml after balloon inflations. Vasopressin levels before occlusion were 9.1 +/- 2.2 pg/ml and increased to 21.4 +/- 4.8 pg/ml after balloon inflations. Plasma renin activity was 5.4 +/- 1.4 ng/ml/hr before inflations and was not significantly changed after balloon inflations. No clinically significant changes in plasma sodium, potassium, creatinine, and osmolality were observed after the procedure. Aldosterone increased from 23 +/- 4 to 40 +/- 7 ng/dl 10 minutes after the last inflation. Plasma ACTH measured in seven patients with increased aldosterone was 28 +/- 8 pg/ml before and increased to 295 +/- 157 pg/ml 10 minutes after balloon inflations. The increases in natriuretic peptide and vasopressin were likely due to elevated intracardiac and decreased arterial pressures, respectively; they persisted in spite of no clinically significant changes in filling pressures 12 to 24 hours after the procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Patients with RO are not usually treated, but recent awareness that symptoms are associated with mild hyponatremia creates a therapeutic dilemma. We encountered patients with hyponatremia, hypouricemia and high urine sodium concentration (UNa), who had normal fractional excretion (FE) of urate and excreted dilute urines that were consistent with RO. We decided to test whether a normal FEurate in nonedematous hyponatremia irrespective of UNa or serum urate would identify patients with RO."

A preliminary report.,"Chronic cervical spinal cord injury is characterized by defects in sodium and water homeostasis and defects of adaptive hormonal responses. The plasma osmolality is maintained in a relatively narrow range, the lower limit of which is determined by osmotic threshold for vasopressin release and the upper limit by the third threshold. Antidiuretic hormone as an important mediator of fluid and electrolyte balance was well investigated in able bodied children comparing children with normal voiding pattern and children with enuresis. The normal subjects were found to have higher plasma ADH at night, not detected in the group with enuresis. The findings were similar in elderly patients with increased diuresis at night, suggesting an important role of ADH in nocturnal decrease of urine output. Investigators studied the effect of rapid tilt on plasma ADH in tetraplegic compared with normal subjects, but there are no data available in the literature regarding ADH and its effects on water and electrolyte balance in healthy tetraplegic subjects with a normal lifestyle. We decided to undertake a pilot study to attempt to establish baseline ADH levels in this subject group, to better understand and manage tetraplegic patients with water and electrolyte dysregulation. Our preliminary data suggest that these individuals lack the normal diurnal variation of ADH, a phenomenon similar to that demonstrated in enuretic children and elderly, and furthermore appear to have generally depressed ADH levels."

Seven with incomplete or ambiguous data were excluded; of the remaining 97 patients, 31 were greater than or equal to 65 years old. Nine patients suffered systemic lupus erythematosus, 45 suffered brain ischemia, and 43 suffered other nonischemic neurologic disorders. Cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and cardiac valvulopathy were grounds for exclusion. The presence of anticardiolipin antibodies was not influenced by age. In the 88 patients without lupus, anticardiolipin antibodies were significantly more common in the group suffering brain ischemia than in the group with nonischemic neurologic disorders (29% versus 5%, p less than 0.01, chi 2 test). These controlled data demonstrate an association between the presence of circulating anticardiolipin antibodies with stroke, but not with other neurologic conditions."

Urine volume, free water clearance and plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II and aldosterone before and after oral water loading in hypertensive and normotensive renal transplant recipients.","Urine volume (V), free water clearance (CH2O) and plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin (AVP), angiotensin II (A II) and aldosterone (Aldo) were determined before and three times during the first 5 h after an oral water load of 20 ml/kg body wt in 19 patients with post-renal-transplant hypertension (group I), in 13 normotensive renal transplant recipients (group II) and in 20 control subjects (group III). Both V and CH2O increased significantly in all groups, but considerably less in groups I and II than in group III. When CH2O was related to glomerular filtration rate no differences existed between patients and control subjects. Basal AVP was the same in groups I (3.3 pmol/l, median) and II (3.0 pmol/l), but significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than in group III (1.9 pmol/l). Basal A II was significantly (p less than 0.01) elevated in group I (18 pmol/l) when compared to both groups II (10 pmol/l) and III (11 pmol/l), and the level was independent of the presence of native kidneys. Basal Aldo was the same in all groups. During loading, AVP was reduced in all groups, A II was almost unchanged, and Aldo was increased in groups I and II and reduced in group III depending on alterations in serum potassium. Thus urinary diluting ability is reduced in renal transplant recipients due to a reduced glomerular filtration rate. The enhanced A II in hypertensive renal transplant recipients gives further evidence for the point of view that hypertension is angiotensin-dependent in most of these patients."

CD009647,0,19454560,0,Cardiopulmonary bypass management and acute renal failure: risk factors and prognosis.,"The aim of the study was to investigate if acute renal failure (ARF) following cardiac surgery is influenced by CPB perfusion pressure and to determine risk factors of ARF. Our research consisted of two studies. In the first study, 179 adult patients with normal preoperative renal function who had been subjected to cardiac surgery on CPB were randomized into three groups. The mean perfusion pressure (PP) during CPB in Group 65 (68 patients) was 60-69.9 mmHg, in Group 55 (59 patients) -- lower than 60 mmHg and in Group 75 (52 patients) -- 70 mmHg and higher. We have analyzed postoperative variables: central venous pressure, the need for diuretics, urine output, fluid balance, acidosis, potassium level in blood serum, the need for hemotransfusions, nephrological, cardiovascular and respiratory complications, duration of artificial lung ventilation, duration of stay in ICU and in hospital, and mortality. In the second study, to identify the risk factors for the development of ARF following CPB, we retrospectively analysed data of all 179 patients, divided into two groups: patients who developed ARF after surgery (group with ARF, n = 19) and patients without ARF (group without ARF, n = 160). We found that urine output during surgery was statistically significantly lower in Group 55 than in Groups 65 and 75. The incidence of ARF in the early postoperative period did not differ among the groups: it developed in 6% of all patients in Group 65, 4% in Group 55 and 6% in Group 75. There were no differences in the rate of other complications (cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological disorders, bleeding, etc) among the groups. There were 19 cases of ARF (10.6%), but none of these patients needed dialysis. We found that age (70.0 +/- 7.51 vs. 63.5 +/- 10.54 [standard deviation, SD], P = 0.016), valve replacement and/or reconstruction surgery (57.9% vs. 27.2%, P = 0,011), combined valve and CABG surgery (15.8% vs. 1.4%, P = 0.004), duration of CPB (134.74 +/- 62.02 vs. 100.59 +/- 43.99 min., P = 0.003) and duration of aortic cross-clamp (75.11 +/- 35.78 vs. 53.45 +/- 24.19 min., P = 0.001) were the most important independent risk factors for ARF. Cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion pressure did not cause postoperative renal failure. The age of patient, valve surgery procedures, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and duration of aorta cross-clamp are potential causative factors for acute renal failure after cardiac surgery."
CD009647,0,9298408,0,Detection of hydration status by total body bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in patients on hemodialysis.,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether total body bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) could be appropriate to assess normohydration (i.e. dry weight) in hemodialysis patients. This study is warranted, because the simultaneous assessment of both hydration and nutritional status by BIA requires the presence of a situation of normohydration in order to guarantee valid conclusions about the nutritional analysis. Segmental bioelectrical impedance was performed to classify patients according to their hydration status. BIA measurements revealed significant differences in TBW, ECW and ICW/ECW between three hydration subgroups (under-, normo-, and overhydration), whereas ICW was similar. Therefore, TBW, ECW and ICW/ECW appear appropriate variables to assess hydration status in patients on hemodialysis. Hemodialysis diminished ECW significantly, whereas ICW did not change, suggesting that a decrease of ECW explains the fluid loss during hemodialysis."
CD009647,0,20038754,0,Relative plasma volume monitoring during hemodialysis AIDS the assessment of dry weight.,"Among hemodialysis patients, the assessment of dry weight remains a matter of clinical judgment because tests to assess dry weight have not been validated. The objective of this study was to evaluate and validate relative plasma volume (RPV) monitoring as a marker of dry weight. We performed RPV monitoring using the Crit-Line monitor at baseline and at 8 weeks in 150 patients participating in the Dry-Weight Reduction in Hypertensive Hemodialysis Patients Trial. The intervention group of 100 patients had dry weight probed, whereas 50 patients served as time controls. RPV slopes were defined as flat when they were less than the median (1.33% per hour) at the baseline visit. Among predominantly (87%) black hemodialysis patients, we found that flat RPV slopes suggest a volume-overloaded state for the following reasons: (1) probing dry weight in these patients led to steeper slopes; (2) those with flatter slopes at baseline had greater weight loss; (3) both baseline RPV slopes and the intensity of weight loss were found to be important for subsequent change in RPV slopes; and, most importantly, (4) RPV slopes predicted the subsequent reduction in interdialytic ambulatory systolic blood pressure. Those with the flattest slopes had the greatest decline in blood pressure on probing dry weight. Both baseline RPV slopes and the change in RPV slopes were important for subsequent changes in ambulatory systolic blood pressure. We conclude that RPV slope monitoring is a valid method to assess dry weight among hypertensive hemodialysis patients."

CD009647,0,7606877,0,Molecular forms of human brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in plasma of patients on hemodialysis (HD).,"Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have been reported to increase in patients with heart failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD); however, little is known about molecular forms of plasma BNP that increase in these diseases. In the present study, we analyzed the molecular forms of plasma BNP in ESRD patients of both before (pre-) and after (post-) hemodialysis (HD) state. The plasma extract was analyzed by gel filtration on a TSK-GEL G2000 SW column followed by a RIA for both BNP and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In the pre-HD patients, a 14- to 2300-fold increase in plasma level of immunoreactive (ir-) BNP was observed when compared to normal controls. A ratio of BNP-32 to g-BNP (pro BNP) in plasma from the patients was much larger than that in plasma from normal subjects, indicating that the high plasma level of ir-BNP level in the patients on HD largely results from a marked increase in BNP-32. HD significantly (P < 0.01) lowered the plasma levels of both BNP-32 and g-BNP with a greater reduction in BNP-32 than in g-BNP. Whereas, a-ANP was a main molecular form of plasma ANP in both pre- and post-HD plasma. These results suggest that plasma BNP-32 plays an important role in the sodium-fluid balance and that secretion and metabolism of BNP may differ from those of ANP in the HD patients."

We investigated renal elimination of leptin by comparing plasma leptin concentrations in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with normal controls. Our hypothesis was that if renal filtration is a significant route of elimination, the hormone would accumulate in ESRD patients. Mean plasma levels in 141 ESRD patients (26.8 +/- 5.7 and 38.3 +/- 5.6 micrograms/L for males and females, respectively) were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than mean values obtained in normal controls (11.9 +/- 3.1 and 21.2 +/- 3.0 micrograms/L for males and females, respectively). Leptin concentrations in ESRD patients correlated directly with body mass index (BMI; r = 0.77 for men and 0.78 for women). The rate of increase in leptin concentrations with BMI was significantly greater in ESRD patients (5.5 and 6.6 micrograms/L/U BMI for men and women, respectively) than in normal controls (1.4 and 2.6 micrograms/L/U for men and women, respectively). Pre- and postdialysis leptin levels in hemodialysis patients were similar. Western blot of plasma from ESRD patients with high leptin levels showed bands corresponding to the intact protein (16 kDa) with no lesser or greater molecular mass species observed. Leptin concentrations in patients with ESRD did not correlate with measures of residual renal function (serum creatinine, beta 2-microglobulin, PTH, or GH levels). Similarly, we found no correlation between leptin levels and the number of years patients had been on dialysis or with recent weight changes. We conclude that intact leptin is increased in ESRD patients, but does not appear to cause decreased weight. As leptin levels did not correlate with residual renal function, increased production may account for the high levels observed."

CD009647,0,11190297,0,[Hypertension and primary hyperaldosteronism].,"Hypokalaemic hypertension or resistant hypertension justify investigation for primary hyperaldosteronism. The first step of this investigation is to exclude the ingestion of liquorice, alkalis and diuretics. The second is to make sure that the treatment is compatible with the hormonal tests and that the natriuresis and kaliuresis are normal. The diagnosis then depends on an increased plasma or urinary concentration of aldosterone with a low plasma renin activity. The adenoma of Conn is present in 2/3 of cases and surgically curable, and should be distinguished from adrenal hyperplasia which is treatable with distal diuretics. This is a diagnosis which requires computerised tomography or, when inconclusive, demonstration of unilateral secretion of aldosterone. Adrenalectomy, usually by coelioscopy, is indicated in Conn's adenoma when the patient is young and the hypertension severe or recent.

Blood pressure was well controlled following both monotherapy or combination therapy. Plasma renin activity was stimulated in all subjects; plasma aldosterone concentration was stimulated only in subjects receiving combination therapy. Glomerular filtration rate (assessed by inulin clearance) was unchanged in subjects with initial clearances greater than 80 ml/min/1.73 m2 but was significantly improved (55%) following either form of therapy in subjects with initial clearances less than or equal to 80 ml/min/1.73 m2. Neither monotherapy nor combination therapy adversely affected 24-hour urinary protein excretion, sodium excretion, or body fluid composition. These results suggest that enalapril, either alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, is effective therapy for mild to moderate hypertension. There are no adverse effect on renal function; indeed, enalapril has the capability of improving renal function in those subjects whose renal function was initially impaired from long-standing hypertension."

Severity of the circulatory defect characterized by hypotension, reduced cardiac output, oliguria, and notably reduced skin (toe) temperature before treatment with dopamine was not directly related to survival. However, the arterial blood concentration of lactate before treatment with dopamine indicated the likelihood of survival. Patients who ultimately survived following treatment with dopamine had normal or only mildly elevated levels of arterial blood lactate before therapy. No patients with established shock states in whom perfusion failure was associated with substantial increases in the level of arterial blood lactate survived regardless of treatment with dopamine. Increases in toe temperature during dopamine treatment also emerged as a uniquely good indicator of favorable outcome during therapy."

During one 5-d sequence, the subjects replaced fluid losses with a glucose-electrolyte solution, while water was the only fluid ingested during a second 5-d series. With the exception of the drink, daily ionic and caloric intakes were identical for the two 5-d conditions. Measurements of water and electrolyte losses in sweat and urine showed a positive balance in body Na+, K+, and Cl- during both the water (W) and electrolyte solution (ES) treatments. Subjects accumulated significantly more Na+ during the W experiments (392 mEq/5 d) than when the electrolyte solution was ingested (334 mEq/5 d). As a result, the extracellular fluid compartment, represented by plasma volume, increased 12.2 and 9.0% during the 5-d sequence of the W and ES trials, respectively. It was concluded that the addition of electrolytes to drinking water is of minimal value for subjects who dehydrated (-3%) on repeated days and are permitted to ingest food and drink libitum"
CD009647,0,3568579,0,Transthoracic electrical impedance at 1 and 100 kHz--a means for separating thoracic fluid compartments?,"The electrical impedance of biological tissues varies with their water and electrolyte contents. Alternating current above 5-10 kHz passes both intra- and extracellular fluid, and lower frequency current preferentially extracellular fluid. In an attempt to evaluate thoracic fluid in different compartments, transthoracic electrical impedance (TEI) was measured at 1 and 100 kHz in 15 consecutive patients, without overt left heart failure and under haemodynamic surveillance, during the first two days of myocardial infarction. To achieve different states of hydration the patients were given i.v. furosemide, either 40 mg t.i.d. (high dose group--HDG) or 20 mg once daily (low dose group--LDG). Effects of altered body position and the respective furosemide injections, were evaluated on both days. Mean 24-h-diuresis was 3.9 l in the HDG and 2.5 l in the LDG. After 24 h mean pulmonary arterial diastolic pressure had decreased by 30% in the HDG but remained almost unchanged in the LDG. By then mean basal TEI was increased only in the HDG, by 17% at 1 kHz and 13% at 100 kHz. On Day 1, within one hour after furosemide, TEI increased temporarily by 3-5%, at both frequencies and in both groups. On Day 2, this short-term increase was similar in the LDG at both frequencies and in the HDG at 100 kHz, but not at 1 kHz, consistent with a major extracellular fluid loss in the HDG. TEI at 1 and 100 kHz may thus reflect extracellular and total thoracic fluid, respectively."
CD009647,0,2588995,0,Influence of the fluid balance on the cortisol and glucose responses to transurethral prostatic surgery.,"The serum cortisol and blood glucose concentrations were followed for up to 2 h after 35 transurethral prostatic resections performed under epidural anaesthesia. No significant variation in either of these levels was recorded in connection with the seven operations during which there was no disturbance of the fluid balance, or the seven where there was elevation in the central venous pressure indicative of intravenous fluid overload. In contrast, both the serum cortisol and the blood glucose level showed a significant increase in the nine patients with a blood loss of more than 800 ml, and in the nine recording absorption of irrigant in excess of 300 ml and immediate development of hyponatraemia. On the other hand, this response did not occur in the three patients with irrigant absorption where hyponatraemia developed with a delay of at least 20 min. These results suggest that the effect of surgery on the serum cortisol and blood glucose levels may be modified by disturbances of the fluid balance developing in the course of the operation."

CD009647,0,7930879,0,Characteristics of vasopressin release during controlled reduction in arterial pressure.,"Because of the interruption of the descending sympathetic nervous pathways, individuals with cervical spinal cord injury experience orthostatic hypotension when in an upright posture. The changes in hemodynamic parameters that occur during upright posture can be closely monitored and quantitated during progressive head-up tilting on a tilt table. We have utilized this method to assess the response of vasopressin and other vasoactive hormones to gradual, progressive reductions in arterial pressure and to identify possible threshold responses to baroreceptor stimulation in human subjects. Studies were performed in 12 quadriplegic subjects, 3 paraplegic subjects, and 3 normal control subjects. Data from the studies in paraplegic and normal subjects did not differ and were pooled as control data. In quadriplegic subjects, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased from 93 +/- 4 mm Hg to 60 +/- 3 mm Hg in a closely correlated (r = 0.948, p < 0.002) linear relationship with increasing degrees of tilt, whereas in control subjects, MAP increased from 81 +/- 4 to 88 +/- 3 mm Hg. Plasma vasopressin concentrations (Pavp) increased minimally in quadriplegic subjects until MAP was reduced to levels that were 25% to 30% lower than MAP with subjects in the supine posture. Beyond this level of hypotension, Pavp increased markedly. Log-linear regression analysis of these data showed a highly significant correlation (r = 0.85, p < 0.0002) between in Pavp and MAP, which defines Pavp as an exponential function of decreasing MAP. Changes in Pavp in control subjects were minimal during incremental head-up tilting. In contrast, plasma renin activity (PRA) increased in both quadriplegic and control subjects. Log-linear regression analysis of these data showed highly significant correlates between in PRA and degree of tilt in both quadriplegic (r = 0.958, p < 0.0002) and control (r = 0.873, p < 0.0002) subjects. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations decreased linearly with increasing degrees of tilt. The rate of decline in Panp was greater in quadriplegic than in control subjects. These studies provide additional evidence that Pavp increases exponentially as a function of decreasing MAP and suggest that a critical threshold level of hypotension exists at which vasopressin release accelerates rapidly in response to baroreceptor stimulation. At this level of reduced MAP, Pavp reaches levels that are potentially capable of exerting a pressor effect."

CD009647,0,17293202,0,Intrathoracic impedance monitoring to predict decompensated heart failure.,"Intrathoracic impedance measurement has been introduced in the InSync Sentry biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and may permit the early identification of pulmonary fluid accumulation secondary to left-sided heart failure (HF). An audible alarm (the OptiVol alert) can be triggered when the impedance index increases to greater than a predefined level of 60 Omega . day. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of the OptiVol alert and its prediction for decompensated HF. One hundred fifteen consecutive patients (mean New York Heart Association class 2.8 +/- 0.5, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 26 +/- 8%) who received InSync Sentry biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillators were included. When presenting with the OptiVol alert, current hemodynamic status was evaluated. During follow-up (mean 9 +/- 5 months), there were 45 presentations with the OptiVol alert in 30 patients. Clinical signs and symptoms of HF were present in only 15 patients (33%), whereas in the remaining patients, clinical signs of HF were absent (p <0.05). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that increasing the threshold for the OptiVol alert provided a substantial increase in specificity for the detection of HF, with the optimal cut-off value identified at 120 Omega . day, yielding sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 73%. In conclusion, intrathoracic impedance measurement as present in the InSync Sentry biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator may be a useful tool for monitoring pulmonary fluid status. The proposed threshold for the OptiVol alert of 60 Omega. day is very sensitive but not specific for the assessment of HF; adjustment of threshold settings may yield a superior balance between sensitivity and specificity."

CD009647,0,3712972,0,Transcapillary colloid osmotic gradient and body fluid volumes in renal failure.,"The aim was to study the transcapillary fluid balance in dialysis patients during and after ultrafiltration. Plasma and subcutaneous interstitial fluid (wick technique) colloid osmotic pressure, plasma volume (I125-albumin space) and extracellular fluid volume (radiosulfate space) were measured in nine patients on maintenance hemodialysis before (pre-dialysis state) and after (dry-weight state) ultrafiltration. In the pre-dialysis state, interstitial colloid osmotic pressure was reduced compared to normal controls (12.7 +/- 3.5 versus 15.8 +/- 2.7 mmHg, mean values +/- SD) and transcapillary colloid osmotic gradient increased (15.3 +/- 3.0 versus 12.8 +/- 2.7 mmHg). Ultrafiltration resulted in a parallel decrease of plasma volume and interstitial fluid volume of 19 to 20%, and an increase in mean interstitial colloid osmotic pressure of 3.4 mmHg and in mean transcapillary colloid osmotic gradient of 1.9 mmHg. The mean ultrafiltration rate was 21.9 +/- 1.9 ml/min and the plasma refilling rate was 16.5 +/- 2.7 ml/min. It is concluded that the changes in plasma and interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure tend to preserve plasma volume and limit the interdialytic increase in interstitial fluid volume."
CD009647,0,18519109,0,Understanding clinical dehydration and its treatment.,"Dehydration in clinical practice, as opposed to a physiological definition, refers to the loss of body water, with or without salt, at a rate greater than the body can replace it. We argue that the clinical definition for dehydration, ie, loss of total body water, addresses the medical needs of the patient most effectively. There are 2 types of dehydration, namely water loss dehydration (hyperosmolar, due either to increased sodium or glucose) and salt and water loss dehydration (hyponatremia). The diagnosis requires an appraisal of the patient and laboratory testing, clinical assessment, and knowledge of the patient's history. Long-term care facilities are reluctant to have practitioners make a diagnosis, in part because dehydration is a sentinel event thought to reflect poor care. Facilities should have an interdisciplinary educational focus on the prevention of dehydration in view of the poor outcomes associated with its development. We also argue that dehydration is rarely due to neglect from formal or informal caregivers, but rather results from a combination of physiological and disease processes. With the availability of recombinant hyaluronidase, subcutaneous infusion of fluids (hypodermoclysis) provides a better opportunity to treat mild to moderate dehydration in the nursing home and at home."
CD009647,0,14498755,0,Dual ACE and neutral endopeptidase inhibitors: novel therapy for patients with cardiovascular disorders.,"Elevated blood pressure is a risk factor for a variety of cardiovascular disorders, including coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, cardiac failure and cerebrovascular disease. The prevailing view is that an elevated systolic rather than diastolic blood pressure is the major contributor in mortality and morbidity attributed to cardiovascular disorders. Isolated high systolic blood pressure, especially in the elderly, is a major risk factor and should undoubtedly be a target for drug treatment. In the general population, systolic and diastolic blood pressure are highly correlated, and thus it is difficult to dissociate the effects of these two components of the blood pressure and specifically ascribe cardiovascular risk factors to just elevated systolic blood pressure. Therefore, the goal in therapy of an individual with hypertension must be to reduce elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure in order to reduce mortality and morbidity. ACE and neutral peptidase inhibitors are a new class of drugs that may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with hypertension and heart failure. They may also be useful in the treatment of diabetic patients with hypertension and/or heart failure. Drugs of this class are dual inhibitors of ACE and neutral endopeptidase, and are capable of affecting vascular tone and fluid balance. They are capable of producing vasodilatation by virtue of inhibiting the production of angiotensin II, degradation of natriuretic peptides and bradykinin. They also appear to promote natriuresis and diuresis by amplifying the actions of natriuretic peptidase and reducing aldosterone effects. In addition, they should also attenuate trophogenic actions of the renin angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system. Omapatrilat is one drug that appears to be at the advanced stages of clinical development. This drug has been shown to be quite effective in the treatment of hypertension. Evidence also seems to indicate that treatment with omapatrilat results in a higher tendency towards preventing death and worsening heart failure when compared with treatment with a pure ACE inhibitor in patients with advanced heart failure. Overall safety with omapatrilat appears to be good, but like other ACE inhibitors the incidence of cough is higher when compared with placebo. Other common adverse effects noted are headaches, facial flushing/warm sensation, dizziness, nausea and dyspnoea. Of greater concern is the occurrence of angio-oedema, the true incidence of which remains to be fully established as part of the published medical literature."

CD009647,0,3087320,0,[Antiarrhythmic effects of intravenous magnesium sulfate in torsade de pointes. Apropos of 6 cases].,"The antiarrhythmic properties of magnesium salts, known for many years, are periodically recalled but rarely used in daily clinical practice. They are usually used in digitalis-induced arrhythmias and are rarely indicated in other conditions; they are often reserved for cases in which a magnesium deficiency is suspected. In 6 cases of torsades de pointes, magnesium sulphate was administered at a dose 1 to 3 g by direct intravenous injection. Although hypokalaemia was a common finding, a low magnesium concentration was only found in one case. The ventricular arrhythmia regressed completely at the end of the injection in 4 cases (one after two injections). One positive but incomplete response was observed in the only case of magnesium deficiency, probably due in retrospect to inadequate dosage. Finally, one patient with very poor ventricular function had recurrence after a good initial response. The diversity of the clinical and biological findings in this series suggests a specific antiarrhythmic action of the magnesium ion, apparently independant of the correction of magnesium deficiency; experimental studies suggest that the mode of action is a direct antagonism of Mg++-K+ and/or Mg++-Ca++. Compared to usual means of treatment of torsades de pointes (isoprenaline infusion or pacing) the advantages of intravenous magnesium sulphate are clear-cut: innocuity, simplicity and rapidity of administration, and almost immediate efficacy."

CD009647,0,11730240,0,Physical activity and parameters of aging: a physiological perspective.,"Increasing age is associated with a decline in fat-free mass. The question is whether age-related changes in body composition can be delayed by an active life style. This analysis includes data where physical activity was assessed with doubly labeled water and body composition with hydrodensitometry or isotope dilution. Subjects were 136 women and 180 men over 20 years, who were tested in Maastricht University between 1983 and 1998. Increasing age was associated with lower activity levels and lower fat-free mass. After controlling for age there was no longer any association between physical activity and fat-free mass. A few exercise intervention studies showed that elderly subjects compensate for exercise training by a decline in spontaneous physical activity, in contrast to younger subjects. Although no effect of habitual activity level on changes in body composition are observed, training has a positive effect on muscle function. Elderly subjects with relatively high levels of physical activity are not different from those with low activity levels, as far as fat-free mass and fat mass are concerned. However, training might delay the age-induced impairment of personal mobility associated with a reduction in physical activity."
CD009647,0,12735913,0,A collaborative study on the malignant syndrome in Parkinson's disease and related disorders.,"We report the results of a collaborative study on malignant syndrome (MS) that developed in patients being treated with levodopa and other anti-parkinsonian drugs. We analyzed clinical features, laboratory findings, precipitating events, and risk factors for poor outcome. The study was conducted in five centers in Japan. Patients who developed MS between January 1991 and December 1997 were included. The enrollment criteria used were the same as those for neuroleptic MS proposed by Levenson et al. (1985).A total of 99 episodes were encountered in 93 patients (72 with Parkinson's disease and 21 with secondary parkinsonism); one patient had four recurrences of MS and three patients had two recurrences. High fever was the most frequent clinical manifestation of MS followed by worsening of parkinsonism, and then altered levels of consciousness. Serum creatine kinase was abnormally elevated in all the patients studied. Life-threatening complications were rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute renal failure. The most frequent precipitating event was discontinuation or dose reduction of anti-parkinsonian drugs, particularly levodopa. No drug was the exception in the precipitation of MS. Intercurrent infection was the next most common precipitating event. MS developed without drug withdrawal or infection in some patients. In five patients, severe ""wearing off"" phenomenon was the only event preceding the onset of MS. Hot weather and dehydration appeared to be the cause in three patients. Among the total of 99 episodes, patients recovered to the pre-MS state following 68 episodes (68.7%); in the remaining 31.3%, patients failed to recover to their previous state. Older age, higher Hoehn and Yahr stage during the symptomatic phase of MS, higher akinesia score, and the absence of wearing off phenomenon prior to developing MS were associated with poor outcome. The most frequently used treatments of MS were intravenous fluid, levodopa, dantrolene sodium, and intragastric bromocriptine. Early introduction of treatment is important. Any elevation of body temperature during the course of anti-parkinsonian drug treatment should be considered as MS until proved otherwise."

CD009647,0,17003814,0,Renal failure in 57 925 patients undergoing coronary procedures using iso-osmolar or low-osmolar contrast media.,"We compared the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry with the Swedish 'Hospital Discharge Register' to assess contrast media (CM)-induced renal failure. Hospitals used only one type CM. From 2000 to 2003, iodixanol (iso-osmolar) was used in 45 485 patients, ioxaglate (low osmolar) in 12 440 subjects. To include the earlier used CM iohexol (low osmolar), analysis extended back to 1990 (86 334 patients). Incidence of clinically significant renal failure was greatest for patients receiving the iso-osmolar CM iodixanol (1.7%). Ioxaglate-treated patients had a significantly lower renal failure incidence (0.8%, P<0.001). The odds ratio for iodixanol-treated patients was significantly higher than for ioxaglate (1 vs 0.48, P<0.001). In subsets of either diabetic patients or patients with previous renal failure, odds ratios for renal failure remained greater in the iodixanol groups (P<0.01). Hospitals switching CM to iodixanol experienced a doubling in clinically significant renal failure after cardiac procedures. Dialysis was required in 0.2% of patients receiving iodixanol, which was significantly higher (P<0.01) than for ioxaglate-treated patients (0.1%). Iohexol-treated patients had a similar low risk for developing clinically significant renal failure (0.9%) as ioxaglate. In conclusion, risk of developing renal failure and required dialysis after coronary procedures is higher when patients received iodixanol than ioxaglate or iohexol."
CD009647,0,7065350,0,Acute suppurative cholangitis: comparison of internal and external biliary drainage.,"Forty-eight patients with acute cholangitis who presented with postcholocystectomy choledocholithiasis are reported on in this study. As soon as the general condition of the patients had improved, or as soon as the fluid balance was established, usually within 48 hours of admission, the patients were divided into two groups: group A (28 patients) under went choledochoduodenostomy, and group B (20 patients) had T-tube drainage. The results demonstrate that internal biliary drainage in patients with acute cholangitis is associated with lower mortality and morbidity, and that further recurrent choledocholithiasis is eliminated after choledochoduodenostomy, which was the drainage procedure used exclusively in this series of patients. We believe that this difference in results is due first to the elimination of the possibility of exogenous contamination through the T tube when internal drainage is used, and second to the difference in the caliber and length of th two drainage systems."
CD009647,0,2548784,0,Physiological significance of increased levels of endogenous atrial natriuretic factor in human acute renal failure.,"In twelve patients with acute renal failure, mean plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and of its second messenger cGMP were found elevated at the early phase of the disease, but tended to return towards normal values at recovery. Variations of plasma ANF and cGMP were correlated significantly (p less than 0.05) with those of total blood volume. At the early phase of the disease, plasma ANF was also correlated with the excreted fraction of filtered sodium (FENa) (r = 0.95). Moreover, plasma ANF and FENa peaked concomitantly at the onset of the diuretic phase in the five patients who were not treated by diuretics or dialysis and were studied sequentially during the course of the disease. It is suggested that enhanced plasma ANF levels might reflect one of the mechanisms of adaptation controlling body fluid balance in acute renal failure."

CD009647,0,22079871,0,Nocturia in older men.,"Nocturia is a common and bothersome symptom that impacts on sleep-quality and quality of life. Nocturia often has a multi-factorial etiology which makes thorough assessment of the complaint indispensable. This review summarizes the definition of nocturia, its epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnostics, and treatment options with special reference to older men. Nocturia is defined as a nocturnal voiding frequency of two or more, based on impact on quality of life. It is very prevalent in older men. Apart from the negative effects of sleep-disruption, it may be a risk-factor for hip fractures and increased mortality. Most common causes are: nocturnal polyuria, 24-h polyuria, overactive bladder (sometimes due to BPH) and sleep disturbance. A clear understanding of the etiology in the individual patient is indispensable when addressing the various possible causes and co-morbidities. Most important tool for this is the frequency-volume chart, but also patient history, physical examination and serum analysis. For treatment, lifestyle adjustments are often helpful. Medical therapy with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, alpha-blockers, a combination of the two, or anti-muscarinics, has a limited effect. Most important medical option is desmopressin (arginine vasopressin analogue); however, treatment with this drug is limited to men under 65 years mainly due to the risk of hyponatraemia."

CD009647,0,17656064,0,[News in peritoneal dialysis].,"Peritoneal dialysis, like hemodialysis, is a first-line therapy for patients with end-stage renal disease. Progress in medical devices and materials has reduced infectious complications such as peritonitis and catheter exit-site infections and thus decreased morbidity. Peritoneal dialysis fluids are increasingly biocompatible, result in fewer glucose degradation products, protect the peritoneal membrane better and thus improve tolerance. The maintenance of residual renal function, together with better comfort and no pain, help control the fluid and sodium balance. Automated peritoneal dialysis can be performed each night, either autonomously or assisted by a visiting nurse twice a day (to prepare, connect, and disconnect the machine). This treatment can thus be provided to most patients, regardless of their age. Peritoneal dialysis is indicated principally for young people waiting for a kidney transplantation (to preserve their vascular network), elderly patients who wish to remain either at home or in an institution, and patients with cardiac insufficiency, because of the better hemodynamic tolerance. Numerous obstacles, mainly nonmedical, still impede the development of peritoneal dialysis. Patients seen in emergencies start hemodialysis without necessarily receiving any information about peritoneal dialysis. Indeed, neither physicians nor patients receive adequate information."
CD009647,0,3780838,0,Diuretic activity of torasemide and furosemide in chronic heart failure: a comparative double blind cross-over study.,"The diuretic effects of torasemide and of furosemide were compared in a double blind cross-over study in 13 patients with stable chronic heart failure. Single doses of 10 mg and 20 mg of torasemide and of 40 mg of furosemide were given orally, in a randomized order on 3 consecutive days. In addition, a placebo was administered on the day preceding the 3 active drug treatment days to obtain control data. Each experimental day was divided into three urine collection periods - 0 to 4 h, 4 to 12 h and 12 to 24 h. Urine output, ion excretion and clearance were measured during each of the 3 periods as well as for the 24-h period. Torasemide 20 mg was distinctly more active in each of the 3 collection periods and in the 24-h period than furosemide 40 mg, whereas no significant difference was found between furosemide 40 mg and torasemide 10 mg for most of the experimental data. From 0 to 4 h, both torasemide and furosemide significantly increased the urinary flow rate and the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride and calcium, while they decreased the urinary osmolality when compared to placebo. All the effects persisted in the 4 to 12 h period after torasemide 20 mg in contrast to furosemide, whose effects were limited to the 0 to 4 h period. In the third period (12-24 h), the urine volume fell below the placebo value after furosemide but not torasemide, and only torasemide 20 mg was followed by a persistent decrease in the urine osmolality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009647,0,22398670,0,Edema index-guided disease management improves 6-month outcomes of patients with acute heart failure.,"The efficacy of heart failure (HF) management programs is compromised by the challenge of early identification of patients at imminent risk. Segmental multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis can generate an ""edema index"" (EI) as a surrogate for the body fluid status. In this study, we tested whether integration of EI-guided management improved the 6-month outcomes of HF patients under multidisciplinary care. In total, 159 patients with acute HF were randomized into control, case management (CM), and EI-guided CM (EI) groups (n = 53 in each group). In the EI group, a management algorithm was designed based on the measured EI. The analyzed endpoints included HF-related and all cause-related events during the 6-month follow-up period. In the 6 months, there were 11 (6.9%) deaths, 19 (11.9%) HF-related rehospitalizations, and 45 (28.3%) all-cause-related rehospitalizations. Compared to the control (26.4%) and CM groups (15.1%), the EI group had a lower rate of HF-related death and rehospitalization (3.8%, P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed that EI-guided management was an independent predictor of a lower HF-related event rate (hazard ratio = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.03~0.66, P = 0.012). Patients with a higher pre-discharge EI were older, had lower blood albumin and hemoglobin levels, and had a higher functional class and incidences of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. An increase in the pre-discharge EI by 0.001 increased the HF-related event rate by 6% (P = 0.002). Use of EI-guided management lowered this risk (P = 0.03). In conclusion, an EI-based HF management program demonstrated an event-lowering effect superior to traditional nurse-led multidisciplinary care in 6 months after an acute HF episode."

CD009647,0,10460448,0,Outcome of central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis (n = 44).,"The findings in 44 patients (42 of whom were chronic alcoholics) with central pontine myelinolysis show that the outcome does not depend on the severity of neurological deficits during the acute phase of the condition or on concomitant internal diseases, including the degree of hyponatremia. Of the 34 patients for whom follow-up data were available, 32 survived. Of these 11 completely recovered, 11 had some deficits but were independent, and 10 were dependent (4 through disorders of memory or cognition, 3 with tetraparesis, 2 with cerebellar ataxia, 1 with polyneuropathy). The electrophysiological findings did not contribute usefully to the prediction of outcome. Additional neuroradiological diagnostic testing with magnetic resonance imaging was also of no prognostic significance. The extent of the initial pontine lesion was not correlated with the severity of clinical findings during the acute phase of disease, nor was persistence of the pontine lesion as usually seen on magnetic resonance imaging correlated with clinical improvement. We conclude that patients with cerebral myelinolysis survive if the nonspecific secondary complications of transient illnesses such as aspiration pneumonia, ascending urinary tract infection with subsequent septicemia, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism can be avoided."

We used a monitor Hospal Monitral-S with Hospal DPM (Display Programmer Module) that allows the programming of 'weight loss rate' and 'dialysate osmolality'. During standard haemodialysis fluid was removed at a constant rate of 1 kg/h with constant sodium dialysate of 143 mmol/l.

Significantly higher concentrations of these amino acids were found in two patients (glutamate 37.8 and 22.4 microM, aspartate 2.2 and 0.6 microM) with symptoms of impaired brain tissue perfusion, i.e. relative ischemia due to severely increased intraventricular CSF pressure.

CD009647,0,7506495,0,Synthesis and vectorial export of cGMP in airway epithelium: expression of soluble and CNP-specific guanylate cyclases.,"Guanosine 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) is an important modulator of fluid balance in many epithelia. We examined its metabolism in primary cultures of human airway epithelia. Sodium nitroprusside increased cGMP levels 30-fold, suggesting that the respiratory epithelium expresses a soluble guanylate cyclase; however, endogenous nitric oxide production was not detected. cGMP levels could also be increased by C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), but not by atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, or Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin, indicating expression of a CNP-specific membrane-bound guanylate cyclase. The one-half effective concentration for CNP was 40 nM and the maximal velocity was 56.7 pmol cGMP.mg protein-1.h-1. After CNP stimulation, approximately 60% of the total synthesized cGMP was preferentially exported from the polarized epithelial cells across the basolateral membrane by a probenecid-sensitive process. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) export revealed a similar export pattern and probenecid sensitivity, although a lower efficiency of export (27% of total cAMP was exported). Consistent with previous reports, export of neither cyclic nucleotide was saturable at the concentrations tested. We conclude that the respiratory epithelium expresses a soluble guanylate cyclase, a CNP-specific receptor, and a novel vectorial cyclic nucleotide export mechanism."
CD009647,0,17727573,0,Basis and therapeutical rationale of the urinary concentrating mechanism.,"The urine-concentrating mechanism performs one of the most essential functions in water and electrolyte metabolism and serves primarily to maintain extracellular osmolality within a very narrow range. The history of anti-diuresis dates back more than 100 years and includes the discovery of antidiuretic hormone (AVP), the renal AVP receptor, and most recently the water channel (aquaporin) proteins. Today, the mechanisms of antidiuresis are understood on a highly detailed molecular level including both short term and long-term regulation of AQP2 function. Furthermore, the background behind many acquired and inherited disturbances of water balance has now been revealed and has enabled a precise differential diagnosis. These include different forms of diabetes insipidus, nocturnal enuresis and nocturia in the elderly. Diabetes insipidus represents a dramatic but rare disturbance of water balance caused by deficient AVP secretion (neurogenic), reduced renal sensitivity to AVP (nephrogenic), an abnormally high fluid intake (primary polydipsia), or in rare cases by placental enzymatic degradation of AVP (gestational). Nocturnal enuresis and nocturia in the elderly represents much more common disturbances and share common pathogenic features including an abnormally high nocturnal urine production. This seems at least in part to be caused by abnormally low levels of plasma AVP during night. The increased understanding of such water balance disturbances have changed dramatically prior treatment practice by introducing antidiuresis as a treatment modality. The ongoing progress in our understanding of antidiuresis may provide the basis for the development of new antidiuretic compounds."

Consideration is also given to constipation associated with diverticular disease and ulcerative colitis. We also discuss the pathogenesis of fecal incontinence in the elderly, paying particular attention to fecal impaction and neurological causes that result in both constipation and incontinence.

CD009647,0,16763365,0,Physiological and subjective responses to low relative humidity in young and elderly men.,"In order to compare the physiological and the subjective responses to low relative humidity of elderly and young men, we measured saccharin clearance time (SCT), frequency of blinking, hydration state of the skin, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), sebum level recovery and skin temperatures as physiological responses. We asked subjects to evaluate thermal, dryness and comfort sensations as subjective responses using a rating scale. Eight non-smoking healthy male students (21.7+/-0.8 yr) and eight non-smoking healthy elderly men (71.1+/-4.1 yr) were selected. The pre-room conditions were maintained at an air temperature (Ta) of 25 degrees C and a relative humidity (RH) of 50%. The test-room conditions were adjusted to provide 25 degrees C Ta and RH levels of 10%, 30% and 50%. RH had no effect on the activity of the sebaceous gland or change of mean skin temperature. SCT of the elderly group under 10% RH was significantly longer than that of the young group. In particular, considering the SCT change, the nasal mucous membrane seems to be affected more in the elderly than in the young in low RH. Under 30% RH, the eyes and skin become dry, and under 10% RH the nasal mucous membrane becomes dry as well as the eyes and skin. These findings suggested that to avoid dryness of the eyes and skin, it is necessary to maintain greater than 30% RH, and to avoid dryness of the nasal mucous membrane, it is necessary to maintain greater than 10% RH. On the thermal sensation of the legs, at the lower humidity level, the elderly group felt cooler than the young group. On the dry sensation of the eyes and throat, the young group felt drier than the elderly group at the lower humidity levels. From the above results, the elderly group had difficulty in feeling dryness in the nasal mucous membrane despite being easily affected by low humidity. On the other hand, the young group felt the change of humidity sensitively despite not being severely affected by low humidity. Ocular mucosa and physiology of skin by dryness showed no difference by age. In the effect of longer exposure (180 min.) to low RH, only TEWL showed a slight decrease after 120 minutes in 30% RH, and all the measured results showed no noticeable differences compared with the result at 120 minutes."
CD009647,0,19462425,0,Time-dependent electrical properties of human nail upon hydration in vivo.,"The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of hydration and solution ion concentration on the electrical properties of human nail in vivo and compare these in vivo results with those in vitro. In vivo electrical resistance measurements on the nail were conducted with a three-electrode system in phosphate buffered saline of 0.01-0.6 M. The effect of electric current on nail resistance and possible adverse effects were studied under 1.5- and 9-V iontophoresis in vivo. The electrical resistance of the nail plate was measured in vitro in side-by-side diffusion cells under the same conditions and compared with those in vivo. The in vivo electrical resistance decreased significantly upon 2-h nail hydration and then slowly decreased to a constant value, showing the same pattern as that in vitro. No significant effect of the applied voltage upon the nail electrical resistance was observed. Higher current densities caused moderate sensation and slight changes in nail appearance after iontophoresis. The observed decrease in nail resistance demonstrates the significance of nail hydration in transungual iontophoresis. The in vitro and in vivo correlation suggests that the in vitro nail plate can be a model in the research and development of transungual iontophoretic delivery."

The operations included: isolated coronary artery bypass grafting in 12 patients, coronary artery bypass grafting plus mitral ring annuloplasty in 1 patient, mitro aortic valve replacement in 2 patients, isolated aortic valve replacement in 1 patient, aortic valved conduit implantation in 1 patients and mitral valve replacement plus tricuspid annuloplasty in 1 patient. There were 10 and 3 patients in CCS functional classification III and IV respectively; 1 and 4 patients were in NYHA classification II and III respectively. All of them were hemodialyzed the day before surgery: the average time they had been on hemodialysis was 6.5 years. Anesthesia and the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in these patients required attention in order to provide the optimal fluids and electrolytes balance: particularly intravenously administered fluids were kept to a minimum and drug dosages were reduced to recommended levels for anephric patients. An hemoconcentrator was used in all patients during the CPB and, in the last 4 cases, we used a dialysis filter and a sterilized perfusional solution to reduce the level of potassium and to put off postoperative dialysis."

CD009647,0,14681709,0,Impact of mild dehydration on wellness and on exercise performance.,"Chronic mild dehydration is a common condition in some population groups, including especially the elderly and those who participate in physical activity in warm environments. Hypohydration is recognised as a precipitating factor in a number of acute medical conditions in the elderly, and there may be an association, although not necessarily a causal one, between a low habitual fluid intake and some cancers, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. There is some evidence of impairments of cognitive function at moderate levels of hypohydration, but even short periods of fluid restriction, leading to a loss of body mass of 1-2%, lead to reductions in the subjective perception of alertness and ability to concentrate and to increases in self-reported tiredness and headache. In exercise lasting more than a few minutes, hypohydration clearly impairs performance capacity, but muscle strength appears to be relatively unaffected."
CD009647,0,16902265,0,Risk factors for heatstroke among Japanese forestry workers.,"We examined the risk factors for heatstroke among forestry workers in Japan during the summer. We distributed a questionnaire to 124 forestry workers to determine heatstroke symptoms, degree of sweating and hydration, as well as perceived hotness and amount of sunlight at work sites. Forty of the workers (32.3%) reported experiencing heatstroke symptoms. Thirteen and 21 of them reported such symptoms during July and August, respectively. Eleven workers experienced heatstroke at around 14:00; 5 and 4 developed symptoms at around 11:00 and 10:00, respectively. Groups with and without heatstroke symptoms significantly differed in terms of perceived hotness (p<0.05), sunlight (p<0.05), degree of sweating (p<0.01) and frequency of hydration (p<0.05) while working. Heatstroke symptoms developed in 60.6% of workers aged up to 50 yr, but in only 22.0% of those over the age of 51 (p<0.01). Multiple regression analysis selected the following key variables associated with the development of heatstroke symptoms (R(2)=0.236 and p=0.006): frequency of urination, hotness, BMI and years of forestry work (standard coefficients: +0.229, +0.194, +0.280 and -0.162, respectively). The results of the present study showed that one third of forestry workers developed some symptoms of early heatstroke during summer forestry work. Furthermore, the results indicate that a short duration of forestry service was one of the risk factors contributing to the onset of heatstroke, in addition to heat stress, loss of body water and electrolytes, and obesity."
CD009647,0,8911541,0,Early aneurysm surgery and dehydration therapy in patients with severe subarachnoid haemorrhage without ICH.,"We prospectively analysed treatment results in patients with severe subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) who underwent early aneurysm surgery, and were managed by dehydration therapy. We studied a total of 31 patients with poor-grade SAH including 18 in grade IV, and 13 in grade V according to the WFNS classification system. Patients who were older than 70 years of age, or those with an intracerebral haemorrhage or absent brainstem response were excluded from this study. At surgery, clot evacuation from the peri-brainstem cisterns with/without external decompression was performed following obliteration of the aneurysmal neck. In the early postoperative period, patients were maintained in negative water balance using osmotic diuretics. When delayed ischaemic deficits had manifested themselves, the pulmonary wedge pressure and/or central venous pressure was immediately increased by the rapid injection of albumin until hypovolaemia reverted to normovolaemia with the continuous administration of dobutamine. The outcome at 3 months was good recovery in 16 (52%) patients, moderate disability in 3 (10%), severe disability in 5 (16%), a vegetative state in 1 (3%), and death in 6 (19%). We though that early aneurysm surgery and postoperative dehydration therapy in the acute stages of brain oedema resulting from primary brain damage are effective in the treatment of patients with severe SAH but reversible primary brain damage."

CD009647,0,2698142,0,The importance of thirst in maintenance of fluid balance.,"Plasma osmolality is maintained within very narrow limits by the control of water intake via thirst and water output via secretion of vasopressin. Osmoreceptors are situated in the brain, but on the blood side of the blood-brain barrier in a circumventricular organ. These regions are stimulated by an increase in plasma osmolality and form the most important input to cause thirst and drinking. Cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreceptors sensitive to blood volume and blood pressure also can be important, so hypovolaemic events such as haemorrhage can stimulate thirst. Both raised plasma osmolality and reduced blood volume contribute to thirst and vasopressin secretion following water deprivation. The importance of the nucleus medianus in the neural circuitary involved in integrating thirst should be emphasized. Mechanisms which stop drinking are different from those which initiate it, and oropharyngeal metering of the volume of fluid consumed provides the important input. There are a number of situations in humans where thirst thresholds and sensitivities are altered. The elderly have higher thirst thresholds and this can cause symptoms of dehydration. Increased drinking is seen in congestive heart failure, renal hypertension and certain cerebral lesions. Thirst thresholds are set at lower levels in pregnancy and in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and may contribute to fluid retention in these situations."
CD009647,0,11201974,0,[Susceptibility of the elderly patient to hyponatremia induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors].,"Numerous spontaneous reports of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) have followed the increased use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). It has been estimated that 1 in 200 patients treated per year developed SIADH, age and low body weight being particular risk factors. No clear gender effect has been detected when confounding factors such as body weight or antidepressant consumption are taken into account. Age-related susceptibility to hyponatraemia may be explained by physiological changes in renal and endocrine function. The high prevalence of polymedication and pluripathology in the elderly may be a contributing factor as well. To date, no study has demonstrated how SSRIs affect the regulation of fluid/sodium balance nor whether they have an independent effect on this regulation in depressed subjects."

We managed intraoperative anticoagulantless continuous hemodialysis (CHD) with ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL) dialyzer in four patients on maintenance hemodialysis. All patients could be managed satisfactorily with no coagulation. Only in the first patient, we used nafamostat mesilate to avoid coagulation in the dialyzer. In this patient, activated clotting time (ACT) was 151 seconds. Their recovery from anesthesia was good, and they showed no complications perioperatively. This is a good method to manage these patients during operation, because EVAL dialyzer is cheap and we need not take care of hemorrhage.

CD009647,0,22109355,0,APJ polymorphisms in coronary artery disease patients with and without hypertension.,"Apelin is an endogenous peptide that increases cardiac inotropism through its APJ receptor. Certain findings indicate that the apelinergic system may have a pathophysiological role in cardiovascular disease and there is evidence showing the role of the apelinergic system in blood pressure regulation in vitro and in animal models. The role of the apelin-APJ system in cardiovascular physiology and its interaction with other neuroendocrine pathways has not been fully elucidated. However, the small number of reported studies indicates that apelin signaling may be involved in the regulation of blood pressure, cardiac contractile function, fluid balance, angiogenesis and inhibition of apoptosis. We evaluated the possible relationship between the G212A and A445C APJ polymorphisms and coronary artery disease (CAD) in Italian patients and in healthy controls by RFLP-PCR. We analyzed the allelic and genotypic frequencies of APJ polymorphisms in 664 patients (378 with hypertension) and 143 controls. There were no differences between allelic and genotypic frequencies in patients in respect to the controls for both polymorphisms analyzed. In the CAD population, there was an increased frequency of the G212 allele in patients with hypertension in respect to patients without hypertension. No differences were present in the two subgroups for the A445C polymorphism. Although the functional role of the G212A polymorphism has not yet been identified, it is possible to hypothesize that the presence of the A allele may cause a gain in function of the apelin/APJ system associated with a lower risk of hypertension."

CD009647,0,3790379,0,"Hormonal, global, and regional haemodynamic responses to a vascular antagonist of vasopressin in patients with congestive heart failure with and without hyponatraemia.","The pathophysiological role of an increase in circulating vasopressin in sustaining global and regional vasoconstriction in patients with congestive heart failure has not been established, particularly in patients with hyponatraemia. To assess this further, 20 patients with congestive heart failure refractory to digoxin and diuretics were studied before and 60 minutes after the intravenous injection (5 micrograms/kg) of the vascular antagonist of vasopressin [1(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylene-propionic acid), 2-(0-methyl) tyrosine] arginine vasopressin. Ten patients were hyponatraemic (plasma sodium less than 135 mmol/l) and 10 were normonatraemic. In both groups of patients the vascular vasopressin antagonist did not alter systemic or pulmonary artery pressures, right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, or vascular resistances. Furthermore, there was no change in skin and hepatic blood flow in either group after the injection of the vascular antagonist. Only one patient in the hyponatraemic group showed considerable haemodynamic improvement. He had severe congestive heart failure and a high concentration of plasma vasopressin (51 pmol/l). Plasma renin activity, vasopressin, or catecholamine concentrations were not significantly changed in response to the administration of the vasopressin antagonist in either the hyponatraemic or the normonatraemic groups. Patients with hyponatraemia, however, had higher baseline plasma catecholamine concentrations, heart rate, pulmonary pressure and resistance, and lower hepatic blood flow than patients without hyponatraemia. Plasma vasopressin and plasma renin activity were slightly, though not significantly, higher in the hyponatraemic group. Thus the role of vasopressin in sustaining regional or global vasoconstriction seems limited in patients with congestive heart failure whether or not concomitant hyponatraemia is present. Vasopressin significantly increases the vascular tone only in rare patients with severe congestive heart failure and considerably increased vasopressin concentrations. Patients with hyponatraemia do, however, have raised baseline catecholamine concentrations, heart rate, pulmonary arterial pressure and resistance, and decreased hepatic blood flow."
CD009647,0,8375450,0,Reliability of clinical assessment of fluid absorption in transurethral prostatic resection.,"We evaluated 5 frequently used clinical methods of assessing absorption of irrigation fluid during 118 transurethral prostatic resections. The use of an irrigating solution containing glycine 1.5% and ethanol 1% and subsequent analysis of the alcohol concentration in the exhaled breath (ethanol monitoring) served as control method. Most cases of fluid absorption in excess of 1,000 ml could be indicated from a combination of clinical observations made by the surgeon and the anaesthetic nurse, and by measuring the serum sodium concentration. 'False alarms' were common, however. The volumetric fluid balance did not accurately reflect absorption. We conclude that none of the routine methods alone was specific enough to suffice for detection of irrigation fluid."

Measurement of total exchangeable potassium in 11 cirrhotic patients with ascites revealed marked depletion compared to 9 healthy volunteers. Total exchangeable potassium was 50.8 +/- 5.1 m moles/L TBW in the patient group compared to 75.2 +/- 3.4 m moles/L TBW in the control group (P less than 0.01, Mann-Whitney U Test). Total body exchangeable sodium measured 80.1 +/- 3.7 m mole/L TBW in the cirrhotic group, which is not significantly elevated compared to the value in healthy volunteers of 74.1 +/- 1.9 m mole/L TBW. Serum sodium was low in four of the cirrhotic patients (129-133 mEq/L); exchangeable sodium was low in only one of these four (53.4 m mole/L TBW). Serum potassium was low in two of the cirrhotics (2.6-2.9 mEq/L); total body potassium was depressed in both of these patients (43.5-50.1 m mole/L TBW). An additional three patients had a low total body potassium (29.6-48.9 m mole/L TBW) with normal serum levels (4.0-4.2 mEq/L). There was no correlation between serum and total exchangeable electrolyte levels (Pearson's regression, r = 0.16 and 0.23). This work confirms that serum levels are not reliable indicators of true body sodium and potassium stores. The decreased total exchangeable potassium appears to be related to loss of body cell mass rather than intracellular potassium depletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009647,0,22073832,0,Bioimpedance spectroscopy for the detection of hypervolemia in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"A practical, inexpensive, and reliable method is needed for the assessment of volume status in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. In the present study, we investigated the efficiency of bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) for detection of hypervolemia. The study enrolled 79 prevalent PD patients (mean age: 47 +/- 14 years; PD duration: 30 +/- 17 months; 55% men; 19% with diabetes) from a single center. Echocardiography and body composition analysis using the BIS technique [50 frequencies (Body Composition Monitor: Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany)] were performed. Overhydration (OH) and extracellular water (ECW) in liters and OH/ECW ratio were used as volume indices. The mean left ventricular (LV) mass index was 117 +/- 37 g/m2, and 46% of patients had LV hypertrophy (LVH). Mean OH and OH/ECW ratio were 1.3 +/- 1.7 L and 7.6% +/- 9.3% respectively The OH/ ECW ratio correlated with LV mass index (r = 0.237, p < 0.036) and with left atrium index (r = 0.354, p < 0.001). Compared with patients not having LVH, patients with LVH had higher OH values (1.79 +/- 1.82 L vs 0.93 +/- 1.62 L, p = 0.003). In linear regression analysis, the OH/ECW ratio was an independent risk factor for LVH (t = 2.558, p = 0.01). In PD patients, BIS is a reliable method for evaluating volume status. The OH/ECW measured by BIS is a major determinant of LV mass. Control of hypervolemia and blood pressure is associated with better cardiac condition."

We employed continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in two cases, hemodialysis with extracorporeal ultrafiltration method (ECUM + HD) in one case and hemodiafiltration with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVHF + HDF) in one case for perioperative management. In each cases, intermittent HD was undergone during 4 days before operation. Intraoperatively, HD was used together with extracorporeal circulation. Blood pressure in the postoperative course changed more frequently in CAPD cases than ECUM + HD or CVVHF + HDF case. Especially, CVVHF + HDF stabilized the movement of circulation and kept balance of serum BUN, Cr after the operation (BUN; 27.2 +/- 6.3, Cr; 5.0 +/- 0.6). We concluded that CVVHF + HDF would be the most favorable method to maintain the fluid balance stably for the uremic patients after CABG."
CD009647,0,22445241,0,[Orthostatic hypotension: epidemiology and mechanisms].,"Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure more than or equal to 20 mm Hg or diastolic more than or equal to 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing up. Discharge records for 0.4% of all hospitalizations include OH as a diagnosis. The prevalence of OH is related to aging, reaching 5 to 30% in unselected elders aged more than or equal to 65 years, especially those treated for hypertension and/or living in nursing homes or health care facilities. OH is associated with an increased risk of syncope and subsequent cardiovascular mortality. Standing results in pooling of 25-30% of blood in the lower extremities and splanchnic-mesenteric circulation, thereby reducing venous return, ventricular filling, cardiac output and, in turn, blood pressure. Compensatory mechanisms to maintain BP involve the baroreflex and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Failure of SNS results in neurogenic OH, which is severe in multiple system atrophy with dysautonomia (Shy-Drager syndrome), also commonly seen in patients with Lewy body dementia and in patients with Parkinson's disease, in whom OH is less severe and occurs later. Conversely, SNS function is preserved in secondary OH associated with hypovolemia, anemia, antihypertensive or psychotropic drugs. Clinical manifestations and tolerance of OH depends on its severity and on cerebral blood flow autoregulation, which both impact on the risk of syncope, trauma and subsequent prognosis."

The effects of exercise training on glucose homeostasis independent of weight loss in older glucose-intolerant individuals are not well established. We examined the effects of exercise training on oral glucose tolerance, insulin action, and concentration of the GLUT-4 glucose transporters in skeletal muscle. Exercise training at 50 and 75% of heart rate reserve was performed for 12 wk in 18 individuals (age = 64 +/- 2, body fat = 37.0 +/- 1.5%). Peripheral insulin action was determined 96 h after the last exercise bout using a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp (insulin = 192 and 708 pmol/l). Percent body fat and fat-free mass (FFM) were unchanged with training. Diet composition, assessed by diet record, did not change over the 12 wk. Improved oral glucose tolerance was observed, as exhibited by lower plasma glucose concentrations after training (P < 0.05), whereas plasma insulin response remained unchanged. The rate of glucose disposal was unchanged during the low insulin concentration but increased 11.0% at the high insulin concentration (P < 0.05) after training (54.4 +/- 4.4 vs. 60.4 +/- 5.5 mumol.kg FFM-1.min-1). Skeletal muscle glycogen and GLUT-4 concentration increased 24 and 60%, respectively, with training. There was no direct relationship between the change in GLUT-4 protein and the change in glucose disposal rate.

What do we really measure?,"Changes in electrical resistance (delta R), water (delta H2O), and blood variables (Na+, K+, Cl-, protein [Pr], osmolality [Osmo], hemoglobin [Hb], and hematocrit [Hct]) were monitored during hemodialysis in 20 subjects. Average delta H2O was 1.69 +/- 0.91 liters. Blood, R, and circumferences (C) were measured for the upper limb (UL), lower limb (LL), and total body (TB) before, midway, and at the end of dialysis. Segmental volumes (V) and specific resistivity (rho) were computed. delta Hct and delta Pr were stronger predictors of delta H2O than delta R. Forward stepwise regression analysis using delta R at 5, 50, and 548 kHz, delta Pr, and delta Hct showed that delta Hct and delta Pr alone accounted for 77% of the variance in delta TBW. Adding delta R increased this at most to 81%. Both the UL and LL had significant increases in rho. The volumetric change of the UL was nonsignificant, whereas that of the LL accounted for over one half of the delta H2O. Single frequency bioimpedance cannot be used to monitor dialytic delta H2O unless one accounts for fluid composition changes. Monitoring bioimpedance changes over only a single body segment is also questioned."

Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration allows an adequate, slow removal of fluid, electrolytes, and waste products by combining diffusive and convective solute transport. Eight patients with acute renal failure, after cardiovascular surgery and cardiogenic shock, were treated by continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. An automatic system (Equaline System, Amicon Division, USA) was employed. Venous accesses (femoral or subclavian) were used with double lumen catheters. A polysulfone filter (0.4 m2) was used in the study. Blood flow was 30 ml/min and dialysate flow rate 16.6 ml/min. Sterile pyrogen-free hemofiltration substitution fluid was used as dialysate. Mean duration of treatment was 10.3 +/- 3.2 days. After 72 hours blood urea nitrogen levels dropped from 136 +/- 46.13 to 53.5 +/- 12.3 mg/dl and creatinine levels dropped from 6.9 +/- 1.7 to 2.6 +/- 0.9 mg/dl. A controlled steady-state was then maintained. Mean urea clearance was 21 +/- 5.3 ml/min; mean ultrafiltration rate was 20.3 +/- 4.1 L/day. Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, with the Equaline System, is effective for the clearance of waste products and is able to maintain perfect fluid balance in catabolic patients with acute renal failure and multiple organ failure."

The maximum changes of the roentgenologic thoracic diameter, measured monthly for one year in 31 patients, varied from 10 to 68 mm. The average differences of RHS and CTR between maximum inspiration and forced inspiration in 18 healthy people were 1 mm (RHS) and 2.5% (CTR), respectively, and the change of roentgenologic thoracic diameter was 12 mm. The error of repeated CTR measurements in a period of one year could be estimated more than 2%. In 22 patients the body weight reduction of 1 kg corresponded to a 4 mm decrease of RHS (p less than 0.005) and 1.5% of CTR (p less than 0.05), respectively. In relation to the change of body fluid balance assessed by the change of body weight, RHS showed a higher correlation than CTR. These results could be attributed that RHS was hardly influenced by the respiration, whereas CTR was surprisingly affected. It is concluded that the measurement of RHS is more useful as an index of control of body fluid balance than CTR."

In the mean, estimated (V(est) = 3.0 +/- 1.4 L) and measured volumes (Vmeas = 3.4 +/- 1.1 L) correlated linearly: V(est) = 1.05 x Vmeas - 0.60, r2 = 0.68. Patients developed hypotension in half the treatments. Except for a larger decrease in systolic blood pressures in hypotensive (34 +/- 24 mmHg) vs. stable (14 +/- 15 mmHg) treatments, patient and treatment characteristics were not different between groups. However, at the end of hemodialysis, the difference V(est) - Vmeas was -0.8 +/- 0.9 L in hypotensive, and only 0.1 +/- 0.4 L in stable patients (p < 0.05). The difference between V(est) and Vmeas can be explained by a predominant removal of excess body water from central body compartments such as the trunk and the central blood volume during hypotension. These compartments are not adequately measured by whole body bioimpedance techniques. However, this information could be helpful in identifying patients with delayed peripheral fluid removal that may occur when either target weight is too low or UFR rates are too high."

CD009647,0,1942342,0,Risks of blood volume changes in hypogonadal men treated with testosterone enanthate for erectile impotence.,"Administration of anabolic steroids carries many risks. We present a series of 15 patients with primary hypogonadism who as a group had statistically significant increases in whole body hematocrit and red blood cell volume while on testosterone therapy of 300 mg. intramuscularly every 3 weeks. A small decrease in plasma volume over-all was not significant. Subsequent analyses compared subgroups whose whole body hematocrit during testosterone therapy was either 48% or greater (9) or less than 48% (6). Interaction effects indicated that the subgroups were similar when off testosterone but when on testosterone the former group exhibited an increase in red blood cell volume and a decrease in plasma volume, while the latter group had little change in either measurement. Subsequent to stopping testosterone therapy 2 patients in the whole body hematocrit 48% or greater group suffered strokes and 1 had transient ischemic attacks while on therapy. No one in the whole body hematocrit less than 48% group has had any cerebrovascular symptoms. Clinical implications, as well as cost-effective and practical suggestions for detecting possible dangerous hemoconcentration are discussed."

CD009647,0,3971726,0,Pathophysiology of adult respiratory distress syndrome after sepsis and surgical operations.,"To describe the natural history of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from the circulatory viewpoint, we measured hemodynamic and oxygen transport variables in a series of 126 postoperative and 65 septic ARDS patients. All patients had hypoxemia unresponsive to conservative measures and required mechanical ventilation. Data from this series were compared with data from normal healthy volunteers and from postoperative patients who did not develop ARDS. In addition, the temporal sequence of cardiorespiratory changes in the ARDS patients was observed for a 48-h period before and after ARDS was diagnosed. Before the development of ARDS, both postoperative and septic patients exhibited hypovolemia, pulmonary vasoconstriction, suboptimal myocardial performance, and reduced oxygen delivery and consumption relative to the increased needs of the hypercatabolic state. Because these antecedent changes were greater in ARDS patients who died, their early correction (in addition to standard ventilatory support) may prevent the development of ARDS and decrease its mortality."

CD009647,0,19225273,0,Hypopituitarism in the elderly: two case-reports with heterogeneous presentation.,"Hypopituitarism (HYPO) is an under-investigated disease in older patients. Symptoms, which may be life-threatening, are aspecific and often attributed to aging and/or related morbidities. We describe here the cases of two elderly patients who were ultimately diagnosed as having HYPO, the clinical presentations and etiologies of which were different. In the first patient, an invasive non-secreting pituitary macroadenoma causing HYPO was detected on brain morphological evaluation for head trauma secondary to falling. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy was started. Thyroid function evaluation showed hyperthyroidism (due to a known toxic multinodular goiter), which was already on treatment with methimazole; ultimately, after withdrawal of the antithyroid drug, secondary hypothyroidism occurred. The patient underwent non-radical pituitary surgery. Cognitive function, gait impairment and falling, which had previously been attributed only to aging, improved markedly after cortisone acetate and L-thyroxine replacement therapy. The second patient was hospitalized one month after the onset of hypotension, edema and pain in the legs, and progressive psychomotor impairment, which ultimately resulted in an intermittent soporous state. She was diagnosed as having global anterior HYPO secondary to empty sella, which caused severe multifaceted clinical and biochemical abnormalities (hyponatremia, pancytopenia, rhabdomyolysis). After treatment with i.v. fluids and hydrocortisone, the patient's clinical condition and biochemical alterations improved, and normalized over time with oral cortisone acetate and Lthyroxine combination therapy. Several protean symptoms that impair the quality of life of elderly patients are usually ascribed to aging. Such symptoms should be investigated with regard to possible HYPO, treatment of which can result in significant clinical benefit."

Patients received celecoxib, 400 mg twice a day (b.i.d.). (N = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg three times a day. (N = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg b.i.d. (N = 1996). Effects measured included: investigator-reported hypertension, edema or congestive heart failure, clinically important BP elevations, incidence of patients starting new antihypertensive medication, and increases in serum creatinine or reductions in creatinine clearance. Celecoxib was associated with a similar incidence of hypertension or edema to diclofenac but significantly lower than ibuprofen. The celecoxib group had significantly fewer initiations of antihypertensives versus ibuprofen. Systolic BP increases of >20 mmHg and above 140 mmHg occurred significantly less often with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen or diclofenac. Changes in serum creatinine or estimated creatinine clearance occurred in a similar percentage of patients taking celecoxib or ibuprofen; modest differences were evident against diclofenac. In patients with mild prerenal azotemia, significantly fewer patients taking celecoxib exhibited clinically important reductions in renal function (3.7%), compared with diclofenac (7.3%; P < 0.05) and ibuprofen (7.3%; P < 0.05).

Hematocrit increased from 19 +/- 4 to 33 +/- 5% (p less than 0.001). Systemic vascular resistance increased from 1,020 +/- 259 to 1,283 +/- 245 dyn/s/cm-5 (p less than 0.02), while mean arterial pressure remained unchanged. Cardiac index decreased (4.9 +/- 1.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.9 liters/min/m2; p less than 0.02), caused by a decrease in heart rate (87 +/- 21 to 75 +/- 16 beats/min; p less than 0.02) and stroke index (59.9 +/- 15.2 to 51.0 +/- 10.7 ml/m2; p less than 0.02). Red blood cell volume increased (468 +/- 105 to 858 +/- 203 ml/m2; p less than 0.001) and plasma volume decreased inversely ([125I]-albumin; 2,008 +/- 338 to 1,664 +/- 225 ml/m2; p less than 0.001), whereas total blood volume remained unaltered (2,476 +/- 397 to 2,518 +/- 352 ml/m2; n.s.). Total body weight increased (57.8 +/- 12 to 62.1 +/- 12 kg; p less than 0.02), indicative of an anabolic effect of rHuEpo therapy. Skin capillary circulation as measured by transcutaneous oxymetry at 37 degrees C skin temperature impaired, reflected by the increase of the time to peak after arterial occlusion (82 +/- 21 to 121 +/- 25 s; p less than 0.02). The reactive hyperemic response following the release of occlusion showed a significant increase at high hematocrit (10.7 +/- 4.2 to 16.6 +/- 5.3 mm Hg; p less than 0.02), whereas resting transcutaneous Po2 values showed a slight but not significant increase (2.3 +/- 1.3 to 4.7 +/- 3.3 mm Hg; n.s.). The high number of pathological capillaries in hemodialyzed patients might be an additional factor for the increase in systemic vascular resistance."
CD009647,0,17664641,0,Monitoring lung fluid content in CHF patients under intravenous diuretics treatment using bio-impedance measurements.,"A pulmonary edema monitoring system (PulmoTrace, CardioInspect, Tel-Aviv University, Israel) was evaluated for tracking lung resistivity during diuretics treatment in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. The system incorporates a bio-impedance measurement algorithm and enables, by employing an eight-electrode thoracic belt, the assessment of both the left- and right-lung resistivity values. A clinical study was conducted on a group of 13 CHF patients under intravenous diuretics treatment. The group was measured twice-before the beginning of treatment and following a period of a couple of hours. An increase of 8% of the mean lung resistivity (median value) was found between the two measuring sessions, which indicates a dehydration of the lungs, and a significant correlation (R=0.73, p=0.004) was found between the lung resistivity change and the urine output. In conjunction with previously reported results, which demonstrated the system's reproducibility and long-term monitoring capabilities, this study further supports the diagnostics value of the system."

CD009647,0,290799,0,Geriatric nutrition II: Dehydration in the elderly.,"Water balance in the elderly is critical in preventing tissue dehydration. Negative water balance, occurring when more water is lost than is retained, results in a severe decrease in all secretions. This ""drying out"" of tissues and organs, including muscles and joints, may lead to premature aging. Xerostomia is a major cause of denture discomfort and failure. The prosthodontist is advised to inspect and, if possible, correct dehydration of the oral tissues prior to constructing the denture. Denture failures may often result more from tissue deficiencies in the aged than from technical inadequacies. Water balance is efficiently achieved in the elderly through ingestion of soups containing many of the solubilized nutrients essential to tissue health. This is more beneficial than merely increasing the intake of plain water or beverages."
CD009647,0,8003753,0,Patient related factors leading to slow urea transfer in the body during dialysis.,"We studied the trans compartmental speed of urea transfer by comparing concentration changes of blood urea nitrogen to mass changes of urea during 80 dialyses in six patients. The speed of urea transfer was studied as a dependent factor of 15 patient characteristics: age; gender; fluid overload; and pre and post values of and change in pulse and temperature, calcitonin gene related peptide, and mean arterial blood pressure. Concentration changes in blood urea nitrogen were measured as pre and post dialysis urea concentration, the total urea in the body was measured by pre dialysis urea and tritium total body water determinations, and the actual mass of urea removed by collecting all dialysate. As a mean, concentration of blood urea nitrogen fell 54% but the mass urea removed was only 40% for a mean ratio of 1.41. Nine factors were associated with the speed of urea transfer. Patients with fast transfer had more normal fluid balance, a normal pulse rate, body temperature, calcitonin gene related peptide values, and blood pressure both before and after dialysis. The patients with a slower transfer of urea had a lower blood pressure before and after dialysis and a more labile pulse rate and body temperature. Patients with unpredictable urea transfer were the most edematous and had the most labile blood pressure. It is important to know which patients have slow urea transfer. Such patients should not be treated by fast dialysis, and those with the slowest rates may do particularly well on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,1464913,0,Identifying body fluid distribution by measuring electrical impedance.,"The effects of critical illness on extracellular water (ECW) and total body water (TBW) were measured using (1) a multiple dilutional technique, and (2) whole body and regional bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in a group of stable patients. Total body water and body resistance (R) were similar in patients when compared with normal healthy subjects (TBW: 45.1 +/- 4.5 vs. 46.2 +/- 3.4 L, p = 0.85; R: 518 +/- 42 vs. 500 +/- 22 omega, p = 0.70), and a significant relationship was present between these measurements (r = -0.87, p < 0.001). However, patients demonstrated an increase in ECW compared with controls (ECW: 18.6 +/- 1.3 vs. 14.7 +/- 1.1 L, p < 0.05). Expanded ECW values were associated with diminished electrical reactance (Xc) values (38 +/- 6 vs. 70 +/- 4 omega, p < 0.001) and these values were correlated (r = -0.67, p < 0.005). The ratio of Xc to R determined across the body and each of the segments was significantly lower in patients compared with controls (at least p < 0.005) and this ratio measured across a leg was the most sensitive predictor of health (Xc/R > or = 0.137) and disease (Xc/R < or = 0.101). Bioelectrical impedance analysis is a noninvasive and simple bedside technique that can be used to predict TBW and identify altered fluid distribution following critical illness."

The evidence for this recommendation appears to be weak because studies that have examined the comparative efficacy, safety, tolerability and effectiveness of SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) suggest that there are few advantages for one over another. Furthermore, a number of potential adverse effects of SSRIs are unappreciated risks. These include falls, hyponatremia, weight loss, sexual dysfunction and drug interactions. These potential risks, however, appear to be equally balanced by advantages such as fewer anticholinergic effects, a benign cardiovascular profile, ease of use and safety in overdose. SSRIs and TCAs have relative risks and benefits, and clinicians must maintain expertise in prescribing for elderly patients given both the frequency and severity of depressive disorders in late life."

We studied the effect of furosemide in 14 patients with hyperkalemic distal RTA. In a group of patients with pure selective aldosterone deficiency, furosemide increased net acid and K excretion in a fashion indistinguishable from controls. This effect of furosemide was observed both in the presence and in the absence of acute mineralocorticoid administration. In another group of patients with hyperkalemic distal RTA, furosemide failed to decrease urine pH and to increase net acid excretion despite acute mineralocorticoid administration. Plasma aldosterone was variable in this group in that some patients had appropriate levels of aldosterone for the degree of hyperkalemia, whereas in the other patients the levels were low. The failure of these patients to respond to furosemide, despite pharmacologic doses of mineralocorticoid, suggests that these patients had a defect in H+ secretion other than that attributable to aldosterone deficiency alone. To gain insight into the mechanism whereby furosemide increases urinary acidification, we studied control and amiloride-treated rats pretreated with mineralocorticoid. In response to furosemide, control rats had a significantly lower urine pH and higher net acid and K excretion than that observed in amiloride-treated rats. These data suggest that furosemide increases H+ and K excretion, at least in part, by creating a favorable electric gradient for secretion of these ions since these effects were blunted in presence of inhibition of distal Na transport by amiloride.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,7944681,0,Are patients receiving amiodarone at increased risk for cardiac operations?,"Amiodarone therapy has been implicated as a risk factor for cardiothoracic surgical procedures. In patients undergoing map-guided surgical procedures for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia, we compared the perioperative course of those receiving long-term amiodarone therapy (n = 36) versus that in those not receiving the drug (n = 31). The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex, presenting symptoms, functional class, extent of coronary artery disease, presence of a ventricular aneurysm, technique of ventricular tachycardia ablation, cross-clamp or pump time, the number of vessels grafted, the operative fluid balance, and a need for intraaortic balloon pump or inotropic agent support. In 5 patients receiving amiodarone, epinephrine was required to maintain a normal systemic vascular resistance and adequate arterial pressure. Postoperatively, 6 patients (17%) on amiodarone therapy suffered acute respiratory failure. In spite of aggressive therapy, 3 of these patients died. Only 1 patient not receiving amiodarone died of a stroke. We conclude that amiodarone therapy in patients undergoing open heart operations is associated with an increased risk of severe pulmonary complications (p = 0.03 by Fisher's exact test). Amiodarone therapy should be withheld in patients with ventricular tachycardia until they have been assessed as candidates for possible surgical intervention."

We investigated clinical factors determining cardiac function in patients with adrenal CS. Fifty patients with adrenal CS were studied. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on their NYHA classification and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings: group A with NYHA grade 0 and normal ECG, group B with NYHA grade I and abnormal ECG, and group C with NYHA grade II or higher. Clinical and echocardiographic findings were compared between the groups. Heart failure of grade I or higher was seen in 40% and grade II or higher was seen in 8% of the patients. Age, HbA1c, and prevalence of diabetes mellitus were positively correlated and serum potassium levels were negatively correlated with the severity of cardiac dysfunction. Decreased ejection fraction (EF) and the ratio of the peak to late transmittal filling velocities (E/A), and increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were frequently observed. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that serum potassium and HbA1c levels were independent factors contributing to EF, while serum potassium and cortisol levels were independent factors contributing to LVMI. These results clearly demonstrated that hypokalemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypercortisolemia are the major contributing factors to cardiac dysfunction in adrenal CS. Strict control of these conditions is warranted for the prevention of cardiac dysfunction in adrenal CS."

CD009647,0,8970859,0,The institutionalized elderly: dry to the bone!,"The fluid intake of 57 elderly male and female patients, drawn from psychogeriatric, long-term care and geriatric admission units, was monitored. The fluid intake was determined by direct observation and recording of fluids consumed by each subject over three 24-hour periods. In all cases, regardless of the unit, level of dependency, cognitive or continence status, elderly patients received considerably less fluid than the recommended daily intake of 2000-2500 ml. In the case of patients who were cognitively impaired, dependent and incontinent, fluid intake was less than patients who did not have these impediments. Forty-seven nurses, working on the three units, completed a self-administered questionnaire on the fluid needs of elderly patients. Generally, nurses' knowledge was inadequate in a number of areas such as the signs and complications of dehydration and the fluid requirements of the elderly. A study of this size does not permit general conclusions to be drawn. Nonetheless, if the results are indicative of current practice, nurses do not have a good knowledge of the fluid needs of the elderly, and the low level of fluid intake constitutes a form of neglect."
CD009647,0,6344606,0,Association of hyponatremia with increased renin activity in chronic congestive heart failure: impact of diuretic therapy.,"A correlation between hyponatremia and increased plasma renin activity (PRA) has been reported in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), implying both clinical and pathophysiologic significance. To determine the impact of diuretic therapy on this relation, we evaluated the correlation of serum sodium, prerenal azotemia (blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio [BUN/Cr] ), and PRA in 44 patients with severe CHF who were maintained on diuretic therapy. Serum sodium level was inversely related to PRA (r = -0.389, p less than 0.02). However, a significant correlation also existed between the BUN/Cr ratio and PRA (r = 0.365, p less than 0.025) and an inverse correlation between serum sodium level and the BUN/Cr ratio (r = 0.332, p less than 0.025). Multiple regression analysis of the 3 variables yielded significant interdependence (p less than 0.01). To evaluate the effect of diuretic therapy, 12 patients with severe CHF discontinued diuretic therapy and received, for 1 week each, 10 and 100 mEq sodium diets in balance studies. PRA ranged from 0.14 to 16 ng/ml/h. Despite this range, there was no significant correlation between either serum sodium or BUN/Cr ratio and PRA. It is concluded that the presence of marked hyponatremia and prerenal azotemia in patients with diuretic-treated CHF may suggest increased PRA. However, substantial patient-to-patient variability limits the predictive value of these correlations. Although some clinical value may be derived from such correlations, they should not be used to draw major inferences regarding the severity of CHF or the pathophysiology of water balance in CHF."

Energy value of the diet must be not less than 9375-10,450 kJ bearing in mind glucose administered intravenously. Choice of the anesthetic method which has the least negative influence on carbohydrate metabolism and hemostasis as a whole is analyzed.

CD009647,0,2589532,0,Responses to dehydration and rehydration during heat exposure in young and older men.,"Body temperature, plasma responses, and subjective ratings of thirst and hotness were studied in 5 older men (OM, 61-67 yr) and 6 younger men (YM, 21-29 yr) during 180-min thermal dehydration and subsequent 60-min rehydration (45 degrees C, 25% relative humidity). Rectal temperature (Tre) increased more rapidly and to a greater magnitude in OM, while average total body sweat rates and chest sweat rates were not significantly different. During dehydration, both OM and YM lost similar body weight (1.52 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.55 +/- 0.22%, mean +/- SE). However, in OM, plasma volume (Pv) decreased (-11.3 +/- 2.8 vs. -4.9 +/- 2.9%), and plasma osmolality (Posm) increased to a greater extent (+5.0 +/- 0.32 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.24 mosmol/kg) compared with YM. On rehydration, OM and YM similarly replaced water debt (46.6 +/- 4.9 vs. 49.0 +/- 3.0%). Within 30 min of drinking, YM had restored Pv and Posm, whereas OM showed slower responses, restoring Posm after 60 min and Pv only after a subsequent 30 min at 25 degrees C. Despite a higher Tre and greater change in Pv and Posm, OM rated themselves less thirsty and not significantly hotter than YM. These findings suggest that aging results in decreased ability to maintain Tre during heat stress and that the mechanisms comprise a combination of alterations in body fluid distribution and perception."

This study examined the effect of dehydration on parotid salivary flow rates. Twelve young and 12 older healthy subjects abstained from food and fluid intake for 24 hrs (dehydration) and then underwent i.v. rehydration proportional to the amount of weight lost. Unstimulated and stimulated parotid flow rates, weight, hematocrit and hemoglobin values were assessed at baseline and 24 hrs, and 1 hr after completion of rehydration. All subjects experienced decreases in weight and increases in hematocrit and hemoglobin during dehydration. I.v. fluids caused weight gain and decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin, demonstrating that subjects were metabolically rehydrated. During dehydration, unstimulated flow rates decreased in young (p < 0.001) and older (p < 0.001) subjects, and stimulated flow rates decreased in young (p > 0.05) and older (p = 0.03) subjects. While flow rates increased with rehydration, they remained lower than baseline levels. No age or gender differences were detected for salivary data. These findings suggest that dehydration may cause decreased parotid flow rates, independent of age in healthy adults."
CD009647,0,7958087,0,[A case of Shy-Drager syndrome complicated with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and incomplete paralysis of bilateral vocal cords].,"A 67-year-old man with SIADH complicated by slowly progressing autonomic failure was described. The patient noticed constipation at the age of 57. In the following years, he suffered from urinary incontinence, depletion of sweating, impotence, sleeplessness with snore, and dizziness while walking. Physical examination revealed a masked oily face with slight cerebellar disturbance. Abnormality of autonomic function tests was recognized and he was diagnosed as Shy-Drager syndrome with gradually progressing, diffuse autonomic failure accompanied by slight cerebellar ataxia and Parkinsonism. Both serum sodium level and plasma osmotic pressure were reduced, whereas daily sodium excretion was more than 100mEq and urinary osmolality was about 500mOsm/kgH2O. His renal function was intact, and the adrenocortical and thyroid hormone levels were normal, then criteria of SIADH was fulfilled. SIADH was thought to have occurred on the basis of Shy-Drager syndrome. Water load test showed failure of adequate water diuresis, but intravenous phenytoin administration following the water load test ameliorated the diuresis to normal. The relationship between plasma osmolality and the ADH response indicates that ADH was adequately secreted in response to the increase in plasma osmolality but not suppressed in response to the decrease in plasma osmolality below 280mOsm/kgH2O. These results suggest that ADH synthesis in the hypothalamus and its secretion from the pituitary gland were both intact. The response of ADH secretion to the orthostatic hypotension induced by head-up tilt was quite blunted, being compatible with Shy-Drager Syndrome. Sleep disturbance was studied by polysomnography and laryngoscopy, and was revealed to be based upon severe sleep apnea due to incomplete paralysis of the bilateral vocal cords. Sleep apnea due to vocal cord paralysis is sometimes found to be complicated in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) including Shy-Drager syndrome, and is known as Gerhardt syndrome. This is the first report on a case of Shy-Drager syndrome complicated with SIADH and bilateral vocal cord paralysis. In this case, SIADH is caused by impaired afferent pathways from baroreceptors to the hypothalamus, which transfer inhibitory stimuli on ADH secretion. It is suggested that Shy-Drager syndrome should be considered one of the causes of SIADH."
CD009647,0,16380671,0,Unusual presentation of hypophysitis preceding an empty sella in a 75-year-old woman.,"A 75-year-old woman complained about progressing fatigue. She appeared somnolent, but fully oriented and in no acute distress. Her face was pale and puffy. She did not show any signs of focal neurological disease, and the remainder of the physical examination was unrevealing. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable except for hyponatremia and mildly decreased levels of free T3 and free T4, with TSH in the normal range. Pituitary function tests demonstrated secondary adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unmasked hypophysitis with the characteristic findings of homogeneous gadolinium uptake of the pituitary and a prominent pituitary stalk ('dural tail sign', arrows in Fig. 1 A and B, sagittal and coronal views). Substitution of hydrocortisone and levothyroxine resulted in rapid and sustained improvement of all symptoms and normalisation of laboratory findings. MRI abnormalities normalized within the following six months. At follow-up three years later, MRI signs had further regressed and demonstrated an empty sella (Fig. 2 A and B)."
CD009647,0,16219059,0,Automatic feedback control of relative blood volume changes during hemodialysis improves blood pressure stability during and after dialysis.,"Automatic feedback systems have been designed to control relative blood volume changes during hemodialysis (HD) as hypovolemia plays a major role in the development of dialysis hypotension. Of these systems, one is based on the concept of blood volume tracking (BVT). BVT has been shown to improve intra-HD hemodynamic stability. We first questioned whether BVT also improves post-HD blood pressure stability in hypotension-prone patients and second, whether BVT is effective in reducing the post-HD weight as many hypotension-prone patients are overhydrated because of an inability to reach dry weight. After a 3-week period on standard HD, 12 hypotension-prone patients were treated with two consecutive BVT treatment protocols. During the first BVT period of 3 weeks, the post-HD target weight was kept identical compared with the standard HD period (BVT-constant weight; BVT-cw). During the second BVT period of 6 weeks, we gradually tried to lower the post-HD target weight (BVT-reduced weight; BVT-rw). In the last week of each period, we studied intra-HD and 24 hr post-HD blood pressure behavior by ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM). Pre- and post-HD weight did not differ between standard HD and either BVT-cw or BVT-rw. Heart size on a standing pre-dialysis chest X-ray did not change significantly throughout the study. There were less episodes of dialysis hypotension during BVT compared with standard HD (both BVT periods: p<0.01). ABPM data were complete in 10 patients. During the first 16 hr post-HD, systolic blood pressure was significantly higher with BVT in comparison with standard HD (both BVT periods: p<0.05). The use of BVT in hypotension-prone patients is associated with higher systolic blood pressures for as long as 16 hr post-HD. BVT was not effective in reducing the post-HD target weight in this patient group."
CD009647,0,14695699,0,[The significance of urine sodium measurement after furosemide administration in diuretics-unresponsive patients with liver cirrhosis].,"The diagnosis of refractory ascites means a poor prognosis for patients with liver cirrhosis. The definition of refractory ascites has already been established, but using the dosage of diuretics that correlates with the definition of refractory ascites in an out-patient department will lower the compliance of the patient, as well as causing serious complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy and hyponatremia, as the dosage of diuretics is increased. Due to this fact, it is very difficult to apply this definition of refractory ascites to patients in a domestic out-patient department. In this study, in situations where there are difficulties in applying the diuretics dosage according to definition of refractory ascites, we tried to find out whether measuring the value of urine sodium after the administration of intravenous furosemide can be the standard in early differentiation of the response to diuretics treatment."
CD009647,0,7890906,0,A comparison of skinfold anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance analysis for measuring percentage body fat in patients with cirrhosis.,"Percentage body fat was determined by skinfold anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance analysis in 60 patients with cirrhosis, 30 of whom had overt fluid retention, and in 60 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. In the control population the mean +/- 1SD percentage body fat assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis, 22.6 +/- 6.5%, and skinfold anthropometry, 22.5 +/- 6.9%, were comparable. However, there was considerable variation in individual values such that measurements made using bioelectrical impedance analysis could be from 9% less to 8% more than the corresponding anthropometric values. In patients with cirrhosis the mean percentage body fat assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis, 24.4 +/- 8.9%, was significantly greater than the value obtained using skinfold anthropometry, 20.3 +/- 8.4% (p < 0.01) for the whole group and for the subgroup of patients with fluid retention, 24.5 +/- 8.5% cf. 18.4 +/- 7.1% (p < 0.005); estimates of body fat in the subgroup of patients without overt fluid retention were comparable between methods, 24.4 +/- 9.4% cf. 22.1 +/- 9.2%. In the whole patient group individual measurements made using bioelectrical impedance analysis could be from 10% less to 18% more than the corresponding anthropometric values; similar degrees of variation in individual values were observed in the two patient subgroups. Bioelectrical impedance analysis should not be used interchangeably with skinfold anthropometry for assessment of percentage body fat in patients with cirrhosis, irrespective of their state of hydration."
CD009647,0,11774726,0,[Can sleep urine calcium concentration corrected by osmolality as a screening test identify subjects with risk to develop osteoporosis?].,"The reliability of overnight (sleep) urine (SU) and 2nd morning urine (2MU) were compared with that of 24-hour urine (24 U) for the evaluation of bone resorption markers. A total of 50 women were subjected to the study was were divided into two groups according to their lumbar bone mineral density, namely 25 females with normal BMD (mean age 47) and 25 women with low BMD (mean age 78). Calcium (Ca), collagen degradation products crosslaps (CTx), pyridinoline (Pyr) and deoxypyridinoline (D-Pyr) were measured in 24 U, SU and 2MU and corrected for urine volume with creatinine (Cr) and osmolality(Osm). Among these four components, the corrected values tended to be higher in SU than 2MU, regardless of the method of correction and BMD level. Ca, CTx, Pyr and D-Pyr concentrations in spot urine were always significantly correlated with total excretion/body weight (Kg) regardless of the method of correction and BMD level. In low BMD subjects, Ca, CTx and D-Pyr concentrations corrected by Osm with further correction by body weight as an index of body size in the SU were significantly correlated with BMD. The SU may be a sensitive indicator of augmented nighttime bone resorption replacing 24 U especially on correction by Osm to eliminate the influence of sodium intake as an extraskeletal factor. In 51 women with normal BMD (A) with a mean age of 56, 16 with osteopenia (B) with a mean age of 64 and 35 with osteoporosis (C) with a mean age of 71, correlation coefficients were calculated between lumbar BMD and Ca/Osm, Ca/Osm/Kg, Ca/Cr and Ca/Cr/Kg in SU. Although no significant difference of mean urine Ca values were found between A and B groups, Ca values in C were significantly higher than that of A regardless of the correction method. The mean value of Ca/Osm/Kg in C was significantly higher than that of B. Ca/Osm/Kg showed a significant negative correlation with BMD in C. On examination of the correlation between % change of BMD in 23 women with a mean age of 59 and Ca concentration in SU corrected by urine volume and body weight, Ca/Osm was -0.427 (p = 0.0419), Ca/Osm/Kg -0.450 (p = 0.0313), Ca/Cr -0.400 (p = 0.058) and Ca/Cr/Kg -0.420 (p = 0.0462), suggesting the usefulness of Ca/Osm/Kg as an indicator of low BMD in screening."
CD009647,0,15244071,0,Baroreflex control of the heart rate during central hypovolemic stress in young and elderly men.,"To test the hypothesis that tolerance to central hypovolemic stress is diminished with a reduced sensitivity of cardiac baroreflex in young and old men, twenty-four healthy elderly male subjects (67.5+/-0.9 yrs) and 24 young male subjects (22.4+/-0.4 yrs) underwent a 21 min bout of ramped lower body negative pressure (LBNP) (0 to -60 mmHg, 10 mmHg each for 3 min). Heart rate(HR), blood pressure, thoracic impedance (Z0) and calf circumference were measured throughout the experimental period. The sensitivity (BRS) of arterial baroreflex control of the cardiac interval was calculated from spontaneous changes in beat-to-beat arterial pressure and the RR interval during the LBNP test. The occurrence of presyncope episodes during LBNP was 16.7% in elderly subjects and 37.5% in young subjects. The changes of HR, blood pressure, Z0 and calf circumference in the young (Young fainter group) and the elderly (Elderly fainter group) subjects who showed presyncope during LBNP did not differ from those in the subjects (Young and Elderly nonfainter groups) who did not show presyncope. The steady-state HR responses to the changes of Z0 during LBNP did not differ among the four groups. In young and elderly subjects, the baseline values of BRS in the fainter groups tended to be smaller than those in the nonfainter groups, and the difference in the young group was significant (P<0.05). No LBNP-related change of BRS was observed in elderly subjects, whereas a gradual LBNP-related decrease was observed in young subjects. These findings suggest that 1) aging does not increase intolerance to central hypovolemic stress induced by a given LBNP, 2) the reduced vagal BRS is related partly to low LBNP tolerance in young and elderly men."
CD009647,0,16432113,0,Perioperative circulating blood volume and cardiac function in valve disease.,"Circulating blood volume is important in managing fluid balance and cardiac function after surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass. Appropriate management differs among the valve disorders, but perioperative blood volume has not yet been considered. From February 2001 to March 2003, perioperative blood volume, fluid balance, cardiac index, and left ventricular stroke work index were measured in 31 patients: 10 with aortic stenosis, 9 with aortic regurgitation, 3 with mitral stenosis, and 9 with mitral regurgitation. All immediate postoperative blood volume measurements were less than preoperative values, and gradually returned to baseline. At all time points, blood volume in patients with aortic or mitral regurgitation was high, whereas it was low in those with stenosis, especially mitral stenosis. Fluid balance was positive in all patients. Postoperatively, there was a positive correlation between cardiac index and blood volume in all groups. The left ventricular stroke work index in the mitral regurgitation group was significantly higher than other groups, the aortic stenosis group was slightly lower, the mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation groups were higher than the baseline, and the aortic regurgitation group was essentially unchanged. Thus, it is necessary to consider blood volume perioperatively in different valvular diseases to manage water balance."
CD009647,0,20653713,0,Use of BNP and bioimpedance to drive therapy in heart failure patients.,"The aim of the study was to verify whether the bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) could be a valid methodology to assess the fluid overload, whether there was a correlation between brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and the fluid overload detected by BIVA, and whether this technique could be a valid guide in the management of the therapy in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). A total of 51 patients arriving to the emergency department of the University Hospital Sant'Andrea (Rome, Italy) from December 2008 to April 2009 were enrolled. Hydration state, BNP, and caval index were evaluated at admission in the emergency department, at 24 and 72 hours, and at discharge. Vascular pedicle width was evaluated at admission and at discharge. BIVA values were correlated with BNP levels. A follow-up by phone at 3 months was performed. ADHF patients showed higher values of hydration state compared with controls. In ADHF patients, the difference between t 0 and t 72 BIVA mean values (P<.001) and between t 0 and discharge BIVA mean value (P<.0001) was statistically significant. Vascular pedicle width in ADHF patients showed a statistically significant difference (P<.0004) in compared with vascular pedicle width in controls."
CD009647,0,14618479,0,Body composition during normal pregnancy: reference ranges.,"Maternal body composition undergoes a deep adaptative change during the course of pregnancy. Fat mass, fat-free mass, and total body water (TBW) increase in different ways and their effects on pregnancy outcome represent a field of major interest in perinatal medicine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in maternal body composition [maternal weight, TBW, intracellular water (ICW) and extracellular water (ECW)] during healthy pregnancy by using bioimpedance analysis (BIA). A total of 170 healthy pregnant women, aged 22-44 years, volunteered to participate in our study. The BIA measurements were carried out with a Tefal BIA scale determining resistance and reactance. Lukaski's multiple-regression equation was used to estimate TBW and ICW and ECW were computed using the prediction formula of Segal. The evaluations were performed at 10-38 weeks' gestation, every 3-4 weeks, and hematocrit was determined at every time interval. Analysis of variance and multiple comparisons of Bonferroni were performed to compare variables among the different study intervals. Second-order polynomial interpolation was used to obtain percentile values for each bioimpedance parameter. Percentile bioimpedance values of the healthy population are provided at each study time, by showing the mean value and the 5th, 25th, 75th, 95th percentiles. Moreover, normal reference ranges for TBW are provided for each gestational age, in relation to maternal weight gain. Reactance, TBW, and ICW enhance slightly during the course of gestation. Tetrapolar BIA could be an easy and practical tool for evaluating changes of maternal body components during pregnancy. It could also provide indirect proof of the normal hemodilution occurring in normal pregnancies. Moreover, fat mass deposition, and not only fluid retention, seems to be responsible for the mother's gestational weight gain, since reactance is an indirect parameter in estimating fat mass amount."
CD009647,0,20661209,0,Systolic anterior motion causing hemodynamic instability and pulmonary edema during bleeding.,"Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of mitral valve is the prolapse of a mitral leaflet into the left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) during systole, causing LVOT obstruction and mitral valve regurgitation. We report the case of a patient who developed SAM-induced hemodynamic instability during bleeding with a clinical picture resembling pulmonary edema. A 77-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency room for abdominal bleeding in polycystic renal disease. Upon arrival, she was normotensive, despite being anuric and acidotic. After infusion of fluids and packed red blood cells (total 3 680 mL in 6 hours) she developed atrial fibrillation and clinical and radiological signs of pulmonary edema. Sedation and non-invasive ventilation brought to immediate severe hypotension. A transesophageal echocardiogram showed an ""empty"" hypertrophic hypercontractile left ventricle, SAM with LVOT obstruction (intraventricular gradient 154 mmHg) and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. With further fluid infusion hemodynamic stability and sinus rhythm were recovered. SAM, LVOT obstruction and mitral regurgitation disappeared. SAM is a rare but dangerous cause of hemodynamic instability. It has been described in patients with and without left ventricular hypertrophy, in presence of hypovolemia and sympathetic stimulation. In our case it presented with a misleading clinical picture of pulmonary edema simulating fluid overload in an actually hypovolemic patient. In fact, SAM-associated mitral regurgitation together with diastolic dysfunction and tachycardia induced a pulmonary edema whose treatment worsened hypovolemia and precipitated LVOT obstruction and hypotension. Further fluid infusion was resolutive. Echocardiography was fundamental for diagnosis and treatment."

CD009647,0,731936,0,Role of renin-angiotensin system in the controls of blood pressure and aldosterone in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.,"In an attempt to evaluate the role of renin-angiotensin system in the contols of blood pressure and aldosterone secretion in the patients with cirrhosis and asictes, 7 patients were infused of an antagonist of angiotensin II, Sar-1 Ile-8 angiotensin II, intravenously to inhibit the action of renin-angiotensin system and to observe changes in arterial pressure and plasma aldosterone. In 1 patient with recent onset of severe ascites and high plasma renin activity, blood pressure and plasma aldosterone decreased during the infusion. In contrast, mild rise in blood pressure and various changes in plasma aldosterone were observed in the other 6 patients with normal plasma renin activity. These results suggest variable angiotensin dependency in the controls of blood pressure and plasma aldosterone in the patients with cirrhosis and ascites according to the stage of the disease, the states of sodium and water balance and/or palasma renin activity."

The average age was 56 years. Preoperatively, the average blood pressure (BP) was 211/123 mm Hg. The standard operation was aortorenal bypass, associated with resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in three cases. Four patients had nephrectomy. Most patients were referred after failure of a previous renal revascularization procedure. In three patients, most of the renal arterial system was thrombotic. All patients had preoperative Swan-Ganz catheter placement for monitoring of fluid balance, filling pressure, and cardiac output. Intravenous vasodilators were used to control BP and to reduce the afterload on the left ventricle. There were no operative deaths. The average postoperative BP was 136/81 mm Hg. Three patients had improvement in renal function, and one was able to stop hemodialysis after operation. Because of a low mortality and overall satisfactory results, patients with atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension should be considered for vascular reconstruction."

CD009647,0,12056516,0,"Nutritional status in peritoneal dialysis: studies in body composition, lipoprotein metabolism and peritoneal function.","This thesis is based on clinical studies including virtually all patients treated with peritoneal dialysis in Gothenburg during the 1990s. The patients had a fundamentally altered body composition compared to healthy subjects, characterised by a reduction in body cell mass and body fat already at start of dialysis. During PD treatment. a further decrease in body cell mass was observed. Energy stores tended to normalise during the first years of treatment and remained constant thereafter, or declined subsequently. Extracellular water, calculated from the four-compartment model, was increased when patients started PD treatment and increased further, in parallel to the reduction in body cell mass. These alterations were seen in combination with a normal. or slightly reduced, body weight. Standard methods of assessing nutritional status may therefore not be valid in the dialysis population. Prediction equations to estimate total body water, used in measurements of dialysis adequacy, give erroneous results in PD patients, as shown in a study on our PD population. This may have important clinical consequences, especially in wasted patients. Reduced muscle mass is a marker of protein-energy malnutrition, and therefore simple and reliable methods to measure muscle mass are warranted. When lean body mass was calculated from creatinine generation rate and compared to lean body mass estimated from measurements of total body potassium. the agreement between the two methods was low. Furthermore, when repeated measurements of creatinine generation rate were performed, the variation coefficient was unacceptably high. Thus. creatinine generation rate cannot be recommended as a method to evaluate somatic protein status in PD patients. The lipoprotein metabolic derangements are pronounced in PD patients. in which a further increase in cholesterol and cholesterol-rich apoB-containing lipoproteins are added to the already pre-existing renal dyslipidemia. characterised by increased concentration of triglycerides and triglyceride-rich complex lipoproteins. There are indications that dialytic variables may influence this development. When peritoneal function was assessed by the Peritoneal Dialysis Capacity test at start of dialysis, it was observed that peritoneal function reflected patient characteristics and co-morbidity. Patients with systemic disease had enhanced diffusion capacity compared to patients with primary renal disorders. Furthermore, in patients with more severe co-morbidity. peritoneal protein losses were increased. Finally, elderly patients had ultrafiltration conditions that were different from those of younger patients. Peritoneal function remained essentially stable during medium-long term follow up. Body composition features in dialysis patients are similar to those seen in severe disease in general. Thus, it is difficult to separate the effects of malnutrition from the effects of the underlying disease. Specific standards for nutritional status adapted for patients with renal failure are required."

CD009647,0,11350271,0,"Fluid balance in patients with chronic renal failure assessed with N-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide, atrial natriuretic peptide and ultrasonography.","The N-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide (proANP) has become an important parameter for assessing the prognosis of patients with cardiac disease. Its use for evaluating the hydration status in patients with chronic renal failure, however, is still under investigation. The present study comprised 12 haemodialysis (HD) and 17 pre-dialysis patients. In the HD patients, the inferior vena cava diameter during quiet expiration (IVCe) was estimated by ultrasonography and plasma concentrations of N-terminal proANP, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were measured before and 4 h after termination of HD. In the pre-dialysis patients venous blood samples were taken during rest to measure plasma N-terminal proANP and ANP and serum creatinine. Normal values for N-terminal proANP and ANP were obtained from 18 healthy volunteers. The plasma concentrations of N-terminal proANP and ANP in healthy volunteers were 328 +/- 92 and 11.4.0 +/- 3.1 pM L-1, respectively. In pre-dialysis patients, serum creatinine ranged from 110 to 447 microM L-1 and was significantly correlated to plasma N-terminal proANP (r = 0.60, P < 0.05) but not to ANP. This may indicate that N-terminal proANP is more dependent on renal function for its clearance than ANP, which is probably cleared by extrarenal mechanisms as well. In HD patients, IVCe was significantly correlated to the three hormones before HD, most strongly to N-terminal proANP. After dialysis, IVCe was significantly correlated to ANP and cGMP but was not correlated to N-terminal proANP. This may suggest that proANP takes a longer time than other hormones to reflect changes in intravascular volume. In conclusion, N-terminal proANP is a hormone closely related to degree of renal function. Furthermore, it is a sensitive marker reflecting the interdialytic hydration status in HD patients, as indicated by its high correlation to IVCe, a standard method which is used frequently nowadays to assess the body hydration. However N-terminal proANP could not reflect the acute changes in fluid volume induced by HD, probably because it is slowly metabolized."

I.v. fluid and blood were administered in an excess of 3.18 (1.38-9.35) 1 during the operation. TI2.5 decreased from 51.7 (39.2-66.4) to 34.9 (21.1-45.7) ohm (P = 0.001), while TI100 decreased from 41.9 (31.4-55.0) to 30.3 (18.3-40.8) ohm (P = 0.002). CVP, 6 (3-11) mmHg [0.8 (0.4-1.5) kPa], was the same before and after surgery. Temperature decreased during cardiopulmonary bypass from 35.4 (34.1-36.6) to 26.7 (22.9-31.0) degrees C and haematocrit from 39 (34-46)% to a lowest value of 27 (23-32)% (P = 0.0001). A close linear correlation between TI and body fluid balance was observed (TI2.5: r = -0.96, TI100: r = -0.95, P = 0.0001). Corrections of TI for temperature and/or haematocrit improved the correlation between TI and fluid balance to 0.99 (TI2.5) and 0.98 (TI100). The data indicate that changes in thoracic impedance can be used to monitor body fluid balance during cardiac surgery."
CD009647,0,9796373,0,Nifedipine and extracellular water in dialysis arterial hypertension.,"Nifedipine is a Ca-antagonist drug that reduces contractility of vascular smooth muscle, and is used in the treatment of arterial hypertension and of stable and vasospastic angina. Aim of this study is to evaluate long-term effect of nifedipine on distribution of body fluid compartment, assessed by BIA (Bio-Impedance Analysis), and on cardiac function, in hypertensive patients on dialysis. Two groups of hypertensive patients were compared: a) a first group of nine patients (5 Male, 4 Female; age 62.67 +/- 10.39) treated with nifedipine (30 mg/day) for one year; b) a control group of sixteen dialysis patients (9 Male, 7 Female; age 56.31 +/- 14.44), previously hypertensive, with normal blood pressure without anti-hypertensive drugs for three months or more. By BIA, extracellular water percentage (ECW%) is higher in nifedipine-treated patients (p < 0.001) in comparison with the control group before dialysis; no other difference is present. The intradialytical variations (before dialysis vs. the end of dialysis) of body fluid compartments are a significant decrease of total body water % (52.33 +/- 2.89 vs. 48.72 +/- 3.35, p < 0.001), ECW% (40.97 +/- 2.2 vs. 37.56 +/- 3.47, p < 0.005), Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Volume (81.1 +/- 14.6 vs. 63.4 +/- 21.66 ml/m2, p < 0.003), Cardiac Output (3.35 +/- 0.71 vs. 2.51 +/- 0.76 l/min/m2, p < 0.04) and Stroke Volume (45.76 +/- 10.21 vs. 34.34 +/- 9.98 ml/m2, p < 0.02) in nifedipine-treated patients. Our findings suggest that nifedipine induces intermittent and prolonged expansion of extra-cellular volume. This condition, in patients otherwise without clinical and echocardiographic signs of heart failure, can be potentially detrimental for cardiac function on long-term nifedipine treatment."

CD009647,0,7206083,0,Decreases in electric thoracic impedance during transurethral resection of the prostate: an index of early water intoxication.,"Thoracic impedance of 18 patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate was measured 15 minutes preoperatively, and 30 and 60 minutes after the start of the operation. Impedance variations were compared to variation in 1) cardiac output, 2) serum sodium osmolality and 3) alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference. Thoracic impedance, initially 24.6 plus or minus 0.3, decreased to 23.8 plus or minus 0.5, 30 minutes after the onset of the operation (p less than 0.0005) and 22.9 plus or minus 0.5, 30 minutes later (p less than 0.01 from previous reading and 0.0005 from control). Patients in whom impedance had decreased 10 per cent or more from control values received 10 mg. furosemide intravenously 60 minutes after the onset of the operation. This therapy permitted the restoration of impedance values, cardiac output, alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference and serum sodium osmolality to values statistically similar to those found in the 10 patients who had not sustained such precipitous decreases in impedance within 60 minutes. We believe that the measurement of thoracic impedance during transurethral prostatic surgery offers the most sensitive index of early water intoxication. Measurements can be obtained without delay in the operating room and, thus, permit immediate correction of the condition."

CD009647,0,17077527,0,Skin penetration flux and lag-time of steroids across hydrated and dehydrated human skin in vitro.,"To study the effect of hydration on skin absorption, we investigated penetration across human skin of twelve model chemicals having steroidal structure but different molecular weight and compared the steady-state penetration rate (J) and lag-time (t) across hydration intact skin (Jh and th) with that across dehydrated intact skin (Jd and td). Stratum corneum (SC) thickness of hydrated (52 microm) is 3.3 times that of dehydrated skin (16 microm). Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) of hydrated (7.6+/-2.1 g/m2/h) is twice that of dehydrated skin (3.4+/-1.6 g/m2/h, p<0.05) which are similar to in vivo values, suggesting the SC barrier function was recovered. The ratio of Jh/Jd ranged between 0.7 and 3.6 (average of 1.9). On the other hand, the ratio of th/td was almost constant (average of 0.8). Ratios of Jh/Jd and th/td were independent of MW and Ko/w. In percutaneous absorption experiments in vitro, skin was preserved in culture medium until use and SC might swell during that time. Therefore, we consider the possibility that J and t varied between hydrated and dehydrated skin. We confirmed the difference of J and t between hydrated and dehydrated skin in vitro and now need to define these results under in vivo condition."

The effect of alkaline soap and syndet on dry skin in elderly, non-atopic patients.","Clinical dryness of the skin is a common problem among elderly, dermatological patients. In the present investigation, hydration, surface lipids, skin pH and water barrier function as expressed by the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were studied in both dry and normal skin. Using these parameters, a comparison of the local effects of acid and alkaline cleansing products was made. In non-atopic elderly patients with dry skin, the TEWL values were lower than in the younger control group but higher than in the older controls. Following one week's topical therapy, the TEWL values in the patient group decreased further and approached the lower values of the older control group. At the same time the skin hydration values increased, indicating a beneficial effect on the skin barrier. An inverse relationship was demonstrated between TEWL and skin hydration. The study indicates that high TEWL values are frequently correlated with high pH, low hydration of the stratum corneum and reduced skin surface lipid content. Despite the intensive use of an acid syndet and lotion, the pH-readings increased but were still within the 'confidence limits' of the control groups."

CD009647,0,7301002,0,Effects of frusemide in chronic renal failure.,"The present study was designed to refute or confirm the postulate that the use of high dose frusemide in chronic renal failure will increase the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 7 patients in stable chronic renal failure were admitted to hospital for 20 days. For 10 days fluid balance was maintained and no diuretics given. During the next 10 days, a gram of frusemide was given orally, with fluid and electrolyte replacement based on the 24-hour urine collections which were made throughout the 20-day period. Daily estimations of sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine and osmolality were made on plasma and urine. The excretion of water (p less than 0.01), sodium (p less than 0.01) and potassium (p less than 0.05) increased significantly during the treatment period. There was no significant change in blood pressure, weight, creatinine clearance (C/CR), clearance of urea (C/Urea), total urea and creatinine excretion, serum sodium, potassium or osmolality. The results demonstrate that a gram of frusemide, administered to patients in stable chronic renal failure, does not have any effect on intrinsic renal function. However, there was a significant increase in urine volume, as well as sodium and potassium excretion."

CD009647,0,7805462,0,Combined therapy of captopril and spironolactone for refractory congestive heart failure.,"It is traditionally considered that angiotensin--converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and spironolactone could not be used simultaneously because of the assumed risk of hyperkalemia. However, despite ACEI therapy edema and congestive status remain in some of the patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). In order to seek an effective therapy for these patients, we observed the efficacy and safety of captopil plus spironolactone in patients with refractory CHF, with strict monitoring of renal function, serum and urine electrolytes and blood pressure (BP). Thirty-five patients with refractory CHF and New York Heart Association functional class IV without renal dysfunction, hypotension and hyperkalemia, whose plasma aldosterone (ALD) level in 88.6% of them was above normal value, were randomly assigned to group A (n = 16, captopril alone) and B (n = 19, captopril plus spironolactone) for a 4-week treatment. The dosage of both drugs was individually adjusted in time according to the results of serum potassium and renal function. The improvement in dyspnea--fatigue ratings, urinary volume and Na+/K+ ratio in group B was more significant than that in group A, and the plasma ALD level in group B decreased obviously while it remained high in group A after therapy. Two patients in group B who had had normal plasma ALD level with urinary Na+/K+ ratio > 1.0 before the therapy did not exhibit any clinical improvement. A strong negative correlation was found between plasma ALD level and urinary Na+/K+ ratio (correlation coefficient -0.689, P < 0.01). None of the patients had obvious hyperkalemia and hypoaldosteronism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,15852666,0,[Efficacy of intranasal desmopressin in the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria].,"Older adults often cite nocturia as one of the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). We investigated the efficacy and safety of intranasal desmopressin in the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria on 12 patients (ten men, two women) ranging in age from 53 to 77 years (mean 67 years). All patients experienced more than two episodes of nocturia per night, and had a nocturnal urine volume greater than 35% of the daily voided volume, measured using a 3-day voiding diary with a frequency-volume chart. They began taking intranasal desmopressin (10 microg) at bedtime. When compared with the baseline data, the nocturnal urine volume, (928 +/- 307 versus 469 +/- 251 ml, p = 0.0007) and nocturnal frequency (4.8 +/- 2.0 versus 2.8 +/- 1.8, p = 0.0009) were significantly decreased. The daytime urine volume (1,008 +/- 458 versus 930 +/- 419 ml, p = 0.49) did not change significantly. The unine osmolarity (420 +/- 143 versus 598 +/- 158 mOsm/kg, p = 0.0065), and urine sodium levels (100 +/- 32 versus 140 +/- 60 mEq/l, p = 0.007) increased significantly, whereas the serum sodium levels (141 +/- 3 versus 135 +/- 7 mEq/l, p = 0.048) decreased significantly. Among the 12 patients, 5 (41.6%) patients reported side effects, including headache in 1, edema in 1 and hyponatremia in 3. The patient with edema discontinued medication, but the other 4 patients continued their medication and the side effects subsided. In conclusion, desmopressin is an effective treatment for adult patients complaining of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria. One should be aware of the potential side effects including hyponatremia."

The authors recently experienced the case of CN-CD infection with the complication of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in a 83 year old woman. She was admitted to our hospital with the complaints of fever and general fatigue on June 10, 1987. At the time of admission, there were no abnormal findings except a mildly lowered consciousness level on physical examination, there were no abnormal neurological finding nor meningeal signs. Laboratory data revealed a mild leukocytosis and hyponatremia. Chest X-P showed a few small nodular shadows scattered in both lungs. Antibiotics therapy was of no help and hyponatremia became worse. Then with the suspicion of SIADH, Demeclocycline was administered and limitation of water intake was decreased and hyponatremia improvement was used. Yeast-like fungi was detected in the venous blood culture and in the cerebrospinal fluid (cell count: 252/3) CN-CD by India-ink preparation and bacteriological nature were determined. We made a diagnosis of sepsis and meningitis by CN-CD accompanied with SIADH. In spite of Miconazole administration intravenously and intrathecally, she died 2 months after admission. The minimal inhibitory concentration (micrograms/ml) of antibiotics against the isolated CN-CD was as follows: Amphotericin B: 0.78, 5-PC: 1.56, Miconazole less than or equal to 0.05, Nystatin: 25, Ketoconazole: 0.78."

To stress that dextran prophylaxis can be a serious threat to microsurgical patients, the authors report on two more such patients and discuss how to prevent and treat this condition. Hypovolemic patients of older age are at risk, as are patients with cardiovascular diseases, renal artery stenosis, and preexisting renal insufficiency. Dextran should be discontinued promptly in patients with decreased urinary output or with high urine specific gravity. Dextran-induced acute renal failure may be severe and it may last several days.

CD009647,0,8207324,0,Collagen-based drug delivery and artificial tears.,"For patients with conditions requiring chronic rather than acute therapy, the advantages of collagen shields in providing high and sustained levels of drugs and/or lubricants to the cornea are outweighed by the difficulty of insertion of the shield and the problem of blurred vision. We have developed a delivery system in which collagen pieces suspended in a viscous vehicle can be instilled into the lower forniceal space, thereby simplifying application and reducing blurring of vision. The collagen pieces (Collasomes) can be formulated with various constituents such as antibiotics or cyclosporine, or with chemical alterations such as the inclusion of a lipid (Lacrisomes) for the treatment of dry eyes. In the normal eyes of volunteers, Collasomes hydrated in a solution of sodium fluorescein and suspended in a methylcellulose vehicle as a model for delivery of water-soluble drugs produced fluorescein concentrations 17 to 42 times higher in the cornea and 6 to 8 times higher in the aqueous humor, compared with fluorescein-containing vehicle alone. In a preliminary controlled study, 76% of patients with moderately severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) preferred Lacrisomes to the vehicle control because of a more soothing effect and longer duration of comfort. All preparations were well tolerated by all study subjects. Current studies involve improving drug delivery by chemically modifying the collagen molecule to slow diffusion of the drug from the Collasome matrix, as well as varying the amount of cetyl alcohol and combining it with modified collagen in Lacrisomes to maximize comfort in patients with dry eyes."

To determine the relationship between clinical manifestations and abnormalities in tonicity and extracellular volume in such patients, we analyzed 43 episodes of severe dialysis-associated hyperglycemia (serum glucose exceeding 600 mg/dL) treated only with insulin. The main manifestations were dyspnea in 22 cases (pulmonary edema in 19), nausea and vomiting in 15, coma in 13 and seizures in 3, while 5 patients had no symptoms. Treatment with insulin resulted in a decrease in serum glucose value from 913 +/- 197 mg/dL to 170 +/- 78 mg/dL, an increase in serum sodium level from 125 +/- 5 to 136 +/- 5 mmol/L, and a fall in calculated serum tonicity value from 300 +/- 13 to 282 +/- 11 mmol/kg (all at p < 0.001). The ratio of the change in serum sodium level over change in serum glucose concentration was -1.50 +/- 0.22 mmol/L per 100 mg/dL. The percent increase in extracellular volume secondary to hyperglycemia developing from the prior euglycemic state and calculated from changes in serum sodium and chloride concentrations, was 10.9% +/- 4.6% (1.5% +/- 0.6% per 100 mg/dL increase in serum glucose level). All clinical manifestations dissipated after correction of hyperglycemia in 42 patients. One woman developed during treatment a fatal myocardial infarction. Dialysis patients with severe hyperglycemia may develop symptoms as a result of hypertonicity and extracellular expansion. Insulin alone may be sufficient treatment for these symptoms. The changes in serum tonicity and electrolytes during treatment are consistent with theoretical predictions."

Reports of arrhythmogenic effects (torsades de pointes) related to bepridil led to the assembly of a task force of physicians from France and the Netherlands. The task force found that the risk of torsades de pointes was indeed increased in elderly patients, especially women greater than 70 years old, as well as in those taking diuretics, which can precipitate hypokalemia. Postmarketing surveillance data developed from 1981 to 1989 have revealed 108 validated episodes of torsades de pointes in patients treated with bepridil. Improved patient selection has dramatically decreased the incidence of this complication. Several comparative clinical trials assessing the safety of bepridil have concluded that the drug may prolong the QT interval in certain patients; however, no occurrence of torsades de pointes was documented in these safety studies. The 9-year French experience suggests that bepridil is a safe and effective agent for treatment of angina pectoris in properly selected patients."

CD009647,0,11174882,0,Diuretic therapy in congestive heart failure.,"The principal goals of treatment of the patient in heart failure are the relief of their symptoms and improvement in their prognosis. Of all antiheart failure drugs currently available, the diuretics are therapeutically superior in their efficacy in relieving clinical symptoms and signs. Whether administered intravenously or orally, all diuretics result in a substantial reduction in the raised pulmonary vascular pressures in combination with a small reduction in cardiac output. Diuretics stimulate release of renin with subsequent activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, particularly if used in large doses, although their quantitative impact on the neuroendocrine profile at different stages of heart failure remains to be defined. In patients with mild heart failure, diuretics reduce plasma catecholamine concentrations, but their sympatholytic effects in more severe cases are unknown, as are their effects on the metabolically active tissues in these patients. Diuretic resistance can be circumvented by segmental nephron blockade with a combination of low-dose diuretics that simultaneously block sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, the distal tubule, and the collecting duct. Diuretics improve symptoms of breathlessness and signs of peripheral edema in patients with congestive heart failure in direct relationship to the induced diuresis. These benefits are frequently associated with a substantial improvement in patients' appreciation of quality of life and economic capacity. There are few adverse reactions to chronic diuretic therapy, but the serum electrolytes should be monitored for hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. The impact of diuretics on prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure is unknown; however, diuretics have been a major ingredient of the therapies used in all the survival trials with vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blocking drugs. In addition to their clinical benefits, diuretics are the most cost-effective treatment of any single drug group currently available for the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure."

The trial was of a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group design and patients were randomised to once-daily treatment with either donepezil (1, 3 or 5 mg) or placebo. The 12-week double-blind phase was followed by a 2-week single-blind placebo washout. 161 patients (55-85 years of age) entered the study and 141 completed treatment. Patients treated with donepezil showed dose-related improvements in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale score (ADAS-cog) and in MMSF scores. The improvements in ADAS-cog were statistically significantly greater with donepezil 5 mg/day than with placebo. There was a 50% reduction in the percentage of patients showing clinical decline with donepezil at 5 mg/day (11%) relative to placebo (20%). In addition, a statistically significant correlation between plasma concentrations of donepezil and AChE inhibition was demonstrated. A plateau of inhibition (76-84%) was reached at plasma donepezil concentrations > 50 ng/ml. The correlation between plasma drug concentrations and ADAS-cog (p = 0.014), MMSE (p = 0.023) and patient quality of life scores, assessed by the patient (p = 0.037) were also statistically significant, as was the correlation between AChE inhibition and change in ADAS-cog (p = 0.008). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events with all three dosages of donepezil (64-68%) was comparable to that observed with placebo (65%). Donepezil had no clinically significant effect on vital signs, haematology or clinical biochemistry tests.

Dilution analysis, using deuterium oxide and sodium bromide, was also performed on each subject before dialysis so that prediction equations for ECW and TBW based on the MFBIA measures could be developed. These prediction equations were then used to estimate water compartment volume changes during dialysis and compared with volumetric measures of the dialysate removed. The results show that MFBIA does not accurately measure ECW and TBW changes during dialysis. The MFBIA measures tend to overestimate the changes and are not sufficiently precise to be clinically useful."
CD009647,0,2505718,0,[Tolerance and safety of the use of perindopril].,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) constitute an effective and well tolerated class of drugs for the treatment of arterial hypertension. Yet they have been blamed for the occurrence of side-effects the most frequently reported of which are renal function impairment, hypotension and cough. For this reason, the renal function of hypertensive patients has been evaluated after short - and long - term treatment with perindopril. In patients with normal renal function on short-term treatment (1 and 5 days) perindopril produced an increase of renal plasma flow without change in glomerular filtration. In long-term treatment (up to 18 months), no significant change in plasma creatinine level was observed. In old age hypertensive patients or in patients with chronic renal failure glomerular filtration was also preserved, apart from rare cases of creatinine clearance reduction, notably after addition of hydrochlorothiazide. A very slight and clinically not significant rise of kaliemia was noted when perindopril was used as single-drug treatment. Cases of symptomatic hypotension were rare (0.2 p. 100), even in situations of water and salt depletion. Among the other side-effects of ACEI, cough, which has more recently been described, has carefully been looked for. Its incidence has been determined in a double-blind trial comparing perindopril (1.2 p. 100) with captopril (2.4 p. 100). It has also been evaluated in a long-term study involving 632 hypertensive patients, 391 of whom were treated for 1 year; its incidence then was 2.9 p. 100, and drug withdrawal was required in 8 cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The assessments of ECW were compared with patients' weighing results. Whole-body bioimpedance-derived ECW correlated significantly with 51Cr-EDTA dilution-based ECW in the pre-operative period (r=0.74; P<0.005); the bias was 0.2 +/- 1.1 l (+/-SD). In the post-operative period, the agreement between these methods was poor, the bias being 0.5 +/- 2.5 l, and no significant correlation between the methods was found (r=0.38; P>0.05). Whole-body bioimpedance-derived ECW changes correlated significantly with weight changes of the patient induced by the operation (r=0.52; P<0.05). 51Cr-EDTA dilution-based ECW changes correlated neither with weight changes (r=0.33; P>0.05) nor with bioimpedance-derived ECW changes (r=0.03; P>0.05). Alterations in radioisotope tracer distribution and loss of it due to blood leakage in the post-operative period were presumed to explain the discrepancy between dilution technique and weighing results. The results suggest that bioimpedance is a useful non-invasive method for assessment of extracellular volume changes induced by coronary artery bypass grafting operations. 51Cr-EDTA dilution-based ECW determination is not suitable in related conditions."

CD009647,0,11219224,0,Syndromes of excess antidiuretic hormone release.,"Hyponatremia, particularly that due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), is common in patients seen in the critical care setting. Because of aging-associated changes in the hormonal and renal systems involved in regulation of water and sodium balance, older persons are at higher risk than the young. The high prevalence of disease states and drug use in the elderly can affect water and sodium conservation and further contribute to the risk of hyponatremia in this population. The approach to management is dependent both on the severity of hyponatremia-related symptoms and the rapidity with which hyponatremia has developed. Careful monitoring of serum sodium during treatment is essential to produce prompt resolution of symptoms while avoiding the development of central pontine myelinolysis. Several therapeutic modalities are available for the longterm management of chronic hyponatremia."
CD009647,0,8268648,0,The role of sequential ultrafiltration and varying dialysate sodium on vascular stability during hemodialysis.,"Hypotension is a very common problem during HD. We studied vascular stability during sequential UF with constant and variable dialysate Na. Ten chronic patients underwent HD using two protocols. Protocol A was sequential UF (50% weight loss in the first hour, 30% in the second, and 20% in the third hour) with a dialysate Na of 140 mEq/L. Protocol B was sequential UF as in protocol A with varying dialysate Na (150 mEq/L in the first hr, 142 in the second, and 137 in the third). BP and pulse were monitored every 30 min. Hct, BUN, creatinine, osmolality, and serum albumin were checked every hour. The plasma volume decreased by 5.3% in protocol A as compared with 1.2% in protocol B, as shown by the Hct values. The decrease in serum osmolality during the first and second hours was more marked in protocol A than in protocol B (p < 0.05), but post-dialysis values were similar. The clinical parameters (UF, BP, pulse rate) and serum Na showed no difference. The intradialytic mannitol infusion was 10 ml/HD and 0, whereas saline was 80 ml/HD and 10 for A and B, respectively. These data suggest: (1) Sequential UF with varying dialysate Na could benefit patients who are hemodynamically unstable. (2) The need for mannitol and saline may be more readily alleviated with protocol B than with protocol A. (3) The beneficial effect of varying dialysate Na with sequential UF may be due to improved plasma refilling and decreased early intradialytic osmolar changes."
CD009647,0,721950,0,"Interrelationships among thiazide diuretics and calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium balance in normal and hypertensive man.","The benzothiadiazide diuretics are known to cause magnesium and potassium wasting and retention of calcium and uric acid. The effect of magnesium replacement on diuretic-induced changes in sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium balance, weight, and blood pressure was studied in 12 normal subjects and 13 hypertensive patients to determine whether oral magnesium would reduce thiazide-induced kaliuresis. The groups differed in their response to diuresis in that the normotensive subjects did not show a fall in blood pressure (despite an equivalent weight loss), returned to a state of sodium balance earlier, and developed a greater net negative potassium balance over 12 days of diuretic therapy. Both groups displayed calcium and uric acid retention and magnesium wasting during diuretic therapy. The addition of oral magnesium replacement during diuretic therapy had no effect on any measured values beyond that seen in subjects who took diuretics without magnesium replacement. Thus, magnesium replacement did not reduce urinary potassium loss. However, urinary calcium losses increased when magnesium was given to subjects who were not receiving diuretics. The data provide the first report that small doses of oral magnesium enhance calcium excretion in hypertensive subjects."

Value of regulating the rate of ultrafiltration].,"Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH) requires constant supervision and frequent readjustment of the rate of infusion of the substitution fluid because of variable filtration rate. In order to lighten the management of patients treated with CAVH, an ultrafiltration-pump assisted CAVH was used in 16 patients with oliguric renal failure and cardiovascular instability treated in the intensive care unit. A plate hemofilter (Biospal) was used which is equipped with the high hydraulic permeability AN 69 S membrane. The driving pump was set in order to modulate the ultrafiltration rate from 400 to 1000 ml/h. Ultrafiltration-pump assisted CAVH was given for 8.1 +/- 5.3 days and the filtration volume was 16.3 +/- 3.1 l/day. The mean life span of the hemofilter was 36.4 +/- 27.3 hours. No adverse reaction toward the artificial membrane was detected. Adequate control of fluid balance and electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis were obtained allowing parenteral nutrition. However, in two instances additional hemodialysis was required to adequately control urea generation. Ultrafiltration-pump assisted CAVH proved to be a simple and effective method of fluid removal and urea subtraction by convective transport. Maintenance of stable fluid balance and parenteral nutrition without osmotic disequilibrium was allowed. The pump driven hemofiltration allows optimal use of the filter."

Coma associated with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria is multifactorial, but associated with histological evidence of parasitized erythrocyte sequestration and resultant microvascular congestion in cerebral vessels. To determine whether these changes cause breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and resultant perivascular or parenchymal cerebral oedema, histology, immunohistochemistry and image analysis were used to define the prevalence of histological patterns of oedema and the expression of specific molecular pathways involved in water balance in the brain in adults with fatal falciparum malaria."

Though urinary volume decreased significantly, its osmolality did not rise. According to the operational stress this type of operation can be divided into an: 1) intra-abdominal and a 2) perineal phase. In the secretory and concentrating capacity of the kidney, again two phases can be distinguished. Owing to the great operational stress patients with deficient renal function often develop renal failure. It is stressed that such patients close observation, careful hydration prior to operation and the administration of diuretics are of particular importance."

CD009647,0,10890028,0,Effect of oral eicosapentaenoic acid on weight loss in patients with pancreatic cancer.,"Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been shown to modulate aspects of the inflammatory response that may contribute to weight loss in cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability and effects of oral supplementation with high-purity EPA in weight-losing patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Twenty-six patients were entered into the study. EPA (95% pure) was administered as free acid starting at 1 g/day; the dose was increased to 6 g/day over four weeks, and then a maintenance dose of 6 g/day was administered. Patients were assessed before EPA and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks while receiving EPA, for weight, body composition, hematologic and clinical chemistry variables, acute-phase protein response, and performance status. Overall survival was noted. Supplementation was well tolerated, with only five patients experiencing side effects possibly attributable to the EPA. Before starting EPA, all patients had been losing weight at a median rate of 2 kg/mo. In general, after EPA supplementation, weight was stable. After four weeks of EPA supplementation, patients had a median weight gain of 0.5 kg (p = 0.0009 vs. rate of weight loss at baseline), and this stabilization of weight persisted over the 12-week study period. Total body water as a percentage of body weight remained stable, as did the proportion of patients with an acute-phase protein response, patients' nutritional intake, and performance status. Overall median survival from diagnosis in this study was 203 days. This study suggests that EPA is well tolerated, may stabilize weight in cachectic pancreatic cancer patients, and should be tested as an anticachectic agent in controlled trials."

CD009647,0,3306868,0,Diuretic therapy and exercise performance.,"Drugs that induce an increased urine flow are used both legitimately (treatment of hypertension and oedema) and otherwise (rapid weight loss) in sports and exercise. There are 5 major categories of diuretic drugs based on their mechanisms and loci of action. Common to all classes is hypohydration, which has been shown to have an array of adverse effects on performance, including impaired strength, power and endurance. Postural hypotension can be particularly troublesome in the elderly. Also common to all diuretics, except those interfering with the aldosterone mechanism in the distal nephron, is hypokalaemia. Severe symptomatic hypokalaemia (serum K+ concentration less than 3.0 mmol/L) is rare except in clinical situations in which additional hypokalaemic factors are present. Moderate levels of hypokalaemia (serum K+ concentration 3.0 to 3.5 mmol/L) can increase the risk of adverse reactions as has been shown in a variety of prospective clinical studies. Hypokalaemia has effects on cardiac rhythm, muscle function and integrity, local blood flow, carbohydrate metabolism, and the blood lipid profile. Performance studies generally show diminished exercise tolerance in direct proportion to the degree of hypohydration induced. This is not the case, however, in a clinical setting of compromised cardiopulmonary function, in which diuresis has direct and indirect inotropic effects which augment exercise tolerance and decrease symptoms. The ability of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, to induce a hyperventilatory response to the obligatory metabolic acidosis is taken advantage of in mountaineering to prevent or ameliorate the symptoms of acute mountain sickness, thereby improving exercise performance at high altitude. It is suggested that in clinical situations in which the use of a diuretic is considered appropriate, every effort be made to maintain or restore the serum concentration and the total body store of potassium to normal. To some degree this can be accomplished through diet, although potassium chloride supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics or diuretic combinations may be necessary."
CD009647,0,2524680,0,Comparative effects of haemodialysis and haemofiltration on plasma atrial natriuretic peptide.,"The effects of 4 h haemodialysis (15 patients) or 4 h haemofiltration (five patients) on plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were compared by means of a sensitive radioreceptor binding assay, and related to accompanying changes in body weight, blood pressure and plasma renin activity. Before dialysis, plasma ANP concentrations were considerably elevated: haemodialysis group 10-484 pmol/l (mean 156 pmol/l); haemofiltration group 72-320 pmol/l (mean 170 pmol/l). Although plasma concentrations of ANP fell markedly with treatment in both groups: post-haemodialysis 2-187 pmol/l (mean 67 pmol/l); post-haemofiltration 47-135 pmol/l (mean 79 pmol/l), after treatment it remained above the normal range in 14 of the 20 patients. Pretreatment plasma ANP was related to systolic blood pressure (r = 0.459; P less than 0.05) but bore no relationship to mean or diastolic blood pressure, or plasma renin activity. The fall in plasma ANP concentration during treatment correlated with the postural blood pressure drop after dialysis (r = 0.505; P less than 0.05), but was unrelated to changes in weight or plasma renin activity with haemodialysis or haemofiltration. Plasma ANP concentrations rose rapidly again in the 60 min after dialysis treatment, without change in body weight. These results show that high levels of biologically active ANP circulate in end-stage renal disease. The fact that these are not reduced to normal by haemodialysis or haemofiltration, despite restoration to normovolaemic or hypovolaemic state, suggests that the increased levels of ANP in end-stage renal failure are due to both hypervolaemia and other factors, which may include occult cardiac dysfunction and loss of renal clearance."

Oral anticoagulant therapy was discontinued before non cardiac operation while subcutaneous heparine therapy was initiated. There were no bleeding or thromboembolic complications during the perioperative period or later in the follow-up. In order to prevent bacterial endocarditis, prophylactic antibiotherapy was associated with careful surgical asepsis. No case of endocarditis was encountered during a mean follow-up of 22 months. Cardiac medications such as digitalis and beta adrenergic blockers were maintained as long as possible during the perioperative period while their dosage and clinical effects were closely monitored. No patient did present cardiac failure, significant arrhythmia or blood pressure impairment. No perioperative myocardial infarcts occurred in the group of coronary artery bypass graft patients. Those patients were managed in order to maintain their myocardial muscle work in optimal ranges thanks to selective premedication, brief interruption of beta adrenergic blockers, strict control of fluid balance and careful postoperative pain relief."

Neuromuscular disease.,"Multifrequency electrical impedance myography (MFEIM) in the 3-300 kHz range was applied to 68 subjects representing 19 different neuromuscular diseases, and the impedances analyzed using the 5-element circuit model. Depending on severity, the 'cellular' parameters r(2), r(3), 1/c(1) and 1/c(2) were found to be as much as 10- to 20-fold larger than for normal subjects (taking age and girth into account), but in almost every case the extracellular fluid parameter r(1) was at most only marginally affected. Strong correlations are found between r(2) and 1/c(1,) but in the case of ALS that breaks down when c(1) (representing the muscle fiber membrane capacitance) falls below half the normal value. Also, c(2) (tentatively associated with intracellular organelle membranes) was found to be the most sensitive to disease progress in ALS, about three times more so than the 50 kHz phase, already suggested for use in clinical drug testing. We conclude that following parameters obtained using the combined MFEIM/5-element circuit analysis scheme offer a reliable, non-invasive and objective way of characterizing muscle in neuromuscular disease or during clinical drug testing."
CD009647,0,16475460,0,A typology of oral hydration problems exhibited by frail nursing home residents.,"Dehydration remains a substantial problem for nursing home residents, often with poor health outcomes. The purpose of this investigation was to establish 6-month prevalence of dehydration events in nursing home residents and to describe common hydration problems of nursing home residents. In this prospective observational study, 35 nursing home residents were followed for 6 months to assess problems with hydration and to evaluate the presence of dehydration. Urine specific gravity and color, bioimpedance measurements, meal intake recordings, and chart abstraction were used to assess hydration status. Field notes and informal staff interviews were used to describe specific hydration problems and clinically relevant interventions. Dehydration events occurred in 31% (11 of 35) of residents during the 6-month period. A typology of hydration problems was developed from the field observations. The typology consists of four groups (i.e., Can Drink, Can't Drink, Won't Drink, End of Life) and six corresponding subgroups. Demographic and hydration characteristics of the subgroups were compared and contrasted. Comparisons revealed the Won't Drink group is most vulnerable to dehydration events because this group has the highest percentage of dehydration events (58%, 4 of 7), the highest average specific gravity, and the lowest consumption of fluids during meals. Nursing interventions for the subgroups are discussed. Targeting nursing interventions to the specific hydration problem exhibited is proposed."

CD009647,0,3337511,0,Renal salt wasting in patients treated with cisplatin.,"Although cisplatin nephrotoxicity is well documented, renal sodium wasting has rarely been reported. Seven of seventy patients treated with cisplatin over 18 months developed salt-wasting nephropathy and orthostatic hypotension. All patients presented 2 to 4 months after starting cisplatin with severe orthostatic hypotension (mean orthostatic change in blood pressure, -37 +/- 8 mm Hg) without preceding extrarenal volume loss or diuretic use. Urinary sodium concentration was 85 to 145 mmol/L, fractional excretion of sodium was 1.0% to 8.0%, and urinary osmolar concentration was 340 to 619 mmol/kg, while orthostatic hypotension was present. Six patients were hyponatremic (116 to 137 mmol/L). Serum creatinine and urea levels were elevated in five patients but fell after rehydration. Vasopressin averaged 5.4 pg/mL (2.1 to 12.7 pg/mL) (n = 5) and was suppressed with hydration (mean, 2.5 pg/mL, 1.5 to 4.3 pg/mL). Plasma renin activity was undetectable in two patients and low in three patients, and aldosterone was low in six patients despite clinical volume depletion. Cisplatin may produce renal salt wasting causing symptomatic orthostatic hypotension and hyponatremia associated with abnormalities of the renin-aldosterone system."

Twenty-eight patients with Sheehan's syndrome, diagnosed and followed at our University Endocrinology Clinic in the last 20 years were reported in the study. Medical history, physical examination, routine laboratory examinations, pituitary hormone analysis, CT and/or MRI scan of the sella of the patients were reviewed. All patients had a history of massive hemorrhage at delivery and physical signs of Sheehan's syndrome. Twenty-six of them lacked postpartum milk production, followed by failure of resumption of menses. There were 9 subjects with disturbances in consciousness associated with hyponatremia on admittance. All 28 patients had secondary hypothyroidism, adrenal cortex failure, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and growth hormone deficiency. Diabetes insipidus has not been found in any patient. Empty sellae were revealed in 8 patients by CT and/or MRI scan. Sheehan's syndrome is still encountered in clinical practice occasionally. If not diagnosed early, it could cause increased morbidity and mortality. The most important clues for diagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome are lack of lactation and failure of menstrual resumption after a delivery complicated with severe hemorrhage."
CD009647,0,10586551,0,[Measurements of extracellular water volume by bioelectrical impedance analysis during perioperative period of esophageal resection].,"Segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was conducted in five patients who underwent esophageal resections. Resistance values fitted at zero frequency (R0) in each body segment (arm, trunk and leg) were determined before the induction of anesthesia, at the end of surgery and on the second or third postoperative day. Extracellular water volume (ECW) in each body segment was estimated using the equation derived from the cell suspension theory. ECW in whole body was obtained from the sum of each body segment. R0 in trunk and leg significantly decreased at the end of surgery compared to the values before the induction of anesthesia (P < 0.05). The change ratio of R0 in trunk before the induction of anesthesia was significantly lower at the end of surgery than that in arm (P < 0.05), resulting from the most striking fluid accumulation in the trunk. Postoperatively, R0 in all body segments, however, appeared to decrease similarly compared to the values before the induction of anesthesia, suggesting the redistribution phenomena of extracellular water among body segments. The correlation (r = 0.90, P < 0.001) and good agreement [bias = 0.01 (L)] between net fluid balances and estimates of ECW changes in whole body suggest that BIA allows close monitoring of tissue hydration during perioperative period by providing estimates of ECW in body segments."
CD009647,0,2522688,0,Atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations in hypoxic secondary pulmonary hypertension: relation to haemodynamic and blood gas variables and response to supplemental oxygen.,"Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations, measured in samples drawn from the pulmonary artery, were raised in nine of 17 patients with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension but normal right atrial pressures at rest. No relationship was seen between atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations and mean pulmonary artery or right atrial pressure, or calculated pulmonary or systemic vascular resistance. Patients with the most severe hypoxaemia tended to have higher plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations; three patients with no past history of oedema had concentrations more than twice the upper limit of normal. Treatment with supplementary oxygen for 30 minutes reduced pulmonary vascular resistance in all patients but had no significant effect on plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration. These findings suggest that atrial natriuretic peptide may be a factor in the control of sodium and water balance in hypoxic cor pulmonale, where the determinants of individual susceptibility to peripheral oedema are not well understood."

CD009647,0,21229778,0,[Desmopressin for nocturia in the old: an inappropriate treatment due to the high risk of side-effects?].,"Desmopressin, a synthetic analog of the antidiuretic hormone, is used in the treatment of enuresis nocturna in children and increasingly also in adults. Nocturia in the elderly causes sleeping disorders and is associated with a higher risk of falling and increased mortality. Desmopressin leads to a significant decrement of nocturia and consequently, a better sleep quality and is for this reason increasingly prescribed in the old. Desmopressin causes borderline hyponatremia (130-135 mmol/l) in 15% and severe hyponatremia in 5% of all adult users. Factors that predispose to hyponatremia are a higher dose, age > 65 years, a low-normal serum sodium, a high 24-hour urine volume and co-medication (thiazide diuretics, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors, chlorpromazine, carbamazipine, loperamide, Non-Steroidal-Anti-Inflammatory-Drugs). Hyponatremia is associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and can cause somnolence, loss of consciousness and death. We present two cases where initiation of desmopressin led to hyponatremia, requiring hospitalization. In view of the high risk of desmopressin-associated hyponatremia in the older population, alternative treatment strategies for nocturia must be considered first. If desmopressin is prescribed, strict follow-up of serum sodium levels is necessary."

CD009647,0,23483469,0,[Orthostatic hypotension in the elderly].,"Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg, or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within three minutes of standing. It results from an inadequate response to postural changes in blood pressure. Common symptoms include dizziness, light-headedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, nausea, palpitations, sweating, head and neck ache, slow cognitive performance and transient loss of conscientiousness. OH is a common problem among elderly patients and its aetiology is diverse, including autonomic nervous system dysfunction, cardiac problems, medication side effects, ageing changes or transitory deregulation of blood volume. The instrumental diagnosis can be easily accomplished by the tilt-table test, with continuous monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac parameters. It is a non-invasive technique and needs minimal collaboration from the patient. In our experience, when reviewing 327 patients, aged over 40 years and examined because of clinical suspicion of OH, the prevalence thereof was 51% whereas if focused in subjects older than 70, OH was proven in 90% of the cases. The older the patients, the more frequently they presented general deterioration, neurological or cardiac problems as well as pharmacological side effects. Ruling out neurological or cardiac malfunction can drastically improve the prognosis with possible reversibility of symptoms. Some nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches to improve management of OH and life quality are described for guidance."

CD009647,0,9128878,0,Dehydration in the elderly: strategies for prevention and management.,"Dehydration is the most common fluid and electrolyte disturbance among the elderly population today. It is defined as a state of diminished total body water content and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Such health outcomes highlight the urgent need for effective screening and prevention in the primary care arena. Myriad predisposing factors make the elderly more vulnerable to dehydration. On physical examination, many of the classic signs of dehydration may be present among normally hydrated older populations, highlighting the need for an age-appropriate assessment. In this regard, health care practitioners with a working knowledge of pertinent underlying pathophysiology and relevant predisposing factors will more readily identify high-risk clients and implement successful preventative strategies. Prompt intervention can dramatically affect health care outcomes among high-risk populations and go a long way in providing high-quality, cost-effective health care."
CD009647,0,8967479,0,Glucose tolerance and insulin action in healthy centenarians.,"Advancing age has been found to be associated with a decline in insulin action. Nevertheless, no study has been conducted in healthy centenarians. Our study investigates glucose tolerance and insulin action in centenarians. Fifty-two subjects were enrolled. The subjects were divided in three groups as follows: 1) adults (< 50 yr; n = 20);2) aged subjects (> 75 yr; n = 22); and 3) centenarians (> 100 yr; n = 14). Body composition was studied by bioimpedance analysis. In all subjects, an oral glucose tolerance test and euglycemic glucose clamp were performed. Centenarians have a lower fat-free mass (FFM) than aged subjects and adults, whereas fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, free fatty acids, urea, and creatinine were not different in the groups studies. Centenarians had a 2-h plasma glucose concentration (6.0 +/- 0.2 mmol/l) that was lower than that in aged subjects (6.6 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, P < 0.05) but not different from adults [6.4 +/- 0.4 mmol/l, P = not significant (NS)]. During the clamp, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were similar in the three groups. In these conditions, centenarians had a whole body glucose disposal (34.1 +/- 0.6 mumol.kg FFM-1.min 1) that was greater than that in aged subjects (23.3 +/- 0.5 mumol.kg FFM-1.min-1 P < 0.01) but not different from adults (34.6 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg x min, P = NS). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that centenarians compared with aged subjects had a preserved glucose tolerance and insulin action."

CD009647,0,7309224,0,[The effect of preoperative food and fluid restrictions on various metabolic parameters in geriatric patients].,"This clinical investigation was carried out in order to determine whether the 10-12 hr food and fluid restrictions imposed before elective operations have detrimental effects on older patients according to various metabolic parameters. Thirty male urological patients aged between 60 and 90 years were chosen for study (group I 60-70 years, group II 70-80 years, group III 89-90 years). The following parameters were measured at 7 p.m. the evening before the operation, and at 7. a.m. on the morning of operation: body weight, hematocrit, blood-gas analysis, electrolytes, serum osmolality, urea, creatinine, total protein with electrophoresis and blood glucose. Urine was collected during the period of abstinence and osmolality, electrolytes, total nitrogen, creatinine and urea were estimated. All patients showed a reduced creatinine clearance to a degree that was expected for their age. In all three groups a significant weight reduction (p less than 0,001) occurred during the time of observation. The 12 hr urine volume increased from one age group to the next whereas perspiration decreased, indicating deficient thermal regulations in older patients. The hypohydration on the morning of operation, especially in group II and III, marked a relatively lower hematocrit and hypoproteinemia. In all three groups the urea and creatinine values were slightly lower in the morning than in the evening before, indicating the occurrence of further hypohydration due to fasting. The low elimination of total nitrogen, urea, and creatinine in the urine could be an indication that the 12 hr food and fluid restriction caused no marked catabolism. Our study shows that geriatric patients are indeed able to compensate for a 12 hr-period of abstinence. When however, these patients also have to undergo an operation, possibly associated with a considerable loss of body fluids or when restriction of oral intake extends to 16-20 hrs, decompensation may rapidly occur leading to deleterious consequences."

How to detect them?].,"We report about 5 iliac anastomotic false aneurysms that occurred in 4 patients 8 to 21 years (average 15.5 years) after aortoiliac prosthetic reconstruction. The diagnosis was not established at once because of atypical clinical signs, in spite of the constant presence of an abdominal pulsating mass. All patients were operated by portal excision and graft replacement. One patient, who had presented with a hypovolemic collapse due to an acute rupture, died. The incidence of iliac false aneurysms after aortoiliac reconstructions is underestimated because the clinical surveillance is not reliable. The analysis of the explorations that were proposed led to prefer computed tomography to ultrasonography and angiography. The period of occurrence of iliac false aneurysms ranges between 6 to 10 years in average after the first operation. We therefore propose to perform a systematic follow-up CT examination on the 5th postoperative year, then every 5 years, and to operate the iliac false aneurysms as soon as their diagnosis is made."

To evaluate the efficacy of a moisturizer (Locobase), we studied 111 cleaners and kitchen workers during everyday exposure to water and detergents. All took part in a standardized interview. After randomization, 1/2 the workers (n = 56) used Locobase during a period of 2 weeks (period L), followed by a period without any emollient (period C), or vice versa (n = 55). Clinical assessment and measurements of the skin surface temperature, electrical capacitance and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were performed on the fingers, hands and arms on entry to the study, after 2 weeks and 4 weeks, or at drop out. The final evaluation showed that 70 (63%) were able to complete the study; 23 (21%) completed period L, but withdrew from period C after a mean of 6 days because of progressive dryness of the skin and eczema; and 12 (11%) were excluded because they used topical corticosteroids or emollients. The remaining 6 (5%) participants were lost to follow-up. Clinically, we observed a significant increase in dryness (p < 0.001) during periods of no treatment (period C), and normalization of the skin texture during use of Locobase. Clinical observations were confirmed by statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) in the electrical capacitance (epidermal hydration), which decreased during period C and increased to pre-study values during period L. No significant differences were found in skin temperatures and TEWL rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Evidence supports a relationship between increased dietary calcium intake and lower body weight. This study was conducted to investigate the association between dietary calcium intake, BMI, and percentage of body fat (PBF) in American Indians (ages 47-79 y) in the Strong Heart Study (SHS) (2nd exam, 1992-1995). SHS data were compared with data for the general U.S. adult population from the NHANES III (1988-1994). BMI was calculated as kg/m(2). PBF was estimated by bioelectrical impedance using an equation based on total body water. The clinical examination included measures of blood chemistry. Dietary data were collected using a 24-h dietary recall. Calcium intake was significantly lower in SHS participants than in age-matched NHANES III participants. Mean calcium intake in the SHS was 680 mg/d (range: 103-4574 mg/d) for men and 610 mg/d (range: 71-4093 mg/d) for women (P < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, BMI and PBF were lower by 0.80 kg/m(2) (95% CI: -1.53 to -0.08, P = 0.046) and 1.28% (95% CI: -2.10 to -0.47, P = 0.011) in SHS participants with higher (> or = 873 mg/d in the 5th quintile) vs. lower calcium intake (<313 mg/d in the 1st quintile).

CD009647,0,14614757,0,"Reliability and variability of bioimpedance measures in normal adults: effects of age, gender, and body mass.","This study aimed to analyze the reliability and evaluate the causes of variability of bioimpedance parameters. Direct measures were analyzed because they are not affected by inappropriate prediction models. Resistance (R), reactance (Xc), and phase angle (PA) were determined at three fixed frequencies (5, 50, and 100 kHz) in 653 normal Germans (244 males and 409 females), aged 20-90 years, using a phase-sensitive whole-body tetrapolar bioimpedance analyzer (BIA 2000-M, Data Input, Germany). From these values, six bioimpedance ratios were calculated (R(5)/R(50), R(5)/R(100), Xc(5)/Xc(50), Xc(5)/Xc(100), PA(5)/PA(50), and PA(5)/PA(100)). Reliability of duplicate measurements, as determined by technical error, is high. ANOVA for repeated measurements yields a significant frequency main effect (within-subjects factor) and significant effects of age and gender (between-subject factors) on variation of resistance, reactance, and phase angle. Multiple regression analyses indicate independent effects of age, gender, and body mass index on variability of resistance, reactance, and phase angle at the three frequencies. Gender primarily influences variation in resistance (smaller values in males), whereas age mainly affects variations in reactance and phase angle (smaller values in older adults). Obesity is associated with smaller resistance (at all frequencies) and smaller reactance (high frequencies), but larger phase-angle values (low frequency). The study shows that variability of direct bioimpedance measures depends on age, gender, and body mass characteristics of the study population. The potential benefit for using both low and high frequencies in R measures is to differentiate between extra- and intracellular fluid spaces, which may be altered during human growth and aging."

One hundred patients with normal serum creatinine levels were randomly assigned to receive intravenous urography with either an ionic high-osmolar or a nonionic low-osmolar contrast medium. Patient hydration was evaluated by measuring urine osmolality in a sample voided just before the examination. The plasma concentration of iodine was determined in a single blood sample drawn approximately 3 hours later. From these determinations the plasma clearance of contrast medium was calculated. The urograms were assessed blindly with regard to nephrographic and pyelographic opacification, as well as overall diagnostic quality. The clearance varied between 42 and 115 mL x minutes-1 x 1.73 m-2. No systematic correlation of practical significance was found between the clearances and the urogram quality. A high urinary osmolality before the examination tended to improve quality with both media. It is not possible to assess glomerular filtration rate from nephrographic and pyelographic opacification, or from overall quality of routine urograms in patients with normal serum creatinine levels."

Contrast enhancement (CE) of the pancreas was measured by dynamic CT during the first 24 hours after admission to the hospital. A control study was performed in 48 hours, if the finding on the primary CT was not definite or there was a discrepancy between CT and the clinical finding. Patients with HP showed significantly lower CE during the first minute after bolus injection of contrast material than patients with either normal pancreas or those who had OP. Only 4 out of 65 patients with HP showed normal (over 40 HU) and 8 out of 103 patients with OP showed low (less than 30 HU) CE. The method seems to be the most reliable method available to differentiate HP from OP.

Although bioimpedance has been introduced as an accurate method for assessing hydration status, the instrument is not available in general hemodialysis (HEMO) centers. This study was conducted to explore the correlation between hydration status measured by bioimpedance and blood pressure parameters in chronic HEMO patients. Multifrequency bioimpedance analysis was used to determine pre- and post-dialysis hydration status in 32 stable HEMO patients. Extracellular water/total body water (ECW/TBW) determined by sum of segments from bioimpedance analysis was used as an index of hydration status. The mean age was 57.9 ± 16.4 years. The mean dry weight and body mass index were 57.7 ± 14.5 kg and 22.3 ± 4.7 kg/m(2), respectively. Pre-dialysis ECW/TBW was significantly correlated with only pulse pressure (r = 0.5, P = 0.003) whereas post-dialysis ECW/TBW had significant correlations with pulse pressure, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.6, P = 0.001, r = 0.4, P = 0.04, r = -0.4, and P = 0.02, respectively). After dialysis, the mean values of ECW/TBW, systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure were significantly decreased. ECW/TBW was used to classify the patients into normohydration (≤ 0.4) and overhydration (>0.4) groups. Systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure significantly reduced after dialysis in the normohydration group but did not significantly change in the overhydration group. Pre-dialysis pulse pressure, post-dialysis pulse pressure, and post-dialysis systolic blood pressure in the overhydration group were significantly higher than normohydration group. Due to the simplicity and cost, blood pressure parameters, especially pulse pressure, might be a simple reference for clinicians to determine hydration status in HEMO patients."
CD009647,0,7969774,0,Suppression of gonadotropin secretion in the hospitalized postmenopausal female as an effect of acute critical illness.,"Plasma gonadotropins were measured in 126 postmenopausal women (age range 69-90 years) admitted to a geriatric ward. After clinical examination, patients were classified as 'acutely or severely ill' or as 'not ill'. Plasma gonadotropins were compared between both groups. Logistic regression was used to select clinical and/or biochemical parameters which differentiated patients with abnormal, low gonadotropins from patients with high gonadotropin concentrations. Plasma gonadotropins were significantly lower in the 'acutely or severely ill' than in the 'healthy' patient group. By logistic regression, blood sedimentation rate, total protein concentration, and serum thyrotropin concentration were significantly correlated with low gonadotropins. Linear regression analysis showed a significant linear relationship between plasma gonadotropins and age (at least for ages over 80 years), blood sedimentation rate (at values more than 65 mm) and total protein concentration. Marked suppression of plasma gonadotropins was frequently found to occur in acutely ill postmenopausal women, in relation to biochemical parameters of acute illness such as blood sedimentation rate, total protein concentration, and serum thyrotropin. In addition, ageing per se seems characterized by a progressive attenuation of the high postmenopausal gonadotropin levels."

CD009647,0,9521635,0,Supplementation with isoflavonoid phytoestrogens does not alter serum lipid concentrations: a randomized controlled trial in humans.,"Isoflavonoids are a class of flavonoids that are derived in the human diet mainly from soybean-based foods. The major dietary isoflavonoids, genistein and daidzein, have estrogen-like activity and are classed as phytoestrogens. Because estrogens can lower serum LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol, the objective of this study was to determine if isoflavonoids could improve serum lipids in healthy subjects. Forty-six men and 13 postmenopausal women not receiving hormone replacement therapy completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of two-way parallel design and 8 wk duration. One tablet containing 55 mg of isoflavonoids (predominantly in the form of genistein) or one placebo tablet was taken daily with the evening meal. Subjects maintained their usual diet and physical activity, which were unchanged throughout the intervention. Measurement of isoflavonoids and their metabolites in 24-h urine samples provided an assessment of compliance and of isoflavonoid metabolism. Serum total, LDL, HDL and HDL subclass cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein (a) were assessed at baseline and during the last week of intervention. After adjustment for baseline values, no significant differences in postintervention serum lipid and lipoprotein (a) concentrations between groups were identified. Further adjustment for age, gender and weight change did not alter the results. In addition, changes in urinary isoflavonoids were not significantly correlated with changes in serum lipids and lipoprotein (a). Therefore, this study does not support the hypothesis that isoflavonoid phytoestrogens can improve the serum lipids, at least in subjects with average serum cholesterol concentrations."
CD009647,0,11195844,0,[Malnutrition in the elderly. Clinical consequences].,"A COMMON PROBLEM: Undernutrition occurs when nutrient intake does not meet nutritional needs. Selective food intake induced micronutrient deficits (moderate undernutrition) and can later lead to protein calorie malnutrition (PCM). PCM is often discovered during acute illness (increased nutritional needs). PCM is observed in 30 to 50% of the institutionalized population and in 2-4% of the elderly living at home. Micronutrient deficits are far more frequent and concern 4 million elderly persons in France. AGE-RELATED CHANGES: Decreased smell and taste capacities and the inability to modify eating habits in stress conditions are mainly responsible for low food intake. Low intake leads to immunodeficiency, and subsequent frailty. Any intercurrent illness aggravates both undernutrition and immunodeficiency, creating a disease-to-disease spiral (undernutrition-immunodeficiency) that is difficult to inverse. SIGNS OF PCM: Early signs of protein-calorie malnutrition are nonspecific: fatigue, apathy, decline in muscle strength. It is important to diagnose undernutrition at this stage before more specific symptoms develop: anorexia, weight loss, infection. Metabolic disorders occur at a later stage, generally during an acute illness, leading to overt PCM with perturbed glucose metabolism, recurrent infection, dehydration, impaired wound healing and calcium bone loss. The length of refeeding therapy depends on the intensity of the clinical signs, weight loss, dehydration, glucose metabolism disorder and/or on the severity of clinical complications such as infection or bone fractures."
CD009647,0,8553593,0,[Determination of dry weight of hemodialyzed patients on the basis of the ratio of extracellular fluid volume to total body fluid volume as measured by multifrequency impedance].,"Whole body impedometry is relatively new non-invasive method to measure the distribution of total body water (TBW) between extra- and intracellular compartment (VEC, VIC). Having applied linear regression analysis onto the relation of the ratio of the extracellular volume to the volume of total body water (VEC/TBW) and the age in a group of healthy individuals very narrow scatter from the regression line was found. This line can thus be used as an indicator of normohydration status with respect to age. Assuming that the relation of VEC/TBW vs. age is the same in dialysed patients and that the state of normohydration corresponds to the so called dry weight, the VEC/TBW value can be used as a novel indicator of dry weight. Any deviation of the pre-dialysis VEC/TBW value from normal could easily be used to establish the desired ultrafiltration and dry weight. With regard to the known inaccuracy with which the dry weight is determined from purely clinical assessment this approach may lead to substantial objectivisation in determination of this principal parameter. It may be especially helpful in case of newly admitted patients. The suggested new approach to dry weight determination is supported by the finding of statistically significant relation between post-dialysis deviation of the VEC/TBW ratio from the normal value vs. blood volume reduction at the end of the dialysis session. Patients classified at the end of a dialysis session as still overhydrated by their VEC/TBW deviation from normal showed little or no reduction in their blood volume. An investigation of the Vena Cava Inferior diameter in a subgroup of these patients confirmed this finding showing no decrease at the end of dialysis. On the contrary, the patients whose post-dialysis VEC/TBW value was normal or below normal showed both significant reduction in their blood volume as well as decrease in the Vena Cava Inferior diameter."

CD009647,0,12846628,0,A pilot study of the effect of the Queen's Square external bladder stimulator on urinary retention after knee replacement surgery.,"Postoperative urinary retention remains an important problem after major orthopaedic surgery and can increase morbidity. External vibration applied to the suprapubic region has improved bladder emptying and urinary symptoms in patients with neurogenic bladders. Forty-three patients undergoing elective major knee surgery were randomly assigned to receive either a Queen's Square bladder stimulator or placebo device for 24 h postoperatively. No statistically significant differences in rates of urinary retention could be demonstrated in the bladder stimulator group compared to the placebo group (41% and 33%, respectively). There were no differences between the two groups when analysed for prostatic symptoms, type and effectiveness of analgesia and fluid balance. We conclude that, while the Queen's Square external bladder stimulator may be effective in treating chronic urinary retention associated with a neurogenic bladder, it does not appear to be effective in preventing postoperative urinary retention."
CD009647,0,21449992,0,Intrathoracic impedance vs daily weight monitoring for predicting worsening heart failure events: results of the Fluid Accumulation Status Trial (FAST).,"The relative sensitivity and unexplained detection rate of changes in intrathoracic impedance has not been compared with standard heart failure (HF) monitoring using daily weight changes. The Fluid Accumulation Status Trial (FAST) prospectively followed 156 HF patients with implanted cardioverter-defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices modified to record daily changes in intrathoracic impedance in a blinded fashion for 537±312 days. Daily impedance changes were used to calculate a fluid index that could be compared with a prespecified threshold. True positives were defined as adjudicated episodes of worsening HF occurring within 30 days of a fluid index above threshold or an acute weight gain. Unexplained detections were defined as threshold crossings or acute weight gains not associated with worsening HF. Impedance measurements were performed on >99% of follow-up days, compared with only 76% of days for weight measurements. Sixty-five HF events occurred during follow-up (0.32/patient-year). Forty HF events were detected by impedance but not weight, whereas 5 were detected by weight but not impedance. Sensitivity was greater (76% vs 23%; P<.0001) and unexplained detection rate was lower (1.9 vs 4.3/patient-year; P<.0001) for intrathoracic impedance monitoring at the threshold of 60Ω days compared with acute weight increases of 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 lbs in 3 days and also over a wide range of fluid index and weight thresholds. The sensitivity and unexplained detection rate of intrathoracic impedance monitoring was superior to that seen for acute weight changes. Intrathoracic impedance monitoring represents a useful adjunctive clinical tool for managing HF in patients with implanted devices."
CD009647,0,9143575,0,"Changes in body composition after gastrectomy: results of a controlled, prospective clinical trial.","To elucidate mechanisms involved in weight development after gastrectomy we have prospectively determined changes in body composition during the first year after similar operations. A total of 75 patients were enrolled who had a ""curative operation"" for gastric carcinoma; 42 were randomized to have a total gastrectomy, 23 total gastrectomy with a gastric substitute, and 10 subtotal gastrectomy. All reconstructions were done with a Roux-en-Y loop of the jejunum. Body composition was assessed preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months after gastrectomy by determining total body potassium and total body water. From these estimates, body cell mass, extracellular water, fat-free extracellular solids, and body fat were calculated with knowledge of the actual body weight and length. Triceps skinfold, arm muscle circumference, and grip strength were also measured. Weight loss (10% of preoperative weight) occurred early after the operations, after which body weight stabilized. Body cell mass remained essentially unchanged over the entire study period in contrast to body fat, which decreased by 40% during the first 6 months after gastrectomy. In accordance with the selective loss of body fat, we recorded a significant decrease in triceps skinfold figures and only a minor decrease of arm muscle circumference without obvious deterioration in hand grip strength. Weight loss after gastrectomy seems to be characterized by selective loss of body fat in contrast to other known clinical situations associated with impaired nutritional intake. Our observations form a basis for future clinical research aimed at preventing weight loss after these operations."

CD009647,0,8780360,0,Why bioelectrical impedance analysis should be used for estimating adiposity.,"The whole-body bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) approach for estimating adiposity and body fat is based on empirical relations established by many investigators. Properly used, this noninvasive body-composition assessment approach can quickly, easily, and relatively inexpensively provide accurate and reliable estimates of fat-free mass (FFM) and total body water (TBW) in healthy populations. The estimated FFM or TBW values are used to calculate absolute and relative body fat amounts. When different investigators follow the same standard BIA procedures and use the same population and criterion method, similar prediction equations and relatively small prediction errors have been reported for measurement of FFM and TBW (SEE: 1.7-3.0 for FFM and 0.23-1.5 kg for TBW). The BIA approach is most appropriate for estimating adiposity of groups in epidemiologic and field studies but has limited accuracy for estimating body composition in individuals. When used as a simple index (stature2/ resistance), BIA is more sensitive and specific for grading average adiposity in groups than some other anthropometric indexes such as the body mass index. Prediction equations based on BIA have been validated and cross-validated in children, youths, adults, and the elderly, in primarily white populations and, to a limited extent, in Asian, black, and Native American populations."

CD009647,0,20187484,0,The impact of fluid restriction policy in reducing the use of red blood cells in cardiac surgery.,"Hemodilution contributes significantly to transfusion requirements in patients undergoing CABG under CPB. We hypothesised that restriction of parenteral fluids in comparison to a liberal fluid administration policy leads to less use of packed red cells in CABG operations supported by cell salvage. After consent and approval, 130 patients operated under equal conditions were assigned prospectively and randomly either for a restrictive protocol for intravenous fluid administration (group A, 65 pts) or not (group B, 65 pts). Transfusion guidelines were common for the two groups. The volumes of intravenous fluids, priming, ""extra"" volume on pump and cardioplegic solution and the volume of urine were recorded. Net erythrocyte volume loss was calculated. The number of the transfused PRC was analyzed as a continuous variable. ""Transfusion"" was analyzed as a categorical characteristic. Significant difference existed between groups for the fluids administered intravenously until the initiation of CPB and for fluid balance after CPB. Intraoperatively transfused units were significantly lower in A (0.32 +/- 0.77 vs 1.26 +/- 1.05 u/per pt; p<0.0001). Transfused patients were also significantly lower in A (11/65 vs 44/65; p<0.0001). In both groups, the values of hematocrit were statistically decreased. The greatest difference compared to the preoperative values was observed after CPB (from 40.8 +/- 4.2 to 21.9 +/- 3.6 for A, and from 40.2 +/- 3.7 to 19.7 +/- 3.3 for B ; p<0.0001 for both). For these lowest values, significant difference existed between groups (p<0,001) while the difference in the hematocrit values to the end of operation was insignificant. Transfusion in ICU showed no significant difference among groups. Hours of mechanical ventilation in ICU were ranging from 5 to 29 (mean = 10.0, median = 9) for A and from 5 to 42 (mean = 14.8, median = 10) for B. Length of stay in ICU in nights for group A was ranging from 1 to 10 (mean = 2.7, median = 2) and for group B was ranging from 1 to 6 (mean = 3.5, median = 2). In conclusion, reduction of transfusions in CABG operations is feasible when a restrictive protocol for intravenous fluids is applied."

Seven patients attained a diastolic BP less than or equal to Hg. A significant postural fall in systolic BP was recorded, but no symptomatic orthostatic hypotension occurred. 3 In twelve patients measurements of plasma volume (125I-albumin), extracellular volume (82Br-space) and glomerular filtration rate (51Cr-EDTA clearance) on placebo and subsequently labetalol showed no systemic changes. 4 Side effects were few causing two withdrawals because of impotence and arthralgia. 5 It is concluded that monotherapy with labetalol results in clinically relevant, persistent and dose dependent reduction in BP in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, apparently without concomitant expansion of body fluid volumes or influence on glomerular filtration rate."
CD009647,0,12801253,0,Maintaining oral hydration in older adults: a systematic review.,"Dehydration is the most common fluid and electrolyte imbalance in older adults. The objectives were to identify the factors that increase the risk of dehydration in older adults, how best to assess the risk and manage oral fluid intake. Data sources included Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase and Current Contents, which were searched until February 2002. Randomized controlled trials for management of adequate fluid intake were undertaken. Cohort and case control studies were used for the identification of risk factors for dehydration. Studies of assessment tools for the identification of dehydration were also considered. Results show that there is no clear determination of the risk factors for dehydration and decreased fluid intake. The recommended daily intake of fluids should be not less than 1600 mL/24 h in order to ensure adequate hydration. A fluid intake sheet and urine specific gravity might be the best methods of monitoring daily fluid intake. Regular presentation of fluids to bedridden older adults can maintain adequate hydration status. In conclusion, more research is required to determine the optimum method of maintaining adequate oral hydration in older adults."

CD009647,0,1480755,0,Neurologic manifestations of hypothalamic disease.,"The hypothalamus, in addition to regulating the anterior and posterior pituitary, controls water balance through thirst, regulates food ingestion and body temperature, influences consciousness, sleep, emotion and other behaviors. Much has been learned of these effects in human disease through the clinical manifestations that occur with hypothalamic lesions. This study reviews the clinical pathologic correlations that have been made in recent years showing that regions of the hypothalamus exert functions in humans that are similar to those identified in experimental animals. Clinical pathologic correlations have not always provided precise analysis of hypothalamic function. The hypothalamus is small and often lesions that come to clinical attention achieve considerable size before their recognition, making local anatomic dissections of the effects of the lesions difficult. Nevertheless, the use of modern non-invasive techniques including CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have provided new information not previously available. This paper reviews several cases of hypothalamic disorder recognized recently. (1) A 33-year-old black man with hypothalamic sarcoidosis. Manifestations of hypothalamic dysfunction included panhypopituitarism, aggressive hyperphagia, polydipsia (partially due to hyperglycemia secondary to diabetes mellitus), drowsiness, depression, and irritability. (2) A 37-year-old woman with a large intrahypothalamic tumor (biopsy showed pituitary adenoma), with drowsiness, poikilothermia, lack of satiety, confusion, and memory loss. She becomes depressed when she is transiently more alert (as after hypertonic contrast-dye infusion). (3) A 60-year-old man with hypothalamic compression by a pituitary tumor, associated with syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH), severe anorexia, memory loss, but preserved thirst. After surgical decompression of the tumor his appetite acutely recovered, but he developed severe hypo(poikilo)thermia. (4) A 45-year-old woman with a suprasellar craniopharyngioma presented with severe drowsiness, hyperphagia, depression, and memory loss post-operatively, which responded to antidepressants (except for the memory loss). She had extremely labile blood pressures and serum Na for about 1 week post-operatively."
CD009647,0,17198093,0,Effect of head position on postoperative chemosis after prone spinal surgery.,"Conjunctival swelling is a common finding in patients positioned prone. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of head position on postoperative chemosis after prone spinal surgery. On the basis of the head position, 108 patients scheduled for prone lumbar surgery were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups: head neutral group (n=54) versus head down (HD) group (n=54). Head position was defined as neutral when the imaginary line from the occipital protuberance to the top of C7 spine process is parallel to the operating table. HD position was maintained by adjusting the height of the prone headrest 5 cm lower than neutral position. Chemosis was evaluated after surgery. The severity of chemosis, which was graded as none, mild, moderate, and severe, showed statistically significant difference between the head neutral group [24 (44%), 25 (46%), 3 (6%), 2 (4%), respectively] and HD group [10 (19%), 23 (43%), 17 (31%), 4 (7%), respectively, P<0.01]. Positive fluid balance and duration of surgery were risk factors for the development of postoperative chemosis. This result suggested that neutral head position, smaller fluid administration, and shorter duration of surgery were useful in decreasing the development of postoperative chemosis after prone spinal surgery."

Abnormal U waves have also been linked to certain cardiac medications, predominantly antiarrhythmics. However, mechanisms of U-wave-abnormality remains debated and perhaps elusive with the true U-wave relationship to T waves still being investigated. While there have indeed been reports of bifid (""notched"") T waves, such comparably described U waves have escaped us thus far.

CD009647,0,8672354,0,Cardiopulmonary bypass with modified fluid gelatin and heparin-coated circuits.,"We have assessed the efficacy of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) using normal colloid oncotic pressure (COP) in a randomized, controlled study of 20 patients undergoing elective coronary artery surgery using heparin-coated circuits. For CPB, we used either crystalloid priming 1650 ml (n = 10) or colloid priming 1650 ml (2.4% modified fluid gelatin, n = 10). While COP did not change during bypass in the colloid group, a decline was observed in the crystalloid group (P = 0.005). By the end of bypass, the decrease in COP compared with baseline (delta COP) was 8.5 (S.D. 1.1) mm Hg in the crystalloid group compared with 1.5 (2.1) mm Hg in the colloid group (P = 0.0001). delta COP correlated positively with fluid balance during bypass (r2 = 0.41, P = 0.002). Similar increments in complement factors C3b/c and C4b/c, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and neutrophil elastase, but not endotoxins, were found in both groups as indicators of a systemic inflammatory response. A clinical performance score composed of fluid balance, postoperative duration of intubation and the difference between rectal temperature and skin temperature was more favourable in patients treated with colloid priming (P = 0.03). Median postoperative hospital stay was 7 (range 5-16) days in the crystalloid group compared with 5 (4-8) days in the colloid group (P = 0.016). Regression analysis indicated that CPB time, fluid balance during operation and postoperative PO2/FlO2 ratio were independent factors that predicted postoperative hospital stay. From these preliminary results we conclude that in the absence of endotoxaemia, use of a normal COP during CPB with modified fluid gelatin in heparin-coated circuits resulted in an improved postoperative course an a reduction in hospital stay."

We have experienced 13 cases of coronary artery bypass surgery with chronic renal failure, and employed hemodialysis (HD) in 5 cases, hemodialysis with extracorporeal ultrafiltration method (HD + ECUM) in 5 cases, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in 3 cases for perioperative management. The perioperative changes of the circulatory blood volume and the fluid-balance, were assumed by positive reaction with varied over 60 mmHg in systolic blood pressure or demanded over double dose of catecholamines in each observed terms until the next day of the patients extubated. The cases with HD or HD + ECUM have changed the blood pressure more frequently (HD cases = 21%, HD + ECUM cases = 19%) than the cases with CAPD (CAPD cases = 3%). We conclude that the each methods are available to manage perioperative dialysis to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting should be employed with some techniques, CAPD will be the most favorable method to maintain the fluid balance stably for patients with severe compromised cardiac function."

The safe infusion volume decreased and the safe electrolyte concentration shifted to a lower osmolality when there was ascites with renal failure than ascites without renal failure. Infusion therapy was performed without deterioration of the water and sodium balance in those patients whose infusion volume and fluid osmolality were in the safety zone. In contrast, ascites retention increased and peripheral edema appeared in patients whose infusion volume and osmolality were out of the safety zone. Therefore, the safety zone should be determined repeatedly during infusion therapy."

CD009647,0,10554048,0,Pharmacokinetics and therapeutic drug monitoring of gentamicin in the elderly.,"Gentamicin is frequently used in elderly patients as serious infection, particularly Gram-negative bacilli, remains one of the major health problems experienced by this age group. A number of physiological changes in drug disposition occur with ageing and potentially these can affect gentamicin pharmacokinetics. In particular, there is a measurable decline in renal function, especially after the aged of 65. Any differences in drug distribution with age are apparently not reflected in gentamicin disposition data, as patients of varying ages have similar volumes of distribution. Seriously ill patients with infections frequently require treatment with many different drugs. Of note, the combination of gentamicin and a beta-lactam antibacterial can result in inactivation. However, there appears to be no published data describing detrimental or beneficial pharmacokinetic interactions between gentamicin and drugs used in the elderly. Nonetheless, gentamicin should be used cautiously in order to prevent potential exacerbation of its nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity. Such problems may occur as a result of coadministration with, for example, amphotericin, cisplatin, vancomycin, foscarnet, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or furosemide (frusemide). The presence of concurrent disease in aged patients (e.g. malignancy, fluid balance disorders and sepsis) may cause problems. In sepsis, for example, the volume of distribution of gentamicin may be increased; however, other pharmacokinetic data are contradictory and inconclusive. Like other aminoglycosides, gentamicin has a narrow therapeutic index and therapeutic drug monitoring has proven to be beneficial, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly. Moreover, there is substantial pharmacokinetic variability in these patients. Recent data support the use of extended interval or once daily doses of gentamicin. It has been suggested that because of a lack of studies for this regimen in the elderly, specific recommendations cannot yet be made. We would argue that some recommendations for its cautious adoption in aged patients could be justified. Suggested procedures for the once daily administration of gentamicin include the use of the 'Hartford' nomogram and the targeted area under the concentration-time curve. The susceptibility of the elderly to aminoglycoside-related nephrotoxicity (and probably ototoxicity) may arise from a decline in renal function and an impaired capacity for cellular repair and regeneration. However, of greater importance is the duration of aminoglycoside therapy and the concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs. Further confirmation of the utility and tolerability of the once daily regimen and other possible approaches to gentamicin therapy in the elderly are essential."
CD009647,0,7198414,0,Spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine: effect of added vasoconstrictors.,"The effect of adding 0.2 ml of 1:1000 epinephrine or 0.5 ml of 1% phenylephrine to 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine in 8% dextrose for spinal anesthesia was assessed in 30 patients in a double-blind study. The addition of phenylephrine gave a small prolongation of the block which was not statistically significant. Although epinephrine produced a greater prolongation, this only reached statistical significance with regard to total duration. Three patients who received solutions that contained a vasopressor had prolonged blocks, but these solutions could not be relied upon to produce consistently a clinically significant increase in duration in individual patients."
CD009647,0,2525094,0,Natriuretic factors and lithium clearance in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).,"Because the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a state of disturbed body fluid volume regulation and altered sodium balance we sought to determine if recently described volume regulatory factors were stimulated in SIADH. We measured atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), endogenous digitalis-like natriuretic factor (EDNF) and urinary free dopamine in SIADH (n = 27). We also determined fractional clearance of lithium (FCLi). The data obtained in SIADH were compared with similar measurements performed in sodium retaining hyponatremias, such as those of heart failure (n = 26), liver cirrhosis (n = 19) and volume contraction (n = 28). We observed: ANP was 19.5 +/- 2.7 fM/ml in SIADH; it was significantly lower than ANP in cardiac failure, but no different from ANP in volume contraction. Urinary free dopamine was 2.2 +/- 0.8 microM/24 h in SIADH; this was significantly higher than in volume contraction and liver cirrhosis. EDNF (259 +/- 42 nM/24 h) and FCLi (21.4 +/- 2%) were both numerically higher in SIADH than in other hyponatremic disorders; however, the differences did not achieve significance. In conclusion, our observations did not establish a specific role of ANP in chronic stable SIADH. As to the importance of EDNF, dopamine and proximal tubular fluid reabsorption (FCLi) additional work using acute volume changes may demonstrate their participation in the renal sodium handling of SIADH more clearly than our study did."
CD009647,0,22007702,0,Clinical efficacy of adapalene (differin(®)) 0.3% gel in Chilean women with cutaneous photoaging.,"Skin photoaging is a concern for many patients today, and it is important for dermatologists to evaluate new therapeutic approaches. This 6-month open-label study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of adapalene 0.3% gel in 40 Latin American women with signs of facial photoaging. Assessments at baseline, week 12, and week 24 included clinical severity grading, measurement of transepidermal water loss, hydration, and elasticity (Cutometer MPA 850®), evaluation of general skin tone and number of wrinkles (VISIA(®) Complexion Analysis System), and ultrasonography to measure changes in skin thickness. There were significant improvements in clinical grading of wrinkles (p < 0.01) with a reduction in mean severity score of 40% in forehead wrinkles, 52% in periorbital wrinkles, and 29% in perioral wrinkles. Melanin, transepidermal water loss, and hydration were improved, as were general skin tone and the number of wrinkles (p < 0.05). Measurement of skin thickness showed a non-significant improvement in the epidermis and dermis and a significant decrease of the elastosis band (11.6% at week 12 and 15.1% at week 24). Adapalene was well tolerated overall, although three patients discontinued the study due to skin irritation in the first month. We conclude that adapalene 0.3% gel is a new safe and effective approach to photoaging."

However, static monitoring of these volumetric parameters has not consistently been shown to be able to predict changes in cardiac index (CI). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a correction of RVEDVi and GEDVi with a measure of the individual contractile reserve, assessed by right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and global ejection fraction, improves the ability of RVEDVi and GEDVi to monitor changes in preload over time in critically ill patients."
CD009647,0,1830872,0,Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in patients with chronic renal failure on maintenance haemodialysis.,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a recently discovered cardiac hormone, is an important regulator of body fluid homeostasis. Twenty patients with established chronic renal failure and on maintenance haemodialysis were studied before and after dialysis with capillary dialysers. ANP was determined by RIA after extraction. Mean (+/- SD) pre-dialysis ANP concentration was 146 +/- 51 pg/ml and decreased significantly during dialysis to 68 +/- 38 pg/ml (p less than 0.001). Per cent and absolute changes in plasma ANP level correlated significantly with concomitant changes in body weight (r = 0.764; p less than 0.001 and r = 0.558; p less than 0.01, resp.) but not with changes in serum creatinine, blood pressure or serum electrolytes. The obtained results indicate that ANP levels in patients with chronic renal failure are elevated mainly due to fluid overload, and the rapid fall in ANP concentration observed during haemodialysis is caused by the removal of excess fluid from the body."

A dose-titration study.,"The blood pressure response to increasing doses of hydrochlorothiazide with or without amiloride was examined in 130 elderly hypertensive patients. After four weeks of placebo, patients were randomly allocated to increasing doses of hydrochlorothiazide or hydrochlorothiazide with amiloride for 12 weeks using a parallel, double-blind study design. Both hydrochlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide with amiloride significantly reduced mean (+/- SEM) baseline supine and standing blood pressure (171 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 and 167 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 mm Hg) to 148 +/- 2/84 +/- 1 and 146 +/- 3/85 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively, at week 16. Amiloride did not exert any additional antihypertensive effect. Only eight patients required hydrochlorothiazide at 100 mg/d, with the remainder responding to 25 to 50 mg/d. Hydrochlorothiazide decreased mean serum potassium level from 4.3 +/- 0.1 mEq/L (4.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/L) during placebo to 4.0 +/- 0.1 mEq/L (4.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/L) at week 16. Ten patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide developed hypokalemia compared with only two receiving hydrochlorothiazide with amiloride. Relatively low doses of hydrochlorothiazide (25 to 50 mg/d) effectively reduce blood pressure in elderly hypertensive patients. Hypokalemia may occur with hydrochlorothiazide alone but is much less common when hydrochlorothiazide is combined with amiloride."

From April, 2002 to March, 2009, AAU calculi were found in 9 patients (0.66) out of 1,365 cases of stones. Three cases were pure, and 6 were mixed stones. We examined the risk factor of this stone generation, ""continuation of malnutrition and dehydration"" were seen in 5, ""continuing urinary tract infection"" was seen in 4 and ""continuation of super-saturation of uric acid in urine"" was seen in 3 cases. All the patients with ""continuation of malnutrition and dehydration"" were women, and 4 patients had a history of severe body weight loss. 2 patients were dieting consciously, and the other 2 were eating a poorly balanced diet unconsciously. One patient had no notable past history, but malnutrition was detected in blood examination. It is suggested that AAU calculi is generated even by dieting at a usual level. Compared with the report in the United States, obesity and inflammatory bowel disease were not major risk factors, and ""continuation of malnutrition and dehydration"" is the major factor in Japan."

CD009647,0,22892852,0,"Additional hemodynamic measurements with an esophageal Doppler monitor: a preliminary report of compliance, force, kinetic energy, and afterload in the clinical setting.","The esophageal Doppler monitor (EDM) is a minimally-invasive hemodynamic device which evaluates both cardiac output (CO), and fluid status, by estimating stroke volume (SV) and calculating heart rate (HR). The measurement of these parameters is based upon a continuous and accurate approximation of distal thoracic aortic blood flow. Furthermore, the peak velocity (PV) and mean acceleration (MA), of aortic blood flow at this anatomic location, are also determined by the EDM. The purpose of this preliminary report is to examine additional clinical hemodynamic calculations of: compliance (C), kinetic energy (KE), force (F), and afterload (TSVR(i)). These data were derived using both velocity-based measurements, provided by the EDM, as well as other contemporaneous physiologic parameters. Data were obtained from anesthetized patients undergoing surgery or who were in a critical care unit. A graphical inspection of these measurements is presented and discussed with respect to each patient's clinical situation. When normalized to each of their initial values, F and KE both consistently demonstrated more discriminative power than either PV or MA. The EDM offers additional applications for hemodynamic monitoring. Further research regarding the accuracy, utility, and limitations of these parameters is therefore indicated."

CD009647,0,1735393,0,Acid-base status following glycine absorption in transurethral surgery.,"Forty patients were studied at precisely timed 10 min intervals during transurethral prostatic resection under epidural analgesia. Blood gases, serum sodium, and volumetric irrigating-fluid balance were measured. A decrease in the serum sodium level of less than 5 mmol litre-1 was recorded in 28 patients (the 'normal TUR' group). In 12 patients, the decrease was 5 mmol litre-1 or more, which corresponded to an average absorption of irrigant of 1 litre of 2.2% glycine solution (range 0.6-2.9; the 'absorption' group). Mild metabolic acidosis often developed during the operations, but this was of similar degree in the two groups. It was concluded that uptake of irrigating fluid containing glycine does not alter the acid-base status so long as the TUR syndrome does not develop."

Natriuresis decreases the total blood volume through osmotic diuresis and increases the risk of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm. In such patients, hypervolemic therapy is difficult to achieve without causing hyponatremia because sodium replacement provokes further natriuresis and osmotic diuresis.

CD009647,0,11573580,0,Clinical evaluation of circulating blood volume in critically ill patients--contribution of a clinical scoring system.,"The circulating blood volume (CBV) of critically ill patients may be difficult to estimate on the basis of history and physical examination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of seven clinical signs and central venous pressure (CVP) to predict CBV in critically ill patients; CBV was evaluated with the [125I]human serum albumin technique. A scoring system was constructed using a combination of independence Bayes method and logistic regression. Sixty-eight patients constituted a 'model development' sample and 30 patients a validation sample. Thirty-six patients (53%) in the model development sample were found to have a low CBV (measured CBV at least 10% lower than the predicted mean normal CBV). Neither the haemodynamic variables monitored in ICU, nor the spot urinary sodium concentrations were different between patients with and without a low CBV. Individually, none of the clinical signs tested have a good positive or negative predictive value. For CVP, only extreme values seem to have clinical significance. To construct the score, the signs tested were ranked according to their discriminating efficacy. The probability of a low CBV was obtained by adding the weights of each sign tested and converting the score obtained into a probability. On a validation sample of 30 patients, the predictions are reliable as assessed by Z statistics ranging between -2 and +2. Our results suggest that: (1) individually, no clinical sign presented a clinical useful predictive value; and (2) a clinical scoring system may be helpful for the evaluation of CBV in critically ill patients."
CD009647,0,12631373,0,"Effect of icodextrin on volume status, blood pressure and echocardiographic parameters: a randomized study.","Overhydration is a risk factor for hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in peritoneal dialysis patients. Recently, a high prevalence of subclinical overhydration was observed in peritoneal dialysis patients. Aim of the present open-label randomized study was to assess the effect of a icodextrin 7.5% solution on fluid status [extracellular water (ECW) bromide dilution], blood pressure regulation (24-hour ambulatory measurements) and echocardiographic parameters during a study period of 4 months, and to relate the effect to peritoneal membrane characteristics (dialysate/plasma creatinine ratio). Forty peritoneal dialysis patients (22 treated with icodextrin, 18 controls) were randomized to either treatment with icodextrin during the long dwell or standard glucose solutions. Thirty-two patients (19 treated with icodextrin, 13 controls] completed the study. The use of icodextrin resulted in a significant increase in daily ultrafiltration volume (744 +/- 767 mL vs. 1670 +/- 1038 mL; P = 0.012) and a decrease in ECW (17.5 +/- 5.2 L vs. 15.8 +/- 3.8 L; P = 0.035). Also the change in ECW between controls and patients treated with icodextrin was significant (-1.7 +/- 3.3 L vs. +0.9 +/- 2.2 L; P = 0.013). The effect of icodextrin on ECW was not related to peritoneal membrane characteristics, but significantly related to the fluid state of the patients (ECW:height) (r = -0.72; P < 0.0001). Left ventricular mass (LVM) decreased significantly in the icodextrin-treated group (241 +/- 53 grams vs. 228 +/- 42 grams; P = 0.03), but not in the control group. In this randomized open-label study, the use of icodextrin resulted in a significant reduction in ECW and LVM. The effect of icodextrin on ECW was not related to peritoneal membrane characteristics, but was related to the initial fluid state of the patient."
CD009647,0,22278627,0,Daily dialysis reduces pulse wave velocity in chronic hemodialysis patients.,"Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Dialysis patients show cyclic changes in PWV related to their hydration status and blood pressure. Our aim is to assess the impact of daily dialysis on PWV. We performed a randomized crossover study of 60 patients who underwent standard hemodialysis (HD) three times per week for at least 6 months. Patients were classified into three groups according to their PWV values before (pre-) and after (post-) HD, with a cutoff value of 12 m s(-1), as follows: the low-low (LL) group had normal pre-HD and post-HD PWV; the high-low (HL) group had high pre-HD PWV and normal post-HD PWV; and the high-high (HH) group had high pre- and post-HD PWV. All patients continued standard HD for 2 weeks. A total of 10 patients from each group were randomly assigned to continue standard HD for 1 week and then underwent daily dialysis for 1 week. The remaining 10 patients underwent daily dialysis for 1 week and then underwent standard HD for 1 week. PWV values were measured before and 1 h after each dialysis session. With daily dialysis treatment, 2 of 20 patients (10%) moved from the PWV-HH group to the PWV-HL group, whereas 18 of 20 patients (90%) moved from the PWV-HL group to the PWV-LL group (P = 0.030). Daily dialysis reduces PWV in the ESRD patients. As PWV is a strong predictor of mortality in ESRD and has cyclic variations in patients who are on standard HD, we believe that daily dialysis may be used in patients with high PWV levels to reduce their mortality risk."

However, considering that the average survival duration after HD induction is increasing, the adequacy of aggressive surgical treatment of thoracic aneurysms was investigated. Seventeen consecutive surgeries for 16 patients with ESRD with disease of the thoracic aorta performed between 1998 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. As an intraoperative renal replacement therapy, prior to 2001, HD was performed in six cases and, after 2002, continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) was performed in nine cases. In two cases, no renal replacement therapy was performed during surgery. No operative and hospital mortality occurred, despite challenging indications for surgery like emergency setting (52.5%), history of previous aortic surgery (41.2%) and aortic arch surgeries (58.8%). The five-year survival rate was 62.9%. Median follow-up was 38.8 months (1-117.6). According to this excellent outcome, surgical strategy for ESRD patients with disease of the thoracic aorta should be more aggressive than currently indicated because surgery can be safely performed by means of appropriate application of intraoperative HD or CHDF in order to give sufficient amounts of blood products and manage the water and electrolyte balance."

Part II: Clinical and therapeutic aspects.,"Once regarded as medical curiosities, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have achieved a remarkable change in status recently and today are among the more compelling of all human illnesses. The cause(s) of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not known. Genetic, environmental, microbial, and immunologic factors are involved, but the precise mechanisms are obscure. The incidence of ulcerative colitis is relatively stable, while Crohn's disease continues to increase in frequency. In 10% to 15% of patients, it is hard to differentiate between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis, however, problems with diagnosis usually resolve with time and repeated examinations. In part I of his two-part monograph on IBD, Dr. Kirsner addressed the nature and pathogenesis of the disease. Increased study of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in recent years has generated new knowledge regarding their etiology. Part I focused on microbial, immunologic, and genetic mechanisms of, and the inflammatory process involved in the disease. In this part, Dr. Kirsner deals with the clinical features, course, and management of IBD, based on the author's 55 years of experience with these problems and supplemented by critical examination of the recent (1988-1990) literature. Particular attention is directed to the symptoms and physical findings of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The laboratory, radiologic, endoscopic, and pathologic features, and the many systemic complications. IBDs are mimicked by several enterocolonic infections and other conditions making differential diagnosis necessary. Inflammatory bowel disease in children and the elderly conforms to conventional clinical patterns modified by the health circumstances of the respective age groups. Because the cause of IBD has not been established, current medical therapy is facilitative and supportive rather than curative. The principles of medical treatment are approximately the same for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Treatment emphasizes a program rather than a drug and also considers the individuality of the therapeutic response. A clearer understanding of dietary and nutritional needs, including hyperalimentation and electrolyte and fluid balance, aids treatment. Antidiarrheal and antispasmodal preparation and sedatives are prescribed for symptom relief. The bowel inflammation is controlled with sulfasalazine or the newer 5-amino-salicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds, antibacterial drugs for complications of Crohn's disease and IBD, adrenocortical steroids, and the immunosuppressive compounds 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), azathioprine, and cyclosporine, as determined in each patient.

CD009647,0,1109248,0,Clinical implications of warfarin interactions with five sedatives.,"The intensity, uniformity and time course of anticoagulant interference by phenobarbital, secobarbital, glutethimide, chloral hydrate and methaqualone were systematically investigated in 16 patients receiving coumarin therapy. Each subject received an individualized fixed daily dose of warfarin and served as his own pre- and postsedative treatment control. Prothrombin times were measured four times weekly during five long-term experiments. Anticoagulant inhibition was observed during the administration of phenobarbital, secobarbital and glutethimide; there was no significant change in prothrombin test results during the trials of chloral hydrate and methaqualone. Barbiturates and glutethimide should not be administered to patients receiving coumarin drugs. The concurrent use of drugs from these groups is decreasing according to a survey of 200 hospital medical records. Chloral hydrate and methaqualone interact pharmacologically with orally administered anticoagulant agents, but the effect is not clinically significant. It is concluded that chloral hydrate and methaqualone may be administered safely without additional caution in prothrombin test monitoring during oral anticoagulant therapy."

CD009647,0,10207767,0,Fluid balance therapy of nocturia in women.,"Nocturia is a common and troublesome symptom in otherwise healthy elderly men and women. Nocturnal polyuria (an excessive nighttime urine output) has been documented to be a common finding in healthy men with lower urinary tract symptoms. It is also a presenting feature of various medical conditions, such as renal failure, hypercalcemia and diabetes. Fluid balance therapy is an option in those whose nocturia is secondary to nocturnal polyuria. If a reduction in fluid intake fails to reduce nocturnal frequency a variety of drug treatments may be beneficial. Several studies have confirmed the efficacy of intranasal DDAVP, a synthetic analog of antidiuretic hormone, in both healthy patients and those with neuropathic bladders, although fluid overload and hyponatremia are potential side effects. Other drug treatments include early evening diuretics, such as frusemide or bumetanide. More recently imipramine has shown therapeutic benefit in young adults with enuresis, and might prove to be useful in the elderly with nocturnal polyuria."

CD009647,0,9558859,0,[An analysis of the mechanism of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia following resection of thoracic esophageal cancer in terms of hepatic venous oxygen saturation and excessive systemic reactions].,"Hepatic venous oxygen saturation (ShvO2), parameters of systemic circulation and cytokine (Interleukin 6) (IL-6)) level were measured in 21 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer in order to analyze the mechanism of occurrence of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia (PHB). ShvO2 fell during operation, especially during intrathoracic procedures, and a significant correlation was noted between the total time during which ShvO2 was below 60% and the postoperative peak serum bilirubin level (peak-Bil) (r = 0.595, p = 0.0037). Patients with PHB (group H) had worse systemic circulation and a lower oxygen supply postoperatively than patients without PHB (group N). Body weight and water balance recovered earlier in group N. Postoperatively, numbers of peripheral lymphocytes and platelets changed lower in group H, while CRP and IL-6 changed higher in group H. Furthermore, a significant correlation was noted between the IL-6 level just after operation and peak-Bil (r = 0.669, p = 0.0006). These results suggests PHB results from intraoperative liver hypoxia and poor postoperative systemic circulation. Individual severeness of reactions to the operative stress, excessive or adequate, plays a role in the occurrence of PHB as well."

CD009647,0,2279574,0,The role of central haemodynamic monitoring in abdominal aortic surgery. A prospective randomised study.,"To test the hypothesis that central haemodynamic monitoring is not necessary in all patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery, a prospective randomised study in 40 consecutive patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic surgery was carried out. Patients with unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction (less than or equal to 6 months), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 0.50 were excluded. Twenty-one patients had perioperative central haemodynamic monitoring while 19 patients had central venous pressure monitoring alone. Parameters studied included, perioperative haemodynamics and fluid balance, perioperative cardiac drug administration, operation time and clamp time, postoperative renal function, incidence of postoperative ventilation and line complications, duration of hospital and ICU stay, and 30 day postoperative outcome. Results obtained were compared with a high risk group of patients (LVEF less than 0.50) undergoing similar surgery. Statistical analysis failed to show any difference in outcome for any variable measured in either low risk group. All serious postoperative cardiac complications occurred in patients with LVEF less than 0.50 (P less than 0.0001). These data suggest that patients with LVEF greater than or equal to 0.50 are at low risk of developing postoperative cardiac complications and can be successfully managed perioperatively without the added potential risks and costs of central haemodynamic monitoring."
CD009647,0,18471172,0,Association between arterial stiffness and peritoneal small solute transport rate.,"While cardiovascular disease accounts for 40-50% of the mortality in dialysis patients, and while a high peritoneal transport in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is an independent predictor of outcome, it is unclear if there are any links. Aortic stiffness has become established as a cardiovascular risk factor. We thus studied pulse wave velocity (PWV) in CAPD patients to explore the possible link between peritoneal small solute transport and aortic stiffness. CAPD patients (n = 76, 27 M/49 F) in our center were included in the present study. Aortic stiffness was assessed by brachial pulse pressure (PP) and carotid-femoral PWV. Patients' peritoneal small solute transport rate was assessed by D/P(cr) at 4 h. Extracellular water over total body water (E/T ratio) was assessed by means of bioimpedance analysis. C-reactive protein was also measured. Carotid-femoral PWV was positively associated with patients' age (r = 0.555; P < 0.01), time on peritoneal dialysis (r = 0.332; P < 0.01), diabetic status (r = 0.319; P < 0.01), D/P(cr) (r = 0.241; P < 0.05), PP (r = 0.475; P < 0.01), and E/T (r = 0.606; P < 0.01). In a multivariate regression analysis, carotid-femoral PWV was independently determined by E/T (P < 0.01), PP (P < 0.01), age (P < 0.01), and D/P(cr) (P < 0.05). D/P(cr), in addition to E/T, age, and PP, was an independent predictor of elevated carotid-femoral PWV in CAPD patients, suggesting that there might be a link between high aortic stiffness and increased peritoneal small solute transport rate."
CD009647,0,6139011,0,Pathophysiologic considerations in the treatment of the elderly hypertensive patient.,"Changes that occur as a consequence of aging can influence the development of hypertension and its complications. Such changes may adversely affect cardiac function and tissue blood flow and the responsiveness of the circulation to antihypertensive therapy. The distribution and metabolism of antihypertensive drugs may also be influenced by aging. These factors can complicate the pharmacologic management of the elderly hypertensive patient and may lead to a higher incidence of side effects. A conservative approach to the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension is indicated because the merits of therapy remain uncertain. Although standard stepped-care treatment can be used, certain special precautions should be considered. Lower doses of medications are generally required in elderly than in young hypertensives. Hypokalemia and volume contraction are the more frequent and more clinically important complications of diuretic therapy, while sluggishness, sexual dysfunction, or decreased mentation are more commonly observed with sympatholytic agents. Complications from beta-adrenergic blockers also are relatively frequent in elderly persons. Calcium-channel blockers, although not approved in the United States for the treatment of hypertension, may be beneficial in these patients. When diastolic hypertension is also present, a vigorous approach to lowering blood pressure should be used because the benefits of such therapy have been well documented. However, similar precautions should be used in these patients as in those with systolic hypertension."

A computed tomography scan of the head revealed no subarachnoid haemorrhage. Based on the hypothesis that the symptoms resulted from an infarction in the brain stem, the previous medication with Aspirin was continued. After repeated vomitus hypotensive dehydration developed and was adequately treated. Because of confusion, elevated white blood counts and signs of meningism, a spinal puncture was performed. Only the serology for Borrelia-IgG was positive, therefore the patient received Rocephin. During treatment only the ptosis persisted, therefore the substitution with sodium and the medication with Prednisone were stopped. Afterwards the symptoms reappeared and the laboratory results showed insufficiency of the pituitary. A magnetic resonance scan showed a microadenoma of the pituitary with local bleeding. Nine months after pituitary apoplexy, with hormonal substitution only a divergent strabism on the left side persisted. Clinical findings, course and therapy of pituitary apoplexy are discussed."

We investigated whether the efficacy of an urea-containing topical preparation could be improved by the addition of vitamins and ceramides. For this an intra-individual comparative study was conducted on 10 subjects with healthy skin. The application of the combination preparation containing urea, vitamins and ceramides for 2 weeks was significantly superior to the urea-only preparation in respect to reduction of transepidermal water loss and skin hydration levels. This improved efficacy was associated with a stronger up-regulation of the transcriptional expression of differentiation genes in keratinocytes in the treated skin areas. While both preparations caused an increased expression of the genes encoding transglutaminase-1, involucrin, loricrin and filaggrin, this increase was significantly greater in those skin areas treated with the combination preparation. This study indicates that the efficacy of topical preparations containing urea can be enhanced by the incorporation of ceramides and vitamins."
CD009647,0,7992947,0,[Hemodynamic diagnosis of aortocaval fistula complicating abdominal aortic aneurysm].,"A 78-year-old man with a history of hypertension was admitted for a fall with back pain. The blood pressure was at 110/50 mmHg and the pulse at 115 b.min-1. A pulsatile abdominal mass was palpated. No signs of respiratory insufficiency or congestive heart failure were found. The diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm was promptly confirmed by echography. Before laparotomy, a pulmonary artery catheter was inserted for haemodynamic monitoring which showed a high cardiac output, low systemic vascular resistances, increased pulmonary artery wedge pressure and a high SvO2 (93%). This was not consistent with a hypovolaemic shock but rather an aortocaval fistula. After incision and aortic clamping, surgical procedure consisted of transaortic closure of the fistula and restoration of arterial continuity with a prosthetic graft. Initial control of venous bleeding was obtained by passing a Foley's catheter distally and by clamping the vena cava. The postoperative course was initially satisfactory. The patient was extubated, but remained with a major renal insufficiency. After a stay of 15 days in the intensive care unit, he died from nosocomial pneumonia. Aortocaval fistulas are either traumatic or spontaneous. Spontaneous fistulas are more common, and in about 90% of the cases result from a rupture of an atherosclerotic aortic aneurysm. Clinical findings include signs of high cardiac output symptoms of venous hypertension and regional arterial insufficiency. Haemodynamic changes can be of value for the recognition of an aortocaval fistula. Most authors emphasize the importance of preoperative diagnosis, allowing the use of appropriate operative techniques and a prompt control of the fistula. This could decrease haemodynamic instability and transfusion requirements."
CD009647,0,10147702,0,The influence of pulsatile and nonpulsatile extracorporeal circulation on fluid retention following coronary artery bypass grafting.,"Thirty male patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were divided into two groups, group I receiving pulsatile perfusion, group II nonpulsatile perfusion. A double roller pump system for extracorporeal circulation was employed. Intra- and postoperative fluid balances and bodyweight gains were controlled under clinical conditions. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to clinical data, operative procedure, perfusion parameters, drug treatment or intensive care treatment. The intra-operative mean fluid balance of group I was 794.0ml (66%) lower than that of group II, while the balance 24 hours postoperatively was 136.7ml (37%) lower in group I. Thus, the total mean fluid balance for the pulsatile group was 931.0ml (59%) lower than the nonpulsatile group, in accordance with the bodyweights, which showed a 954.0g (63%) lower outcome in the pulsatile group. Less supplementary volume and higher urine production were the main factors. It appears that volume saved during pulsatile ECC need not be replaced postoperatively. These findings indicate that pulsatile perfusion leads to diminished fluid overloading, which could be an important advantage, especially for high-risk patients."
CD009647,0,17173589,0,Atopic xerosis: employment of noninvasive biophysical instrumentation for the functional analyses of the mildly abnormal stratum corneum and for the efficacy assessment of skin care products.,"The subtle dryness of the skin surrounding the lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD) is called atopic dry skin or atopic xerosis (AX). AX is more susceptible to the development of AD skin lesions under various environmental stimuli than the clinically normal skin of the people who have or have had or will have AD, which might be called normal atopic skin (NAS) that shows no functional differences as compared to the skin of normal individuals. Routine histopathologic studies of AX that involve the invasive procedures of biopsy are not so helpful in clarifying the underlying pathogenesis. Modern, noninvasive biophysical instrumentation provides rich and quantitative information about various functional aspects of skin. The stratum corneum (SC) of AX reveals not only decreased hydration but also mildly impaired barrier function demonstrable as an increase in transepidermal water loss, elevated pH values, and an increased turnover rate of the SC consisting of thick layers of smaller-sized corneocytes. These data suggest that AX is related to mildly increased epidermal proliferation as a result of the presence of subclinical cutaneous inflammation. Although AX skin does not display any impairment in the recovery of barrier function after physical skin irritation by tape-stripping, it produces a much more severe, long-lasting inflammatory response together with a delay in barrier repair after chemical irritation such as that induced by sodium lauryl sulphate. The SC of AX is biochemically characterized by reduction in the amounts of ceramides, especially ceramide I, sebum lipids, and water-soluble amino acids. None of these changes in SC functions are seen in NAS, which includes not only the normal-looking skin of AD patients long after regression of all active lesions but also of latent atopic skin such as neonates who later develop AD. This suggests that all of the observed functional as well as biochemical abnormalities of AX are a reflection of subclinical inflammation. The presence of the underlying inflammation in AX also differentiates it from senile xerosis. The mildly impaired SC functions of AX can be improved by daily repeated applications of effective moisturizers, i.e., corneotherapy, which is effective in preventing the exacerbating progression of AX to AD resulting from inadvertent scratching of the skin that facilitates the penetration of environmental allergens into the skin. The biophysical confirmation of such efficacy of moisturizers, including cosmetic bases on the mildly impaired barrier function and decreased water-holding capacity of the SC of AX, definitely substantiates the importance of skin care for the cosmetic skin problems that affect every individual in the cold and dry season ranging from late autumn to early spring."
CD009647,0,19714880,0,Quantitative analysis of N-linked glycoproteins in tear fluid of climatic droplet keratopathy by glycopeptide capture and iTRAQ.,"Glycoproteins are potentially important biomarkers of disease and therapeutic targets. In particular, the N-linked glycoproteins are a focus of interest as they can be found in the extracellular environment and body fluids. In this study, we have sampled the tears, the extracellular fluid of the epithelial cells covering the surface of the eye, of patients with climatic droplet keratopathy (CDK) using tears of unaffected normal patients for comparison. Prefractionation of the tear sample used a hydrazide-resin capture method, and the previously N-glycosylated peptides were then subjected to two-dimensional nano-LC-nano-ESI-MS/MS analysis to obtain peptide fragmentation patterns for identification through protein database searches. We have identified a total of 43 unique N-glycoproteins, 19 of which have not previously been reported in tear fluid. In addition, we have quantitatively compared N-glycoprotein profiles in tear fluid of patients with CDK to tears of nondiseased controls using glycopeptide capture, iTRAQ labeling and 2D nano-LC-nano-ESI-MS/MS analysis. In tears of CDK patients, increased levels of four N-glycosylated proteins including haptoglobin (at sites N207, N211 and N241), polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (at sites N83, N90, N135, N186, N421, and N469), immunoglobulin J chain (at site N49) and an uncharacterized protein DKFZp686M08189 (at site N470), as well as a decrease in the N-glycosylation level of one N-glycosylated protein, lacritin (at site N119) were observed. However, the overall levels of these five proteins showed no appreciable changes between control and CDK samples. The findings could be clinically significant in terms of disease etiology and biomarkers."
CD009647,0,18243818,0,Dysregulation of pulsatility in aging IV. Pulsatile signaling and cardiovascular aging: functions and regulation of natriuretic peptide signaling.,"Atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) are cardiac hormones connecting heart and kidney and playing a key role in hydromineral and hemodynamic homeostasis. In contrast with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, circulating ANP and BNP are not temporally related with rapid eye movement (REM)-nonREM sleep cycles, autonomic activity, or blood pressure. Cardiac natriuretic peptides are secreted in a pulsatile manner, with short periods of 20-48min, in normal as well as in pathological conditions. The frequency of pulses seems to be unchanged with aging, whereas the absolute amplitude of the oscillations seems to increase, most likely as a result of an increase in the plasma hormone levels observed in elderly. Enhanced cardiac secretion and decreased degradation partly explain the higher ANP and BNP concentrations observed in elderly. Despite higher levels, the natriuretic system seems to loose efficiency at the renal site in elderly. This more probably relies on reduced target organ responsivity and not on deeply altered hormone secretion. Here we review the impact of aging on the renal effects of the natriuretic peptides, and point out the lack of knowledge on the precise interactions between the ultradian rhythms of the systems involved in salt and water balance in elderly. Additional studies focusing on potential age-induced alterations of the intracellular signaling pathway are now needed."

The mean area under the pleural Pt concentration versus time curve (AUC) [12.83 (S.D. 4.06) mg.min/ml] was about 50 times greater than that detected in plasma [0.27 (0.03) mg.min/ml], indicating a clear pharmacological advantage for this route of administration. The mean plasma total Pt concentration was 1.1 micrograms/ml and the apparent total body clearance was 268 (101) ml/min. Platinum plasma pharmacokinetic data measured following intrapleural cisplatin administration (4 patients) were compared with those observed in 7 patients treated intravenously with the same dose of cisplatin (90 mg/m2) under the same modalities of hydration. Intrapleural administration of cisplatin resulted in significantly lower plasma total partial AUC (P less than 0.05) and prolonged plasma levels of filterable Pt compared with intravenous administration. No difference between the two routes of cisplatin administration in the renal clearance (S.D.) of filterable Pt [132 (64) ml/min and 122 (39) ml/min for intravenous and intrapleural cisplatin, respectively] were observed. None of the mesothelioma patients developed clinical symptoms or signs of pleural inflammation.

In primary adrenocortical insufficiency, there is a deficiency of both cortisol and aldosterone with characteristic clinical and laboratory findings. In contrast, with a pituitary disorder there is isolated hypocortisolism, because its production is dependent on pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), whereas aldosterone production is controlled by extracellular fluid volume, renin and serum potassium.

Extensive lavage of the peritoneal cavity should also be carried out. Energetic fluid replacement with careful monitoring of the fluid and electrolyte balance is essential before, during and after the surgical procedure.

Interstitial fluid was collected via subcutaneously implanted double nylon wicks and Pif was measured with the 'wick-in-needle' technique. Measurements were made preoperatively and 1 1/2 to 8 hours (mean 4 hours) after termination of extracorporeal circulation. Pif rose to 2.3 mmHg above the pre-bypass level. COPpl concomitantly fell from 22.2 to 14.4 and COPif from 12.4 to 10.1 mmHg. These changes were statistically significant. Although the relatively large COPpl drop resulted in a net rise of 3.2 mmHg in filtration pressure, the incidence of pulmonary complications was low and no subcutaneous edema was discernible. The fall in COPif and rise in Pif may be regarded as important edema-preventing mechanisms."

We have investigated the effects of 10 mg salbutamol, nebulised in air, on blood gas tensions, heart rate and plasma potassium (K+), when administered alone to 9 patients with severe chronic obstructive airway disease and then in combination with a therapeutic dose of oral sustained-release theophylline to 5 of them on 2 separate occasions. No significant reductions in PaO2 were observed with either treatments. Heart rate increased significantly from 77.8 +/- 3.7 beats/min (mean +/- s.e.m.) at baseline to a peak of 87.1 +/- 4.4 beats/min at 45 min (p less than 0.001) with salbutamol alone and there was a similar trend of increase after combined therapy. K+ decreased significantly from a baseline of 4.0 +/- 0.3 to a minimum of 3.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/l at 90 min (p less than 0.001) with combined therapy but did not change significantly with single therapy. No subject developed any significant cardiac arrhythmias on either occasion. Although the number of subjects studied is small, our data suggest that air-driven nebulised high-dose salbutamol may be safe in the treatment of severe chronic obstructive airway disease but when combined with oral theophylline, a significant fall in plasma potassium may occur. This could be of clinical significance in hypokalaemic patients. When combination treatment is used, monitoring of plasma potassium is recommended."

Serum renin activity decreased (-0.60 +/- 0.26 ng/ml/min) in these patients but not in the six patients in whom body weight remained unchanged (0.19 +/- 0.07 ng/ml/min; p < 0.03). Ileal and urinary volume remained stable. In patients with high ileal output, R-ORS supplementation improved Na and K balance. The association of increased body weight with decreased serum renin concentrations suggests that a positive water balance also occurred."

CD009647,0,15353454,0,Capillary leakage in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.,"Cardiopulmonary bypass causes a systemic inflammatory response, which can lead to capillary leak syndrome. In 15 adults undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, we determined the volume and peak time of capillary leakage from the measurements of extracellular fluid volume and circulating blood volume taken preoperatively, at various intervals up to 24 hours after surgery, and on the 7th postoperative day. Extracellular fluid volume rose from 15.5 +/- 2.7 L preoperatively to a peak 4 hours after surgery of 18.3 +/- 3.2 L and remained elevated at 24 hours. Circulating blood volume fell from 4.10 +/- 0.68 L preoperatively to 3.20 +/- 0.58 L at the end of surgery. Fluid administered intraoperatively did not raise the circulating blood volume. Intraoperative fluid balance was positive at 2.62 +/- 0.72 L but negative at all time points postoperatively. There was significant postoperative capillary leakage, increasing from 4.7% +/- 2.3% of body weight at the end of surgery to a peak 4 hours later of 5.4% +/- 2.0% and falling to 2.8% +/- 3.3% at 24 hours. This knowledge of the pattern of change in capillary leakage after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass might serve as a valuable guide for postoperative management."
CD009647,0,12111177,0,Diverse patterns of acid-base abnormalities associated with a modified sigmoid neobladder.,"In this study, we analyzed the pattern of metabolic acidosis in patients following the construction of a sigmoid neobladder and then search for the risk factors which affecting this. In 23 men aged 43-73 years and nine women aged 49-74 years who underwent sigmoid neobladder surgery, we performed physical examinations and blood tests every 3 months for 13-75 months (38.7+/-16.6: mean+/-SD). We monitored acid-base balance, serum electrolytes, creatinine, lipid and liver function in patients for up to 6 years postoperatively. Creatinine clearance over 24 h was determined preoperatively. According to pH and base excess measured during follow-up, patients were classified into three groups (normal, 17 patients; temporary acidosis, eight patients; persistent acidosis, seven patients). Patients with temporary acidosis could compensate spontaneously by 1 year without being given sodium bicarbonate; those with persistent acidosis could not compensate spontaneously and five of them required medication with sodium bicarbonate after 1 year. Serum creatinine in patients with persistent acidosis was consistently higher during follow-up than in the other two groups. Preoperative creatinine clearances in the normal, temporary, and persistent groups were 94.25+/-27.47, 95.19+/-18.63, and 69.18+/-16.18 ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively, being significantly lower in the persistent group ( P<0.05). In this group, patients with creatinine clearances less than 70 ml/min/1.73 m(2) could not compensate for metabolic acidosis. Normal and temporary groups showed different changes of serum chloride and bicarbonate during follow-up (respectively higher and lower) although the renal functions of the two groups were similar. Chloride and bicarbonate varied reciprocally with pH and base excess. Temporal hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis was observed until a year after surgery. In conclusion, temporary acidosis can be caused in some patients in spite of normal renal function, although it is difficult to predict it. In addition, careful follow-up is required, especially in patients with a creatinine clearance <70 ml/min/1.73 m(2) who can encounter persistent acidosis."
CD009647,0,2501970,0,Renal function in chronic lithium-treated patients.,"We investigated the renal function (urine volume, glomerular filtration rate, urinary osmolality and proteinuria) of 50 patients chronically treated with lithium carbonate for major affective disorder. No patient had any alteration in the parameters considered. No relationship was found between any of the parameters studied and duration of illness or lithium levels, both in serum and red blood cells. These results were confirmed by the administration of the DDAVP test to 10 patients of the original sample; no alteration of concentration ability was found. We suggest that the discrepancy between our findings and those of most authors was a result of the serum lithium level of our patient sample, which was lower than that usually used in other studies."
CD009647,0,7625329,0,Current surgical treatment of valvular heart disease.,"Surgery for valvular heart disease has undergone important refinements during the past several years. The general indications for valvular surgery are the presence of symptoms that interfere with the patient's lifestyle and that cannot be controlled with medical therapy, and indications of a threat to continued survival, such as angina, dyspnea, effort syncope or progressive impairment of ventricular contractility. Infective endocarditis may also be an indication for valvular surgery in patients with congestive heart failure, recurrent embolism, persistent infection despite antibiotic therapy, large vegetations or progressive conduction defects. Surgical procedures for the treatment of valvular heart disease include reconstruction techniques and valve replacement procedures. Reconstructive surgery minimizes the amount of materials that must be implanted. Advances in myocardial preservation have reduced the risk of such complex cardiac surgical procedures as multiple valve replacements and valve replacements combined with coronary artery bypass surgery. Follow-up care is important to monitor valve function, fluid balance and anticoagulation."

CD009647,0,10794585,0,Evaluation and treatment of swallowing impairments.,"Swallowing disorders are common, especially in the elderly, and may cause dehydration, weight loss, aspiration pneumonia and airway obstruction. These disorders may affect the oral preparatory, oral propulsive, pharyngeal and/or esophageal phases of swallowing. Impaired swallowing, or dysphagia, may occur because of a wide variety of structural or functional conditions, including stroke, cancer, neurologic disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. A thorough history and a careful physical examination are important in the diagnosis and treatment of swallowing disorders. The physical examination should include the neck, mouth, oropharynx and larynx, and a neurologic examination should also be performed. Supplemental studies are usually required. A videofluorographic swallowing study is particularly useful for identifying the pathophysiology of a swallowing disorder and for empirically testing therapeutic and compensatory techniques. Manometry and endoscopy may also be necessary. Disorders of oral and pharyngeal swallowing are usually amenable to rehabilitative measures, which may include dietary modification and training in specific swallowing techniques. Surgery is rarely indicated. In patients with severe disorders, it may be necessary to bypass the oral cavity and pharynx entirely and provide enteral or parenteral nutrition."

CD009647,0,22515643,0,Optimal fluid control can normalize cardiovascular risk markers and limit left ventricular hypertrophy in thrice weekly dialysis patients.,"Increased hemodialysis frequency can make fluid overload easier to treat, although most patients are still treated thrice weekly. Chronic fluid overload is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and elevated serum cardiac biomarkers, recognized as mortality risk factors. Serum cardiac troponin T (cTnT), N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), left ventricular mass index by cardiac magnetic imaging, and ambulatory blood pressure was measured in 30 thrice weekly hemodiafiltration patients. Time-averaged fluid overload (TAFO) was quantified by bioimpedance spectroscopy. In the study group, left ventricular hypertrophy was found to be 26% by cardiac magnetic resonance. Ambulatory blood pressure was 130 mmHg (112-151) requiring a low equivalent dose of medication of 0.25 units (0-1). Significantly, lower levels of left ventricular mass index (P < 0.05) were associated in those patients with TAFO <1 L or NT-proBNP <1200 pg/mL or cTnT <0.1 ug/L. In the subgroups, 16 patients had normal cTnT (<0.03 ug/L), 16 patients had NT-proBNP <400 pg/mL, and 20 patients had TAFO <1 L. Nine patients had both cTnT <0.03 ug/L and NT-proBNP <400 pg/mL. Normally hydrated thrice-weekly hemodiafiltration patients can have cardiac biomarker and TAFO levels indistinguishable from the normal healthy population. Obtaining TAFO by bioimpedance monitoring can offer a practical alternative to serum cardiac biomarkers."

We report a case of a 66-yr-old woman who had severe asthenia, diffuse skin hitching and abdominal pain. The physical examination revealed poor general conditions, irritability, pallor, dehydration and diffuse skin scratching lesions. The abdomen was painful at left hypochondrium and the Giordano's maneuvre was positive on both sides. A peripheral blood smear showed the presence of big rare lymphocytes with dyshomogeneous chromatin and granulated and hyperbasophil cytoplasm. She underwent abdominal ultrasonography which showed the presence of a hypoechogenic ovoidal mass (major diameter 8.4 cm) within the splenorenal left region. The presence of the suprarenal mass was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan which showed an enlarged left adrenal gland (8.1 x 6.2 cm) of solid structure. The right adrenal gland was also enlarged and of round shape (4.5 cm). CT scan-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy was then carried out on the left adrenal mass. It revealed the presence of NHL type B with large cells and modest T-lymphocyte reactive component. The patient was treated with three cycles of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisolone. At the end of the third cycle, there was a transient clinical improvement and the hitching disappeared, but the patient worsened rapidly and she died few weeks later."

We present a case of non-secretory primary plasma cell leukemia (Bence-Jones kappa type), which was treated successfully by VEP-IFN-alpha therapy. A 82-year old man was admitted to Kanazawa Medical University in May 1991, because of emaciation and dehydration. Clinical findings showed decreased level of gamma-globulin (IgG, IgA and IgM were all decreased markedly), hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction and increased serum beta-2 microglobulin. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 30,100/microliters with 64% plasma cells, and 80.4% plasma cells were also observed in the bone marrow. Only light chain-kappa was detected in plasma cells by an immunohistochemical staining method, but immunoelectrophoresis showed no M-bow either in serum or urine. Electron microscopy revealed typical plasma cells with prominently developed rough endoplasmic reticulum. From these results, the diagnosis of non-secretory primary plasma cell leukemia was established. He was treated with VEP-IFN-alpha regimen, and plasma cells decreased markedly in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. Serum immunoglobulin recovered to within the normal range. After 6 courses of VEP-IFN-alpha, complete remission was achieved and the remission was maintained until he died of an unrelated event, bronchial obstruction due to misswallowing, in April 1992."

CD009647,0,12937311,0,Icodextrin improves the fluid status of peritoneal dialysis patients: results of a double-blind randomized controlled trial.,"Worsening fluid balance results in reduced technique and patient survival in peritoneal dialysis. Under these conditions, the glucose polymer icodextrin is known to enhance ultrafiltration in the long dwell. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was undertaken to compare icodextrin versus 2.27% glucose to establish whether icodextrin improves fluid status. Fifty patients with urine output <750 ml/d, high solute transport, and either treated hypertension or untreated BP >140/90 mmHg, or a requirement for the equivalent of all 2.27% glucose exchanges, were randomized 1:1 and evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 mo. Members of the icodextrin group lost weight, whereas the control group gained weight. Similar differences in total body water were observed, largely explained by reduced extracellular fluid volume in those receiving icodextrin, who also achieved better ultrafiltration and total sodium losses at 3 mo (P < 0.05) and had better maintenance of urine volume at 6 mo (P = 0.039). In patients fulfilling the study's inclusion criteria, the use of icodextrin, when compared with 2.27% glucose, in the long exchange improves fluid removal and status in peritoneal dialysis. This effect is apparent within 1 mo of commencement and was sustained for 6 mo without harmful effects on residual renal function."
CD009647,0,12937312,0,Serial determinations of absolute plasma volume with indocyanine green during hemodialysis.,"Hemodynamic stability during hemodialysis depends largely on plasma volume (PV) preservation during ultrafiltration (UF). Current estimates of blood volume (BV) are indirect or involve the use of radioactive tracers, which does not allow repeated measurements during hemodialysis. Indocyanine green was used to measure PV during hemodialysis. After an initial pilot phase (phase I), PV values were determined before dialysis, repeatedly during isovolemic hemodialysis (phase II), and during stepwise UF (phase III). Absolute BV values were calculated from PV and hematocrit values. Patients were monitored for extracellular fluid volume (bioimpedance monitoring) and relative BV changes (ultrasonic monitoring). Phase I demonstrated dye stability in plasma, peak absorbance at 805 nm, and a short half-life (4.53 +/- 1.5 min). Ten milligrams of dye (2.5 mg/ml) were injected for each PV measurement. Eight plasma samples were obtained beginning 3 min after injection, at 1-min intervals, for assessment of decay characteristics. The isovolemic hemodialysis PV measurements demonstrated excellent reproducibility (r(2) = 0.98; method SD, 356 ml; mean coefficient of variation, 4.07%) and a difference of only 149 +/- 341 ml (mean +/- SD), compared with predialysis PV values (Bland-Altman method). PV values at the beginning of dialysis were significantly correlated with body surface area (r(2) = 0.82, P < 0.001) and extracellular fluid estimates (r(2) = 0.73, P < 0.001). BV prediction formulae significantly underestimated absolute BV at the start of dialysis (P < 0.0001). The findings demonstrate that this method can be used for repeated PV determinations during hemodialysis, with excellent reproducibility. It is a potential tool for further research on hemodynamic stability during UF."

Five different non-invasive methods were used. Values were followed for 360 min after application of the emulsion, with the contralateral forearm as untreated control. The evaporation of emulsion water from the skin surface immediately rose to high values, but within 15 min returned to the original level. A parallel initial increase in conductance was observed; however, this was followed by a slightly increased level throughout the 360 min study. Electrical capacitance was also slightly increased throughout the study. Skin surface lipids, dominated by emulsion lipids, were increased, with high values for at least 120 min, followed by a gradual decline toward normal. Single application of emulsion is characterized by an initial evaporation phase, with evaporation of emulsion water, which lasts less than 15 min, followed by a lipidization phase, which lasts at least 360 min, dominated by the oil-constituent of the emulsion undergoing epidermal absorption. During the lipidization phase, epidermal hydration parameters are slightly but consistently improved."

Thirteen patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy, were asked to drink three liters of Isocolan (Bracco s.p.a.) at a rate of 500 ml/30 minutes, 8 hours before endoscopic examination. Plasma electrolytes (Na, K, C1), BUN, creatinine, glycemia, hematocrit, urine specific weight, arterial pressure, pulse rate, ECG and body weight were obtained before and after PEG-ELS supply. Colonic cleansing was judged by the same endoscopist as excellent, good or poor. Data, expressed as mean (SE), were analyzed by a two-tailed ranked test. PEG-ELS supply did not alter fluid and electrolyte balance, since no significant differences were found for all laboratory parameters studied. Out of the clinical features, diastolic arterial pressure significantly (p = 0.05) raised from 72.3 (3.0) to 78.8 (2.8) mmHg and body weight significantly (p = 0.007) increased from 70.7 (3.4) to 71.2 (3.4) kg. Colon cleansing resulted excellent in 8 patients and good in 5.

Energy requirements should be estimated from measurements of energy expenditure. For this purpose twenty-one free-living individuals (eight males, thirteen females) aged 91-96 years living in Göteborg, Sweden were studied. Total body water (TBW) measured by the doubly-labelled-water (DLW) technique was 29.5 (sd 5.4) kg in females and 35.6 (sd 4.3) kg in males. TBW measured using bioelectric impedance (BIA) was 31.6 (sd 6.4) kg in females and 42.0 (sd 7.4) kg in males. The mean difference between TBW measured by BIA and that measured by DLW was 3.54 (sd 3.6) kg (P = 0.0002). Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured using a ventilated-hood system and averaged 5.36 (sd 0.71) MJ/d in females (n 12) and 6.09 (sd 0.91) MJ/d in males (n 8). Difference between measured RMR and predicted BMR (n 20) was 0.015 (sd 0.86) MJ/d (NS).

Eleven patients (9 males and 2 females, 64 +/- 3.5 yr) with SIADH were included in the present protocol, which was comprised of 3 successive days. Day 1 was a control day, and on days 2 and 3 OPC-31260 was administered intravenously. Five blood and urine collections were made at 1-2 h intervals during the 6 h observation period each day. A single administration of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg OPC-31260 increased the 4 h cumulative urine volume and decreased urinary osmolality to below 225 mOsm/kg H2O. Such a diuretic effect was independent of an increase in urinary solute excretions. This aquaresis by 0.5 mg/kg OPC-31260 caused a significant increase in serum sodium level by approximately 3 mEq/L. The antagonistic effect of OPC-31260 lasted for 4 h when it was given intravenously. These results indicate that OPC-31260 is an effective therapeutic agent for hyponatremia in patients with SIADH."
CD009647,0,7043016,0,Hemodynamic and natriuretic responses to intravenous infusion of dopamine in patients with essential hypertension.,"In order to clarify the role of dopamine on the pathophysiology of essential hypertension, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), urine volume (UV), urinary sodium excretion (UNaV), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr), fractional excretions of sodium (FENa), inorganic phosphorus (FEP) and potassium (FEK), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma noradrenaline concentration (PNA) were measured before and after intravenous infusion of dopamine (3 micrograms/kg/min, 60 min) in normotensive (NT) and essential hypertensive subjects (EHT). Following dopamine infusion, a significant decrease of MAP and an increase of HR were observed in EHT but not in NT. UV, UNaV, Ccr, FENa, FEP and FEK increased significantly in both NT and EHT, and changes in these except for Ccr were significantly greater in EHT than in NT. In EHT, following dopamine infusion, PNA was clearly elevated, but no remarkable change was found in PRA and PAC. A significantly positive correlation was found between delta UNaV and delta FENa or delta FEP, and between delta FENa and delta FEP, while no significant relation was observed between delta UNaV and delta Ccr, delta MAP or MAP before dopamine infusion. A significant inverse correlation between supine PRA before dopamine infusion and delta FENa or delta FEP and a positive correlation between age and delta FENa or delta FEP were also observed in these patients. The changes in UNaV positively correlated with delta FENa and delta FEP in both low renin (group L) and normal renin EHT (group N) and with delta Ccr i group N but not in group L. The mean values of delta FENa, delta FEP and delta FEK were significantly higher in group L as compared with those in age-matched group N. These results suggest that, since the enhanced response to infused dopamine may reflect reduced dopaminergic activity, attenuation of renal dopaminergic activity might exist and be involved through a distribution of water-sodium metabolism, at least in part, in the pathophysiological mechanism in EHT, particularly in group L."
CD009647,0,3800181,0,Hyponatremia responsive to fludrocortisone acetate in elderly patients after head injury.,"Severe hyponatremia developed within 2 weeks of head injuries in three elderly patients. Before the head injuries occurred, normal serum levels of sodium had been found in two of the three patients. Hyponatremia (105 to 117 meq/L) was associated with persistently increased urinary excretion of sodium. The patients appeared dehydrated and had lost weight. The mean plasma level of antidiuretic hormone was 5.0 +/- 1.6 (SD) pg/mL, which was relatively high despite decreased osmolality. Plasma renin activity was suppressed to 0.25 +/- 0.13 ng/mL X h, and plasma aldosterone levels measured low-normal or normal. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels remained unchanged after the patients were given furosemide and placed in an upright position. The hyponatremia promptly resolved after the administration of fludrocortisone acetate, 0.1 to 0.4 mg/d. These observations indicate that severe hyponatremia occurs in elderly persons rapidly after head injuries, that it responds well to mineralocorticoid hormone therapy, and that both central nervous system and renal components may be involved in the mechanisms of action of the disorder."

The impedance index was determined at a low frequency (5 kHz) and correlated closely with ECW, using sodium bromide dilution as standard comparison. The levels of serum albumin, prealbumin, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), transferrin, and human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) were measured by routine methods in our hospital. The ECW/TBW ratio was significantly associated with the levels of hANP (p < 0.05). However, no associations between the levels of serum albumin, TC, TG, or transferrin and the ECW/TBW were observed. It appears that the body composition analyzer, InBody 2.0, may be useful for estimating the dry weight in chronic HD patients."
CD009647,0,16501488,0,Detection limit of methods to assess fluid status changes in dialysis patients.,"Technical systems for an accurate and practicable fluid management of dialysis patients are urgently needed, since current clinical methods are partially subjective, imprecise, and time consuming. Such new systems should not only allow the determination of the target normohydration weight, but also must be able to detect clinically relevant changes in fluid volume ( approximately 1 l). This study focuses on the systematic analysis of the detection limit of several candidate methods for fluid management. In a cohort of 16 new dialysis patients, several candidate methods were applied in parallel during each treatment of the initial weight reduction phase: the measurement of vena cava diameter (VCD), vena cava collapsibility index (CI), the blood volume drop during an ultrafiltration (UF) bolus (Deltarelative blood volume (RBV)-), the rebound after the UF bolus (DeltaRBV+), and the extracellular fluid volume determined with whole body bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS). A clinical reference method was used to manage the fluid status of patients. All methods showed significant correlations with predialysis weight. The detection limits W(lim) of candidate methods for changes in fluid status were assessed as W(lim)=0.87 kg+/-0.64 kg (BIS), 1.74 kg+/-1.56 kg (VCD), 2.3 kg+/-1.0 kg (DeltaRBV-), 7.4 kg+/-8.5 kg (CI), 40 kg+/-108 kg (DeltaRBV+). Only BIS shows a satisfactorily low detection limit W(lim), whereas W(lim) was rated as critical for the VCD and DeltaRBV- methods, and as unacceptable for the CI and DeltaRBV+ methods. Bioimpedance spectroscopy appears to be the most promising method for a practical fluid management system in dialysis."

HHS is a metabolic emergency and is associated with a high mortality rate. It is characterized by extreme dehydration and neurologic symptoms, which are related directly to the degree of hyperosmolality. We describe a 65-year-old patient who was admitted because of impaired consciousness caused by HHS. The relevant clinical and laboratory findings are discussed, and a brief overview of the pathophysiology and therapeutic management is provided."
CD009647,0,18338283,0,"Interaction of hydration, aging, and carbon content of soil on the evaporation and skin bioavailability of munition contaminants.","Water plays a key role in enhancing the permeability of human skin to many substances. To further understand its ability to potentially increase the bioavailability of soil contaminants, artificial sweat was applied to excised pig skin prior to dosing with munition-contaminated soils. Skin was mounted in chambers to allow simultaneous measurement of evaporation and penetration and to control air flow, which changed the dwell time of skin surface water within a l-h period post application of test materials. Additional variables included type of compound, aging of spiked soil samples, and carbon content of soil. To this end, the evaporation and skin penetration of C-14 labeled hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), 2,6-dinitrotoluene (26DNT), and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) were determined from two soil types, Yolo, having 1.2% carbon, and Tinker, having 9.5% carbon. RDX soil samples aged 27 mo and 62 mo were compared to freshly spiked soils samples. Similarly, 26DNT samples aged 35-36 mo and TNT samples aged 18 mo were compared to freshly spiked samples. Approximately 10 microg/cm(2) of radiolabeled compound was applied in 10 mg/cm(2) of soil. Radiolabel recovered from the dermis and tissue culture media (receptor fluid) was summed to determine percent absorption from the soils. Radiolabel recovered from vapor traps determined evaporation. Mean skin absorption of all compounds was higher for low-carbon soil, regardless of soil age and skin surface water as affected by air flow conditions. For 26DNT, a simultaneous increase in evaporation and penetration with conditions that favored enhanced soil hydration of freshly prepared samples was consistent with a mechanism that involved water displacement of 26DNT from its binding sites. A mean penetration of 17.5 +/- 3.6% was observed for 26DNT in low-carbon soil, which approached the value previously reported for acetone vehicle (24 +/- 6%). 26DNT penetration was reduced to 0.35% under dryer conditions and to 0.08% when no sweat was applied. When soil hydration conditions were not varied from cell to cell, air flow that favored a longer water dwell time increased penetration, but not evaporation, consistent with a mechanism of enhanced skin permeability from a higher hydration state of the stratum corneum. Profiles of 26DNT penetration versus air flow conditions were exponential for freshly prepared soil samples, suggesting strong and weak binding sites; corresponding profiles of 26DNT penetration from aged samples were linear, suggesting a conversion of weak to strong binding sites. Absorption and evaporation was less than 5% for TNT and less than 1% for RDX, regardless of soil type and age. Fresh preparations of RDX in Tinker soil and aged samples of TNT in Yolo soil showed a significant decrease in skin absorption with loss of surface moisture. The penetration rate of radiolabel into the receptor fluid was highest during the 1-2 h interval after dosing with 26DNT or TNT. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of 26DNT in receptor fluid at maximum flux indicated no metabolism or breakdown. For TNT, however, extensive conversion to monoamino derivatives and other metabolites was observed. Relatively little radioactivity was found in the dermis after 26DNT and TNT applications, and dermal extracts were therefore not analyzed by HPLC. RDX was not sufficiently absorbed from soils to allow HPLC analysis. This study has practical significance, as the use of water for dust control at remediation sites may have the unintended effect of increasing volatilization and subsequent absorption of soil contaminants. Soil in contact with sweaty skin may give the same result. Skin absorption of 26DNT from soil was over 50-fold higher than the value for dryer skin and over 200-fold higher than the value obtained when there was no sweat application. While the hydration effect was less dramatic for RDX and TNT, soil contaminants more closely matching the physical properties of 26DNT may be similarly affected by hydration."

CD009647,0,2467493,0,Stratum corneum hydration in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.,"Dry-looking skin of unknown etiology develops in a majority of patients with chronic renal failure. The hydration of the stratum corneum influences the appearance of the skin and lack of water is considered to induce roughness, e.g. in atopic dermatitis. The aim of the present study was to compare the water content in uremic and healthy skin and to evaluate the possible relationship between skin hydration and pruritus in uremic patients. Thirty-one patients, 19 with pruritus, undergoing chronic hemodialysis participated. Twelve healthy age-matched subjects served as controls. The skin of the uremic patients appeared generally xerotic, whereas the controls had normal-looking skin. The water content of the stratum corneum was recorded with the Corneometer, a capacitance-measuring device, on three different sites: the neck, the chest and the lower leg. There was a significant difference in water content between locations in all groups, the water content being highest in the neck and lowest in the leg (p less than 0.01). There was a tendency that patients with pruritus had a lower water content than patients without pruritus, but there was no significant difference between uremic patients and controls. Hence, insufficient hydration does not seem to explain the difference in skin texture between uremic patients and healthy subjects."

We describe the outcome of its use in RA. Of 21 patients entered into the study, 10 successfully completed 6 months of therapy; five developed adverse effects, four withdrew for reasons unrelated to drug treatment and two stopped because of inefficacy. No serious adverse effects were reported. A statistically significant improvement in most clinical assessments was observed from weeks 8-12 onwards. Significant improvement in plasma viscosity was observed and there was a trend towards improvement in serum CRP, histidine and IgM concentrations. There was a good correlation between mean serial changes in clinical and biochemical assessments indicating that the drug may exhibit the properties of a second-line agent. Median steady-state serum concentrations of methylsulphasalazine and methylsulphapyridine were 26.6 micrograms/ml and 2.85 micrograms/ml respectively."

The other 5 patients were treated with intravenous dobutamine for 72 h; 2 responded (average weight loss 4.4 kg), and 2 responded to subsequent reintroduction of metolazone. 4 of these 5 patients died, 2 in hospital of acute myocardial infarction. Overall, 15 patients with very severe refractory cardiac failure improved sufficiently to be discharged from hospital. Treatment was associated with mild transient hypokalaemia in 7 patients, and hyponatraemia and renal impairment in 1, for whom metolazone dosage had to be reduced. Failure to respond to the introduction of metolazone may indicate an especially poor prognosis."

CD009647,0,2605866,0,Vasopressin secretion in diabetic subjects with and without autonomic neuropathy: responses to osmotic and postural stimulation.,"1. The release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) after an osmotic stimulus and head-up tilt was assessed in diabetic subjects with and without autonomic neuropathy. 2. Six diabetic subjects with (DAN +ve) and five without (DAN -ve) evidence of autonomic neuropathy and five normal subjects were infused with 5% (w/v) NaCl at a rate of 0.05 ml min-1 kg-1 body weight for 120 min. Blood pressure, heart rate and plasma AVP were measured over this period. 3. Seven DAN +ve, six DAN -ve and six normal subjects were tilted head-up to 45 degrees for 120 min. Blood pressure, heart rate and plasma AVP were measured during the study. 4. Infusion of 5% (w/v) NaCl produced appropriate rises in plasma osmolality and plasma AVP levels which did not differ between the three groups, confirming the normal osmotic release of AVP in the diabetic subjects. 5. During head-up tilt, there were no differences in AVP responses between the three groups, despite a major hypotensive stimulus in the DAN +ve group. 6. We conclude that osmotic release of AVP is normal in diabetes, but that cardiovascular release of AVP is impaired in diabetic subjects with cardiovascular reflex evidence of autonomic neuropathy, reflecting an afferent defect."
CD009647,0,8225650,0,Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration in critically ill patients with multiple organ failure.,"18 critically ill patients, with multiple organ failure (MOF) (from shock either septic, n = 15, or cardiogenic, n = 3), oliguria and increase in BUN and creatinine were treated with pump driven, high flux continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Replacement fluids were administered in predilution mode. All patients were under respiratory support and vasoactive drugs, and received early nutritional support (N input: 0.2-0.3 g/kg/day). Mean duration of treatment was 9.2 days and mean ultrafiltrate production was 21.4 l/day; treatment resulted in a significant reduction of both urea nitrogen and creatinine blood levels (-20 and -40% of initial values respectively) in spite of a very severe catabolism. The total amount of urea nitrogen removed through CVVH ranged from 15 to 73 g/day (mean 33.5), the median value of urea nitrogen clearance was 12.8 ml/min with a median ultrafiltration coefficient of 0.8. The mean duration of hemofilters was 69 hours (38-108); the efficacy of filters remained stable throughout the entire lifespan and changes were made in case of sudden decrease of ultrafiltration (< ml/min). No major complication was observed in over than 4000 hours of treatment. Pump driven, high flux CVVH proved effective in the control of water electrolyte balance and metabolic homeostasis in a group of critically ill, hemodynamically unstable, catabolic patients with MOF and acute renal failure. In no case we had to add intermittent hemodialysis or to use hemodiafiltration. The constant extracorporeal blood flow and the stable efficacy of hemofilters allowed an easy control of the overall effectiveness of this technique."

CD009647,0,1563117,0,The recovery of the fluid balance after hemodialysis and hemofiltration.,"Dialysis dysequilibrium syndrome is a frequent complication of renal replacement therapy and seems to be related to changes in fluid balance. From previous studies it is known that these changes are less pronounced during hemofiltration (HF), leading to a lower incidence of complaints compared to hemodialysis (HD). To assess the severity and duration of the dysequilibrium syndrome, intracellular (ICV) and extracellular fluid volumes (ECV) were measured during and after HD and HF by means of a non-invasive conductivity method. Blood volume changes were calculated from pre- and post-treatment erythrocyte counts. Seven HD and eight HF patients were studied. Ultrafiltration volume did not differ between both groups. Blood volume decrease was less during HF due to a significant decrease in ICV, the latter being in contrast to an ICV increment during HD. The significant decrease in ICV led to a less severe decrease in ECV (90 versus 85%). Overall, this resulted in a better vascular refill during HF. At the end of treatment ICV and ECV were not in equilibrium yet. During the recovery period ICV increased roughly 3% in the HF group. In the HD group some patients showed an increase while others showed a decrease in ICV. Overall, no change in ICV was noticed. During recovery ECV decreased further in both groups. The measured recovery period was significantly shorter after HF (245 +/- 68 min) than after HD (299 +/- 37), supporting the hypothesis that HF is a more physiological way of treatment compared to HD."

Both of the enzymes were detectable in blister fluid and serum, but their expression varied. The MMP-2 levels in serum were only about half of the levels in blister fluid, while the level of MMP-9 was about the same in both serum and blister fluid. The overall level of MMP-2 in serum was much lower than the level of MMP-9 which was possibly derived from inflammatory cells. In subjects aged from 20 to 86 years, no marked changes were seen in the serum or blister fluid gelatinases. Interestingly, body site affected the level of MMP-9. The lowest level was recorded in fluid from blisters on the lower leg, in which the level was only about 19% of the level in fluid from blisters on the abdomen. The levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were not decreased by pharmacological doses of systemic prednisone or isotretinoin, which indicates that systemic glucocorticoid or retinoid treatment does not affect the basal levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9."

Before and immediately after conventional abdominal angiography, serum and urinary BUN, creatinine, sodium, osmolality and urinary volume were examined. Urinary minute volume increased remarkably immediately after angiography in all the contrast media groups. In Iohexol 350 and Iomeprol 400, creatinine clearance (Ccr) increased immediately after angiography, while no Ccr increase was observed in Ioxaglate 320. FENa increased immediately after angiography in all the contrast media groups. There were no statistical differences in the changes of FENa among Ioxaglate 320, Iohexol 350 and Iomeprol 400. There was no significant change in CH2O. It becomes evident that the osmotic diuresis and its effect on the proximal tubular function are induced by administrated low osmolar contrast media and that these changes are reversible."

Gated blood pool scans showed right ventricular abnormalities in 21 out of 26 patients who were submitted to this investigation (right ventricular asynergy: 16 cases; right ventricular dilatation: eight cases; decreased right ventricular ejection fraction: 16 cases). Complications were common in the acute stage. Shock was noted in 19 cases (eight related to bradycardia, three related to relative hypovolaemia and eight instances of true cardiogenic shock). Atrial fibrillation (seven patients), ventricular fibrillation (eight patients) and severe atrioventricular conduction disorders (13 patients) were also frequent. In spite of this, the in-hospital mortality was low: three deaths occurred (6.1%), one from heart failure, two others from posterior septal rupture. All patients were followed up for one year or more. Six additional deaths were noted (three from left cardiac failure, two from recurrent anterior wall infarction and one from massive pulmonary embolism). Clinical assessment, haemodynamic measurements and gated blood pool scans showed significant improvement of right ventricular function with return to normal in those cases with small right ventricular infarcts as judged from technetium-99 m pyrophosphate scintigraphy. In spite of the complications seen in the initial period, patients with a right ventricular infarction have a good overall prognosis and the long-term outcome, primarily determined by the left-sided lesions, is often favourable."
CD009647,0,18694703,0,Dementia and dysphagia.,"In 2004, more than 12% of the population in the United States was aged 65 years or older. This percentage is expected to increase to 20% of the population by 2030. The prevalence of swallowing disorders, or dysphagia, in older individuals ranges from 7% to 22% and dramatically increases to 40% to 50% in older individuals who reside in long-term care facilities. For older individuals, those with neurologic disease, or those with dementia, the consequence of dysphagia may be dehydration, malnutrition, weight loss, and aspiration pneumonia. Dysphagia can be a result of behavioral, sensory, or motor problems (or a combination of these) and is common in individuals with neurologic disease and dementia. Although there are few studies of the incidence and prevalence of dysphagia in individuals with dementia, it is estimated that 45% of institutionalized dementia patients have dysphagia. The high prevalence of dysphagia in individuals with dementia likely is the result of age-related changes in sensory and motor function in addition to those produced by neuropathology. The following article describes evidence based practices in caring for those individuals with dementia and dysphagia with guidelines for evaluation and management."
CD009647,0,11777321,0,Warning of high-flux hemodialysis.,"In order to estimate the influence of flux on plasma refilling during hemodialysis (HD), prospective crossover studies were performed in 10 HD patients with low-flux and high-flux dialyzers. Hematocrit was continuously monitored to assess changes in blood volume. In addition, plasma osmolarity and total protein concentration were measured. Intradialytic reductions in body weight (-5 +/- 1 vs -5 +/- 1%) and plasma osmolarity (-5 +/- 1 vs -5 +/- 1%) were similar in both conditions. Although mean blood pressure remained unchanged in either state, the decrease in blood volume was larger in high-flux HD (-13 +/- 2 vs -10 +/- 2%, p<0.05). In spite of greater contraction in blood volume during high-flux HD, total proteins were increased equally between low-flux and high-flux HD (11 +/- 4 vs 11 +/- 4%). Our data that although high-flux HD failed to induce significant drops in blood pressure, it elicited greater magnitude of decreases in blood volume, implicate the judicious application of high-flux HD."

CD009647,0,8309120,0,[The effect of desmopressin (DDAVP) in patients complaining of nocturia].,"The mechanism of increased nocturnal urine production in adult patients complaining of nocturia has seldom been reported. The objective of this clinical study is to investigate the circadian rhythm of both urine production and plasma arginine-vasopressin (AVP) level, and the efficacy of intranasal instillation of 1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin (DDAVP) in adult patients complaining of nocturia. Eight patients (seven men, one woman) who ranged in age from 44 to 77 years (mean 64.1 years) were examined. Three of them suffered from Shy-Drager syndrome, and no patient had shown any improvement of symptoms in spite of administration of anti-cholinergic agents and restriction of water intake. Nocturnal urine volume was more than bladder capacity in all patients, and no patient showed normal elevation of nocturnal plasma AVP level. Intranasal administration of DDAVP of 5 or 10 micrograms revealed marked decrease in nocturia, and nocturnal urine volume (p < 0.01). There were mild side effects (headache, nasal obstruction, and hyponatremia) not requiring any treatment. In conclusion, DDAVP is a safe and effective treatment for adult patients complaining of nocturia due to hyperproduction of nocturnal urine and inappropriate nocturnal secretion of AVP."
CD009647,0,2720865,0,Consequences of fluid absorption during transurethral resection of the prostate using distilled water or glycine 1.5 per cent.,"This prospective and randomized study compared the consequences of two irrigating fluids, distilled water and glycine for transurethral prostatectomy. Forty-nine consecutive unselected patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate with spinal anaesthesia were investigated. The irrigating fluid was either distilled water (group A, 24 patients) or glycine 1.5 per cent (group B, 25 patients). The absorption of irrigating fluid was measured, all surgical events and any clinical signs of TURP syndrome during and after surgery were recorded. Early signs of TURP syndrome were observed in one patient in group A and in four in group B without further consequence. From all the biological variables, only plasma protein concentration, haematocrit, free plasma haemoglobin and free bilirubin concentrations were found to have changed. Plasma protein concentration and haematocrit decreased significantly during and after surgery in the two groups. Free plasma haemoglobin increased significantly with time: a significantly higher concentration was observed in group A than group B. Free bilirubin concentration increased with time in the two groups and was statistically greater in group A. With the two irrigating fluids, we observed a significant amount of haemolysis and haemodilution without clinical consequences. A low irrigating fluid pressure, a short resection time, and the use of spinal anaesthesia seems to us to be essential. Close observation of patients following transurethral prostatectomy is needed but the choice of the irrigating fluid does not seem to be important."
CD009647,0,10598561,0,Preliminary results of a phase I study with MTA (LY231514) in combination with cisplatin in patients with solid tumors.,"MTA (multitargeted antifolate, LY231514) is a novel antimetabolite resulting from structure/activity studies of the lometrexol-type antifolates. It has been shown to inhibit various enzymes of folate pathways and has broad antitumor activity in a variety of in vitro and in vivo tumor models. Clinical phase 1 studies have been performed using different administration schedules, and subsequently the every-21-days schedule has been selected for further development. We report the preliminary findings from a combination phase I study of MTA and cisplatin administered every 21 days. In the first cohort (34 patients), both agents were administered on day 1 with a starting dose of 300 mg/m2 MTA and 60 mg/m2 cisplatin. In a second cohort (10 patients), MTA (500 or 600 mg/m2) was administered on day 1 followed by cisplatin (75 mg/m2) on day 2. The maximum tolerated doses were reached at 600 mg/m2 MTA/100 mg/m2 cisplatin (cohort 1) and 600 mg/m2 MTA/75 mg/m2 cisplatin (cohort 2). In cohort 1, dose-limiting toxicities consisted of reversible myelosuppression with leukopenia and neutropenia. In addition, delayed fatigue also was of clinical significance. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that hydration administered before the administration of cisplatin did not influence the major pharmacokinetic parameters of MTA. Eleven objective remissions were observed, including one complete response in a patient with relapsed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and partial responses in four of seven patients with mesothelioma In contrast, the dose-limiting toxicities in patient cohort 2 consisted of neutropenic sepsis, diarrhea, and skin toxicity with two possibly treatment-related deaths on study. No objective remissions are presently observed in cohort 2. We conclude that the combination of MTA and cisplatin is feasible and clinically active when both agents are administered on day 1 and that it should be pursued for further clinical development."

The chest x-ray film taken immediately after the catheterization showed the proper placement of the catheter, but it revealed a significant right hemidiaphragmatic elevation indicating phrenic nerve palsy. A chest computed tomography scan and bronchoscopy were normal. As the patient did not complain of dyspnoea and vital signs were normal, tumour resection was performed. The operative and postoperative course was uneventful. The chest x-ray film after the surgery still showed the elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. It resolved completely within 3 days of withdrawing the central venous catheter by 3 cm on the fourth postoperative day. We concluded the likely cause of the phrenic nerve palsy was that the catheter tip impinged upon the thin venous wall and compressed the phrenic nerve running alongside the superior vena cava."

CD009647,0,10599213,0,[A case of pulmonary tuberculosis with acute renal failure caused by readministration of rifampicin].,"We report a case of pulmonary tuberculosis with acute renal failure caused by readministration of Rifampicin (RFP). A 73 year-old man was admitted to a certain hospital complaining with dyspnea on exertion. As his sputum smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli, he was transferred to our hospital for the isolation and treatment. He was diagnosed as lung tuberculosis and was administrated RFP, Isoniazid (INH) and Ethambutol (EB). On the 20th day after the initiation of treatment, the administration of drugs were suspended, because of liver dysfunction. After recovery of liver dysfunction, we have readministered antituberculous drugs, starting with EB, then INH, and finally RFP. On the 22nd day after the readministration of RFP, acute renal failure was observed. All medications were suspended and we started treatment with hydration and furosemide. His renal function recovered after 7 weeks. Histopathological examination of the kidney revealed interstitial infiltration and tubular nephritis. According to the histopathological examination and the clinical course, we concluded acute renal failure was induced by the readministration of RFP. This case suggests that we have to pay attention to renal side effect of RFP in the course of readministration."
CD009647,0,1190870,0,Influence of the postoperative state on the intracellular free amino acids in human muscle tissue.,"Five patients were studied before and two to three days after major, uncomplicated abdominal operation. Muscle tissue was obtained by needle biopsy from m. quadriceps femoris after eight hours overnight fast. Plasma free amino acids were analyzed in simultaneously obtained samples. In the homogenized muscle samples the intracellular concentration of each amino acid (IC) was calculated by subtracting the free extracellular part from the total amount, assuming the plasma concentration to be equal to the concentration in the interstitial fluid. Their relationships have also been calculated (IC/EC gradient). The extra- and intracellular water distribution was estimated using a modified chloride method. In similarity to the findings in normal subjects the majority of the amino acids showed much higher concentration in intracellular water than in plasma. Preoperatively all amino acids examined in muscle biopsies were formed within normal limits. Postoperatively the total amount of free amino acids in plasma and muscle was decreased, and the amino acid profiles differed from those observed in normal subjects. In plasma, as compared with normal controls, the most significant changes were an increase in phenylalanine and tyrosine and a decrease in serine, proline, histidine and isoleucine. In muscle the greatest decrease occurred in the concentrations of glutamine, arginine and lysine followed by proline and glutamic acid. The increase in taurine, valine and phenylalanine were all highly significant and in serin, glycine, alanine and leucine significant, whereas tyrosine showed only a moderate rise. Compared with normal values there were marked increases in the gradient between intracellular and plasma concentrations which were highly significant for glycine and valine and significant for serine, alanine, isoleucine and leucine. The shift in the methionine gradient was somewhat less. We confirm that alterations in the muscle free amino acid pool are not reflected in the values found in plasma. Further work is required to explore the clinical significance of the observed variations in individual amino acids."

Extent of suspected abuse was 44.6%. Female sex, > or = 75 years, widowhood, living alone or with children, accommodation in house of relatives and income < or = 300 euros/month were the associated sociodemographic variables. The risk factors associated are recent worsening of health, living with a mentally ill person, excessive consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs, arguing frequently with relatives or the dependence on someone to carry out a daily activity. The signs in the physical examination associated are dehydration/malnutrition, pressure ulcers and poor body and/or mouth hygiene.

Serum T, free T, and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone were measured during this period. T pharmacokinetics were determined from the data obtained during a 24-h sampling at wk 12. Physiological mean serum T concentrations were steady and consistently maintained. The mean percentage of time over a 24-h period that total serum T concentrations were above the lower limit of adult male range was 80.1%. During treatment, mean serum 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, free T, and estradiol concentrations paralleled serum T. T pharmacokinetics were not significantly affected by body mass index, age, food or beverage, gum abnormalities, or medications known to cause dry mouth. Gum-related adverse events occurred in 16.3% of subjects. Except for three subjects, the gum adverse effects occurred early during treatment, did not cause interruption of treatment, and resolved rapidly and completely.

CD009647,0,17977402,0,[Unilateral pulmonary oedema after lung re-expansion in pneumothorax].,"Unilateral pulmonary Oedema after re-expansion during intercostal drainage of pneumothorax is a serious complication. The article deals with a 72-year-old woman who was admitted to Intensive Ward in haemorrhagic shock for haematemesis and melena. The first examinations established pronounced hypovolaemia, secondary anaemia, extra-renal azotaemia, hypoproteinaemia and respiratory insufficiency. During puncture of the right subclavical vein for insertion of a catheter iatrogen pneumothorax was performed. After thoracic drainage with negative pressure the patients' condition aggravated. Radiographical examination of the lungs revealed a total re-expansion of the right lung with changes characteristic of unilateral pulmonary oedema. Thanks to an appropriate treatment the patient recovered. Unilateral pulmonary oedema was provoked by rapid re-expansion of the right lung due to increase of negative pressure in the pulmonary interstitum and increase of permeability of the capillary and alveolar barriers. The attentive follow-up of clinical signs, auscultation of the lungs, monitoring of vital parameters of the patient, gas analyses, RTG control examinations are of great importance in the detection of pulmonary oedema. Thus, an appropriate treatment can prevent undesirable consequences."

CD009647,0,9294826,0,Urinary excretion of aquaporin-2 water channel protein in human and rat.,"Previous studies by the authors demonstrated that the response of urinary aquaporin-2 (AQP2) excretion to dDAVP (deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) infusion is an index of vasopressin action on the kidney (N Engl J Med 332: 1540-1545, 1995). In the study presented here, the characteristics of urinary excretion of AQP2 were examined further. An RIA suitable for AQP2 in the urine was established. Relatively high concentrations of detergent and bovine serum albumin in the RIA buffer allowed analysis of urine samples with a wide range of concentrations and increased the sensitivity of the assay. AQP2 in the urine existed as a high molecular weight form of approximately 190 kD by HPLC analysis. The mean urinary AQP2 concentration corrected for creatinine in spot urine samples of healthy subjects who voided in the morning was 1081 +/- 699 fmol/mg creatinine (mean +/- SD, n = 208). The amount of daily excretion of AQP2 in the urine was the same in men and women. Urinary AQP2 content was not affected by age of the subjects and showed a positive correlation with urine osmolality. Finally, the fraction of AQP2 excreted in the urine compared with whole kidney content was determined in the rat. Approximately 3% of AQP2 in the kidney was excreted daily, and this fraction did not change when rats were dehydrated for 3 d. These data demonstrate the necessity of establishing well-designed protocols to use urinary AQP2 as a marker of AVP action."
CD009647,0,8399652,0,Longitudinal assessment of body composition in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients using bioelectric impedance and anthropometric measurements.,"We assessed the utility of bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) and anthropometry for longitudinal evaluation of body composition in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Eleven subjects were studied at the beginning of CAPD and again at regular intervals during the first 6 months of treatment. The significant weight gain that occurs in our patients is mainly due to a rise in total body water (TBW), as measured by BIA, during the first weeks of CAPD, and later on due to a body fat increase. Anthropometry seems more reliable than BIA in the evaluation of body mass, because the latter is derived from TBW in BIA. Therefore, any change in TBW that occurs in a CAPD patient necessarily causes a similar change in the fat-free mass. In our experience, only the combined use of both anthropometry and BIA allows a proper assessment of body composition in patients on CAPD."
CD009647,0,578637,0,"Relative contents of sodium, potassium, water and dry matter in human senile cataractous lenses in relation to anterior capsular/subcapsular opacity.","In 49 human senile cataractous lenses the sodium and potassium concentrations of the lens water as well as the water and dry weight percentages were examined. It was found justifiable to classify the lenses into three categories on the basis of correlated biomicroscopic and biochemical findings: 1. Immature cataractous lenses without anterior capsular/subcapsular opacity (ac-sco) were characterized by low CNaL+, high CKL+ and low sums of CNaL++CKL+. 2. Immature cataractous lenses with ac-sco were characterized by intermediate value of CNaL+ and CKL+, as well as high sums of CNAL++CKL+. 3. Totally opaque lenses (these lenses had 80-100% of ac-sco) were characterized by high CNaL+, low CKL+, high sums of CNaL++CKL+, high water, and low dry weight percentages. It was found that in immature cataractous lenses increasing extension of ac-sco was correlated to increasing CNAL+ and increasing ratios of CNAL+/CNAA+ as well as to decreasing CKL+ and decreasing ratios of CKL+/CKA+. The sums of CNaL++CKA+ increased. There was a correlation of the extent of ac=sco to the water and dry weight percentages of the immature senile cataractous lenses with ac-sco, viz. a negative correlation for water and a positive one for the dry weight. However, these latter two correlations may be due to chance significances, the level of significance being only greater than P greater than 0.02 in both instances. Lenses which were estimated to have larger than or equal to 30% of ac-sco were found to be more opaque than lenses with less than or equal to 25% of ac-sco."

During an episode of neutropenia on day 12 after transplantation, pneumonia and sepsis due to multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa developed. Drug susceptibility tests demonstrated resistance to all kinds of intravenous antibiotics available for P. aeruginosa in Japan. Multi-drug susceptibility tests by the breakpoint-checkerboard plate method were then performed and combination therapy with meropenem hydrate and colistin was started based on the test results. After starting treatment, clinical symptoms and laboratory data immediately improved and engraftment of neutrophils was achieved on day 18. Infections with multi-drug-resistant P. aeruginosa are often critical for patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and are difficult to control. In this paper, we report a case of severe multi-drug-resistant P. aeruginosa infection that was successfully treated by combination therapy selected using the breakpoint-checkerboard plate method."

Surprisingly, his blood culture which was taken on admission returned positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae after two days, which was coincident with resolution of fever and diarrhea. This patient had no other clinically apparent source of Pneumococcal infection and we believe that he had Pneumococcal enteritis with bacteremia. There are very few reported cases of isolated Pneumococcal enteritis in the literature. Therefore, we report this unusual form of Streptococcus pneumnoniae infection both because of its rarity and its potentially life-threatening but still curable nature."
CD009647,0,21819316,0,Preservation of residual renal function with limited water removal in hemodialysis patients.,"Residual renal function (RRF) is of paramount importance for hemodialysis (HD) adequacy, morbidity, and mortality. Some studies have shown that overhydration is beneficial for preservation of RRF, but it can also increase the probability of adverse events such as hypertension and heart failure in HD patients. To determine the optimal amount of dehydration, we performed HD with limited water removal in HD patients. Eighteen HD patients included in this self-controlled study underwent HD with limited water removal. Water removal volume was determined by a previous volume as follows. Total water removal volume was divided into levels: ≤3.0, 3.0-9.0, and >9.0 L per week. Water removal was performed to obtain dry weight in the last dialysis, and was performed three times with a ratio of 1:1:2 and 2:2:3, respectively. Urine volume, endogenous creatinine clearance rate, Kt/V, hemoglobin, and serum albumin were recorded before and after the study at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The follow-up period was 12 months. Ten patients withdrew from the study because of adverse events including hypertension (n = 3), heart failure (n = 3), angina (n = 1), polycystic kidney rupture (n = 1), obvious edema (n = 1), and one patient had too much interdialytic weight gain to continue. As a result, we stopped this study after 1 month. Our data suggest that the preservation of RRF with limited water removal in HD patients must be interpreted with caution."

CD009647,0,19059528,0,Changes in plasma lipids with psychosocial stress are related to hypertension status and the norepinephrine stress response.,"Hypertension is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Hypertensive individuals show exaggerated norepinephrine (NE) reactivity to stress. Norepinephrine is a known lipolytic factor. It is unclear if, in hypertensive individuals, stress-induced increases in NE are linked with the elevations in stress-induced circulating lipid levels. Such a mechanism could have implications for atherosclerotic plaque formation. In a cross-sectional, quasi-experimentally controlled study, 22 hypertensive and 23 normotensive men (mean +/- SEM, 45 +/- 3 years) underwent an acute standardized psychosocial stress task combining public speaking and mental arithmetic in front of an audience. We measured plasma NE and the plasma lipid profile (total cholesterol [TC], low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) immediately before and after stress and at 20 and 60 minutes of recovery. All lipid levels were corrected for stress hemoconcentration. Compared with normotensives, hypertensives had greater TC (P = .030) and LDL-C (P = .037) stress responses. Independent of each other, mean arterial pressure (MAP) upon screening and immediate increase in NE predicted immediate stress change in TC (MAP: beta = .41, P = .003; NE: beta = .35, P = .010) and LDL-C (MAP: beta = .32, P = .024; NE: beta = .38, P = .008). Mean arterial pressure alone predicted triglycerides stress change (beta = .32, P = .043) independent of NE stress change, age, and BMI. The MAP-by-NE interaction independently predicted immediate stress change of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = -.58, P < .001) and of LDL-C (beta = -.25, P < .08). We conclude that MAP and NE stress reactivity may elicit proatherogenic changes of plasma lipids in response to acute psychosocial stress, providing one mechanism by which stress might increase cardiovascular risk in hypertension."
CD009647,0,10681641,0,Acute watery diarrhea as the initial presenting feature of a pheochromocytoma in an 84-year-old female patient.,"We report the case of an 84-year-old woman who was initially admitted to the emergency room of our institution for frank dehydration caused by acute and severe secretory diarrheas along with acidosis and hypokalemia. After extensive gastrointestinal investigations, the etiology of the diarrhea remained unclear. Because clinical symptoms and ionogram parameters worsened, despite intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement, an abdominal CT scan was performed and unexpectedly revealed a 4.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland. Several separate 24-hour urine catecholamines were shown to be highly elevated. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed by MIBG scintigraphy and MRI. Before the admission, the patient never experienced symptoms suggestive of pheochromocytoma, except dry mouth and fear of impending death on several occasions. After 2 weeks, the diarrhea stopped abruptly and spontaneously without specific medication but after adequate rehydration. The patient subsequently underwent surgical removal of the adrenal medullary mass. Postoperatively, urinary catecholamines returned to normal values. Immunohistochemical study of the tumor confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and revealed the presence of VIP-positive cells organized as islets in scattered areas of the tissue. This case illustrates the protean mode of presentation of pheochromocytoma, as well as the ability of medullary neural crest-derived cells to produce various neuropeptides potentially responsible for a large variety of symptoms."

Using a controlled, randomized, single-blind clinical design, we studied 46 consecutive patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic hip surgery. The two groups were comparable in age, body weight and duration of surgery. Patients were maintained haemodynamically stable using both HES and MFG over the entire study. Fluid balance and colloidal replacement volumes were comparable in both groups (median perioperative infusion volume: HES 2500 ml, MFG 2400 ml). Laboratory variables were not clinically different. We conclude that both colloidal solutions were comparable in volume efficacy and effects on plasma oncotic pressure, clotting and plasma homeostasis. In the small number of patients studied, 6% HES 200/0.5 was found to be safe when administered in amounts corresponding to the currently accepted maximum daily dose in Germany and France of 33 ml/kg body weight and 2.0 g/kg body weight, respectively."
CD009647,0,16679819,0,Sodium lauryl sulfate-induced irritation in the human face: regional and age-related differences.,"The particular sensitivity of the human face to care products prompted us to study irritation induced by sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in its various regions. We examined regional and age-related differences, correlating basal transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and capacitance to SLS irritation. SLS (2% aq.) was applied under occlusion for 1 h to the forehead, cheek, nose, nasolabial and perioral areas, chin, neck and forearm to two groups of subjects--one with 10 subjects with an average age of 25.2 +/- 4.7 years and another with 10 subjects with an average age of 73.7 +/- 3.9 years. TEWL was measured before and 1 h and 23 h after patch removal. Baseline stratum corneum hydration was also measured. Irritation was assessed by the changes in TEWL (deltaTEWL = TEWL after patch removal - basal TEWL) after corrections to the control. In the younger group, all areas of the face and the neck reacted to SLS, whereas the forearm did not. In the older group, the nose, perioral area and forearm did not react. In both age groups, some significant differences between the regions of the face were detected. The younger group showed higher changes in TEWL than the older group in all the areas studied, but only in the chin and nasolabial area were the differences statistically significant. Significant correlations were found between basal TEWL and deltaTEWL in 5 of the 7 areas which reacted to SLS. Baseline TEWL is one parameter that correlates with the susceptibility of the face to this irritant."
CD009647,0,12611650,0,Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome: how water might contribute to its progression.,"Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is one of the most frequent conditions encountered in intensive-care medicine. MODS is defined as total or partial loss of two or more organs with vital functions. The development of acute renal failure (ARF) in MODS leads to an additional aggravation with considerably higher hospital mortality than in other ICU patients with MODS. Whereas dissolved substances involved in the regulation of regional blood flow, endothelial cell injury, microvascular permeability, oxygenation, and nutrition of cells are at the focus of interest in MODS, hardly any scientific attention is paid to their main solvent water. An impaired renal water excretion and an increased metabolic water volume requiring excretion interfere with diffusive and convective oxygen transport through the different fluid compartments. It will be shown first that the ratio of U(osm)/ P(osm) appears to be a reliable tool to assess overhydration in ARF. Secondly, the limits of urinary output in response to water intake will be considered. Furthermore, the metabolic water formation by an enhanced degradation of endogenous protein and fat will be discussed. Finally, the daily caloric intake is questioned with respect to energy expenditure and metabolic water formation."
CD009647,0,9379700,0,Management of urinary retention: rapid versus gradual decompression and risk of complications.,"The literature was reviewed to quantify the risk of complications related to the relief of obstruction in urinary retention. We also sought to determine whether the risk of complications is higher with rapid or gradual decompression (or ""clamping"") of the obstructed urinary bladder. The medical literature was identified by a search of the MEDLINE database and a manual review of the bibliographies of the identified articles. Studies show that, after quick, complete relief of obstruction, hematuria occurs in 2 to 16% of patients; however, clinically significant hematuria is rare. After relief of obstruction, blood pressure often decreases, but it usually normalizes and does not progress to clinically significant hypotension. Postobstructive diuresis occurs after relief of obstruction in 0.5 to 52% of patients; however, it is easily managed and rarely of clinical significance. We were unable to identify any randomized controlled studies that directly compared quick, complete emptying with gradual emptying of the obstructed bladder. Moreover, we identified no studies supporting the practice of gradual emptying of the obstructed bladder. The available published studies support quick, complete emptying for relief of the obstructed urinary bladder. We conclude that hematuria, hypotension, and postobstructive diuresis may occur after decompression of the obstructed urinary bladder, but these complications are rarely clinically significant. Quick, complete emptying of the obstructed bladder is safe, simple, and effective and is recommended as the optimal method for decompressing the obstructed urinary bladder. Prudent, supportive care is needed for all patients, with special attention to elderly patients and those with hypovolemia."

CD009647,0,9369257,0,Identification of a renin threshold and its relationship to salt intake in a patient with pure autonomic failure.,"Animal studies have demonstrated a threshold below which renin release increases proportionally to a decrease in renal perfusion pressure. Demonstration of a similar mechanism in humans, however, has proved difficult, as any attempt to lower blood pressure below the putative renin threshold results in renin release mediated by reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system. In this study, we report on our observations in a 71-year-old woman who presented with a 20-year history of faintness and syncope and was diagnosed as having pure autonomic failure. Graded head-up tilting resulted in a stepwise reduction in mean arterial blood pressure to a minimum of 54 mm Hg, with no signs of increased sympathetic activity. A fall in blood pressure below 80 mm Hg resulted in a distinct rise in plasma renin activity, and a similar threshold pressure was observed under both a 50- and a 100-mmol/d sodium chloride diet. Below the threshold, response to changes in perfusion pressure was proportionally greater under the 50-mmol/d diet than under a 100- or 200-mmol/d diet. These observations demonstrate that a pressure threshold for renin release at 10 to 15 mm Hg below ambient blood pressure, as described previously in animal studies, is also present in humans. The significance of this pressure-dependent mechanism of renin release for the long-term regulation of blood pressure and water and mineral balance in humans remains to be determined."

CD009647,0,7579073,0,Nutritional assessment with bioelectrical impedance analysis in maintenance hemodialysis patients.,"Protein energy malnutrition is common among persons with ESRD and contributes substantially to morbidity and mortality. The usual methods of nutritional assessment, such as anthropometry, can be misleading because of altered tissue hydration. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has been recommended by some as a practical nutritional assessment tool but has not been validated in patients with ESRD. Thirty-three stable patients on maintenance hemodialysis were evaluated in an ambulatory clinical research center with simultaneous BIA, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and deuterium oxide (D2O) and sodium bromide (NaBr) isotope dilution studies. Standard determinations of total body water (TBW) and body cell mass (BCM) were obtained and compared with values estimated by BIA. Two separate outpatient BIA measurements were also obtained approximately 2 wk before and after the clinical research center evaluation. BCM estimated by BIA was directly correlated (r = 0.92, P < 0.0001) with BCM determined by DEXA and NaBr. TBW estimated by BIA was directly correlated (r = 0.96, P < 0.0001) with TBW determined by deuterium oxide dilution. The reactance to resistance ratio (Xc/R) derived from BIA was inversely correlated (r = -0.73, P < 0.0001) with the extracellular water/TBW ratio determined by NaBr/D2O. Bland-Altman analyses showed that for TBW, BIA was in excellent agreement with D2O dilution. BCM was modestly underestimated by BIA compared with the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry/NaBr standard and was adjusted by linear regression. The coefficients of variation on repeated BIA measurements were below 4%, demonstrating test-retest reliability. BIA is a valid and reliable method of nutritional assessment in maintenance hemodialysis patients."

This randomized clinical trial was undertaken to determine whether administration of supplemental fluid to nursing home residents at risk for pressure ulcers would enhance collagen deposition, increase estimated total body water, augment subcutaneous tissue oxygenation, and was safe. After a baseline period, 64 subjects were randomized to receive the fluid volume prescribed or additional fluid (prescribed plus 10 mL/kg) for 5 days. Participants' potential to heal as measured with hydroxyproline was low at baseline and did not increase significantly during treatment when additional fluid was systematically provided. Fluid intake increased significantly during treatment. Estimates of total body water and subcutaneous oxygen did not increase, indicating hydration was not improved. Supplemental fluid did not result in overhydration as measured by clinical parameters. Further work is needed to examine the relationship between fluid intake and hydration in nursing home residents as well as the role of hydration in pressure ulcer prevention."

Fall-related injuries constitute a serious public health problem associated with high costs for society as well as human suffering. A rapid step is the most important protective postural strategy, acting to recover equilibrium and prevent a fall from initiating. It can arise from large perturbations, but also frequently as a consequence of volitional movements. We propose to use a novel water-based training program which includes specific perturbation exercises that will target the stepping responses that could potentially have a profound effect in reducing risk of falling. We describe the water-based balance training program and a study protocol to evaluate its efficacy (Trial registration number #NCT00708136)."

This is a descriptive correlational study set in seven nursing homes in eastern Iowa. Ninety-eight nursing home residents > or =65 years of age participated. Exclusion criteria for the study included: unstable congestive heart failure or diabetes, documented renal disease, hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 meq/L), terminal illness, acutely confused/delirious or urinary tract infection at baseline, and gastrostomy-tube dependence. Weekly urine specimens were collected. Ucol was measured first, using a urine color chart. Usg was determined using the Chemstrip Mini UA Urine Analyzer. Week-by-week Spearman rank order correlations between urine color and specific gravity for the total sample (n=98) ranged from r(s) = 0.3 - 0.7, p < .01; the PROC mixed model was significant, p < .01. In subgroup analyses (n=78), all females (r(s) = 0.67, p = .01) and both males (r(s) = 0.53, p = .01) and females (r(s) = 0.72, p =.01) with adequate renal function (Cockcroft-Gault estimated creatinine clearance [CrCl] values of > or =50 ml/min) had significant associations between average urine color and average Usg. Females with mild renal impairment (CrCl between 30 and 50 ml/min) also had significant associations between Ucol and Usg (r(s) = .64, p < .01). Ucol averaged over several individual readings offers another tool in assessing hydration status in Caucasian nursing home residents with adequate renal function measures by estimated CrCl values."

CD009647,0,8422000,0,Spironolactone in congestive heart failure refractory to high-dose loop diuretic and low-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.,"Patients with severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional classes III-IV) often can tolerate only low doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors because pronounced hypotension caused by additional ACE inhibitor increments may decrease renal perfusion. The use of high-dose loop diuretics is currently advised to overcome diuretic resistance in refractory congestive heart failure (CHF). In a baseline controlled study, we evaluated 21 patients with diuretic resistance and evident fluid retention for the responses to 5 days of double drug therapy consisting of high-dose loop diuretic (10 mg oral bumetanide) in combination with the maximum tolerable dose of an ACE inhibitor (individualized to blood pressure and kidney function). Five patients (24%) showed a gross natriuresis and reduction in excess weight > 25% in response to this therapy. The remaining 16 patients (76%) with insufficient responses (i.e., < 25% reduction in excess weight) subsequently received 100 mg spironolactone once a day for 7 days in addition to the double therapy. Spironolactone coadministration was highly effective in 13 of 16 patients (81%). Marked natriuresis and diuresis were achieved within the next week of treatment, and CHF symptoms regressed or disappeared. The clinical course was similar in the bumetanide-ACE inhibitor and the bumetanide-ACE inhibitor-spironolactone treatment (triple therapy) groups. Plasma aldosterone was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the patients who needed spironolactone.

In absence of deep vein thrombosis, MO is caused by the change in the dynamics of calf muscle pump with venous hypertension and by the change in capillary permeability which offsets the extra-vascular fluid balance resulting in edema formation. The correct treatment includes specific training for musculo-skeletal and gait recovery, together with medical treatment focused on venous endothelium. Little information is available about pharmacological treatment of this condition. Some studies suggest the efficacy of mesoglycan in venous pathology.

Insulin deficiency is the main precipitating factor. Diabetic ketoacidosis can occur in persons of all ages, with 14 percent of cases occurring in persons older than 70 years, 23 percent in persons 51 to 70 years of age, 27 percent in persons 30 to 50 years of age, and 36 percent in persons younger than 30 years. The case fatality rate is 1 to 5 percent. About one-third of all cases are in persons without a history of diabetes mellitus. Common symptoms include polyuria with polydipsia (98 percent), weight loss (81 percent), fatigue (62 percent), dyspnea (57 percent), vomiting (46 percent), preceding febrile illness (40 percent), abdominal pain (32 percent), and polyphagia (23 percent). Measurement of A1C, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum glucose, electrolytes, pH, and serum ketones; complete blood count; urinalysis; electrocardiography; and calculation of anion gap and osmolar gap can differentiate diabetic ketoacidosis from hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, gastroenteritis, starvation ketosis, and other metabolic syndromes, and can assist in diagnosing comorbid conditions. Appropriate treatment includes administering intravenous fluids and insulin, and monitoring glucose and electrolyte levels. Cerebral edema is a rare but severe complication that occurs predominantly in children. Physicians should recognize the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis for prompt diagnosis, and identify early symptoms to prevent it. Patient education should include information on how to adjust insulin during times of illness and how to monitor glucose and ketone levels, as well as information on the importance of medication compliance."

The age of the patient varied from 18 to 70 years. 37 patients were women and 45 man. Volume of excreted fluid fluctuated from 100 ml to 3000 ml per day. The most frequent cause of pefgt was dehiscence of the anastomosis of jejunum in 31 patients, and operations of complications of gastric or duodenal ulcer disease in 30 patients. 54 patients underwent medical treatment. It was based on compensation of disorders in water and electrolyte balance and acid-base equilibrium, nutritional treatment, protection of the skin, suction of the excreted fluid, controlling of foci of infection, rehabilitation. 7 patients were reoperated for the purpose of closing the fistula and 21 to drain abscess or to stop bleeding. 57 (70%) out of 82 patients recovered, 25 (30%) died.

CD009647,0,9220319,0,A prospective randomized evaluation of the prophylactic use of low-dose dopamine in cancer patients receiving interleukin-2.,"The administration of high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) causes tumor regression in 17-25% of patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma. Renal dysfunction is a common dose-limiting toxicity of IL-2 administration, limiting 26% of treatment cycles. We have conducted a prospective randomized trial to evaluate whether the prophylactic administration of low-dose dopamine (2 mg/kg/min) can minimize renal toxicity and thus affect the amount of IL-2 administered. Forty-two patients were randomly assigned to receive systemic high-dose IL-2 with standard supportive measures (group A = 21 patients) or with the addition of prophylactic dopamine (group B = 21 patients) at 2 mg/kg/min. For patients in group B, dopamine was instituted 1 h before the initiation of IL-2 administration and was discontinued 6-12 h after the maximum number of doses of IL-2 were given. There was no difference in the amount of IL-2 administered for each course of therapy for groups A and B. Despite differences in urine flow (milliliters per kilogram per day), fluid balance (liters per day), and overall weight gain, prophylactic low-dose dopamine did not significantly alter maximum plasma urea or creatinine levels in group B when compared with the control group (group A). The overall toxicity profile considering all grade 3 and 4 toxicities for patients in groups A and B was comparable. Thus, there is no evidence to support the routine use of prophylactic low-dose dopamine in patients receiving high-dose IL-2."
CD009647,0,6402051,0,The effect of isotonic amino acid infusions on serum proteins and muscle breakdown following surgery.,"Twenty patients undergoing major surgical procedures received constant infusion (21/day) of either 3.5 per cent amino acid (AA) or 5 per cent dextrose (D5W) solutions in addition to other fluid requirements for 4 postoperative days. Ketosis was evident in AA patients as a mean daily beta-hydroxy butyrate excretion of 2.16 +/- 1.39 mmol and respiratory quotient of 0.708 +/- 0.013 compared with 0.28 +/- 0.45 mmol/day and 0.754 +/- 0.015 respectively in the D5W group. The serum total protein and albumin concentrations (but not those of transferrin and prealbumin) were significantly higher in the AA than the D5W group on day 4. However, the mean fluid balance for days 3 and 4 was significantly less positive in AA patients. The mean daily nitrogen balance of -6.6 +/- 7.7 gN/day in AA patients and -9.5 +/- 5.8 gN/day in D5W patients was not significantly different. Mean daily 3-methyl histidine excretion (38.2 +/- 12.3 mumol/mmol creatinine) in AA patients was significantly higher than in D5W patients (31.2 +/- 10.8 mumol/mmol creatinine). With no improvement in nitrogen balance, an increase in muscle protein breakdown and the possibility that decreased fluid retention explains the higher serum total protein and albumin levels, this study fails to demonstrate improved protein sparing by isotonic amino acid infusions following surgery."
CD009647,0,3968903,0,Indications for ultrafiltration in the cardiac surgical patient.,"Ultrafiltration is an extracorporeal technique that employs the principle of convective solute transport across a semipermeable membrane and by which plasma water is removed from blood. Ultrafiltration has been employed in 74 cardiac surgical patients intraoperatively, preoperatively, and postoperatively. In 55 patients with clinical evidence of excess body water, the ultrafilter was employed at the start of cardiopulmonary bypass. The amount of ultrafiltrate removed was 2,914 +/- 1,662 ml (SD), and the fluid balance was -219 +/- 1,298 ml (SD). In 17 patients the ultrafilter was inserted during bypass because of excess reservoir volumes, low hematocrit, or prolonged bypass time. The amount of ultrafiltrate removed was 1,450 +/- 898 ml (SD), and the fluid balance was 1,296 +/- 2,161 ml (SD). One patient with cardiopulmonary failure and nutritional depletion underwent slow continuous ultrafiltration preoperatively along with intravenous alimentation, producing a positive nitrogen balance and improvement in cardiorespiratory failure. One patient underwent slow continuous ultrafiltration for severe, diuretic-resistant congestive heart failure postoperatively. After 9 days of ultrafiltration, there was an 8 kg weight loss, an improvement in congestive heart failure, and a return of the response to diuretics. From this experience my colleagues and I have developed the following indications for ultrafiltration in the cardiac surgical patient: during cardiopulmonary bypass to prevent further fluid accumulation in the patient with clinical evidence of excess body water; during bypass to prevent excess fluid balance in a patient whose bypass time will be greater than 2 hours; during bypass when the pump reservoir volumes are excessive and/or the hematocrit is less than 18%; preoperatively or postoperatively to increase caloric intake in the fluid-overloaded patient; and preoperatively or postoperatively to reverse severe congestive heart failure in the diuretic-resistant patient."
CD009647,0,12092636,0,Molecular physiology of urinary concentration defect in elderly population.,"It is estimated that by the year 2050 one in five Americans will be 65 years or older. This mandates the growing need for clinical and basic research in the field of geriatric medicine to understand age-related maladies. The most prominent abnormality in renal function in the aging population is the inability to handle water, frequently resulting in hypo- or hyperosmolar states, and the associated electrolyte imbalances. During the past decade, thanks to the advent of powerful molecular techniques, rapid strides have been made in the approaches employed to understand and dissect the physiology of renal function in general and the urinary concentration mechanism in particular. Using an integrated approach of clinical observations, experimental model systems, molecular analysis, and functional genomics, a more comprehensive picture of the interplay of physiological systems in the genesis of urinary concentration defect in the elderly is beginning to emerge. Much remains to be deciphered regarding the complex interactions between the role of environment, genetics, diet, pharmacological agents and the general effects of aging on kidney function. The emerging importance of socio-economic and quality of life issues surrounding geriatric medicine encourage public and private support and funding for research in the area of age-related diseases, especially as they are related to the kidney."

CD009647,0,2961256,0,Amlodipine therapy corrects renal abnormalities encountered in the hypertensive state.,"Calcium antagonists may increase glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow by antagonizing the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II and/or norepinephrine. We prospectively studied the effects of amlodipine, a once-a-day dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, in 19 patients with essential hypertension. Studies were performed after 4 weeks of placebo and 6 weeks of amlodipine therapy, and included the assessment of systolic and diastolic BP, renal clearances of inulin and p-aminohippurate, and determination of body fluid composition. Systolic and diastolic BPs were reduced following 6 weeks of amlodipine monotherapy. In spite of significant decreases in mean arterial pressure, there were increases in inulin clearance (+ 13%), and p-aminohippurate clearance (+ 19%). Filtration fraction was not changed. Renal vascular resistance was decreased (-25%). Total blood volume, extracellular fluid volume, and total body water and body weight were not changed. We conclude that amlodipine therapy has the potential to reverse renal abnormalities encountered in the hypertensive state."
CD009647,0,17041253,0,Obesity: changing the face of geriatric care.,"Statistics suggest that more and more older Americans are carrying extra weight-an estimated 40% of individuals between the ages of 60 and 69 have a body mass index >30 and 30% of persons between ages of 70 and 79 years are obese. Obesity, coupled with the challenges of aging, leads to an unfortunate burden of chronic disease, functional decline, poor quality of life, and an increased risk of being homebound. Physical assessment of the elderly obese patient should include measurement of height, weight (to determine body mass index) and waist circumference (to address central obesity) and consideration of vascular, skin, and mobility issues. Weight management strategies such as diet and hydration should balance nutritional requirements with weight loss; particular attention to protein needs in chair- and bedbound patients is necessary. Additional approaches such as exercise, bariatric weight loss surgery, and weight loss medication should be considered on an individual basis related to their inherent risks in this population. Weight loss/management options framed from an interdisciplinary perspective can improve quality of life for these patients and their caregivers. Research specific to obesity in this age group is warranted."
CD009647,0,6538131,0,The effect of phototherapy on extracellular water and transvascular protein exchange in psoriasis.,"Seven patients with stable psoriasis vulgaris were treated with phototherapy (Goeckerman or PUVA) for 3 to 4 weeks. By combining the suction blister technique with studies on labelled albumin and inulin, the intra- and extravascular fluid volumes, the leakage of albumin from the total and the skin microvasculature, and the intra- and extravascular masses of albumin were measured before and after therapy. In accordance with previous studies, a shift of fluid from the intra- to the extravascular spaces, an increased leakiness of the involved skin microvasculature, and a lowered total mass of body albumin were found before therapy. Treatment induced a minor increase of the extracellular fluid volume [mean, 6.20 +/- 1.16 l/m2 (SD) v. 6.73 +/- 0.95 l/m2 (SD), P less than 0.1], a reduced vascular leakage of albumin from the involved skin vessels, and a significant increase of the total mass of albumin [mean, 124 +/- 20 g/m2 (SD) v. 139 +/- 30 g/m2 (SD), P less than 0.05]. The other measured variables did not change significantly. It is suggested that the observed change in extracellular fluid volume was mainly due to a treatment-induced decrease of the transepidermal water loss and/or a subclinical oedema of the skin, whereas the increase in total albumin mass was due to a reduction of the catabolism of the endogenous albumin caused by the decrease in the microvascular leakiness of the involved skin vessels."
CD009647,0,19558258,0,Vancomycin-induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis.,"Vancomycin is well recognized as causing the nonallergic skin reaction known as red man syndrome; however, it is rarely suspected as causative in the setting of an immune-mediated skin reaction. We describe a 76-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of penicillin and sulfa allergies who was transferred to our medical center while receiving vancomycin for treatment of persistent methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. After admission, the patient's pacemaker was explanted; cultures from the pacemaker grew MSSA. Based on the culture data and her allergy to penicillin, vancomycin was continued. On day 4 of therapy, the patient developed a papular rash with small blisters on her distal upper extremities. Furosemide, which she was receiving intermittently to maintain fluid balance, was initially suspected as the likely cause. Furosemide was withheld; however, the rash worsened and spread to her neck and torso. Results of skin biopsy confirmed a severe leukocytoclastic, necrotizing small-cell vasculitis that met the criteria for a hypersensitivity vasculitis associated with drug therapy. Five days after discontinuation of vancomycin, the vasculitis was resolving and continued to resolve throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.

The sequential variation (before and after ESWL) of various biochemical parameters of the blood and 24-hour urine was analysed in 50 patients. A significant increase of urinary N-Acetyl-Glucosaminidase (NAG), urinary NAG/urinary creatinine quotient, proteinuria, serum creatinine and potassium was detected during the 24 hours following ESWL. A significant fall in creatinine clearance, urinary osmolarity and uric acid clearance was also detected. A positive correlation was observed between these alterations, the number of shocks and the kilovoltage used. On the 7th and 15th days, no significant difference was observed compared to the baseline values before ESWL. This can be explained by the fact that the lesions caused by shock waves are already in the repair phase."

Significant correlations between the rates of change of these variables were not obtained, but the overall response of intraocular pressure correlated with the overall increase of plasma glucose, which also correlated with the increase of osmolality. These results show that the changes in refraction associated with acute hyperglycaemia arise from adjustments in fluid balance between intraocular compartments."

The process of aging, together with an unhealthy diet and little physical exercise, often leads to deterioration of this ideal. Two open clinical trials were conducted to investigate the effect of the proprietary oral supplement INVERSION Femme (Inversion Laboratoires, Hasselt, Belgium) on slimming in overweight women and on hair loss, as well as on skin and nail parameters. A total of 22 overweight women aged 38 to 63 y participated in the study that explored slimming activity. In the hair loss study, 30 women aged 38 to 67 y who had experienced hair loss were examined. All 52 women in both groups were further evaluated for skin (ie, wrinkles and hydration) and nail improvement. The active ingredients in INVERSION Femme, subdivided into 2 different capsules, exhibit antioxidative activity and nutritional function; in addition, they contribute to enhanced microcirculation, tonus, and thermogenesis. Weight reduction and slimming were measured after INVERSION Femme was taken for 28 and 58 d. All women showed significant reductions in weight, body fat, and thigh circumference. During the second month of treatment, subjects showed an average 50% reduction in hair loss. INVERSION Femme is a potent ""all-in-one"" antiaging dietary supplement that causes significant slimming and reduction in hair loss, as well as visible improvement in skin and nail structure."

CD009647,0,939064,0,Effect of vasopressin on uric acid excretion: evidence for distal nephron reabsorption of urate in man.,"1. When changes in urine flow rate were induced by vasopressin administration in eight subjects, urate excretion decreased by a mean of 14% and was positively correlated with urine flow rate (r = 0.88, P less than 0.01). The effect of vasopressin on urate excretion was not influenced by prior changes in extracellular fluid volume. 2. Mannitol administration in a dose sufficient to prevent vasopressin-induced alterations in urine flow rate blocked the effect of vasopressin on urate excretion. 3. Alterations in urate excretion produced by changes in extracellular fluid volume could be distinguished from the urate-retaining effect of vasopressin-mediated decrease in urine flow. Urate retention after vasopressin was entirely attributed to a decrease in pyrazinamide-suppressible urate excretion, consistent with either decreased secretion or enhanced post-secretory reabsorption of urate. 4. Since diminished urine flow rate in the distal part of the nephron is more likely to lead to enhanced reabsorption of urate, these results provide additional evidence for urate reabsorption in the distal part of the nephron."
CD009647,0,20721271,0,[Advances in clinical study of nocturia].,"Nocturia is one of the most common reasons for interrupted sleep in general adult population. The condition affects both men and women, with an incidence that increases dramatically with age. Nocturia has a negative impact on quality of life, affecting both morbidity and mortality. International Continence Society (ICS) issued a report of terminology standardization in 2002, in which nocturia is defined as waking during the night at least once to urinate. Nocturia is a common complaint in elderly population. Although most cases of nocturia are assumed to be caused by urologic problems, the interacting effects of aging and sleep on renal and urinary function, in fact, cause nocturia in the elderly. Effective diagnosis of the condition is dependent on a clear understanding of its underlying etiology. Multiple factors may cause nocturia, such as behavioral or environmental factors and pathologic conditions. In general, the causes of nocturia fall into three categories: diurnal polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, and low bladder capacity. Careful evaluation of medications and underlying medical conditions is essential for the proper management of nocturia. A voiding diary is necessary to diagnose the syndrome of nocturnal polyuria, which is a common cause of nocturia. Addressing any underlying conditions that contribute to nocturia is the first step in treating the condition. Lifestyle and behavioral changes may provide benefit in some individuals, but for many cases, pharmacotherapy is the best option. Antimuscarinic agents are first-line therapies for overactive bladder and are often used in the management of nocturia. Current treatment options also include desmopressin, a synthetic analog of arginine vasopressin, which can increase urinary osmolality and decrease total urinary volume. The desmopressin therefore increases the length of time until the first nocturnal void and decreases the number of nocturnal voids, the NUV voided, and the percentage of urine voided at night."

The more common causes of hyponatremia could be ruled out. There was no evidence for a neuroleptic drug associated change in serum sodium concentration. We conclude that the patient in this study belongs to a subset of geriatric patients in whom there is an intermittent SIADH which only becomes clinically evident when several factors coincide. The underlying mechanisms are not understood but could include the interaction of subclinical cerebrovascular disease and treatment with a neuroleptic drug in an elderly patient whose water and sodium homeostasis is compromised by the changes of normal aging which affect the many systems involved in maintaining water and sodium balance.

CD009647,0,11197633,0,The calculation of blood ethanol concentrations in males and females.,"In German-speaking countries, blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) are usually calculated using Widmark's equation. The distribution factor r of this equation is a correction factor needed to obtain a reduced body mass and corresponds to the ratio of total body water and blood water content. To enhance the reliability of Widmark's model equation, the body weight, body height, blood water content and total body water of 256 women and 273 men were measured. The ratio of body water to blood water ranged from 0.44 to 0.80 in women and from 0.60 to 0.87 in men. For both sexes equations were developed by multiple regression analysis which allow the determination of the individual, more realistic distribution factors rFI (for females) and rMI (for males) even when only body height and body weight are known. Drinking experiments revealed a clearly higher congruence of calculated and measured blood ethanol concentrations when rFI or rMI were used instead of rigid distribution factors, i.e. 0.6 for women and 0.7 for men with or without the assumption of a 10% so-called resorption deficit. Additionally, Widmark's equation in combination with rFI or rMI allows a more accurate prediction of blood ethanol concentrations than the equations of Watson and Ulrich."

CD009647,0,10554565,0,[Five elderly patients with cerebral infarction seen during a heat wave].,"Five elderly patients (> or = 65 y) with cerebral infarction induced by dehydration during a heat wave were described to clarify the relationship between dehydration and stroke in the aged. When the daily maximum temperature exceeded 30 degrees C every day for two weeks, 6 patients with acute stroke came to our hospital. Five of them were patients with cerebral infarction aged 73-89 (the elderly group) and one was a 52-year-old woman with putaminal hemorrhage. As control groups, patients with ischemic stroke during the period 4 weeks before and after, but excluding the heat wave period, which consisted of an elderly control group (n = 7) and a young control group (n = 5), were also studied retrospectively with regard to clinical findings and neuroimaging. The incidence of cerebral infarction in the elderly group was higher in the heat wave period among all three groups. Atherothrombotic, lacunar, and cardioembolic infarctions were seen in 1, 2 and 2 cases, respectively. The onset in the elderly group was characteristic as all occurred before noon and were related to exercise. Physical examination at arrival revealed decreased skin turgor and dry tongue. A high BUN/creatinine ratio (> or = 25) and elevated fibrinogen (> 400 mg/dl) was frequently noted, although high hematocrit (> or = 45) was not seen. According to clinical findings, dehydration was diagnosed and they were infused with fluid, resulting in the improvement of skin turgor and tongue moisture. These findings indicated that dehydration due to excess perspiration due to the heat wave induced cerebral infarction in the elderly. It suggests that water intake on awakening in summer is important to prevent dehydration and ischemic stroke because elderly people are especially susceptible to those conditions in the morning."
CD009647,0,2147044,0,A comparative study of groups by age for the intra- and postoperative water and electrolyte management of oesophageal carcinoma.,"The present study examined the effects of subtotal oesophagectomy through a right thoracal and abdominal approach, on the postoperative water-electrolyte metabolism and cardio-pulmonary function of patients with thoracic oesophageal carcinoma. The primary water balance, total sodium intake, urinary NAG index, free-water clearance (CH2O), oxygen diffusion function of the lungs to aerate blood (DLO2-Index), and alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide (alpha-hANP) were measured perioperatively until the seventh day. Subjects were divided by age according to whether they were older or younger than 70 years into 2 groups. In both groups, no change was observed in the primary water balance, total sodium intake, urinary NAG index or CH2O. However, all of the patients in the older group exhibited significantly higher alpha-hANP values than those in the control group, and the DLO2-Index was also higher in the former subjects during the first 3 days following surgery. It may be concluded that alpha-hANP is a hormone of considerable importance as it is secreted in large amounts in response to increased stress on the cardio-pulmonary system and serves to normalize the water balance causing this extra load."

There are no clinical comparisons to acute hemodialysis (HD). We studied control of uremia, electrolyte and fluid balance, and incidence of bleeding, hypotension, and tachyarrhythmia in 4 patients randomly alternated between CAVH and HD. The side effects both during and 4.3 hrs after each HD (total 88 + 97 = 187 hrs) were analyzed to allow time comparison. Five CAVH treatments (total 187 hrs) where 147 L BUN clearance and 10.9 kg net ultrafiltration (UF) occurred; and 23 HD (88 hrs) where 790 L BUN clearance and an UF of 34 kg were compared. Uremia and fluid and electrolyte control were achieved by all treatments except one CAVH session. Two patients had bleeding episodes on CAVH, and none on HD, despite careful minimal heparinization. There were 2 episodes of sudden hypotension on CAVH versus 6 on or after HD. Per unit time, there were 3 times as many episodes of hypotension with HD. Four episodes of sustained tachyarrhythmia occurred on CAVH, and 5 occurred on or after HD. When these side effects were more meaningfully normalized to BUN clearance, there were twice as many hypotensive events and 4 times as many tachyarrhythmic episodes on CAVH as on HD, although UF rate was 7 times faster on HD. CAVH is simple to do, but has more clinical ill effects than HD when normalized to treatment efficiency. The continuous heparinization necessary for CAVH is potentially dangerous, despite careful monitoring. The clinical safety of CAVH has probably been over-rated, and it best may be suited to patients with acute renal failure who do poorly on HD."

The results obtained were as follows: The plasma ADH level was 4.0 pg/ml before surgery, 59 pg/ml after skin incision, 190 pg/ml after thoracotomy, and 276 pg/ml after vagotomy (right esophageal branch). Elevation of the plasma ADH level was partially suppressed by epidural analgesia combined with GOF anesthesia. The main factors that elevate plasma ADH level during surgery were pain at the skin incision, the manipulation of the pleura and vagotomy. The plasma ADH level was high (114 pg/ml) just after surgery and decreased to a normal level (4.3 pg/ml) in the morning of the 2nd postoperative day. Urinary volume was 74 ml/h before surgery, 95 ml/h just after surgery and 40 ml/h in the morning of the 1st postoperative day, and then, continued to gradual increase. There was no correlation between urinary volume and plasma ADH level during surgery until the 1st postoperative day. Elevation of plasma ADH level was not a primary factor of oliguiria during and just after surgery."
CD009647,0,9870433,0,Acute renal failure of medical type in an elderly population.,"One hundred and nine unselected patients with Acute Renal Failure (ARF) of medical aetiology were hospitalized at the Nephrological Unit of Policlinico University Hospital (Modena) during a 30-month period. ARF was considered as a rapid increase of serum creatinine > 2mg/dl over the baseline level or the doubling of pre-existing value in chronic renal failure. Mean age of patients was 67+/-17 years and median age was 72; 64.2% needing dialytic treatment. Four main causes of ARF were identified: 33 patients had reduced renal perfusion by dehydration, hypotension etc.; 20 multifactorial aetiology; 14 biopsy-investigated renal parenchymal diseases and 39 had drug-related acute renal failure (D-ARF). The clinical outcome was significantly worse in elderly patients as regard mortality (P < 0.02), chronic dialytic treatment (P < 0.04) and complete recovery (P < 0.004). The mean age of D-ARF patients was significantly greater than remaining ARF patients (72.6+/-12.8 vs 63.2+/-18.5: P < 0.004. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and ACE-inhibitors (Ace-i) caused ARF in 24 and 8 patients respectively. Elderly age, vascular disease and monoclonal gammopathy represented the main risk factors and were significantly more frequent in D-ARF patients (P<001, <0.01, <0.04 respectively). Our data confirm the high susceptibility of ageing kidneys to nephrotoxic damage caused by drugs affecting glomerular autoregulation by microvascular mechanisms. Greater attention to renal changes in ageing and an increased dissemination of preventative measures among nephrologists, could reduce the incidence of these serious and potentially lethal diseases."
CD009647,0,995309,0,[Emergency stiuations connected with electrolyte disorders. Special aspects].,"Electrolyte-induced situations which are dangerous to life usually result from disturbances of the extracellular volume (ECV), osmolarity, the potassium level or the acid-base equilibrium. In recent years (thanks to the wide spread use of hormone therapy for mammary carcinoma) severe hypercalcemia has increased in importance as a life-threatening complication, while hypocalcemia, at least in adults, should only very seldom lead to unexpected emergencies. As long as serious clinical symptoms do not suggest an emergency, assessment of the threat to the patient as a result of the existing electrolyte disturbance often causes some difficulty. Besides the extent of the deviation from normal, the rate of development of the disturbance determines the resulting danger: chronic hypo-osmolarity, and especially hyperosmolarity are occasionally tolerated without symptoms while acute disturbances of the same or a less extent lead to severe central nervous symptoms. A similar state of affairs is also true of the emergency situations arising from disturbances of the acid-base equilibrium, among which the respiratory disorders are particularly important clinically. In the case of threatening disorders of the potassium metabolism, the accompanying circumstances (digitalis, simultaneous disorders and treatment of the acid-base equilibrium) often determine the clinical significance and danger to the patient. Clinical symptoms, anticipation (""expecting the unexpected""), prevention and treatment of emergency situations of fluid volume, osmolarity, potassium and acid-base equilibrium are the subjects of this paper."
CD009647,0,995307,0,[Water and potassium metabolism changes].,"The disturbances of water and electrolyte metabolism in the body can be subdivided into three large groups: 1) disturbances of free water which are related to the whole body water and are always coupled with changes in the osmolality of the internal environment and also of the interior of the cells (hypertension due to loss of water, hypotension in water intoxication); 2) isotonic changes of the volume of the extracellular fluid-oedema or extracellular dehydration. The latter are always coupled with a hypovolaemia and with a danger to the circulation which may end in shock. There is also a cumulative loss of potassium as a result of the dehydration reaction; 3) disturbances of the intracellular water metabolism which are associated with disturbances of the potassium metabolism. These may have grave consequences for the function of striated and smooth muscles, for the function of the nerves and various enzyme systems. Since the disorders of the extracellular water balance are generally best known, the attention is principally drawn in this paper to the hypertonic dehydration and the status of the potassium metabolism. The symptomatology of both conditions is discussed, and also their diagnosis with the simplest laboratory effort not associated with great loss of time (which is essential if valuable time is not to be lost before the laboratory results can be obtained). The theoretical considerations are supplemented with clinical examples and explanations of the treatment."

The management of a high-output ileostomy is based upon three principles: correction of electrolyte disturbance and fluid balance, pharmacological reduction of ileostomy output, and treatment of any underlying identifiable cause. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that Clostridium difficile may behave pathologically in the small intestine producing a spectrum of enteritis that mirrors the well-recognised colonic disease manifestation. Clinically this can range from high-output ileostomy to fulminant enteritis. This report describes two cases of high-output ileostomy associated with enteric C difficile infection and proposes that the management algorithm of a high-output ileostomy should include exclusion of small bowel C difficile."

Subjects were 60 healthy males aged 30 +/- 18.3 yr (18-74) and 31 healthy females aged 37 +/- 17.5 yr (19-70). Total body water determined by the analysis of the dilution of orally ingested deuterium oxide (1g2H2O, 99.75 atom % excess/kg body weight) in urine. Bioelectrical impedance was measured for each subjects in a supine position using an electrical impedance analyzer (500 microA, 50kHz, T-1988K, Toyo Physical Inc.) with a four electrodes (Y-250, Nihon Kohden). The mean values of total body water and the impedance in males and females subjects were 34.1 +/- 4.27 l and 25.7 +/- 2.42 l, 567 +/- 28.5 omega and 562 +/- 32.5 omega, respectively. Height squared divided by resistance (Ht2/R) correlated well with TBW as measured by 2H2 O, r = 0.530 (p less than 0.001) in males and r = 0.782 (p less than 0.001) in females.

CD009647,0,2212254,0,Gentamicin volume of distribution in critically ill septic patients.,"Gentamicin intrapatient pharmacokinetics variations were studied in 40 critically ill medical patients, suffering gram-negative sepsis. These patients were studied in two phases throughout gentamicin treatment: firstly, on the second day of treatment, when aggressive fluid therapy was required, and secondly, five days later, when patients had achieved a more stable clinical condition. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using least squares linear regression analysis assuming a one-compartment model using the Sawchuk-Zaske method. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) in the first phase of the study was 0.43 +/- 0.12 L/kg, while on the seventh day of treatment it was 0.29 +/- 0.17 L/kg (p less than 0.001). Statistically significant differences were also observed for peak serum concentration (p less than 0.001), total dosage recommended (p less than 0.001) and half-life (p less than 0.05), whilst differences were not found for trough levels. From the analysis of the results obtained, we recommend increasing the initial dosage and monitoring plasma levels within the first days of therapy in critically ill patients treated with gentamicin, since important variations in aminoglycoside Vd related to disease, fluid balance and renal function, commonly occur in these patients."
CD009647,0,8203359,0,Glomerular and tubular factors in urine flow rates of acute renal failure patients.,"Distinguishing between oliguric and nonoliguric acute renal failure (ARF) has clinical relevance. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the pathophysiologic basis for variations in urine flow rates in ARF. This study was designed to determine whether differences in residual levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or differences in tubular reabsorption of filtered solutes and H2O accounted for the variations in urine flow rates among ARF patients. Twenty-five patients with ARF of 3 to 6 days duration having ischemic and nephrotoxic etiologies, increasing serum creatinines of more than 0.7 mg/dL/d, urine sodium concentrations and fractional excretions of sodium (FENa) of more than 20 mEq/L and more than 1%, respectively, 12 hours after stopping diuretics and urine sediments consistent with acute tubular necrosis were studied. Urine and serum collections were made over an 8-hour period to determine creatinine clearance (Ccr), filtered osmolar load, urine to serum creatinine ratio (U/Scr), urine to serum creatinine osmolality (U/Sosm), and FENa. These were compared with urine flow rates. Creatinine clearance was validated as an estimate of GFR in ARF with simultaneous inulin clearances x 12 measurements (r = 0.935, P < 0.001). Residual Ccr was strongly correlated with urine flow rate (r = 0.857, P < 0.001), as was filtered osmolar load (r = 0.810, P < 0.001). However, the latter relationship was totally dependent on Ccr. There was no correlation between U/Scr, U/Sosm, or FENa and urine flow rates. It is concluded that the residual level of GFR is the primary determinant of variations in urine flow rate in patients with ARF."

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 257 patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were randomised to receive QVA149 (indacaterol/NVA237) 600/100 microg, 300/100 microg or 150/100 microg, indacaterol 300 μg or placebo, once daily for 14 days. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in 24-h mean heart rate versus placebo on Day 14. 255 patients were included in the safety analysis (mean age 63.8 years, 76.5% male, post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV(1)] 53.2% predicted, FEV(1)/FVC [forced vital capacity] 50.0%, mean 24-h heart rate 79.6 bpm). There were no clinically significant differences in the 24-h mean heart rate on Day 14 between the three doses of QVA149 and placebo or indacaterol. The confidence intervals of these treatment differences (contrasts) were within the pre-specified equivalence limit (-5 to 5 bpm). No clinically relevant differences in QTc interval (Fridericia's) were observed between groups on Days 1, 7 and 14. Once-daily QVA149 was well tolerated in COPD patients with a cardiovascular safety profile and overall adverse event rates similar to placebo."
CD009647,0,8465228,0,Cicatricial pemphigoid.,"This case of CP is of interest because of its ""not-so-benign"" course in this patient, its unusual immunofluorescence patterns, and the need for a complex therapeutic regimen to achieve control. This patient had severe ocular; laryngeal, and oropharyngeal involvement leading to visual problems, hoarseness, and marked weight loss and dehydration. He also had anemia thought to be partially related to dapsone use. We believe the side effects of dapsone, combined with fluid retention due to prednisone therapy, contributed to cardiac failure. The diagnosis of CP is usually established by correlation of clinical findings with immunofluorescence studies. However, indirect immunofluorescence may show strong intercellular antibody binding in the epidermis (ie, pemphigus-like antibodies). Treatment alternatives for patients with CP who have adverse reactions to, or no significant benefit from, conventional agents such as dapsone or prednisone may include immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. As this case demonstrates, care of patients having CP involves a cooperative effort from a number of different specialties, including dermatology, primary care, ophthalmology, and otolaryngology."

CD009647,0,403755,0,Parenteral nutrition of adults with a 900 milliosmolar solution via peripheral veins.,"The objective of this study was to compare the nutritional value of three parenteral fluids: a conventional solution (400 milliosmoles/liter, containing Na, K, and Cl in 5% glucose); the concentrated hyperalimentation solution of Dudrick (1,800 milliosmoles/liter, containing Na, K, Cl, Mg, Ca, P, and amino acids in 20% glucose); and an experimental solution (900 millisomoles/liter, containing Na, K, Cl, Mg, Ca, P, and amino acids in 6.5% glucose). These three solutions are termed P400, C1,800, and P900, respectively. Preliminary studies showed that when 5 mg of cortisol/liter were added to P900, this fluid could be infused through peripheral veins for as long a time (average 114 hr) as P400 before local reaction necessitated changing the site. When P400 was infused in undernourished subjects without oral intake, balances of N, P, Mg, and Ca/70 kg of body weight per day were strongly negative (-4 g, -0.4 g, -6 mEq, and -0.2 g, respectively), whereas balances of K were about zero and those of Na and Cl were positive. Weight loss occurred. In the same patients, P900 containing 5 mg of cortisol/liter converted balances of N, P, Mg, and K to positive, and stimulated weight gain. Comparison of P900 (containing cortisol) and C1,800 in three emaciated subjects showed that the latter fluid caused a 2 to 4 times greater degree of positive balance in N, P, K, and Mg than the former. Comparison of P900 (containing cortisol) + 670-1700 cal by mouth with C1,800 in four undernourished subjects showed no statistically significant difference between these two programs."
CD009647,0,11228184,0,Strict volume control normalizes hypertension in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"The aim of this study is to investigate whether normal blood pressure (BP) can be achieved in patients with hypertension on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy by strict volume control without the use of antihypertensive drugs. Of the 78 patients in our center, 47 persons had hypertension and/or were on antihypertensive drug therapy. After discontinuing these drugs, a strong dietary salt restriction was imposed by repeatedly explaining the need for it to patients and families. If this approach did not result in sufficient BP decrease, ultrafiltration (UF) was added by increased use of hypertonic (3.86% glucose) peritoneal dialysis solution. Cardiothoracic index (CTI) on the chest radiograph was also used as a measure of volume control. With salt restriction alone or combined with UF, body weight decreased by a mean of 2.8 +/- 0.5 kg, and BP decreased from a mean of 158.2 +/- 17.0/95.7 +/- 10.3 to 119.7 +/- 16.0/77.9 +/- 9.7 mm Hg in 37 patients, accompanied by a decrease in CTI from 48.0% +/- 5.6% to 42.9% +/- 4.5%. In 19 patients who had residual renal function, 24-hour urine volume decreased to 28% of the pretreatment volume, accompanied by a mean decrease in Kt/V urea from 2.06 +/- 0.5 to 1.85 +/- 0.4. In 7 of the remaining patients who did not respond to the applied treatment, BP decreased from 158.8 +/- 23.2/111.6 +/- 9.8 to 113.5 +/- 14.3/76.4 +/- 6.2 mm Hg after administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Their CTI was 41.2% +/- 1.3%, indicating the absence of hypervolemia. In 3 patients, the desired results could not be reached because of noncompliance. Our findings show that normal BP can be achieved by severe salt restriction combined with increased UF in the majority of CAPD patients. This is accompanied by a decrease in CTI from upper limits into the normal range, but also by a decrease in residual renal function and Kt/V index. In most of the remaining patients, normal BP can be reached by the use of ACE inhibitors."

Nursing assessment of a patient in shock is explored, and the use of tools such as the pulse oximeter is examined. The evidence base for a variety of interprofessional interventions is analysed, including fluid therapies such as blood transfusion, the use of crystalloids and colloids, and drug therapies such as the use of inotropic and vasoactive agents. The nursing role in managing the patient in shock is considered throughout. The importance of recognizing the clinical presentation of shock is highlighted, with an emphasis on understanding the pathophysiology and potential systemic effects. Treatment is discussed and covers: providing optimal oxygen therapy, appropriate patient monitoring and location of care, using effective communication skills, assisting with activities of living, psychological support, and working collaboratively to maximize the overall quality of patient care delivered."
CD009647,0,15012719,0,Preservation of residual renal function and factors affecting its decline in patients on peritoneal dialysis.,"The decline of residual renal function (RRF) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients was analysed and assessed, and risk factors affecting its decline were identified. Residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated from averaging the urea and creatinine clearance by 24-h urine collection, and peritoneal solute removal was evaluated by creatinine clearance calculated from 24-h effluent collection. Both GFR and peritoneal solute removal were chronologically examined in 34 PD patients from the time of initiation, and risk factors associated with rapid GFR decline were investigated. The RRF contributed to 43.1 +/- 17.6% of total (peritoneal and renal) weekly creatinine clearance at 1 month after initiation of PD. Residual GFR, however, declined continuously with time (-0.19 +/- 0.14 mL/min per month), and the reduction rate was high with a higher GFR, higher normalized dietary protein intake, higher urine volume and higher urine protein excretion at the initiation of PD. Other factors related to the rapid decline of GFR were: being older than 60 years of age, automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) rather than continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, mean blood pressure higher than 110 mmHg, and serum human atrial natriuretic peptide level higher being than 60 pg/dL. These data suggest that while RRF plays an important role in the removal of uraemic solute in PD patients, they show a significant decrease over 2 years. The factors related to the rapid decline of GFR corresponded to older age, modality of PD (APD), higher GFR and higher amount of urine protein at initiation, higher dietary protein intake, and inadequate control of hypertension and body fluid volume."

We explored the use of non-invasive measurement of blood pressure (BP) response to Valsalva's maneuver in monitoring hypovolemia in nine healthy elderly volunteers, recruited from participants of the Nijmegen Annual Four-Days Marches. Heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) response (Finapres) to a Valsalva's maneuver as well as clinical and laboratory assessment of fluid balance were determined 5 minutes before, and 3, 5, and 48 hours after administration of 40 mg furosemide orally. Subjects' (4 males aged 74.2 +/- 3.0 years) weight was 66.1 +/- 9.7 kg, mean BP was 139 +/- 21 over 76 +/- 12 mm Hg. A maximum weight loss of -2.8 +/- 0.9% occurred 5 hours after furosemide administration. Systolic and diastolic BP, HR, clinical assessment scores, and serum creatinine and urea nitrogen did not change during the total study period. Significant changes occurred in Valsalva phase I to phase II systolic BP response (difference +14.2 +/- 11.3 mm Hg, ratio difference -0.09 +/- 0.07 after 5 hours, P < 0.01). Changes after 48 hours did not differ from baseline values. Finapres measurement of Valsalva BP response may be useful in monitoring hypovolemia in the elderly."

Eight healthy women (group 1) and nine women with unilateral leg oedema following chronic lymphatic obstruction (group 2) are examined sequentially utilising both methods. 'Equivalent resistivities' of extra- and intracellular fluid (RE and RI) are measured in the leg's upper portion with a multi-frequency impedance meter, and seven CT slices are taken in the same leg segments. In each slice, the ratios of interstitial fluid to subcutaneous tissue and to muscle are calculated using the CT number of plasma for interstitial fluid, and CT numbers of subcutaneous tissue and muscle of group 1 for 'normal' tissues. A decrease in RE and an increase in RI/RE, indicating extracellular fluid increase, are observed in oedematous legs in group 2 when compared with the left legs in group 1. Correspondingly, an increase in the ratios of interstitial fluid to subcutaneous tissue area and to total cross-sectional area is observed in the oedematous legs when compared with those of normal legs in CT analysis. Thus the multi-frequency impedance technique is effective in detecting local oedema in extremities."
CD009647,0,10429321,0,Xerostomia: a prevalent condition in the elderly.,"Although xerostomia is associated with aging, studies have determined that salivary gland function is well preserved in the healthy geriatric population. Therefore, dry mouth is probably not a condition of aging, but most likely one of systemic or extrinsic origin. Saliva seems to undergo chemical changes with aging. As the amount of ptyalin decreases and mucin increases, saliva can become thick and viscous and present problems for the elderly. One of the most prevalent causes of xerostomia is medication. Anticholinergics, such as psychotropic agents and antihistamines, and diuretics can dry the oral mucosa. Chronic mouth breathing, radiation therapy, dehydration, and autoimmune diseases, such as Sjögren's, can also diminish salivation, as can systemic illness such as diabetes mellitus, nephritis, and thyroid dysfunction. Xerostomia can lead to dysgeusia, glossodynia, sialadenitis, cracking and fissuring of the oral mucosa, and halitosis. Oral dryness can affect denture retention, mastication, and swallowing. Dry mouth symptom can be treated with hydration and sialagogues or with artificial saliva substitutes. Because patients are at risk for dental caries, they should be referred to a dentist for preventive care. In patients with Sjögren's syndrome and in those who have undergone radiation therapy, pilocarpine has been used recently with good results."

Practical methods to detect and monitor dehydration are needed. This study determined whether urine color measured by a urine color chart reflects hydration status. The study employed a repeated measures design with two observations during a 10-hour period. Urine color was compared to the criterion standard of urine specific gravity and osmolality. The sample included 89 participants from two Veterans' Affairs facilities. Urine color was graded on an eight-level color chart. Urine specific gravity and osmolality, serum sodium and osmolality, hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine were measured using standard laboratory procedures. Significant positive associations existed between urine color and both urine specific gravity and urine osmolality and between urine osmolality and serum sodium and the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio.

CD009647,0,15181427,1,[The fluid balance in the critically ill patient].,"In the critically ill patient the hemodynamic management is essential. Usually the hemodynamic status is estimated by the measurement of the intravascular pressure or volume and by computing the fluid balance, while the change in body weight estimates the total body water. The fluid balance is computed by subtracting the fluid output to the input. Although the input (fluids, drugs, infusion.) are well known, the output are difficult to correctly compute, because they depend on several factors such as the body-room temperature, amount of humidity and may change with time. Aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of the fluid balance compared to the body weight measured by a dedicated mattress (Hill-Rom)."

The average cardiac index before infusion was 1.8 L/min/m2. Severe sodium and water retention was confirmed by high levels of total body water and extracellular liquid, whereas renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were reduced. Plasma concentration of ANP, norepinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone were significantly increased before infusion. The infusion had no significant hemodynamic effect. After 2 hours urine volume had increased significantly from 51 to 76 ml/hr, urinary concentration of sodium from 72 to 90 mmol/L, and sodium excretion from 4.5 to 8.2 mmol/hr. The infusion was accompanied by a significant increase in plasma ir-ANP from 193 to 980 pg/ml. There were no significant effects on the plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, epinephrine, aldosterone, vasopressin, cortisol, growth hormone, or prolactin and no significant change in plasma renin activity.

CD009647,0,12141471,0,Measurement of extravascular lung water in hemodialysis patients using blood ultrasound velocity and optical density dilution.,"In hemodialysis patients, volume homeostasis is an important clinical problem. The aim is to have patients at an ideal ""dry weight"" postdialysis, but current methods for accurately measuring dry weight are disappointing. Krivitski et al. (ASAIO J 1998;44:M535-M540) have described a novel technique whereby extravascular lung water (EVLW) may be measured using blood ultrasound velocity and electrical impedance dilution. They have tested this method in animals and achieved agreement between obtained versus gravimetric measurements. Isotonic saline is used as a nondiffusible indicator and hypertonic (5%) saline is used as a diffusible indicator. By injecting these solutions and following their transits through the cardiopulmonary circulation, a theoretic basis for the calculation of EVLW may be derived from the cardiac output, the water transferred to blood, the amount of sodium chloride moved from blood to lung, and the increase in blood osmolality measured at the moment of osmotic equilibrium. We have used this new technique to measure EVLW for the first time in humans in 18 stable hemodialysis patients with no cardiac problems. Measurements were carried out twice in each patient, the first early in dialysis, the second toward the end of a dialysis session where fluid removal took place. The values for EVLW were 260+/-49 ml early in dialysis and 230+/-48 ml late in dialysis. This fall of 30+/-45 ml was statistically significant (p = 0.011). EVLW normalized to body weight was 3.29+/-1.0 ml/kg early and 3.02+/-1.04 ml/kg late in dialysis, a nonsignificant difference (p - 0.073). The normalized EVLW values are almost identical to those obtained in animals (3.1+/-1.4 ml/kg) by Krivitski et al. (see above). We conclude that this new technique can conveniently and noninvasively give an estimate of EVLW in hemodialysis patients. The clinical value of this measurement has now to be determined."

The technique was found to produce quantitative agreement with a clinical diagnosis of lymphoedema and with the currently-used measure (limb volume calculated from circumferential measurements) of limb size. The significance of this finding lies in MFBIA being diagnostically informative: it indicates when an observed change in limb volume is directly, albeit theoretically, attributable to accumulation of extracellular fluid.

CD009647,0,7676789,0,Thoracic electrical impedance and fluid balance during aortic surgery.,"Indices of fluid balance were evaluated during and after aortic surgery in 16 consecutive patients. Thoracic electrical impedance (TI), heart rate (HR), central venous (CVP), pulmonary artery mean (PAMP), pulmonary wedge (PWP) and mean arterial (MAP) pressure as well as fourteen arterial and venous blood gas variables were followed. Consistent with a reduction of T1 by 4.2 (-5.2 to 9.2) Ohm (median and range) during the operation, fluid balance was in excess of 1.8 (-0.1 to 3.3) 1 when evaporation was not taken into account, and it remained elevated by 1.3 (0.0 to 5.4) 1 on the first postoperative morning. The HR, MAP and PWP remained stable, while CVP and PAMP decreased by 6 (-2 to 13) and 6 (-1 to 22) mmHg, respectively. Of the determined variables only TI revealed a meaningful correlation to fluid balance (rho = -0.41; P < 0.01). Haemoglobin concentrations increased in proportion to the administered packed erythrocytes, while arterial oxygen saturation, pH and base excess decreased in proportion to the excess fluid. The results indicate that while central venous and pulmonary artery mean pressures gave the impression of a volume deficit, the positive fluid balance was mirrored by thoracic electrical impedance, and that even a minor increase of fluid balance may affect pulmonary function in patients subjected to aortic surgery."
CD009647,0,20866163,0,Results from a mailed promotion of medication reviews among Department of Defense beneficiaries receiving 10 or more chronic medications.,"Like many payers, the Department of Defense (DoD) has limited ability to work directly with prescribers to ensure appropriate medication use. Many older beneficiaries are prescribed multiple maintenance medications, placing them at higher risk for adverse drug interactions, contraindicated medication use, and other polypharmacy-related problems. Medication reviews may mitigate these risks, but the optimal venue for medication therapy management is unclear."

CD009647,0,10569256,0,Leptin levels are suppressed in primary aldosteronism.,"Primary aldosteronism is associated with hypertension secondary to salt and water retention, hypokalemia and impaired insulin secretion with glucose intolerance in some patients. The secretion of leptin, a hormone produced by adipocytes, may be altered by reduced insulin secretion in primary aldosteronism. We measured plasma leptin approximately 3 months before and 3 months after curing of primary aldosteronism in 18 patients (12 male, 6 female, body mass index 29.1+/-4.4, mean +/- SD). Patients were treated by unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy to remove an aldosterone-producing adenoma. There was a 46% postoperative increase in plasma leptin concentrations from 6.65+/-0.81 to 9.68+/-1.50 ng/ml (P=0.004), despite a non-significant fall in body mass index. Plasma leptin was noted to increase after adrenalectomy in 16 of the 18 patients. The patients also had improved blood pressure and a significant increase in plasma potassium post-operatively. It is proposed that increased insulin secretory capacity associated with correction of negative potassium balance may account for the increase in plasma leptin after curing primary aldosteronism. Further studies are indicated to identify the mechanism of plasma leptin suppression in primary aldosteronism."
CD009647,0,2109716,0,[Elemental feeding into the distal segment of a temporary small bowel].,"Patients who have an interruption of the small bowel with a high enterostomy usually need parenteral supply or reinfusion of chyme to maintain nutritional and electrolytic balances before restoring intestinal continuity. Ten patients (aged 28-76 years) with a terminal jejunostomy located within the first meter of jejunum were treated by infusion of an elemental diet into the distal small bowel (IEDDSB). In addition, five of these patients had an extensive small bowel resection. IEDDSB was started 32 days after operation and lasted 4 to 8 weeks. Mean daily caloric infusion was 1,732 +/- 666 kcal diluted in 2,860 +/- 808 ml; mean associated oral intake was 1,187 +/- 480 kcal/24 hr, and jejunal fecal losses averaged 3 kg per day. IEDDSB was well tolerated in 4 patients; 5 experienced transient abdominal pain or diarrhea; 1 developed severe and protracted diarrhea. Biological cholestasis was seen before IEDDSB and persisted in most patients; 1 patient developed biliary sludge. Through IEDDSB, nutritional status improved or remained satisfactory in 9 patients, and worsened in 1 patient with sepsis and a short lower intestine. Mean body weight, triceps skin fold, muscle circumference, serum albumin, serum transferrin did not change significantly. Digestive nitrogen balance performed in 6 patients showed a net absorption between 5 and 15 g/24 hr. Fluid and electrolyte balance was maintained in 9 patients and 1 received iterative intravenous saline. Digestive sodium balance showed a net absorption rate greater than 60 mmol/24 hr. in all patients, except the one who required intravenous supply. Postoperative recovery was uneventful in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,11817535,0,A comparison of several variables of off-pump coronary artery bypass procedures versus myocardial revascularization utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass.,"An investigation was conducted to compare several variables of off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) procedures with those using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for myocardial revascularization by two surgeons. The patients were divided into four groups: group 1 patients received CPB for their myocardial revascularization performed by surgeon A; group 2 patients received the OPCAB procedure performed by surgeon A; group 3 patients received CPB for their myocardial revascularization performed by surgeon B; and group 4 received the OPCAB procedure performed by surgeon B. The same anesthesia technique and postoperative management were employed for all patients in this study. The CPB procedures received the same perfusion circuit and conduct. Postoperative laboratory values, including hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelet counts for the OPCAB groups, were higher than the CPB groups. Chest tube drainage was similar for both the OPCAB and CPB groups, but postoperative urine outputs were significantly higher in the CPB groups for both surgeons. Positive fluid balance was statistically greater in the CPB groups compared to the OPCAB groups for both surgeons. Ventilator times, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and length of hospital stay were not statistically significant for the groups in this study. Postoperative weight gain for both surgeons was higher in the CPB groups. Intraoperative packed red blood cell (PRBC) usage for surgeon B was similar for both the OPCAB and CPB groups, but the OPCAB group for surgeon A had greater intraoperative PRBC usage than the CPB group."
CD009647,0,19475135,0,Imminent cardiac risk assessment via optical intravascular biochemical analysis.,"Heart disease is by far the biggest killer in the United States, and type II diabetes, which affects 8% of the U.S. population, is on the rise. In many cases, the acute coronary syndrome and/or sudden cardiac death occurs without warning. Atherosclerosis has known behavioral, genetic and dietary risk factors. However, our laboratory studies with animal models and human post-mortem tissue using FT-IR microspectroscopy reveal the chemical microstructure within arteries and in the arterial walls themselves. These include spectra obtained from the aortas of ApoE-/- knockout mice on sucrose and normal diets showing lipid deposition in the former case. Also pre-aneurysm chemical images of knockout mouse aorta walls, and spectra of plaque excised from a living human patient are shown for comparison. In keeping with the theme of the SPEC 2008 conference 'Spectroscopic Diagnosis of Disease...' this paper describes the background and potential value of a new catheter-based system to provide in vivo biochemical analysis of plaque in human coronary arteries. We report the following: (1) results of FT-IR microspectroscopy on animal models of vascular disease to illustrate the localized chemical distinctions between pathological and normal tissue, (2) current diagnostic techniques used for risk assessment of patients with potential unstable coronary syndromes, and (3) the advantages and limitations of each of these techniques illustrated with patent care histories, related in the first person, by the physician coauthors. Note that the physician comments clarify the contribution of each diagnostic technique to imminent cardiac risk assessment in a clinical setting, leading to the appreciation of what localized intravascular chemical analysis can contribute as an add-on diagnostic tool. The quality of medical imaging has improved dramatically since the turn of the century. Among clinical non-invasive diagnostic tools, laboratory tests of body fluids, EKG, and physical examination are still the first line of defense. However, with the fidelity of 64-slice CT imaging, this technique has recently become an option when the patient presents with symptoms of reduced arterial flow. Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) treadmill exercise testing is a standard non-invasive test for decreased perfusion of heart muscle, but is time consuming and not suited for emergent evaluation. Once the invasive clinical option of catherization is chosen, this provides the opportunity for intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging. As the probe is pulled through the artery, the diameter at different parts is measurable, and monochrome contrast in the constricted area reveals the presence of tissue with a different ultrasonic response. Also, via an optical catheter with a fiber-optic conductor, the possibly of spectroscopic analysis of arterial walls is now a reality. In this case, the optical transducer is coupled to a near-infrared spectrometer. Revealing the arterial chemical health means that plaque vulnerability and imminent risk could be assessed by the physician. The classical emergency use of catherization involves a contrast agent and dynamic X-ray imaging to locate the constriction, determine its severity, and possibly perform angioplasty, and stent placement."
CD009647,0,3521047,0,[Nephrotoxicity of ionic and nonionic contrast media in selective renovasography].,"Nephrotoxic effect of ionic and non-ionic contrast media was examined in a doubleblind study by evaluation of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urine volume, urinary protein excretion and erythrocyturia before and after selective renovasography. In 19 of 22 patients reliable results were obtained. With optimal hydration before and after renovasography no significant differences between both administered contrast media (Rayvist 300 and Omnipaque 300) could be found by evaluation of the aforementioned parameters. In 3 patients with preexistent proteinuria (greater than 200 mg/l) urine protein excretion remained at the same or a lower level after application of the non-ionic contrast medium Omnipaque 300. Three patients with proteinuria tended to increase the proteinuria after administration of the ionic contrast medium (Rayvist 300) up to 48 h after angiography indicating a higher nephrotoxic potential of ionic contrast media in patients with preexistent renal disease. The constant values of urine volume and serum creatinine indicate an absence of clinically relevant nephrotoxicity of both contrast media in this study when administered in well-hydrated patients. This emphasizes the importance of sufficient hydration in prophylaxis of nephrotoxic effects, especially in patients with risk factors."

CD009647,0,8364831,0,A program for water-intoxicated patients at a state hospital.,"During normal circumstances, individuals have a delicate balance of water requirement and water intake. If the balance of water is altered, electrolyte imbalance can occur. If fluid intake continues uncurbed, an extreme condition may result known as self-induced water intoxication and psychoses. If untreated, complications may develop, including dilated and hypotonic bowel and bladder, hydronephrosis, renal failure, congestive heart failure, mild confusion, acute delirium, seizures, coma, and death. The ongoing problem of water intoxication presents a modern day nursing challenge to psychiatric nurses. The present study monitors nine chronically ill patients in a special program for water intoxication involving control and monitoring and a psychoeducational group approach in a closed unit of a state hospital. At the end of 3 months serum electrolytes, serum osmolality, and urine specific gravity were within normal limits since the start of the program. Anxiety, as evidenced by restlessness, pacing, increased talking, demanding behavior, hyperactivity, yelling, and irritability, had lessened. This improvement was accompanied by a stabilization of psychotic behavior. The use of restraints dropped from 1303 hr in the 3 months before the program to 20 hr and 55 min for the nine patients in the first 3 months of the program. Progress in relation to the study hypothesis will be evaluated every 3 months."
CD009647,0,23229485,0,Effect of combined fluoroquinolone and azole use on QT prolongation in hematology patients.,"QTc prolongation is a risk factor for development of torsades de pointes (TdP). Combination therapy with fluoroquinolones and azoles is used in patients with hematologic malignancies for prophylaxis and treatment of infection. Both drug classes are implicated as risk factors for QTc prolongation. The cumulative effect on and incidence of QTc prolongation for this combination have not been previously described. A retrospective chart review was performed with hospitalized inpatients from 1 September 2008 to 31 January 2010 comparing QTc interval data from electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment at baseline and after the initiation of combination therapy. Ninety-four patients were eligible for inclusion. The majority, 88 patients (93.6%), received quinolone therapy with levofloxacin. Fifty-three patients (56.4%) received voriconazole; 40 (42.6%) received fluconazole. The overall mean QTc change from baseline was 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2 to 11.9) ms. Twenty-one (22.3%) of the studied patients had clinically significant changes in the QTc while receiving combination fluoroquinolone-azole therapy. Statistically significant risk factors for clinically significant changes in QTc were hypokalemia (P = 0.03) and a left-ventricular ejection fraction of <55% (P = 0.02). Low magnesium (P = 0.11), exposure to 2 or more drugs with the potential to prolong the QTc interval (P = 0.17), and female sex (P = 0.21) trended toward significance. Combination therapy with fluoroquinolone and azole antifungals is associated with increased QTc from baseline in hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancies. One in five patients had a clinically significant change in the QTc, warranting close monitoring and risk factor modification to prevent the possibility of further QTc prolongation and risk of TdP."
CD009647,0,16875747,0,Acquired long QT syndrome: risperidone-facilitated triggered activity and Torsades de Pointes during complete AV block. I.,"The acquired Long QT Syndrome (aLQTS) is attributed to subtle defects in genes encoding potassium currents (Ik) that may become clinically significant when associated with other factors that impair ventricular repolarization, such as female gender, bradycardia, hypokalemia or the administration of ion channel blocking drugs. We describe full exposure of an aLQTS in a elderly female patient on long-term Risperidone treatment just when bradycardia due to complete AV block developed. We postulate that the aLQTS induced is the result of a combined block of the rapid (I(Kr))and delayed (I(Ks)) components of the Ik current. The electrocardiographic manifestation of (likely) phase 2 early afterdepolarizations and a critical transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR), both required for the initiation and maintenance of the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with the syndrome (Torsades de Pointes), are as well shown. Risperidone should be used with caution in female patients prone to bradycardia."
CD009647,0,312692,0,High-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue in ovarian cancer: a phase II study.,"Methotrexate (MTX) (1--7.6 g/m2) with leucovorin rescue was given to 19 women with stage III-IV ovarian carcinoma after induction of remission with surgical treatment and chemotherapy or after relapse. Adequate hydration with alkalinization prevented nephrotoxicity and no cumulative myelosuppression was observed. Serum MTX levels in nontoxic patients averaged 1 X 10(-6) M 24 hours following a 30-minute iv infusion of MTX at 3 g/m2. Among nontoxic women there was a 50-fold difference in the MTX level which correlated with the mean serum creatinine level. Response was assessed after 6--12 weeks of treatment by laparoscopy in patients with nonpalpable intra-abdominal tumor implants or by physical examination in patients with palpable masses. Despite the high levels of MTX achieved with the weekly schedule, only one partial response occurred among eight patients with visible or palpable metastatic lesions. Progressive disease was observed after 6--12 weeks of treatment in four of eleven women who began to receive MTX without evidence of disease or with lesions of less than 1.5 cm in diameter. MTX at the dose and schedule used in the present study appears to be of no benefit in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer."

CD009647,0,1860763,0,Renal clearance of an ionic high-osmolar and a nonionic low-osmolar contrast medium.,"One hundred patients with normal serum creatinine concentration underwent intravenous urography with either an ionic high-osmolar (diatrizoate) or a nonionic low-osmolar (iopamidol) contrast medium after randomization. Before injection of the contrast medium, a blood sample was drawn for determinating serum creatinine concentration, and a urine sample for measurement of urine osmolality. Using x-ray fluorescence, the plasma concentration of iodine (contrast medium) was determined on blood samples drawn approximately 3 and 4 hours after injection of the contrast medium. The glomerular filtration rate was calculated by two different formulas: one requiring only a single sample and one requiring at least two samples (standard). There were poor correlations between the standard contrast medium clearance and the serum creatinine concentration, the estimated creatinine clearance (calculated from a nomogram), as well as the urine osmolality. The 3-hour and the 4-hour single-sample values correlated well with the two-sample values for both contrast media. In patients with normal serum creatinine, the glomerular filtration rate determined by measuring the contrast medium concentration in a single plasma sample obtained at 3 hours, is almost identical to the value determined from two samples. Consequently, two samples are unnecessary."

CD009647,0,7400369,0,Effects of amiloride on arterial pressure and renal function.,"Amiloride was administered to 13 male patients with mild essential hypertension and normal renal function. It effectively reduced supine and standing arterial pressures. The antihypertensive response was associated with a significant decrease in renal inulin clearance and a rise in plasma creatinine concentration, although both values at the end of seven weeks of therapy remained within normal limits. Serum potassium concentrations rose but did not reach hyperkalemic levels. Amiloride did not increase blood levels of glucose, uric acid, lipids, calcium, or urea nitrogen. We conclude that amiloride is an effective antihypertensive and antikaliuretic agents for patients with mild hypertension and normal renal function."
CD009647,0,1624155,0,"Oral salt supplements to compensate for jejunostomy losses: comparison of sodium chloride capsules, glucose electrolyte solution, and glucose polymer electrolyte solution.","Six patients with jejunostomies and residual jejunal lengths of 105 to 250 cm took the same food and water each day for eight study days. In random order, three methods of salt replacement were tested, each over 48 hours, against a period without added salt. During the three test periods the patients took 120 mmol of sodium chloride daily, as salt in gelatine capsules, as an isotonic glucose electrolyte (280 mOsmol/kg; 30 kcal) solution, and as a glucose polymer (Maxijul) solution (280 mOsmol/kg; 200 kcal). The daily stomal output remained constant for each patient during the four test periods but varied between patients from 0.60 to 2.84 kg (daily intestinal fluid balance 0.74-2.61 kg). Without a salt supplement, three patients lost more sodium from the stoma than they took in by mouth (-25, -94, and -101 mmol/day) and the mean sodium balance for all six subjects was -16 mmol (range -101 to 79) daily. Extra salt was absorbed with each form of supplement (p less than 0.05); no patient with the glucose electrolyte solution (mean 96, range 0 to 226 mmol), but one patient with the glucose-polymer solution (mean 96, range -25 to 164 mmol) and two with the salt capsules (mean 66, range -8 to 145 mmol) were in negative balance. Two patients vomited with the salt capsules. There was only a small increase in energy absorption (mean 115 kcal) with the glucose polymer solution compared with the glucose electrolyte solution. A sipped glucose electrolyte solution seems to be the optimal mode of sodium replacement in patients with a high output jejunostomy."

CD009647,0,15985299,0,Nocturia and the burning mouth syndrome (BMS) in the elderly.,"The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between BMS and nocturnal micturition in a group of elderly men and women. The study comprised 6103 elderly men and women recruited from a group of pensioners by means of a questionnaire (n=10,216; response rate 61.3%). The mean (+/-S.D.) ages of the men and women were 73.0+/-6.0 years and 72.6+/-6.7 years, respectively. The questionnaire included questions on their health, diseases and symptoms, drugs, sleep habits and the number of nocturnal voiding episodes. BMS was reported by 2.4% of the men and 8.5% of the women (p<0.0001). The occurrence of BMS was unaffected by age in both sexes. In women, but not in men, there was a stepwise increase in BMS in parallel with increased nocturnal micturition. There was a strong relation between nocturnal thirst and drinking on the one hand, and reports on BMS on the other hand. BMS was also increased in diuretics users in both sexes. The results may indicate that negative fluid balance as a consequence of nocturnal polyuria is an overlooked pathogenetic mechanism in the genesis of BMS in the elderly."
CD009647,0,3888808,0,The effect of large volume paracentesis on plasma volume--a cause of hypovolemia?,"Large volume paracentesis, while effectively relieving symptoms in patients with tense ascites, has been generally avoided due to reports of complications attributed to an acute reduction in intravascular volume. Measurements of plasma volume in these subjects have been by indirect methods and have not uniformly confirmed hypovolemia. We have prospectively evaluated 18 patients (20 paracenteses) with tense ascites and peripheral edema due to chronic liver disease undergoing 5 liter paracentesis for relief of symptoms. Plasma volume pre- and postparacentesis was assessed by a 125I-labeled human serum albumin dilution technique as well as by the change in hematocrit and postural blood pressure difference. No significant change in serum sodium, urea nitrogen, hematocrit or postural systolic blood pressure difference was noted at 24 or 48 hr after paracentesis. Serum creatinine at 24 hr after paracentesis was unchanged but a small but statistically significant increase in serum creatinine (+0.1 +/- 0.3 mg per dl, p less than 0.01) was noted at 48 hr postparacentesis. Plasma volume changed -2.7% (n = 6, not statistically significant) during the first 24 hr and -2.8% (n = 12, not statistically significant) during the 0- to 48-hr period. No complications from paracentesis were noted. These results suggest that 5 liter paracentesis for relief of symptoms is safe in patients with tense ascites and peripheral edema from chronic liver disease."
CD009647,0,7562356,0,Treatment of intrabony defects with collagen membrane barriers. Case reports.,"Two separate investigations were undertaken to assess the clinical characteristics and the safety, and to determine whether an absorbable type 1 bovine collagen barrier membrane would result in the improvement of clinical parameters during guided tissue regeneration in humans. The collagen membrane barrier was placed over a total of 21 interdental intrabony periodontal defects in 18 patients. The surgical procedures and postsurgical regimen were similar in both components of the investigation. Sulcular incisions were used and the sites were surgically exposed by reflection of full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps. The intrabony defects were debrided and the root surfaces prepared with automatic scalers and curets. Four 1-minute applications of tetracycline HCl 50 mg/ml were applied to the root surface. The collagen membrane barrier was hydrated in sterile saline until pliable, then trimmed so it covered the osseous defect and extended 2 to 3 mm beyond the defect. In both investigations, the collagen barrier membrane was not sutured, but retained by ""pouching"" or undermining the flap. Healing occurred without complications. There were no untoward or adverse reactions to the material in either phase of the study. In the initial investigation, 13 intrabony defects with probing depths of > or = 5 mm were treated in 9 patients having a mean age of 50.6 years. No controls defects were treated. Soft and hard tissue measurements were taken at the time of initial surgery and at 2, 4, and 6 months. In the second phase, 9 patients were enrolled with a mean age of 49.7 years. They had similar bilateral interdental intrabony defects with probing depths > or = 6 mm. One defect received the collagen membrane barrier, while the other was treated by flap debridement alone. The collagen membrane had undergone modification since the initial investigation, and was more highly cross-linked to retard absorption. After initial therapy, and prior to the surgical procedure, a series of 3 dermal patch tests were used to determine whether the patient would elicit a reaction to the collagen. Venous blood was drawn at baseline, 7 to 10 days, 18 to 21 days and at 8 weeks for analysis by ELISA for comparison of test and control sites relative to baseline. There were no allergic response to the dermal tests, and the ELISA tests indicated no significant differences between test and control sites. An automated probe was used to record soft and hard tissue measurements. These included the probing depths and clinical attachment levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD009647,0,3532788,0,Neurohumoral activation during exercise in congestive heart failure.,"Neurohumoral factors were assessed in 14 subjects with chronic, stable New York Heart Association functional class II or III congestive heart failure and nine comparably aged normal subjects at rest and during moderate (50 W) and strenuous (100 W) upright exercise. Heart failure was associated with elevated plasma renin activity and plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) concentrations at rest. However, plasma renin activity almost doubled (from 4.7 +/- 0.6 to 8.4 +/- 1.1 ng/ml per hour) during strenuous exercise in subjects with heart failure, and changed only minimally in normal control subjects. Plasma ADH concentration did not change during exercise in the presence of heart failure, but rose in normal subjects during strenuous exercise to levels comparable to those of subjects with heart failure. Similar plasma osmolality values were present in both groups. Circulating norepinephrine concentrations were insignificantly elevated by heart failure both at rest and during exercise, and plasma epinephrine concentrations were similar. These findings suggest independent neurohumoral activation during exercise in the presence of congestive heart failure, with predominant activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis."

The administration of nisoldipine led to the following results: 1. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell and heart rate slightly increased after the first dose, but did not show any appreciable change over 4 weeks treatment. 2. The urinary excretion of sodium, fractional excretion of sodium, plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma noradrenaline concentration (pNA) were elevated initially, but the trend was to return to pretreatment levels after 4 weeks treatment. 3. A decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration was observed from the commencement of treatment. 4. Urinary excretion of calcium, fractional excretion of calcium and 24-h urine volume (UV) increased from the beginning, and maintained elevated levels after 4 weeks treatment. A decrease in body weight was also observed. 5. Plasma Ca2+ concentration did not change significantly throughout the treatment period, but PTH was decreased significantly both after 1 week and 4 weeks. 6. The percent changes in MAP (% delta MAP) after 4 weeks showed a significant negative correlation with pretreatment levels of MAP and the increment of UV (delta UV), as well as a positive correlation with pretreatment PRA or pNA levels. These findings suggest that in addition to its direct vasodilative effect, suppression of sympathetic activity and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, reduction in body fluid and sodium, and a decrease in PTH and the related calciuresis may contribute to the hypotensive mechanism of nisoldipine."

Correlations with other efficiency measures [ultrafiltration (UF) and small-solute clearances], prescriptive parameters [duration of treatment, initial intraperitoneal fill volume (IPV) and its tidal percentage, and dialysate flux] and peritoneal transport status were tested in univariate and multivariate linear regression models. Removal of Na was 89 +/- 55 mmol per treatment, which correlated with UF (r = 0.29, p = 0.001) and was higher in patients with high-average transport (118 +/- 41 mmol vs. 81 +/- 56 mmol in low-average transporters, p = 0.0004), in whom a significant positive correlation was found with initial IPV and duration of treatment (r = 0.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.21 to 0.77; p = 0.0029; and r = 0.66; 95% confidence interval: 0.38 to 0.83; p = 0.0002 respectively). Removal of Na correlated weakly with UF in tidal APD and showed wide inter-patient variability. It should therefore be measured rather than roughly estimated from UF. Its magnitude exposes the anuric patient on nightly APD with a ""dry"" day to the risk of Na retention, unless controlled Na intake or dialytic strategies aimed at enhancing Na removal, or both, are implemented."

CD009647,0,10769330,0,Heat waves: their impact on the health of elders.,"A trend toward more hot and humid summers in the United States raises concern for the health of our elderly population. Older adults are more vulnerable to heat illness than younger people because of dysfunctional thermoregulatory mechanisms, chronic dehydration, medications, and diseases involving the systems that regulate body temperature. Heat exhaustion, if untreated, will lead to heat stroke, which is fatal if body temperature is not quickly lowered, and research shows that survivors may suffer long-term disabilities. Prevention requires strong knowledge and application of measures necessary to keep elders healthy in extreme heat. Should illness occur, careful monitoring and assessment will ensure early detection and prompt treatment. This article provides information for caregivers that will enable them to protect their patients from heat illness. It also discusses age-related changes in the thermoregulatory system's response to heat, risk factors, assessment criteria, preventive measures, and first aid for victims of heat exhaustion and heat stroke."

During the operation lasting about an hour the intravenous administration of 400 ml of crystalloid solutions maintains the volumes of fluid sectors within the due values. These solutions injected in greater volumes result in accumulation of the extra- and intracellular fluid. The antiperistaltic purgation of the intestine before the operation reduces the concentration of calcium in blood by 1 mmol/l at an average."

CD009647,0,2365960,0,Comparison of methods for estimating body composition in young and elderly women.,"Estimates of percent body fat and fat-free mass (FFM) were made in healthy young and elderly female subjects using five different methods: bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA); regression equations involving skinfold measurements at two (Durnin and Womersley; SKF-DW) or three (Jackson and Pollack; SKF-JP) sites; the body mass index (BMI); and an equation relating height and weight to total body water (TBW). Three of the five methods indicated that the percent body fat was significantly greater in the elderly age group. Similarly, three methods estimated FFM values that were significantly lower in the elderly group. In the young group the SKF-DW and TBW methods produced percent fat estimates significantly higher than the other three methods. In the elderly group the percent fat estimates were as follows: SKF-DW greater than BIA greater than SKF-JP = TBW greater than BMI. FFM estimates in both age groups were in inverse rank order to the percent fat estimates. In elderly subjects SKF-DW produced results closest to those from BIA, whereas in young subjects SKF-JP provided the best agreement with the BIA procedure."

CD009647,0,2630431,0,[Changes in the biomechanic property of the skin after hemodialysis treatment].,"Skin extensibility in 21 subjects (belonging to two different age groups) undergoing hemodialysis has been investigated. Measurements have been performed on the forearm before and after two hours of dialytic treatment. A significant decrease of skin extensibility (P less than 0.02) has been recorded in the elderly prior to the dialytic procedure; the data is consistent with an increased dermal water content. Water removal during treatment led to normalization of extensometric levels (P less than 0.05). However, improvement of skin extensibility is not directly related to the amount of water withdrawn. The study support the importance of water in determining skin viscoelastic responses; hemodialysis is a useful model to monitor the effects of water on skin biomechanics."

Common sites of involvement include the scalp, elbows, knees, and back. Moisturization of these areas may provide relief by increasing hydration. Accordingly, the use of a moisturizing cream (Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream) was studied in participants with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis (5%-10% body surface area) who either were not being treated or had discontinued the use of all topical psoriasis medications and all other moisturizers and remained off of them for the entire study. The condition of the participants'skin was objectively monitored for skin barrier function through transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration through corneometry, and desquamation through the use of sticky tape corneocyte counts (D-SQUAME). Thirty participants were enrolled. The results of this 4-week study indicate there was no further damage to the skin barrier, as no significant change in TEWL was seen. Furthermore, skin hydration increased over the course of the study. Desquamation measurements showed a significant percentage of participants with skin improvements from very dry to dry or normal (P < .0001 for all time points). All of these effects were noted despite the absence of topical psoriasis treatment. The investigator assessed that this moisturizer was well-tolerated and appropriate for use on the damaged skin of participants with psoriasis."

The drug was well tolerated and side-effects were few. 2. Tested on rat blood vessels, prazosin was ten times more potent on a molar basis than phentolamine in blocking the vasoconstrictor effects of noradrenaline. In the absence of vasoconstrictor nervous activity, no vasodilatation was observed. 3. In genetically hypertensive rats, prazosin in large doses caused a substantial fall in blood pressure, total exchangeable sodium and extracellular fluid volume.

CD009647,0,7069387,0,Diuretic induced hypokalemia in the elderly.,"The effects of four commonly prescribed diuretics on serum potassium were assessed. One hundred sixteen elderly clinic patients, independently living, (mean age 74.3 years, range 60 to 99 years) were taking hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (n = 40; mean daily dose, 53.9 mg), a combination of hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene (HCTZ-TMTR) (n = 38; mean daily dose, 1.28 capsules), furosemide (n = 20; mean daily dose, 38.0 mg), or chlorthalidone (n = 18; mean daily dose, 55.6 mg). Patients did not take more than one diuretic. No patients received potassium supplementation or had diseases affecting potassium balance. The study design was a nonblinded, noncrossover retrospective chart audit with chi-square analysis. All patients were counseled about reducing excessive sodium intake and using potassium-rich foods and salt substitutes, although compliance concerning these dietary factors was not assessed. Even though some comparisons of diuretics showed statistical significance, these differences probably are not clinically significant because all serum potassium values were above 3.0 mEq/L and no patient was symptomatic. This study supports the use of HCTZ as an initial antihypertensive diuretic; it is as efficacious as the other diuretics in this study, is less expensive, and usually does not cause clinically significant hypokalemia more often than do the other diuretics."

CD009647,0,17984418,0,The fate of older diabetic patients on peritoneal dialysis: myths and mysteries and suggestions for further research.,"The outcome of older and especially of female diabetic patients appears to be worse on peritoneal dialysis (PD) than on hemodialysis (HD). This opinion is based mostly on data coming from the USA, whereas data from other regions seem to give a more balanced picture. The questions arise whether indeed outcome is worse in this patient group, and what might be the underlying reasons for this; further research to unravel this phenomenon is warranted. This review proposes several suggestions for further exploration. The observed differences in outcome might be attributable to differences in treatment practices and experience with PD versus HD. As cardiovascular mortality is a major killer in end-stage renal disease patients, differences in fluid homeostasis and how it is achieved are potential explanations. Fluid balance is potentially more difficult to obtain in PD patients, especially as in the past it was spuriously suggested that fluid restriction was less important in PD patients. PD and HD might also have different impacts on factors related to inflammation, insulin resistance, and hormone balance. The adipocytokine network is of special interest in this respect. It is also possible that bias introduced by the way we measure body composition might have a more negative impact on PD than on HD patients. Finally, it still is not fully established that if diabetic patients are treated appropriately, their outcome on PD is worse than that on HD; further observational trials in this respect are needed. All these topics require further clarification and investigation."

Data from an additional 21 patients were evaluated for safety only. The data reported herein represent the preliminary experience from a larger 200-patient multicenter study. All patients received placebo for 4 weeks, followed by either hydrochlorothiazide or diltiazem titrated to achieve a diastolic blood pressure reduction of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg to reach a goal supine diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Patients not achieving the treatment goal received hydrochlorothiazide plus diltiazem. At week 14, on maintenance monotherapy, diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide produced comparable reductions in blood pressure from placebo baseline (160.3 +/- 24.3/101.7 +/- 5.5 to 145.2 +/- 24.1/89.8 +/- 7.4 mm Hg with diltiazem, 156.0 +/- 15.6/103.7 +/- 4.7 to 134.1 +/- 12.5/89.2 +/- 9.5 mm Hg with hydrochlorothiazide, p less than 0.001 for both). Diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide achieved goal blood pressure in 42% and 45% of patients, respectively. The effects in responders were sustained for 6 months. In patients who did not achieve the treatment goal, 63% responded to diltiazem plus hydrochlorothiazide.No clinically significant postural hypotension was observed on any regimen. Heart rate was slightly lower with diltiazem than with hydrochlorothiazide.

CD009647,0,3873461,0,"The effects of low flow, low pressure pulsatile bypass.","The effects of low flow low pressure pulsatile bypass were studied in 90 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. Overall pump flow rate (OFR) was 19-49 (mean 31 +/- 7) ml/kg/min at all temperatures. Moderate (28 degrees C) hypothermia was used. When cross-clamped flow was 17-49 (mean 27 +/- 7) ml/kg/min and mean perfusion pressure 50-60 mmHg. Priming volume (PV) was reduced to 1.45 +/- 0.02 L (range 1.2-2.0 L) PV, cardioplegia and volume additions were considered as total bypass crystalloid (TBC) and this correlated positively with increased post-operative positive water balance (r = 0.58, P less than 0.001). Bypass urine output averaged 135 +/- 24 ml (range 0-1,000 ml) was unrelated to OFR and correlated only with TBC (r=0.47, P less than 0.001). In 86 a single cardioplegia dose of 0.7 L (range 0.4-0.8 L) sufficed for this ischaemic period (mean 46 +/- 16 min). Four required a further 0.2-0.3 L. Their ischemic times were 44-74 min (mean 59 +/- 13 PNS). Inotropes were used in only 3 patients. Post-operatively 7 required diuretics for low hourly urine flow. Of the 76 with normal pre-operative renal function urea rose transiently in 15. Three had raised urea for over 9 days. Creatinine rose transiently in 7 but persisted in only one. Plasma cortisol (n=78) rose in 67 and fell in 11, indicating, overall, an adequate metabolic response.

CD009647,0,9150475,0,Development of a population-specific regression equation to estimate total body water in hemodialysis patients.,"We have previously shown that the impedance index (height corrected resistance) is a valid and reliable correlate of total body water (TBW) in hemodialysis patients. We estimated TBW by single frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in 3009 in-center hemodialysis patients, and developed an ESRD-specific TBW equation from routinely available demographic and anthropometric variables. The mean +/- SD age was 60.5 +/- 15.5 years; 47% were female, 47% African-American, and 36% diabetic. Dialysis duration was 3.8 +/- 3.7 years. Mean TBW was 40.8 +/- 9.3 kg, 56 +/- 9% of body weight. A stepwise linear regression equation was fit on a two-thirds random sample, deriving significant parameter estimates for the variables age, gender, height, weight, diabetic status, weight squared, and the cross-products of age and gender, age and weight, gender and weight, and height and weight. The equation was then validated in the remaining one-third sample, and compared with TBW estimates by the Watson and Hume-Weyer formulae. TBW estimated by our equation (40.6 +/- 8.6 kg) was not significantly different from the BIA TBW (40.5 +/- 9.3 kg). In contrast, TBW estimated by the Watson (37.0 +/- 7.6 kg) and Hume-Weyer (37.9 +/- 7.7 kg) formulae underestimated TBW by a mean of 3.5 and 2.6 kg, respectively. A population-specific equation provides superior prediction of TBW in hemodialysis patients. The use of formulae developed and validated in non-uremic populations may result in underestimates of TBW in patients with ESRD, and potentially, overestimates of dialysis dose approximated by the clearance-time to TBW ratio (Kt/V)."

This study aimed to evaluate the association between micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes and anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies. Forty-six patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were studied. Twenty-one patients had coronary artery disease as a macrovascular complication. Twenty-five age and sex matched healthy subjects formed a control group. Anticardiolipin IgM, IgG, anti-beta2 glycoprotein IgM and IgG antibody levels were studied in both patient and control groups. Diabetic patients with ischaemic heart disease had significantly higher titres of anticardiolipin IgG antibody than patients without ischaemic heart disease (P < 0.001). However, none of these patients had an anticardiolipin IgG antibody level higher than 20 GPL, which is accepted as a clinically significant value, so this association may not be clinically important. There was no association with the microvascular complications. There was also no significant association between anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies in type 2 diabetic patients and micro and macrovascular complications. Anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies do not have a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications in type 2 diabetic patients. Prospective studies of large populations are needed to explore this association further."

Combining benoxaprofen with tolbutamide does not significantly change plasma glucose, insulin, or tolbutamide concentrations. Probenecid, by blocking renal tubular secretion of benoxaprofen, increases the benoxaprofen half-life and decreases its renal clearance and urinary excretion. Excretion rate is halved in patients with severe renal impairment. Hemodialysis inefficiently lowers benoxaprofen plasma concentrations. Neither glomerular nor renal tubular function is affected by benoxaprofen, even after five years of therapy. The incidence in urine of microscopic spheroids (benoxaprofen glucuronide complexes) is related to urinary drug concentration and osmolality; increasing the fluid intake decreases incidence."

The caloric intake was maintained constant during the two 7-day periods of each infusion. The indices measured after each period were total volume of fluid administered, change in body weight, hematocrit, serum sodium, creatinine, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, inorganic phosphate, and cholesterol. The total volume of 10% isocaloric nutrient solution was significantly (p less than .05) greater than that of the 20% solution. A rise in body weight and a fall in serum indices of hydration status were observed; five patients developed clinical signs of overhydration while on the 10% solution. These changes did not occur with the 20% solution. Thus, isocaloric substitution of a 20% fat emulsion for a 10% fat emulsion with TPN prevented overhydration and hemodilution without compromising nutrient intake."

The median age was 59, 61% were Ann Arbor Stage IV, 57% had ""B"" symptoms, 50% had serum lactate dehydrogenase greater than 250 U/L, and 48% had masses greater than 7 cm (33% > 10 cm) in diameter. Seventy-six percent of patients attained complete or probable complete remissions. The Kaplan-Meier actuarial failure-free survival at 7 years is 50%, and 59% (32 of 54) of all patients started on therapy remain alive and in first remission at a median of 62+ (range, 49+ to 76+) months from completion of therapy. Nearly all patients developed severe neutropenia. Febrile episodes requiring hospitalization during neutropenia occurred after 56% of courses of epirubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone and after 9% of courses of cyclophosphamide and cytarabine; 80% of patients were hospitalized at least once. Platelet count nadirs of less than 20,000/microL occurred after only 1 of 146 evaluable courses of epirubicin and after none of the cyclophosphamide/cytarabine courses. Although 8 patients had decreases of at least 0.12 in their left ventricular ejection fractions (5 to below normal levels), none have developed clinically evident congestive heart failure. Clinically significant mucositis occurred after only 8% of courses of high-dose epirubicin. Three deaths from infections and one from hyperkalemia with cardiac arrest occurred during therapy. These results confirm that high remission and sustained, failure-free survival rates can be achieved in patients with aggressive NHL, using high-dose anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens. Epirubicin appears to have an advantage over doxorubicin at high doses because of decreased toxicity at a therapeutically equivalent dose. These phase II study results need to be validated in a randomized phase III trial, and growth factors should be used to attempt to reduce the neutropenia-associated complications."

In group III, V was significantly lower than in groups I and II in the last three 6-h periods, and in group III, Tc water was higher in the first 6-h period than in groups I and II. There was a significant positive correlation between AVP and Sosm in all groups. In conclusion, renal water excretion cannot be reduced as rapidly and to the same degree in renal transplant recipients as in control subjects because of a decreased renal capacity for reabsorption of water. The higher AVP level in the transplant recipients may be a compensatory phenomenon for the decreased responsiveness of the renal collecting ducts in the transplanted kidneys. The sensitivity of the osmoreceptors to changes in osmotic stimuli was normal."
CD009647,0,7408392,0,Effect of prazosin on renal function in congestive heart failure.,"Prazosin improves hemodynamics promptly in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), but tolerance to repeated doses may develop rapidly. To determine if the kidneys play a role in this attenuation of effect, we studied renal responses in nine CHF patients treated with prazosin (5 mg three times a day for 3 days) preceded and followed by 3 days of placebo. Prazosin decreased mean arterial blood pressure from 87.0 +/- 2.2 (mean +/- SEM) to 84.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg (p < 0.05) with no change in heart rate (73.1 +/- 3.3 bpm on placebo and 73.6 +/- 3.5 bpm on prazosin). The change in creatinine clearance from 81.6 +/- 8.7 to 96.3 +/- 10.4 ml/min with prazosin was not statistically significant, but the slight increase in urine volume from 2.33 +/- 0.22 to 2.51 +/- 0.23 1/24 hr was (p < 0.01). There were no significant changes in serum sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2, blood urea nitrogen, osmolality or glucose, urinary excretion of sodium or potassium, or sodium balance. The data were analyzed for changes within each period but there were no significant changes from day to day. Plasma renin activity rose from 3.93 +/- 0.69 to 4.96 +/- 0.84 ng/ml/hr during prazosin (p < 0.02). Significant alterations in renal function are not likely when patients with CHF are treated with prazosin, and any attenuation of effect of prazosin after repeated doses is not likely due to mechanisms involving alterations in renal function."

Because these may be seen as potentially conflicting practices, we set out to determine the influence of fluid management on the outcomes of patients with septic shock complicated by ALI."
CD009647,0,15802214,0,"Life-threatening erythroderma: diagnosing and treating the ""red man"".","Exfoliative erythroderma, or diffuse erythema and scaling of the skin, may be the morphologic presentation of a variety of cutaneous and systemic diseases. Establishing the diagnosis of the underlying disease is often difficult and, not uncommonly, erythroderma is classified as idiopathic. Several cases are presented to demonstrate the diversity of presentation of this disease. Laboratory findings are typically unhelpful in establishing the etiology of erythroderma. Clinical data combined with multiple skin biopsies over time are necessary. Systemic complications of erythroderma include infection, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, thermoregulatory disturbance, high output cardiac failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The initial approach to the management of erythroderma of any etiology includes attention to nutrition, fluid and electrolyte replacement, and the institution of gentle local skin care measures. Oatmeal baths and wet dressings to weeping or crusted sites should be followed by application of bland emollients and low-potency topical corticosteroids. Systemic dermatologic therapy may be required to maintain improvement achieved with local measures or to control erythroderma refractory to local measures. The prognosis of erythroderma is dependent on the underlying etiology."
CD009647,0,4091028,0,"Kidney function in a selected lithium population. A prospective, controlled, lithium-withdrawal study.","Forty-six lithium (Li) patients who had been on Li for about 1-11 years were studied while on Li and after about 3 months (7 weeks-26 months) off Li. Kidney function was compared between patients on Li and the same patients off Li, and, in 32 matched pairs, between patients on and off Li and psychiatric controls. Urine osmolality (U-osmol) was significantly lower, urine volume higher in patients on Li than in controls. Measures of both glomerular and tubular function improved when Li-patients discontinued medication. U-osmol remained somewhat lower than in controls and was negatively correlated with time-on-Li. Although serum creatinine was somewhat higher in Li-patients off Li than in controls, clearance values were not different between the two groups. Long-term lithium treatment causes a permanent reduction of tubular function. Time-on-Li is a risk factor. In this population the reduction was clinically insignificant. In addition, Li treatment causes a reversible reduction of both tubular and glomerular function. The results can probably be generalized to other outpatient Li populations with the same time-on-Li and with U-osmol below 800 mOsm/kg during ongoing treatment."

CD009647,0,3675136,0,Neuroendocrine responses to intravenous tryptophan in major depression.,"The increases in plasma levels of prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) following intravenous administration of the 5-hydroxytryptamine precursor tryptophan (100 mg/kg) were assessed in 30 depressed patients and 30 control subjects. In depressed patients who lost less than 10 lb, PRL responses were significantly reduced compared with controls. In contrast, the PRL responses of patients with weight loss exceeding 10 lb were significantly greater than those of either controls or the other depressed patients. Growth hormone responses to tryptophan were significantly decreased in patients who lost less than 10 lb. Prolactin, but not GH, responses correlated significantly with the postdexamethasone plasma cortisol concentration; however, an apparent relationship between GH and PRL responses and suicidal behavior was probably due to the common factor of weight loss. The results suggest that depressed patients have different types of abnormal 5-hydroxytryptamine-mediated neuroendocrine responses that correlate with the presence or absence of severe weight loss and cortisol hypersecretion. Further investigations are needed to establish if these abnormalities are central to the depressive disorder or have implications for treatment response."
CD009647,0,2321565,0,Skinfold thickness measurements in obese subjects.,"To determine the accuracy of skinfold thickness measurements in body composition assessment, skinfold thicknesses, bioelectrical impedance, body density by underwater weighing, and total body water by deuterium dilution were determined in 105 healthy adults who varied widely in body fatness. Body fat ranged from 2.9% to 61.2% of body weight and a substantial number of obese subjects was included. The correlation between body fat calculated from skinfold equations and body fat measured by underwater weighing was in the same range as that between body fat estimated from impedance and underwater weighing. However, body fat calculated both from skinfold equations and bioelectrical impedance tended to be underestimated compared with body fat calculated from underwater weighing and total body water in the most obese subjects. In obese subjects it was not possible to measure significant numbers of skinfold thicknesses because of the inadequate size of the calipers."

CD009647,0,20736921,0,The safety of osmotically acting cathartics in colonic cleansing.,"Efficient cleansing of the colon before a colonoscopy or a radiological examination is essential. The osmotically acting cathartics (those given the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code A06AD) currently used for this purpose comprise products based on three main substances: sodium phosphate, combinations of polyethylene glycol and electrolyte lavage solutions (PEG-ELS), and magnesium citrate. All these preparations give adequate cleansing results and have similar profiles in terms of the frequency and type of mild to moderate adverse effects. However, serious adverse events, such as severe hyperphosphatemia and irreversible kidney damage owing to acute phosphate nephropathy, have been reported after use of sodium-phosphate-based products. The aim of this Review is to provide an update on the potential safety issues related to the use of osmotically acting cathartics, especially disturbances of renal function and water and electrolyte balance. The available evidence indicates that PEG-ELS-based products are the safest option. Magnesium-citrate-based, hypertonic products should be administered with caution to elderly individuals and patients who are prone to develop disturbances in water and electrolyte balance. Sodium-phosphate-based products can occasionally cause irreversible kidney damage and should not be routinely used in bowel-cleansing procedures."
CD009647,0,12233273,0,Crystalline aggregation in vitro: interaction between urinary macromolecules and the micromolecular environment.,"The formation of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals, their growth and above all their agglomeration tendency are considered to be decisive factors in the renal stone formation. The aim of this study was to verify whether the formation in vitro of crystalline macroaggregates, induced by increasing loads of oxalate, is different in normal subjects as opposed to CaOx stone formers, free from urinary metabolic abnormalities. The possible interference of the urinary micromolecular environment on the activities of macromolecules with molecular weight greater than 10,000 Daltons was also evaluated. Formation of crystalline macroaggregates took place in controls at a relative CaOx supersaturation equivalent to 32.6 +/- 12.9 and in stone formers at 34 +/- 12.3 (NS); the CaOx RS aggregation--CaOx RS nucleation delta was 11.4 +/- 12.2 in controls and 15.8 +/- 13.9 in stone formers (NS). Leaving aside the stone disease variable, the urine characterized by high baseline CaOx saturation, high ionic strength and high levels of citrate, magnesium and calcium, seemed particularly predisposed to macroaggregates formation; the opposite was true for urine characterized by a totally different micromolecular environment. A very close relationship was found between the CaOx RS aggregation--CaOx RS nucleation delta in urine filtered at 0.22 mu and in metastable solutions containing macromolecules in similar concentrations to those found in the native urine (r = 0.74, P < 0.0001). In conclusion the formation of crystalline macroaggregates in vitro does not present differences in normal subjects compared to CaOx stone formers free from urinary metabolic abnormalities. The urinary macromolecules seem to participate in the formation of the crystalline macroaggregates and their action seems to be affected by the urinary micromolecular environment and, even when they are re-suspended in a completely different medium, their action seems to be preserved intact."

CD009647,0,18582254,0,The effect of mannitol on renal function after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with established renal dysfunction.,"The usefulness of mannitol in the priming fluid for cardiopulmonary bypass is uncertain in patients with normal renal function, and has not been studied in patients with established renal dysfunction. We studied 50 patients with serum creatinine between 130 and 250 micromol.l(-1) having cardiac surgery. Patients were randomised to receive mannitol 0.5 g.kg(-1), or an equivalent volume of Hartmann's solution, in the bypass prime. There were no differences between the groups in plasma creatinine or change in creatinine from baseline, urine output, or fluid balance over the first three postoperative days. We conclude that mannitol has no effect on routine measures of renal function during cardiac surgery in patients with established renal dysfunction."
CD009647,0,359019,0,A double-blind comparison of the effects of hydrochlorothiazide and tienylic acid (a diuretic with uricosuric properties) in hypertension.,"1. A double-blind comparison of the effect of tienylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide on blood pressure was made in patients with moderate hypertension. 2. The antihypertensive effect of 500 mg tienylic acid was comparable to 100 mg hydrochlorothiazide; mean decrease in supine blood pressure after 6 weeks treatment was 20/12 mmHg with tienylic acid and 17/9 mmHg with hydrochlorothiazide. Onset of antihypertensive action was within 1 week and was associated with significant weight loss. 3. Tienylic acid caused a marked decrease in serum uric acid to a mean of 0.18 mmol/1 (n = 11, P less than 0.001), this persisted through the treatment period and returned to placebo values 1 week after treatment ceased. Some patients had uric acid crystaluria and some had post-treatment uric acid levels higher than on placebo. 4. Tineylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide caused mild hypokalemia and alkalosis with proportional decrease in plasma chloride. 5. Blood urea and serum creatinine rose with both drugs and there was an unimportant decline in plasma sodium. 6. Tienylic acid is an effective antihypertensive agent with powerful uricosuric action and appears relatively free of side effects. Further studies are necessary to determine optimal dosage regimes and long term safety."
CD009647,0,6398383,0,Plasma volume recovery after ultrafiltration in patients with chronic renal failure.,"We studied the effect of standardized ultrafiltration (UF, 2 liters in 60 min) on plasma volume (PV, 131I-albumin space) and its recovery, with special reference to the tissue hydration before UF. Twenty-one UF sessions were performed in 15 patients with endstage renal failure. The PV reduction, which varied considerably, was maximal at the end of UF (range, -0.7 to -21.9%); after that PV recovered reaching a plateau in the second hour after UF. A highly significant negative correlation was found between the interstitial fluid volume (IVF, calculated from 82Br space-PV) and the PV reduction at this stage (r = -0.89, P less than 0.0001). Despite avoidance of major changes in total extracellular fluid in the next 24 hr, a further restoration of PV took place which was partial in subjects with normal tissue hydration, but complete or even excessive in grossly overfilled subjects. This PV repletion was accompanied by an increase in the intravascular mass of albumin (P less than 0.02). The negative correlation between initial IFV and PV change persisted after 24 hr (r = -0.83, P less than 0.0005). In most occasions the blood pressure fell, but only in eight occasions frank hypotension followed. Heart rate remained remarkably unaltered, even during hypotensive episodes. Changes in plasma renin activity followed no uniform pattern. Our findings indicate that the tissue hydration state has a strong influence on changes in PV during fluid removal and the subsequent repletion of PV."
CD009647,0,16721026,0,A new home based bioimpedance system for PD.,"Fluid overload and uncontrolled hypertension may be considered important mortality risk factors in peritoneal dialysis (PD) population. Even malnutrition is highly prevalent in PD patients. It is now well established that lower levels of serum markers of nutrition such as albumin, creatinine, and prealbumin are associated with increased mortality in PD patients [Fein, P.A. et al: Adv Perit Dial 2002;18:195-199]. Moreover cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease, and hypertension and volume expansion are highly prevalent in long-term PD patients. Many studies in hemodialysis and in PD have demonstrated that phase sensitive bioelectrical impedance analysis is a widely used and proven method for evaluating patient's body composition. The vectorial bioimpedance analysis is a validated system to evaluate the hydration and nutritional state of hemodialysis and PD patients with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the new multifrequency BodyComp bioimpedance analyzer as a home based tool versus traditional Bia Vector."

CD009647,0,629632,0,Contrast media-induced oliguric renal failure.,"Seven patients had acute oliguric renal failure after intravenous urography (2), celiac arteriography (2), or cardiac angiography (3). Diatrizoate meglumine was the contrast media used in all of the cases. These patients had an average age of 63 years and six were 55 years of age or older. Diabetes mellitus, negative fluid balance before the procedure, underlying renal insufficiency, and hypertension were common, being present in three, four, five, and six of the patients respectively . Anuria or oliguria occurred within 24 hours of the procedure and persisted from 36 to 96 hours (72 hours average). The serum creatinine level rose significantly in all of the patients and reached a peak in two to seven days after the procedure. In six patients, recovery was complete by two to three weeks. The seventh patient experienced only partial recovery. These cases taken together with a mounting number of recent reports suggest that contrast media-induced oliguric renal failure is more common than generally believed. Diabetes mellitus, older age, and underlying renal insufficiency seem to be important predisposing factors."
CD009647,0,995828,0,Seizures after the age of sixty.,"Despite adequate diagnostic evaluation and prolonged follow-up, the causes of epilepsy in the elderly patient frequently remain unknown. Some of these may be of occult, degenerative or vascular central nervous system disease origin--entities which are often difficult to incriminate specifically. Unquestionably, in a few cases, seizures occur at the time of the initial cerebrovascular accident, although in some patients seizures may follow such an episode after a latent interval, particularly when cortical motor areas have been damaged by the initial vascular insult. It is important to differentiate this group from those with recurrent vascular episodes, in whom diagnostic studies and treatment may differ. Brain tumour is as prominent a cause of seizures in the seventh decade as it is in younger adults, but probably is of lower incidence thereafter. Focal, clinical and electroencephalographic findings and a progressive clinical course are particularly common in this group. A heterogeneous group of causes, a few of which are liable to affect the ageing patient, are responsible for some of the seizures in old age and should be searched for when the etiology is obscure. Diagnostic studies will vary with the individual problem and, whenever possible, should be restricted to non-invasive studies such as electroencephalography and computer-assisted tomography, after initial baseline clinical assessment and laboratory studies have been performed. Contrast procedures such as angiography are sometimes hazardous to patients with atherosclerosis and should be reserved for selected patients. Treatment follows conventional guidelines with some modifications due to the vulnerability of the ageing patient to degenerative disease and complications of immobilization."
CD009647,0,2985302,0,A case of pituitary dependent Cushing's disease with clinical and biochemical features of the ectopic ACTH syndrome.,"A case of atypical pituitary dependent Cushing's disease is reported. The patient presented with clinical symptoms similar to those of the ectopic ACTH syndrome; notably a marked hypokalaemic alkalosis, widely fluctuating plasma cortisol levels, greatly elevated plasma ACTH levels, and failure to suppress both plasma cortisol and ACTH levels following high dose oral dexamethasone. However, a large aggressive pituitary tumour was detected by skull X-ray and computed tomography. Removal of the pituitary tumour led to full remission of the patient's Cushing's syndrome. Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) related peptides in the plasma and tumour tissue extract of this patient have been characterized by gel-filtration and Concanavalin-A Sepharose affinity chromatography, indicating processing of POMC in a manner more usually associated with ectopic tumours."
CD009647,0,15331305,0,Feeding and hydration issues for older adults with dementia.,"All cultures dictate the need to feed the hungry and create rituals for almost every life passage around the consumption of food and beverage. Yet, in old age and among those who cannot advocate for themselves, mealtime is medicalized and demoted to an insignificant event without dignity or regard for individualized needs. Attention must be paid to not only what people eat, but how they eat, and how they are supported in that process. Kayser-Jones summarized the extensive findings of several ethnographic studies in nursing homes by noting the multi-factorial issues involved in delivering excellent care to all residents, especially those lacking an advocate. Her findings exposed how lack of staff education, inadequate staffing and supervision, disregard for personal and cultural preferences, lack of assessment for comorbid health problems, intake of food and fluids, dysphagia, and oral health problems all contributed to malnutrition and dehydration among the residents studied. This seminal set of studies, along with Dr. Kayser-Jones' testimony in US Congressional hearings directly affected the design of federal regulatory protocols to address malnutrition and dehydration. In an attempt to increase the number of staff available to assist at meals, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid issued a change in regulations on Sept. 26, 2003, allowing reimbursement for staff trained for a total of 8 hours to act as feeding assistants. This change is intended to, ""provide more residents with help in eating and drinking and reduce the incidence of unplanned weight loss and dehydration"". Although seen as answering some of the staffing ratio issues at meal times,this rule change has been criticized for not addressing the complexities of resident needs at meal times. Although offering food and fluid is time-consuming and requires special knowledge of physiological changes and empathy for persons whose behavior might be objectionable at times, it may be one of the few times during the day that the individual with dementia receives normalized social interaction. Thus, as in the care of all vulnerable persons with dementia, whether at home or in an institution, perhaps the greatest challenge and need is for nurses and other caregivers to provide a social environment that promotes individual dignity and comfort."

CD009647,0,22561769,0,Evaluation of transurethral ethanol ablation of prostate for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia.,"Evaluating short-term (03 months) efficacy and safety of transurethral intraprostatic injection of absolute ethanol to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This intervention study was conducted to evaluate 30 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia treated by transurethral injection of dehydrated ethanol. Mean age was 69.96 years. Endoscopic injection of 6-13.5 ml ethanol was carried out at 4-8 sites in the prostate. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), maximum flow rate, prostate volume, postvoid residual and side effects or complications were measured postoperatively. Mean IPSS (SD) improved significantly from 18.43 ± 2.38 preoperatively to 6.80 ± 1.34 at 03 months of follow-up, mean peak urinary flow rate increased from 7.33 ± 1.19 ml/s to 16.31 ± 1.69 ml/s after 3 months, mean residual urine volume had decreased from 54.16 ± 30.93 ml to 17.01 ± 9.59 ml after 3 months (p<0.05). The prostate volume decreased from 44.66 ± 9.52 gm preoperatively to 32.46 ± 7.78 gm after 3 months (statistically significant at 5% level). There were no intra-operative complications but post-operative haematuria occurred in two patients, urinary retention occurred in two patients after removal of the catheter. Urinary tract infection developed in one patient. Transurethral ethanol ablation of prostate appears to be safe and cost effective. No occurrence of retrograde ejaculation was detected. The short-term effects of ethanol injection at prostate were satisfactory and acceptable as a minimally invasive therapeutic modality in selected patients."

The purpose of this investigation was to determine hemorheological alterations in comparison with initial data after treatment with a common diuretic combination. The influence of the therapy on hematocrit, number of leucocytes and thrombocytes as well as fibrinogen-mediated hemorheological parameters was not significant. Statistically significant (p = 0.0215) was the improvement of erythrocyte-fluidity, which indicates a positive influence of the diuretic combination on the erythrocyte membrane. Furthermore a very effective, statistically significant (p less than 0.05) decrease of blood pressure appeared, even down to a normal standard. Discussions on negative effects of diuretic therapy on hemoconcentration hitherto reported in literature are not attempted by this investigation."

All presented with a urine pH of 5. The calculi were located in the proximal ureter in 2 patients and in the renal pelvis in the other 2 patients. After infusion of 1/6 molar lactate, rapid alkalinization of the urine to pH 8 was achieved and maintained. The mean time required for dissolution of the calculi was 6.2 days precluding the need for surgical intervention. The mechanism of action of lactate is oxidative conversion to bicarbonate, providing a sustained alkaline urine. While our patients experienced no metabolic complications, one should monitor serum electrolytes, blood pressure, and fluid balance, particularly in cardiac-compromised patients."

We report the case of an 80-year-old woman who developed, 24 hours after the surgery, a picture of drowsiness and lethargy without neurological focality. The diagnosis of SIADH was suspected. We conclude that is important to have in mind this clinical entity in the differential diagnosis of non-focal neurological deficit after carotid endarterectomy."
CD009647,0,1439651,0,Open-heart surgery in patients requiring chronic hemodialysis.,"The management and outcome of open-heart surgery in 31 patients requiring chronic hemodialysis because of end-stage renal failure are reviewed. The reasons for surgery were coronary artery disease (20 cases), mitral valvulopathy (5, including 3 with tricuspid insufficiency), aortic valvulopathy (5, including 2 with coronary artery disease) and perforation of an aortic aneurysm into the left upper lung lobe. Surgery was elective in all but the last case. Apart from double venous cannulation to avoid potassium overload after cardioplegia, and hemofiltration in the extracorporeal circulation permitting removal of 1,500-2,000 ml fluid during bypass, procedure was routine. Postoperatively fluids were restricted and serum potassium levels were not allowed to exceed the known preoperative maximum. Four patients required catecholamine support for 3-10 hours. Thirty were weaned from the respirator after 8-41 (mean 16) hours. The one perioperative death was due to complications associated with post-bypass administration of protamine. Dialysis was restarted 20-69 (mean 32) hours postoperatively. With appropriate management of fluid balance and potassium, open-heart surgery in dialysis-dependent patients need not carry heightened risk."
CD009647,0,3792183,0,"Nutritional absorption in short bowel syndrome. Evaluation of fluid, calorie, and divalent cation requirements.","Eight patients with a short bowel resulting from intestinal resection and clinically stable for at least one year were studied for 10 days. The diet chosen was lactose-free with a low fiber content and contained 22% of total calories as protein, 32% as carbohydrate, and 46% as fat. Total fluid volume was kept constant, and all patients were in positive nitrogen balance. During the 10-day period, blood chemical concentrations, stool, and/or ostomy volume, urine volume, electrolyte excretion, and calorie and divalent cation absorption were measured. In addition it was determined that fluid restriction during meals did not affect these parameters. In these patients the absorptions of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and total calories were 54%, 61%, 81%, and 62%, respectively. Similarly the absorption of the divalent cations, calcium, magnesium, and zinc, were 32%, 34%, and 15%, respectively. We suggest that patients with short bowel syndrome, who have been stable for at least one year and who can tolerate oral diets, do not need to restrict fat or to separate fluids from solids during their meals. Furthermore, they should increase their oral intake to 35-40 kcal/kg ideal body weight in order to counteract their increased losses. The diet should contain 80-100 g protein/day in order to maintain a positive nitrogen balance and a large margin of safety. In addition, these patients may take oral supplementation of calcium, magnesium, and zinc to maintain divalent cation balance."
CD009647,0,9534323,0,[The influence of ACE inhibitors on urinary electrolyte secretion and the response to transitory hypovolemia in chronic heart failure].,"Renin-angiotensin system promotes sodium and chloride retention, participates in the defense response to hypovolemia and, in congestive heart failure, contributes to edema formation and progression of the disease. We investigated whether ACE-inhibitors interfere with the action of the renin-angiotensin system on the nephron, and therefore with water and urinary electrolytes excretion. The interaction among renin-angiotensin system, diuretic treatment and urinary electrolytes was evaluated both during chronic treatment and in response to acute renin-angiotensin system activation as that observed after extracorporeal ultrafiltration-induced transient hypovolemia. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone, body fluid balance and urinary sodium, chloride and potassium concentrations were evaluated in 30 patients with congestive heart failure in NYHA II-III functional class, grouped according to whether long-term therapy did not include (Group I, n = 15) or included (Group II, n = 18) ACE-inhibitors. All parameters were evaluated at baseline and after a single session of extracorporeal ultrafiltration. At baseline, urinary output and urinary sodium and chloride concentrations were similar in the two groups, while urinary potassium concentration was lower in patients assuming ACE-inhibitors (Group II). Plasma renin activity was higher and aldosterone was lower in Group II than in Group I. After removal of similar amounts of plasma water by extracorporeal ultrafiltration, body weight decreased in both groups but the decrease was maintained in the following days only in Group II patients. A transient reduction (48 hours) of both plasma volume and urinary output was observed after ultrafiltration in both groups. Despite plasma renin activity and aldosterone increase, urinary electrolytes response to ultrafiltration was different in the two groups: sodium and chloride were reduced, and potassium did not change in Group 1 while, in Group II, sodium and chloride did not change and potassium excretion was significantly increased. In conclusion, chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors does not enhance the excretion of sodium in congestive heart failure but just mitigates potassium loss. The role of these drugs becomes particularly relevant during acute renin-angiotensin system activation due to hypovolemia; in this setting ACE-inhibitors counteract sodium and chloride retention resulting in a potential hazard due to interference with the defence mechanisms toward hypovolemia, and an amplification of extracorporeal ultrafiltration efficacy by preventing edema recovery after its mechanical removal."

CD009647,0,8414157,0,Determination of total body water in uraemic patients by bioelectrical impedance.,The measurement of total body water by bioelectrical impedance in a group of renal patients was evaluated against the tritium dilution method. The effect of haemodialysis and the presence of peritoneal dialysate on the impedance were also investigated. The correlation between the two methods is r = 0.90 with a residual standard deviation of 3.7. The standard deviation of the differences between the two methods against the means was 3.66 which means that total body water (TBW) estimated by the bioelectrical impedance (BEI) method may be 6.18 l (X +/- 2 SD) above or 8.38 l below the 3H2O method. The BEI method overestimated the actual weight loss after haemodialysis (3.87 +/- 1.7 l versus 2.43 +/- 1.8 l) but underestimated the volume of peritoneal dialysate in situ. The BEI method would not be appropriate for use in assessing total body water and monitoring acute volume changes in patients with renal failure who are on strict fluid restriction.

This side-effect was not mentioned in the French list of therapeutic drugs until 1992. The diarrhoea was without faeces and without glairy mucus or blood. Symptomatic treatments were totally ineffective. The diarrhoea itself was well tolerated, but 3 patients lost weight, with hypokalaemia in 2 of them, and 1 had regressive acute renal failure. The time elapsed between the first dose of Cyclo 3 fort and the diarrhoea ranged from 1 to 3 months, and it took 5 months to make the aetiological diagnosis. Two patients were hospitalized. Withdrawal of the drug always resulted in cure. One patient taking enemas developed a regressive subocclusion of the bowel. The physiopathological mechanism of this diarrhoea is unknown. These cases are similar to the 5 other cases reported in the literature."

CD009647,0,16402447,0,Position of the American Dietetic Association: Liberalization of the diet prescription improves quality of life for older adults in long-term care.,"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association (ADA) that the quality of life and nutritional status of older residents in long-term care facilities may be enhanced by liberalization of the diet prescription. The Association advocates the use of qualified dietetics professionals to assess and evaluate the need for medical nutrition therapy according to each person's individual medical condition, needs, desires, and rights. In 2003, ADA designated aging as its second ""emerging"" area. Nutrition care in long-term settings must meet two goals: maintenance of health and promotion of quality of life. The Nutrition Care Process includes assessment of nutritional status through development of an individualized nutrition intervention plan. Medical nutrition therapy must balance medical needs and individual desires and maintain quality of life. The recent paradigm shift from restrictive institutions to vibrant communities for older adults requires dietetics professionals to be open-minded when assessing risks vs benefits of therapeutic diets, especially for frail older adults. Food is an essential component of quality of life; an unacceptable or unpalatable diet can lead to poor food and fluid intake, resulting in weight loss and undernutrition and a spiral of negative health effects. Facilities are adopting new attitudes toward providing care. ""Person-centered"" or ""resident-centered care"" involves residents in decisions about schedules, menus, and dining locations. Allowing residents to participate in diet-related decisions can provide nutrient needs, allow alterations contingent on medical conditions, and simultaneously increase the desire to eat and enjoyment of food, thus decreasing the risks of weight loss, undernutrition, and other potential negative effects of poor nutrition and hydration."
CD009647,0,2955161,0,Relationship of plasma concentrations of human atrial natriuretic peptide to renal function and blood pressure in patients with progressive chronic renal failure.,"Recent experimental and clinical findings indicate that immunoreactive human Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (alpha-hANP) is involved in the regulation of blood volume and arterial blood pressure (BP). Whereas the potential regulatory role of alpha-hANP in acute changes of extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) and in the modulation of BP has been demonstrated in various studies, their involvement in the chronic maintenance of sodium and water homeostasis is still equivocal. Moreover the role of alpha-hANP is of particular interest in chronic renal failure, since in this pathological condition increased sodium and water retention plays a major pathogenetic role in the development of hypertension and altered secretion and/or metabolism of alpha-hANP may contribute to fluid volume and BP regulation. To evaluate the relationship between the degree of renal insufficiency, BP and circulating alpha hANP we determined plasma alpha-hANP concentrations in 16 nondialyzed patients with progressive chronic renal failure (CRF) of various degree. Serum creatinine concentrations ranged from 127 to 1187 (435 +/- 76) mumol/l, systolic BP from 135 to 200 (158 +/- 4) and diastolic BP from 80 to 110 (94 +/- 2) mm Hg respectively. Plasma alpha-hANP concentrations ranged from 49 to 753 with a mean of 228 +/- 42 pg/ml which was thus significantly higher as compared to 90.0 +/- 16.2 pg/ml found in healthy volunteers (p less than 0.05). A highly significant linear correlation between plasma alpha-hANP and serum creatinine concentrations (r = 0.92) was observed; a weaker correlation was found between mean arterial pressure and alpha-hANP (r = 0.66) and serum creatinine concentration (r = 0.59), respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The development of stroke units has been a major breakthrough in reducing disability through co-ordinated rehabilitation, and new interest is being focussed towards limiting acute neurological deterioration through acute stroke units. Monitoring and attempting to stabilize acute physiological parameters within normal limits such as blood pressure, temperature, hydration status, glucose levels and oxygen saturations, has become standard practice for some acute stroke units. Strategies to correct hypertension, hypotension, dehydration, hyperglycaemia, pyrexia and hypoxia may potentially reduce neuronal damage in the acute phase of stroke and subsequently improve functional outcome and survival. Whether we require large prospective randomized controlled trials to test whether these specific interventions are to be used in mainstay practice is unclear."

CD009647,0,20610358,0,Electrolytes in the aging.,"The elderly population in the United States continues to grow and is expected to double by 2050. With aging, there are degenerative changes in many organs and the kidney is no exception. After 40 years of age, there is an increase in cortical glomerulosclerosis and a decline in both glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow. These changes may be associated with an inability to excrete a concentrated or a dilute urine, ammonium, sodium, or potassium. Hypernatremia and hyponatremia are the most common electrolyte abnormalities found in the elderly and both are associated with a high mortality. Under normal conditions, the elderly are able to maintain water and electrolyte balance, but this may be jeopardized by an illness, a decline in cognitive ability, and with certain medications. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the potential electrolyte abnormalities in the elderly that can arise under these various conditions to prevent adverse outcomes."
CD009647,0,11863308,0,A new technique for the quantification of peripheral edema with application in both unilateral and bilateral cases.,"Current noninvasive techniques for the routine and frequent quantification of peripheral lymphedema in patients are total limb volume measurement (by water immersion or by circumferential measurements) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). However both of these techniques require standardizing the measurement using a contralateral measurement from the unaffected limb. Hence these techniques are essentially restricted to unilateral lymphedema. This paper describes the results from a preliminary study to investigate an alternative approach to the analysis of the data from multiple frequency BIA to produce an index of lymphedema without the need for normalization to another body segment. Twenty patients receiving surgical treatment for breast cancer were monitored prior to surgery and again after diagnosis with unilateral lymphedema. The data recorded were total limb volume, by circumferential measurements; and BIA measurements of both limbs. From these measurements total limb volumes and extracellular fluid volumes were calculated and expressed as ratios of the affected limb to that of the unaffected limb. An index of the ratio of the extracellular fluid volume to the intracellular fluid volume was determined. This ECW/ICW index was calculated for both the affected and unaffected limbs at both measurement times. Results confirmed that the established techniques of total limb volume and extracellular fluid volume normalized to the unaffected contralateral limb were accurate in the detection of lymphedema (p < 10(-6)). Comparison of the ECW/ICW index from the affected limb after diagnosis with that from the pre-surgery measurement revealed a significant (p < 10(-6)) and considerable (75%) increase. The results of this pilot study suggest that by using multiple frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis, an index of the ECW/ICW ratio can be obtained and this index appears to have an equal, or better, sensitivity than the other techniques in detecting lymphedema. More importantly, this index does not require normalization to another body segment and can be used to detect all types of peripheral edema including both unilateral and bilateral lymphedema."

CD009647,0,18540687,0,Management of acute renal failure in the elderly patient: a clinician's guide.,"Numerous anatomical and functional changes occurring in the aging kidney lead to reduced glomerular filtration rate, lower renal blood flow and impaired renal autoregulation. The elderly are especially vulnerable to the development of renal dysfunction and in this population acute renal failure (ARF) is a common problem. ARF is often iatrogenic and multifactorial; common iatrogenic combinations include pre-existing renal dysfunction and exposure to nephrotoxins such as radiocontrast agents or aminoglycosides, use of NSAIDs in patients with congestive cardiac failure and use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics in patients with underlying atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. The aetiology of ARF is classically grouped into three categories: prerenal, intrinsic and postrenal. Prerenal ARF is the second most common cause of ARF in the elderly, accounting for nearly one-third of all hospitalized cases. Common causes can be grouped into true volume depletion (e.g. decreased fluid intake), decreased effective blood volume (e.g. systemic vasodilation) and haemodynamic (e.g. renal artery stenosis, NSAID use). Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most common cause of intrinsic ARF and is responsible for over 50% of ARF in hospitalized patients, and up to 76% of cases in patients in intensive care units. ATN usually occurs after an acute ischaemic or toxic event. The pathogenesis of ATN involves an interplay of processes that include endothelial injury, microvascular flow disruption, tubular hypoxia, dysfunction and apoptosis, tubular obstruction and trans-tubular back-leak. Vasculitis causing ARF should not be missed as this condition is potentially life threatening. The likelihood of a postrenal cause for ARF increases with age. Benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostatic carcinoma and pelvic malignancies are all important causes. Early identification of ARF secondary to obstruction with renal imaging is essential, and complete or partial renal recovery usually ensues following relief of the obstruction.A comprehensive medical and drug history and physical examination are all invaluable. Particular attention should be paid to the fluid status of the patient (skin turgor, jugular venous pressure, lying and standing blood pressure, urine output). Urinalysis should be performed to detect evidence of proteinuria and haematuria, which will aid diagnosis. Fractional excretion of sodium and urine osmolality may be measured but the widespread use of diuretics in the elderly gives rise to unreliable results. Renal imaging, usually ultrasound scanning, is routinely performed for assessment of renal size and to exclude urinary obstruction. In some cases, renal biopsy is necessary to provide specific diagnostic information. The general principles of managing ARF include treatment of life-threatening features such as shock, respiratory failure, hyperkalaemia, pulmonary oedema, metabolic acidosis and sepsis; stopping and avoiding administration of nephrotoxins; optimization of haemodynamic and fluid status; adjustment of drug dosage appropriate to glomerular filtration rate; early nutritional support; and early referral to nephrologists for diagnosis of ARF cause, timely initiation of dialysis and initiation of specific treatment. The treatment of prerenal and ATN ARF is largely supportive with little evidence of benefit from current pharmacological therapies. Despite advances in critical care medicine and renal replacement therapy, the mortality of ARF has not changed significantly over the last 40 years, with current mortality rates being up to 75%."

Thirteen patients were treated with continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) for renal failure following open heart surgery since April 1999 to December 2001. The indication of CHDF was blood purification in 8 patients and water balance control in 5 patients. Two patients with hemodialysis (HD) before operation returned to usual HD early after operation, and discharged. One patient died of severe heart failure, and another patient died of sepsis and multi organ failure. In these 2 patients, CHDF could not withdrawn. Seven patients weaned from CHDF 1 to 19 days after operation. Five of 7 patients discharged, but 2 patients died of cerebral infarction 4 month after operation. The remaining 2 patients could not wean from CHDF, and were introduced HD. Only 1 of 13 patients had bleeding tendency (cardiac tamponade). CHDF did not influence the hemodynamic state and was very effective for the treatment of renal failure in many patients."

CD009647,0,1534478,0,Hypervolemic therapy prevents volume contraction but not hyponatremia following subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Hyponatremia is common following subarachnoid hemorrhage and has alternatively been attributed to either the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone or natriuresis causing intravascular volume contraction. We prospectively studied body sodium and intravascular volume regulation in 19 patients, beginning within 3 days after acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred, in order to determine the impact of hypervolemic therapy on both hyponatremia and volume contraction and to ascertain whether humoral factors account for hyponatremia. Serial measurements of plasma arginine vasopressin, atrial natriuretic factor, renin activity, aldosterone, and catecholamines were correlated with body sodium and fluid balance, change in blood volume, serum sodium concentration, and osmolality. Six patients (32%) developed hyponatremia, but only 2 had a negative sodium balance. In most patients, levels of atrial natriuretic factor were elevated, while plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were generally suppressed. Plasma arginine vasopressin levels were not suppressed during hypo-osmolality and did not correlate with serum osmolality in hyponatremic patients. Only 1 patient had a decrease in blood volume, which was associated with marked rises in aldosterone and plasma renin activity, but normal serum sodium and plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels. We conclude that following subarachnoid hemorrhage: (1) Hypervolemic therapy prevents volume contraction but not hyponatremia, (2) humoral factors may favor both sodium loss and water retention, and (3) arginine vasopressin regulation is disturbed and may contribute to hyponatremia."

The relevant test parameters involved aspects of word list learning, and concept shifting on a complex speed task. Potentially biasing factors such as anxiety, disturbed sleep, education and age could be discarded. With respect to the physiological mechanism involved, the results suggest that a relatively expanded extracellular volume without dilutional hyponatremia might underlie the diminished performance. The experimental group did not lose weight overnight, and the hemoglobin and haematocrit level of the experimental group were significantly different from those of the control group; the blood pressure, plasma electrolytes and osmolality were not different. The present results provide evidence that disturbances in fluid homeostasis may affect cognitive performance."

CD009647,0,15292031,0,Attenuation of vasopressin-induced antidiuresis in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.,"Renal resistance to vasopressin has been demonstrated in type 1 diabetes and in type 2 diabetes with nephropathy. However, renal response to vasopressin in type 2 diabetes without nephropathy has not been studied. We studied 10 subjects with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (PCDS; Hb A(1c) >9%), 10 subjects with well-controlled type 2 diabetes (WCDS; Hb A(1c) <7%), and 10 matched nondiabetic control subjects (NDCS) during a euglycemic 8-h water deprivation test. None of the subjects had nephropathy. Water deprivation caused similar rises in plasma vasopressin concentrations in all three groups, but the rise in urine osmolality in PCDS (280.3 +/- 49.7 to 594.4 +/- 88.5 mosmol/kgH(2)O) was lower than in WCDS (360.7 +/- 142.8 to 794.1 +/- 77.3 mosmol/kgH(2)O, P < 0.001) or NDCS (336.0 +/- 123.3 to 786.5 +/- 63.3 mosmol/kgH(2)O, P = 0.019). Total urine output was higher in the PCDS than in WCDS and NDCS (P < 0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that, in PCDS, the osmotic thresholds for thirst (291.9 +/- 4.6 mosmol/kgH(2)O) and vasopressin release (291.1 +/- 2.9 mosmol/kgH(2)O) were higher compared with WCDS (286.6 +/- 1.8 and 286.0 +/- 3.6 mosmol/kgH(2)O, respectively) and NDCS (286.0 +/- 2.4 and 284.1 +/- 4.7 mosmol/kgH(2)O, respectively) (between groups P < 0.001 for both variables). Under conditions of euglycemia, PCDS have impaired renal response to vasopressin and elevated osmotic threshold for thirst and vasopressin release in response to dehydration. Under conditions of chronic hyperglycemia, these abnormalities may significantly contribute to the development of dehydration in PCDS."

CD009647,0,12074531,0,Evaluation and treatment of heat-related illnesses.,"The body's ability to regulate core temperature depends on both host (internal) and environmental (external) factors. Although athletes are commonly thought to be most at risk for heat illnesses, children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. Heat cramps, which are caused by fluid and electrolyte imbalances, are treated with massage, and fluid and electrolyte replacement. Heat exhaustion occurs both as water- and sodium-depleted types, with associated symptoms such as malaise, vomiting, and confusion. Treatment involves taking the affected person to a cool environment and replacing fluids and electrolytes if needed. In more serious cases, intravenous hydration may be necessary, although monitoring of serum sodium levels is important to prevent cerebral edema. If not treated promptly, heat exhaustion may evolve into heatstroke, a deadly form of heat illness. Heatstroke occurs in classic and exertional forms and is present when the core body temperature exceeds 40 degrees C (104 degrees F). The patient may experience cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, serum chemistry abnormalities, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death. Heatstroke is a medical emergency that should be treated immediately with temperature-lowering techniques such as immersion in an ice bath or evaporative cooling. Fluid resuscitation is important but should be closely monitored, and renal function may need to be protected with mannitol and diuretics. It is important to be vigilant for heat illnesses because they occur insidiously but progress rapidly."
CD009647,0,14618426,0,Predicting the intracellular water compartment using artificial neural network analysis.,"Artificial neural networks (ANN) are used for a wide variety of data-processing applications such as predicting medical outcomes and classifying clinical data and patients. We investigated the applicability of an ANN for estimating the intracellular water compartment for a population of 104 healthy Italians ranging in age from 19 to 68 years. Anthropometric variables, bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) variables, and reference values for intracellular water, measured using whole-body (40)K counting (ICW(K40)), were measured for all study participants. The anthropometric variables and the impedance index (height(2)/resistance) were fed to the ANN input layer, which produced as output the estimated values for intracellular water (ICW(ANN)). We also estimated intracellular water using a BIA formula for the same population (ICW(DeLorenzo)) and another for Caucasians (ICW(Gudivaka)). Errors in the estimations generated by ANN and the BIA equations were calculated as the root mean square error (RMSE). The mean (+/-SD) reference value (ICWK40) was 25.01+/-4.50 l, whereas the mean estimated value was 15.20+/-1.79 l (RMSE=11.06 l) when calculated using ICW(DeLorenzo), 18.07+/-1.14 l (RMSE=8.72 l) when using ICW(Gudivaka), and 25.01+/-2.74 l (RMSE=3.22 l) when using ICW(ANN). Based on these results, we deduce that the ANN algorithm is a more accurate predictor for reference ICW(K40) than BIA equations."

We found that IBMX produced a dose-dependent decrease in tear film osmolarity that was significant at 3.0 mmol/L (P less than .0005) in patients with dry-eye disease. This effect was not blocked by prior administration of proparacaine hydrochloride (P less than .05). Throughout a 4-week, open-label, vehicle-controlled study, IBMX decreased tear film osmolarity significantly, whereas vehicle alone did not. After 4 weeks, mean (+/- SEM) osmolarity in IBMX-treated eyes decreased from 325 +/- 3.2 mOsm/L to 312 +/- 1.8 mOsm/L but remained unchanged in vehicle-treated eyes (323 +/- 4.4 mOsm/L vs 320 +/- 4.2 mOsm/L). In our study, IBMX was significantly more effective than vehicle alone in decreasing rose bengal staining (P less than .02).

The commonest symptoms were cough, loss of weight and appetite, fever and general malaise. Headache, when present, was highly specific for meningeal involvement. Pyrexia, hepatomegaly, evidence of weight loss and adventitious chest sounds were the commonest physical signs. Hyponatraemia, hypo-albuminaemia and abnormal liver function were common. Severe haematological abnormalities were not present in any of the patients. The best diagnostic sources were sputum, bronchial brushings and biopsies of liver and bone marrow. Forty patients (64%) died, 31 deaths being directly attributable to disseminated tuberculosis. Twenty-five patients had associated diseases. More female patients and Black patients died than did males, Whites or Coloureds (mixed race). The duration of symptoms prior to admission was, in general, long in comparison with the interval between admission and death.

CD009647,0,2773616,0,Uremic pruritus. Clinical and experimental studies.,"The aim of the study was to investigate clinical aspects of pruritus in maintenance hemodialysis patients and to evaluate factors of putative pathogenic importance. 60-65% of the patients in a maintenance hemodialysis program during a two-year period suffered from itching. Patients with pruritus tended to have been on dialysis treatment longer than those without pruritus (p = 0.05), otherwise there was no difference in clinical data or routine laboratory tests. Measurement of itch intensity continuously over one week in 28 patients using a computerized method showed that itching peaked at night after two days without dialysis, was relatively high during treatment and lowest during the day following dialysis. Our results suggest that the accumulation of pruritogens between dialysis sessions influences the intensity of itching. Most patients had ""dry"" skin. Recording of the stratum corneum water content by measurement of electrical capacitance, in 31 patients (19 with pruritus) and 12 controls, disclosed no significant difference between dialysis patients and controls, but a tendency that pruritic patients had a lower water content than the other subjects. In different body areas, there was a positive correlation in all groups between the clinical estimation of xerosis and hydration. Serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) were significantly higher in dialysis patients with pruritus than in those without, but there was no correlation between the degree of symptoms and the PTH level. Indirect immunohistochemistry revealed no immunoreactivity for different parts of the PTH molecule in skin biopsies from uremic patients. Intradermal injections of PTH fragments did not evoke itching or other cutaneous reactions in patients or controls. Our results do not support PTH as a peripheral mediator of uremic itching. Flare reactions induced by intradermal histamine injections were significantly smaller in 26 dialysis patients (18 with pruritus) than in 9 healthy subjects. However, the itch responses were greater in patients with pruritus than in the other subjects, indicating an augmented sensitivity to pruritogens. Repeated histamine injections induced tachyphylaxis in both uremic patients and controls. Indirect immunohistochemistry revealed neuron-specific enolase (NSE) immunoreactive nerve fibers sprouting throughout the layers of the epidermis in 12 dialysis patients (9 with pruritus) but in none of 15 controls. This finding suggests that hemodialysis patients develop an abnormal pattern of cutaneous innervation."

CD009647,0,7514953,0,Assessment of urinary beta-core fragment of human chorionic gonadotropin as a new tumor marker of lung cancer.,"Some patients with lung cancer have been found to have elevated levels of serum immunoreactive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)/hCG beta (IR-beta), but it is uncertain whether it would be valuable as a tumor marker. Recently, IR-beta has been demonstrated to consist of at least three different molecules, intact hCG, free hCG beta, and hCG beta-core fragment (beta-CF), in body fluids. In this study, the authors qualitatively analyzed IR-beta in the serum and urine of patients with lung cancer and assessed its clinical usefulness as a tumor marker."
CD009647,0,17221146,0,Efficacy prediction of cevimeline in patients with Sjögren's syndrome.,"The objective of this study was to examine the clinical and immunological factors influencing the efficacy of cevimeline hydrochloride hydrate (cevimeline) for the treatment of xerostomia in patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Thirty primary SS patients who were medicated with cevimeline were enrolled in this study. Whole stimulated sialometry (WSS) was compared between pre- and posttreatment points (4 weeks after oral cevimeline administration) and the increment rate of WSS was calculated. Multiple regression was employed to examine the relative contributions of the clinical and immunological factors, including age, pretreatment WSS, duration of disease, sialography, minor salivary gland biopsy, anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies, anti-La/SS-B antibodies, and antibodies to muscarinic type 3 receptors to the posttreatment WSS. Patients with normal sialography findings, negative minor salivary gland biopsy, and absence of anti-La/SS-B antibodies had significantly higher increment rates of WSS compared with those with positive findings (p=0.042, 0.002, and 0.018, respectively). Results of the multiple regression analysis showed that sialography (coefficient=-0.867, p=0.004) and minor salivary gland biopsy (coefficient=-0.869, p=0.003) had significant associations with the posttreatment WSS. Our preliminary results demonstrated the relationship between the effect of cevimeline on saliva secretion and the degree of salivary gland destruction evaluated by sialography and histopathological findings in the labial minor salivary glands. These diagnostic approaches could provide useful prognostic information on the efficacy of cevimeline in SS patients."

CD009647,0,7734016,0,"Clinical significance of heparin in the residual pump oxygenator blood, reinfused postoperatively after cardiopulmonary bypass.",Postcardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) heparin levels and thrombin time were measured in 20 patients following routine open cardiac operations. There was a statistically significant increase in heparin concentration and thrombin time ratio on completion of transfusion of the residual pump oxygenator blood. An hour after the end of the transfusion there was no statistically significant difference in the heparin concentration and thrombin time ratio compared to values before and immediately after transfusion. We also observed a significant decrease in the chest drainage over a period of four hours which was unrelated to plasma heparin level. Measurements of thrombin time in the post bypass period closely follow plasma heparin levels. If postoperative bleeding arose it was due to inadequate surgical haemostasis or coagulation defect other than residual heparinization. Thus this confirms further that heparin is not the sole aetiological factor in postoperative bleeding post-CPB.

CD009647,0,1192692,0,Body weight and body water in chronic cor pulmonale.,"1. Body weight was measured through forty consecutive illnesses in seventeen patients with oedema in association with chronic bronchitis and hypoxia. All patients were taking diuretic drugs at the time. 2. Body weight increased little as peripheral oedema and a raised jugular venous pressure appeared. The subsequent weight-loss during treatment was usually greater than the pre-treatment weight-gain. Body weight increased slowly in convalescence to equal or exceed hospital admission weight without a deterioration of general health or reappearance of oedema. 3. Total body water, exchangeable sodium and exchangeable potassium were measured in patients after treatment of the acute illness and clearance of oedema and again in six patients of the group 2-3 months later in convalescence. Total exchangeable sodium was normal or slightly reduced after treatment of oedema and in convalescence between recurrent acute illnesses. Even when gross oedema was present exchangeable sodium was substantially increased in only one of three patients studied at this stage. Total exchangeable potassium was invariably severely depressed. 4. Large changes of body tissue weight without comparable change in exchangeable sodium support previous evidence that oedema in hypoxic bronchitis is not simply a further form of congestive cardiac failure. 5. It is suggested that at least some of the tissue loss in acute exacerbations is a direct result of hypoxaemia and similar to that observed at high altitude. Part of the oedema fluid is thought to be derived from intracellular water released during dissolution of tissue matrix."
CD009647,0,3576157,0,[Hemofiltration for the reduction of lung fluid in ARDS?].,"Hemofiltration has been advocated for reduction of extravascular lung water (EVLW) in both clinical and experimental ARDS. The influence of hemofiltration on EVLW was studied retrospectively in 10 patients with this syndrome. After 2 to 38 hours' hemofiltration net fluid balance was -3640 +/- 3609 ml. EVLW remained almost unchanged (from 17.6 +/- 5.4 before to 15.6 +/- 4.1 ml/kg after hemofiltration). In 4 patients a reduction of over 15% in EVLW was achieved, whereas in the remaining 6 patients EVLW changed within a range of +/- 10%. However, hemofiltration caused a decrease in cardiac output and oxygen delivery, thereby adversely affecting its benefits on EVLW and gas exchange. In ARDS hemofiltration should be performed under careful hemodynamic monitoring and only in some of the patients an immediate reduction in EVLW can be achieved."

In correspondence to these findings, the concentrations of the PC-degradation product lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) in cancer patients were found to be decreased. Our objective was the systematic investigation of the relationship between LPC and inflammatory and nutritional parameters in cancer patients. Therefore, plasma LPC concentrations were assessed in 59 cancer patients and related to nutritional and inflammatory parameters. To determine LPC in blood plasma we developed and validated a HPTLC method."

CD009647,0,22770562,0,Angiopoietin-2 is a potential mediator of endothelial barrier dysfunction following cardiopulmonary bypass.,"Endothelial activation leading to vascular barrier dysfunction and organ failure is a well-recognized complication of cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The endothelial-specific angiopoietin-Tie2 ligand-receptor system has been identified as a non-redundant regulator of endothelial activation. Binding of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) to the Tie2 receptor antagonizes Tie2 signaling and renders the endothelial barrier responsive to pro-inflammatory cytokines. We aimed to study the time course and potential triggering factors of Ang-2 release after CPB, as well as the association of Ang-2 changes with surrogates of increased vascular permeability, organ dysfunction, and outcome."
CD009647,0,2597631,0,Stratum corneum hydration and amino acid content in xerotic skin.,"The relationship between clinical severity, the hydration state of the skin surface as assessed by a conductance with a 3.5 MHz high frequency impedance meter, and the amino acid content of the stratum corneum (SC) of six patients with ichthyosis vulgaris and 30 elderly persons with varying degrees of xerosis was investigated. With an increase in the severity of xerosis the SC showed a decrease in hydration and in its extractable amino acid content. There was a significant correlation between the hydration state and amino acid content of the SC. Although there was a significant correlation between the amino acid content of the lower leg SC and that of the forearm SC in the same subject, the former was generally lower, corresponding to the greater incidence of xerosis on the lower leg. These results suggest that a decreased amount of amino acids may be the result of low profilaggrin biosynthesis in the epidermis and that this is involved in the pathogenesis of these xerotic skin conditions. Clinical improvement of the xerosis following treatment with a urea-containing cream was not accompanied by any significant change in the amino acid content of the SC."
CD009647,0,5576038,0,Body water and electrolyte composition in acute renal failure.,"Body water and electrolyte contents have been measured by means of muscle biopsy analysis in 11 patients with untreated acute renal failure and in one patient during the diuretic recovery phase of his illness. Patients with acute oliguric renal failure show two main types of imbalance. One group shows evidence of a reduction in extracellular sodium and chloride with normal intracellular water and electrolytes. These findings are thought to be due to a combination of excess urinary salt loss during the development of oliguric renal failure, and inadequate replacement of extrarenal electrolyte losses. A second group shows overhydration of both extra- and intracellular phases, associated with an excess of sodium and chloride. The intracellular potassium concentration is reduced, owing to the intracellular water excess. The patient studied during the diuretic recovery phase of acute renal failure showed a marked loss of sodium and chloride, which emphasizes the necessity to replace urinary electrolyte losses at this stage of the illness. It is often extremely difficult to assess fluid and electrolyte balance in patients presenting with acute renal failure, and muscle biopsy analysis or isotope dilution studies may be required before accurate replacement therapy is possible."
CD009647,0,12455775,0,Predicting the outcome of renal replacement therapy in severe acute renal failure.,"Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), such as continuous venovenous hemofiltration, has theoretical advantages over intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) that are related to cardiorespiratory stability, metabolic control, and fluid balance allowing nutritional supplementation. However, retrospective and controlled studies fail to show these advantages because of comorbidity associated with triage to CRRT. To compare outcomes using IHD versus CRRT, we applied published risk stratification models (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Lohr index, and APACHE II) to the 349 patients with acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy at University of Michigan over the 2 year period including 1995 and 1996. The Cleveland Clinic Foundation model best predicted overall mortality, but our CRRT patients had excess, unpredicted mortality that was particularly prominent in the lower risk categories. The Lohr clinical score predicted mortality less accurately but also was associated with higher, unpredicted mortality at lower risk scores among the CRRT patients. APACHE II scores did not predict mortality very well among IHD, CRRT, or the combined group of patients. We conclude that the need for CRRT itself predicts mortality over and above that included in published risk models. Either CRRT is associated with some unidentified morbidity (e.g., treatment associated infection) or, more likely, triage to CRRT is associated with as yet unspecified comorbidity not detected in existing risk stratification schemes. It will be important to address these issues in any future studies evaluating outcome or comparing renal replacement therapy modalities among patients with severe acute renal failure."

We presented the first 4 reported cases of acute poisoning from ingesting blasticidin S for suicidal attempts. Three of the patients were fatal. The symptoms observed in the patients included vomiting immediately after ingestion and severe, persistent, watery diarrhea. The toxic effects of blasticidin S were noted in ectodermal tissues including the skin, conjunctiva, cornea, and intestine. Massive loss of intestinal fluid resulted in progressively pronounced hypotension associated with tachycardia. The treatment of choice for the poisoning consists of intravenous fluid administration and the management of body water and electrolyte balance."
CD009647,0,7377572,0,Urinary antidiuretic hormone excretion during mechanical ventilation and weaning in man.,"The authors measured antidiuretic hormone (ADH) excretion and renal and cardiovascular function in eight patients with flail chest during four ventilatory conditions: continuous positive-pressure ventilation (CPPV), intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), spontaneous breathing with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and spontaneous breathing (SB). Each condition was maintained for six to eight days. ADH excretion was significantly greater during CPPV (181 +/- 14 ng/24 h, mean +/- SE) than during IPPV (86 +/- 10), CPAP (181 +/- 14 ng/24 h, mean +/- 6). Free-water clearance was more negative during mechanical ventilation than during CPAP and SB, resulting in significant fluid retention during CPPV and IPPV (440 +/- 88 and 547 +/- 70 ml/day) and a negative water balance during SB (-154 +/- 80 ml/day). Arterial and central venous pressures and cardiac output (measured in four patients) did not change significantly among ventilatory conditions. It is concluded that ADH excretion is increased during CPPV, and this could represent one possible mechanism of water retention with this type of ventilation."

CD009647,0,3240217,0,Estimation of body fluid volumes using tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance measurements.,"Mathematical equations using tetrapolar bioelectrical resistive (R) and reactive (Xc) impedance measures were developed and crossvalidated to predict total body water (TBW) and corrected bromide space (CBS) in two independent samples (n = 110). Height2 per low R was the best predictor of TBW (R = 0.96) and CBS (R = 0.92). When the influence of TBW was removed from CBS and dependent variables, height2 per low Xc was the best predictor (R = 0.50) of CBS. Double crossvalidation of each sample showed that observed and predicted TBW (R = 0.978 and 9.986) and CBS (0.937 and 0.907) were significantly related (p less than 0.001), and there was no difference (p greater than 0.05) between the values. The lines representing the relationships between observed and predicted values had regression coefficients not different than the line of identity. Data from both samples were combined to give a representative multiple regression equation to predict TBW and CBS. This study establishes the validity of the tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance method to assess body fluid volumes in humans."
CD009647,0,7443778,0,Renal function and biopsy in patients on lithium-therapy.,"The renal function of 46 outpatients from a lithium-clinic was examined in detail during 5 days of hospitalization on a nephrological ward. Lithium medication was stopped seven days before admission. In approximately 25% of the examined patients, a lithium-induced nephropathia must be assumed. Irreversibility of the disturbances cannot be excluded. The characteristic feature of this patient population is to be seen in an exclusive reduction of the renal concentrating ability. Urine osmolality showed a significant negative correlation to the product of duration of treatment times lithium serum concentration. In all patients with a reduced GFR a preexisting kidney disease could be demonstrated. The degree of polyuria was not related to the observed impairment of renal function. On the average it took seven years until a reduced concentration ability became apparent; the minimal time interval was three years. The lithium-associated nephropathy may be characterized as a rather frequently occurring damage of the kidney interstitium being dependent on serum-lithium concentration and duration of treatment. Progress of these pathological changes is obviously very slow and accompanied by only few and mild clinical symptoms. Kidney biopsy in 4 cases revealed focal fibrosis and tubular degeneration as has been described by other authors."

However, estimating glomerular filtration rate is challenging due to fluctuations in kidney function, creatinine production and fluid balance. We hypothesized that commonly used glomerular filtration rate prediction equations overestimate kidney function in patients with acute kidney injury and that improved estimates could be obtained by methods incorporating changes in creatinine generation and fluid balance."
CD009647,0,1992534,0,Megestrol acetate in cancer cachexia.,"This randomized, controlled trial assessed the activity, tolerance, and degree of weight gain and anorexia of two doses of megestrol acetate in patients with advanced cancer and cachexia. Patients received either 480 mg/d or 960 mg/d megestrol acetate or placebo for 8 weeks. As of June 1990, 55 patients had been randomized; 16 died during the 8-week study, and it was too early to evaluate another 5 patients. The remaining 34 patients were included in analyses. The median initial weight loss ranged from 15% to 22% of usual body weight, which shows the severe degree of malnutrition. Further weight loss was seen in 6 of 8 patients in the placebo group compared with only 5 of 15 and 3 of 11 patients in the low-dose and high-dose megestrol acetate groups, respectively. The median further weight loss was comparable in all groups. Six of 15 and 6 of 11 patients in the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively, gained weight with a median of 3 kg and 4 kg, respectively. A trend showed beneficial effects of megestrol acetate. Appetite improvement was similar in all groups. Due to the small sample size, however, there were no statistically significant differences among the three groups. Side effects of megestrol acetate were mild. In a subgroup of 15 patients, measurement of body water content indicated a decrease of body fat after 8 weeks in the placebo and low-dose groups. Only the high-dose megestrol acetate group showed an increase in both fat and lean body mass, suggesting a positive effect."

CD009647,0,22116463,0,Clinical characteristics of healthcare-associated pneumonia in a public hospital in a metropolitan area of Japan.,"Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is a new category that is essential in the present aging society. Knowing the different characteristics and outcomes between patients with HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) would help physicians manage and treat HCAP patients. Although HCAP is thought to be heterogeneous in regions, there are no reports from a metropolitan area in Japan. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical findings of all consecutive pneumonia patients who required hospitalized care in our hospital between April 2006 and March 2010. There were 184 (35.0%) patients with HCAP and 342 (65.0%) patients with CAP. Previous hospitalization within 90 days of the infection was the most common criterion for HCAP (63.0%). HCAP patients were significantly older than CAP patients (82.5 vs. 70.0 years, P < 0.001). The percentage of patients with poor functional status was higher in HCAP than CAP (64.0% vs. 26.6%, P < 0.001). Hospital mortality was significantly higher in HCAP patients than in CAP patients (15.8% vs. 5.0%, P < 0.001). Low levels of serum albumin (odds ratio, 0.126; 95% CI, 0.025-0.640; P = 0.012) and high scores in the ADROP (age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation, and blood pressure) system (odds ratio, 2.846; 95% CI, 1.449-5.587; P = 0.002) were the risk factors for HCAP mortality. In conclusion, patients with HCAP have different epidemiological characteristics compared with those with CAP in a metropolitan area of Japan. Outcomes and risk factors for mortality of patients with HCAP included poor nutritional status and high severity scores on the pneumonia severity scoring system."

The patients were randomly divided over two groups. The patients of group B (n = 13) were optimally hydrated before the operation. The Starling curve was used as standard. Patients of group A (n = 13) served as control. The pre-operative and postoperative renal functions of both groups were compared, as were the haemodynamic parameters. The haemodynamic parameters were measured at five minutes intervals during the entire procedure. During aortic clamping the heart rate was significantly lower in patients of group B, indicating a lower myocardial oxygen consumption. Neither the haemodynamic parameters nor the renal function showed other beneficial effects on optimal hydration."

CD009647,0,3383235,0,Hemodynamic and electrocardiographic consequences of high- and low-osmolality contrast agents for left ventricular angiography.,"The cardiovascular effects of two nonionic contrast agents with low osmolality (iohexol and metrizamide) were compared with one standard ionic, high-osmolality contrast agent (metrizoate) used for left ventricular (LV) angiography in patients with coronary heart disease. Metrizoate induced a marked elevation of LV end-diastolic pressure and LV systolic pressure and an increase in cardiac output after a delay of a few minutes. All these changes were significantly less severe with iohexol and metrizamide. Hypotension occurring 30 sec after LV angiography was observed only with use of metrizoate. All agents increased heart rate, but the increase after metrizoate was significantly more pronounced and prolonged. The PQ and QT interval was prolonged only by metrizoate. The subjective symptoms were significantly more marked with metrizoate than with the two other agents. Thus the new nonionic contrast agent iohexol and metrizamide produced markedly less hemodynamic and electrocardiographic disturbance than the ionic agent metrizoate."
CD009647,0,22803968,0,Clinical evaluation of new generation oxygenators with integrated arterial line filters for cardiopulmonary bypass.,"New generation oxygenators with integrated arterial line filters have been marketed to improve the efficacy of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Differences in designs, materials, coating surfaces, pore size of arterial filter, and static prime exist between the oxygenators. Despite abundant preclinical data, literature lacks clinical studies. From September 2010 to March 2011, 80 consecutive patients were randomized to CPB using Terumo Capiox FX25 (40 patients, Group-T) or Sorin Synthesis (40 patients, Group-S) oxygenators. Pressure drop and gas exchange efficacy were registered during CPB. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), white blood cells (WBCs), fluid balance, activated clotting time, international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, platelets (PLTs), serum albumin, and total proteins were measured perioperatively at different timepoints. Clinical outcome was recorded. Repeated measure analysis of variance and nonparametric statistics assessed between-groups and during time differences. The two groups showed similar baseline and intraoperative variables. No differences were recorded in pressure drop and gas exchange (group-P and group*time-P = N.S. for all) during CPB. Despite similar fluid balance (P = N.S. for static/dynamic priming and ΔVolume administered intraoperatively), Group-T showed higher hs-CRP (group-P = 0.034), aPTT (group-P = 0.0001), and INR (group-P= 0.05), with lower serum albumin (group-P = 0.014), total proteins (group-P = 0.0001), fibrinogen (group-P = 0.041), and PLTs (group-P = 0.021). Group-T also showed higher postoperative bleeding (group-P = 0.009) and need for transfusions (P = 0.008 for packed red cells and P = 0.0001 for fresh frozen plasma and total transfused volumes). However, clinical outcome was comparable (P = N.S. for all clinical endpoints). Both oxygenators proved effective and resulted in comparable clinical outcomes. However, Sorin Synthesis seems to reduce inflammation and better preserve the coagulative cascade and serum proteins, resulting in lower transfusions and post-CPB inflammatory response."

CD009647,0,6829756,0,Indexes of body cell mass: nitrogen versus potassium.,"In vivo neutron activation has provided investigators with a powerful tool for research on body composition. Total-body nitrogen (TBN), total-body potassium (TBK), and total-body water (TBW) were measured in 133 normal subjects. TBN, measured by neutron activation, is a measure of total-body protein, an index of body cell mass. TBK, also measured by a nuclear reaction, is an index of body cell mass as well as lean body mass. The mass and protein content of two compartments, muscle and nonmuscle lean tissue, were determined from the combined TBN-TBK data by compartmental analysis. In this study, nitrogen was separated into the actively metabolizing body cell mass component and the slowly metabolizing structural component. The TBK, which is 95% intracellular, was found to be more closely related to the actively metabolizing nitrogen than to TBN. The relationship of body cell mass, a concept originally proposed by Moore, to lean body mass, is shown through the relationship of TBN and TBK. The clinical significance of this study, is that TBK is the more sensitive and reliable indicator of changes in body cell mass. Maximum information on body composition, however, is obtained by the measurement of both TBK and TBN."
CD009647,0,2693619,0,"Cardiovascular, biochemical and hormonal changes during food-induced hypotension in chronic autonomic failure.","The cardiovascular, biochemical and hormonal responses to a standard test meal have been investigated in patients with chronic autonomic failure and normal subjects. In autonomic failure there was a rapid (within 15 min), substantial and prolonged fall in blood pressure after the meal. A marked fall in blood pressure also occurred after a liquid meal of similar composition and caloric content, with no change in blood pressure in age-matched subjects with normal autonomic function. In autonomic failure after the test meal the blood pressure reached its nadir (45% fall) after 60 min, and had not returned to pre-meal levels after 3 h. There were no changes in cutaneous and forearm blood flow. In the normal subjects there were no changes in blood pressure after the meal; forearm blood flow fell and cardiac output increased. In autonomic failure there were no changes in plasma noradrenaline levels, unlike the normal subjects. Plasma adrenaline levels were unchanged in both groups. There was a similar rise in levels of plasma renin activity in both groups. The haematocrit and plasma osmolality did not change in either group. Changes in plasma glucose and plasma insulin levels were similar in both groups. The responses of 3 pancreatic gut peptides, neurotensin, pancreatic polypeptide and enteroglucagon, were greater in autonomic failure. Basal levels and responses of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, cholecystokinin-8 and somatostatin were similar in both groups. The motilin response was greater in normal subjects. We conclude that in patients with autonomic failure there was a rapid, substantial and prolonged fall in blood pressure after a meal. This reduction in blood pressure was not counteracted by an increase in sympathetic nervous activity and other compensatory changes, as occur normally. It was unlikely that osmotic effects of the meal or gut secretions resulted in a significant loss of intravascular fluid into the gut. The fall in blood pressure probably results from vasodilatation within the splanchnic circulation, to which pancreatic and gastrointestinal hormones with vasodilatory actions may contribute."

CD009647,0,2502736,0,The use of an amino-acid-based CAPD fluid over 12 weeks.,"Eight patients with end-stage renal failure (plasma albumin less than 35 g/l) who were established on glucose CAPD exchanges, were studied for 4-week periods before, and after 12 weeks when 1% amino-acid solution had been used for the morning exchange. Anthropometric, biochemical, clinical and dietary assessments were made every 4 weeks. Dietary intakes of protein and calories were maintained. Studies with amino-acid solutions showed a mean of 13% and 8% amino acids remaining in the dialysate after 6 and 8 h respectively. Plasma amino acids increased to a maximum after 2 h of dialysis; however, fasting concentrations were constant over the 5 months. Osmolality of amino acids decreased comparably with 1.36% glucose during 8-h exchanges although the recovery of fluid was marginally less. Plasma transferrin increased significantly after 8 weeks of amino acids but subsequently decreased in one patient due to infection. No significant changes occurred in albumin, apolipoprotein A, IgG, IgA or prealbumin. Cholesterol and apolipoprotein B decreased in seven patients but increased in one due to rising calorie intake. Increases in urea and decreases in bicarbonate were not clinically significant. Amino-acid-based fluid was well tolerated with modest nutritional benefit and reduction in hyperlipidaemia. Optimal effects of amino acids are likely at higher concentrations using two or more exchanges in patients eating less than 0.9 g protein/kg per day."
CD009647,0,2661128,0,Alcohol effects in the elderly.,"Alcohol is a potent drug and must be included in the medication history of the patient. The physician must be alert to the possibility of alcohol abuse by the elderly, in whom typical clues may not be present. Alcohol has a greater dose-related effect in elderly persons because of their decreased total body water, which leads to persistently higher blood alcohol levels. Alcohol causes unique kinds of brain damage, a fact that may aggravate the clinical symptoms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease, but there is no convincing proof of premature aging because of alcohol abuse. Alcohol potentiates the sedating effects of many drugs acting on the CNS. This is especially serious in elderly patients, and they should be cautioned concerning the use of alcohol and drugs."
CD009647,0,12454226,0,No early respiratory benefit with CVVHDF in patients with acute renal failure and acute lung injury.,"There is debate as to whether, in patients with acute lung injury, continuous renal replacement therapy has beneficial effects on pulmonary gas exchange by mechanisms other than fluid removal. Because continuous renal replacement therapy is associated with potential morbidity and mortality, it seems unethical to perform a randomized trial in patients with acute lung injury without renal failure. Therefore, the effects of continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration with zero volume balance on gas exchange were evaluated in patients with acute renal failure and acute lung injury. Because haemofilter conditions should be comparable between patients, we opted for an evaluation of the effects during a 24-h period. Results of this trial can guide future studies in non-renal patients with acute lung injury."

Furosemide does not produce the same result].,"In moderate congestive heart failure pulmonary overhydration may be detected at chest X-ray even if therapy is optimized to keep the urinary output normal and to prevent weight gain and dependent edema formation. Removal of overhydration of the lung may help to define its significance. This study was aimed at investigating whether a subclinical accumulation of fluid in the lung interstitium in moderate congestive heart failure interferes with the patient's functional capacity, and whether furosemide is able to promote reabsorption of the excessive fluid. Patients whose digoxin, oral furosemide and ACE-inhibitor therapeutic regimen was kept constant, were randomly allocated to ultrafiltration (8 cases) or iv bolus (mean dose = 248 mg) of supplemental furosemide (8 cases). The amount of body fluid removed with each method approximated 1.600 ml. Functional performance was assessed with cardiopulmonary exercise tests. Soon after fluid withdrawal with either procedure the filling pressures of the two ventricles and body weight were reduced and plasma renin activity, norepinephrine and aldosterone were augmented. After furosemide hormones remained elevated in the subsequent 4 days, and, during this period, patients had positive water metabolism, recovery of the elevated ventricular filling pressures, recurrence of lung congestion without any improvement in functional capacity. In ultrafiltrated patients, renin, norepinephrine and aldosterone fell below control values within the first 48 hours and water metabolism was equilibrated at a new set point (less fluid intake and diuresis without weight gain). Functional capacity in these patients was improved through favorable circulatory and ventilatory adjustments consequent on reabsorption of lung water. This may also have restored the ability of the lung to clear norepinephrine, thus restraining its facilitation of renin release. Improvement persisted at 3 months after the procedure. In congestive heart failure the set point of fluid balance is altered despite oral furosemide; supplemental iv furosemide does not shift the set point, at least in the presence of ACE-inhibition; excessive, although silent, lung water limits the functional capacity of the patient."
CD009647,0,11591359,0,Safety profile of perindopril.,"Approximately 25% of US adults have high blood pressure (BP). Selection of effective and safe antihypertensive therapy for these individuals is an important health-care priority. High BP can be treated with a wide range of antihypertensive agents from a number of different classes. These drugs may differ in their suitability for administration to different subpopulations of patients. Results from both clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance indicate that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril erbumine is safe and well tolerated in a wide range of patients with hypertension. Cough, the most common ACE inhibitor-associated side effect, is also the most common clinical adverse event reported for perindopril, but <2% of perindopril-treated patients discontinue therapy because of cough. Other adverse events often associated with ACE inhibitors, first-dose hypotension and hyperkalemia, appear to occur less often with perindopril than with other agents in this class. The favorable safety profile for perindopril extends to a wide range of patients, including the elderly and those with either heart failure or renal disease. Perindopril has no negative effects on lipids in patients with hyperlipidemia or on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it reduces proteinuria in patients with renal disease. Perindopril has no known clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Thus, perindopril is a safe BP-lowering agent with documented tolerability in a wide range of patients with hypertension."

A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted to examine and compare properties of intact skin on the buttocks and subumbilicus area in elderly people wearing absorbent products and to identify pad environment factors that affect skin properties. Study participants included 45 elderly (age range: 68 to 103 years) female residents of one nursing home who were incontinent of feces and urine (dual incontinence group--DIG, n = 35) or feces only (fecal incontinence group--FIG, n= 10). Skin pH and hydration were measured and factors believed to affect the perineal environment and contribute to the development of IAD were assessed. In both DIG and FIG, skin hydration levels and pH were higher in the coccygeal than in the subumbilical area. Skin hydration of the sacral region in the DIG was significantly higher than in the FIG (P = 0.019) and skin pH on the coccygeal region and sacral region in the DIG was significantly higher than in the FIG (coccygeal region, P = 0.013; sacral region, P = 0.023). Absorbent pad surface pH (P &0.01) and excessive sweating (P = 0.006) were significantly related to skin pH. Results show that properties of perineal skin in elderly women with incontinence are affected by occlusion with pads, increasing the risk of IAD. Studies comparing the effect of various types of pads and pad-change frequencies on skin properties are needed."
CD009647,0,969479,0,[Urine specific gravity and osmolarity in hypertension patients with dehydration].,Results are reported from the comparative investigations of kidney concentration function by urine specific gravity and its osmolatity of 58 patients with arterial hypertension. Significant differences were found in more of the half of the patients. On the base of certain theoretical prerequisites and possibilities of technical errors was concluded that the determination of the maximal urine osmolality is a more reliable and more accurate index for the actual renal concentration ability. Urine specific gravity can be used in the everyday clinical practice due to the more convenient and easier determination. Urine osmolality must be used predominantly in scientific-clinical studies.
CD009647,0,8403686,0,[A case of paraneoplastic autonomic and sensorimotor neuropathy with dysfunction in the afferent limb of baroreflex arc].,"A 65-year-old man visited our hospital with complaints of tingling sensation in the distal parts of his extremities and dysuria, which first appeared 2 months before admission. He had no abnormal findings on physical examination. Neurological examination revealed sensory impairment of glove and stocking type, mild motor weakness and muscular atrophy in the proximal parts of arms and legs, and absent tendon reflexes in knees and ankles. Fasciculation was observed on his shoulders and upper extremities, and myokymia on the abdominal wall and bilateral calves. He had hyponatremia, which was proved to be caused by SIADH. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody, anti-GM1 ganglioside antibody and anti-galactocerebroside antibody were detected in the serum. Chest X-ray showed mass shadows in the mediastinum, which were confirmed as malignant thymoma by needle biopsy. Orthostatic hypotension, neurogenic bladder and anhidrosis were observed by the autonomic function tests. Lesions responsible for orthostatic hypotension and SIADH were suspected in the afferent fibers from baroreceptors, since an reactive increase of plasma arginine vasopressin to orthostatic hypotension was blunted and reflex hypertension in the cold pressor test was well-preserved, while overshoot in Valsalva's maneuver was absent. It is important that afferent baroreceptor dysfunction may be associated with paraneoplastic neurological syndrome, since lesions in acute autonomic neuropathy are usually in the efferent fibers."
CD009647,0,17993772,0,Ectopic ACTH syndrome caused by pheochromocytoma: computed tomography-guided percutaneous ethanol injection as an alternative treatment.,"Ectopic ACTH secretion represents 8-18% of the cases of endogenous hypercortisolism. Pheochromocytomas correspond to 2-25% of the cases and surgery is the indicated treatment. We describe a case of ACTH-secreting pheochromocytoma treated with percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) guided by computed tomography (CT). A 71-yr-old man presented with diabetes, severe hypokalemia, weight loss, muscle weakness, and hypertension. Hormonal evaluation revealed elevated levels of urinary cortisol, ACTH, catecholamines, and urinary metanephrines. There was no cortisol or ACTH response to desmopressin stimulation test. Magnetic resonance revealed bilateral adrenal nodules, larger on the left side. The suspected diagnosis was ectopic ACTH syndrome caused by pheochromocytoma. Ketoconazole treatment resulted in reduction of urinary cortisol levels but was followed by severe cholestasis and hepatic dysfunction, preventing surgery; it was substituted by octreotide with reduction of ACTH and cortisol levels, but without improvement of cholestasis. The patient presented cachexia and developed multiple pulmonary abscesses that also prevented surgical treatment, thus he was treated with percutaneous ethanol injection guided by CT of the left adrenal tumor. During the procedure, the patient had an increase in blood pressure controlled by the infusion of sodium nitroprusside followed by hypotension that required infusion of dopamine and volume expansion. Afterwards, he presented hormonal normalization, normal catecholamines levels, and clinical improvement. Histological tissue analysis confirmed pheochromocytoma. We concluded that CT-guided PEI represents an efficient alternative therapy to ectopic ACTH-secreting pheochromocytomas in patients without clinical conditions for surgery."

Clinical parameters checked were pre- and postoperative changes of P/F ratio, fluid balance and postoperative epidural analgesia in the two groups. The steroid group had significantly more optimal P/F ratio postoperatively. Fluid balance was significantly more favorable, and postoperative period was significantly less painful in the steroid group. We assumed that steroid had prevented enhancement of vascular permeability and also had suppressed secretion of inflammatory mediators. We conclude that preoperative administration of steroid is beneficial for the perioperative management of patients undergoing extensive surgery."

Neurological examination revealed moderate proximal muscle weakness and loss of tendon reflexes in all extremities. The blood sodium level was 106 mEq/l on admission. The blood level of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin and aldsterone was 11.3 pg/ml (normal value 0.3-4.2), 0.2 ng/ml/h (0.2-2.7) and less than 10.0 pg/ml (38.9-307.0), respectively. The plasma osmolarity was 221 mOsm/kg (270-295), and the urine osmolarity was 416 mOsm/kg (50-1400). EMG and nerve conduction studies suggested acute demyelination in the motor and sensory nerves. CSF revealed 10 cells/mm3 and elevated protein to 98 mg/dl. The clinical course, laboratory data and electrophysiological findings suggested coexistence of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) from the very early clinical stage of the diseases. The clinical and laboratory findings improved after intravenous administration of saline over three weeks. When GBS is associated with SIADH, hyponatremia is commonly seen at the peak of motor paralysis, often accompanied by autonomic or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. This was not the case in the present patient. It is postulated that SIADH, like GBS, might be caused by an autoimmune mechanism."
CD009647,0,19913946,0,[Oropharyngeal dysphagia and aspiration].,"Oropharyngeal dysphagia, or inability to swallow liquids and/or solids, is one of the less well known geriatric syndromes, despite its enormous impact on functional ability, quality of life and health in affected individuals. The origin of oropharyngeal dysphagia can be structural or functional. Patients with neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular diseases and the frail elderly are the most vulnerable. The complications of oropharyngeal dysphagia are malnutrition, dehydration and aspiration, all of which are serious and provoke high morbidity and mortality. Oropharyngeal aspiration causes frequent respiratory infections and aspiration pneumonias. Antibiotic therapy must cover the usual microorganisms of the oropharyngeal flora. Oropharyngeal dysphagia should be identified early in risk groups through the use of screening methods involving clinical examination of swallowing and diagnostic confirmation methods.

Five patients had pure aortic stenosis, 4 aortic insufficiency and 3 had combined lesions. Cardiac output at rest, which was within normal limits before operation, was unchanged on the first postoperative day, but showed a tendency to increase on the two following days. Heart rate was markedly increased postoperatively with a corresponding decrease in stroke volume. Arteriovenous oxygen difference was slightly higher postoperatively, indicating a more hypokinetic circulation after surgery. Right atrial mean pressure, which was normal preoperatively, increased in average 3 mmHg postoperatively, whereas left atrial mean pressure, which was pathologically elevated in most patients before operation, showed a marked decrease after operation with a corresponding decrease in pulmonary artery pressure. No significant change in radial artery pressure was observed. Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance did not change significantly after surgery. The causes of tachycardia, decreased left atrial pressure and hypokinetic circulation after operation are discussed. It is suggested that, in spite of a positive fluid and blood balance, a relative hypovolaemia exists with insufficient blood volume in the left atrium, leading to diminished filling of the low-compliant left ventricle."

CD009647,0,6802937,0,Osmotic and osmotic-loop diuresis in brain surgery. Effects on plasma and CSF electrolytes and ion excretion.,"In 22 patients to be operated on for brain tumors or cerebral aneurysms, the effect of osmotic diuresis was compared with that of osmotic-loop diuresis on plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) electrolytes, and water and ion excretion. Mannitol or mannitol plus furosemide were used to reduce brain bulk. After treatment with thiopental and hyperventilation, patients received randomly a rapid infusion of mannitol (1.4 gm/kg), or mannitol (1.4 gm/kg) plus furosemide (0.3 mg/kg). Brain shrinkage was considerably greater and more consistent with mannitol plus furosemide than with mannitol alone. However, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and hyperosmolality were also more marked (p less than 0.05) with mannitol plus furosemide than with mannitol. The rate of water and ion excretion was even more striking. At 30 minutes after absorption of mannitol alone, water excretion peaked at 17 ml/min, and gradually decreased to 3.8 ml/min 70 minutes later. With mannitol plus furosemide, during an identical time course, initial water excretion was 30 ml/min, followed by a further rise to 42 ml/min and then a decline to 17 ml/min. At peak diuresis after mannitol, Na+ and Cl- excretion average 0.57 and 0.62 mEq/min, respectively. This compares with mean values of 3.7 and 4.12 mEq/min for Na+ and Cl-, respectively, after mannitol plus furosemide. Although optimum brain shrinkage is achieved with osmotic-loop diuresis, the rapid electrolyte depletion (Na+ and Cl-) must be corrected to avoid altered sensorium during the patients' postoperative course."

Respiration was managed with assisted ventilation using laryngeal mask airway and muscle relaxation was obtained with suxamethonium chloride given intermittently. After the operation, he did not seem to have COPD because of the relation between arterial PCO2 and bicarbonate in the perioperative period. Therefore, after obtaining informed consent from this patient, we determined the relation between arterial and spinal fluid acid-base balance under acetazolamide administration. He was more sensitive to central respiratory response because his respiration increased following the decrease of spinal fluid bicarbonate. We further examined and diagnosed him as Eaton-Lambert syndrome by evoked electromyography and by Ca2+ channel antibody."

Twenty-two days after initiation of therapy, the patient developed hyponatremia. The patient also had depressed serum osmolality and elevated urine sodium concentrations consistent with SIADH. With the discontinuation of imipramine, fluid restriction, and several doses of furosemide, normal serum sodium concentrations were attained. As antidepressant therapy was indicated, doxepin was selected. The patient maintained normal electrolyte values and water balance over the next two months of follow-up.

The cardiac output (CO), left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide levels (ANP) were measured during the perioperative period till the 3rd day. Subjects were divided into 2 groups by preoperative PVR values, those over 100 dynes.sec.cm-5 (PVR group), and those less than 100 dynes.sec.cm-5 (N group). Significant correlations were observed between ANP and CO (r = -0.63, P = 0.028), PVR (r = 0.66, P = 0.018), LVSWI (r = -0.71, P = 0.0009) and SVR (r = 0.71, P = 0.009) at 3 hours after operation.

Moreover, the patients indicating high PVR values preoperatively showed significantly higher PVR values than those seen in the N group during the postoperative days. Postoperative complications were significantly seen in the PVR group. Primary water and sodium balance tended to be the higher accumulation in the PVR group than those of the N group, and the cardiovascular parameters in the PVR group revealed hypodynamic characteristics in the early period after the operation. With these results, it is suggested that perioperative fluid therapy and respiratory management should be performed more strictly in the PVR group."

Despite the activation of inflammatory mediators, the infusion of cardioplegic solution into the systemic circulation may result in decreased systemic vascular resistance and thus may cause HCF.

CD009647,0,22257240,0,GreenLight HPS™ 120-W laser vaporization vs transurethral resection of the prostate (<60 mL): a 2-year randomized double-blind prospective urodynamic investigation.,"What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Photovaporization of the prostate (PVP) is now challenging TURP as the standard treatment for lower LUTS caused by BPH. The learning curve for PVP is short and the main advantages of this method over TURP are a shorter period of hospitalization, a shorter period of postoperative vesical catheterization, lower levels of retrograde ejaculation, rare development of dilutional hyponatraemia syndrome, the lack of a need for postoperative vesical irrigation as a result of extremely low indices of postoperative haematuria, and the lack of a need to suspend anticoagulant medication for the surgery. Traditionally, comparisons of the effectiveness of TURP vs PVP have involved parameters such as peak flow urinary rate and post-void residual urine volume measurements, and have employed questionnaires such as the IPSS and the International Index of Erectile Function instruments. However, studies evaluating detailed urodynamic parameters remain scarce and non-comparative The present study compared postoperative, medium-term urodynamic parameters among patients receiving TURP and high-power PVP. We consider the present study to be distinctive because it involved a double-blind, detailed functional analysis of the vesical emptying stage over the course of 2 years, and did not simply comprise an evaluation of clinical parameters and uroflowmetrics. We saw a reduction of infravesical obstruction, as shown by the significant reduction of ≥20 cm H(2)O in the mean micturition pressure for the groups studied, as well as a significant reduction in bladder outlet obstruction index. Thus, the present data show that high-power PVP can achieve and maintain the same results as TURP over a period of 24 months regarding an aspect that is particularly important for maintaining vesical health (i.e. detrusor pressure during the evacuation of the bladder). Such urodynamic data describing the functional outcome of PVP are currently missing from the literature."
CD009647,0,19187399,0,Loop diuretics can cause clinical natriuretic failure: a prescription for volume expansion.,"Ultrafiltration enhances volume removal and weight reduction vs diuretics. However, their differential impact on total body sodium, potassium, and magnesium has not been described. Fifteen patients with congestion despite diuretic therapy had urine electrolytes measured after a diuretic dose. Ultrafiltration was initiated and ultrafiltrate electrolytes were measured. The urine sodium after diuretics (60+/-47 mmol/L) was less than in the ultrafiltrate (134+/-8.0 mmol/L) (P=.000025). The urine potassium level after diuretics (41+/-23 mmol/L) was greater than in the ultrafiltrate (3.7+/-0.6 mmol/L) (P=.000017). The urine magnesium level after diuretics (5.2+/-3.1 mg/dL) was greater than in the ultrafiltrate (2.9+/-0.7 mg/dL) (P=.017). In acute decompensated heart failure patients with congestion despite diuretic therapy, diuretics are poor natriuretics and cause significant potassium and magnesium loss. Ultrafiltration extracts more sodium while sparing potassium and magnesium. The sustained clinical benefits of ultrafiltration compared with diuretics may be partly related to their disparate effects on total body sodium, potassium, and magnesium, in addition to their differential efficacy of volume removal."

The Vurea parameter has been approximated empirically using total body water (TBW) estimates derived from anthropometric formulas or measured by bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). The author compared TBW values derived using various anthropometric formulas (Watson, Hume, Randall, Tzamaloukas, Chertow) and BIA to the Vurea parameter calculated using three point variable volume single pool urea kinetic modeling. A total of 127 chronic hemodialysis patients were studied (mean age 66 +/- 13 years; 42% female; 37% black; 47% diabetic). Agreement between anthropometric formulas, BIA, and Vurea values was assessed by linear regression and Bland Altman analyses. The closest correlations were obtained with the BIA (r = 0.972), Chertow (r = 0.917), and Tzamaloukas (r = 0.905) methods. When compared with Vurea, 95% confidence intervals by Bland Altman analysis were lowest with BIA (4L) and highest with the Watson method (8L). These results indicate that BIA best approximates Vurea in dialysis patients."

CD009647,0,21395140,0,[Management of patients with chronic renal failure during surgical correction of cardiovascular disease].,"End-stage of chronic renal failure (CRF) is frequently associated with cardiac and vascular comorbidities requiring cardiosurgical interventions. Over 9 years, from 2000 to 2009, the A. N. Bakulev Research Center of Cardiovascular Surgery, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, delivered cardiosurgical care to 16 patients aged 20 to 74 years with end-stage CRF. The duration of programmed hemodialysis was 1 to 102 months. The preoperative patient preparation protocol comprised correction of anemia, hypoproteinemia, hypertension, and water-electrolyte and acid-base balances. Five patients underwent endovascular myocardial revascularization; open heart surgery was performed in one patient. Interventions under extracorporeal circulation were made in 10 other patients. Ultrafiltration was intraoperatively carried out. On-line hemodiafiltration was performed following coronary artery stenting. After open operations, renal replacement therapy (first hemodiafiltration, then hemodialysis) as daily sessions was initiated on day 2 and, when the patients were transferred to intensive care units, it was performed by the programmed hemodialysis protocol. There were no fatal outcomes at the follow-up. The key aspects of treatment success achievement and improved quality of life in patients on programmed hemodialysis are the detection of cardiovascular diseases requiring surgery, the timely referral of the patients to a cardiosurgical hospital, the meticulous pre- and perioperative management (correction of anemia, hypoproteinemia, water-electrolyte balance, use of ultrafiltration and the adequate rate of perfusion at the stage of extracorporeal circulation, and daily renal replacement therapy in the postoperative period), and continuity in the work of all specialists."
CD009647,0,22183521,0,Formulation of a dry weight bioimpedance index in hemodialysis patients.,"Hydration status has a major impact on hemodialysis (HD) patients. Overhydration is related to hypertension, pulmonary and peripheral edema, and other cardiovascular events; while dehydration is related to hypotension, and other severe ischemic symptoms. All result in increased morbidity and mortality. Bioimpedance has been newly developed to measure the amount of water in the body. Several predictive equations were used, taken from demographic and anthropometric data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the body composition of HD patients and to propose a hydration index. We performed bioimpedance measures with the Tanita TBF-300 scale, which calculates Total Body Water (TBW). The tool was reliable, with good reproducibility. However, we found significant differences between weight variations (dW) and TBW variations (dTBW) during HD sessions. This paper proposes a hydration index (I=dW-dTBW), with the hypothesis that dry weight is reached when I=0, while I>0 or I<0 indicate overhydrated or dehydrated, respectively. In this study, the changes in the index corresponded to the variations in weight and hydration state. We conclude that impedancemetry is a currently available technique that can be used to estimate TBW in HD patients. Although the index has to be improved by complementary studies, it may be a good guide to assess the dry weight achieved."

CD009647,0,20030285,0,[True body water volume in patients on peritoneal dialysis].,"Body water volume (BWV) equals urea distribution volume (UDV), crucial for accurate calculation of dialysis dosage from urea clearance in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis. BWV is precisely determined only by monitoring tritium--or deuterium--labeled water concentration in patient plasma. These are not routine methods, thus a number of alternative methods and anthropometric formulas have been used instead trying to determine BWV from patient body weight and body height, age and sex. These methods are relatively simple but not fully reliable. In the present study, BWV being mostly determined by use of Watson formula at the time of peritoneal dialysis and upon switching to hemodialysis or undergoing kidney transplantation, was monitored in peritoneal dialysis patients to demonstrate that it significantly exceeded the value obtained by the formula. Immediately before switching to hemodialysis or undergoing kidney transplantation, 39 patients (14 female, 25 male) without dialysate in the abdomen had a mean body weight of 74.60 +/- 12 kg and mean BWV of 37.90 +/- 5.80 L according to Watson formula. In the first month of switching to another dialysis method, all patients reduced their body weight by a mean of 3.35 +/- 2.55 kg. Now, their mean body weight was 71.25 +/- 11.45 kg and mean BWV 36.80 +/- 5.50 L. However, differences in the mean body weight and BWV did not reach statistical significance (t body weight = 1.25; t body water = 0.84; p>0.05). The body weight reduction during the period of observation could have almost certainly been ascribed to the accumulated fluid elimination. This in turn implies that immediately before switching to hemodialysis or undergoing kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis patients had a total body water greater by a mean of 3.35 +/- 2.55 L than the figure obtained by Watson formula. Thus, their BWV was not 37.90 +/- 5.80 L (50.80 +/- 7.75% of body weight) but 41.25 +/- 6.85 L (55.16 +/- 9.15% of body weight). According to t-test, then their true BWV statistically significantly (by 8.83%) exceeded the figure yielded by the formula (t=2.39; p<0.05), the Kt/V was falsely higher by approximately the same percentage, and the BWV reduction upon switching from peritoneal dialysis to another dialysis method or undergoing kidney transplantation was statistically significant (41.25 +/- 6.85 vs. 36.80 +/- 5.50 L; t=3.20; p<0.01). In conclusion, retrograde assessment of BWV in patients treated by peritoneal dialysis showed the BWV calculated by the most widely used anthropometric formula to be considerably underestimated and urea clearance overestimated for the same reason."
CD009647,0,6140341,0,Evidence that patients with Addison's disease are undertreated with fludrocortisone.,"Ten patients with Addison's disease, nine with undetectable plasma aldosterone, were found to be sodium and water depleted with high levels of plasma-renin activity despite receiving 0.05-0.1 mg/day of fludrocortisone and optimum doses of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Fludrocortisone was withdrawn while patients were in hospital on a fixed sodium intake. There was an immediate natriuresis with a further increase in plasma-renin activity. When a daily dose of 0.3 mg of fludrocortisone was given all patients retained sodium and water and gained weight. There was a fall in plasma-renin activity in all patients and an associated fall in blood urea and plasma potassium, and an increase in plasma volume; oedema developed in some patients. At outpatient follow-up, the dose of fludrocortisone was adjusted according to plasma-renin activity. Most patients required 0.2 mg of fludrocortisone to maintain adequate sodium and water balance. These results suggest that patients with Addison's disease on 0.05-0.1 mg of fludrocortisone with undetectable plasma aldosterone levels are currently being undertreated with fludrocortisone. The best way of assessing sodium balance in these patients and their response to fludrocortisone is by measurement of plasma-renin activity in conjunction with 24 h urinary sodium excretion."

CD009647,0,7353449,0,The colon influences ileal resection diarrhea.,"Fecal mass and electrolyte concentrations from 25 ileectomy and/or colectomy patients on known diets were used to assess those factors most responsible for their diarrhea. In 18 ileectomy patients the severity of diarrhea, expressed as a fecal weight, was a function of both percent of colon and centimeters of ileum removed. Linear regression analysis, however, showed that the extent of missing colon had three times the effect of missing ileum on fecal weight. Patients who lost the ileocecal valve and part of the right colon had more diarrhea than those who lost comparable lengths of ileum but had this area preserved. Fecal ion concentrations seemed independent of diet but were related to fecal weight and the amount of colon and ileum removed. Potassium concentration was strongly dependent on the amount of colon lost, while sodium concentration was more influenced by the length of resected ileum. Choloride was most dependent on fecal weight. As expected, fecal fat correlated strongly with the extent of ileum removed. Regresison equations were constructed from the electrolyte data which described and predicted the extent of lost ileum or colon. Our data were also used to separate patients with less than 100 cm of ileum removed from those with more extensive resections. The severity of diarrhea following ileal resection depends primarily on the amount of contiguous colon removed. Varying loss of ileum and colon produced predictable effects on fecal weight and electrolyte composition. Surgeons should preserve the maximum amount of colon possible to reduce the severity of diarrhea in these patients."

Patients were assigned at random to receive one or other combination for 8 weeks, dosage being determined by the severity of the individual patient's condition (range 1 to 3 tablets frusemide/amiloride; 2 to 6 tablets bumetanide/potassium chloride). Clinical assessments, including visual analogue scores for dyspnoea at rest and on effort, and laboratory measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels were carried out on entry and after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Other variables were monitored before, during and/or after treatment. Although significant decreases were reported in dyspnoea severity scores at rest and on effort only in the bumetanide/potassium chloride group, global assessment of the patients' condition by patient and clinician at the end of the study indicated that both treatments produced improvement, and a greater proportion of patients considered treatment as satisfactory in the frusemide/amiloride group. Both drug combinations were well-tolerated and only a few minor side-effects were reported. Serum potassium levels were maintained in both treatment groups but there was a significant decrease in mean serum magnesium levels in patients on bumetanide/potassium chloride. Hyponatraemia was also detected in 2 patients on this combination. An increase in body weight was recorded in both groups, the increase being significant in patients receiving bumetanide/potassium chloride."

To evaluate whether growth hormone (GH) can promote anabolism in surgical patients, 11 stable malnourished individuals were studied. In the initial trial, subjects received a constant parenteral infusion of a hypocaloric diet that provided approximately 1100 kcal/24 hr and 1.3 g protein/kg/24 hr for at least 2 weeks. During 1 week, GH 10 mg was given subcutaneously daily, whereas the other week served as the control. Daily balance studies demonstrated that administration of GH resulted in significant retention of nitrogen (+3.4 g/24 h) and phosphorus (+218 mg/24 h), despite provision of only 60% of caloric requirements. With GH, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and potassium fell, whereas glucose and insulin tended to rise, and levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 increased three to fourfold. Weight gain occurred with GH and was associated with positive mineral and water balance. Six patients received GH (10 mg subcutaneously daily) for 13-25 consecutive days after an initial control week. Significant nitrogen and phosphorus retention occurred over the entire period of GH administration, and no significant side effects were observed. In these depleted patients, GH caused significant and sustained nitrogen retention over a wide range of nutritional support. GH appears to enhance the efficacy of parenteral nutrition in stable individuals requiring repletion of body protein."
CD009647,0,6624145,0,[Principles of pharmacotherapy in geriatrics].,"This article examines the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs under the aspects of senile changes in organs and systems in the neurohumoral regulation and in metabolism. It gives reasons for the inadequacy of polypharmacy in the treatment of elderly and old people and for the need of a strict individualization. The retarded reactivity of the organism of old people, their increased susceptibility and reduced tolerance of the effects of drugs necessitate smaller dosages of drugs in geriatrics in comparison with the generally usual dosages, especially at the beginning of treatment. The multitude of exogenous and endogenous changes in the organism, that go hand in hand with the process of aging, leads in old people to an increased susceptibility to more frequent and pronounced secondary effects caused by drugs. Of special importance in the prevention of a possible intoxication by drugs are, in the case of elderly people, the proper composition of food, the water balance and the electrolyte metabolism."

Twelve patients for CABG were studied. The optical sensor was incorporated in the venous outlet site of CPB to measure Hct and hemoglobin oxygen saturation. The infusion of the cardioplegia caused a sharp deviation in BV%, and the use of extracorporeal ultrafiltration helped to reduce BV% rapidly. At the end of CPB, BV% was -1.4 +/- 7.7% and showed a good correlation with total water balance during CPB (r = 0.75, P < 0.01). However, the discrepancy between BV% and the positive water balance was observed in a case with LOS. This suggests fluid maldistribution from intra- to extra-vascular space. Continuous BV% monitoring during CPB is useful as an index of water balance and for assessing an optimum blood volume."

Hemodynamic parameters of resuscitation were measured in ten of the patients using a Swan-Ganz catheter. In spite of signs of hemodynamic stability, these patients demonstrated mean cardiac indices (CI) below their age-corrected norms and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWP) below 5 mm Hg through 24 hours, yet 92% of the patients produced normal or super-normal volumes of urine. Hemodynamic monitoring may be helpful for precise fluid replacement in extensively burned elderly patients; however, a normal CI and PCWP may not be the appropriate endpoint for resuscitation of the elderly when using HLS. This review supports the concept that HLS resuscitation of critically burned older patients is both safe and efficacious, leading to an 81% survival of this severely compromised group well past the resuscitation phase of injury."
CD009647,0,20938142,0,Preservation of residual renal function with HDF.,"Previous studies have shown that the presence of the residual renal function (RRF) is associated with a lower mortality risk in hemodialysis (HD) patients. A factor promoting a decrease in the RRF has been reported to be dehydration. Therefore, we performed HD or online hemodiafiltration (HDF) without water removal, in which intravascular dehydration due to water removal during dialysis are avoided. We also examined the RRF-maintaining effects of online HDF. Water removal-free dialysis study: The subjects were 44 HD patients within 3 months after the introduction of dialysis. They were divided into two groups: a group undergoing water removal-free dialysis at least for more than 3 months (group A) and a group undergoing dialysis with water removal (group B). Group A consisted of 28 patients including 5 in whom online HDF was initially introduced. Group B consisted of 16 patients on HD with water removal. In each group, the 24-hour urine volume was examined. The follow-up period was 36 months. In group A, the daily urine volume after 6 months or more was significantly larger. The mean water removal-free dialysis period was 18.1 ± 16.2 months. Study of the effects of online HDF on the RRF: The subjects were 49 patients undergoing maintenance dialysis. The 24-hour urine volume was measured. We compared an online HDF group (n = 37) with a HD group (n = 12). We examined the relationship between the duration of dialysis and urine volume. In the HDF group the r value was 0.333 (p = 0.044) and in the HD group it was 0.834 (p = 0.007). There was a significant difference in the correlation coefficient between the two groups (p = 0.024), suggesting that HDF is more useful than HD for maintaining the urine volume for a prolonged period."

CD009647,0,15034110,0,Relative contribution of residual renal function and different measures of adequacy to survival in hemodialysis patients: an analysis of the Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis (NECOSAD)-2.,"A high delivered Kt/V(urea) (dKt/V(urea)) is advocated in the U.S. National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines on hemodialysis (HD) adequacy, irrespective of the presence of residual renal function. The contribution of treatment adequacy and residual renal function to patient survival was investigated. The Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis is a prospective multicenter study that includes incident ESRD patients older than 18 yr. The longitudinal data on residual renal function and dialysis adequacy of patients who were treated with HD 3 mo after the initiation of dialysis (n = 740) were analyzed. The mean renal Kt/V(urea) (rKt/V(urea)) at 3 mo was 0.7/wk (SD 0.6) and the dKt/V(urea) at 3 mo was 2.7/wk (SD 0.8). Both components of urea clearance were associated with a better survival (for each increase of 1/wk in rKt/V(urea), relative risk of death = 0.44 [P < 0.0001]; dKt/V(urea), relative risk of death = 0.76 [P < 0.01]). However, the effect of dKt/V(urea) on mortality was strongly dependent on the presence of rKt/V(urea), low values for dKt/V(urea) of <2.9/wk being associated with a significantly higher mortality in anuric patients only. Furthermore, an excess of ultrafiltration in relation to interdialytic weight gain was associated with an increase in mortality independent of dKt/V(urea). In conclusion, residual renal clearance seems to be an important predictor of survival in HD patients, and the dKt/V(urea) should be tuned appropriately to the presence of renal function. Further studies are required to substantiate the important role of fluid balance in HD adequacy."

Each patient had at least two significant medical problems that were thought to place him or her at increased risk. The usefulness of this monitoring approach in the perioperative management of these patients is demonstrated by several clinical examples.

CD009647,0,9626467,0,Prognostic value of prostate-specific antigen for women with breast cancer: a large United States cohort study.,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a valuable tumor marker used for diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. Recently, PSA has been found in various female tissues and body fluids. Female breasts, both normal and abnormal, including cancerous tissues, can produce PSA, and this production is regulated by androgens and progestins. Preliminary data suggested that patients with breast tumors positive for PSA may have better prognosis compared to those with PSA-negative breast tumors. This study examines the prognostic value of PSA in a large cohort study of United States patients. Using a PSA assay that has a lower detection limit of 0.001 ng/ml, we measured PSA in tumor cytosolic extracts of 953 women with primary breast cancer. Other information available for this study included age, follow-up time, survival outcome, tumor size, nodal status, steroid hormone receptor levels, DNA analysis by flow cytometry, and postoperative treatment. The median follow-up time was 73 months. During the follow-up, 200 patients relapsed and 188 died. PSA presence was found to be significantly associated with smaller tumors, tumors with low S-phase fraction, diploid tumors, younger patient age, and tumors with lower cellularity. Survival analysis indicated that the relative risks (RRs) for relapse and death were both significantly lower [RR = 0.67 (P = 0.01) for relapse; RR = 0.72 (P = 0.05) for death] in PSA-positive patients (levels higher than the 30th percentile of PSA values) than in PSA-negative patients. The reduced risks for relapse and death remained statistically significant after other clinical and pathological variables were adjusted in the multivariate analysis [RR = 0.68 (P = 0.02) for relapse; RR = 0.65 (P = 0.02) for death]. Our results suggest that the measurement of PSA in breast tumor extracts provides additional information on the prognosis of patients with primary breast cancer."

Clinical, radiological and pathological aspects.","Myopathy accompanying familial hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is much less well documented than the paralytic attacks from which the disease derives its name. Eleven affected members of a large kinship with HPP were studied clinically and radiologically for the presence of myopathy. In 4 patients muscle biopsies were also performed and in 1 of them the histological findings obtained at autopsy were compared with the CT scans of various muscles. In another patient not previously biopsied, the specimens of both amputated legs were examined histologically. The age of the studied individuals ranged from 33 to 74 yrs. The 4 youngest patients showed no clinical signs of myopathy. However, in 2 of them CT scans demonstrated discrete hypodense lesions in the leg muscles, whereas in the other 2, muscle biopsies showed a vacuolar myopathy. The other 7 patients, all older than 50 yrs, presented both clinical and CT evidence of myopathy of proximal and distal muscles ranging from very mild to very severe, males being slightly more affected than females. In all 11 patients a mean CT grading was made that was based on the abnormalities found in the different muscle groups. The myopathy appeared to be unrelated to the history of paralytic attacks, but a strong correlation was found between age and mean CT grading. It was concluded that HPP is a myopathy with permanent muscle weakness of late onset in all the patients. The expression of the paralytic attacks is variable."
CD009647,0,12050241,0,Gender-specific responses of lean body composition and non-gender-specific cardiac function improvement after GH replacement in GH-deficient adults.,"GH deficiency (GHD) in adulthood is accompanied by physical and psychological impairments. One hundred fifteen patients (67 male, 48 female) with pronounced GHD were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with objectives that included effects on body composition, cardiac structure, and function and safety of replacement therapy with recombinant human GH (Saizen). Sixty patients (31 male, 29 female) received GH at a dose of 0.005-0.010 mg/kg.d, and 55 patients (36 male, 19 female) received placebo for 6 months. Assessment of body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry demonstrated a treatment difference in lean body mass increase of 2.1 kg (between-group comparison, P < 0.0001), which was significantly greater among males than females (P < 0.0001) [males: GH, +3.13 kg (2.42, 3.84); placebo, +0.11 kg (-0.60, 0.82); and females: GH, +0.64 kg (-0.15, 1.44); placebo: -0.90 kg (-2.20, 0.39)] [mean change 0-6 months (95% confidence limits)] and was associated with IGF-I changes. The decrease in fat mass of 2.8 kg (between-group comparison, P < 0.0001) noted by DEXA was also evident from bioelectric impedance and anthropometric measurements. Echocardiography showed comparable improvement in left ventricular systolic function after GH treatment in both genders. End-systolic volume decreased by 4.3 +/- 10.5 ml (from 35.8 +/- 17.6 ml; between-group comparison, P = 0.035) and ejection fraction increased by 5.1 +/- 10.0% (from 55.0 +/- 11.2%; between-group comparison, P = 0.048), approaching normalcy. Diastolic function did not change as assessed by isovolumic relaxation time, early diastolic flow, diastolic flow secondary to atrial contraction, or ratio of peak mitral early diastolic and atrial contraction velocity. GH treatment was well tolerated, with adverse events primarily related to effects on fluid balance. No apparent relationship between IGF-I levels and the occurrence or severity of adverse events was identified. In conclusion, GH replacement therapy in adults with GHD demonstrated beneficial effects on lean body mass composition that was more pronounced in males than females. In contrast, cardiac function improvement appears to benefit both genders equally."

CD009647,0,8515849,0,[Plasma levels of atriopeptin and hemodynamics during major vascular surgery: comparison between isoflurane and propofol+fentanyl].,"Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone released from atrial cardiocytes in response to atrial stretch. It has potent and selective effects on vascular smooth muscle, fluid and electrolyte balance, and may interact with other vasoactive substances. The influence of anaesthesia and major vascular surgery on the release and circulation of ANF is unknown. Therefore the relationships between haemodynamic variables, volume expansion and plasma ANF were studied in patients undergoing resection of abdominal aortic aneurysm, randomly assigned to receive isoflurane or propofol+fentanyl anaesthesia. The end point of anaesthetic regimens was the stabilization of mean arterial pressure between +/- 33% from baseline. Haemodynamic parameters and plasma ANF levels were measured preoperatively, after intubation, following aortic cross-clamping, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. Because of well-known large degree in interpatient pharmacodynamic variability, anaesthesia with propofol and fentanyl did not ensure, usually, the established end point in dose ranges that did not produce unacceptable morbidity. ANF plasma levels were elevated during surgery and in the immediate postoperative period in both groups. A significant correlation was found between ANF levels and mean right atrial pressure. We concluded that anaesthetic drugs do not affect ANF release. Volume expansion for prevention of declamping shock increased, ANF from basal values, during surgery. Inadequacy of postoperative analgesia or persisting atrial stretch could explain the finding of high plasma levels during the immediate postoperative period."

CD009647,0,21046063,0,[Of bugs and joints. Oligoarthritis caused by Tropheryma whipplei].,"Whipple's disease is a rare, chronic infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei, an ubiquitary gram positive bacterium. The disease is associated with a high mortality in absence of an antibiotic treatment. The disease can be detected in affected tissues and body fluids by light and electron microscopy, as well as by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia and arthritis frequently represent the first manifestation of this multi-system disease; typical subsequent symptoms are weight loss, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Symptoms of central nervous system involvement are present in 10-40% of cases. We report on a 67 year-old male with a history of migratory oligoarthritis over three decades in whom the causative agent was detected by PCR in synovial fluid only. This case illustrates that searches for the characteristic PAS-positive macrophages and PCR in biopsies from the duodenum may be insufficient and that diagnostic efforts should be complemented with PCR assays from affected tissues or body fluids. It is recommended that antibiotic treatment be carried out with an agent that penetrates well into the cerebrospinal fluid, e.g. ceftriaxone, followed by cotrimoxazole. Antibiotics should be maintained over several months to years. It is prudent to document the disappearance of the pathogen in the affected compartments prior to the discontinuation of the antibiotic therapy."
CD009647,0,8693486,0,Changes in plasma vasopressin levels and cardiovascular function due to postural changes in diabetic neuropathy.,"Decreases in blood pressure are well known to increase the release of vasopressin. Studies were carried out to investigate whether vasopressin responses to postural changes in blood pressure are maintained in diabetic patients with orthostatic hypotension [DM-OH(+)] as well as non-diabetic patients with orthostatic hypotension [nonDM-OH(+)] and these responses were compared with those observed in normal subjects and diabetic patients without orthostatic hypotension [DM-OH(-)]. After 30 min in the supine position, the upright posture for 40 min was maintained and then the supine for 10 min. Blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured every 5 min and plasma vasopressin levels (plasma AVP) were determined every 10 min. In normal subjects and DM-OH(-), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) did not change, but HR increased significantly by the upright position. Plasma AVP did not change in these groups. On the other hand, in DM-OH(+) MABP fell abruptly and remained to decrease during the upright posture. The HR responses in this group, however, were similar to those in normal control and DM-OH(-). Plasma AVP in DM-OH(+) significantly increased only at 30 min during upright. These increases were significantly greater than those in normal and DM-OH(-). There were significant correlation in changes in MABP (delta MAP) and plasma AVP (delta AVP) in DM-OH(+) (delta AVP = -0.13 MABP + 1.5, r = -0.32, p < 0.01). Relationship between delta MABP and delta AVP in nonDM-OH(+) was similar to that in DM-OH(+). It is concluded that AVP responses to orthostatic hypotension in diabetic and non-diabetic neuropathies were attenuated, but heart rate responses in these patients ware well reserved."
CD009647,0,8803989,0,Multifrequency bioimpedance in assessment of dry weight in haemodialysis.,"The use of multifrequency bioimpedance (MFB) for determination of dry weight (DW) in haemodialysis (HD) patients was evaluated in three studies. In Study 1, the fluid state [total body water (TBW) and extracellular volume (ECV)] was measured by MFB in 82 normotensive patients. 41 hypertensive patients and in 30 healthy subjects. TBW and ECV were expressed as per cent of body weight (BW). In Study 2, DW of five hypertensive HD patients was gradually decreased during 3 months and ECV (MFB) and blood pressure (48 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) were measured at the beginning and end of study. In Study 3, we measured the fluid status repeatedly by MFB and the diameter of the inferior vena cava (DIVC) by ultrasound before, during and 2 h post-HD. In Study 1, the hypertensive patients had significantly greater TBW (P < 0.05) than the normotensive patients before (50.3 +/- 6.5% vs 47.6 +/- 5.8%) and after HD (48.8 +/- 7.8% vs 45.7 +/- 6.4%) and ECV (P < 0.001) before (29.4 +/- 3.6% vs 26.8 +/- 3.5%) and after HD (27.0 +/- 4.0% vs 24.6 +/- 3.5%), Post-HD ECV in the normotensive patients was similar to that in the healthy subjects. In Study 2, more efficient ultrafiltration resulted in reduction of BW and ECV along with a decrease in blood pressure and need for antihypertensive medication. In Study 3, both ECV and DIVC decreased following the removal of fluid during HD. ECV maintained stable values during the post-HD period, unlike DIVC which increased significantly (P < 0.005) due to refilling from the interstitial space. We conclude that MFB is an appropriate non-invasive method for DW determination, which is highly reproducible and technically simple to use."
CD009647,0,18306678,0,[Marked hyponatremia with consciousness disturbance probably caused by linezolid in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia].,"We report the case of a 75-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia who developed hyponatremia after linezolid administration. Because induction therapy did not achieve complete remission for this man, we initiated re-induction therapy with enocitabin and daunomycin. Seven days after chemotherapy, the patient experienced a catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) due to methicilin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). When treatment with albekacin and fosfomycin was in effective, linezolid was administrated intravenously and he became afebrile. On day 8 after linezolid administration, however, he reported general fatigue and slight consciousness disturbance. His serum sodium concentration was 119 mEq/L and his urinary sodium excretion rose to 143 mEq/day, although intravenous sodium intake was 98 mEq/day. Because of the sufficiency of urine volume and weight loss, we surmise that inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) syndrome was unlikely. We diagnosed renal salt wasting syndrome (RSWS) based on calculation of the amount of sodium intake and the amount of sodium excreted from the kidneys. After linezolid was discontinued and aggressive treatment with sodium supplement begun, his consciousness cleared as his low serum sodium level rose. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first case reported on the development of RSWS after linezolid treatment. Although the process remains unclear, our case suggests that linezolid may induce RSWS after intensive chemotherapy."

CD009647,0,11835343,0,Coagulation changes in individuals with sickle cell trait.,"Sickle cell disorders, such as Hb SS and Hb SC, are associated with a hypercoagulable state that may contribute to the vaso-occlusive episodes observed in the disorders. To what extent increased coagulation activity occurs in individuals with sickle cell trait has had limited study. Because such information may help clarify clinical and pathologic findings that may occur in these individuals and may be useful in clarifying the hypercoagulable state in sickle cell disease, we have examined individuals with Hb AS to determine the extent that increased coagulation activity does occur. We measured d-dimers, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes, prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F1.2), absolute blood monocyte levels, proteins C and S, and isotypes of antiphospholipid antibodies in individuals with Hb AS and in matched controls (Hb AA). Results showed that d-dimers, TAT, and F1.2 were increased significantly above normal levels. Absolute blood monocyte levels were increased. The d-dimers, TAT, F1.2, and monocyte counts showed significant increasing trends through groups of increasing severity (Hb AA, Hb AS, Hb SC, and Hb SS). Our study shows that individuals with Hb AS have increased coagulation activity, with d-dimers, TAT, and F1.2 being consistent indicators. The measures of coagulation activity in Hb AS are lower than in patients with Hb SC and Hb SS disease. These results extend our previous observation that the degree of coagulation activation parallels the degree of disease severity among sickle cell genotypes. The findings suggest that monocytosis, with the possible expression of monocyte-derived tissue factor, and the associated hypercoagulable state are driven by disease severity."
CD009647,0,8417662,0,Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema complicating lung resection.,"Postresectional pulmonary edema is a rare but potentially fatal complication of thoracic operations. In a retrospective study of 402 lung resections we have identified 11 cases of postresectional, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. We have analyzed the individual data to test recognized hypotheses regarding this condition. Pulmonary edema occurred in 5.1% of right pneumonectomies, 4.0% of left pneumonectomies, and 1% of all lobectomies. In 2 patients the symptoms occurred immediately after operation; in the other 9 the mean interval to diagnosis was 43.4 hours. All 11 patients were in a positive fluid balance in the first 24 hours after operation (mean, 20.8 +/- 9.1 mL/kg). However, there was no significant difference between this value and the respective values for control groups of 20 patients having pneumonectomies and 20 patients having lobectomies in whom pulmonary edema did not develop. Our findings differ from other reported series in that perioperative fluid overload was not found to be a significant contributory factor in the development of postresectional pulmonary edema. We discuss other possible mechanisms for this phenomenon."
CD009647,0,8396369,0,"Responsiveness to dopamine of isolated epicardial coronary arteries from humans, monkeys, and dogs.","Dopamine is widely used for the treatment of cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock. This study was undertaken to compare the response to dopamine in epicardial conduit coronary arteries of humans, Japanese monkeys, and dogs, and to determine the mechanism of vasoconstriction and vasodilation. In helical strips of coronary arteries from humans and monkeys partially contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha, dopamine produced a concentration-related contraction; the human artery contraction was greater. The contractions were reversed to a relaxation by treatment with phentolamine. Relaxation of monkey arteries treated with the alpha adrenoceptor antagonist was not influenced by metoprolol, a beta 1 antagonist, or endothelium denudation, but was reversed to contraction by SCH23390, a dopamine1 receptor antagonist. On the other hand, dog coronary arteries responded to dopamine with a relaxation that was abolished by metoprolol, but not influenced by SCH23390 or butoxamine, a beta 2 antagonist. We conclude that dopamine in clinical doses elicits significant contractions, mediated possibly by alpha adrenoceptors, in human and monkey coronary arteries; thus, care has to be taken when the amine is used in patients with variant angina pectoris. Relaxation of monkey coronary arteries appears to be associated with activation of dopamine1 receptors, whereas those of the dog arteries are mediated mainly by beta 1 receptors."
CD009647,0,11576887,0,Role of bioimpedance spectroscopy in assessment of body water compartments in hemodialysis patients.,"Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) has been advocated as a tool to assess fluid status in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, uncertainty remains about the reliability of BIS in patients with abnormalities in fluid status. Aims of the study are to assess the agreement between total-body water (TBW) and extracellular volume (ECW) measured by BIS and tracer dilution (deuterium oxide [D(2)O] and sodium bromide [NaBr]), the influence of the relative magnitude of water compartments (expressed as TBW(D(2)O) and ECW(NaBr):body weight) on the agreement between BIS and tracer dilution, and the ability of BIS to predict acute changes in fluid status. BIS and tracer dilution techniques were performed in 17 HD patients before a dialysis session. Moreover, the relation between BIS and gravimetric weight changes was assessed during both isolated ultrafiltration and HD. Correlation coefficients between TBW and ECW measured by BIS and tracer dilution were r = 0.71 and r = 0.71, respectively. Mean differences (tracer-BIS) were 6.9 L (limits of agreement, -1.5 to 21.6 L) for TBW and 2.3 L (limits of agreement, -1.7 to 9.7 L) for ECW. There was a significant relationship between the relative magnitude of TBW and ECW compartments and disagreement between BIS and tracer dilution (r = 0.65 and r = 0.77; P < 0.05). During both isolated ultrafiltration and HD, there was a significant relation between gravimetric changes and change in ECW(BIS) (r = 0.83 and r = 0.76; P < 0.05), but not with change in TBW(BIS). In conclusion, agreement between BIS and tracer dilution techniques in the assessment of TBW and ECW in HD patients is unsatisfactory. The discrepancy between BIS and dilution techniques is related to the relative magnitude of body water compartments. Nevertheless, BIS adequately predicted acute changes in ECW during isolated ultrafiltration and HD, in contrast to changes in TBW."

Variability in the patient's medical and physical management adds to this confusion, leading to the potential to misdiagnose an aware patient in Minimally Conscious State (MCS) as being in VS. Subsequently, this range of variables leads to inconsistencies in the assessment, clinical diagnosis and management of this patient group. This concept is clearly of great importance in terms of the patient's future management and life or death decisions when considering withdrawal of nutrition and hydration.

A dose of contrast medium of 500 mg I/kg body weight was given to each patient. Iohexol resulted in significantly fewer subjective adverse reactions than metrizoate. A similar image quality was obtained with the two contrast media. No clinically significant difference existed between the two contrast media with respect to influence on blood pressure, pulse or clinical chemical parameters. A tendency to deterioration of renal function after urography was found in both groups, but no difference of statistical significance existed between the two contrast media with respect to possible nephrotoxicity. Inadequate hydration may have been partly responsible for the nephrotoxic effect of the urographic procedure."

For elucidation of the result of the clinical treatment two casuistic cases are described. The probability of mortality or survival-rate is calculated, periods of observation could be achieved up to more than nine years. It is endeavoured to compare the results with observations of patients-collectives, that are known from the literature. Statistically significant decreases in weight are objectified. When examining the reactions of blood-pressure at the Spironolacton-therapy no statistically significant alterations of blood-pressure could be observed with those cardiac-decompensated patients. 6.25 per cent of the considered serum-potassium-data were underneath the limitations of lower standard, at 1.875 per cent of the measured values a hyperkalemia existed. No clinical side-effects could be observed except the incidence of a gynaecomastia with two male patients.

Nocturnal diuresis decreased after one and two months by 21% and 20% in the men and by 36% and 34% in the women, respectively. Half of the change persisted among the women but not among the men one month after the treatment. The decrease in nocturnal diuresis was greatest among those who, before the treatment, had a large part of their diuresis during the night. Diuresis during the day changed only insignificantly. Body weight did not change during treatment, nor did blood pressure, osmolality, sodium or potassium in serum. Sleep improved during treatment. In one case, side-effects were observed, with a feeling of swelling in the body and decreased diuresis in the morning."

A comparison of general and epidural anaesthesia.,"The superficial and deep body temperatures of 15 patients were measured before, during and for 6 hours after transvesical prostatectomy. The patients were divided randomly into two groups who received either a standard general anaesthetic or epidural analgesia. Total body heat and mean body temperature fell more rapidly in the epidural group, reaching statistical significance in the early postoperative period. Both groups showed a net heat gain 6 hours postoperatively. One patient in each group became hypothermic (core temperature less than 35 degrees C). Warming of both intravenous and bladder irrigation fluids to body temperature is recommended for patients receiving epidural or general anaesthesia."
CD009647,0,1484152,0,Bed-rest-induced hypernatriuresis in cirrhotic patients without ascites: does it contribute to maintain 'compensation'?,"Renal function, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration and urine excretion of free norepinephrine were evaluated in 13 cirrhotics without previous or ongoing ascites and in 13 healthy subjects, after 6 days of controlled electrolyte intake (40 mmol of Na and 70 mmol of K per day) and during 24 h of recumbency. Plasma concentrations of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were also measured in 8 patients and 8 controls. Despite a low-normal filtered load of sodium (14.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 17.1 +/- 1.2 mmol/min), cirrhotic patients showed supernormal natriuresis (141.5 +/- 14.1 vs. 78.8 +/- 8.6 mmol/day; p < 0.001). Whereas the fractional excretion of sodium in these patients was twice that of controls (0.70 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.04%; p < 0.001), potassium excretion (42.5 +/- 2.7 vs. 43.1 +/- 2.7 mmol/day) and urine volume (1270 +/- 98 vs. 1452 +/- 148 ml/day) did not differ. In cirrhotics, plasma renin activity was reduced (0.50 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.39 +/- 0.33 ng/ml/h; p < 0.02), and plasma aldosterone concentration tended to be lower (66 +/- 10 vs. 86 +/- 9 pg/ml; p = 0.09), while urine norepinephrine excretion did not significantly differ from controls (961 +/- 120 vs. 782 +/- 43 ng/h). ANP was higher in patients than in controls (92 +/- 17 vs. 48 +/- 9 pg/ml; p < 0.05). Natriuresis was directly correlated with ANP (r = 0.69, p < 0.005) and ANP/plasma aldosterone ratio (r = 0.63; p < 0.01) in patients and healthy subjects taken together.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,2348127,0,[Study on changes in extravascular lung water during early postoperative periods in thoracic esophageal cancer--with special emphasis on their relation to postoperative renal function].,"Twenty-seven patients with esophageal cancer received an intrathoracic esophagectomy, lymphadenectomy and esophageal reconstruction performed in one stage. They were analyzed for respiratory and hemodynamic function parameters and also observed for the time course of extravascular lung water (EVLW), water balance, renal function as well as colloid osmotic pressure (COP) of plasma. And they were clarified the pathogenetic mechanism of post-operative pulmonary complications mainly from the aspects of pathophysiology of pulmonary edema and functional interrelationship of organs. Two groups of patients, i.e. those undergoing extended lymphadenectomy (particularly for lymph nodes of both sides of neck and upper mediastinum) and those of old age (70 years or above), were investigated for eventual characteristic features of postoperative changes in the parameters mentioned above. In the group of patients with postoperative pulmonary complications, a significant negative correlation was noted to exist between the plasma colloid osmotic pressure-pulmonary artery wedge pressure (COP-PAW) gradient and EVLW and between the former parameter and postoperative renal function (p less than 0.01). A postoperative lowering of renal function observed in the group with postoperative pulmonary complications was due mainly to depressed left ventricular function immediately following operation and assumed to play a significant role in the production of pulmonary edema as a hydrostatic factor subject to the Starling's low. In the group undergoing extended lymphadenectomy, extensive lymph node dissection reduced plasma colloid osmotic pressure. This reduction was thought to bring about a diminution of COP-PAW gradient, produce a transient depression of left ventricular function and augmentation of pulmonary edema, and to stimulate the formation of intrapulmonary shunting. In the old age group, their and renal function depressed immediately after operation because of advanced age. And for the maintenance of cardiac function massive water intake was required. They led to retention of water and thereby played a direct role in the causation of increase in EVLW and in intrapulmonary shunt. All these observations point to the necessity of initiating carefully planned management early in the postoperative period that takes these pathophysiologic features well into account."
CD009647,0,1859176,0,The clinical course of perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"We studied the early clinical course of 65 patients with perimesencephalic (nonaneurysmal) subarachnoid hemorrhage. None of the patients rebled; none had delayed cerebral ischemia; and only 3 patients (5%) developed clinical signs of acute hydrocephalus, 2 requiring ventricular shunting. Hyponatremia and electrocardiographic changes were found in the same proportions as in patients with aneurysmal rupture. All patients had a good outcome after 3 months. To control for the influence of the relatively small amount of cisternal blood in perimesencephalic hemorrhage on the absence of delayed cerebral ischemia, we compared these 65 patients with 49 patients who had aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This control group with aneurysms was selected according to a similar amount of cisternal blood, a comparable level of consciousness on admission, and absence of other factors known to increase the risk for delayed cerebral ischemia. We found that 4 of the 49 patients with aneurysmal hemorrhage developed delayed cerebral ischemia (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03); therefore the relatively small amount of blood does not account for the absence of delayed cerebral ischemia in perimesencephalic hemorrhage. Patients with a perimesencephalic pattern of hemorrhage and a normal angiogram should be considered to have a distinct subset of subarachnoid hemorrhage and should be excluded from future treatment trials of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage."
CD009647,0,12667775,0,Post-operative hyponatraemia in orthopaedic injury.,"Post-operative hyponatraemia can be dangerous and can go unrecognised as the presenting signs and symptoms are often confused with post-operative or post-anaesthesia sequelae. Infusion of dextrose containing fluids in the peri-operative period is a well-documented cause of this electrolyte imbalance. We conducted a retrospective study to identify the incidence of hyponatraemia following surgery for orthopaedic injury. Medical notes and fluid charts of the patients were scrutinised. We detected 32 cases of post-operative hyponatraemia over a period of 1 year. Eleven hundred and thirty-one patients underwent orthopaedic surgery during this period. Calculated incidence of hyponatraemia was 2.8%. In the hyponatraemic group, the mean pre-operative sodium was 134 mmol/l and mean post-operative sodium was 126 mmol/l. There was a statistically significant difference between mean pre-operative and mean post-operative serum sodium concentration (P<0.0001, two sample t-test). The mean volume of dextrose containing fluids received by each patient was 3.26 l. There is a significant risk of hyponatraemia following orthopaedic surgery, especially in the elderly. Orthopaedic units need to be aware of this easily avoidable condition. Fluid infusion regimes should be carefully formulated with exclusion of dextrose containing fluids to prevent the danger of hyponatraemia."

Three days later, he killed himself with a gunshot to the head. Clinicians often fail to recognize those at high risk for suicide. Suicidal risk is increased in both psychiatric and physical illness, and particularly when both are present. Psychiatric illness, particularly depression, often underlies chronic medical illness. The purpose of this case report is to remind health care providers of the strong association between depression and chronic medical illness, and to consider this in all patients, including those who present solely with physical symptoms. Recognizing this association and screening for it, as recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, may prevent the unnecessary tragedy of suicide."

In humans, the rarity of hepatic infarction is explained commonly on the basis of the double blood supply via the hepatic artery and portal vein. The imaging studies and clinical records of seven patients with hepatic infarcts were reviewed. These infarctions were essentially observed during post-operative periods: after aortoceliac graft and after accidental ligation of the hepatic artery (4 cases). The other etiologies included: acute hypovolemic shock in patients with atherosclerosis (2 cases) and finally one case of acute thrombocytosis. Dynamic CT was performed initially in all the cases and during the evolution, demonstrating peripheral low attenuation areas without enhancement. Associated splenic infarcts were present in 4 patients and renal infarcts in two. While the clinical and laboratory findings in hepatic infarction can be completely mimicked by hepatic abscess, CT-guided aspirations were performed in 6 patients demonstrating in only one case the presence of infection."

CD009647,0,7332917,0,Potassium loss associated with hydrochlorothiazide versus chlorthalidone.,"A retrospective survey using chart review was conducted to determine the incidence of clinically significant hypokalemia resulting from therapy with chlorthalidone (CTLD) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The frequency of hypokalemia, potassium less than or equal to 3.0 mEq/liter, was 4/29 patients (13.8%) in the CTLD once-daily group, 0/17 in the HCDL twice-daily group, and 0/31 in the HCTZ once-daily group. Using the Fisher exact probability test, a significant difference in the incidence of hypokalemia was observed between the CTLD once-daily and HCTZ once-daily groups. From the results, it is apparent that a diuretic's duration of actions, as represented by HCTZ (short-acting) and CTLD (long-acting), influences serum potassium concentrations; CTLD produced a greater incidence and degree of hypokalemia."

CD009647,0,7966996,0,Risk factors for the development of post-lab acute coronary occlusion following successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.,"Acute coronary occlusion can occur following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) upon return to the coronary care unit (CCU), and is sometimes life-threatening. To identify high-risk patients for acute occlusion following PTCA, we analyzed 11 patients with post-lab acute occlusion. All of the patients had some evidence of intimal tear or dissection at the site of dilatation. During the study period, 1343 patients (1998 lesions) with angina pectoris underwent PTCA. Of these, 331 vessels (17%) had some degree of intimal tear or dissection at the site of dilatation. From these 331, 50 patients (50 vessels) without evidence of acute occlusion were randomly selected to serve as the control group. Patients in the acute occlusion group had more extensive dissection (p < 0.05) and less water balance (drip-infused water-urine, ml) during angioplasty (p < 0.1) than those in the control group. Furthermore, a significantly higher percentage of patients in the acute occlusion group complained of chest discomfort upon arrival at the CCU (72% vs 8%, p < 0.0001). These variables may be useful in identifying high-risk patients for post-lab acute occlusion, particularly in the presence of an intimal tear or dissection at the target site."
CD009647,0,6440463,0,[Tuberculous meningitis in adults. Diagnostic elements: analysis of 32 cases].,"The aim of this study was to determine the value of paraclinical investigations in the diagnosis of 32 adults with TB meningitis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in spinal fluid cultures of 21 patients (66 p. 100). But only two had positive smears. In five with positive cultures the sampling was performed between one and 13 days after the beginning of chemotherapy. In 7 patients with negative spinal fluid cultures, mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in gastric contents aspiration (3); urine (2); bone marrow (1) and abscess (1). Cytochemical analysis of first spinal fluid samples showed an elevation of protein from 0.5 to 7 g/l in all patients (mean 2.1 +/- 1.6 g/l); sugar was low in 26 (mean 0.30 +/- 0.26 g/l); cell count was less than 500/mm3 in 26, with a mononuclear response in 24. 20 patients had lymphocytic and hypoglycorrachic meningitis. Cytochemical findings were independent of the delay between the first clinical symptoms and lumbar puncture. A. C. T. scan of the brain was performed in 8 patients with neurologic complications. Hydrocephalus was found in 3, and after the injection of contrast material, focal high-density areas in the basal cistern and the sulci of the cerebrum were observed in 2. Chest X ray showed miliary TB in 13 patients; but positive skin test for tuberculosis and hyponatremia were rarely helpful. To confirm adult tuberculous meningitis, we suggest that two spinal fluid samplings are necessary, but mycobacterium tuberculosis must be looked for simultaneously in the sputum, gastric contents, urine and bone marrow. Specific treatment can be started immediately after the first spinal fluid sampling. Chest X ray may be helpful, but C.T. scan of the brain and tuberculin test are of no value."
CD009647,0,21057782,0,"Blood, urine, and sweat (BUS) study: monitoring and elimination of bioaccumulated toxic elements.","There is limited understanding of the toxicokinetics of bioaccumulated toxic elements and their methods of excretion from the human body. This study was designed to assess the concentration of various toxic elements in three body fluids: blood, urine and sweat. Blood, urine, and sweat were collected from 20 individuals (10 healthy participants and 10 participants with various health problems) and analyzed for approximately 120 various compounds, including toxic elements. Toxic elements were found to differing degrees in each of blood, urine, and sweat. Serum levels for most metals and metalloids were comparable with those found in other studies in the scientific literature. Many toxic elements appeared to be preferentially excreted through sweat. Presumably stored in tissues, some toxic elements readily identified in the perspiration of some participants were not found in their serum. Induced sweating appears to be a potential method for elimination of many toxic elements from the human body. Biomonitoring for toxic elements through blood and/or urine testing may underestimate the total body burden of such toxicants. Sweat analysis should be considered as an additional method for monitoring bioaccumulation of toxic elements in humans."

CD009647,0,17417148,0,[A new approach for better comprehension of diseases of the ocular surface].,"The mechanistic view of dry eye disease aims at completing the classic etiological approach that classifies the disease as parallel ocular surface disorders leading to lacrimal film impairment and dry eye. This approach proposes two levels of ocular surface impairment (with standard etiologies, previously validated in the NEI/Industry workshop), which may not be independent diseases but rather risk factors and/or ways to enter a self-stimulated biological process involving the ocular surface. All external disorders proposed in this model, although unlikely to be fully exhaustive, are classical mechanisms considered to be causes of tear film impairment and ocular surface damage, by tear instability and evaporation, tear hyposecretion, or both. These mechanisms, sometimes alone--when severe or becoming chronic or repeatedly present on the ocular surface and when two or more are present--may cause the patient to enter the self-stimulated loop. Tear film instability/imbalance can be considered as the key point of dry eye disease. It will cause local or diffuse hyperosmolarity of the tear film and therefore of superficial epithelial cells of the cornea and/or conjunctiva, stimulating epithelial cells and resident inflammatory cells. Cell damage in the cornea and conjunctiva, by means of apoptosis and direct mechanical and/or osmotic stress, will stimulate the reflex neurosensory arc, in turn stimulating lacrimal gland and neurogenic inflammation, with inflammatory cytokine release, MMP activation, and inflammatory involvement of the conjunctival epithelium. Goblet cell loss is thus directly related to chronic inflammation and surface cell apoptosis subsequent to cell hyperosmolarity and chronic damage, resulting in further tear film instability/imbalance. On the other hand, bacterial changes and an imbalance resulting from specific diseases or from tear film abnormalities may trigger release of endotoxins, lipopolysaccharides, and/or lipase activation, causing eyelid inflammation, meibomian gland dysfunction, and lipidic changes, directly influencing tear film stability and favoring tear evaporation. The lipidic hypothesis therefore participates in the vicious circle as a parallel, independent, or complementary loop. This mechanistic approach proposes a synthetic combination of mechanisms previously validated independently, with two levels of ocular surface impairment, a first level including many possible acute or chronic causes that favor or trigger the imbalance and can be reversible if correctly and specifically managed when possible, and the further involvement of a series of biological cascades centered by tear film imbalance and inflammatory stimulation, finally acting as an independent vicious circle, however the patient entered the loop. Clinically, this approach may explain examples of dry eye syndrome occurring after ocular surgery, contact lens wear, chronic allergy or systemic or topical drugs, and the long-lasting effect even though all causal factors have been removed or have disappeared. This model should be considered as a basis for further reflection on biological mechanisms that could be even more complex but individually constitute potential leads for targeting therapeutic strategies to allow patients to leave the loop even though the triggering factors are still present or can only be attenuated, such as in Sjögren syndrome or ocular rosacea. It also should be considered a complement to more classic etiological and severity classifications aimed at understanding and classifying the large number of diseases that may cause dry eye disease and better assessing the major impairment it causes on the patient's quality of life."
CD009647,0,16638480,0,Oral health protocol for the dependent institutionalized elderly.,"Establishing an oral hygiene protocol for the frail and functionally dependent elderly should be of special concern to health care providers. The previous assessment of a care center, including patients or residents and staff, allows an effective strategy to be designed. Oral health protocols are mainly based on the daily removal of bacterial plaque from teeth or prostheses (or both), cleaning of oral mucosa, and continual oral hydration. These practices are facilitated by the use of electric toothbrushes and products such as chlorhexidine, fluoride toothpastes, and rinses or gels for dry mouth. This type of protocol should include regular collaboration with dental professionals and provide a program of continuous training for nursing staff on oral health issues."
CD009647,0,20427959,0,How to manage cardiorenal syndromes in the emergency room.,"In the emergency department (ED) a prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment for all diseases improve a patient's outcome. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as an abrupt deficiency of renal function over a period of hours to days resulting in a failure of the kidney to excrete nitrogenous waste products and to maintain fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. AKI diagnosis could be very challenging for ED physicians because it is often very difficult to obtain some anamnestic data such as daily urine output or a preexisting value of BUN and serum creatinine. The incidence of AKI is progressively increasing in EDs and the mortality rates of these patients range from 50 to 80% in multiorgan failure. For ED physicians it is also crucial to distinguish AKI from prerenal azotemia (volume depletion promptly resolved through administration of fluids) at the time of patient presentation. Moreover, a rapid diagnosis of AKI leads to stop the progressive kidney damage on the basis of an appropriate therapeutic approach. Recent studies have demonstrated that by using a new biomarker, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), it is possible to obtain an accurate and fast diagnosis of AKI. It is well known that in patients with cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, coronary artery diseases and congestive heart failure, high levels of creatinine are strictly related to a higher mortality. In the ED the occurrence of AKI in patients with acute worsening of cardiac function like acute decompensated heart failure is very common. Moreover, managing acute heart failure strictly depends on renal function. Therefore, a multimarker approach including NGAL+BNP (today easily obtained by a POCT system) could have a tremendous impact on an appropriate diagnosis, treatment and a supposed better patient outcome. Furthermore, an evaluation of total body fluid content is of great utility. We propose a new model of management for ED patients with cardiorenal syndromes using a multimarker approach and non-invasive evaluation of body fluid content by bioelectrical impedance vector analysis."

The aim of the study was to determine IgG antibody reactivity directed to six antigen regions of HCV in oral fluid and to evaluate the significance of the antibody pattern in oral fluid compared to serum. Oral fluid and serum samples of 32 HCV viremic patients were collected to detect antibodies to six antigen regions incorporated as antigen bands into modified commercial updated third generation line immuno-assay. Compared to serum, a significantly lower cumulative antibody response and reactivity to five HCV antigens was found in oral fluid. The significantly highest prevalence of oral fluid reactivity was recorded with antigen C1 (78%), whereas in serum the most significantly frequent reactivity was detected with antigen NS3 (100%). The absence of antibody reactivity with antigen E2 was similar in both body fluids. The discrepancy in antibody pattern to HCV antigens between oral fluid and serum indicates the possible existence of local viral replication, viral mutants, viral inhibitors in oral cavity and, most probably, leakage of the muco-vascular barrier."

The fixed low-dose combination of perindopril 2mg with indapamide 0.625mg combines an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a non-thiazide diuretic. Coadministration of perindopril and indapamide did not have any clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetic profile of either agent in healthy volunteers. In experimental models of hypertension, perindopril/indapamide restored endothelial function, improved microvascular density, reduced left ventricular and aortic hypertrophy, and reversed renal end-organ damage. Once daily oral perindopril 2mg/indapamide 0.625mg normalised blood pressure (BP) in 83.6% of elderly patients with essential hypertension (diastolic BP was reduced to < or =90mm Hg) and 81.7% of those with isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP was reduced to <160mm Hg) after approximately 1 year of treatment. BP normalisation was sustained in 79.8% of patients throughout the study. Fixed low-dose perindopril/indapamide had a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo in clinical trials; most adverse events were of mild to moderate severity.

CD009647,0,7204718,0,Dialysis-induced changes in muscle strength.,"Little is known about the acute effects of hemodialysis on muscle strength. Rapid changes in hemodynamic and biochemical parameters are known to occur during dialysis and may alter muscle performance. Ten patients maintained on chronic hemodialysis had measurements of quadriceps muscle and handgrip strength performed before and after dialysis. In seven of these patients maximum static inspiratory and expiratory pressures (PI max and PE max respectively) were similarly determined. Quadriceps muscle strength improved in 6 patients, decreased in 3 and remained unchanged in 1. Handgrip strength increased in 5 patients, decreased in 3, and remained unchanged in 1. PI max decreased in 6 patients and increased in 1, and PE max decreased in 4 patients and increased in 3. No significant correlation was found between the changes in strength of the tested muscle groups and the serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, urea nitrogen, and creatinine, changes in blood pressure of fluid balance. The dialysis-induced changes in biochemical parameters may exert opposing effects on neuromuscular performance. This may explain the diversity of the results obtained in this study."

CD009647,0,22099743,0,The relationship between glutathione peroxidase and bioimpedance parameters in nondiabetic hemodialysis patients.,"There is growing evidence from experimental and clinical studies that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of malnutrition. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels as a marker of antioxidant status and the nutritional status assessed by bioimpedance analysis (BIA). Ninety-seven nondiabetic stable outpatient uremic adults undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD) were recruited for this study. Impedance measurements were performed using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer after dialysis. GPx levels correlated with intracellular water (ICW) (r = 0.341, P = 0.011), ICW/total body weight (r = 0.320, P = 0.017), lean body mass (r = 0.300, P = 0.026) and total body cell mass (r = 0.339, P = 0.011). When patients were divided into two groups according to mean GPx levels (83.9 U/gr hemoglobin), the patients with higher GPx (GPx > 83.9 U/gr hemoglobin) had higher albumin (P = 0.038), lean body mass (P = 0.026), ICW (P = 0.011), and total body cell mass (P = 0.011) compared with those with lower GPx (GPx ≤ 83.9 U/gr hemoglobin). Furthermore, in the patients with higher GPx, body fat; extracellular water/total body water; illness marker and body fat mass index were lower than other group. In conclusion, our results reveal correlation indicating a relationship between antioxidant status (as measured by GPx) and nutritional status as assessed by BIA in nondiabetic HD patients."

To determine TRALI incidence by prospective, active surveillance and to identify risk factors by a case-control study, 2 academic medical centers enrolled 89 cases and 164 transfused controls. Recipient risk factors identified by multivariate analysis were higher IL-8 levels, liver surgery, chronic alcohol abuse, shock, higher peak airway pressure while being mechanically ventilated, current smoking, and positive fluid balance. Transfusion risk factors were receipt of plasma or whole blood from female donors (odds ratio = 4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-11.2, P = .001), volume of HLA class II antibody with normalized background ratio more than 27.5 (OR = 1.92/100 mL, 95% CI, 1.08-3.4, P = .03), and volume of anti-human neutrophil antigen positive by granulocyte immunofluoresence test (OR = 1.71/100 mL, 95% CI, 1.18-2.5, P = .004). Little or no risk was associated with older red blood cell units, noncognate or weak cognate class II antibody, or class I antibody.

Weight loss during dialysis was assumed to be water loss. Predicted total body water (TBW) from impedance after dialysis did not differ significantly from TBW determined by deuterium oxide dilution. However, the predicted change in TBW from bioelectrical impedance largely exceeded the observed weight (water) loss. The predicted change in extracellular water was slightly but significantly lower compared to the observed weight loss. The ratio of impedance at 1-100 kHz increased in all subjects during dialysis, and may be a simple tool to assess body water distribution."

Congestive heart failure was well controlled in both of those treatment groups. There was only one patient (FUR/P-group) whose daily dose had to be increased. According their own evaluation the patients tolerated the A/HCTH combination (48%) better than the FUR/P combination (30%). In the A/HCTH-group one clinically significant case of hypokalaemia was found which caused the therapy to be stopped. In the FUR/P-group two patients discontinued the treatment because of clinical side effects. In the long-term therapy of congestive heart failure hydrochlorothiazide together with potassium-sparing amiloride is a pleasant and effective therapy for patients with normal renal function, but the risk of hypokalaemia must be kept in mind also when using this combination."
CD009647,0,11398591,0,[Measurement of fluid compartments using electrical bioimpedance for assessment of target weight in hemodialysis patients].,"The prescription of optimal hydration status in hemodialysis patients remains a much disputed topic in dialysis treatment. In particular, assessment of the patients optimal weight (""target weight"") poses considerable difficulties. Multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy analysis (BIS) has been recommended as a non invasive, practical, and relatively non expensive method to determine hydration and nutritional status in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). In the current study we used whole body BIS analysis for determination of body water (BW) compartments; total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW), and intracellular water (ICW) in 133 healthy adults, and in 227 hemodialysis patients with end-stage renal disease. BIS results were compared to anthropometric measurements. Our results showed strong correlation between TBW measured by BIS in control group in comparison to anthropometric calculation (p = 0.001). In HD patients we observed higher range of TBW, and TBW/ECW ratio (from 15.6 to 56.1 L and from 0.33 to 0.78), as measured by BIS at pre-HD, and also post-HD period (TBW ranged from 13.1 to 56.2 L, ECW/TBW ratio ranged from 0.33 to 1.27). The TBW BIS results did not correlate with anthropometric calculation. We postulate using of multi-frequency bioimpedance technique in precise determination of fluid compartments and in consequence in the assessment of ""target weight"" in hemodialysis population."

CD009647,0,10892634,0,Hyponatremia and hypernatremia in the elderly.,"Management of abnormalities in water homeostasis is frequently challenging. Because age-related changes and chronic diseases are often associated with impairment of water metabolism in elderly patients, it is absolutely essential for clinicians to be aware of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in the elderly. The sensation of thirst, renal function, concentrating abilities and hormonal modulators of salt and water balance are often impaired in the elderly, which makes such patients highly susceptible to morbid and iatrogenic events involving salt and water. Clinicians should use a systematic approach in evaluating water and sodium problems, utilizing a comprehensive history and physical examination, and a few directed laboratory tests to make the clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, clinicians should have a clear appreciation of the roles that iatrogenic interventions and lapses in nutrition and nursing care frequently play in upsetting the homeostatic balance in elderly patients, particularly those who are in longterm institutional and inpatient settings."
CD009647,0,21896142,0,Thiazide and loop diuretics.,"KEY POINTS AND PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: •  Although chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide are structurally similar, they are very different pharmacokinetically, with chlorthalidone having both an extremely long half-life (approximately 40 to 60 hours) and a large volume of distribution, with gradual elimination from the plasma compartment by tubular secretion. •  Furosemide usage, the most widely used diuretic in the loop diuretic class, can be complicated by extremely erratic absorption, with a bioavailability range of 12% to 112%. •  Chlorthalidone, at a dose of 25 mg, is comparatively more potent than 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, particularly as related to overnight blood pressure reduction. •  In ALLHAT, there was no difference among chlorthalidone, amlodipine, lisinopril, and doxazosin for the primary outcome or mortality. •  Secondary outcomes were similar except for a 38% higher rate of heart failure with amlodipine; a 10% higher rate of combined cardiovascular disease, a 15% higher rate of stroke, and a 19% higher rate of heart failure with lisinopril; and a 20% higher rate of cardiovascular disease, a 20% higher rate of stroke (40% higher rate in blacks), and an 80% higher rate of heart failure with doxazosin, compared with chlorthalidone. •  The ACCOMPLISH study may affect future practice guidelines as a result of its findings favoring the amlodipine/benazepril combination; however, the generalizability to patient populations with a lesser cardiovascular risk profile remains in question and the dose of hydrochlorothiazide was only 12.5 mg to 25 mg daily, which was a dose lower than that used in placebo-controlled trials using hydrochlorothiazide. •  Certain low-renin patient groups (eg, blacks, the elderly, and diabetics) as well as those who manifest the metabolic syndrome are commonly more responsive to thiazide-type diuretic therapy. •  Diuretics can be successfully combined with β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, centrally acting agents, and even calcium channel blockers. •  Although thiazide-type diuretics are among the best-tolerated antihypertensive agents in terms of symptomatic adverse effects, diuretic-related adverse side effects include those with established mechanisms (eg, such as electrolyte changes and/or metabolic abnormalities) and other side effects, which are less well understood mechanistically (eg, impotence), although the latter is not universally accepted as a diuretic-related side effect. •  Thiazide-induced hypokalemia is associated with increased blood glucose, and treatment of thiazide-induced hypokalemia may reverse glucose intolerance and possibly prevent diabetes. •  Thiazide-induced hyperuricemia occurs as a result of volume contraction and competition with uric acid for renal tubular secretion, but does not necessarily contraindicate using a thiazide, especially if a uric acid-lowering drug such as allopurinol is being used. •  Adverse interactions include the blunting of thiazide effects by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the potential to increase fatigue, lethargy, and increase in glucose when combined with β-blockers. •  Thiazide-type diuretics are useful first-line agents in the treatment of hypertension because they have been proven to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in systolic and diastolic forms of hypertension and do so at low cost. •  Loop diuretics should not be used as first-line therapy in hypertension since there are no outcome data with them. They should be reserved for conditions of clinically significant fluid overload (eg, heart failure and significant fluid retention with vasodilator drugs, such as minoxidil) or with advanced renal failure and can be combined with thiazide-type diuretics."
CD009647,0,12002704,0,ACE inhibition is superior to angiotensin receptor blockade for renography in renal artery stenosis.,"Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as well as angiotensin II receptor antagonists are able to prevent the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin II on the efferent renal vessels, which is believed to play an important role in renovascular hypertension. This effect is assumed to be essential for the demonstration of renovascular hypertension by captopril renography. In this study, renographic changes induced by captopril and the AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan were compared in patients with a high probability for renovascular hypertension. Twenty-five patients with 33 stenosed renal arteries (grade of stenosis >50%) and hypertension were studied. Captopril, valsartan and baseline renography were performed within 48 h using technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine. Blood pressure was monitored, plasma renin concentration before and after intervention was determined and urinary flow was estimated from the urinary output of the hydrated patients. Alterations in renographic curves after intervention were evaluated according to the Santa Fe consensus on ACE inhibitor renography. Captopril renography was positive, indicating renovascular hypertension, in 25 of the 33 stenosed vessels, whereas valsartan renography was positive in only ten. Blood pressure during captopril and valsartan renography was not different; reduction in blood pressure was the same after valsartan and captopril. Plasma renin concentration was comparable for valsartan and captopril studies, showing suppressed values after intervention in as many as 12 of the 25 patients. Urinary flow after valsartan was higher than after captopril (P<0.05). However, this difference could not explain the markedly higher sensitivity of captopril compared with valsartan in demonstrating renal artery stenosis. In 14 of the 25 patients, blood pressure response to revascularisation was monitored, showing a much better predictive value for captopril renography. It is concluded that captopril renography is much more sensitive than valsartan renography in detecting a clinically significant renal artery stenosis. Furthermore, our data suggest that other effects, such as that on the prostaglandin-bradykinin system, are of at least similar importance to ACE inhibition for the high diagnostic sensitivity of captopril renography regarding renovascular hypertension."

Diseases identified in these subjects were sequelae of cerebrovascular disease (38 subjects), heart disease (22 subjects), hypertension (9 subjects), senile dementia (6 subjects), Parkinson's disease (5 subjects), malignant disease (3 subjects) and diabetes mellitus (2 subjects). They were initially divided into 2 groups according to ultrasonic cardiography: a normal group comprising 20 patients without cardiovascular abnormalities, and a disorder group comprising 18 patients with reduction of left ventricule function, left ventricular hypertrophy and/or valvular disease (more than moderate). All subjects were examined with regard to age, weight, the nutrition index proposed by Onodera, activity of daily living (ADL), cardiac output, left ventricular ejection fraction, serum level of BUN and albumin etc. Moreover, the disorder group subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of heart failure occurring after surgery. In addition to the above-mentioned, we also studied the duration of surgery and anesthesia, and water balance during and after surgery. Results showed that the ADL and nutrition index in the disorder group were lower compared to the normal group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009647,0,19473591,0,Pharmacotherapy guidelines for the aged by family doctors for the use of family doctors: Part D Basic conditions supporting drug treatment.,"Physiological changes in old age: loss of muscle mass; reduction in bone mass; percentage of fat increased; lower amount of body water; lack of thirst; diminishing kidney function (caution: sufficient intake of fluids: 1.5-2 l and moderate intake of protein 8 g/kg body weight); reduced secretion of digestive enzymes, delayed emptying of stomach (which means premature feeling of repletion). Lack of fluids and nutrition is therefore likely. Daily intake of 1,500 kcal and 1.5-2 l fluids is necessary. An indicator for malnutrition is low body weight (defined for persons older than 65 years of age as BMI < 20) and a protein serum concentration < 35 g/l. Malnutrition carries an increased risk of infections, falling and fractures, bed sores, anemia, decompensation of chronic diseases. 10-20% of subjects over 80 years of age show signs of malnutrition, 40-60% of subjects in care institutions or hospitals. There are regressive changes in the locomotor and the nervous system of the elderly which have an effect on physical fitness. These changes reduce strength, endurance, proprioceptive capacity (e.g. coordination, balance) and mobility. Exercise in the old and very old should increase skeletal muscle strength in particular and improve coordination and balance. Regular physical exercise and moderate training has a positive effect on mobility and thereby improves independence and reduces falls. Moreover, it has a positive effect on cardiac output, maximum heart rate, stroke volume and the risk of a cardiovascular event and mortality can be reduced. Moreover, moderate physical exercise is often more effective in treating chronic disease than drug therapy e.g. heart failure, coronary heart disease, asthma/COPD, stroke, diabetes mellitus Type 2, degenerative diseases of the joints, depression and others. Examine cardiovascular risks in persons over the age of 50 before beginning physical exercise. Avoid maximum stress levels."
CD009647,0,15359357,0,Validity of measuring knee-height as an estimate of height in diseased French elderly persons.,"Body mass index is a tool to screen undernourished persons. Cut-off values of 22 or 24 kg/m2 are used for elderly persons. However, standing height cannot be measured in every elderly person. Knee-height has been proposed to estimate standing height, with equations derived from North-American people. The present study analyses the validity of these equations. Standing height and knee-height were measured in 126 elderly persons hospitalized in 6 French geriatrics wards. Consequences of using one of the either height was evaluated on body mass index, body surface area, and total body water as estimated from bioelectrical impedance measurements. Standing height and height derived from knee-height differed significantly by 0.9 cm (P=0.05). This has very limited consequences on the calculation of BMI (0.5 kg/m2), body surface area (0.04 m2) and on total body water (0.2 litres). A regression model was derived from covariates and found the same features as that in the model of Chumlea and Guo. In conclusion, knee-height can be used with sufficient accuracy as a surrogate for standing height in diseased French elderly persons."

ANP has previously been localized in neurons of the rat brain in regions subserving cardiovascular functions and fluid/electrolyte balance and has been localized in astroglia of the canine brain. To determine whether ANP is present in astrocytes of the human brain and to validate the canine model for future studies, human brain tissue was obtained from autopsy cases with no brain damage or neurological or vascular disease. Human brains were obtained less than 3 h postmortem, and anterior cingulate and striate cortices were dissected following perfusion or immersion fixation. Immunohistochemical processing utilized antibodies against the processed form of ANP (ANP IV, ANP104-128) and against rat proANP (amino terminus) and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. Isolated, strongly ANP-immunoreactive protoplasmic astrocytes were observed in all layers of the cingulate and striate cortex gray matter. ANP-positive fibrous astrocytes were observed in the white matter. Additionally, distinctive immunopositive astrocytes were found both within and immediately subjacent to the glia limitans. Antibody against the prohormone stained only protoplasmic astrocytes and sublimitans astrocytes and processes. In addition to the astroglia, ANP was detected in scattered multipolar neurons in the cerebral gray matter. These results provide additional evidence for diversity of peptide localization in astrocytes and suggest roles for ANP in the local regulation of cerebral blood flow, blood-brain barrier permeability, or cerebrospinal fluid volume."
CD009647,0,21594682,0,Early and personalized ambulatory follow-up to tailor furosemide and fluid intake according to congestion in post-discharge heart failure.,"Congestive heart failure (CHF) worsening is a worldwide cause of rehospitalization and mortality, specially during the early period after hospitalization. Fluid accumulation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of both acute heart decompensation and disease progression. The effective use of drugs to maintain restored clinical stabilization in recently discharged patients is a difficult task, and it relies on matching the most appropriately tailored therapy to specific clinical profiles. However, no successful treatment has been shown to reduce post-discharge readmission. We evaluated in a case-control study the effectiveness of an early and personalized congestion-guided ambulatory program on medium-term (6 months) compensation in recently discharged CHF patients. Group A (22 patients) underwent a post-discharge close follow-up consisting of: an early clinic visit within 10 days; a second visit within 10 days after the first; and the other visits at month 1, 2, 3 after discharge. Controls (Group B, 21 patients) underwent a conventional ambulatory follow-up only at month 1, 2, 3 after discharge. The ambulatory approach in both groups was based on the monitoring of signs/symptoms of congestion and body weight, body hydration estimation by using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and laboratory data. This assessment was finalized to tailor furosemide and daily fluid intake at each visit to eliminate clinical or instrumental evidence of persistent congestion relieving the signs and symptoms. At 6 months, Group A was associated with a better clinical compensation (improved hydration state, lower BNP levels and congestion score), an improved quality of life, and reduced re-hospitalizations. We conclude that in CHF the early and personalized ambulatory follow-up based on congestion-guided treatment is effective to optimize management and maintain clinical stability in the post-discharge period."

Changes in plasma volume (PV) and extracellular volume (ECV) were calculated from determinations of fluid volumes before and after hemodialysis, using 125I-albumin and 51Cr EDTA respectively. Reduction in body water was estimated from body weight changes. Weight loss was 3.3 +/- 0.3 kg (range 1.8-6.0 kg). The relative reduction of fluid was greater in the ECV, 21.6 +/- 3.2%, compared to plasma volume, 6.9 +/- 1.8%. The reduction in systolic blood pressure was related to both absolute (r = 0.66, p less than 0.05) and relative PV reduction (r = 0.72, p less than 0.02). There was no correlation between blood pressure reduction and weight loss or ECV changes. Only minor alterations were found in diastolic blood pressure. Plasma volume maintenance relates to blood pressure changes. Plasma volume monitoring could be useful for improving intradialytic hemodynamic control."

A 76 year-old male patient with diabetes on treatment with metformin, hypertension, dyslipaemia, and with mild cognitive impairment, was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in a state of circulatory shock, requiring aggressive treatment with vasopressors and volume. The patient had acute kidney injury with an anuria of 3 days, probably secondary to dehydration to vomiting and to NSAIDs. As a result of the acute renal damage, the patient suffered a severe metformin-associated lactic acidosis. The rest of the causes of metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap were ruled out, as well as a possible sepsis or rhabdomyolysis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is an uncommon metabolic condition, but with a high mortality. To reduce the mortality of these patients, it is important to make an early diagnosis using the clinical records, physical examination, and laboratory tests, with an early resuscitation with volume, vasopressors, bicarbonate, and renal replacement therapy."

It was demonstrated that 10 mg xipamide (a long-acting diuretic) given daily had no deleterious effect on flow property, while 20 mg daily produced a haemoconcentration which negatively affected it, apparently in relation to the urine volume excreted per unit time. At higher dosages the effect on blood flow properties was shifted in time, which indicates that the increased diuresis in the first day leads to a cumulative effect on the flow properties of the blood. Erythrocyte deformability was not affected. It is possible that combined preparations which contain a diuretic should be specially examined with respect to any undesirable effect on flow properties of the blood."

CD009647,0,8366983,0,"Salt wastage, plasma volume contraction and hypokalemic paralysis in self-induced water intoxication.","Eleven episodes of severe hyponatremia secondary to hiccup-induced potomania were recorded in 3 years in a man who had essential hypertension, a low protein intake and a normal diluting ability. Paradoxical increase in hematocrit and plasma protein with acute extensive natriuresis was associated as well as urine potassium loss and hypokalemia producing paralysis in 1 episode. During a chronic water loading test, the defect in water excretion was related to a low urine solute delivery which was partially reverted by the natriuretic response to plasma volume expansion, promoting water diuresis. In acute water intoxication, this natriuretic response was exaggerated, producing a brisk water diuresis. Plasma volume was rapidly normalized but without any improvement in plasma sodium due to the concomitant negative sodium balance. Thus, water diuresis persisted until plasma volume was significantly contracted. Potassium loss appeared to be related to sodium excretion. Metabolic disturbances have not reoccurred despite persistent hiccup and potomania during 2 years of urea therapy."
CD009647,0,6472364,1,Reduced thirst after water deprivation in healthy elderly men.,"To determine whether responses to dehydration are altered with age, we investigated the thirst, fluid and electrolyte responses, and hormonal responses to 24 hours of water deprivation in seven healthy active elderly men (67 to 75 years old) and seven healthy young men (20 to 31 years old) who were matched for weight loss during water deprivation. After water deprivation, the older men had greater increases in plasma osmolality, sodium concentration, and vasopressin levels. However, their urinary osmolality was lower and they were less thirsty and drank less after water deprivation, so that their plasma and urine were not diluted to predeprivation levels. Regression analysis indicated increased sensitivity of vasopressin osmoreceptors in the older group, although this difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that after 24 hours of water deprivation, there is a deficit in thirst and water intake in healthy elderly men, as compared with younger men, although vasopressin osmoreceptor responsiveness is maintained or even increased. Our findings also suggest that the well-known deficit in urinary concentrating ability that occurs with age reflects renal causes and not a lack of circulating vasopressin."

The objective was to examine effects of weight loss as achieved through energy restriction upon human in vivo cholesterol biosynthesis. Six subjects (64-77 y, body mass index, 30.3 +/- 3.8 kg/m(2)) were recruited into a two-phase prospective clinical trial. In the first phase, subjects complied with American Heart Association (AHA) Step I diets for 3 mo with no change in their usual energy intake. After this weight-stable phase, subjects consumed an AHA Step I diet with a targeted reduction in energy intake of approximately 1000 kJ/d for 6 mo to achieve negative energy balance leading to weight loss. The incorporation rate of deuterium from body water into erythrocyte membrane free cholesterol over 24 h was utilized as an index of cholesterogenesis at the end of both phases. Subjects' mean weights decreased (P < 0.05) from 89.3 +/- 12.5 kg to 83.2 +/- 11.5 kg (6.8 +/- 2.6% of initial body weight) across phases. Circulating concentrations of total and LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides also decreased (P < 0. 05) across phases. HDL-cholesterol concentrations were unchanged (P > 0.05). Cholesterol fractional synthetic rate (FSR) after phase 2 (3.04 +/- 1.90%/d) was lower (P < 0.05) than that after phase 1 (8. 42 +/- 3.90%/d). Absolute synthesis rate (ASR) after phase 2 [0.59 +/- 0.38 g/(kg. d)] also was lower (P < 0.05) than that after phase 1 [1.66 +/- 0.84 g/(kg. d)]. These data suggest that, in obese men, energy restriction resulting in even modest weight loss suppresses endogenous cholesterol synthesis, which contributes to a decline in circulating lipid concentrations."

Two groups of clinically stable hemodialyzed patients with residual diuresis minimally 500 ml of urine per day were studied. The patients from the first group were given iso-osmolal contrast agent iodixanol (Visipaque, GE Healthcare, United Kingdom) in concentration of iodine 320 mg/ml with osmolality 290 mOsm/kg of water during the endovascular procedure. The second control group was followed without contrast medium administered. Residual diuresis and residual renal excretory capacity expressed as 24-h calculated creatinine clearance were evaluated in the both groups after 6 months. The evaluated group included 42 patients who were given 99.3 ml of iodixanol in average (range, 60-180 ml). The control group included 45 patients. There was no statistically significant difference found between both groups in daily volume of urine (P = 0.855) and calculated clearance of creatinine (P = 0.573). We can conclude that residual diuresis is not significantly influenced by intravascular administration of iso-osmolal iodinated contrast agent (iodixanol) in range of volume from 60 to 180 ml in comparison to natural course of urinary output and residual renal function during end-stage renal disease. This result can help the nephrologist to decide which imaging method/contrast medium to use in dialyzed patients in current practice."

Fluid challenge consisted of 250 ml of test fluid every 15 min until the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (WP) reached 15 mm Hg. Thereafter, WP was maintained at 15 mm Hg for an additional 24 h with infusions of the same test fluid. Vital signs, hemodynamic and respiratory variables, as well as arterial lactate and colloid osmotic pressure (COP) were monitored according to protocol. Chest x-rays were performed by standardized technique before fluid challenge and at 12 and 24 h of maintenance fluid therapy and were evaluated for evidence of pulmonary edema. Cardiac function and hemodynamic stability were restored by fluid challenge with A, H, and S. Two to 4 times the volume of S as A or H was required to achieve similar hemodynamic endpoints. COP was increased by fluid challenge with A or H but was markedly reduced by fluid challenge with S and throughout the 24-h maintenance period. Fluid challenge resulted in reductions in COP-WP gradient of 62% in the A, 43% in the H, and 125% in the S groups. Resuscitation with S resulted in a significantly higher incidence of pulmonary edema (87.5%) than did resuscitation with A (22%) or H (22%). Urine output was not different among the groups at any time during the study. We conclude that 6% H performs as well as 5% A as a resuscitative fluid and that resuscitation with either of these colloids is associated with a lower incidence of pulmonary edema than is resuscitation with 0.9% S."
CD009647,0,2943143,0,Antidiuretic hormone and atrial natriuretic peptide in congestive heart failure.,"Plasma concentrations of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) were measured in 8 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) of NYHA functional class III-IV, before and during treatment with captopril, 6.25-25.0 mg t.i.d., added to their drug regimen. Before captopril treatment, plasma ADH was high, 2.5 times the upper limit of normal reference values. During treatment with captopril, plasma ADH levels were normalized, and remained so throughout the study, for at least 6 months. Plasma levels of angiotensin II were also reduced to a normal level. Reduction of plasma ADH during captopril treatment in CHF may partly depend on reduced angiotensin II formation, and may be beneficial by improving water balance. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), was measured by radioimmunoassay in 17 patients with CHF. The highest levels were measured in the most severe CHF cases, and intermediate high values on NYHA functional class I-II patients. Plasma ANP concentrations in control patients (n = 18) without cardiac diseases ranged between 0 and 30 pg/ml. In two patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, associated with transient polyuria, high plasma ANP concentrations were noticed during tachycardic episodes. Thus, ANP appears to be a circulating hormone in humans, and is released into the blood in clinical conditions associated with raised preload and atrial wall stretch."

CD009647,0,9697878,0,Adjuvant treatment with cyclosporin A increases the toxicity of chemotherapy for remission induction in acute non-lymphocytic leukemia.,"P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-related multidrug resistance (MDR) is frequently observed in acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and is associated with a poor response to standard chemotherapy. Cyclosporin A (CsA) is an effective downmodulator of Pgp-related MDR in vitro and has already been tested for that purpose in vivo also. Since Pgp is expressed in several normal cells and tissues, the modulation of Pgp can also modify total body exposure to antileukemic drugs and can alter and increase the toxicity of the antileukemic treatment. We report here the results of a study where 46 consecutive adult patients with ANLL were assigned to receive the same standard chemotherapy regimen of arabinosyl cytosine and idarubicin (IDA) for remission induction or consolidation, without or with CsA. Twenty-eight patients received 36 courses of chemotherapy without CsA and 18 patients received 32 courses of chemotherapy with CsA. CsA dose was 10-12.5 mg/kg/day and was given as a continuous i.v. infusion for 72 h. Whole blood CsA steady-state concentration ranged between 0.61 and 1.14 microM. The IDA area-under-the-curve was about twice as high in the cases that received CsA than in the other cases. CsA had no detectable effects on renal function and fluid balance, but significantly increased systemic blood diastolic pressure and conjugated bilirubine concentration. Furthermore, CsA-treated patients had greater, and more severe, oral and intestinal mucosal toxicity, with more severe adverse events, including more cases of gram-negative bacteremia, and with a delayed hemopoietic recovery. In conclusion, this study showed that an attempt at an effective downmodulation of Pgp-mediated MDR would substantially increase the hemopoietic and mucosal toxicity of antileukemic treatment and that the increase is accounted for, at least in part, by an increase of total body exposure to IDA."

In addition, early mental status changes often occur as a result of virusencephalitis, beside focal neurological deficiencies, epileptic seizures, cerebral compression, even coma. Other pathological manifestations of virusencephalitis are disturbances of the neurohumoral and the endocrine system, which are often recognised and treated too late. This case report describes symptoms, treatment, and complications of a 76 year old female in-patient, who was diagnosed with virusencephalitis. The number of lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid was increased to 30 cells per microliter, liquor albumin was 1705 mg/l, liquor sugar was 53 mg/dl and liquor lactat was 1.9 mmol/l. IgM antibodies against herpes viruses were found in the cerebrospinal fluid and distinct contrasting foci were found near the mammillary bodies, hypothalamus, tractus opticus, hypophyseal stalk and right parahippocampal in the magnetic resonance imaging of the head, indicating a focal herpes simplex encephalitis. Within seven days, the following symptoms developed: akinetic parkinsonian syndrome, central diabetes insipidus with hypernatremia and polyuria (6 l/die), hypothyreosis, adrenal insufficiency with adynamia, sopor, hypotension and even hypophyseal coma. Panhypopituitarism was diagnosed after measuring the basal hormone levels (ACTH, TSH, FT3, FT4, Cortisol, Prolactin, LH, FSH, ADH) and conducting the pituitary stimulation test. The severeness of all symptoms was slightly improved after substitution with antidiuretic hormone at 0.4 microgram/die and administration of hydrocortisone at 50 mg/die. Administration of amantadine sulphate at 0.6 g/die and L-dopa at 187.5 mg/die for 14 days resulted in a complete regression of the parkinsonism. After administration of aciclovir at 2.25 g/die for 21 days a complete regression of the clinical symptoms could be reached in connection with a decrease of 90% in number and size of cerebral contrasting foci in the magnetic resonance imaging of the head. Three month after therapy, clinical examination and blood serum analysis revealed persistent panhypopituitarism. The present case report is the first description of a viral infection on of the central nervous system (CNS) in combination with parkinsonism, diabetes insipidus, persistent panhypopituitarism and hyperprolactinemia. Early treatment of viral infections of the brain can improve a patient's prognosis dramatically. Early determination and early treatment of a patient's neurohumoral parameters is therefore critical to prevent or reverse early mental status changes like attention disturbances, alterations of personality and behavior, apathy, and slowed cognition."
CD009647,0,7871935,0,Physiopathology of hypernatremia following relief of urinary tract obstruction.,"We report a case of postobstructive hypernatremia, and illustrate its pathogenesis and treatment. Physicians should be aware of this condition, given its high mortality rate (up to 70%), the high prevalence of potentially obstructive prostatic disease in elderly people and the peculiar sensitivity of this age group to disorders of osmotic regulation. Knowledge of the processes involved in osmoregulation has provided insights into the pathogenesis of this condition, which includes at least three factors: (i) decreased efficacy of the thirst mechanism in elderly patients, (ii) water loss in excess of effective solutes, resulting from osmotic diuresis from urea and transient renal tubular unresponsiveness to antidiuretic hormone, and (iii) inadequate fluid administration and failure to induce a positive fluid balance. These insights led to the development of specific strategies aimed at adequate correction of hypernatremia. Initial therapy should be rapid infusion of normal saline (or half-normal saline) coupled to administration of free water to restore euvolemia and correct hypernatremia, relying on repeated calculations of the free water deficit and taking into account ongoing urinary and insensible losses."

CD009647,0,23406891,0,Early inhibition of natriuresis suppresses symptomatic cerebral vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Hyponatremia is a common complication occurring in one third of patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). One mechanism that likely mediates the development of hyponatremia in SAH is cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSWS), which induces natriuresis and reduces total blood volume, resulting in a risk of symptomatic vasospasm (SVS). The mineral corticoid fludrocortisone acetate enhances sodium reabsorption in the renal distal tubules and may help prevent post-SAH hyponatremia. However, management with fludrocortisone acetate is ineffective if hyponatremia is advanced, because CSWS and subsequent SVS develop rapidly. Therefore, an additional earlier marker is required to predict the development of hyponatremia for the initiation of immediate treatment in select patients. However, no conclusive evidence exists showing that hyponatremia influences the risk of SVS, and no standard treatment protocol exists for treating hyponatremia in patients with SAH. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether selective early treatment of hyponatremia prevents SVS in patients with increased urinary sodium excretion in the early phase following SAH."

These characteristics result in enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis, faster renal elimination (initial intravascular half-life = 2.5 versus 25.5 hours), and less effect on coagulation. We report on a randomized clinical trial comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of 10% pentastarch (group P) for plasma volume expansion after cardiac operations with that of 5% serum albumin (group A). During the first 24 hours after arrival of the patient in the intensive care unit, colloid was infused to maintain a cardiac index of 2.0 L/m2 or more and a mean arterial pressure within 10% of the preinduction value. Group P (n = 50) received 1706 +/- 393 ml of colloid (mean +/- standard deviation) during this period, and group A (n = 44), 1794 +/- 341 ml (p = no significant difference). Hemodynamic responses to infusion were similar for both groups, although in group P a greater increase in both cardiac index (0.5 +/- 0.5 versus 0.3 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2 in group A, p less than 0.01) and left ventricular stroke work index (10.8 +/- 8.0 versus 5.8 +/- 6.0 gm-m/m2, p less than 0.01) was observed during infusion of the first 500 ml. There were no significant differences in any of the measured respiratory parameters (alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, estimated shunt fraction, and effective pulmonary compliance). Hemodilution with colloid significantly reduced serum protein levels in group P by 24 hours postoperatively (4.0 +/- 0.6 versus 5.0 +/- 0.7 gm/dl in group A, p less than 0.05), although mean serum colloid osmotic pressure was similar (15.4 +/- 2.6 [P] versus 15.5 +/- 2.7 mmHg [A], p = no significant difference). There were no significant between-group differences in prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, bleeding time, or coagulation factors (fibrinogen, V, VII, VIII, or IX) on postoperative days 1 and 7. Perioperative fluid balance, weight change, chest tube output, red blood, platelet, or fresh frozen plasma usage, reexploration for bleeding, and clinical outcome were also similar. These findings indicate that pentastarch is as safe and effective s 5% albumin for plasma volume expansion after cardiac operations with no apparent adverse effects on coagulation. If commercially available at a lower cost than albumin, it would appear to be a reasonable first choice for colloid therapy in this setting."

Total (dialysis and kidney) mean weekly values for creatinine clearance (Ccr), Kt/V, and beta2 microglobulin (beta2MG) clearance were 56 L/1.75 m(2), 1.80, and 11 L/1.73 m(2), respectively. Fifty percent of the patients who had no residual renal function (RRF) and 17% of the patients with RRF did not achieve 50 L/wk/1.73 m(2) of Ccr.

Mean daily protein loss was 5.8 g. Although a significant number of patients did not achieve 50 or 60 L/wk/1.73 m(2) of Ccr, the physicians determined that 72% of the patients received adequate dialysis and 71% were well nourished according to clinical and laboratory features. In conclusion, the daily prescribed volume and the delivered dialysis dose were lower than expected. The discrepancy between the actual delivered dialysis dose and the physicians' evaluation should be explored in the future."

CD009647,0,3288999,0,Characteristics and regulation of active transport in lungs from young and aged mammals.,"From the data presented here, it appears that the ability to stimulate solute (and water) clearance from the alveolar spaces may decrease with aging. This implies that the management of elderly patients with respiratory diseases or complications may necessitate a different approach than that useful in younger patients. Many of the active transport mechanisms well-characterized in other epithelia now seem to be important for maintaining the alveolar air spaces in their normally ""dry"" condition in the lungs of fetal and young, sexually mature mammals. In situations in which excess fluid is present in the air spaces of the lung, it is likely that the normal regulation of these active transport processes may play a major processes may play a major role in alveolar fluid clearance. Various exogenous agents may be helpful in stimulating the active solute and water reabsorption from air space to vascular space in both fetal and young sexually mature mammals. Further studies on the effects of aging on the characteristics and regulation of lung fluid balance are still needed."
CD009647,0,11901941,0,[Clinical thinking and decision making in daily practice. An elderly man with hyponatremia].,"An 88-year-old man presented with nausea and vomiting. Recently a cutaneous B-cell lymphoma had been diagnosed on his right cheek. Laboratory investigation showed hyponatraemia. Fluid restriction was started, based on the diagnosis of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). However the hyponatraemia persisted and a diagnosis of 'reset osmostat' was made. CT of the abdomen revealed slight bilateral adrenal enlargement, which was interpreted as adrenal incidentaloma. No other localisation of the lymphoma, besides that on the right cheek, was seen. Although the symptoms initially disappeared, they recurred and were quickly followed by hypotension. The patient died. Post-mortem examination showed bilateral destruction of the adrenal glands due to lymphoma. The correct diagnosis was Addison's disease. This case shows that diseases do not always present with all the classical symptoms, and that it is important to consider test characteristics of diagnostic tests and to judge investigations in the context of the other clinical findings."
CD009647,0,20817537,0,Traumatic interhemispheric subdural haematoma: Study of 35 cases.,"The clinical and radiological findings, management, and outcomes in 35 patients with traumatic interhemispheric subdural haematoma (ISH) were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-five patients had favourable outcomes and 10 had poor outcomes. All patients were treated conservatively for ISH. Univariate analysis found that the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (p < 0.001), hypovolemic shock (p = 0.018), skull fracture (p = 0.008), convexity or posterior fossa subdural haematoma (p = 0.008), and subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) were correlated with outcome (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that GCS score (p = 0.031; odds ratio [OR], 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-0.9) and the presence of SAH (p = 0.023; OR, 14.2; 95% CI, 1.5-138.2) were significantly related to poor outcome.

CD009647,0,22080394,0,Central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis associated with acute hepatic dysfunction.,"Central pontine myelinolysis and extrapontine myelinolysis are rare demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system. These diseases are related frequently to rapid correction of hyponatremia. They have also been described in association with other underlying conditions such as alcoholism and malnutrition. In the present study, we report a case of central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis with acute hepatic dysfunction. The patient had no apparent evidence of hyponatremia and no history of alcohol abuse. On admission, the patient was lethargic; dysphagia, dysarthria, and quadriplegia were noted. Laboratory examination showed significantly increased transaminase without hyponatremia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal signal intensities in the pons and thalamus. Consciousness level and clinical symptoms improved gradually within a week. We suggest that acute hepatic dysfunction may play an important role in the development of central pontine myelinolysis and extrapontine myelinolysis."

Effect on transepidermal water loss, stratum corneum hydration, skin surface pH, and casual sebum content.","This study investigates the effect of cutaneous aging on transepidermal water loss, stratum corneum hydration (capacitance), skin surface pH, and causal sebum content. Because the physiologic condition of skin varies considerably with anatomic region and skin aging might demonstrate regional variability, all factors were studied on 11 anatomic locations in 14 young adult (seven female and seven male subjects; 26.7 +/- 2.8 years [mean +/- SD]) and 15 aged human volunteers (seven female and seven male subjects; 70.5 +/- 13.8 years). Significant anatomic variability was noted for all factors in both age groups. However, no significant differences between the two groups were noted for sebum, capacitance, and pH on most anatomic regions. Transepidermal water loss, however, was significantly lower in the aged population on all anatomic regions tested, except for the postauricular region and the palm. Comparing male and female volunteers, none of the four factors showed significant differences. Of all measured factors, only transepidermal water loss showed significant age-related differences on most anatomic regions studied. The additionally observed differences between the age groups on the ankle for pH and sebum might be related to the stasis frequently observed on the lower limbs in aged individuals."
CD009647,0,9892337,0,Hypernatremia with edema.,"Hypernatremia is usually associated with water depletion. Seven very ill patients developed hypernatremia in association with marked edema during therapy in the hospital. All patients had hypoalbuminemia and azotemia. At the time of hypernatremia, urine output averaged 1880 mL/24 h and urine sodium concentration averaged 59 mmol/L, suggesting that low levels of antidiuretic hormone and/or a diminished effect of this hormone on the nephron may contribute to the pathophysiological mechanism of the hypernatremia. Recognition of this salt- and water-overloaded state should guide therapy."
CD009647,0,20404719,0,A novel bioimpedance technique to monitor fluid volume state during hemodialysis treatment.,"Bioimpedance spectroscopy is a potential candidate for monitoring of body fluids during dialysis. In this article, the suitability of knee-to-knee (KK) as an alternative to wrist-to-ankle (WA) bioimpedance spectroscopy measurements during dialysis is evaluated. Measurements on eight patients (22 dialysis sessions) showed a good correlation between the change in extracellular resistance (Re) in KK and WA measurements. A deeper analysis indicated that the change in Re normalized for ultrafiltrated volume [DeltaRe/UFV (%/L)] depends on the characteristics of the patient: clinically stable patients [with a presumed lower extracellular fluid - total body volume (VB) relationship] show a higher DeltaRe/UFV (%/L) mean +/- standard deviation (WA: 8.90 +/- 1.9 and KK: 8.29 +/- 2.2) than clinically unstable patients with pitting peripheral edema (WA: 2.10 +/- 0.8 and KK: 2.07 +/- 0.2). Simulations based on bioimpedance equations considering Hanai theory confirm the results. The KK method, especially in combination with proper use of the introduced DeltaRe/UFV (%/L) normalization could possibly offer new options for comfortable online monitoring and the evaluation of fluid volume state during dialysis."

CD009647,0,10701284,0,Confusion and aggression in restrained elderly persons undergoing hip repair surgery.,"The purpose of this pilot study was to observe and describe the behaviors of confusion and aggression in physically restrained elderly hospitalized persons following hip repair surgery. Five elderly persons who were 75-95 years of age and physically restrained following hip repair surgery comprised the sample of this descriptive study. Descriptive data including age, sex, medical diagnosis, current medications, serum electrolyte and arterial blood gas results, date/time of hip fracture, subsequent surgical repair, and restraint application were obtained from the medical record. Observations of behaviors associated with confusion and aggression were conducted at six separate observation times lasting approximately 20 to 30 minutes each. The observation periods were divided into two mornings, two afternoons, and two evening sessions. These behaviors were assessed by utilizing a combined observational tool developed by the researcher, and was created from the Clinical Assessment of Confusion--A, by Vermeersch, and Ryden Aggression Scale. After data analysis, three patterns of confusion emerged. These were the major pattern of confusion, the minor pattern of confusion, and pattern of confusion relative to time. All patients experienced low serum sodium levels immediately prior to the application of physical restraints. Based on the results of the pilot study, further investigation is needed."
CD009647,0,10356075,0,Fish oil-enriched nutritional supplement attenuates progression of the acute-phase response in weight-losing patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.,"The presence of an acute-phase protein response (APPR) has been suggested to shorten survival and contribute to weight loss in patients with pancreatic cancer. Fatty acids derived from fish oil have been shown to alter proinflammatory cytokine production and acute-phase protein synthesis in vitro. The present study was designed to determine the effects of a fish oil-enriched nutritional supplement on the concentrations of a range of individual acute-phase proteins (APP) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. In a sequential series, 18 patients with pancreatic cancer received the supplement (providing 2 g eicosapentaenoic acid and 1 g docosahexaenoic acid/d) for 3 wk while another 18 received full supportive care alone. Six healthy subjects served as additional controls. Acute-phase proteins were measured before and after the 3-wk intervention period in cancer patients. At baseline, albumin, transferrin and pre-albumin were significantly reduced and fibrinogen, haptoglobin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly elevated in the cancer patients compared with healthy controls, reflecting their roles as negative and positive acute phase proteins, respectively. In the supplemented cancer group, the only significant change in APP concentrations over the 4-wk study period was an increase in transferrin. In the control cancer group there were further significant reductions in albumin, transferrin and pre-albumin, and a significant increase in CRP concentration. These results suggest that many positive and negative APP are altered in advanced pancreatic cancer. The APPR tends to progress in untreated patients but may be stabilized by the administration of a fish oil-enriched nutritional supplement. This may have implications for reducing wasting in such patients."

CD009647,0,12433866,0,Delayed distribution of active vasodilation and altered vascular conductance in aged skin.,"Reflex vasodilation is attenuated in aged skin during hyperthermia. We used laser-Doppler imaging (LDI) to test the hypothesis that the magnitude of conductance and the spatial distribution of vasodilation are altered with aging. LDI of forearm skin was compared in 12 young (19- to 29-yr-old) and 12 older (64- to 75-yr-old) men during supine passive heating. Additionally, iontophoresis of bretylium tosylate was performed in a subset of subjects to explore the involvement of sympathetic vasoconstriction in limiting skin blood flow. Passive heating with water-perfused suits clamped mean skin temperature at 41.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C, causing a ramp increase in esophageal temperature (T(es)) to </=38.5 degrees C. LDI scans were performed at baseline and at every 0.2 degrees C increase in T(es). LDI at bretylium and control sites was identical, suggesting no influence of noradrenergic vasoconstriction. Forearm vascular conductance (venous occlusion plethysmography) was reduced in the older men (P </= 0.001) at every elevated T(es). Mean cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) of the scanned area was reduced in the older men at 0.2 degrees C </= DeltaT(es) </= 0.8 degrees C. Early in heating (0.2 degrees C </= DeltaT(es) </= 0.6 degrees C), older men also responded with a reduced vasodilated area (P </= 0.05), implying a slower recruitment or filling of skin microvessels. The results indicate that the area of vasodilation and CVC within the vasodilated area are reduced in aged skin during early passive heating, but only CVC is reduced at DeltaT(es) = 0.8 degrees C."
CD009647,0,23496346,0,Hyponatremia: an update on current pharmacotherapy.,"Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical practice, and it is associated with adverse outcomes. Severe hyponatremia can result in cerebral edema and hypoxia. Moreover, even mild hyponatremia can lead to gait instability and cognitive dysfunction, especially in the elderly. The main cause of hyponatremia is nonosmotic secretion of arginine vasopressin with resultant electrolyte-free water retention. Thus, the available management for chronic hyponatremia must increase solute-free water excretion, such as occurs with blocking vasopressin receptors with selective V2 antagonists."
CD009647,0,12369886,0,Pathological peptide folding in Alzheimer's disease and other conformational disorders.,"Main neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders are the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles consisting of abnormally phosphorylated protein tau and of senile plaques largely containing insoluble beta-amyloid peptides (A beta), containing up to 43 amino acid residues derived from the beta-amyloid precursor protein. Such A beta-sheets become visible by using suitable histochemical methods. Molecular simulation showed that the central, alpha-helical, lipophilic, antigenic folding domain of the A beta-peptide loop is a promising molecular target of beta-sheet breakers that thus prevent the polymerization of A beta into aggregates. It seems that di- and tetramers of A beta-peptides have a beta-barrel- like structure. In the present review, an optimized neural network analysis was applied to recognize possible structure-activity relationships of peptidomimetic beta-sheet breakers. The anti-aggregatory potency of beta-sheet breakers largely depends upon their total, electrostatic, and hydration energy as derived from their geometry-optimized conformations using the hybrid Gasteiger-molecular mechanics approach. Moreover, we also summarize peptide misfolding in several disorders with distinct clinical symptoms, including prion diseases and a broad variety of systemic amyloidoses, as the common pathogenic step driving these disorders. In particular, conversion of nontoxic alpha-helix/random-coils to beta-sheet conformation was recognized as being critical in producing highly pathogenic peptide assemblies. Whereas conventional pharmacotherapy of AD is mainly focused on restoring cholinergic activity and diminishing inflammatory responses as a consequence of amyloid accumulation, we here survey potential approaches aimed at preventing or reserving the transition of neurotoxic peptide species from alpha-helical/random coil to beta-sheet conformation and thus abrogating their effects in a broad variety of disorders."

CD009647,0,7486469,0,Nutritional issues in nursing home care.,"The most common nutritional problems in nursing home residents are weight loss and concomitant protein energy undernutrition. Although the causes of weight loss in these patients can usually be treated, they are rarely identified in the nursing home. Depression and adverse drug effects are the most common causes of weight loss. We discuss the appropriate use of feeding tubes in the nursing home and the early use of enteral feeding to prevent the development of severe protein energy undernutrition. Vitamin deficiencies, especially folate and pyridoxine deficiencies, frequently develop in nursing home residents. Hip fractures are often associated with vitamin D deficiency. Trace mineral deficiencies (for example, zinc deficiency) can aggravate immune deficiency and slow wound healing. Inadequate fluid intake leads to dehydration, hypotension, and, in persons with diabetes mellitus, hyperosmolarity. Finally, food intake itself can cause postprandial hypotension (which in turn may precipitate falls), produce electrolyte shifts, and result in aspiration pneumonia. Physical activity programs are an important component of nursing home care that may have an effect on nutritional status, and simple, cost-effective programs may be as beneficial as high-technology programs. Careful attention to the nutritional intake of nursing home residents is both a clinical and a quality-of-life issue."

CD009647,0,18710113,0,Negative fluid balance in patients with abdominal compartment syndrome--case reports.,"Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as a sustained increase of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) above 20 mmHg followed by the development of organ dysfunction. Treatment of ACS is still a question to be discussed and surgical decompression is usually preferred. According to recent data, massive crystalloid resuscitation of shock plays a key role in the development of secondary ACS in trauma patients. As mentioned previously, a high volume of infused crystalloids and a positive fluid balance were associated with ACS development in trauma patients as well as in septic patients. Moreover, we observed that a treatment strategy based on the achievement of a negative fluid balance resulted in a dramatic decrease in IAP and an improvement in haemodynamics and ventilation. This approach has been indicated as an interesting option for non-surgical treatment, with a caution that such intervention may exacerbate gut hypoperfusion. In this report we present two patients with secondary ACS development following abdominal surgery in which the achievement of a negative fluid balance showed a similar effect. Moreover, the fluid removal procedure also seemed to be associated with an improvement in splanchnic perfusion, as measured by gastric tonometry."

CD009647,0,15182283,0,Clinical features of Q fever pneumonia.,"The aim of the study was to assess the clinical features of Q fever pneumonia in Japan. Four cases of Q fever pneumonia (a female aged 21 and males aged 53, 74 and 87 years) who were diagnosed using the PanBio ELISA test kit, were assessed and their clinical features are described. The frequency of Q fever pneumonia among our cases of community-acquired pneumonia was 1.4% (4/284). A 21-year-old female had a typical case of the disease with (i) a history of owning a cat, (ii) onset with fever and dry cough, (iii) multiple soft infiltrative shadows on CXR, (iv) a normal white blood cell count, and (v) good response to clarithromycin. The pneumonias in the other three cases were considered mixed infections with bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Their clinical features included the following: (i) an elderly person with an underlying disease, (ii) onset with fever and purulent sputum, (iii) coarse crackles on auscultation, (iv) infiltrative shadows and pleural effusion on CXR, (v) increased white blood cells with elevated BUN and hyponatraemia, and (vi) modest responses to combined therapy with carbapenem and minocycline. Our observations suggest that two types of pneumonia caused by Coxiella burnetti exist; one with the usual features of atypical pneumonia, and the other presenting with the clinical features of bacterial pneumonia in the elderly due to mixed bacterial infection."

Concerns relating to the safety and tolerability of MRBs in CKD may limit their use in a non clinical trial setting. METHODS In the Chronic Renal Impairment in Birmingham II study, 115 patients with non-diabetic early stage CKD (eGFR 30-89ml/min/1.73m(2) ) received 25mg daily of spironolactone for 4 weeks before randomization to continuing treatment or placebo for a further 36 weeks. All patients were on ACE inhibitors and/or ARB therapy. Potassium and renal function were checked at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 28 and 40.

There were, however, several clinical and laboratory findings that provided clues to the presence of obstructive uropathy. Two of the three patients had low back or abdominal pain. All three patients presented with anemia and significant hyperkalemic, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with only a small increase in anion gap and two of the patients had an inappropriately high urine pH. Neither tubular cell casts nor pigmented granular casts were identified in the urine in any of the patients. In all three patients the urine output increased from oliguric levels to 1400 - 2000 ml/day within 1 day associated with rapidly improving renal function. This report demonstrates and reinforces the need to rule out obstruction in all patients with renal failure of unknown etiology and adds retroperitoneal fibrosis to the list of diseases associated with renal failure and spontaneous recovery."
CD009647,0,7434983,0,[Anesthesia for TUR procedures in the elderly].,"Due to the increased life expectancy since the turn of the century also the urological interventions in patients of older age increased in number and thus in significance. Also when a smaller proportion of the TUR-interventions (in most cases only diagnostic measures) can be carried out in local anaesthesia, for the majority of cases a general anaesthesia or a central conduction anaesthesia is necessary. The particular characteristics of the anaesthesia in endovesical interventions, the pathophysiological peculiarities of the senium, the senile involution of the kidney, and a water and electrolyte balance often disturbed by urological complaints are among others the most important criteria which determine the choice of the anaesthesia in a senile patient when TUR-interventions are to be carried out. Based on an experience of many years, it is reported on the results of anaesthesia in 4,130 geriatric patients, among then 2,818 TUR-interventions. On account of the character of the TUR-interventions, of the age of the patient and the factors of risk even nowadays the central conduction anaesthesia, especially the spinal anaesthesia, is more often the method of choice."

We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of performing repeated measures of echocardiographic and bioimpedance analysis (BIA) parameters and test their response as noninvasive markers of volume response to ivF. We also aimed to identify the most potentially sensitive markers of this response. Patients receiving ivF for a clinical diagnosis of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema were studied. Echocardiographic and BIA parameters were measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h after ivF. Intraobserver variability for each parameter was determined. Thirty-one patients were enrolled who were receiving 40-100 mg of ivF. Transmitral (MV) early peak velocity following Valsalva maneuver and transtricuspid (TV) early peak velocity reduced significantly (P= 0.012 and 0.010, respectively), whereas MV deceleration time increased significantly (P= 0.006) in response to ivF. Short-axis inferior vena cava diameter (SIVC) in expiration and inspiration and SIVC corrected for body surface area in expiration and inspiration reduced significantly following ivF (P= 0.039, 0.020, 0.032, and 0.016, respectively). BIA estimates of extracellular water decreased significantly (P= 0.001), whereas impedance (Z) at currents of 5, 50, 100, and 200 kHz increased following ivF; the changes were significant with all but the last parameter (P < 0.0001, 0.006, 0.010, and 0.051, respectively). Maximal change from baseline for each parameter was greater than its respective intraobserver variability. Performing repeated measures of echocardiographic and BIA parameters is feasible in this unstable group of patients. The above panel of parameters could potentially be used to track volume response to ivF and, thus, to optimize treatment in acute pulmonary edema."

CD009647,0,2242791,0,Frictional properties of human forearm and vulvar skin: influence of age and correlation with transepidermal water loss and capacitance.,"The dynamic friction coefficient between skin and a Teflon probe and its correlation with age, body weight, height, transepidermal water loss and skin capacitance was studied in vulvar and forearm skin of 44 healthy female volunteers. The friction coefficient of vulvar skin was 0.66 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SEM) compared to that of forearm skin of 0.48 +/- 0.01. The difference was highly significant (p less than 0.001). Multiple-regression analysis showed that the vulvar skin friction coefficient was significantly correlated with capacitance as an indicator of stratum corneum hydration (p less than 0.01) but not with age, weight, height or transepidermal water loss. It is concluded that the high friction coefficient of vulvar skin may be due to the increased hydration of vulvar skin. Age-related differences seem to exist for transepidermal water loss and friction coefficient in forearm but not in vulvar skin."

The nil-by-mouth period led to a significant decrease in forehead tissue thickness. Standardized infusion therapy with Ringer's solution at a rate of 8 ml kg-1 h-1 resulted in a gradual increase in tissue thickness, which was significantly different from preoperative baseline values after 90 min. Packed cell volume decreased significantly after the start of infusion and remained low over the rest of the observation time. Different body positions did not influence changes in tissue thickness. We conclude that changes in perioperative tissue thickness in healthy patients can be detected easily by ultrasound, independent of body position. This method may prove useful for the non-invasive assessment of fluid balance state."

Plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels were below normal. She was found to have been taking licorice-containing herbal medicines for the last 7 years. With the discontinuation of the licorice-containing medicines and administration of spironolactone together with intravenous and oral potassium supplement, her serum potassium level was normalized and her clinical symptoms and hypertension improved within 2 weeks."
CD009647,0,3599344,0,Efficacy and reduced metabolic side effects of a 15-mg chlorthalidone formulation in the treatment of mild hypertension. A multicenter study.,"We compared a new low-dose chlorthalidone formulation consisting of 15 mg of this compound and a biocompatible polymer in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial with the standard 25-mg dose of chlorthalidone in the management of mild essential hypertension. Two hundred twenty-two patients, ranging in age from 21 to 69 years, with an average standing diastolic blood pressure between 91 and 104 mm Hg participated in this trial. At the end of 12 weeks, the percentage of patients who had a decrease in their standing diastolic blood pressure of 5 mm Hg or more was statistically similar in both of the active-treatment groups and significantly different from the placebo group. With the lower-dose compound, the metabolic side effect of hypokalemia was less of a problem and there was no evidence of glucose intolerance. Thus, this new 15-mg formulation of chlorthalidone appears to be an effective antihypertensive agent with fewer metabolic side effects compared with the standard 25-mg dose in the management of mild essential hypertension."
CD009647,0,1337961,0,Effects of cyclosporine on tubular acidification function in patients with idiopathic uveitis.,"Renal tubular acidification function was studied in 12 patients treated with cyclosporine (Cy) for idiopathic uveitis (IU) and in 5 patients with IU not treated with Cy. After intravenous bicarbonate loading fractional bicarbonate excretion was similar in both groups indicating normal proximal tubular acidification function. Plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and transtubular potassium gradient were similar in both groups. Distal hydrogen ion secretion evaluated by the ability to increase urine-blood (U-B) pCO2 in a highly alkaline urine was impaired in Cy-treated patients (31.8 +/- 3.2 mm Hg) as compared to controls (47.9 +/- 0.5 mm Hg) (p < 0.005). We conclude that Cy therapy is associated with a distal acidification defect with a low U-B pCO2 gradient during sodium bicarbonate loading. Because none of our Cy-treated patients spontaneously developed over metabolic acidosis one could classify them as having an incomplete form of distal tubular acidosis."
CD009647,0,8030843,0,Screening an elderly population for verifiable adverse drug reactions. Methodological approach and initial data of the Berlin Aging Study (BASE).,"Older adults are known to carry the largest risk for potential adverse drug reactions (ADR) due to the increased number of diseases and concurrent drug therapies. Prevalence rates of the most frequently used drugs in this population have already been evaluated, but the actual rates of specific drug-related risks (e.g., renal dysfunction) have not. Precise estimates of specific ADR risks rely on careful evaluation of the complete drug regimen for potential adverse effects, especially for elderly subjects. In addition, evaluations of manifest ADR have generally been based on reviews of individual medical records of self-reported symptoms. Systematic screening of a representative sample of elders for verifiable potential ADR has not been performed to date and is methodologically challenging. However, the present study attempts to assess both the prevalence of explicitly defined risks for known ADR and the corresponding co-occurrence of laboratory parameter alterations using a new approach. Initial findings are reported for a nearly-representative, age and sex stratified sample of 70 to 100+ year old subjects (n = 336) who participated in the Berlin Aging Study (BASE). Analyses focused on adverse drug effects on fluid and electrolyte balance and renal function. The results indicated an overall prevalence rate of 50% for selected ADR risks and a rate of 26% for the co-occurrence of corresponding laboratory alterations. By taking age into account, preliminary multivariate analyses did not support the hypothesis of increasing ADR susceptibility with advancing age."
CD009647,0,3717155,0,Effect of hyperglycemia on serum sodium concentration and tonicity in outpatients on chronic dialysis.,"When serum glucose concentration is nearly normal, serum sodium concentration and tonicity are usually normal in ambulatory outpatient diabetics on chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. In hyperglycemia, patients on hemodialysis do not undergo osmotic diuresis and are able to nearly normalize their serum tonicity by increasing the intake of water. Patients on peritoneal dialysis differ from hemodialysis patients because of continued loss of water in the peritoneal dialysate and achieve only partial correction of tonicity by water consumption. The model currently used to predict changes in serum sodium concentration and in tonicity from hyperglycemia assumes no changes in external balance of body water or solute during development of hyperglycemia and, therefore, is not applicable in ambulatory dialysis patients with intact thirst mechanism, because of water retention. In ambulatory patients on chronic dialysis, clinical manifestations of hyperglycemia include thirst, water intake, and weight gain. Neurologic manifestations due to hypertonicity are usually absent."
CD009647,0,10826233,1,Evaluating the reliability and utility of cumulative intake and output.,"During times of scarce resources available for providing patient care, it becomes necessary to validate the effectiveness of standard practices that consume caregivers' time and efforts. Three nurse managers of nursing units serving diverse patient populations studied the effectiveness of continuous intake and output in estimating daily fluid balance. They examined 48-hour records of daily weight and intake and output of 73 patients and correlated the two. Their findings suggest that even when caregiver charting compliance is optimal, daily intake and output recording provides unreliable results. The authors recommend daily weights alone be adopted for all patients who are not experiencing acute renal conditions."
CD009647,0,3948466,0,Metoclopramide decreases renal plasma flow.,"Intravenous dopamine has been shown to increase renal plasma flow in man. The role of endogenous dopamine in the maintenance of renal plasma flow has not been described. We speculated that if endogenous dopamine activity is important in the maintenance of renal plasma flow, then high doses of a potent dopamine blocking drug such as metoclopramide would decrease renal flow. To test this hypothesis, we measured renal plasma flow using a single-injection technique with 131I-labeled orthoiodohippurate. Measurements were made before and after the administration of high doses of metoclopramide (1 to 2.5 mg/kg) to 20 patients receiving metoclopramide as an antiemetic before chemotherapy. Seven control subjects underwent sequential measurements of renal plasma flow without intervening metoclopramide dosing. Mean (+/- SD) renal plasma flow did not change in the control population (from 441 +/- 198 to 437 +/- 117 ml/min), but declined significantly in the patients who received metoclopramide (443 +/- 115 ml/min before metoclopramide and 387 +/- 137 ml/min after metoclopramide; P less than 0.001). In 25% of our study population the decline in renal plasma flow was greater than 20% below baseline levels. The magnitude of the effect did not appear to correlate with the pretreatment creatinine clearance, age, or sex of the patients. We conclude that high doses of metoclopramide decrease renal plasma flow in man. These data suggest a role for dopamine in the maintenance of renal plasma flow in patients receiving intravenous hydration. Changes of the magnitude we observed may well be of clinical importance. These findings therefore also suggest the possibility of metoclopramide potentiation of cisplatin nephrotoxicity."
CD009647,0,856258,0,Ultracentrifugal studies of human luteinizing hormone and its subunits: dependence on protein concentration and ionic strength.,"Purified human pituitary luteinizing hormone (hLH) and its alpha and beta subunits have been examined by physical methods. Freshly prepared hLH showed three closely adjacent bands on electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels under alkaline conditions, but on standing even in the freeze-dried condition additional bands appeared. alpha and beta subunits gave bands which were quite different from the main hLH bands but comparable with the additional bands, as well as traces of hLH bands. hLH was investigated at three ionic strengths (0.1, 0.2, 0.5) at pH 5.9 +/- 0.1. Sedimentation velocity experiments demonstrated a complex system of association-dissociation which was further investigated by sedimentation equilibrium. Association occurred at the higher protein concentrations at each ionic strength, but to a significantly higher level at I = 0.5. Only at I = 0.1, pH 5.8, was there a clear indication over a range of protein concentration of the occurrence of a species of molecular weight 32 000 +/- 2000, in fair agreement only with the sum of the molecular weights of the alpha and beta subunits. At higher ionic strengths, there were indications of dissociation at low protein concentration (less than 0.10 g/100 mL) as well as association at higher values (greater than 0.20 g/100 mL). In view of the occurrence of molecular weights less than 28 000 at I = 0.2, HLH was treated in terms of a monomer of molecular weight 14 000, and some evidence was obtained for tetramer formation (4M = M4). At higher ionic strength this model does not apply and it is thought that indefinite association may be occurring to some extent also. The alpha subunit gave indications of association from its sedimentation coefficient vs. concentration plot, and sedimentation equilibrium (at pH 5.9 I = 0.1) demonstrated molecular weights increasing with increasing concentration. Evidence for tetramer formation also was obtained. The beta subunit, in spite of an apparently simple sedimentation coefficient-concentration curve, showed molecular weights varying from well below 14 000 to beyond 20 000. There is evidence to suggest that the isolated alpha and beta subunits, even on standing as dry solid, are not stable but give rise to lower molecular weight products. Aged freeze-dried hLH did not show such impurity."
CD009647,0,3316670,0,Dehydration in the elderly: a short review.,"Dehydration is the most common fluid and electrolyte problem among the elderly. The usual causes of water loss are frequently absent in dehydrated elderly patients. Age-related changes in total body water, thirst perception, renal concentrating ability, and vasopressin effectiveness probably predispose to dehydration. Dehydration related to infection, high-protein tube feedings, cerebral vascular accidents, and medication-related hypodypsia are particularly relevant for elderly patients. Appropriate treatment depends on accurately assessing the water deficit and slowly correcting that deficit."
CD009647,0,19156017,0,L-carnitine and short chain ester in tears from patients with dry eye.,"The tear film is essential for the integrity of the ocular surface. In ocular diseases such as dry eye syndrome (DES), tear film osmolarity is increased relative to normal physiological conditions. DES can be caused by deficiency in lachrymation, hyperevaporation, or surface alterations. Carnitines, shown to have osmoregulatory properties, are thought to regulate tear film osmolarity, thus protecting the corneal surface from damage. We investigated the presence of carnitine in tears, compared tear carnitine concentrations in healthy subjects and in DES patients and speculate on carnitine's potential role as a protective agent in the tear film."

CD009647,0,7053305,0,Amiloride in primary hyperaldosteronism.,"Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic used in spontaneous and diuretic-induced hypokalemia. The effect of amiloride was studied prospectively in 12 patients with primary hyperaldosteronism. Four patients had unilateral adrenal adenomas and eight had bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. All patients were hypertensive and their mean plasma potassium levels were low. Amiloride, 10 to 40 mg daily, was given for 6 mo. Mean plasma potassium levels rose (0.96 mEq/l, P less than 0.001) and remained normal throughout the study without potassium supplementation. Mean blood pressure was lowered by amiloride (22/10 mm Hg, P less than 0.001) but normotension required concomitant antihypertensive therapy in most patients. No significant adverse clinical or laboratory experiences could be directly attributed to amiloride therapy. There was no correlation between the response to therapy and the plasma aldosterone levels, aldosterone secretion rate, or presence of a unilateral adrenal adenoma. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of amiloride in the correction of hypokalemia and amelioration of hypertension in primary hyperaldosteronism."

A high dose group (HDG) received 120-160 mg and a low dose group (LDG) 20-40 mg furosemide daily for six weeks. Mortality and reinfarction rates did not differ between the groups. One HDG patient and five LDG patients developed severe LVF. Four HDG patients developed severe dehydration. Serum enzyme activities and electrolytes were similar in both groups. The increased diuresis in the HDG was accompanied by a 4% hemoconcentration, smaller radiological heart volumes, higher heart rates, a higher demand for nitroglycerin and higher ratings of thirst. Exercise tests yielded similar results in both groups. Later blood volumes and transthoracic electrical impedance were similar in both groups. It is concluded that liberal prophylactic furosemide treatment in AMI offers no major clinical advantage."

CD009647,0,6291819,0,Aldosterone response to antihypertensive treatment.,"To investigate whether changes in aldosterone during antihypertensive treatment would be related to alterations in the renin-angiotensin system or to changes in sodium-fluid balance, 54 essential hypertensives were hospitalized. Sodium intake was restricted to 55 mmoles per day. Levels of renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone were measured before and after two weeks treatment with atenolol (n=15), prazosin (n=15), the converting enzyme inhibitor MK 421 (n=6), verapamil (n=9) and the vasodilator L 6150 (n=10). Daily sodium excretion was determined from 24 h urine collections. The results indicate that, when renin or angiotensin levels do not change, the aldosterone response depends on alterations in sodium balance. When the renin system is depressed, sodium loss may prevent a large drop in aldosterone levels. It is concluded that during antihypertensive treatment body sodium status in itself modifies aldosterone secretion, irrespective of the renin-angiotensin system."
CD009647,0,2645915,0,Antihypertensive effect of insulin reduction in diabetic-hypertensive patients.,"Body weight, urinary volume, sodium and potassium excretion, and blood pressure were evaluated for six days in twelve type II diabetic women, taking insulin doses over their need, after insulin daily dosage reduction. Six of them were suffering from essential hypertension. A significant decrease in body weight with an increase in urinary volume and in urinary sodium excretion was found in all patients. However, no significant variation in plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone output was observed. Urinary potassium excretion remained unchanged. In normotensive subjects no variation of blood pressure levels occurred. On the contrary, hypertensive patients exhibited, after insulin reduction, a fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which correlated directly with body weight decrease and inversely with urinary volume and urinary sodium excretion increases. Hypotheses relating insulin action to hypertension are discussed."

CD009647,0,11968582,0,[Sonographic study of the diameter of the inferior vena cava for optimal ultrafiltration in hemodialysis].,"The objective of the work was to evaluate the results of sonographic examination of the diameter of the vena cava inferior (VCI) as a parameter of hydratation of haemodialyzed patients. In a group of 84 haemodialyzed patients, mean age 66.32 years, the collapsibility index of the IVC was measure. The collapsibility index (CI) was calculated according to the formula: [formula: see text] where IVCexp = the maximum diameter of the IVC in maximum inspiration. Values of the index within the range from 40-75% corresponded to normal hydratation. The results were compared with ultrafiltration (total and expressed as % of body weight after haemodialyzation), ""dry"" body weight and with changes of BP during haemodialysis. The mean value of CI was 63.24 +/- 18.54. In 54 instances it was within the normal range (62.26 +/- 11.4), in 10 it was lower (27.7 +/- 6.02; possible sign of inadequate ultrafiltration during dialysis) and in 20 instances it was higher (84.9 +/- 7.53; risk of excessive ultrafiltration). Clinically assessed ""dry"" weight was adequate in 64% cases. In 24% UF was excessive. With this corresponded also the incidence of hypotension (40%) and in these patients the ""dry"" weight was subsequently elevated. The predictive importance of low values of CI for inadequate UF is however not unequivocal. Some of these patients were hypotensive even in case of low UF and did not tolerate its increase."
CD009647,0,17704435,0,Application of bioelectrical impedance to clinical assessment of body composition in peritoneal dialysis.,"Patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) develop complex changes in body composition. These changes reflect hydration, nutrition, and body fat, all important elements reflecting patient well-being and efficacy of therapy that should be assessed and monitored as guides to patient management. They are all notoriously difficult to accurately measure in clinical practice and simultaneous abnormalities may obscure detection, as in the malnourished fluid-overloaded patient where body weight is misleadingly stable. Malnutrition is a serious complication in PD that carries an adverse prognosis. Assessment of hydration in PD is important in determining ""dry weight"" to allow adjustment of dialysis prescription to optimize fluid balance. A number of techniques have been investigated to measure body composition in clinical practice. Of these, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has attracted most interest and seems to be of greatest promise. Cases illustrating different aspects of the use of BIA in PD patients are described, and the background, possible uses, and limitations of BIA in PD patients are discussed. To be of clinical value, BIA must be used to distinguish between extracellular water (which reflects hydration) and body cell mass, or intracellular water (which declines in wasting and malnutrition). The high precision of BIA is ideally suited to detecting changes in body composition and its main role may be in longitudinal monitoring. However, inaccuracy of absolute measurements and variability of normal values in the general population make precise diagnosis of the degree of normality of body composition in an individual subject a more difficult task for body composition analysis."
CD009647,0,7979169,0,Accuracy of bioelectrical impedance analysis in estimation of extracellular space in healthy subjects and in fluid retention states.,"Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a noninvasive method recently introduced for body fluid evaluation in healthy subjects. The purpose of this paper is to verify the reliability of bioelectrical measurements in extracellular water (ECW) prediction in healthy subjects and in fluid retention states. We studied 40 subjects (19 males and 21 females) aged 21-81 years; 22 were healthy subjects, 12 were affected by chronic heart failure, and 6 by chronic renal failure. In all subjects resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) at 1 and 50 kHz corrected for height were compared with ECW measured by the bromide dilution method. Our results suggested a different behavior of the current in fluid-retention states with respect to healthy subjects. ECW was best predicted by resistance at 1 kHz corrected for height, group (considered as dummy variable), weight and gender (R2 = 0.89, p < 0.001, SEE = 1.7 liters). The bioelectrical impedance analysis at 50 kHz explained the 89% of ECW variability when resistance and reactance corrected for height are considered with gender group and weight (R2 = 0.89, p < 0.001, SEE = 1.7 liters). In conclusion, the bioelectrical method at 1 kHz can be considered sufficiently accurate in ECW prediction in healthy subjects and in fluid retention states. Also, the bioelectrical impedance analysis at 50 kHz is useful for predicting ECW, but his role must be further investigated."

Autologous platelet collection was also made the day before the operation. These autologous blood donations were safely and successfully performed along with hemodialysis. There was some caution taken for these procedures. The ultrafiltration rate had to be adjusted for blood collection or blood transfusion during hemodialysis in order not to disturb fluid balance. It was necessary to monitor the hyperkalemia of the stored autologous packed red blood cells. For platelet collection, blood in the extracorporeal circuit had to be concentrated because of the presence of renal anemia.

In a double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study, K+ 0.3 or 0.4 mmol.kg-1 body weight was infused IV on two occasions while the patients also received an infusion either of placebo or 0.5 mg of the ACE inhibitor perindoprilat in random order. Plasma K+ levels and urinary K+ excretion were measured at regular intervals. During the study patients adhered to an isocaloric diet providing a standardised daily intake of potassium and sodium (50 mmol K+ and 40 mmol Na+). The median rise in plasma K+ was not significantly different after placebo (delta K 0.66 mmol.l-1) compared with to the infusion of perindoprilat (delta K 0.66 mmol.l-1). The median baseline urinary K+ excretion rate was 6.5 mmol.3 h-1 before the placebo infusion and 5.9 mmol.3 h-1 before infusion of perindoprilat. During the potassium load, the urinary excretion rate rose to 16.1 mmol.3 h-1 (after placebo) and 15.1 mmol.3 h-1 after perindoprilat in the first 3 h, and it returned almost to the baseline value within the next 3 h (5.6 mmol.3 h-1 after placebo and 5.7 mmol.3 h-1 after perindoprilat); the differences were not statistically significant. With perindoprilat a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure and ACE activity, an increase in renin plasma activity and a decrease in aldosterone concentrations were observed compared to the placebo infusion. There was no significant differences plasma in adrenaline or insulin levels after either infusion. Thus, ACE inhibition did not interfere either with the extrarenal or the renal disposal of an acute potassium load in patients with chronic renal failure."

CD009647,0,10769847,0,[A case of a pituitary mass in association with sarcoidosis].,"We report a case of a pituitary mass associated with sarcoidosis. Natural regression of the mass was demonstrated after the replacement of corticosteroid hormone. A seventy-one-year old man presented with blurred vision and general fatigability, and admitted to our hospital. He was diagnosed to have ophthalmic and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Two months later, he consulted our hospital again, with complaints of fatigability and vomiting. Laboratory data showed hyponatremia, and CT scan revealed a suprasellar mass. He had no neurological deficits. Diabetes insipidus was not observed. Magnetic resonance image showed a heterogeneously enhanced intrasellar and suprasellar dumbbell shaped mass and thickening of the pituitary stalk. Hormonal examination revealed corticosteroid insufficiency and hypothyroidism, possibly caused by the pituitary mass. Replacement of corticosteroid hormone significantly improved his fatigability. Two months later, follow-up MRI showed regression of the pituitary mass. Based on the clinical and radiological findings, pituitary mass was strongly suggested to be caused by sarcoidosis. We recommend prompt steroid treatment for such a pituitary mass and strict follow-up MRI study."

CD009647,0,11792756,0,Urine macrophage migration inhibitory factor reflects the severity of renal injury in human glomerulonephritis.,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a pathogenic role in experimental crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN). Renal expression of MIF is also upregulated in human GN and correlates with leukocytic infiltration, histologic damage, and renal dysfunction. The study presented here examined whether MIF can be measured in urine and if so, whether the urine MIF concentration reflects the degree of renal injury. Urine and serum MIF was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 10 normal healthy volunteers and in a cohort of 63 patients with GN (2 thin basement membrane disease [TBM], 15 membranous GN, 10 focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, 20 IgA glomerularnephritis, 11 crescentic GN, 10 systemic lupus erythematosis World Health Organization class IV). Renal MIF expression was assessed by immunostaining of biopsy tissue. MIF was detected in urine from normal volunteers (mean +/- SD; 191 +/- 132 pg MIF/micromol creatinine). The urine MIF concentration was unchanged in patients with nonproliferative nephropathies (343 +/- 397 pg MIF/micromol Cr) but was increased 3.4-fold in proliferative nephropathies (645 +/- 527 pg MIF/micromol Cr; P < 0.05 versus normal and nonproliferative). Stratified analysis showed the greatest increase in urine MIF in crescentic GN (4.5-fold). In contrast, serum MIF levels were not different between normal patients and any patient group. Immunostaining demonstrated a significant increase in renal MIF expression in proliferative glomerulonephritides that was associated with macrophage and T cell infiltration. There was a significant correlation between the urine MIF concentration and renal MIF expression, but not with serum MIF, indicating a renal origin for the excreted urine MIF. The urine MIF concentration also correlated with the degree of renal dysfunction, histologic damage, and leukocytic infiltration, but not with the amount of proteinuria. In conclusion, this study shows that the urine MIF concentration is significantly increased in proliferative forms of GN and correlates with the degree of renal injury. Urine MIF levels reflect MIF expression within the kidney and may be a useful noninvasive tool for monitoring patients with crescentic GN, particularly in disease exacerbation."
CD009647,0,11230776,0,Body composition and energy balance: lack of effect of short-term hormone replacement in postmenopausal women.,"Postmenopausal women (PMW) commonly believe that hormone replacement (HR) leads to weight gain, and fear of weight gain and/or an actual increase in weight is one of the principle reasons evoked for the discontinuation of HR. However, the potential effects of physiologic HR on body composition have yet to be separated from the effects of lifestyle or aging. Therefore, we examined the effect of short-term hormone replacement and age on alterations in weight, body composition, and energy balance. A prospective study of 28 healthy PMW aged 45 to 55 years (younger PMW, studies completed n = 18) and 70 to 80 years (older PMW, studies completed n = 15) was conducted. The last menstrual period was more than 12 months previously. The women had a body mass index (BMI) less than 30 kg/m(2) and were taking no medication. Subjects were studied at baseline, after 1 month of transdermal estrogen (Estraderm, 50 microg/day) administration (E2), followed by a further month of transdermal estrogen with progesterone (100 mg per vagina twice daily) for the final 7 days (E2 + P). Anthropometric measurements and energy assessments were performed at each visit. Physiologic HR was achieved in each subject, and there was no difference between levels achieved in older and younger women. Resting energy expenditure and activity level were positively correlated with fat-free mass (P <.0001), while energy intake was not. Resting energy expenditure was lower in older compared with younger PMW when adjusted for fat-free mass (P <.005). Energy intake was also lower in the older PMW when corrected for fat-free mass (P <.0001); as was activity level (P <.05). There was no effect of hormonal treatment on any of the parameters measured. Changes in weight from baseline for E2 (0.37 +/- 0.25 and 0.61 +/- 0.27 kg in younger and older) and E2 + P (0.11 +/- 0.38 and 0.28 +/- 0.31 kg) were not statistically significant. In addition, there was no difference in BMI, fat mass, fat-free mass, total body water, or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) between groups or with hormonal treatment. In conclusion, short-term transdermal HR is not associated with significant changes in weight or other anthropometric measures in younger or older PMW. These studies confirm the decrease in energy expenditure that occurs with aging, but indicates that there is no effect of HR on resting energy expenditure."
CD009647,0,1822265,0,Sleep patterns and blood pressure variability in patients with pure autonomic failure.,"Sleep patterns and 24-h blood pressure variability were studied in four female patients (age range: 56-82 years) with pure autonomic failure. All patients had severe symptomatic postural hypotension, without neurological deficits. In these patients the following patterns were observed: (i) a reversed diurnal blood pressure pattern, with the highest values observed at sleep onset; (ii) a prolonged sleep latency and increased amount of stage 3 sleep; (iii) difficulty with getting up after awakening in the morning, due to severe postural hypotension; (iv) an absence of prominent respiratory abnormalities during sleep; and (v) a dissociation between respiratory and haemodynamic findings. It is concluded that isolated deficiency of presumed postganglionic autonomic function influences sleep architecture, probably through absence of buffering of diurnal haemodynamic alterations, such as by postural hypotension and its consequences for body fluid volume regulation. This may be of relevance when sleep patterns are studied in other types of autonomic failure with postural hypotension involving central or preganglionic lesions, as in patients with the Shy-Drager syndrome or multiple system atrophy."

CD009647,0,11195401,0,[Three cases of severe hyponatremia under taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)].,"The association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs) and hyponatremia has been documented throughout the world. In Japan, since SSRIs have recently come into use for patients with depression, there are only a few reports of hyponatremia associated with SSRIs. We present here three cases of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone(SIADH) associated with the administration of fluvoxamine for depression. They were admitted to our hospital because of deep coma, and revealed severe hyponatremia. Their serum sodium levels were 103-112 mEq/l, serum osmolalities were 227-241 mmol/kg, urine sodium levels were 38-107 mEq/l, and urine osmolalities were 352-781 mmol/kg. These patients were started on fluvoxamine 3 days-3 months previously. The diagnosis of SIADH in these patients was made based on hyponatremia, and low serum and high urine osmolalities. The fluvoxamine treatment was discontinued, and hypertonic saline was infused. Their serum sodium levels and osmolalities were subsequently normalized. None of the other known causes of hyponatremia, including diuretic therapy, tumors, and respiratory and central nervous system diseases, were present. High plasma AVP levels observed in the two cases suggest that SSRIs stimulate AVP secretion, thereby causing SIADH. Many reports have shown that people older than 70 years were at a particularly high risk of developing hyponatremia when SSRIs were used. In the future, since the use of SSRIs will be increasing, the water and electrolyte balance of elderly patients should be monitored carefully during SSRIs therapy."
CD009647,0,798060,0,Shock in the emergency department.,"Shock continues to be associated with a high mortality rate primarily because of delays in diagnosis and therapy. To diagnose shock early, and thereby increase the chances of reversal before there is extensive deterioration of vital organs, one should look for any decrease in pulse pressure, urine output, urine sodium concentration, alertness or any increase in urine osmolarity, tachypnea or tachycardia. Systolic hypotension, oliguria, metabolic acidosis and a cold clammy skin are late signs of shock. The pathophysiology of early hypovolemic shock includes hyperventilation, vasoconstriction, cardiac stimulation, fluid shifts into the vascular system and platelet aggregation. Late shock is characterized by lysosomal breakdown, subsequent release of kinins (especially bradykinin), impaired cell metabolism and organ function, fluid shifts out of the vascular system because of capillary endothelial damage and intravascular coagulation. The primary cause of shock should not be neglected in favor of treating signs, symptoms, and laboratory data. The resuscitation from the shock process itself involves correction of pathophysiologic changes, based on objective trends and responses rather than isolated measurements. A suggested outline of therapies in order of their use includes: 1) correction of the primary problem; 2) ventilation and oxygen; 3) fluid-loading: 4) inotropic agents; 5) correction of acid-based and electrolyte abnormalities; 6) steroids (""physiologic"" or ""pharmacologic"" doses); 7) vasopressors (especially in elderly, severely hypotensive patients); 8) vasodilators (if excess vasoconstriction); 9) diuretics (if oliguric in spite of the above), and 10) heparin (if DIC). The most common errors are 1) late diagnosis; 2) inadequate control of the primary problems; 3) inadequate fluid loading; 4) delayed ventilator assistance, and 5) excessive reliance on and use if vasopressors and diuretics."
CD009647,0,8968982,0,Application of total body bioimpedance to the critically ill patient. Brazilian Group for Bioimpedance Study.,"In the past several years, considerable interest has developed in the study of total body bioimpedance analysis (TBBIA) and body composition in healthy subjects. This simple and noninvasive technique uses derived and regression equations to validate data comparative to the gold standards of total body water determination and body composition. However, this approach has not proved to be of value in the critically ill patient with distorted body composition under the effects of multiple drugs and interventions. Notwithstanding, in recent years several authors have demonstrated the usefulness of this technique, apart from derived equations, relying solely in the judicious interpretation of the primary impedance parameters: resistance (R, ohms [omega], reactance (Xc, omega) and the derived phase angle (phi, degrees). The principles of bioelectrical impedance postulate that R is the opposition of total body water and electrolytes to the flow of an alternating current of low amplitude and high frequency, typically 800 microA and 50 kHz, and Xc is the capacitance produced by tissue interface and cell membranes. The phase shift is quantified geometrically as the angular transformation of the ratio Xc/R and is designated as phi. Altered cellular membrane function is a common feature of the septic patient and it has been systematically associated with a significant low Xc and phi. On the other hand, the fluid balance can be precisely monitored by the changes in R, and the serial measurements of the relation Xc/R (or the phi) has been utilized to discriminate between normal subjects and patients, and between septic and nonseptic critically ill patient. Some authors have demonstrated that this relation Xc/R is highly correlated with mortality and could be used for the staging of critically ill patients throughout their stay in the ICU. The role of TBBIA as a simple and noninvasive technique, and its implications for the management of critically ill patients are presented and discussed. Areas for future investigations, with single and multiple frequency, have the potential to clarify many aspects of this emergent technology at the bedside."

The hypokalemia resulted from diuretic treatment. He had no family history of myopathy, and no diarrhea and vomiting. The neurological examination revealed painful quadriplegia. The blood pressure was 160/74 mm Hg. Laboratory examination showed hypokalemic and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (serum K 1.5 mEq/l, serum Cl 89 mEq/l, base excess + 20.9, HCO3- 44.9 mmol/l, pH 7.563) and marked elevations of serum CPK, LDH, GOT, GPT and myoglobin. Endocrinological and renal functions were normal. Muscle biopsy revealed marked necrosis with remarkable phagocytosis and vacuolar degeneration. The cessation of diuretics and intravenous infusion of potassium chloride resulted in a marked improvement in clinical and laboratory findings. The diuretics-induced hypokalemic myopathy is rare in the literature."
CD009647,0,15135699,0,"Relation of unrecognized hypervolemia in chronic heart failure to clinical status, hemodynamics, and patient outcomes.","Clinically unrecognized intravascular volume overload may contribute to worsening symptoms and disease progression in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The present study was undertaken to prospectively compare measured blood volume status (determined by radiolabeled albumin technique) with clinical and hemodynamic characteristics and patient outcomes in 43 nonedematous ambulatory patients with CHF. Blood volume analysis demonstrated that 2 subjects (5%) were hypovolemic (mean deviation from normal values -20 +/- 6%), 13 subjects (30%) were normovolemic (mean deviation from normal values -1 +/- 1%), and 28 subjects (65%) were hypervolemic (mean deviation from normal values +30 +/- 3%). Physical findings of congestion were infrequent and not associated with blood volume status. Increased blood volume was associated with increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p = 0.01) and greatly increased risk of death or urgent cardiac transplantation during a median follow-up of 719 days (1-year event rate 39% vs 0%, p <0.01 by log-rank test). Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in hypervolemic patients than in those with normovolemia or hypovolemia (107 +/- 2 vs 119 +/- 2 mm Hg, p = 0.008), and hypotension was independently associated with increased risk of hypervolemia in multivariate analysis (odds ratio 2.64 for a 10-mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 6.19, p = 0.025). These findings demonstrate that clinically unrecognized hypervolemia is frequently present in nonedematous patients with CHF and is associated with increased cardiac filling pressures and worse patient outcomes."
CD009647,0,7207197,0,"Compartmental body composition of cancer patients by measurement of total body nitrogen, potassium, and water.","Quantitative measurement was made of body composition in patients with several forms of neoplastic disease. Total body nitrogen was determined by means of the prompt gamma neutron activation technique; total body potassium was measured with the use of a whole body counter. The mass and protein content of the muscle compartment and nonmuscle lean tissue were estimated by application of the technique of compartmental analysis. Total body water, determined simultaneously with the use of tritium label, provided a measure of lean body mass. From these data, the body fat can be inferred. The prompt gamma neutron activation and whole body counting techniques represent a considerable advance over the balance and radioisotope techniques used in earlier studies. The new techniques make possible sequential studies over prolonged periods of time with a considerable degree of accuracy. The loss of body weight by patients with solid tumors consisted primarily of the loss of muscle mass and body fat. Even in severe wasting, the patients appear to retain significant amounts of body fat. It is the skeletal muscle which is predominantly lost; the visceral life-supporting system is, to a considerable extent, spared. The nonmuscle tissue including the visceral fraction did not change in this study, and actually appeared to increase in size when comparison was made with the normal contrast population. The loss of total body water was slight in the cancer patients studied."

CD009647,0,18496276,0,Can extracellular fluid volume expansion in hemodialysis patients be safely reduced using the hemocontrol biofeedback algorithm? A randomized trial.,"Extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) expansion in hemodialysis patients is associated with increased mortality. Attempts to remove excess fluid often result in intradialytic hypotension (IDH). Blood volume monitoring has been used to aid selection of ultrafiltration rates and dialysate conductivity to minimize IDH. Automating ultrafiltration and dialysate conductivity using the Hemocontrol Biofeedback System (HBS) has reduced IDH in IDH-prone subjects. We undertook a randomized controlled trial to determine if the HBS could safely reduce ECFV in ECF-expanded subjects. Patients with ECFV >45% of total body water were randomized to receive hemodialysis by either HBS or best clinical practices for 6 months. The primary endpoint was change in ECFV; exploratory variables included frequency of IDH, interdialytic weight gain, and changes in serum Na. Treatment with HBS did not result in any change in ECFV, even after multivariable adjustment. The frequency of IDH was however significantly lower with HBS when compared with best clinical practices without differences in other variables."

As hemodilution lowers systemic vascular resistance, we assessed whether peripheral vasodilation could be limited by a drastic reduction of the volume of infused cardioplegia. Fifty patients underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting procedures using normothermic (35 degrees to 37 degrees C) bypass and normothermic continuous retrograde blood cardioplegia. They were divided into two equal groups: in group 1, blood was diluted 4:1 with hyperkalemic crystalloid cardioplegia, whereas in group 2, the cardioplegic ""solution"" was limited to the sole arresting agents that were concentrated in a small volume (16 mEq potassium chloride and 3 mEq magnesium chloride in a 20-mL ampoule). This ""mini-cardioplegia"" was continuously added to arterial blood so as to keep the heart arrested. The average volume of cardioplegia per patient was 1,000 mL in group 1 and 58 mL in group 2 (p < 0.0001). The mini-cardioplegia technique resulted in a reduced incidence of perioperative systemic vasodilation: group 2 patients required significantly less vasopressors (p < 0.05) and less volume loading, as reflected by significantly lower right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (p < 0.05 and p < 0.03 at 12 hours postoperatively, respectively), compared with group 1 patients who received traditional high-volume cardioplegia. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to myocardial recovery, as assessed by standard clinical and hemodynamic end points.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009647,0,10352200,0,Effect of dialysate temperature on energy balance during hemodialysis: quantification of extracorporeal energy transfer.,"An impaired vascular response is implicated in the pathogenesis of dialysis-induced hypotension, which is at least partly related to changes in extracorporeal blood temperature (Temp). However, little is known about changes in core Temp and differences in energy balance between standard and cool dialysis. In this study, core Temp and energy transfer between extracorporeal circuit and patient, as well as the blood pressure response, were assessed during dialysis with standard (37.5 degrees C) and cool (35.5 degrees C) Temp of the dialysate. Nine patients (4 men, 5 women; mean age, 69 +/-10 [SD] years) were studied during low- and standard-Temp dialysis, each serving as his or her own control. Bicarbonate dialysis and hemophane membranes were used. Energy transfer was assessed by continuous measurement of Temp in the arterial (Tart) and venous side (Tven) of the extracorporeal system according to the formula: c. rho.Qb*(Tven - Tart)*t, where c = specific thermal capacity (3.64 kJ/kg* degrees C), Qb = extracorporeal blood flow, rho = density of blood (1,052 kg/m3), and t = dialysis time (hours). Core Temp was also measured by Blood Temperature Monitoring (BTM; Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany). Core Temp increased during standard-Temp dialysis (36.7 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C to 37.2 degrees C +/- 0.2 degrees C; P < 0.05) despite a small negative energy balance (-85 +/- 43 kJ) from the patient to the extracorporeal circuit. During cool dialysis, energy loss was much more pronounced (-286 +/- 73 kJ; P < 0.05). However, mean core Temp remained stable (36.4 degrees C +/- 0.6 degrees C to 36.4 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C; P = not significant), and even increased in some patients with a low predialytic core Temp. Both during standard and cool dialysis, the increase in core Temp during dialysis was significantly related to predialytic core Temp (r = 0.88 and r = 0.77; P < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure (RR) decreased to a greater degree during standard-Temp dialysis compared with cool dialysis (43 +/- 21 v 22 +/- 26 mm Hg; P < 0.05), whereas diastolic RR tended to decrease more (15 +/- 10 v 0 +/- 19 mm Hg; P = 0.07). Core Temp increased in all patients during standard-Temp dialysis despite a small net energy transfer from the patient to the extracorporeal system. Concluding, Core Temp remained generally stable during cool dialysis despite significant energy loss from the patient to the extracorporeal circuit, and even increased in some patients with a low predialytic core Temp. The change in core Temp during standard and cool dialysis was significantly related to the predialytic blood Temp of the patient, both during cool- and standard-Temp dialysis. The results suggest that the hemodialysis procedure itself affects core Temp regulation, which may have important consequences for the vascular response during hypovolemia. The removal of heat by the extracorporeal circuit and/or the activation of autoregulatory mechanisms attempting to preserve core Temp might be responsible for the beneficial hemodynamic effects of cool dialysis."

A prospective study in 52 patients revealed surprisingly high rates of intravascular fluid loads without clinical manifestations. Only 4 patients developed clinical signs of the TUR syndrome. Immunological work-up in 41 patients demonstrated circulating endotoxins and significant rise of endogenous tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in 3 of these patients. In 11 patients transient endotoxins could be detected during resection under prophylactic parenteral antibiosis. In the face of less invasive approaches to benign prostatic hyperplasia, close intraoperative monitoring and antibiotic coverage should be demanded as a routine procedure during TURP.

CD009647,0,2224755,0,Insulin treatment in the elderly diabetic patient.,"Type II diabetes mellitus may affect as many as 20% of the elderly US population. In the absence of data to support the need to maintain a specific level of glucose beyond that necessary to relieve symptoms, choice of therapy is problematic. Clearly, supervised dietary therapy for the obese type II diabetic patient represents a safe and cost-effective treatment. For those patients who fail dietary therapy because they fail to lose weight or regain lost weight, or because blood glucose levels remain high despite weight loss, further therapy must be individualized. The only rational criteria for drug treatment supportable by currently available data are (1) persistent symptoms associated with hyperglycemia, (2) ketonuria in the unstressed state, and (3) certain cases of hyperlipidemia, especially with triglyceride levels greater than 1000 mg/dl. In these clinical settings, drug therapy is necessary to eliminate symptoms, prevent development of ketoacidosis, and reduce the risk of pancreatitis, respectively. Consideration of drug therapy should also be made in the case of very elevated blood glucose levels, even in the absence of symptoms, when dehydration and risk of severe hyperosmolarity exist. The issues regarding insulin versus sulfonylureas have not been examined specifically in the elderly population. Extrapolating from published studies that generally include patients older than 65 years leads to the following conclusions: Caution regarding adverse side effects of insulin (hypoglycemia, theoretic risk of hyperinsulinemia) and sulfonylureas (hypoglycemia, drug interactions, increased risk of cardiovascular death) must be balanced against the theoretic benefit of treatment in the absence of symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

All patients were admitted within 7 days of onset and the data within 2 weeks of admission were recorded. The incidences of hypernatremia (serum Na greater than or equal to 149 mEq/l), hyponatremia (less than or equal to 134 mEq/l), hyperkalemia (serum K greater than or equal to 4.8 mEq/l) and hypokalemia (less than or equal to 3.2 mEq/l) were higher in patients with hemorrhage (18, 7, 13 and 14%, respectively) than infarction (4.5, 4.5, 11 and 6%, respectively). The incidences of hypernatremia and hyponatremia in infarction were higher in those who had cortical lesions than in those who had lesions in the basal ganglia or infratentorium. In cerebral hemorrhage, the incidence of hypernatremia was the highest in those with brain stem lesion. Hypernatremia was found in 27% of large sized hematoma, being significantly higher than that of those with medium (16%) or small (1%) hematoma. A similar tendency was also observed in hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. In elderly patients, electrolyte disturbances were more common than in young or middle-aged patients.

BP has found to be inversely related to the concentration and activity of plasma RAS components. It has been shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) affects BP more greatly than do other plasma RAS components. It is suggests that RAS activation or depression is an adjustment to BP elevation or lowering. Altered BP triggers the biochemical mechanisms responsible for regulating vascular tone, cardiac output, and water-salt balance. All RAS components under study show a weak association with BP in some patients. It is concluded that the laboratory plasma RAS test is of low informative value in diagnosing hypertension and hypotension in clinical practice."

Major assessments were conducted at baseline and at the end of each 10-week treatment period: primary efficacy variables were total exercise duration (modified Bruce, treadmill), NYHA grade, and clinical signs and symptoms (by visual analogue score) of heart failure. Twenty-seven patients completed the study. There were two deaths (one on each study drug) and six patient withdrawals (one on ramipril and five on digoxin). Although the NYHA grade was significantly better on ramipril than on digoxin, there were no other important differences in the relief of either signs or symptoms of heart failure. A significant order effect was observed with the exercise testing data and therefore only data in the first active treatment period were analyzed; no significant differences were noted. There were fewer reports of adverse effects, and no clinically significant episodes of hyperkalemia or renal impairment on ramipril. We conclude that ramipril seems to be better tolerated and marginally more effective than digoxin in the management of patients with moderate to severe chronic CHF, stabilized on maintenance diuretic therapy."

The effect of these drugs was analyzed in 100 outpatients (52 males and 48 females) aged 52.0 +/- 7.9 years with mild to moderate hypertension, in a prospective 6-month study. After an appropriate workup, the patients were randomized to either 25 mg chlorthalidone (40 patients), 120 mg propranolol (30 patients), or 2 mg per day bopindolol (30 patients). A significant reduction of approximately 10% in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was recorded in all the groups. At the end of the 6th month, in the chlorthalidone group triglycerides increased to 3.0 +/- 2.1 mmol/l from 2.8 +/- 1.6 mmol/l, while cholesterol after an initial increase to 6.6 +/- 1.6 from 6.4 +/- 1.6 mmol/l returned to the baseline level. Uricemia and serum potassium concentration decreased by 4%. The body weight was reduced to 83.8 +/- 13.4 kg from 86.1 +/- 13.4 kg. There was no change in serum glucose level. In the propranolol group, as expected, heart rate decreased by 20%, but there were no significant changes in glucose and potassium plasma concentration. Triglycerides did not change significantly, while cholesterol, after a small increase, returned to the initial levels. Similar results were obtained in the bopindolol group, apart from the triglycerides, which increased significantly (to 2.5 +/- 1.1 from 2.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l), probably because of the lower baseline concentration. We conclude that in prolonged treatment, chlorthalidone, propranolol and bopindolol do not induce significant untoward biochemical changes that alone might increase cardiovascular risk."

CD009647,0,22277176,0,Detection of preclinical body fluid retention in established heart failure patients during follow-up by a digital weight scale incorporating a bioelectrical impedance analyzer.,"This study examined the characteristics of asymptomatic worsening heart failure (HF) events and validated the role of a novel HF monitoring method (measuring body weight [BW] and percent body fat [BF%]) to identify such worsening HF events. A clinician determined worsening HF status by evaluating symptoms, physical signs, and pleural effusion on ultrasonography. A criterion of significant fluid weight gain was defined as BW gain ≥1.5 kg with a concomitant decrease in BF%. A total of 74 HF patients were included. During a mean follow-up of 20.8 months, 1588 visits were evaluated. A total of 79 worsening HF events occurred in 50 patients, in which worsening was symptomatic in 46 events (58%) and asymptomatic in 33 events (42%). Novel method eliminated 42 of 73 (58%) false-positive indications of worsening HF events based only on the BW criterion (≥1.5 kg) without excluding true worsening HF events. The test characteristics of this method in the diagnosis of overall HF events were sensitivity 65.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.3-76.1), specificity 97.9% (95%, CI 97.1-98.6), positive predictive value 62.7% (95% CI, 51.3-73.0), and negative predictive value 98.2% (95% CI, 97.4-98.8). Preclinical fluid retention occurs frequently in established HF patients, and novel monitoring method can specifically identify preclinical worsening HF."

Daily weighing of patients, measurement of fluid intake and output, and knowledge of the probable electrolyte content of fluid losses are adequate guides for replacement of fluids and electrolytes. An increase in body weight is a warning of overhydration.The content of the solution used for replacement is dictated by the route of fluid output-whether from the gastrointestinal tract, the skin, or the kidneys. Insensible losses (by perspiration and respiration) are fairly static. Except to replace extrarenal losses, parenteral administration of normal saline solution in the immediate postoperative period is contraindicated. Mistakes in replacement methods, especially those causing overhydration, are particularly hazardous for elderly patients."
CD009647,0,2273540,0,[The changes in total body water in patients with prolonged anesthesia and surgery].,"We studied the influence of prolonged anesthesia and surgery on total body water (TBW) with tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Eight patients who underwent prolonged anesthesia were selected as the subjects of the study and were compared with nine patients who underwent surgery of less than 3 hours. Plasma hormone concentrations were also examined. In the prolonged anesthesia patients, TBW increased significantly as compared with those of the patients who underwent short surgery (P less than 0.05). TBW showed the most remarkable increase on the first post operative day. Plasma ADH and aldosterone concentrations increased in the patients of both groups. However, we could not find a significant relationship between TBW and plasma hormone concentrations. BIA seems to be a useful method to estimate TBW during perioperative periods. However, further detailed investigation would be necessary to obtain a reliable technique in such an unstable condition."

CD009647,0,11323337,0,Can initial distribution volume of glucose predict hypovolemic hypotension after radical surgery for esophageal cancer?,"We recently reported that the initial distribution volume of glucose (IDVG) reliably measures the central extracellular fluid volume in the presence or absence of fluid gain or loss. We examined which variables, including IDVG, can predict subsequent hypovolemic hypotension produced by the continuous shift of the extracellular fluid from the central to the peripheral compartment early after radical surgery for esophageal cancer. IDVG and plasma volume were calculated after measuring cardiac index (CI), central venous pressure, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure immediately after admission to the intensive care unit. Intraoperative fluid balance and urine volume were also recorded. Postoperative hypovolemic hypotension was clinically defined as systolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg responsive to IV fluid administration. Either IDVG < 105 mL/kg or CI < 3.4 L. min(-1). m(-2) was associated with subsequent hypovolemic hypotension (P = 0.002 for the former and P = 0.00 03 for the latter), while remaining variables were not. IDVG and CI were well correlated (r = 0.8 7, n = 25, P = 0.0001). Our results suggest that IDVG can help predict the subsequent hypovolemic hypotension early after radical surgery for esophageal cancer."
CD009647,0,7261837,0,Intracellular and exchangeable potassium in cirrhosis. Evidence against the occurrence of potassium depletion in cirrhosis with ascites.,"The intracellular potassium content of leukocytes, the extracellular fluid volume (82Br space), and exchangeable potassium were determined in 28 patients with cirrhosis of the liver (18 with ascites) and in 15 hospitalized controls. No intracellular potassium depletion could be identified in these patients. Leukocyte potassium was similar in cirrhotic patients with and without ascites (355.9 +/- 25.3 and 348.1 +/- 31.9 mEq/kg of dry solids, respectively) and in hospitalized controls (359.7 +/- 27.4) (mean +/- SD). The extracellular fluid volume was similar in controls and cirrhotics without ascites, but markedly increased in cirrhotics with ascites. The exchangeable potassium (mEq/kg of body weight) was similar in nonascitic cirrhotics and in hospitalized controls, but significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. However, when the estimated weight of the extracellular fluid volume was substrated from the total body weight, thus obviating the influence of the increased extracellular fluid volume of ascitic patients in the body weight, the exchangeable potassium (mEq/kg of ""corrected"" body weight) was similar in cirrhosis with ascites (52.9 +/- 6.7 mEq/kg), nonascitic cirrhotics (55.8 +/- 6.1 mEq/kg) and hospitalized controls (55.0 +/- 8.3 mEq/kg), and a significant correlation was obtained between the exchangeable potassium and the leukocyte potassium content. In five patients, the measurements were repeated after relieving ascites with diuretics. No change was observed in the leukocyte potassium, but exchangeable potassium (mEq/kg of body weight) increased, reaching values not significantly different from controls or nonascitic cirrhotics. The exchangeable potassium (mEq/kg of ""correct"" body weight) did not change. Our results strongly suggest that potassium depletion was not present in the series of cirrhotic patients studied."

We examined the treated areas by measuring transepidermal water loss, capacitance and electrical impedance. Our findings suggest that both moisturisers seem equally effective, at least concerning the ability to reverse impedance indices towards normal, an effect ascribed to changes in hydration of the stratum corneum.

Patients with hyperkinetic type of hemocirculation had a sodium lack at the stage of stable hypertension, therefore the diuretic treatment is not indicated for such patients. The treatment with the diuretic oxodolin was accompanied by the decrease in the peripheral resistance of blood vessels, in sodium metabolism and its extracellular fraction, and by the increase of the deposit sodium fraction.

In a prospective randomized study, 21 live (Group 1) and 11 dead patients (Group 2) were included. The investigation was based upon the application of the invasive tracing of oxygen hemodynamics and transport. The findings of the initially hypovolemic status were compared with those of the stabile normovolemic status obtained by the application of infusions and the blood volume substitute. In the early phase of the disease there were no significant differences in the clinical finding of the circulatory shock and the volume deficit of the circulated blood between these two groups of patients. Group 1 patients had lower values of the cardiac index (CI) and the systemic oxygen transport (DO2). In them there was a greater frequency of acute organic insufficiency, especially pulmonal, renal and hepatal. In the initial status VO2 decreased. In the normovolemic status of Group 1, a significant VO2 was found, while in Group 2 in spite of a DO2 increase and hemodynamics improvement, a more significant VO2 increase was not obtained. As VO2 is an objective indicator of oxidative metabolic reactions of the organism and the circulatory system, the authors maintain that by the VO2 tracing, a better insight into the seriousness and course of the disease is obtained, and that an inadequate VO2 finding during the therapeutic treatment requires a revision of the treatment."
CD009647,0,4010649,0,Relationship of renal prostaglandins to distal transport of sodium chloride in normokalemic and hypokalemic man.,"The relationship between renal prostaglandins (PG) and electrolyte transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TALH) was examined in 8 normal subjects and in 7 patients with hypokalemia, the latter including 4 cases of Bartter's syndrome. Distal fractional delivery and distal reabsorption of chloride and sodium were determined using clearance techniques under maximal volume expansion, and urinary excretion rates of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha were measured. In the normal subjects, suppression of PG synthesis by indomethacin decreased distal delivery without changing distal reabsorption, suggesting that PG may influence solute transport at a site proximal to the diluting segment. In the subjects with Bartter's syndrome, however, distal reabsorption was impaired, this defect being apparently independent of PG as it was unaffected by inhibition of PG synthesis. In the patients with hypokalemia due to non-renal causes, distal reabsorption of chloride was increased, resulting in a decreased chloride clearance. These results suggest a link between renal PG and solute transport in normal man and also provide evidence that Bartter's syndrome is characterized by a prostaglandin-independent defect in distal reabsorption which is not found in hypokalemia due to other causes."
CD009647,0,2884861,0,Comparative effects of doxazosin and hydrochlorothiazide on serum lipids and blood pressure in essential hypertension.,"The efficacy and safety of doxazosin (mean dosage 6.9 mg, range 1 to 16) in the treatment of essential hypertension were compared in a double-blind study with those of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (mean dosage, 84.6 mg, range 25 to 100) in 104 hypertensive patients treated once daily for 6 months. Thirty-five patients were also assessed for comparative effects of the 2 agents on serum lipid parameters. Doxazosin produced potentially favorable changes from baseline in the concentrations of serum lipid fractions (total triglycerides, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and the derived HDL/total cholesterol ratio) compared with HCTZ. The decreases in total triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations and an increase in the HDL/total cholesterol ratio were significantly different (p less than 0.006) from the opposite changes observed with HCTZ. Clinically relevant decreases from baseline in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours after administration did not significantly differ between the 2 agents. The incidence and severity of side effects were similar for both drugs. Three patients receiving doxazosin and 6 receiving HCTZ were withdrawn due to drug-related clinical side effects including 2 patients receiving HCTZ who were withdrawn because of laboratory test abnormalities. Eight HCTZ- and 1 doxazosin-treated patients developed hypokalemia and 6 HCTZ-treated patients developed hyperuricemia. These findings indicate that doxazosin and HCTZ provide comparable antihypertensive efficacy after 6 months of treatment using a once-daily regimen, but doxazosin produces a beneficial effect on the serum lipid profile as well as fewer biochemical aberrations."

Among them, reduction of arterial pressure and an improvement in echocardiographic parameters stand out. In diabetic patients, icodextrin has additional potential advantages related with better metabolic control. In a multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial, the effects of icodextrin solutions were compared to glucose solutions on echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, and blood pressure changes in diabetic patients on PD. Two phases were noted in the follow-up. In the early phase (6 months), reduction in ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and left ventricular end diastolic diameter were found in the icodextrin group. These changes correlated with changes in body fluids. In the late phase (12 months), a trend towards baseline values in ABP was seen. Changes in inferior vena cava diameter and in low frequency R-R variability spectral analysis in the icodextrin group suggest that icodextrin increases circulating blood volume and sympathetic tone, probably by accumulation of icodextrin metabolites in the bloodstream and improvement in diabetic neuropathy as a result of lower peritoneal glucose absorption. The effects of icodextrin in diabetic patients were related to better fluid management and metabolic control."

CD009647,0,8399572,0,Indirect measures of total body water may confound precise assessment of peritoneal dialysis adequacy.,"Urea kinetic modeling (UKM) has yet to be optimized as a practical tool for assessing adequacy of therapy in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Watson equation (WV) and 58% body weight (58%WT) estimates of total body water (TBW) are indirect measures likely to yield imprecise estimates of Kt/V. Bioelectrical impedance (BEI) measures body composition as a function of electrical conductance, minimizing fat contribution to TBW. TBW values were highest when measured as 58% WT and lowest when calculated from WV. These differences were most striking in patients with overweight body habitus. BEI-derived TBW correlated best with UKM values. The relationship between BEI-derived and anthropometrically derived TBW was best in patients of normal habitus. Kt/V values were highest when calculated from WV-derived volumes and significantly differed from Kt/V values calculated from BEI-derived and 58%WT volumes. When segregated by habitus, however, only in overweight patients was this pattern of clinical significance. Serial body weight, lean body mass, and TBW remained stable in patients of normal habitus. Overweight patients increased weight by 5%, lean mass by 2%, and TBW by 5%, 3%, and 2% when measured by 58%WT, WV, and BEI respectively. BEI measures of TBW exclude fat mass and thus strengthen the use of Kt/V for assessing dialysis adequacy in CAPD patients of all body weights."

CD009647,0,17306903,0,Comparison of different methods to assess body composition of weight loss in obese and diabetic patients.,"Estimating body composition is important to understand the metabolic and cardiovascular effects of adiposity. Estimating changes in body compartments arising from weight loss strategies is equally important to evaluate their benefits and risks, particularly in frail populations (elderly or diabetic), and following bariatric surgery. Body compartments were evaluated in 50 obese subjects (25 diabetic, 25 non-diabetic) before and after a 7 kg weight loss obtained after 6 months of calorie restriction and orlistat. Fat and fat-free mass (FFM) were estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), plethysmography (BodPod) and a combination of these in a 3- or 4-compartment model, the latter being considered the reference method. FFM hydration was the ratio of total body water (BIA) to FFM. FFM hydration was significantly higher than classical values (75.9+/-3.0%, P<0.0001), and decreased with weight loss (74.2+/-3.3%). Compared to the 4-compartment, the 3-compartment model gave the most accurate fat and FFM estimation. A significant bias was observed with DXA, BodPod or BIA. Compartment changes induced by weight loss were accurately evaluated by DXA, being particularly precise in the 3-compartment analysis. No effect of diabetes per se was observed. A 3- or 4-compartmental analysis is necessary to accurately estimate body composition and its changes during weight loss."

CD009647,0,3538938,0,[Glucose-potassium-insulin in hypodynamic septic shock].,"Haemodynamic and metabolic effects of glucose-potassium-insulin (GKI) were studied in 14 patients with peritonitis. Study entry criteria were: hypodynamic septic shock (mean arterial pressure less than 50 mmHg and cardiac index less than 3.5 l/min) despite a highly positive fluid balance (greater than +2,000 ml during the last 12 h) and use of catecholamines (greater than 15 mcg/kg/min Dobutamine). GKI (glucose 70% 1 g/kg + potassium 10 mval + insulin 1.5 U/kg) was infused within 15 min via a central venous catheter. Before and 10 min after GKI haemodynamic and metabolic measurements were performed. GKI led to significant increases in systolic (+53%) and mean (+61%) arterial pressures, cardiac index (+50%), right (+60%) and left (+109%) ventricular stroke work indices, and oxygen consumption index (+18%). Heart rate remained unchanged, pulmonary shunt fraction increased slightly, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances showed an insignificant decline. Serum glucose (p less than 0.01) and pCO2 (p less than 0.1) increased. The haemodynamic improvement lasted from 30 min or less (n = 3; 21%) to several hours. Nine patients (64%) survived more than 2 days, and two patients (14%) were eventually discharged from the hospital. We conclude, that in hypodynamic septic shock refractory to volume loading and catecholamine treatment GKI may be beneficial, although the mechanism of action remains unclear."

The concentrations of cortisol, aldosterone, renin (PRA), vasopressin (ADH) parathyroid hormone (PTH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and growth hormone (GH) were determined in venous blood samples drawn from the patients upon admission, during, and after treatment. Highly elevated PRA mean values (396.77 +/- 88.58-462.18 +/- 106.95 ng.ml-1.h-1) were recorded, with no statistically significant difference between the readings. A similar trend was seen for cortisol (42.92 +/- 4.30-60.20 +/- 11.90 ug/dl). Vasopressin (ADH) showed a highly elevated value upon admission (42.48 +/- 18.82 pg/ml), which decreased to 23.66 +/- 8.27 pg/ml during treatment, and declined further to 7.67, ranging between 4.04 and 11.30 pg/ml, thereafter. Statistically speaking, however, there was no significant difference between these readings. PTH concentration, on the other hand, increased from an initial value of 143.31 +/- 47.64 to 245.90 +/- 107.34 pmol/l after treatment, but again there was no significant difference between the values.

Aldosterone concentration was significantly reduced in the patients upon admission, with an initial value of 187.93 +/- 21.41 pg/ml (p < 0.05 as compared to normal mean value). During and after treatment, aldosterone values were still significantly lower than normal mean (152.63 +/- 13.47, p < 0.05; 145.2 +/- 17.55, p < 0.01, respectively), thereby shedding some light on the possible etiology of persistent metabolic acidosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,1881579,0,Fluid balance during haemodialysis and haemofiltration: the effect of dialysate sodium and a variable ultrafiltration rate.,"One of the main causes of hypotension during extracorporeal renal replacement therapy is an insufficient substitution of the ultrafiltrated plasma water by tissue water. To investigate the fluid balance and its effects on hypotension in dialysed patients, the following variables were studied: intracellular fluid volume (IFV) and extracellular fluid volume (EFV), blood volume (BV) and blood pressure. IFV and EFV were measured by means of non-invasive electrical conductivity measurements using four electrodes round the leg. Fifteen haemofiltration (HF) and 15 haemodialysis (HD) patients were studied. The latter group was dialysed in three ways: (1) conventionally, i.e. with dialysate sodium of 138 mmol/l (HD) (2) with a variable dialysate sodium (first half: 138 mmol/l; second half: 146 mmol/l) (HDS), and (3) with the same variable dialysate sodium and an ultrafiltration profile (two-thirds was withdrawn during the first half of treatment, the remainder during the second half) (HDSU). Hypotension frequency was less during HDS, HDSU, and HF compared to HD. This was caused by a more stable blood volume due to a better refill. During HD a fluid shift occurred from the EC to the IC compartment. The use of a high sodium dialysate concentration led to a transcellular fluid shift in the opposite direction. This fluid shift increased the refill, thereby stabilising blood volume. HF gave a better refill than HDS and HDSU, probably due to a reduced urea clearance."

CD009647,0,2954723,0,Clinical application of atrial natriuretic polypeptide in patients with congestive heart failure: beneficial effects on left ventricular function.,"Synthetic alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide was infused in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association class III or IV) and in those without CHF. The infusion of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) at a rate of 0.1 microgram/kg/min significantly decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and increased stroke volume index in all of the patients with CHF, whereas it decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure but caused no significant change in stroke volume index in the patients without CHF. Concomitant significant reductions in total systemic resistance were observed in both groups of patients. The ANP infusion significantly increased the urine volume, the excretion of sodium, and endogenous creatinine clearance in the patients without CHF. In the patients with CHF, it also showed a tendency to increase all these variables, but the urine volume did not correlate with the reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The ANP infusion also decreased plasma aldosterone concentrations in these patients, although no significant difference was observed in the decrement of the plasma aldosterone concentration in the patients with and those without CHF. These findings indicate that the ANP infusion improves left ventricular function in patients with CHF, and suggest that this improvement results mainly from the vasodilating activity of ANP."

CD009647,0,20122539,0,Refeeding syndrome: treatment considerations based on collective analysis of literature case reports.,"Refeeding syndrome (RFS) represents a group of clinical findings that occur in severely malnourished individuals undergoing nutritional support. Cardiac arrhythmias, multisystem organ dysfunction, and death are the most severe symptoms observed. As the cachectic body attempts to reverse its adaptation to the starved state in response to the nutritional load, symptoms result from fluid and electrolyte imbalances, with hypophosphatemia playing a central role. Because guidelines for feeding the malnourished patient at risk for refeeding syndrome is scarce, we have provided management recommendations based on the knowledge derived from a collection of reported English literature cases of the RFS. A MEDLINE search using keywords including ""refeeding syndrome,"" ""RFS,"" and ""refeeding hypophosphatemia"" was performed. References from initial cases were utilized for more literature on the subject. We have emphasized the continued importance of managing patients at risk for RFS, compared how management of the severely malnourished patients have evolved over time, and provided comprehensive clinical guidelines based on the sum of experience documented in the case reports for the purpose of supplementing the guidelines available. Based on our review, the most effective means of preventing or treating RFS were the following: recognizing the patients at risk; providing adequate electrolyte, vitamin, and micronutrient supplementation; careful fluid resuscitation; cautious and gradual energy restoration; and monitoring of critical laboratory indices."
CD009647,0,16922178,0,Heat illness during working and preventive considerations from body fluid homeostasis.,"The purposes of this review are to show pathophysiological mechanisms for heat illness during working in a hot environment and accordingly provide some preventive considerations from a viewpoint of body fluid homeostasis. The incidence of the heat illness is closely associated with body temperature regulation, which is much affected by body fluid state in humans. Heat generated by contracting muscles during working increases body temperature, which, in a feedback manner, drives heat-dissipation mechanisms of skin blood flow and sweating to prevent a rise in body temperature. However, the impairment of heat-dissipation mechanisms caused by hard work in hot, humid, and dehydrated conditions accelerates the increase in body temperature, and, if not properly treated, leads to heat illness. First, we overviewed thermoregulation during working (exercising) in a hot environment, describe the effects of dehydration on skin blood flow and sweating, and then explained how they contributes to the progression toward heat illness. Second, we described the advantageous effects of blood volume expansion after heat acclimatization on temperature regulation during exercise as well as those of restitution from dehydration by supplementation of carbohydrate-electrolyte solution. Finally, we described that the deteriorated thermoregulation in the elderly is closely associated with the impaired body fluid regulation and that blood volume expansion by exercise training with protein supplementation improves thermoregulation."

CD009647,0,3863050,0,Hyponatraemic-hypertensive syndrome due to unilateral renal ischaemia in women who smoke heavily.,"The hyponatraemic-hypertensive syndrome due to renal ischaemia is presumed to be uncommon. We describe four patients who presented with this syndrome over a period of 21 months. All were women who smoked heavily and had unilateral atherosclerotic renal ischaemia. Hypokalaemia was present in each patient, and in one case resulted in recurrent ventricular tachycardia. All had noted thirst, polyuria, and weight loss. Initiation of treatment with a converting-enzyme inhibitor reduced arterial pressure precipitously in two patients. Removal of the ischaemic kidney, or chronic therapy with a converting-enzyme inhibitor reversed the biochemical abnormalities and the presenting symptoms, and lowered arterial pressure. Detailed studies in two patients before and after treatment confirmed the central role of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of the hyponatraemic-hypertensive syndrome."
CD009647,0,3953316,0,An evaluation of ultrafiltration as treatment of therapy-resistant cardiac edema.,"In six patients with therapy-resistant cardiac edema, ultrafiltration on two consecutive days removed on an average 7750 ml fluid and reduced body weight by 7.3 kg. A difference between the mean ultrafiltration rate (17.4 ml/min) and the calculated plasma refilling rate (12.7 ml/min) led to a reduction in plasma volume during treatment together with an increase in plasma colloid osmotic pressure. Systemic blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output were unchanged during ultrafiltration while systemic vascular resistance increased and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and right atrial pressure decreased significantly. No complications were recorded during or after treatment. Ultrafiltration is a safe method of fluid removal in patients with therapy-resistant cardiac edema and can be used as preparation for cardiac catheterization or surgery."
CD009647,0,16488346,0,"Artificial hydration therapy, laboratory findings, and fluid balance in terminally ill patients with abdominal malignancies.","To explore the association between hydration volume and laboratory findings, and between calculated fluid balance and changes in clinical signs of dehydration and fluid retention in terminally ill cancer patients, a secondary analysis of a large multicenter, prospective, observational study was performed. The study enrolled 125 abdominal cancer patients who received laboratory examinations in the last week before death. Patients were classified into two groups: the hydration group (n = 44), who received 1L or more of artificial hydration per day both 1 and 3 weeks before death, and the nonhydration group (n = 81). The mean albumin level 1 week before death was significantly lower in the hydration group than in the nonhydration group, and the interaction between hydration group and decrease in the albumin level was statistically significant after adjusting multiple covariates (from 2.8 +/- 0.68 mg/dL 3 weeks before death to 2.4 +/- 0.56 mg/dL 24 hours before death in the hydration group vs. a decrease of 2.8 +/- 0.53 to 2.6+ /- 0.45 mg/dL in the nonhydration group, P = 0.015). There was no significant difference between the groups in the mean blood urea nitrogen/creatinine, sodium, or potassium levels 1 week before death. Among 53 patients who had oral fluid intake of less than 500 mL/day throughout the last 3 weeks and completed a fluid balance study, the median of calculated fluid balance was -400 mL/day 3 weeks before death, -521 mL/day 1 week before death, and -421 mL/day 24 hours before death. Calculated fluid balances did not significantly differ between the patients with deterioration of dehydration signs, edema, ascites, and pleural effusion during the final 3 weeks and those without. These data suggest that active artificial hydration might result in hypoalbuminemia, with no clear beneficial effects on normalizing blood urea nitrogen/creatinine, sodium, or potassium levels. Fluid balance did not significantly correlate with changes in dehydration-and fluid retention-signs. Calculated fluid balance is not an appropriate alternative to direct monitoring of patient symptoms. More studies are needed to determine the clinical efficacy of artificial hydration for terminally ill cancer patients."
CD009647,0,6455834,0,[Effects of cyproterone acetate on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with carcinoma of the prostate (author's transl)].,"15 patients with advanced carcinoma of the prostate were studied in a prospective trial during treatment with 200 mg cyproterone acetate daily by mouth. Changes in variables (salt-water balance, antithrombin III, fibrinolytic activity, plasma lipoproteins) known to influence the risk of cardiovascular complications were recorded during the initial two months. Blood and plasma volume were unchanged, whereas the 24 h urine volume and the urinary sodium excretion were transitory increased. The body weight was decreased. The antithrombin III concentration and the fibrinolytic activity were increased. The lipoprotein fractions HDL and LDL and the HDL/LDL quotient decreased. The recorded changes of cardiovascular risk factors indicate that the risk of water retention and thereby congestive heart failure is not increased during cyproterone acetate treatment. The risk for thrombembolic disease is rather decreased. The small changes in lipoprotein fractions can hardly affect the incidence of cardiovascular disease in elderly men with prostatic carcinoma."

CD009647,0,19247271,0,Resistance training preserves fat-free mass without impacting changes in protein metabolism after weight loss in older women.,"This study assessed the effects of resistance training (RT) on energy restriction-induced changes in body composition, protein metabolism, and the fractional synthesis rate of mixed muscle proteins (FSRm) in postmenopausal, overweight women. Sixteen women (age 68 +/- 1 years, BMI 29 +/- 1 kg/m(2), mean +/- s.e.m.) completed a 16-week controlled diet study. Each woman consumed 1.0 g protein/kg/day. At baseline (weeks B1-B3) and poststudy (weeks RT12-RT13), energy intake matched each subject's need and during weeks RT1-RT11 was hypoenergetic by 2,092 kJ/day (500 kcal/day). From weeks RT1 to RT13, eight women performed RT 3 day/week (RT group) and eight women remained sedentary (SED group). RT did not influence the energy restriction-induced decrease in body mass (SED -5.8 +/- 0.6 kg; RT -5.0 +/- 0.2 kg) and fat mass (SED -4.1 +/- 0.9 kg; RT -4.7 +/- 0.5 kg). Fat free mass (FFM) and total body water decreased in SED (-1.6 +/- 0.4 and -2.1 +/- 0.5 kg) and were unchanged in RT (-0.3 +/- 0.4 and -0.4 +/- 0.7 kg) (group-by-time, P < or = 0.05 and P = 0.07, respectively). Protein-mineral mass did not change in either group (SED 0.4 +/- 0.2 kg; RT 0.1 +/- 0.4 kg). Nitrogen balance, positive at baseline (2.2 +/- 0.3 g N/day), was unchanged poststudy. After body mass loss, postabsorptive (PA) and postprandial (PP) leucine turnover, synthesis, and breakdown decreased. Leucine oxidation and balance were not changed. PA and total (PA + PP) FSRm in the vastus lateralis were higher after weight loss. RT did not influence these protein metabolism responses. In summary, RT helps older women preserve FFM during body mass loss. The comparable whole-body nitrogen retentions, leucine kinetics, and FSRm between groups are consistent with the lack of differential protein-mineral mass change."
CD009647,0,10326419,0,Fluid balance assessment. The total perspective.,"Fluid balance assessment is a fundamental aspect of caring for critically ill patients who often have volume disturbances. Since the introduction of hemodynamic monitoring in the critical care setting decades ago, we have become more dependent on technology to assist us in evaluating a patient's fluid status and less skilled in basic physical examination and interpretation of common blood and urine values. Information obtained from these basic clinical skills is equally as, if not more, important as numbers derived by invasive means."
CD009647,0,10913037,0,Weight stability masks sarcopenia in elderly men and women.,"Skeletal muscle loss or sarcopenia in aging has been suggested in cross-sectional studies but has not been shown in elderly subjects using appropriate measurement techniques combined with a longitudinal study design. Longitudinal skeletal muscle mass changes after age 60 yr were investigated in independently living, healthy men (n = 24) and women (n = 54; mean age 73 yr) with a mean +/- SD follow-up time of 4.7 +/- 2.3 yr. Measurements included regional skeletal muscle mass, four additional lean components (fat-free body mass, body cell mass, total body water, and bone mineral), and total body fat. Total appendicular skeletal muscle (TSM) mass decreased in men (-0.8 +/- 1.2 kg, P = 0.002), consisting of leg skeletal muscle (LSM) loss (-0.7 +/- 0.8 kg, P = 0.001) and a trend toward loss of arm skeletal muscle (ASM; -0.2 +/- 0.4 kg, P = 0.06). In women, TSM mass decreased (-0.4 +/- 1.2 kg, P = 0.006) and consisted of LSM loss (-0.3 +/- 0.8 kg, P = 0.005) and a tendency for a loss of ASM (-0.1 +/- 0.6 kg, P = 0.20). Multiple regression modeling indicates greater rates of LSM loss in men. Body weight in men at follow-up did not change significantly (-0.5 +/- 3.0 kg, P = 0.44) and fat mass increased (+1.2 +/- 2.4 kg, P = 0.03). Body weight and fat mass in women were nonsignificantly reduced (-0.8 +/- 3.9 kg, P = 0.15 and -0.8 +/- 3.5 kg, P = 0.12). These observations suggest that sarcopenia is a progressive process, particularly in elderly men, and occurs even in healthy independently living older adults who may not manifest weight loss."

CD009647,0,8446267,0,Natriuretic and vasoactive hormones and glomerular hyperfiltration in hyperglycaemic type 2 diabetic patients: effect of insulin treatment.,"Evidence that an increase in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations mediates, at least in part, glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetic rats prompted us to study the relationship between ANP and renal haemodynamics in hyperfiltering type 2 diabetic patients in association with other hormones implicated in the control of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (catecholamines, vasopressin, renin) and in sodium tubular transport (aldosterone, ouabain-displacing factor, ODF). Since hyperglycaemia is also associated to hyperfiltration, diabetic patients who presented with secondary drug failure were studied both in hyperglycaemic and in normoglycaemic condition. For this purpose, 11 normotensive non-macroproteinuric hyperfiltering patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with an 8-day continuous insulin infusion (days 0-7). Dehydration was prevented or corrected and natriuresis was on day 0 above 100 mmol/day. The following parameters were determined on days 0 and 7: GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) by 99mTc-DTPA and 131I-hippuran clearances; the extracellular volume, assimilated to the DTPA diffusion volume; urinary ODF by receptor-binding assay and urinary as well as plasma catecholamines by HPLC after extraction on alumin. Plasma ANP and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) were measured by radioimmunoassay after extraction on phenyl-silylsilica (ANP) and with ether (ADH). Unextracted plasma was used for radioimmunological measurement of plasma renin activity and aldosterone. When correcting hyperglycaemia to normoglycaemia GFR decreased from high to normal mean value (138 +/- 27 and 115 +/- 6 ml/min, p < 0.001), RPF followed the same trend, and the DTPA diffusion volume did not change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,15207441,0,Maximizing outcome of dementia treatment: the role of nutrition.,"The dementia syndromes are multifactorial regarding etiology, prevention, diagnosis,therapy, and rehabilitation, which include genetics, histopathology, biochemistry as well as sociopsychology, clinical medicine and caring sciences. This review concentrates on nutritional aspects. This includes body composition, where sarcopenia and water deprivations are important issues. Body weight and body water decrease with age which together with the well-known deterioration of thirst perception in old age may give rise to e.g., circulatory collapse and confusion, which is such a common symptom in the elderly not the least in demented patients. We have shown that an improved meal environment in nursing home patients markedly improves the psychosocial and nutritional situation. Aspects on feeding behavior have been shown to be important as well. Epidemiologically, recent 18-year longitudinal data from the gerontological and geriatric population studies in Göteborg, Sweden(H70) suggest that overweight at high ages is a risk factor for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, in women. Furthermore, overweight and obesity are important contributors to the presence of white matter lesions in the elderly."
CD009647,0,1826125,0,Atrial natriuretic peptide in dialysis patients under various conditions of volume homeostasis.,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were studied in 19 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under haemodialysis (HD). On the basis of clinical findings, patients were divided into three groups: group A, 6 patients, of mean age 41 +/- 15 years, without heart failure and in need of ultrafiltration (658 +/- 282 ml h-1); group B, 6 patients, of mean age 54 +/- 15 years, without heart failure under isovolaemic HD; group C, 7 patients, of mean age 60 +/- 3 years, with heart failure (NYHA III-IV) and in need of ultrafiltration (607 +/- 120 ml h-1). The highest predialysis ANP levels were found in group C (1534 +/- 471 pg ml-1) followed by group A (476 +/- 168 pg ml-1) and group B (236 +/- 138 pg ml-1) (normal range 62 +/- 27 pg ml-1). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate did not correlate with ANP levels in either of the groups. However, iso-osmotic reduction of the body weight by ultrafiltration was correlated with decreasing ANP levels during HD (for groups A and C, r = 0.88 and 0.98, respectively). Isovolaemic HD did not alter ANP concentrations (group B). All patients received a volume bolus at the end of HD, and they responded with an instant increase in ANP concentration, which was most pronounced in patients with concomitant heart failure. PRA was not significantly correlated with ANP levels during HD. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that there is a sensitive response of ANP levels to changes in body fluid status in ESRD."

All patients had a brisk diuresis within 24 hours and a mean weight loss of 8.9 kg (3 to 20 kg) until discharge. All patients improved considerably by additional metolazone-therapy. Seven patients developed a mild hyponatraemia (122 to 132 mmol/l), seven showed mild (greater than or equal to 3.2 mmol/l) and one had a serious hypokalaemia (2.8 mmol/l); spironolactone-pretreated patients developed no hypokalaemia. Notably none of the patients had serious blood pressure fluctuation or a deterioration of renal function.

Acute renal failure was due to trauma in 9 patients, occurred after surgery in 7 patients and was related to septicaemia in 5 patients, peritonitis in 2 patients and pancreatitis in one patient; in one patient acute renal failure developed during pregnancy after preexisting renal disease. Seventeen patients were oliguric and 8 patients were non-oliguric, with a mean daily urine output of 507 +/- 407 ml. At the start of CAVH the serum creatinine level was 511 +/- 198 mumol/l. The duration of treatment with CAVH was 1 to 36 days (average 9.3 days). Access to the circulation was by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein in 23 patients and by Scribner shunt in 2 patients. After an initial systemic dose of 2000 IU heparin, a continuous infusion of 250-1000 IU/hr into the arterial blood line was administered, adjusted to a partial thrombin time of 58 +/- 28 sec. With this heparin regimen a single haemofilter could be used for an average time of 2.6 +/- 1.2 days. The mean spontaneous filtration rate was 6 +/- 2 ml/min, resulting in the following serum levels: creatinine 490 +/- 187 mumol/l; urea 39 +/- 12.5 mmol/l; potassium 4.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/l. Nine catheter-associated complications occurred in 5 patients. The most important aspect of CAVH was its simplicity, optimal control of fluid balance and the possibility of unlimited parenteral nutrition. Uremia was adequately and continuously controlled.

CD009647,0,22827296,0,In vitro and in vivo assessment of the effect of Laurus novocanariensis oil and essential oil in human skin.,"Laurus novocanariensis is an endemic plant from the Madeira Island forest that derives a fatty oil, with a strong spicy odour, from its berries that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine to treat skin ailments. This work aimed to investigate the effect of the application of both the oil and its essential oil on normal skin, to assess their safety and potential benefits. Diffusion studies with Franz cells using human epidermal membranes were conducted. The steady-state fluxes of two model molecules through untreated skin were compared with those obtained after a 2-h pre-treatment with either the oil or the essential oil. Additionally, eleven volunteers participated in the in vivo study that was conducted on the forearm and involved daily application of the oil for 5 days. Measurements were performed every day in the treated site with bioengineering methods that measure erythema, irritation and loss of barrier function. Slightly higher steady-state fluxes were observed for both the lipophilic and the hydrophilic molecule when the epidermal membranes were pre-treated. Nevertheless, such differences had no statistical significance, which seems to confirm that neither the oil nor the essential oil impaired the epidermal barrier. Results collected with the Chromameter, the Laser Doppler Flowmeter and the visual scoring are in agreement with those established in the in vitro study. They indicate that the repeated application of the oil did not cause erythema, because the results observed in the first day of the study were maintained throughout the week. Application of the oil did not affect the skin barrier function, because the transepidermal water loss remained constant throughout the study. The stratum corneum hydration was slightly reduced on days 4 and 5. This work shows that both the oil and the essential oil were well tolerated by the skin and did not cause significant barrier impairment or irritation."

CD009647,0,1990105,0,A pharmacokinetic primer for intravenous nurses.,"Traditionally, drug doses and intervals between doses have been empirically decided by prescribers. Doses and intervals were subsequently adjusted based on observed efficacy or toxic effects. In the absence of consistent clinical findings or when the disease being treated is episodic in nature, such as in the case of asthma or epilepsy, optimal dosing is difficult to achieve. An alternative approach is the adjustment of doses based on the concentration of drugs in plasma. This approach has come to be called therapeutic drug monitoring, or TDM. To make adjustment of doses more efficient, mathematical models have been developed that describe and predict drug concentrations in various body fluids. These mathematical models incorporate pharmacokinetic parameters, such as volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, and clearance, which, when known for a particular patient or group of patients, allow judicious adjustment of doses of drugs that might otherwise be ineffective. This article reviews the model most commonly used in TDM and explains the parameters associated with it. It also considers the importance of TDM in clinical practice and the role of the nurse in this aspect of patient care."
CD009647,0,7373676,0,Water metabolism and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) response following thermal injury.,"ADH has been implicated in the development of a positive water balance in thermal injury. However, the association of plasma ADH levels to the hemodynamic response and water and electrolyte balance of early thermal injury has not been defined. Plasma ADH was measured by radioimmunoassay in 13 patients with greater than 15% body surface area burns. In three patients frequent hemodynamic measurements were also made. Large individual variations of ADH were noted, but in general the ADH levels peaked early in the postburn period and declined thereafter. The highest mean ADH value was on day 2 (53.8 = 27 pg/ml); the lowest value on day 7 (13.4 +/- 8 pg/ml). Urine electrolytes demonstrated wide variation (Na+, 2 to 236 mEq/L; K+, 2 to 228 mEq/L) as did serum (261--331 mOsm/kg) and urine (557--785 mOsm/kg) osmolalities. No correlation was noted between ADH levels and osmolalities or hemodynamic variables. These data suggest that ADH response following burns is a stress response producing levels beyond the physiologic range for an antidiuretic effect and that the osmolar, hypovolemic, and hypotensive feedback loops are not involved: ADH seems to act as a vasoconstrictor and to have no significant effect on quality or quantity of urine. We conclude that the positive water balance following burns is not ADH mediated."

CD009647,0,18770483,0,[The kidneys and old age].,"With more detailed knowledge on renal function at advanced age it became clear that age-related changes of renal function are less severe than previously thought. However, these changes are significantly aggravated by classical cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and smoking. As a consequence, in elderly with such co-morbidity the appearance of a primary kidney disease or acute renal failure may cause a serious deterioration of renal function. In addition, impaired homeostasis with respect to salt (and fluid) balance has important consequences for the management of the elderly who is exposed to the twin risks of dehydration and fluid overload. Finally, the kidney is the main route of excretion for many drugs and their active metabolites. Diminution of renal function with age underlies, at least in part, the known predisposition of the elderly to side effects of their medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."
CD009647,0,18336739,0,Increase of skin-ceramide levels in aged subjects following a short-term topical application of bacterial sphingomyelinase from Streptococcus thermophilus.,"Several studies have demonstrated that ceramides play an essential role in both the barrier and water-holding functions of healthy stratum corneum, suggesting that the dysfunction of the stratum corneum associated with ageing as well that observed in patients with several skin diseases could result from a ceramide deficiency. In a previous study our group reported a significant increase in skin ceramide levels in healthy subjects after treatment in vivo with a cream containing a preparation of Streptococcus thermophilus. The presence of high levels of neutral sphingomyelinase activity in this organism was responsible for the observed increase of stratum corneum ceramide levels, thus leading to an improvement in barrier function and maintenance of stratum corneum flexibility. The aim of the present work is to investigate the effects of the topical treatment of a Streptococcus thermophilus-containing cream on ceramide levels of stratum corneum of healthy elderly women. The ceramide levels, transepidermal water loss and capacitance were evaluated on stratum corneum sheets from the forearms of 20 healthy female subjects treated with a base cream or the same cream containing a sonicated preparation of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus. A 2-week topical application of a sonicated Streptococcus thermophilus preparation led to significant and relevant increase of stratum corneum ceramide levels. Moreover, the hydration values of the treated forearm of each subject was significantly higher than control sites. These results suggest that the experimental cream was able to improve the lipid barrier and to increase a resistance against ageing-associated xerosis."
CD009647,0,3918091,0,Oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide elimination after acetazolamide in the critically ill.,"Acetazolamide, which reversibly inhibits carbonic anhydrase, is a useful diuretic in alkalotic and over-hydrated patients. In two earlier investigations we have consistently found increases in the arterial and venous oxygen saturation and tension when patients were treated with acetazolamide 15 mg . kg-1. A plausible explanation of this phenomenon is that acetazolamide diminishes oxygen consumption. In the present study we measured oxygen uptake in 10 critically ill patients. We found a minor and statistically insignificant decrease in oxygen consumption. Nevertheless SVO2 increased from 0.77 to 0.83 and PVO2 from 5.9 kPa to 6.8 kPa. It is still not possible from this investigation to determine the origin of the improvement in blood oxygenation. The inhibition of carbonic anhydrase caused a CO2 retention of 5.8% of the total CO2 production. An increase in body stores of CO2 of this magnitude is without clinical significance."

CD009647,0,7437994,0,Long-term lithium treatment and the kidney. Interim report on fifty patients.,"This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long-term lithium treatment on the kidney. Creatinine clearance, maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long-term lithium for more than one year. These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to lithium, available for most of our patients. No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during lithium treatment. Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre-lithium values. Urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients. The concentration defect appeared reversible, at least in part. Polyuria above 3 litres/24 hours was found in 10% of patients. An attempt is made to draw practical conclusions from the preliminary findings."

We therefore constructed an ANN to predict intracellular water (ICW) volume in 44 healthy Taiwaners. Demographic and anthropometric data were recorded as predictors, and ICW volume measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (ICW-BIA) was the reference. ICW volume predicted by ANN (ICW-ANN) was compared with ICW-BIA. ICW-BIA (21.26 +/- 0.58 l) and ICW-ANN (21.25 +/- 0.57 l) was insignificantly different (p = 0.76). ICW-BIA and ICW-ANN were strongly correlated (r = 0.94, p < 0.0001) with a significant agreement (mean difference, 0.01; lower and upper limits of agreement, -2.31 and 2.33) in Bland-Altman plot. Passing-Bablok regression was described as ICW-BIA = 1.04 x ICW-ANN - 0.49, with 95% confidence interval for slope 0.94-1.14 and for intercept -2.76-1.49, indicating that both methods were interchangeable.

CD009647,0,20339358,0,Bioimpedance analysis parameters and epicardial adipose tissue assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in patients with heart failure.,"There is increasing evidence that body composition should be considered as a systemic marker of disease severity in congestive heart failure (CHF). Prior studies established bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as an objective indicator of body composition. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) quantified by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the visceral fat around the heart secreting various bioactive molecules. Our purpose was to investigate the association between BIA parameters and EAT assessed by CMR in patients with CHF. BIA and CMR analysis were performed in 41 patients with CHF and in 16 healthy controls. Patients with CHF showed a decreased indexed EAT (22 ± 5 vs. 34 ± 4 g/m(2), P < 0.001) and phase angle (PA) (5.5° vs. 6.4°, P < 0.02) compared to healthy controls. Linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation of CMR indexed EAT with left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF) (r = 0.56, P < 0.001), PA (r = 0.31, P = 0.01), total body muscle mass (TBMM) (r = 0.41, P = 0.001), fat-free mass (FFM) (r = 0.30, P = 0.02), and intracellular water (ICW) (0.47, P = 0.0003). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that LV-EF was the only independent determinant of indexed EAT (P < 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated good predictive performance of PA and EAT (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.86 and 0.82, respectively) with respect to cardiac death. After a follow-up period of 5 years, 8/41 (19.5%) patients suffered from cardiac death. Only indexed EAT <22 g/m(2) revealed a statistically significant higher risk of cardiac death (P = 0.02). EAT assessed by CMR correlated with the BIA-derived PA in patients with CHF. EAT and BIA-derived PA might serve as additional prognostic indicators for survival in these patients. However, further clinical studies are needed to elucidate the prognostic relevance of these new findings."

CD009647,0,16649177,0,Correlation of swelling pressure and intrafibrillar water in young and aged human intervertebral discs.,"Fluid balance in the intervertebral disc under applied load is determined primarily by its swelling pressure, that is, the external pressure at which it neither loses nor gains water. This depends on the composition of the tissue, in particular on its proteoglycan concentration. Proteoglycans develop a high osmotic pressure due to their fixed negatively charged groups. Because of their size, proteoglycans are excluded from the collagen's intrafibrillar volume; hence their osmotic activity is determined only by the extrafibrillar water. Here, we show that in order to evaluate correctly the swelling pressure in the annuli fibrosi of human intervertebral disc, it is essential to evaluate its proportion of intrafibrillar water. We used low-angle X-ray scattering and osmotic stress techniques to determine the lateral packing of the collagen molecules in the fibrils of the annuli fibrosi (ages: 25-77). It was found that the lateral packing and, hence, the intrafibrillar water content depends on age, external osmotic pressure, and location in the tissue. Subtracting intrafibrillar water from total hydration yields the amount of extrafibrillar water, from which the true fixed charge density of the tissue could be estimated. From a force balance, it would appear that collagen tension plays only a minor role in the equilibrium of the human intervertebral disc under load, in contrast to articular cartilage, where collagen tension is important for load bearing."

CD009647,0,9639350,0,Daily patterns of secretion of neurohypophysial hormones in man: effect of age.,"The neurohypophysial hormone vasopressin contributes to control of urine output and, while urine flow shows a clear daily rhythm, there has been debate as to whether this is true of neurohypophysial hormones. A study was performed on fifteen adult males, with a mean age of 25 years, over a 24 h period, nine blood samples being taken at regular intervals for the determination of neurohypophysial hormones and indices of fluid balance. Samples were taken via an indwelling cannula so that sleep was undisturbed. A daily variation in the plasma concentrations of oxytocin and vasopressin was demonstrated with concentrations reaching a nadir in the late afternoon. Concentrations of both hormones peaked at 02.00 h. Vasopressin concentrations were inversely correlated with packed cell volume, indicating that the altered hormone release was affecting fluid retention. Consistent with this was the observation that the relationship of plasma osmolality to vasopressin depended on the time of day. To determine the effect of ageing, a similar study was performed on nine healthy elderly subjects with a mean age of 70 years. The nocturnal peak of vasopressin was markedly attenuated, while oxytocin release was similar to that in the younger group. These observations confirm the existence of a daily rhythm in the plasma concentrations of neurohypophysial hormones and indicate that the amplitude of the vasopressin change decreases with age."

CD009647,0,3608389,0,Substantial effect of acute hydration on blood pressure in patients with autonomic failure.,"The effect of acute hydration on arterial blood pressure levels was investigated in ten patients with severe postural hypotension due to autonomic failure. Blood pressure and heart rate were determined in the supine and 60-degree head-up tilted position. Plasma volume and left ventricular ejection fraction were measured in the supine position. Measurements were repeated after rapid infusion of 11 of isotonic saline. Acute hydration resulted in increased supine mean blood pressure levels (P less than 0.01) despite normal plasma volumes in all patients. The postural reductions in mean blood pressure were reduced from 40 mmHg before to 20 mmHg after saline (median values, P less than 0.01). The results indicate that normal plasma volumes do not ensure optimal circulatory status in patients with autonomic failure. Acute hydration with isotonic saline may be used for immediate corrections of blood pressure levels in patients with autonomic failure and the response to acute hydration may be used as an indicator of the circulatory status in these patients."

Physical findings on admission showed BMI of 20.9, blood pressure of 147/69 mmHg, and that she had ciliac, axillar and pubic hair loss. Laboratory findings showed that plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 4.6 pg/mL with serum cortisol of 1.2 µg/dL. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were markedly reduced. Serum growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 were 0.054 ng/mL and 25 ng/mL, respectively. Serum prolactin was as high as 85.6 ng/mL.

Side-effects were generally mild and transient, except for polyuria which was noted in all three groups but more commonly in the piretanide group. Two patients were withdrawn because of side-effects: one patient in the high dose HCT group developed severe postural symptoms; and one patient in the low dose HCT group was withdrawn because of restlessness, nausea, weakness, dizziness and somnolence. All three treatments caused a significant increase in serum uric acid concentrations. Four patients in each of the HCT groups developed hypokalaemia, but no patients in the piretanide group did so."

CD009647,0,19259043,0,New experiences with the therapy of acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is encountered in a variety of settings (e.g., hospitalized and outpatient, non-intensive and intensive care unit patients, pediatric, adult, and elderly), with varied clinical manifestations ranging from a minimal elevation of serum creatinine (SCr) to anuric renal failure and/or multi organ failure (MOF), and a wide variation in causes, risk factors and comorbiditis. There is no hard and fast rule as to when renal replacement therapy (RRT) should be initiated, but is clearly not sensible to wait until an obvious uremic complication arises. Modern practice is to initiate RRT sooner rather than later, for example, when the SCr concentration reaches 500-700 micromol/L, perhaps even earlier, unless there is clear evidence that renal function is about to recover. The choice of the treatment will depend on the clinical practice, technical resources, and well-trained nurses of a given department, than on precise clinical indication. The ideal RRT should mimic the functions and physiological mechanisms of the native organ, ensuring qualitative and quantitative blood purification, be free of complications, have good clinical tolerance and restore and maintain homeostasis, thus favouring organ recovery. Now available RRT options /peritoneal dialysis (PD), 2. intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), 3. continuous therapies (CRRT), and 4. hybrid therapies/, differ in the method of delivery, efficiency, and their clinical tolerability. AKI without MOF is less complex, can be managed outside intensive care unit and the same RRT techniques used for the treatment of chronic renal failure may be applied. AKI associated with MOF is a more complex condition and requires more flexible RRT. Acute PD remains a viable option for the treatment of selected patients with AKI, particularly pediatric population, and those who are hemodynamically compromised, have severe coagulation abnormalities, difficulty in obtaining blood access, removal of high molecular weight toxins (> 10 kD), and clinically significant hypothermia and hyperthermia. Patients that are hemodynamically stable can be managed with IHD techniques. Maintaining hemodynamic stability is probably one of the most important aspects of dialysis technique as well as one of the most difficult challenges. With CRRT, the continuous regulation of volume homeostasis could lessen the hourly rate of required UF, thereby improving hemodynamic stability compared with IHD. Clinical data suggest that CRRT should be strongly considered for patients with severe hyperphosphatemia, elevated intracranial pressure, cerebral edema complicating acute liver failure, sepsis or septic shock, might be a useful component of therapy for lithium intoxication, and because of continuous nature of process prevents the post-dialytic ""rebound"" elevation of plasma concentration of uremic toxins typically seen with IHD. Hybrid therapies using a variety of machines are safe and convenient, providing excellent control of electrolytes and fluid balance, and offers several advantages over CRRT, including less cumbersome technique, patient mobility, and decreased requirements for anticoagulation, while providing similar hemodynamic stability and volume control. Currently, it has been found no difference in mortality or renal recovery between hybrid RRT, CRRT or IHD for critically ill patients with AKI. However, future investigations should collect detailed information on long-term costs and the relative likelihood of renal recovery associated with dialysis modality."
CD009647,0,17972337,0,Model for end-stage liver disease score and systemic inflammatory response are major prognostic factors in patients with cirrhosis and acute functional renal failure.,"Although it is often functional at presentation, acute renal failure has a poor prognosis in patients with cirrhosis. The role of inflammation, a key event in the outcome of cirrhosis, has never been studied in this setting. We aimed to investigate the predictive factors of mortality in patients with cirrhosis and acute functional renal failure, specifically in relation to inflammatory events. One hundred consecutive patients with cirrhosis from 5 French hospitals were prospectively included at the day of onset of acute renal failure. Medical history, treatments, and procedures during the month before inclusion were recorded. Physical examination, blood and urinary chemistries, and renal ultrasound examination were performed. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), infection, and sepsis was assessed. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The mechanism of renal failure was functional in 83 patients. Causes of renal failure were hypovolemia (34%), hepatorenal syndrome without ongoing infection (17%), hepatorenal syndrome with ongoing infection (16%), nephrotoxicity (2%), and multifactorial (31%). SIRS was observed in 41% of patients, 56% of them with infection. In-hospital mortality was 68% in patients with SIRS and 33% in patients without (P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, only model for end-stage liver disease score and presence of SIRS, but not infection, remained associated with a poor outcome."
CD009647,0,2007221,0,Endocrine crises. Hypoglycemia.,"Hypoglycemia is defined as the occurrence of a wide variety of symptoms in association with a plasma glucose level of 40 mg/dL or less. The conditions associated with hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients include exogenous insulin administration, ethanol, drugs (especially chlorpropamide), renal insufficiency, liver disease, infections, total parenteral nutrition, treatment of hyperkalemia with insulin, extensive burns, neoplasia, pregnancy, and a wide variety of less common causes. Although clinical features are helpful in making a diagnosis, a significant proportion of the patients are either asymptomatic or present with symptoms of altered mental status. The diagnosis of hypoglycemia should be considered in all hospitalized patients presenting with adrenergic or neuroglycopenic symptoms and signs suggestive of hypoglycemia. A detailed history along with a physical examination and appropriate laboratory investigations usually identify the specific cause of the hypoglycemia. An episode of hypoglycemia, especially if severe, should be treated with prolonged intravenous infusion of glucose. Prompt recognition and management of hypoglycemia are necessary to prevent significant morbidity and mortality."

CD009647,0,9372692,0,A prospective study of patients with lung cancer and hyponatremia of malignancy.,"This study was undertaken to define the impact of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on sodium homeostasis in patients with lung cancer. Patients had their serum and urine electrolytes and osmolality determined before and after a saline infusion of 500 ml. The plasma hormones, AVP, ANP, plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II, and aldosterone were determined by radioimmunoassay every 15 min before, during and after the saline infusion. Fifty patients, 31 with small cell lung cancer and 19 with non-small cell lung cancer participated in this trial. All 11 patients (10 patients with small cell lung cancer and one patient with non-small cell lung cancer) who presented with hyponatremia had inappropriately elevated levels of AVP. Elevated plasma AVP levels were highly correlated with the presence of hyponatremia (p < 0.00001). Initial plasma ANP levels were not associated with hyponatremia (p = 0.73). Urinary sodium concentration increased during the saline infusion proportional to the initial plasma level of ANP (p = 0.0045). AVP appears to be elevated in nearly all patients with hyponatremia of malignancy. ANP plasma levels in patients with lung cancer are associated with the ability to excrete a sodium load but do not appear to downregulate renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone production."
CD009647,0,3770957,0,Occupational fluoride exposure and plasma fluoride levels in man.,The individual fluoride exposure and the corresponding body fluid levels were studied in 41 workers in an aluminum plant in Sweden. During the shift (8 h) personal air samplings were performed and plasma fluoride levels determined. Pre- and post-shift urine fluoride excretion were also measured. The average total fluoride exposure was 0.91 mg/m3 of which 34% was gaseous fluoride (mean value 0.31 mg/m3). The mean fluoride plasma level before the shift was 23 ng/ml (1.2 microM/l) and increased on average to 48 ng/ml (range 14-151 ng/ml) at the end of the shift. The plasma levels found were in no case remarkably high. There was a high correlation between fluoride renal clearance and urinary flow (r = 0.481; n = 38; P = 0.00232). A high fluid intake during the shift will thus increase the capacity of the kidney to excrete fluoride and decrease the levels of fluoride in the body. There was a significant correlation between the amount of gaseous fluoride and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (r = 0.459; n = 40; P = 0.0029) and also the amount of fluoride excreted (r = 0.530; n = 40; P = 0.0004). When fluoride exposure and body burden are to be studied on an individual basis these two parameters give better quantitative information and are to be recommended instead of urine fluoride concentration measurements. The prevention of fluoride inhalation by using a safety-mask during the shift was also demonstrated. The workers who used a safety-mask during the whole shift reduced the inhalation of fluoride to 30 to 40% compared to those who did not use any mask.
CD009647,0,8630514,0,Body composition and energy expenditure in thyroidectomized patients during short-term hypothyroidism and thyrotropin-suppressive thyroxine therapy.,"Thyroid hormone levels are a major determinant of energy balance and are thought to modify body composition by their effects on metabolism of lipids, carbohydrate and protein. The present study evaluates changes of body composition and basal energy expenditure (BEE) in thyroidectomized patients studied during short-term profound hypothyroidism while off all thyroid hormone before diagnostic whole-body (131)I-imaging and while on thyrotropin-suppressive thyroxine therapy. Basal energy expenditure was assessed by indirect calorimetry, and four-point body impedance analysis was used to estimate body composition. Patients were compared with healthy controls matched with respect to sex, age, height and weight. Compared to healthy controls the percentages of body water and body cell mass were significantly lower while the percentage of fat was significantly higher in patients during short-term hypothyroidism. Weight did not change significantly when patients were put on thyroxine treatment, but body fat (-0.95 +/- 2.25 kg, p < 0.01) decreased while body water (+0.94 +/- 1.31 kg, p < 0.01) and body cell mass (+0.9 +/- 2.5 kg, p < 0.05) increased. With thyroxine replacement, body composition was not significantly different between patients and controls. Compared to healthy controls, BEE was significantly lower in patients without thyroxine replacement (5265 +/- 766 kJ/24h vs 6362 +/- 992 kJ/24h; p < 0.001). With thyroxine treatment, BEE increased (6492 +/- 967 kJ/24h) but was not significantly different from the controls (p > 0.05). Neither body composition nor BEE was significantly different in a subgroup of thyroxine-treated patients with free triiodothyronine or thyroxine values above the normal range. In conclusion, both body composition and energy expenditure showed significant changes when patients were deprived of thyroid hormone. However, no evidence of excess metabolic effects of thyroid hormone during thyrotropin-suppressive thyroxine therapy was found."

After a 3-wk placebo lead-in period, the subjects entered a 6-wk treatment period. The two drug regimens were compared with respect to antihypertensive effects and effects on serum potassium and magnesium levels during the final week of drug therapy, with the use of the last week of placebo therapy as a covariate. Both drug regimens substantially reduced mean supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures to well within normal limits; there was no significant difference the two groups. Twenty-four of the 41 subjects receiving triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide (59%) and 29 of the 43 patients receiving amiloride-hydrochlorothiazide (67%) had diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg at week 9. Five subjects receiving amiloride-hydrochlorothiazide (12%) and two subjects receiving triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide (5%) had hypokalemia (serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/l) at week 9. The average decrease in serum potassium levels during amiloride-hydrochlorothiazide therapy (-0.33 +/- 0.08 mEq/l) was greater than that after triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide (- 0.08 +/- 0.07 mEq/l). Serum magnesium levels were not changed by either regimen. Weight loss was greater in the amiloride-hydrochlorothiazide group than in the triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,9972188,0,Water: an essential but overlooked nutrient.,"Water is an essential nutrient required for life. To be well hydrated, the average sedentary adult man must consume at least 2,900 mL (12 c) fluid per day, and the average sedentary adult woman at least 2,200 mL (9 c) fluid per day, in the form of noncaffeinated, nonalcoholic beverages, soups, and foods. Solid foods contribute approximately 1,000 mL (4 c) water, with an additional 250 mL (1 c) coming from the water of oxidation. The Nationwide Food Consumption Surveys indicate that a portion of the population may be chronically mildly dehydrated. Several factors may increase the likelihood of chronic, mild dehydration, including a poor thirst mechanism, dissatisfaction with the taste of water, common consumption of the natural diuretics caffeine and alcohol, participation in exercise, and environmental conditions. Dehydration of as little as 2% loss of body weight results in impaired physiological and performance responses. New research indicates that fluid consumption in general and water consumption in particular can have an effect on the risk of urinary stone disease; cancers of the breast, colon, and urinary tract; childhood and adolescent obesity; mitral valve prolapse; salivary gland function; and overall health in the elderly. Dietitians should be encouraged to promote and monitor fluid and water intake among all of their clients and patients through education and to help them design a fluid intake plan. The influence of chronic mild dehydration on health and disease merits further research."
CD009647,0,9790267,0,Effects of successful adenomectomy on body composition in acromegaly.,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate postsurgical change in body composition in patients who have undergone surgery for acromegaly. Eight patients with acromegaly had determination of serum GH, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), height, body weight, and bioelectric impedance before surgery and at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery. Body composition was analyzed by bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). We analyzed body fat (BF), body lean mass (BLM), body cell mass (BCM), total body water (TBW), intracellular water (ICW) and extracellular water (ECW). The serum GH concentration and IGF-I had decreased significantly 2 weeks after surgery. Body weight had decreased significantly 1 month after surgery and recovered 3 months after surgery. BIA showed that TBW and BCM had decreased significantly 2 weeks after surgery. BF gradually increased up to 1 month after surgery and was increased significantly at 3 months after surgery. The percent ratio of TBW/body weight decreased and the percent ratio of BF/body weight increased during the 6 months after surgery. The percent ratio of ECW/TBW did not change during the 6 months following surgery. In conclusion, the rapid body weight loss which occurred within 2 weeks after surgery was caused by decreases in TBW and BCM. The recovery of body weight, which was seen later than 1 month after surgery, was caused by an increase in BF. The postoperative change in body composition in acromegaly ceased 3 months after surgery."

In some cases, SE may proceed other parameters of sepsis. Loss of consciousness to a various extent is the leading symptom. CSF findings and CCT are usually unremarkable. EEG is a sensitive parameter to monitor SE. EEG-changes deteriorate in correspondence to the degree of SE. If sepsis can be treated successfully, clinical and electrophysiological signs are completely reversible. SE has a complex etiology. Bacterial endotoxins and other microbial products trigger the release of a multitude of mediators of sepsis. Due to liver dysfunction in sepsis, the brain neurotransmitter profile may be deranged. Other etiological factors include bacteriemia, liver or renal dysfunction, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycemia and drug effects. Due to the prognostic significance of early adequate treatment, recognition of SE as a possible initial sign may be crucial for patients with sepsis."
CD009647,0,22734626,0,The efficacy and safety of newer anticonvulsants in patients with dementia.,"Anticonvulsants are a class of medications that have received considerable interest as possible treatments in patients with behavioural disturbances in dementia. The role of these medications for such a use remains controversial. The current paper reviews the published evidence surrounding the safety and efficacy (i.e. as a behavioural and cognitive treatment) of newer anticonvulsants in patients with dementia. A MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO and clinicaltrials.gov search through to December 2011 was conducted for anticonvulsants that have received regulatory approval since 1996. Studies reporting behavioural or cognitive outcomes in patients with dementia were included. Nine trials involving only four medications met selection criteria and were included: levetiracetam (n = 4), oxcarbazepine (n = 1), topiramate (n = 2) and zonisamide (n = 2). Levetiracetam may have a role in the treatment of behavioural symptoms in dementia but study limitations substantially hinder the strength of such a recommendation. Oxcarbazepine and topiramate, based on limited data, do not appear to be effective treatments of behavioural symptoms in dementia. A lack of trials do not allow for conclusions to be made regarding zonisamide. From a cognitive standpoint, levetiracetam was the anticonvulsant most examined in patients with dementia, it appears to have less deleterious effects than some anticonvulsants. Limited data are available on the safety of these medications in elderly patients; however, studies completed thus far have demonstrated some adverse events that are more common or problematic with the use of these drugs in this patient population (i.e. somnolence, dizziness, hyponatraemia, weight loss)."

An oral acute water load (20 ml/kg body weight) was given to each of 12 patients before and after surgical removal of their aldosterone-producing adenoma(s). Plasma AVP and ANH were measured simultaneously, and renal water and electrolyte metabolism and tubular functions were determined. The same water load was given to seven normal subjects and the same parameters were determined. In the presence of mineralocorticoid excess before the operation, plasma AVP was relatively low compared with plasma osmolality (Posm), but was not suppressed in response to decreases in Posm after the water load. Baseline plasma ANH was high and increased further after the water load; urinary dilution and diuresis both remained normal. After the operation, baseline plasma AVP was normal and decreased in response to the decrease in Posm after the water load, with normal urinary dilution and diuresis. Baseline plasma ANH was normal, and did not increase after the water load. The ratio of urinary K and Na clearances and distal tubular reabsorption of Na increased before the operation. These results suggest that there are perturbations of AVP and ANH release in primary aldosteronism, despite the normal urinary dilution after a water load."

CD009647,0,18091397,0,"Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of orthostatic hypotension and vasovagal syncope.","Orthostatic hypotension (OH) occurs in 0.5% of individuals and as many as 7-17% of patients in acute care settings. Moreover, OH may be more prevalent in the elderly due to the increased use of vasoactive medications and the concomitant decrease in physiologic function, such as baroreceptor sensitivity. OH may result in the genesis of a presyncopal state or result in syncope. OH is defined as a reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing. A review of symptoms, and measurement of supine and standing BP with appropriate clinical tests should narrow the differential diagnosis and the cause of OH. The fall in BP seen in OH results from the inability of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to achieve adequate venous return and appropriate vasoconstriction sufficient to maintain BP. An evaluation of patients with OH should consider hypovolemia, removal of offending medications, primary autonomic disorders, secondary autonomic disorders, and vasovagal syncope, the most common cause of syncope. Although further research is necessary to rectify the disease process responsible for OH, patients suffering from this disorder can effectively be treated with a combination of nonpharmacologic treatment, pharmacologic treatment, and patient education. Agents such as fludrocortisone, midodrine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have shown promising results.

Body weight changed in a parallel manner with upright blood pressure, increasing in patients of group I and decreasing in patients of group II (p less than 0.05). Autonomic cardiovascular reflexes were significantly more impaired in patients of group II than in patients of group I. We conclude that midodrine is effective in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension only in those patients with significant preservation of autonomic reflexes. Conversely, in patients with markedly impaired baroreceptor mechanisms, treatment with midodrine may produce extracellular fluid volume depletion and exacerbate orthostatic hypotension."

CD009647,0,10789188,0,[Usefulness of bioelectric impedance as a method for evaluating body composition of patients on peritoneal dialysis].,"The aim of a study was to evaluate the usefulness of bioelectric impedance as a method of body composition analysis in patients treated with CAPD, with the special attention paid on hydration status and lean body mass. The values of parameters obtained by bioelectric impedance and other methods were compared. The impact of peritoneal dialysis fluid in peritoneal cavity on bioimpedance measurement results were also analyzed. The study was performed in 33 patients dialyzed with CAPD for mean period of 12.3 months, aged between 23 and 72 years (mean 50.9 years). Bioimpedance measurements were also performed in 10 healthy volunteers. The significant impact of 2-liters dialysate volume on measurement results was found. The percentage water contain as well as LBM are under this condition higher (59.2% vs. 58.3%; p < 0.005 and 80.73 vs. 79.6; p < 0.01, respectively), and body fat--lower (19.07 vs. 20.39%; p < 0.005) as compared to empty peritoneal cavity. We also found, that the values of body water obtained from BEI measurements are higher as compared to those calculated from Watson formulas and lean body mass values obtained from BEI analysis are higher as compared to those derived from creatinine kinetics (39.4 vs. 36.96 I.; p < 0.05 and 53.7 vs. 51.1 kg; p < 0.01, respectively). Total and lean body mass did not differ from the values predicted in the treatment group, however the percentage contain of body water was significantly higher (58.34 vs. 51.39%; p < 0.0001). No significant differences were found between body composition of CAPD patients and control individuals."
CD009647,0,9413765,0,Effects of distilled water and mixture of sorbitol-mannitol irrigation fluids on fluid-electrolyte balance in patients undergoing transurethral prostatectomy.,"This study aimed to compare two various irrigation fluids used in transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) with respect to changes in fluid-electrolyte balance and to evaluate the blood loss during TURP. TURP was performed in 50 patients using distilled water and in 42 patients using a mixture of sorbitol and mannitol solution (2.7% sorbitol and 0.54% mannitol) as irrigation fluid. Fluid-electrolyte changes and blood loss were evaluated. None of the patients had transurethral resection syndrome. Decline in serum sodium level was more significant in patients who were operated on with the sorbitol plus mannitol irrigation fluid in contrast to its clinical insignificance (p < 0.05). Decrease in serum sodium concentration in patients with more than 15 g of tissue resected was greater than in patients with less than 15 g of tissue resected (p < 0.05). Blood loss was greater in the distilled water group (p < 0.05). Blood loss was 145.5 +/- 3.4 ml in patients given a blood transfusion. In conclusion, a fluid containing mainly sorbitol must be the irrigation fluid preferred over distilled water because of its non-haemolytic nature, but although not important clinically, it can cause hyponatraemia more than distilled water. Furthermore, it is useful to determine blood loss during TURP before deciding to give a blood transfusion."
CD009647,0,15559741,0,Removal of glucose from the cardiopulmonary bypass prime: a prospective clinical audit.,"To quantify our decision for the removal of glucose and the use of mannitol as a substitute osmotic agent in the cardiopulmonary bypass prime, we conducted a prospective clinical audit to evaluate the effects of this change on patient outcomes. Data were prospectively collected for 172 consecutive routine cardiac surgery patients. The first 85 patients (Surgeon A, 42 patients [Group 1], Surgeon B, 43 patients [Group 2]) received 1000 mL Plasmalyte 148 + 5% glucose as per institutional protocol. The remaining priming volume for each group consisted of 500 mL hemaccel or 4% albumin, 50 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, 100 mL Hartmann's solution. The change to a glucose-free prime was then initiated, substituting Plasmalyte 148 (without 5% glucose) for the Plasmalyte 148 + 5% glucose, in addition 12.5 g mannitol was administered following delivery of cardioplegia to the patients operated on by Surgeon B. Surgeon A would not include mannitol at this time. Forty-one patients operated by Surgeon A (Group 3) subsequently received Plasmalyte 148, and 46 patients operated on by Surgeon B (Group 4) received Plasmalyte 148 plus mannitol. Analysis was performed stratified by surgeon to quantify the effects of removing glucose from the prime. Comparisons were made between groups 1 and 3, and 2 and 4. Net fluid changes were recorded from pre-CPB, up to 24-h postoperatively. Intraoperative data collection included serum glucose, hematocrit, osmolality, return to rhythm, arrhythmias, and blood transfusions. Post-operative variables, including cardiac enzymes, arrhythmias, intubation time, length of stay, and mortality were also collected. Removal of glucose from the CPB prime resulted in a lower serum glucose concentration (mmol/L) during CPB (Gp 1 [13.6] vs. Gp 3 [5.4]; Gp 2 [14.7] vs. Gp 4 [5.4], p < .05). The addition of 12.5 g of mannitol to the CPB prime resulted in a significantly lower net fluid gain (mL) 24 h postoperatively (Gp 2[2792] vs. Gp 4 [1970], p < .05) and greater CPB hematocrit (%) (Gp 2 [24.3] vs. Gp 4 [26], p < .05). No other results were found to be significant (except CPB plasma osmolality (Groups 2 and 4) and sodium concentration [Groups 1 and 3]). The results of our audit provide an evidence base to support our change in practice to utilize nonglucose primes."

CD009647,0,21163766,0,"[Metastatic prostate cancer complicated with chronic disseminated intravascular coagulopathy causing acute renal failure, mimicking thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome: pathomechanism, differential diagnosis and therapy related to a case].","Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is characterized as activation of the clotting system resulting in fibrin thrombi, gradually diminishing levels of clotting factors with increased risk of bleeding. Basically two types of DIC are distinguished: (1) chronic (compensated) - with alteration of laboratory values and (2) acute (non-compensated) - with severe clinical manifestations: bleeding, shock, acute renal failure (ARF), transient focal neurologic deficit, delirium or coma. Chronic DIC related to metastatic neoplasia is caused by pancreatic, gastric or prostatic carcinoma in most of the cases. Incidence rate of DIC is 13-30% in prostate cancer, among those only 0.4-1.65% of patients had clinical signs and symptoms of DIC. In other words, chronic DIC is developed in one of eight patients with prostate cancer. DIC is considered as a poor prognostic factor in prostatic carcinoma. The similar clinical and laboratory findings of TTP-HUS (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - hemolytic uremic syndrome) and DIC makes it difficult to differentiate between them. A 71 years old male patient with known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, significant carotid artery stenosis, gastric ulcer and alcoholic liver disease was admitted to another hospital with melena. Gastroscopy revealed intact gastric mucosa and actually non-bleeding duodenal ulcer covered by clots. Laboratory results showed hyperkalemia, elevated kidney function tests, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, increased liver function tests, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia and elevated international normalized ratio (INR). He was treated with saline infusions, four units of red blood cells and one unit of fresh frozen plasma transfusions. Four days later he was transported to our Institution with ARF. Physical examination revealed dyspnoe, petechiae, hemoptoe, oliguria, chest-wall pain and aggressive behavior. Thrombocytopenia, signs of MAHA (fragmentocytes and helmet cells in the peripheral blood), normal INR, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ARF suggested TTP-HUS. Hemodialysis and six plasmaferesis (PF) were carried out. After the fifth PF, skin manifestations of thrombotic microangiopathy occurred on the feet. Clotting analysis revealed elevated D-dimer (>5 μg/mL), normal fibrinogen (3.2 g/L), a slightly raised INR (1.36) and activated partial prothrombin time (APTT) (45.8 sec), normal reticulocyte (57 G/L) and a slightly low platelet count (123 G/L), which proved to be chronic DIC. Therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was started. Elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (109.6 ng/mL) suggested prostatic carcinoma. Prostate biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma (Gleason: 4+4 for left lobe and 3+3 for right lobe). Elevated alkaline phosphatase suggested metastases in the bone, which were confirmed by bone scintigraphy. Combined androgen blockade (CAB) was started. After three months follow-up our patient's status is satisfactory. PSA is in the normal range (4.6 ng/mL). Thrombocytopenia of uncertain origin with normal or raised INR, APTT, elevated D-dimer, normal fibrinogen and reticulocyte count prove the diagnosis of chronic DIC. This process warrants searching for metastatic neoplasia. Due to the relatively low serum levels of circulating procoagulant factors (e.g. tissue factor), therapeutic dose of LMWH can be used with good efficiency in chronic DIC with low risk of bleeding. Severe DIC as a complication of metastatic prostate cancer can be treated by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or CAB in combination with ketokonazole and concomitant use of supportive treatment.

CD009647,0,9061426,0,Total fluid balance during transurethral resection of the prostate.,"All fluids given and recovered during and for 24 hours following transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP) in 35 elderly men were recorded and compared with the health status of the patient. The results show that irrigating fluid absorption and the choice of a crystalloid or a colloid solution for intravenous fluid supplementation were the most important factors governing the total fluid balance at the end of TURP as well as 2 hours later. At 24 hours after the operation, the absorption of irrigating fluid during TURP and the presence of cardiac disease promoted retention of fluid. Impaired kidney function and serum cortisol concentration did not, however, correlate with the fluid balance."

CD009647,0,2966770,0,Atrial natriuretic factor in mild to moderate chronic renal failure.,"The relationship between kidney function and plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (irANF) levels as well as the effects of synthetic human ANF-(99-126) were investigated in 13 patients with mild to moderate chronic renal failure. Under basal conditions, glomerular filtration rate averaged 39 +/- 5 (SEM) ml/min/1.73 m2 and blood pressure (BP) averaged 166/107 +/- 7/2 mm Hg; 12 patients were hypertensive. Plasma irANF levels were significantly increased (98 +/- 16 vs 42 +/- 4 pg/ml in healthy control subjects; p less than 0.001) and correlated (p less than 0.05-0.005) inversely with hematocrit (r = -0.65) and positively with systolic BP (r = 0.75) or fractional sodium excretion (r = 0.75). Human ANF-(99-126) infusion for 45 minutes at 0.034 microgram/kg/min augmented (p less than 0.05-0.01) diuresis and urinary sodium, chloride, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium excretion. During the subsequent 45 minutes of human ANF-(99-126) infusion at a rate of 0.077 microgram/kg/min, diuresis and electrolyte excretion remained elevated (p less than 0.05-0.01). Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were not significantly modified, but filtration fraction rose progressively (p less than 0.01). Human ANF-(99-126) infusion decreased BP (p less than 0.05-0.01), produced hemoconcentration (hematocrit + 7%; p less than 0.01) without negative body fluid balance, and increased (p less than 0.01-0.001) plasma norepinephrine, insulin, and serum free fatty acids; plasma aldosterone and renin activity were unaltered during but rose after cessation of human ANF-(99-126) infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,17087599,0,Renal adrenomedullin and high altitude diuresis.,"Previous investigations revealed that most of the fluid regulating hormones showed no consistent relationship to the hypoxic diuretic response (HDR). In this study we examined if adrenomedullin (AM), a hypoxia-mediated diuretic/natriuretic peptide is connected to HDR. Thirty-three persons were examined at low altitude (LA), on the third exposure day at 3440 m (medium altitude, MA) and on the fourteenth day at 5050 m (high altitude, HA). Nocturnal diuresis rose from 460 ml [interquartile range 302 ml] at LA to 560 [660] ml at MA to 1015 [750] ml at HA (p<0.005). Sodium excretion was similar at LA and MA (41.8 [27.0] vs. 41.4 [28.4] mM) and increased to 80.2 [29.1] mM at HA (p<0.005). Urinary AM excretion was 7.9 [3.9] at LA, 7.5 [5.7] pM at MA, and increased to 10.5 [5.1] pM (p<0.05) at HA. Urinary AM excretion was correlated to diuresis (r=0.72, p<0.005) and sodium excretion (r=0.57, p<0.005). Plasma AM concentration rose from 16.4 [3.1] to 18.8 [4.9] pM/l at MA (p<0.005) and to 18.3 [4.3] pM/l at HA (p<0.005). Plasma AM concentration and urinary AM excretion were not correlated, neither were plasma AM concentration and diuresis or natriuresis. Our data suggest the involvement of increased renal AM production in the pathophysiology of high altitude fluid and sodium loss."

CD009647,0,9254093,0,Natriuretic peptide system and endothelin in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"The natriuretic peptide system consists of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). The system is implicated in the control of body fluid homeostasis, causes natriuresis and diuresis (ANP and BNP), and regulates vascular tone (CNP). A reciprocal relationship between ANP and endothelin (ET) has been suggested, and earlier studies have documented a possible role of ET in cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The authors studied plasma ANP, BNP, CNP, and ET for 6 consecutive days in 13 patients with SAH by using radioimmunoassay. The median admission values for ANP were 31.5 pg/ml (range 16.8-323 pg/ml [normal 15 +/- 7 pg/ml]); for BNP, 45.3 pg/ml (range 2.2-80.2 pg/ml [normal 12 +/- 9 pg/ml]); for CNP, 7.7 pg/ml (range < 2-20 pg/ml [normal 5.2 +/- 3 pg/ml]); and for ET, 11 pg/ml (range 6.5-25.1 pg/ml [normal 7.2 +/- 4 pg/ml]). Additional increases (defined as > 100% increase on two consecutive measurements) were noted in ANP (11 patients), BNP (10 patients), and CNP (three patients), and resulted in a negative fluid balance in 10 of the 13 patients. The CNP increased in three of four patients with cerebral vasospasm and in one of nine patients without cerebral vasospasm (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.2). No major fluctuations in plasma ET were noted. In seven patients, the plasma ET level did not increase beyond 10 pg/ml during the days of measurement. In six patients, only an occasional sample showed an increase to a maximum of 25 pg/ml. Changes in BNP, ANP, and CNP were independent of each other. The authors conclude that both plasma ANP and BNP increase after SAH and often result in a negative fluid balance. Plasma ANP and BNP seem differentially regulated in the presence of SAH but not by the level of the plasma ET. The possible role of CNP as a regulatory response to cerebral vasospasm needs further exploration."

CD009647,0,8938682,0,Fractional urea clearance in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: effects of volume disturbances.,"The effects of volume disturbances on the KT/V were investigated prospectively in 133 consecutive urea clearance studies on patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Four subjects (group A) had fluid loss (actual weight < dry weight), 57 (group B) were studied on the basis of their dry weight, 58 (group C) had moderate fluid excess (0.5% of dry weight), and 14 patients (group D) had severe fluid excess (> 5% of dry weight). The KT/V was calculated on the basis of dry weight and actual weight with V obtained from the Watson anthropometric formulae which were applied either uncorrected or with a correction for changes in body water from dry weight conditions. The groups compared by variance analysis. The following weekly KT/V estimates were obtained: (1) using dry weight V: group A 1.81 +/- 0.17, group B 2.0 +/- 0.59, group C 1.79 +/- 0.46, group D 1.85 +/- 0.37 (no difference between groups); (2) using uncorrected actual weight V: group A 1.85 +/- 0.15, group B 2.05 +/- 0.59, group C 1.77 +/- 0.45, group D 1.78 +/- 0.37 (group B had a higher KT/V than group C, p < 0.05), and (3) using corrected actual weight V: group A 1.93 +/- 0.14, group B 2.05 +/- 0.59, group C 1.70 +/- 0.43, group D 1.63 +/- 0.36, (group B had a higher KT/V than either group C or group D, both at p < 0.01). In CAPD, fluid deficit is rare and causes a small increase in KT/V, whereas fluid retention is frequent and causes a decrease in KT/V. This decrease is pronounced in patients with severe fluid excess. The uncorrected Watson formulae underestimate V and, consequently, overestimate KT/V in CAPD patients with fluid excess."

CD009647,0,7613258,0,Diagnostic value of plasma aldosterone/potassium ratio in hypoaldosteronism.,"The diagnosis of hypoaldosteronism usually depends upon a combination of abnormal clinical and laboratory findings. The most common abnormality in hypoaldosteronism is hyperkalemia, which may be combined with sodium depletion. In the present study, 5 of 16 patients diagnosed with isolated hypoaldosteronism (IHA) had sodium depletion due to renal salt wasting, and four patients had normokalemia. Of these 16 IHA patients, 70% had subnormal baseline and stimulated plasma renin activity (PRA). Six patients diagnosed with type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) had normal or high PRA and plasma aldosterone concentrations (PAC). In 11 control subjects, supine PAC correlated positively with serum potassium (SK), and PAC stimulated by furosemide and ambulation correlated with the 24-hour urinary potassium excretion (UK). However, these correlations were not found in IHA and PHA patients. The ratio of UK/UNa+K and UNa/UK correlated with the stimulated PAC when the IHA and control subjects were taken as a whole. However, these electrolyte excretion parameters bore no relationship to the supine PAC. The stimulated PAC/SK ratio was used to discriminate the three groups; all IHA patients had a ratio below 3. The results indicate that stimulated PAC reflects the bioactivity of aldosterone on the collecting tubule, and the stimulated PAC/SK ratio is useful for the diagnosis of hypoaldosteronism and pseudohypoaldosteronism."

On admission to the hospital she was comatose, clinically dehydrated, and had laboratory values consistent with a water deficit of approximately 30% (9 L) of body water. Serum sodium concentration was 202 mEq/L. Serum osmolality was 430 mOsm/L. The patient remained comatose for seven days, during which time she was vigorously treated with fluids, and she gradually recovered.

Diuretics and vasodilators were withheld and a sodium (Na+)-restricted diet was initiated. All patients exhibited positive Na+ balance at the time of evaluation. Hourly urine volumes, urine chemistries, serum chemistries, PAH and inulin/iothalamate clearances were determined 2 h pre and 4 h post a single 200 mg oral dose of ibopamine. Effective renal plasma flow, creatinine clearance, filtration fraction, and the fractional excretion of sodium and potassium were not significantly altered postdose. A significant increase in urine output and decrease in urine osmolality were seen at all time points postdose. A significant reduction in serum potassium (2 and 3 h) and blood urea nitrogen (1, 3 and 4 h) concentrations occurred. Measurements of glomerular filtration rate by inulin or [125I]-iothalamate produced differing results in the patient groups studied. We conclude that a single dose of ibopamine does not produce significant improvements in renal function in patients with congestive heart failure, mild renal insufficiency and positive sodium balance."

CD009647,0,3966494,0,Effect of hypoxemia on sodium and water excretion in chronic obstructive lung disease.,"To determine the role of hypoxemia in the pathogenesis of impaired sodium and water excretion in advanced chronic obstructive lung disease, 11 clinically stable, hypercapneic patients requiring long-term supplemental oxygen were studied. The renal, hormonal, and cardiovascular responses to sodium and water loading were determined during five-and-a-half-hour studies on a control day (arterial oxygen tension = 80 +/- 6 mm Hg) and on an experimental day under hypoxic conditions (arterial oxygen tension = 39 +/- 2 mm Hg). Hypoxemia produced a significant decrease in urinary sodium excretion but did not affect urinary water excretion. Hypoxemia also resulted in concomitant declines in mean blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and filtered sodium load. Renal plasma flow and filtration fraction were unchanged whereas cardiac index rose. On the control day, plasma renin activity and norepinephrine levels were elevated whereas aldosterone and arginine vasopressin levels were normal; none of these four hormones was affected by hypoxemia. Renal tubular function did not appear to be altered by hypoxemia as there was no significant change in fractional reabsorption of sodium. The concurrent decreases in glomerular filtration rate, filtered sodium load, and mean blood pressure at constant renal plasma flow suggest that the reduction in urinary sodium excretion was due to an effect of hypoxemia on glomerular function, possibly related to impaired renovascular autoregulation."

We considered that his acute renal failure was attributable to rhabdomyolysis due to dehydration and that the cause of death was probably septic shock. The patient had a previous history of cholecystectomy ten years ago and also suffered from hypertension, but his general condition was not so bad before this episode. Therefore, we were surprised that his illness became so severe. This case emphasizes that Salmonella enteritis may occasionally be a serious and lethal disease."

If a facility had 3 or more hours of nursing assistant time versus those that had less than 3 hours, there was an associated odds ratio of 0.83 (P = .0078). Nursing assistant staffing affected the quality outcome of weight loss. Residents receiving at least 3 hours per day of nursing assistant care had a 17% decreased likelihood of weight loss."
CD009647,0,9394573,0,[Cardiac surgery in patients with chronic renal failure on maintenance dialysis].,"From July 1988 through August 1996, 54 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) on maintenance dialysis (50 hemodialysis = HD, and 4 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) have undergone some sort of surgical procedure requiring the use of extra corporeal circulation (ECC); 42 patients underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 8 valve replacement, 3 combined procedures and 1 correction of a congenital heart defect. The protocol called for maintenance dialysis on the day before surgery, large volume hemofiltration (HF) during the ECC period, postoperative K+ management with dextrose-insulin if required, and resumption of whatever preoperative maintenance dialysis 24 hours after the operative procedure. The mean diafiltrate volume of HF was 7963 +/- 2688 ml which was replaced with 6342 +/- 2748 ml. No patient required emergency HD before the resumption of the maintenance dialysis, although in 40% of the early patients HD was added on the second postoperative day. However as experience was gained, in the latter 60% of patients resumption of maintenance dialysis (HD 3 times a week) was thought to be sufficient. The incidence of calcification in patients with CRF is higher not only of involved coronary artery segments (4.5 +/- 2.3 segments; AHA coronary classification) than its counterpart without CRF, but also of the ascending aorta which mandated modifications of the technique in 6 patients (operation under ventricular fibrillation, cannulation access other than ascending aorta). The use of arterial in situ conduits for CABG was also thought to be advantageous, and the left internal thoracic artery combined to the gastro-epiploic artery was used in 11 patients (26.2%). Four patients died) (7.4%): 2 from arrhythmia, one from intestinal necrosis and one from multiple cerebral infarction. Thus we conclude that the outlined protocol is quite effective in controlling fluid and electrolyte balance in patients on maintenance dialysis allowing to undertake surgical procedures requiring the use of extra corporeal circulation relatively safely."
CD009647,0,11889304,0,Predictors and impact of atrial fibrillation after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting.,"Although an extensive number of studies have attempted to identify predictors of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AFIB) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), a strong predictive model does not exist. Prior studies have included patients recruited from multiple centers with variant AFIB prevalence rates and those who underwent CABG in combination with other surgical procedures. Also, most studies have focused on pre- and perioperative characteristics, with less attention given to the initial postoperative period. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively examine pre-, peri-, and postoperative characteristics that might predict new-onset AFIB in a large sample of patients undergoing isolated CABG in a single medical center, utilizing data readily available to clinicians in electronic data repositories. In addition, length of stay and selected postoperative complications and disposition were compared in patients with AFIB and no AFIB."
CD009647,0,6416193,0,The response to TPN. A form of nutritional assessment.,"Malnutrition in surgical patients is associated with an increased incidence of postoperative mortality and morbidity. Preoperative nutritional support has been shown to be efficacious in reducing the incidence of these complications, although the postoperative complication rate in these patients continues to be greater than in their wellnourished counterparts. This study attempts to determine whether the postoperative course can be either influenced by or predicted from the preoperative response to nutritional support. Thirty-two patients with nutritional depletion who received an average of 1 week of total parenteral nutrition prior to a major abdominal operation were studied. These patients were followed for postoperative complications. Of the 16 patients who exhibited the characteristic response to early nutritional support, diuresis of the expanded extracellular fluid compartment with a resultant loss of weight (127.9 +/- 5.7 to 124.6 +/- 5.8 (SEM) lbs, p less than .001) and rise in serum albumin (3.21 +/- 0.14 to 3.46 +/- 0.15 gms%, p less than 0.001), only one developed a complication in the postoperative period. The other 16 patients did not exhibit this response. They retained additional fluid, gained weight (119.3 +/- 8.1 to 121.3 +/- 8.2 lbs, p less than .025), and showed a decrease in serum albumin levels (3.14 +/- 0.14 to 3.00 +/- 0.14%), p less than 0.01). Eight of these patients developed a total of 15 postoperative complications (p less than 0.01). This study demonstrates that the response to preoperative TPN is an important factor in assessing operative risk and morbidity. The need to individualize preoperative nutritional support and the timing of surgical intervention is clearly demonstrated."
CD009647,0,21777511,0,Hyponatraemia during psychopharmacological treatment: results of a drug surveillance programme.,"Hyponatraemia (HN) can be a life-threatening medical condition which may lead to severe neurological and psychiatric symptoms. The AMSP (Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie) is a multicentre drug surveillance programme that assesses severe or new adverse drug reactions during psychopharmacological treatment in psychiatric inpatients. We report on a total of 263 864 psychiatric inpatients monitored from 1993 to 2007 in 80 psychiatric hospitals in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. During this period plasma sodium levels below 130 mmol/l (severe HN according to AMSP) were reported in 93 patients (relative frequency 0.04%). On average, the plasma sodium levels of all cases were 119.7 mmol/l (±5.8 s.d.); median 121 mmol/l (range 104-129 mmol/l). Patients who showed no clinical signs (n=65, 70%) had a mean sodium level of 121.3 mmol/l (±5.0 s.d.); median 122 mmol/l (range 114-129 mmol/l). By contrast, patients with clinical symptoms (n=28, 30%) had a mean sodium level of 116.0 mmol/l (±6.0 s.d.); median 117 mmol/l (range 104-125 mmol/l). HN was mainly observed during treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (0.06%), Serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (0.08%), carbamazepine (0.10%) and oxcarbazepine (1.29%); the highest rate was found for oxcarbazepine. Antipsychotics, mirtazapine and tricyclic antidepressants were only rarely involved in HN (0.003-0.005%). Combinations of several drugs known to induce HN significantly increased the risk of HN, e.g. more than 10-fold for SSRI+diuretics+ACE inhibitors (0.37%) vs. SSRI given alone (0.02%). This is clinically relevant because such combinations, e.g. SSRI+diuretics may occur especially in elderly patients, who are in general at higher risk of developing HN."

CD009647,0,8968973,0,Early physiologic patterns in acute illness and accidents: toward a concept of circulatory dysfunction and shock based on invasive and noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring.,"The aim of the present study was to explore methods, concepts, and techniques that provide recognition of circulatory deficiencies at the earliest possible time in the patient's illness. We used both the standard invasive pulmonary artery thermodilution catheter and noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring systems consisting of a new bioimpedance cardiac output device, pulse oximetry, transcutaneous oxygen (PtCO2) and carbon dioxide tensions as well as the transcutaneous oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PtCO2/FIO2). These three noninvasive systems were used to evaluate cardiac function, pulmonary function, and tissue perfusion, respectively. This approach to early noninvasive monitoring is based on recent evidence suggesting that poor tissue perfusion and oxygenation initiate circulatory dysfunction that leads to shock and organ failure. We studied 303 acute episodes of circulatory dysfunction and shock in 261 patients in a university-run county hospital; 75 were acute traumatic injuries and 109 acute nontrauma medical emergencies on admission to the emergency department, and 77 ICU patients with an acute illness or exacerbation of their current illness. The study was a prospective, descriptive study to identify early abnormal circulatory patterns reflecting the cardiac, pulmonary, and perfusion functions associated with death and with survival. We described noninvasively monitored patterns in individual illustrative cases, in common etiologic groups, and in physiologic categories representing various abnormal functional patterns. We found that hypotensive shock usually was preceded by episodes of high flow followed by low flow and inadequate tissue perfusion indicated by reduced PtCO2; this frequent pattern was modified by associated co-morbid conditions, especially hypovolemia, limited cardiac reserve capacity, age, hypertensive states, and increased body metabolism from infection, trauma, stress, exercise, temperature, and endocrine disorders. Reduced pulmonary function occurred in 18% of emergency patients; these were usually patients with thoracic trauma, severe hypovolemia, head injuries, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, drug overdose, and central nervous system failure (massive stroke and coma). We concluded that noninvasive measurements identify early circulatory problems reliably and provide objective criteria for physiologic analysis as well as for definition of therapeutic goals and titration of therapy."

CD009647,0,2228410,0,Prediction of body water and fat in adult Danes from measurement of electrical impedance. A validation study.,"The purpose of the present study was to test the validity of the electrical impedance method for estimation of total body water and lean body mass in adult Danes with large differences of obesity and fat distribution, and to develop algorithms for estimation of body water, lean body mass and fat from measurement of impedance. The results of the electrical impedance method were compared in 139 Danes aged 35-65 years, to those of a four-compartment-model based on measurements of both total body potassium (whole body counting) and total body water (dilutometry). The comparison confirmed the validity of the impedance method. Equations for predicting body water and lean body mass in Danes are given. A significant difference was found between two instruments of the same model. In spite of the fact that the test resistance supplied by the manufacturer gave identical measurements, measurements on humans diverged on average by 31 ohm. A cross-validation study showed that most of the algorithms found in the literature for predicting lean body mass from impedance yield reliable results."

CD009647,0,1506810,0,"Treatment of orthostatic hypotension with sleeping in the head-up tilt position, alone and in combination with fludrocortisone.","We studied the effect of sleeping in the head-up tilt (HUT) position, alone and in combination with fludrocortisone, on orthostatic tolerance and blood pressure (BP) in six patients with hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension. A high salt diet of 150-200 mmol Na+ d-1 was also administered. Combined treatment reduced orthostatic dizziness in all patients (P less than 0.001), and increased the maximal standing period to at least 10 min. HUT alone (n = 4) reduced the BP decrease after 1 min of standing from -64/-42/-25 +/- 29/21/17 mmHg to -53/-37/-23 +/- 31/24/20 mmHg (P less than 0.01 for systolic BP). Addition of fludrocortisone to HUT (HUT/fludro) (n = 5) further reduced the BP decrease after 1 min of standing from -63/-40/-24 +/- 20/12/11 mmHg to -21/-19/-8 +/- 12/10/5 mmHg (P less than 0.05 for systolic, mean and diastolic BP, respectively). BP at maximal standing time increased from 58/47/42 +/- 9/8/7 mmHg initially to 95/69/57 +/- 27/22/20 mmHg during combined treatment (P less than 0.05 for systolic and mean BP), and remained unchanged during the 14-month (range 8-70 month) follow-up period. Nocturnal sodium excretion decreased from 8.0 +/- 2.3 mmol h-1 to 5.9 +/- 1.9 mmol h-1 with combined treatment; body weight increased by 1.6 kg on average (range 0.5-2.4 kg) (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the combination of HUT and fludrocortisone effectively minimizes orthostatic symptoms and increases orthostatic BP in patients with hypo-adrenergic orthostatic hypotension."

CD009647,0,16785150,0,Characteristic features of 20 patients with Sheehan's syndrome.,"Sheehan's syndrome occurs as a result of ischemic pituitary necrosis due to severe postpartum hemorrhage. The aim of the present study was to determine the clinical characteristics of Sheehan's syndrome in 20 patients (mean age 60.15 +/- 3.41 years) with typical obstetric history. The mean duration between time of diagnosis and date of the last delivery was 26.82 +/- 2.52 years (range 2-40 years). All patients had a history of massive hemorrhage at delivery and physical signs of Sheehan's syndrome. Fourteen patients (70.0%) lacked postpartum milk production and did not menstruate following delivery. Baseline and stimulated anterior pituitary hormone levels were measured in all patients. According to the hormonal values, 18 (90.0%) patients had secondary hypothyroidism, 11 (55.0%) had adrenal failure and all of them had hypogonadism, prolactin and growth hormone deficiency. Hyponatremia was present in seven patients (35.0%). Total or partially empty sella was revealed in all patients by magnetic resonance imaging. Diabetes insipidus was not found in any patient. We found that lack of lactation in the postpartum period and early menopause seemed the most important clues for diagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome, and inadequate prolactin and gonadotropin responses to stimulation tests were the most sensitive diagnostic signs in patients with severe postpartum hemorrhage."
CD009647,0,3192684,0,The effects of human growth hormone administration in elderly adults with recent weight loss.,"The effects of human GH administration in elderly adults with recent weight loss were investigated in a metabolic ward study. Four patients were studied for 20 days. In addition to a constant caloric and nitrogen-sufficient diet, consisting of the recommended amounts of protein and energy plus 20%, the patients received GH in dosages of 25 and 50 micrograms/kg.day for two 4-day periods (days 5-8 and 13-16, respectively). Significant increases in nitrogen retention of 1.6 (114.2) and 1.4 g/day (100 mmol/day), respectively, occurred compared with that in the control periods. No difference was found between the two GH dosages, but the nitrogen-retaining effect of the higher dose appeared to last for several days after its administration was stopped. Plasma insulin-like growth factor I levels rose during both treatment periods. No important disturbances in carbohydrate metabolism occurred. Body weight increased 2.3 kg during each treatment period, probably due to water retention. We conclude that even during more than adequate nutritional intake, low GH doses cause considerable nitrogen retention in underweight adults."
CD009647,0,3105319,0,Influence of mannitol and dopamine on renal function during elective infrarenal aortic clamping in man.,"The impact of elective infrarenal aortic clamping on parameters of renal function was evaluated in 27 extracellular fluid volume expanded patients. Significant transient decreases (p less than 0.05) in glomerular filtration rate were observed in all three groups either in the early or late post-clamp release period, despite maintenance of hemodynamic stability. This study documents transient decreases in glomerular filtration rate which occurred following release of the infrarenal aortic cross-clamp. No clinically important benefit from the use of mannitol and dopamine over extracellular fluid volume expansion with saline alone was demonstrated in the prevention of the changes in renal function associated with aortic cross-clamping."
CD009647,0,23210336,0,Aging and the kidney.,"The kidney undergoes functional and structural changes during the aging process. The factors influencing these changes are currently under active investigation. The renal functional reserve is diminished in the elderly predisposing these individuals to the development of acute kidney injury when the balance of vasconstrictive and vasodilatory hormones are altered, particularly with medications. The development of acute kidney injury in the elderly portends a negative prognosis for the recovery of renal function. The management of end stage renal disease in the elderly is also a topic of intense discussion and clinical investigation. In this review, we explore the mechanisms responsible for the aging of the kidney. We also summarize the renal hemodynamic changes, urine and concentration and dilution alterations, and the changes in sodium and potassium metabolism associated with aging. The role and the consequences of dialysis treatment in the elderly are also explored in this review article."

CD009647,0,12897642,0,Albuterol improves response to levodopa and increases skeletal muscle mass in patients with fluctuating Parkinson disease.,"Animal studies indicate that beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists enhance transport of levodopa across the blood-brain barrier. Preliminary studies showed improved response to levodopa in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) who were given albuterol as adjunctive therapy. Beta(2)-adrenergic agonists may offer additional benefits to PD patients via their skeletal muscle anabolic effects, particularly those who experience decreased muscle strength and weight loss. Nondemented, fluctuating PD patients receiving levodopa but not experiencing severe dyskinesias underwent the following tests at baseline and 14 weeks after treatment with albuterol sulfate (4 mg four times a day, orally): Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor, tapping, and stand-walk-sit tests every 30 minutes between 8 am and 5 pm; body composition analyses using whole-body plethysmography and computed tomography of the thigh; muscle strength tests; and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). Results were analyzed using paired t-tests (2 tailed), repeated-measures analysis of variance, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Seven of 8 enrolled patients completed the study; 1 patient withdrew because of headache and anxiety. The area under the curve for all-day UPDRS motor scores improved by 9.8 +/- 9.1% (mean +/- standard deviation; P < 0.05) and tapping improved by 7.6 +/- 8.1% (P < 0.05). The effect was more pronounced when only the response to the first levodopa dose (area under the curve, 8-11 am) was analyzed: 13.0 +/- 9.8% and 9.8 +/- 9.6% respectively. Thigh muscle cross-sectional area increased significantly as measured by computed tomography (5.3 +/- 3.2%, P < 0.01), as did fat-free mass by whole-body plethysmography combined with total-body water determination (9.5 +/- 2.9%, P < 0.05). There was no significant improvement in the stand-walk-sit test, muscle strength tests, other UPDRS sections, daily OFF time, or PDQ-39. Four patients were rated as having a mild global improvement (+1 point) on a -3 to +3-point scale, and 3 of them chose to continue albuterol beyond the termination of the study. The mean heart rate increased from 78.3 +/- 9.3 beats/minute to 85.6 +/- 8.7 beats/minute (P < 0.05). No laboratory abnormalities or electrocardiographic changes were induced by albuterol in any subject. This open-label pilot study suggests that albuterol increases muscle mass and improves the therapeutic response to levodopa in patients with fluctuating PD. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study is needed to confirm the effects and safety profile of beta(2)-agonists in PD."

CD009647,0,1826356,0,[Lumbar disk herniation with no surgical treatment. Clinical and x-ray computed tomographic follow-up study].,"The authors have studied the clinical and computed tomographic (CT) follow-up of 50 patients with nerve root symptoms and herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) who received only a conservative medical treatment. The clinical follow-up showed that after 23 months 38 patients (76 percent) did not require surgery and 63 percent of these had good or very good results. Follow-up CT scans, performed in 20 patients, found spontaneous disappearance of NP in 10 cases and partial regression in 3 cases. Several mechanisms may explain this regression, including fragmentation and sequestration of the disc fragment, dehydration and shrinkage of the HNP and its reintegration into the annulus. On the other hand, HNP persisted in some patients who had become asymptomatic, and it was also found in an asymptomatic control subject. These data demonstrate that clinical and CT findings may be dissociated. Not all CT scan-documented HNPs require interventional therapy. Except in case of emergency, surgical treatment should be considered only after failure of conservative medical treatment and whenever clinical and CT data are concordant. CT and other imaging procedures, such as myelography and nuclear magnetic resonance, should only be used preoperatively in patients with appropriate clinical findings."
CD009647,0,9437437,0,Clinicopathologic correlations of soluble amyloid beta-protein precursor in cerebrospinal fluid in patients with Alzheimer disease and controls.,"The authors compared concentrations of soluble beta-amyloid protein precursor (s beta PP) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 45 patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) and 26 normal older control volunteers. Soluble beta-amyloid protein precursor concentrations were measured in 125 CSF samples using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All subjects had Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDRS) scores and assessment of disease duration. The s beta PP concentrations in CSF in the probable AD group (mean +/- SD = 493 +/- 268 micrograms/L) were decreased significantly compared with the age-matched control group (mean = 831 +/- 302 micrograms/L; p < 0.0001). In the probable AD group, MMSE scores correlated positively with s beta PP concentrations (correlation coefficient r = 0.53, p < 0.0001), and CDRS ratings and disease duration correlated inversely with s beta PP concentrations (r = -0.59, p < 0.0001 and r = -0.479, p = 0.0006, respectively). Although the decrease in CSF s beta PP from levels found in healthy elderly controls was significant in AD subjects, there was substantial overlap. In AD, CSF s beta PP was most reduced in patients in later stages of the disease. The s beta PP concentrations reflect disease severity, but utility in differential diagnosis has not been determined."

CD009647,0,3706370,0,Hepatic involvement in systemic mast cell disease.,"Thirteen patients with systemic mast cell disease were studied in order to define the hepatic changes in this disease and to correlate the histologic lesions in the liver with the clinical findings. These patients often presented with multisystem disorders and 10 had hepatomegaly. Microscopically, the liver tissues in all patients showed fibrosis and chronic inflammatory cellular infiltration with plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mononuclear fibroblast-like cells in the portal area. The hepatic sinusoids were not significantly involved. A histologic diagnosis of systemic mast cell disease is seldom entertained in liver biopsy specimens embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylineosin, but can be facilitated in biopsy specimens embedded in plastic such as methacrylate. Tissue mast cells in the cellular infiltrate can be demonstrated best by special staining techniques with Giemsa, toluidine blue, and chloroacetate esterase. The severity of the histologic changes in the liver does not correlate well with the size of the liver or biochemical changes in the blood. Abnormal serum biochemical values were noted primarily in those with dehydration caused by diarrhea and vomiting, and in those with malnutrition. Hepatic function test results were usually normal, except for alkaline phosphatase level, which was elevated in all 13 patients. Although the clinical significance of hepatic involvement in systemic mast cell disease cannot be established with certainty in this study, it is believed that the prognosis of systemic mast cell disease is most intricately related to the systemic effects of mast cell involvement in many other organs, and not to hepatic involvement per se."

Forty-three patients with rectal cancer (stage T3/T4 (n = 24), metastatic (n = 17) and 2 with local recurrence), were included. The radiotherapy dose delivered was 45 Gy over 5 weeks (1.8 Gy/fraction/day, 5 days per week). The initial weekly oxaliplatin dosage was 30 mg/m2 and the 5FU dosage 150 mg/m2/d. The oxaliplatin and 5FU doses were escalated. Eight dose levels were tested. At dose level 8 (oxaliplatin 80 mg/m2, 5FU 225 mg/m2/d), 2 patients out of 4 presented dose-limiting toxicity (severe diarrhoea with dehydration and fatal shock, rectovesical fistula). At dose level 7, 2 further patients presented with grade 3 diarrhoea. The main toxicity of the combination was diarrhoea. The hematological and neurological toxicities were not severe and were not dose-limiting. Out of the 30 patients undergoing surgery, 4 (13.3%) presented with pathological complete response and 4 (13.3%) only presented with microscopic residual disease. The results from this study enabled determination of the recommended weekly oxaliplatin dose (60 mg/m2) combined with 5FU continuous infusion (225 mg/m2) and fractionated radiotherapy (45 Gy) in the pre-operative treatment of advanced rectal cancer. The good safety profile of the regimen, associated with promising results in terms of histological response, suggest that the regimen could be developed in future phase II/III studies."

CD009647,0,15672792,0,Thoracic impedance measurements during orthostatic change test and during hemodialysis in hemodialyzed patients.,"Measurements were performed before and after hemodialysis (HD) in the supine and upright positions (orthostatic change test) and during HD session every 30 minutes in recumbent position on 11 HD patients. Two hydration states were compared: hyperhydration and normal hydration. Each patient served as his own control. Blood pressure and total body bioimpedance were obtained simultaneously. Thoracic impedance values (Zo) obtained during HD were significantly greater in the normal hydration state. There was strong correlation between Zo gain and total ultrafiltration; however, Zo gain divided through total ultrafiltration (calculated for every 100 ml) was also higher in this state. The ratio Zo/R (where R is resistance of total body bioimpedance) was stable during HD but was significantly higher in the normal hydration state. Zo gain during the orthostatic change test was significantly higher after HD than before HD in both hydration states. The anticipated difference in Zo gains between both hydration states was not significant. After echocardiographic analysis of patients, we determined that cardiac dysfunction or valvular defects in four patients were likely responsible for opposite reaction on orthostatic change test. During our measurements, we observed the influence of Zo changes on episodes such as intradialytic hypotension or acute atrial fibrillation. Thoracic impedance is an intriguing method for controlling pathophysiology of fluid distribution, but it requires the accurate definition of a patient's hemodynamics and strong conditions during measurement. During our measurements, we observed the influence of such episodes as intradialytic hypotension or acute atrial fibrillation on Zo changes."

CD009647,0,9069446,0,Impact of profile haemodialysis on intra-/extracellular fluid shifts and the release of vasoactive hormones in elderly patients on regular dialysis treatment.,"In 15 patients with end-stage renal failure and proven coronary heart disease, profile haemodialysis with decreasing ultrafiltration rate and hyperionic, decreasing dialysate solute concentration was compared with conventional, extracorporeal bicarbonate haemodialysis (Na+D = 138 mmol/l). Body fluid distribution and the release of vasoactive hormones (plasma renin activity, aldosterone, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and atrial natriuretic peptide) were investigated. Haemodialysis with constant ultrafiltration rate and constant dialysate composition (A) was followed by two dialysis profiles: decreasing ultrafiltration rate (B) and additional hyperionic, decreasing dialysate sodium concentration (C). In all 15 patients, the dialysis procedures (A) - (C) were used for 2 weeks each with six sessions, the last being taken for investigation. Body fluid distribution was calculated. In patients with serum sodium above 136 mmol/l, the conventional dialysis (A) as well as the Uf profile (B) showed a net fluid shift from extracellular volume (ECV) to intracellular volume (ICV). Using the profile with hyperionic, decreasing Na+D (C), the reverse fluid shift with decreasing ICV was achieved not only in those with serum Na+ <136 mmol/l, but also in those with serum Na+ > or = 136 mmol/l. The release of vasoactive hormones decreased already at profile haemodialysis (B) compared with (A) and was further reduced in (C). These results would suggest, profile dialyses B and C to have less impact on the cardiovascular system in elderly patients assuming higher patient comfort compared with the standard dialysis procedure. A higher benefit was obtained in C compared with B, presumably due to the additional prevention of the ICV shift and plasma volume depletion in patients with initial serum sodium > or = 136 mmol/l using transiently hyperionic Na+D. These results show that in elderly patients, hyperionic profile haemodialysis (Na+D > Na+S) had less impact on cardiovascular regulation than conventional bicarbonate dialysis."

CD009647,0,19836623,0,Valproate-induced delirium in a demented patient.,"In this study we report a case of valproate-induced delirium in a patient affected with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A 75-year-old woman with AD presented moderate cognitive impairment associated to behavioral disorders, characterized by aggression, agitation, severe insomnia. She was treated with galantamine, promazine, acetylsalicylic acid and pantoprazole. Since behavioral disorders worsened more and more, home neurological consultation was asked. The neurologist prescribed a mood stabilizer, sodium valproate 500 mg daily for the first week and then, twice a day and stopped promazine. After an apparent initial benefit, about 16 days later, patient suddenly developed hyperactive delirium. It was characterized by worsening of insomnia and agitation, severe confusion, delusions, visual hallucinations alternated to sedation. She became progressively unable to walk and completely dependent in daily living activities. An urgent geriatric consultation was performed at patient's home; physical examination showed mild dehydration, normal blood pressure. Oxygen saturation and electrocardiogram were normal. Sodium valproate was immediately stopped and rehydration was performed. The patient was admitted to a Geriatric Unit, where organic and metabolic damages were excluded. During the hospital stay the patient was agitated, aggressive, confused; intramuscular haloperidol 5mg and saline intravenous infusion 1500 cc daily were performed, they were partly successful. Three days after she was discharged and continued treatment with oral haloperidol 5mg daily. One week later the patient recovered and she is at present healthy. This is a case report of valproate-induced delirium. The Naranjo scale scored 7, classifying this drug-related event as probable. The present case report suggests the need for minimizing the use of psychoactive drugs in elderly demented patients, whether possible; age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suggest the opportunity of a careful evaluation and a slow titration of treatments in these patients."

CD009647,0,3192313,0,"The effect of hemodialysis on whole blood, plasma and erythrocyte viscosity.","The effect of hemodialysis (HD) on blood viscosity has not been adequately investigated. We studied blood viscosity during HD employing coneplate viscometry. Ten patients with end-stage renal disease were studied before and immediately after HD. To dissect the possible effects of HD on plasma and red blood cell (RBC) determinants, we measured whole blood, plasma, and reconstituted erythrocyte viscosities. The latter consisted of RBC's suspended in a buffered saline solution (pH = 7.4 units). In addition, serum, electrolytes and hematocrit (HCT) were measured. The results revealed a significant rise in whole blood viscosity after dialysis. Likewise, plasma viscosity rose considerably with dialysis. However, when the RBC's were reconstituted to a constant HCT, no significant difference was noted before and after HD. As expected, body weight, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations fell while HCT and protein concentration rose with HD. A significant correlation was found between the observed rise in HCT, and dialysis-induced rise in whole blood viscosity. Likewise, the observed rises in plasma viscosity after dialysis significantly correlated with the rise in protein concentration. In addition, the change in whole blood and plasma viscosity values correlated with the degree of ultrafiltration (weight loss). In conclusion, whole blood and plasma viscosity rises with hemodialysis. The observed rise in viscosity is primarily due to hemoconcentration."

CD009647,0,10649728,0,Bioimpedance analysis of fluid compartments in female CAPD patients.,"Dry weight is difficult to determine in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Bioimpedance spectroscopy using a multi-frequency analyzer was used to measure total body water, extracellular water, and intracellular water in 7 female CAPD patients and, for comparison, in 6 normal female controls. One patient was measured a second time after a 10-kg fluid loss. Mean weight in controls and CAPD patients was similar, as was the percent of body weight that was water. However, the ratio of extracellular water to intracellular water was 0.814 in controls but 1.11 in CAPD patients, suggesting either more extracellular water and/or less intracellular water in the CAPD patients compared to the controls. When analyzed, the percent of total body water that was extracellular was significantly greater in the CAPD group. There was also a significant reduction in the percent of intracellular water that contributed to body weight in the CAPD patients. Body cell mass was 38.1% in controls but only 30.2% in CAPD patients. Serum albumin concentration ranged from 2.1 to 4.2 g/dL in CAPD and a linear relationship was present between serum albumin concentration and cell membrane capacitance. We conclude that 60% of body weight as body water may be an overestimate of volume (V) when the formula Kt/V is used to measure adequacy, and that bioimpedance spectroscopy may be a useful technique for assessing both fluid balance and body cell mass or nutritional status in CAPD patients."
CD009647,0,17703615,0,[Coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with dialysis-dependent renal failure].,"From January 1995 to May 2003, 36 patients with dialysis-dependent renal failure underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. We performed the operation with cardiopulmonary bypass (group On) in 17 cases and without cardiopulmonary bypass (group Off) in 19 patients [off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) 15, minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) 4]. There were no statistical differences regarding mean age, sex, duration of dialysis, preoperative hypertension, diabetes and peripheral and cerebral vascular diseases. Mean operation time and the number of bypass grafts were 315 +/- 53 minutes, 2.8 +/- 0.8 grafts in group On and 284 +/- 78 minutes, 2.4 +/- 1.1 grafts in group Off, respectively (not significant). Seventeen patients (100%) of group On and 12 patients (63%) needed blood transfusion. Hospital stay after operation was significantly longer in group On (40 days) of group Off than that in group Off (26 days). After the operation, continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) was used in 10 cases (59%) in group On and 3 cases (16%) in group Off. In coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on dialysis patient, it is very effective to have various operation techniques, such as off-pump bypass and on-pump beating bypass. Also control of water-electrolyte balance using early postoperative CHDF is useful. However, off-pump cases could be controlled by conventional hemodialysis."
CD009647,0,19327423,0,Effect of cholesterol crystals on plaques and intima in arteries of patients with acute coronary and cerebrovascular syndromes.,"Plaque disruption (PD) causes most acute cardiovascular events. Although cholesterol crystals (CCs) have been observed in plaques, their role in PD was unknown. However, cholesterol expands with crystallization tearing and perforating fibrous tissues. This study tested the hypothesis that CCs can damage plaques and intima, triggering PD, as observed in tissues prepared without ethanol solvents that dissolve CCs. Coronary arteries of patients who died of acute coronary syndrome (n = 19) and non-acute coronary syndrome causes (n = 12) and carotid plaques from patients with (n = 51) and without (n = 19) neurologic symptoms were studied. Samples were examined for CCs perforating the intima using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with ethanol or vacuum dehydration. In addition, fresh unfixed carotid plaques were examined at 37 degrees C using confocal microscopy. Crystal content using SEM was scored from 0 to +3. SEM using vacuum dehydration had significantly higher crystal content compared with SEM using ethanol dehydration (+2.5 +/- 0.53 vs +0.25 +/- 0.46; p <0.0003), with enhanced detection of CC perforations. The presence of CCs using SEM and confocal microscopy was similar, suggesting that CC perforation can occur in vivo at 37 degrees C. All patients with acute coronary syndrome had perforating CCs, but none was present in patients without acute coronary syndrome (p = 0.0001). For all plaques, there were strong associations of CCs with PD, thrombus, symptoms (p <0.0001), and plaque size (p <0.02). Crystal content was an independent predictor of thrombus and symptoms. In conclusion, by avoiding ethanol in tissue preparation, CCs perforating the intima were shown to be associated with PD. Crystal content was significantly associated with clinical events, suggesting that cholesterol crystallization may have a role in PD."
CD009647,0,8391608,0,Plasma cGMP level as a marker of the hydration state in renal replacement therapy.,"We investigated, whether plasma cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cGMP) may be suited as a marker of hyperhydration in hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In 81 HD patients the levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and cGMP were markedly elevated before HD (ANP: 165 +/- 11.1 pg/ml; cGMP 43.5 +/- 2.2 pmol/ml). Significantly lower values (P < 0.01) were found after HD (ANP: 97 +/- 8.4 pmol/ml; cGMP 19.5 +/- 1.5 pmol/ml). Twenty-three patients had cGMP levels above 20 pmol/ml after HD. Therefore ""dry body weight"" was reduced in these patients. This resulted in a ""normalization"" of cGMP values to a postdialytic range below 20 pmol/ml in the majority of patients. All seven patients with persistently high cGMP levels despite weight reduction had left sided heart failure. In 33 CAPD patients ANP was slightly lower than after HD (68 +/- 10.4 pg/ml), and the cGMP level (22.4 +/- 2.3 pmol/ml) was between pre- and postdialytic values in HD. In eight CAPD patients with clinical signs of hypervolemia plasma cGMP, but not ANP, was significantly elevated. We conclude that the plasma cGMP level appears to be a reliable marker for fluid overload in patients on renal replacement therapy with normal heart function."
CD009647,0,6351558,0,Treatable dementias.,"Dementia, a syndrome of acquired intellectual deterioration, is an etiologically nonspecific condition that can be permanent or reversible. When evaluating demented patients, a careful exposure history will determine the possible role of drugs, metals, or toxins. Physical examination may reveal focal deficits in cases of intracranial mass lesions and spasticity or ataxia of the lower limbs if hydrocephalus is present. Coexistence of dementia and a peripheral neuropathy usually indicates the existence of a toxic or metabolic disorder. Depressed mood, sleep disturbance, anorexia, impotence, constipation, and psychomotor retardation indicate the presence of a depressive syndrome. Asterixis, myoclonus, and postural tremor are common in toxic-metabolic dementias, whereas resting tremor, choreoathetosis, or rigidity occur in progressive extrapyramidal disorder. EEG is focally abnormal in cases of cerebral mass lesions and shows generalized slowing in toxic-metabolic encephalopathies. CT will aid in the identification of hydrocephalus, subdural hematomas, and intracranial mass lesions. A thorough laboratory evaluation including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and blood sugar, liver and thyroid function tests, serum calcium and phosphorus levels, B12 and folate levels, serum copper and ceruloplasmin, VDRL, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and lumbar puncture may demonstrate treatable disorders that are adversely affecting intellectual function. Elderly individuals are particularly susceptible to the effects of toxic or metabolic disorders, and a mild dementia may be exaggerated by relatively minor fluctuations in metabolic status. Treatable causes of dementia should be sought in all demented patients."

CD009647,0,20116320,0,Cardiothoracic ratio in postmortem chest radiography with regard to the cause of death.,"It is difficult to examine the intact in situ status of thoracic organs, including the heart and lungs, after opening the chest at autopsy. The present study investigated the pathological diagnostic significance of the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) with regard to heart and lung weight in postmortem plain chest radiography. The pathological diagnostic significance of the CTR in postmortem plain chest radiography using serial forensic autopsy cases of adults (>19 years of age, n=367, within 72 h postmortem) was retrospectively investigated. In natural deaths, CTR was larger for heart diseases, and was smaller for pulmonary infection and gastrointestinal bleeding, showing correlations to the heart weight except in cases of hemopericardium. In traumatic deaths, CTR was larger in cases of fire fatality and acute methamphetamine intoxication, and varied in cases of blunt injury, showing correlations to the heart weight. However, CTR was smaller for sharp instrument injury and drowning, independently of the heart weight. These findings suggest that postmortem CTR (median, 55.6%, measured using a mobile X-ray apparatus) primarily depends on the heart weight, but is substantially modified during the process of death: the CTR may be enlarged by cardiac dilatation due to terminal congestive heart failure, but may be reduced by inflated lungs in drowning or hypovolemia due to fatal hemorrhage. CTR showed a mild correlation to the right diaphragm level, which was also related to the cause of death, but was independent of the left diaphragm level. Plain chest radiographic findings may also be helpful in investigating the pathophysiology of death, and are to some extent comparable with clinical findings. This also suggests the potential usefulness of postmortem CT and MRI for analysis of terminal cardiac function."

CD009647,0,1687048,0,Bioelectrical impedance analysis of nutritional status in uremic patients on regular hemodialysis.,"The body composition of uremic patients on regular hemodialysis (HD) therapy was studied using the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) technique. The accuracy of BIA in estimating fluid loss during HD was also studied. Thirty-five uremic patients (28 men and 7 women), regularly treated by hemodialysis (HD), were enrolled. The uremic patients had lower serum albumin levels and a marginally lower arm muscle circumference (AMC; p = 0.06) than 107 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects (86 men and 21 women). Before HD, the uremic patients presented with a similar percentage of body fat (BF), fat-free mass (FFM) and total body water (TBW) as normal controls, but they possessed a lower percentage of TBW and FFM, and a higher percentage of BF after HD. When BIA was applied to estimate the fluid loss during HD, overestimation usually occurred. A good correlation between the body fluid loss estimated by the BIA method (BIAL) and that estimated by the body weighing method (BWL) was noted. An equation of BWL = 0.452 BIAL + 0.844 (n = 35, R = 0.85, SEE = 0.58, p less than 0.0001) was derived following linear regression analysis. The weight of BF estimated by BIA before and after HD demonstrated a good correlation (n = 35, R = 0.98, p less than 0.0001). In conclusion, uremic patients on regular HD therapy seem to have decreased serum albumin levels and decreased AMC in anthropometry. After HD, they possess a lower percentage of FFM and TBW than normal controls. The results suggest that accelerated protein catabolism is a common problem in uremic patients on regular HD therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,2221464,0,Effect of high-dose furosemide in refractory congestive heart failure.,"High-dose firosemide is considered effective in primary renal sodium retention but is not generally recommended in congestive heart failure. In order to evaluate efficacy and safety of high-dose furosemide (greater than 500 mg/day), the authors studied 20 patients (pts) resistant to therapy (including furosemide less than 500 mg/day) selected from 161 pts admitted for chronic heart failure. All refractory pts (15 men and 5 women, mean age sixty +/- 12 years) were in NYHA class IV and showed hyponatremia (130 +/- 5 mEq/L) and impaired renal function (BUN 31 +/- 14 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.3 +/- 0.3 mg/dL and BUN/creatinine ratio 23 +/- 7). In addition to digitalis, dopamine, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or vasodilators, IV high-dose furosemide (775 +/- 419 mg/day, 500-2000) was given for ten +/- five days under daily clinical and laboratory monitoring. Three pts died of low-output syndrome while 16 pts were upgraded to NYHA class III and 1 pt to class II; a mean weight reduction of 7.3 +/- 2.9 kg in ten + five days (0.80 +/- 0.4 kg/day) and a mean diuresis increase of 88 +/- 57% occurred. The maximal dose of furosemide did not correlate with serum creatinine but did correlate with BUN/creatinine ratio (r = 0.78, p less than .001). Pts were discharged on with chronic heart failure, and 43% in the subgroup in NYHA class IV with hyponatremia. High dose furosemide was effective for rapid removal of excess water and salt in ""furosemide-resistant"" congestive heart failure. The relationship between renal impairment and maximal furosemide doses seems to confirm the role of renal pharmacokinetics in the appearance of furosemide resistance."
CD009647,0,9058444,0,Response of severely malnourished patients to preoperative parenteral nutrition: a randomized clinical trial of water and sodium restriction.,"Preoperative parenteral nutrition (PPN) may be beneficial for severely malnourished patients who are candidates for a major elective surgical procedure. The response to PPN, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. Expansion of the extracellular water compartment may occur in some patients, producing a further decrease in the serum albumin concentration and increasing the postoperative complications. Our aims were to investigate the occurrence of and factors associated with water and sodium retention during PPN and its impact on postoperative respiratory complications. Forty-one patients with gastrointestinal cancer and severe malnutrition (weight loss > 15% and/or serum albumin < 35 g/L) were randomly allocated to two groups receiving isocaloric isonitrogenous PPN for 10 d. The Standard PPN Group (SG, n = 19) received 70% of nonprotein calories as glucose, 45 cc of water.kg-1.d-1, and 140 mEq/d of sodium chloride; and the Modified Group (MG, n = 22) received 70% of calories as fat, 30 cc of water.kg-1.d-1, and no sodium. Weight and albumin changes, diuresis, sodium and water balances, and postoperative complications were recorded. At the end of PPN, the SG showed a higher weight gain (0.8 versus -1.5 kg, P = 0.0001) and albumin decrease (-0.7 versus 2.3 g/L, P = 0.006). Diuresis and sodium balance were greater in the SG (1,230 versus 959 mL/d, P = 0.003 and 40 versus -27 mEq/d, P = 0.001). Weight changes correlated with water (r2 = 0.46, P = 0.001) and sodium (r2 = 0.62, P = 0.0001) balances. Inappropriate responses to PPN in both groups (expansion or depletion of the extracellular water compartment) were associated with a significant increase in pulmonary postoperative complications. During PPN, extracellular water expansion--as determined by increasing weight and lowering of the serum albumin concentration--and aggressive fluid therapy to treat water and sodium depletion seem crucial to the development of postoperative respiratory complications."

CD009647,0,4017265,0,Arguments for the presence of a Na-K ATPase pump inhibitor in the plasma of uremic and essential hypertensive patients.,"The effect of salt and/or volume depletion has been tested in 6 end-stage renal disease and 11 essential hypertensive patients (HTA) on red blood cell (RBC) ionic fluxes. Volume depletion promotes an increase in the RBC Na-K ATPase activity with, as a result, a significant decrease in intracellular sodium concentration [Na)ic). Moreover, a factor has been found in the plasma of uremic subjects which causes natriuresis when injected in rat renal arteries. The concentration of this factor decreases during dialysis in relation to the weight loss and the increase in the RBC Na-K pump activity. In essential hypertension, the effect of a low salt diet on the blood pressure is correlated with the improvement of RBC Na-K ATPase activity. These experiments illustrate the presence of a Na-K ATPase inhibitor in the plasma of these subjects, dependent on sodium and water balance."

A prospective study has been carried out, and 68 patients with hypercholesterolaemia have been investigated to study the effects of central cooling on serum lipid levels. 2. Central cooling was obtained by the exposure of the whole body to cold water. All patients were trained to gradually reduce the water temperature from 22 to 14 degrees C and to increase the time of exposure from 5 to 20 min over a period of 90 days. The 33 male and 35 female patients were aged between 40 and 60 years at entry with total cholesterol of 6.0 mmol/l or greater and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol of 4. 0 mmol/l or greater. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine (FT4), total T3, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triacylglycerols and total fat mass (determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan) were obtained at baseline and after 3 months treatment with hydrotherapy. 3. Central cooling obtained by hydrotherapy results in a median fall in tympanic temperature from 0.2 degrees C (P<0.001) to 0.8 degrees C (P<0.001). We have observed in these patients a significant reduction in total cholesterol (-0.2 mmol/l, P=0.006) and LDL-cholesterol (-0.2 mmol/l, P=0.004). Serum FT4 level was higher than baseline results in 30 of these hypercholesterolaemic patients (15.5 pmol/l to 17.3 pmol/l) and there was no significant change in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and total T3. 4. In conclusion, in our patients with hypercholesterolaemia we have observed a significant reduction of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol after body temperature regulation."

In forearm skin, irritant dermatitis developed in most subjects, as indicated by a VS and TEWL increase, with the reaction in premenopausal women significantly more intense than in postmenopausal women. In vulvar skin, however, irritant reactions were not observed. CAP increased significantly in the forearm of premenopausal but not postmenopausal women, whereas it decreased significantly in postmenopausal vulvar skin. Thus, vulvar skin was less reactive to SLS at low concentrations than was forearm skin. However, SLS did affect vulvar skin stratum corneum hydration. The irritant response in the forearm decreased with age for all parameters studied, whereas in vulvar skin age-related differences in irritant reaction were limited to stratum corneum hydration."
CD009647,0,21867622,0,[Clinicopathological features of acute tumor lysis syndrome in elderly patients with malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma].,"This study was purposed to investigate the clinicopathological features of acute tumor lysis syndrome (ATLS) in elderly patients with malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, so as to explore its diagnosis and treatments. 2 cases of ATLS in elderly patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were retrospectively analyzed, including progress of tumor, the level of laboratory examination, clinical manifestation and response to treatments. Data regarding clinical and biochemical parameters were collected. The results indicated that the 2 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were found to have high tumor burden, and were sensitive to anti-tumor treatments, and had many promoting factors of ATLS. 1 patient displayed hyperkalemia, but another displayed hypokalemia. Both patients were given allopurinol, hydration and alkalization, and one was given dialysis. But both died because of disease deterioration. ATLS rarely occurred in patients who were treated by rituximab only. But the patients with high grade NHL and high tumor burden maybe develop ATLS during 1 - 4 days after given rituximab. In conclusion, ATLS is one of factors of death in patients with malignant lymphoma. The clinical manifestation is not typical, and the diagnosis mainly depends on laboratory examination parameters. Earlier judgment, prophylaxis and effective treatment are important for improving prognosis of elderly DLBCL-NHL."

CD009647,0,16089274,0,Nutritional strategies of mountain marathon competitors--an observational study.,"Mountain marathons are 2-d, self-supported adventure races, during which competitors must carry all nutritional requirements to sustain athletic effort. This requires a compromise between the energy required to perform and the weight penalty of carrying it. We have undertaken a nutritional survey of event competitors in the UK using a questionnaire-based approach and have monitored dehydration during the event. We found that competitors in longer-distance classes (> 50 km) carry significantly less mass of food, which is more energy dense, but that the calorific value is lower than that of competitors in shorter classes. Carbohydrate and protein consumption both positively associated with performance. Competitors became progressively dehydrated throughout the event. Counterintuitively, the better-performing subjects became the most dehydrated. Competitors at all distances should make more effort to rehydrate during breaks in the event. Competitors at shorter distances could choose more energy-dense foods to reduce weight penalty."
CD009647,0,11334196,0,Albumin in the pump prime: its effect on postoperative weight gain.,"An investigation was conducted to determine whether adding albumin to the prime of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit had any effect on postoperative weight gain. Patients undergoing non-emergency myocardial revascularization for coronary artery disease were divided into two groups. Group I (albumin) received 250 ml of 5% human albumin in their pump prime, whereas group II (control) served as controls. The same surgeon, anesthesia technique, perfusion circuit and conduct, and postoperative management were employed for all patients in the study. No statistically significant differences could be found between the groups for any of the variables studied, including fluid intake during surgery and the first 24 h postoperation, urine output, fluid balance and postoperative weight gain. The authors conclude from this investigation that adding 250 ml of 5% human albumin to the pump prime has no effect on postoperative weight gain. The next step could be to examine the effect of using larger amounts of albumin or plasma volume expanders in the pump prime."

CD009647,0,10348361,0,Metabolic indicators of hydration status in the prediction of parotid salivary-gland function.,"Salivary glands require body fluids for normal function. It has been suggested that decreased levels of hydration (dehydration) may cause diminished salivary output, but it is not known whether salivary flow rates are related to biological measures of hydration status. The purpose of this study was to determine whether reduced parotid salivary flow rates, as a result of dehydration, can be assessed through physiological markers of hydration status. Twenty-four healthy and unmedicated adults abstained from eating and drinking for 24 h and then underwent intravenous rehydration to replace all lost weight. Unstimulated (UPFR) and 2% citric acid-stimulated (SPFR) parotid flow rates, body weight, and markers of hydration status (haematocrit, haemoglobin, serum sodium, plasma protein, creatinine, serum and urine osmolality) were assessed at baseline, at the completion of the 24-h dehydration period, and 1 h after rehydration had been completed. Correlation coefficients (r) and coefficients of determination (r2) were obtained between: (a) UPFR and each metabolic variable at each time point, (b) the change in UPFR and the corresponding change in each metabolic variable due to dehydration and rehydration, and (c) the percentage change in UPFR and the corresponding percentage change of each metabolic variable due to dehydration and rehydration. These tests were then repeated for SPFR. There were several isolated significant correlations but no consistent trends between salivary flow rates and metabolic markers of hydration status. These findings suggest that metabolic indicators of hydration status are not accurate predictors of parotid salivary flow rates."

Low-protein diet and individual drug therapy were unchanged throughout the study. All patients received a single oral dose of 240 mg of muzolimine for 4 or 6 consecutive days depending on individual response. Clinical status, diuresis, body weight, blood and urine chemistry were recorded daily. In 19 out of 21 patients muzolimine treatment induced reversal of edema and congestive heart failure and a satisfactory fluid balance was achieved. Only two patients did not respond to diuretic treatment and required dialysis to control fluid balance and azotemia. In responsive patients diuresis increased by 50-100% and no rebound antidiuresis was observed after drug withdrawal. Body weight decreased meanly by 9%. No significant change occurred in serum concentration of K throughout the study, even in the 11 patients on digoxin. Except for a slight decrease of serum Cl by the end of treatment, no significant change in serum electrolytes was recorded. No effect was observed on blood glucose, urea and creatinine clearance whereas a slight increase of serum uric acid was recorded. Urinary lysozyme and gamma-GT were similar before and after the trial. Apart from a single case of muscle cramps, no significant side-effects were recorded. In conclusion, the present results indicate that short-term, high-dose oral muzolimine treatment is effective and safe in most patients with advanced CRF and acute fluid retention."

CD009647,0,15351800,0,SIADH closely associated with non-functioning pituitary adenoma.,"We demonstrated severe hyponatremia in a 68 year-old man who had pituitary tumor. He had poor appetite and was disoriented. Tests revealed hyponatremia of 110 mmol/l, and he was admitted to Jichi Medical School Omiya Medical Center to undergo further tests. Physical findings revealed disturbance of consciousness with Japan Coma Scale I-2. There was neither dehydration nor edema. Laboratory data showed a serum sodium level of 112 mmol/l; plasma osmolality, 219 mmol/kg; and urinary osmolality, 555 mmol/kg. Plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) level was 1.6 pmol/l despite the marked hypoosmolality. Anterior pituitary function was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a pituitary tumor of 20 x 18 x 20 mm in size, which pushed the pituitary stalk upward. After the adenomectomy, serum sodium level was kept normal without any treatment. Histology showed basophilic adenoma. These findings indicate that local pituitary tumor may cause exaggerated secretion of AVP, resulting in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)."

CD009647,0,8186777,0,Renal function after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy to a solitary kidney.,"Studying renal function in patients with a solitary kidney undergoing SWL eliminates the compensatory effects of an untreated contralateral kidney and thus indicates any loss of function in the treated kidney. In 17 patients with a preoperative serum creatinine clearance of 1.5 mg/dl or less who underwent SWL to a solitary kidney, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated by the formula of Cockcroft and Gault, which correlates significantly with measured creatinine clearance. A change of > or = 20% in the GFR was considered a clinically significant deterioration of renal function. In 12 patients with < 24 months' follow-up (mean 7.3 months) after SWL, there was no change in the estimated GFR, whereas 5 patients with > 24 months' follow-up (mean 36 months) had an average 22% reduction in the estimated GFR. This long-term effect is similar to the 29% long-term reduction in renal function recorded after percutaneous nephrolithotomy in solitary kidneys. Multiple stones, higher numbers of shock waves, and repeated SWL sessions correlated with decreases in GFR, but none of the differences was statistically significant. Like percutaneous nephrolithotomy, SWL results in a clinically significant long-term reduction in renal function."
CD009647,0,19891597,0,New perspectives for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Currently its clinical assessment is based on the exclusion of other forms of dementia and a definitive diagnosis requires a confirmation by examination of post-mortem brains. Therefore, there is a strong need to find easy measurable AD biomarkers that could facilitate the early diagnosis and monitoring the efficacy of the few therapies currently available. This would favor the development of further therapeutic approaches. Recently, dozens of biomarkers altered in peripheral tissues and body fluids have been patented by a variety of approaches, including transcriptomics, proteomics and peptidomics. However, assays for the routine laboratory diagnosis of AD are not available yet. The validation of these biomarkers is hindered by the fact that patient classification relies on clinical diagnosis that is not always accurate and this problem obstacles the enrollment of well characterized large patient cohorts needed for confirmation. This review provides an update of the status of research on AD peripheral biomarkers in the current post-genomic era, including recent patents in the field."

CD009647,0,3756934,0,Pharmacokinetics of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) after administration in hypertonic saline.,"Nephrotoxicity, the dose-limiting toxicity of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP), is ameliorated when administered in hypertonic saline with normal saline hydration. To determine whether the diminished nephrotoxicity is associated with alteration of the pharmacokinetics of CDDP, we examined the pharmacokinetics of free and total platinum, platinum renal excretion, and urine electrolytes in patients given CDDP in hypertonic saline and in patients given CDDP in a conventional manner. The pharmacokinetics of free and total platinum for equal doses of CDDP were similar regardless of the vehicle of administration and the method of hydration. CDDP given in a vehicle of high chloride concentration with normal saline hydration resulted in a statistically significant increase in both urine volume and chloruresis compared to the conventional regimen. The decreased nephrotoxicity associated with administration of CDDP in hypertonic saline with saline diuresis may be related to increased chloruresis, urinary volume, or a combination of both, but did not appear to be related to an alteration in the pharmacokinetics."

Perioperative disorders of thermoregulation are strongly expressed in the group of patients, and the number of complications rises significantly during inadvertent perioperative hypothermia. The aim of this study was estimation of body temperature in patients subjected to thoracosurgical operations. The study was performed in 23 patients older than 65 years, which were divided into 2 groups. In the group I (12 persons) we used usual methods of heat loss prevention. In group II there were used: passive methods of protection against heat loss as well as Hotline blood and fluids warmer with the possibility of intravenous fluids warming. The body temperature was estimated every 30 minutes. The temperature detectors were located on plantar surface of hallux and in nasopharynx. We observed statistically significant decrease in body temperature values in group I. We conclude that there is the necessarity of the using of accessory methods of heat loss prevention in elder patients subjected to thoracosurgery."
CD009647,0,3922212,0,Compensatory enteral hyperalimentation for management of patients with severe short bowel syndrome.,"In order to evaluate the effects of an unrestricted, compensatory, enteral hyperalimentation in patients with short bowel syndrome, we retrospectively selected from 128 consecutive patients with extensive small bowel resection a group of 25 who developed under this regimen a massive protracted diarrhea (fecal weight 2005-6188 g/day). All the patients but one were weaned from parenteral nutrition by the eighth day after admission. Although fecal weight increased in relation to the increase of the enteral intake, there was a significant gain of body weight, serum-albumin, and creatinine-height index and an improved fluid and electrolyte balance through the period of hospitalization. By contrast, 18 of the 25 patients developed hypocalcemia and/or hypomagnesemia. After discharge (median follow-up, three years), most patients resumed normal social activity. It is concluded that exclusively enteral hyperalimentation can stabilize most patients with severe short bowel syndrome even in the case of massive fecal losses."
CD009647,0,11676229,0,Risk factors for development of postoperative hypertension.,"One hundred and eighty-nine patients who underwent digestive tract surgery were studied to investigate risk factors for the development of postoperative hypertension.

Data collected included blood pressure, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), medical history, total water balance and grade of surgical stress. Maximum postoperative systolic blood pressure and incidence of postoperative hypertensive urgency were the dependent variables. Mean preoperative systolic blood pressure, age and BMI were significantly related to maximum postoperative systolic blood pressure and postoperative hypertensive urgency. In addition, the grade of surgical stress was significantly related to maximum postoperative systolic blood pressure. In analyses of multiple variables, the adjusted odds ratio for postoperative hypertensive urgency was 1.16 for every 1 mmHg increase in mean preoperative systolic blood pressure, 1.05 for every 1 year increase in age and 0.82 for every 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI.

Urine flow, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) and excretion of electrolytes and osmoles were measured for three periods of 20 minutes during infusion of ANP, in the morning of the day after surgery. Haemodynamic studies were conducted, and serum levels of ANP, catecholamines and plasma renin activity were measured. ANP levels increased from 52 to approximately 250 pMol.L-1 during ANP infusion and decreased after infusion to a level equal to baseline. GFR increased from 92 mL.min-1 by 58, 20 and 21%, respectively. RPF was unchanged. Urine flow rate increased from 1.99 mL.min-1 by 81, 151 and 173%, respectively. Fractional clearances of sodium, chloride and osmoles were increased during the second and third ANP periods whereas fractional potassium clearance did not change during the study. There were no changes in catecholamine levels or plasma renin activity during the study. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and calculated systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance did not change whereas reductions occurred in cardiac index, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and mean right atrial pressure. We conclude that infusion of ANP also in the postoperative situation increases GFR, diuresis and sodium excretion."

At the end of treatment, and one month later, there was no evidence of either complete or partial response. The treatment produced fever, anorexia and weight loss, with transient leucopenia and thrombocytopenia; there was evidence of a non-cholestatic elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase, with clinical deterioration in the condition of three patients presenting with hyponatraemia. A transient hypocalcaemia during high dose therapy was also noted.

A 66-year-old woman who nearly drowned in a vat of vegetable oil was admitted as an emergency case with severe hypoxia after rescue. Chest computed tomography (CT) findings showed bilateral ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and the case fulfilled the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage performed on admission indicated oil droplets and marked neutrophilia (67%), which made us diagnose ARDS induced by lipoid pneumonia. We commenced treatment with pulsed steroids and strictly managed fluid balance under mechanical ventilation. Despite immediate improvement in oxygenation, the value of extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) measured by the PiCCO system consistently remained over 30 ml/Kg through her clinical course.

CD009647,0,7843705,0,Whole-body and segmental bioelectrical parameters in chronic liver disease: effect of gender and disease stages.,"The aim of this study was to examine and compare whole-body and segmental impedance measurements in control subjects and patients with progression of liver disease and to investigate whole-body and segmental bioelectrical changes occurring during dehydration therapy or paracentesis. Males have lower resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) values than females in measurements both of the whole body and of the arm, leg, and trunk. This is not true in patients. In the three groups of patients, whole-body R and Xc were lower in each increased disease stage, suggesting that stage has a significant main effect on impedance measurements. The lower extremities were the segment most influenced by the progression of liver disease. The sum of the arm and leg R was only slightly lower than the value of whole-body resistance. The trunk has a meager influence on this parameter, as is clearly shown by the absence of variations before and immediately after paracentesis. In edematous cirrhotic patients without ascites treated with diuretics, our data also showed a significant correlation (r = .81; SEE = 1.2) between changes in body weight (BW) and in the bioelectrical evaluation of total body water (TBW). The association of a prevalent increment of Xc (approximately 40%) with a reduction of extracellular water is the most significant bioelectrical event during dehydration therapy. All these findings show that impedance measurements have a low sensitivity in detecting the volume of ascites in cirrhotic patients, whereas Xc has a clinical use in monitoring changes in extracellular water (EW)."

Sixty patients (mean age 80 years) were randomly allocated to treatment with 1 tablet daily of either 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide/2.5 mg amiloride or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide/50 mg triamterene. The dose was increased to 2 tablets daily if necessary, after 2 weeks, for a further 6 weeks. Patients' response to treatment was assessed at 2, 4 and 8 weeks using a simple clinical scoring system for signs and symptoms of their condition, and routine biochemical analysis was carried out at baseline and the end of treatment. One patient was withdrawn from the study due to a rash which was probably related to hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride treatment. A further 11 patients were excluded from the analysis because of intercurrent illness or inadequate records. Analysis of the results from 48 patients showed that both treatments resulted in an improvement in clinical score and weight reduction, with more than three-quarters of the patients responding to treatment. No serious biochemical disturbances occurred; in particular, no new cases of hyponatraemia (serum sodium less than 130 mmol/l) developed. Both preparations, therefore, were effective and tolerated forms of treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure in the elderly and there were no significant differences between them."
CD009647,0,8865881,0,Similarities in functional state of the kidney in patients treated with CAPD and hemodialysis.,"Differences have been reported in the decline of residual renal function in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD), but it is unknown whether the urinary handling of water and solutes is similar in these patient groups. Ten CAPD patients with residual renal function were investigated during a clearance period (CP) of 24 hours, and 11 HD patients were investigated during one interdialytic interval of three days. In CAPD patients the urinary volume excretion was 0.65 +/- 0.31 mL/min (mean +/- SD), and the inulin clearance was 3.85 +/- 2.82 mL/min. A negative correlation was found between the peritoneal net ultrafiltration rate and both the urinary volume excretion rate (r = -0.80, p < 0.01) and the fractional sodium clearance (r = -0.69, p < 0.05). In HD patients the urinary volume excretion increased from 0.36 +/- 0.36 mL/min during the initial eight hours of CP (HD-A) to 0.64 +/- 0.29 mL/min during the last ten hours of CP (HD-D, p < 0.05), and the inulin clearance increased from 1.9 +/- 1.3 (HD-A) to 2.9 +/- 1.1 (HD-D, p < 0.005). The fractional sodium clearance increased from 8.5 +/- 5.7% (HD-A) to 14.4 +/- 9.0% (HD-D, p < 0.05). It can be concluded that the fractional excretion of volume and fractional clearance of solutes were similar in patients treated with CAPD and hemodialysis. The most important regulating factor seems to be the volume status influenced by volume removal by peritoneal net ultrafiltration in CAPD patients, and volume expansion during the interdialytic interval in hemodialysis patients."
CD009647,0,7620239,0,Comparison of the effect of inhaled selective and non-selective adrenergic agonists on cardiorespiratory parameters in chronic stable asthma.,"Increased hypoxia has been found after beta 2 adrenoceptor agonists (but not adrenaline) in asthmatics. Combined with hypokalaemia and sympathomimetic stimulation, this may predispose to cardiac arrhythmias. We have compared the effects of nebulized adrenaline and a selective beta 2 agonist (salbutamol) on the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), minute ventilation (VE), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), plasma potassium and the electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with chronic stable asthma. Six patients were studied according to a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over protocol. Adrenaline (5 mg), salbutamol (5 mg) and placebo were administered during 4 min tidal breathing using a nebulizer driven by air. There was a fall in SaO2 after both adrenaline (mean % fall (SEM) 3.3 (0.2)) and salbutamol (4.0 (0.7)) associated with an increase in FEV1, with no change in VE. Therefore, the fall in SaO2 must have been caused by increased ventilation-perfusion imbalance. There was an increased heart rate after both adrenaline and salbutamol and ventricular ectopic beats and a short run of parasystole were recorded on the ECG in one patient after adrenaline and in two patients after salbutamol. No change was found in plasma potassium levels. We conclude that both adrenaline and a selective beta 2 agonist salbutamol can cause a fall in SaO2 and ventricular ectopy in some asthmatic patients."

CD009647,0,17063070,0,Diagnosis of Anderson-Fabry's disease in over seventy-year-old women: description of two cases.,"Anderson-Fabry's disease (AFD) is a rare inborn X-linked sphingolipid storage disorder. Deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-GAL-A) leads to progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids within most visceral tissues and body fluids of affected patients, provoking a clinical syndrome that includes nervous system, renal, cardiac, ophthalmologic and cutaneous manifestations. Also heterozygous women, who had been considered as healthy carriers until recently, often demonstrate clinical signs of multi-organ involvement. In older women these manifestations are frequently attributed to other more common conditions of older age, and a genetic disorder is rarely hypothesized. We report the cases of two elderly women, who had been diagnosed with AFD at the ages of 70 and 74. Although it is a rare disease, AFD should be considered as a diagnostic hypothesis in women with a clinical history of cardiomyopathy and vascular encephalopathy, appearing at ages 40-50 without identification of major vascular risk factors."
CD009647,0,16584385,0,Intravenous hydration with a 2.5% glucose solution in Type II diabetes.,"Physicians are often unclear about how fast intravenous glucose solutions should be administered to adequately hydrate patients with Type II diabetes while avoiding hyperglycaemia and excessive plasma volume expansion. The aim of the present study was to analyse the disposition of a 2.5% glucose solution and create a nomogram which could serve as a guide to fluid therapy in these patients. Twelve males (mean body mass index, 29 kg/m(2)) with Type II diabetes due to insulin resistance, as quantified by an euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp, received an infusion of iso-osmotic 2.5% glucose solution with electrolytes (70 mmol/l sodium, 45 mmol/l chloride and 25 mmol/l acetate) at individual rates over 30 and 60 min respectively. Blood glucose and haemoglobin levels were measured repeatedly over 3.5 h to estimate the kinetics of glucose and fluid volume. Mean insulin sensitivity was 4.2x10(-4) dlxkg(-1)xmin(-1)x(micro-units/ml)(-1). The individualized infusion rates reached the predetermined blood glucose level of 12 mmol/l with a mean difference of 0.2 mmol/l. The disposition of glucose was an important factor governing fluid distribution. The volume of distribution of exogenous glucose averaged 19.8 litres, but for the fluid volume it was only 3.7 litres. The clearance was 0.37 litre/min for glucose and 0.10 litre/min for the fluid volume, and the results of the 30-min and 60-min infusions agreed reasonably well. It is concluded that kinetic analysis can be used to guide the infusion time and infusion rate of 2.5% glucose to reach any predetermined glucose level and volume expansion."

CD009647,0,12914563,0,Relationship between exercise performance and water distribution measured by new bioelectrical impedance analysis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Body composition analysis is useful for objective evaluation of malnutrition in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of body composition on exercise performance by patients with COPD using a new method of bioelectrical impedance analysis. Twenty patients with COPD performed incremental exercise ramp tests to the symptom-limited maximum and constant work rate tests for 10 min. Their body compositions were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis with eight electrodes and four frequencies, which could estimate the amount of intra- and extracellular water (ICW, ECW) and water distribution of the extremities separately. Some pulmonary function parameters of airflow limitation or hyperinflation and body composition parameters were significantly correlated with peakVO2. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that independent predictors of peakVO2 included ECW/ICW ratio, lower extremity water and FEV1.0 (P<0.0001, R = 0.892), which explained 27, 31 and 21% of peakVO2, respectively. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between ECW/ICW ratio and time constant of oxygen consumption in constant work rate tests. These findings indicate that increased ECW/ICW ratio and lower extremity water correlated with exercise intolerance independent of pulmonary function, and that changes in cellular hydration state might affect oxygen utilization of skeletal muscle in patients with COPD. In conclusion, the BIA used in our study, which can easily and simultaneously evaluate the water distribution of the extremities and cellular hydration state, is useful for the evaluation of exercise performance in COPD patients."
CD009647,0,22289562,0,"The relationship between bioimpedance analysis, haemodynamic parameters of haemodialysis, biochemical parameters and dry weight.","Adequate fluid management plays an important role in the treatment of haemodialysis patients and the assessment of dry weight is important for efficient therapy. Fluid volume parameters were assessed in adults undergoing haemodialysis for end-stage renal disease, using whole-body multifrequency bioimpedance analysis (BIA), and their relationship to haemodynamic and biochemical parameters of haemodialysis was evaluated. Ultrafiltration volume was correlated with age, sodium, haemoglobin, extracellular water (ECW)/total body water (TBW) ratio and ECW/intracellular water (ICW) ratio. The ECW/TBW ratio was correlated with age, body mass index, dry weight, predialysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and ECW/total body weight ratio. The ECW/ICW ratio correlated with age, dry weight, TBW, albumin, adequacy of dialysis and urea removal ratio. The study demonstrated a close relationship between bioimpedance-derived fluid volume parameters and the haemodynamic and biochemical parameters of haemodialysis. It is concluded that multifrequency whole-body BIA may have clinical value in the estimation of dry weight and other haemodynamic parameters of haemodialysis and so may protect patients from the risks associated with under- or over-hydration."
CD009647,0,3631659,0,[Peritoneal dialysis in the treatment of the low cardiac output after extracorporeal circulation].,"Low cardiac output after cardiopulmonary bypass is not uncommon. This per- and postoperative cardiac depression is accompanied by an impairment of renal function, which recovers with the improvement of the low cardiac output. These two correlated failures may become resistant to cardiotonic and diuretic drugs. Indeed the fluid balance is strongly disturbed, although venous pressure is only moderately increased. The only possible treatment could be water withdrawal. Nine patients are reported, all suffering from cardiac and renal failure after cardiopulmonary bypass. They were successfully treated with the method of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. This method allowed us to stop all intravenous cardiac drugs within 36 h, whilst diuresis reappeared together with a better efficacy of diuretic drugs. This beneficial haemodynamic effect of water withdrawal is discussed. This phenomenon may be related to an influence of right ventricular filling on the left ventricle. Low cardiac output may occur as a result of septal displacement, especially if there is concomitant myocardial suffering. Withdrawing a small volume of water may have modified the septal displacement, and improved cardiac output. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was simple and well tolerated; it seemed to have contributed to the haemodynamic recovery of all the nine patients."
CD009647,0,16868716,0,Transtubular potassium concentration gradient: comparison between healthy old people and chronic renal failure patients.,"Transtubular potassium concentration gradient (TTKG) is an index of potassium secretory activity in the distal tubule. Since water reabsorption takes place in the distal tubule as well, urine potassium concentration is a less accurate index evaluating distal K+ secretion because the effect of water is not taken into account on urine potassium concentrations. Potassium secretion and water reabsorption are strongly related to age and renal function. As a consequence, TTKG would be altered in both elderly individuals, as well as in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). The aim of this study was to assess and compare TTKG in these two groups."
CD009647,0,2249488,0,Approaches to the patient with aspiration and swallowing disabilities.,"Aspiration, or soiling of the tracheobronchial tree, can produce life-threatening pulmonary disease. Intermittent or persistent aspiration may cause symptoms including cough, intermittent fever, recurrent tracheobronchitis, atelectasis, pneumonia, and/or empyema. The pulmonary disease may be associated with weight loss, cachexia, and dehydration. In many cases the aspiration is caused by laryngeal dysfunction, allowing pulmonary contamination by swallowed material. In other cases the aspiration is caused by a dysfunction of the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phases of swallowing. In some cases the aspiration is caused by a combination of laryngeal and swallowing dysfunction. Geriatric patients are more likely to experience aspiration, since muscle weakness causing mechanical disability and neurologic impairment are more common in this age group. Therefore, with the ever-increasing aging of our population, these disabilities will be on the rise, with an associated increase in pulmonary disease and death. The approach to evaluation and management of these disorders must be based on an understanding of the underlying functional impairment."

Patients were divided, on the basis of clinical and radiographic information, into three groups: group A (11 patients), with clinically normal TF status; group B (12 patients), with elevated TF status; and group C (3 patients), with decreased TF status. The mean Z values measured in each group were: 26.5 ohms in group A, 21.8 ohms in group B, and 37.4 ohms in group C (differences significant at P less than .02). Using a cutoff Z value of 24.0 ohms would have predicted group B individuals with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 79%. In eleven patients, impedance measurement would have added information that confirmed diagnostic suspicions or suggested the diagnosis earlier than would otherwise have occurred. In five patients, real-time changes in Z were potentially useful in guiding and monitoring the results of therapeutic interventions or changes in clinical condition. This study demonstrates that Z measurement and real-time monitoring can be a useful and noninvasive means of assessing TF status in ED patients. However, it may be most helpful in those patients whose TF status is changing or unstable."

Arginin-vasopressin (AVP) level (1.16 pg/ml) was found inappropriately higher in relation to the severe serum hypoosmolality (261 mmol/kg) and hyponatraemia (117 mmol/l) with relatively high urinary osmolality (590 mmol/kg) and natriuria (684 mmol/24 h). Diagnosis of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH-type C) was confirmed during the water load test. Magnetic resonance imaging and CT scans revealed in the region of hypophysis intrasellar tumour (diameter of 16 mm) and the stabilized finding of temporal cyst. Substitution of sodium losses with the restricted fluid intake resulted in the correction of water-electrolyte balance and the restoration of normal clinical state.

Prevention involves low technology but vigilant care. If the disease progresses, infections can develop, and surgery may be necessary to prevent death. This article examines pressure ulcer correlates in a representative sample of 15,121 nursing home residents in 1994 in the state of Ohio. The prevalence of pressure ulcers was 12%, 8% for Stage 2 or greater. The study found that many nursing home residents remain at great risk of developing pressure ulcers. Important risk factors included a history of cured pressure ulcers, new admission and readmissions, dependencies in activities of daily living, weight loss and dehydration, diabetes, edema, and incontinence. After controlling for clinical factors, residents in rural facilities were less likely to have a pressure ulcer. These findings suggest that the quality of pressure ulcer care in nursing homes could improve."
CD009647,0,22448705,0,[Hyponatremia - carbamazepine medication complications].,"Hyponatremia can be defined like the low sodium concentration, lower that 135 mmol/l. It becomes really serious when the concentration is lower than 120 mmol/l. The most frequent causes of hyponatremia are: the extrarenal loss (GIT, skin, bleeding, sequestration), the renal loss (diuretics, nephritis with the salt loss, osmotical diuresis, the Addison disease), hypothyroidism, the lack of glucocorticoids, emotional stress, pain, pseudohyponatremia (incorrect taking, dyslipoproteinemia). There is fatigue, exhaustion, headache and vertigoes dominating in the clinical record file. By the deficit increasing a patient becomes delirious, comatose even with the shock development. It is necessary to separate sufficient supply of sodium from much more often reason, which is loss of sodium which can be caused by: excessive sweating, vomitting with the metabolical alkalosis development, diarrhoea with the metabolical acidosis development, renal losses (a phase of renal failure). Treatment of hyponatremia: intensive treatment starts at the level of plasmatic concentration of sodium under 120 mmol/l or when neurological symptoms of brain oedema are present. In the therapy it is necessary to avoid fast infusions of hypertonic saline solutions (3-5% NaCl solutions) because of the danger of the development of serious CNS complications (intracranial bleeding, etc.). It is recommended to adjust the plasmatic concentration of sodium up to 120 mmol/l during the first four hours and a subsequent correction should not be higher than 2 mmol per an hour. Treatment of the basic illness is very important. We present 2 case histories: a 74-year old female patient and a 69-year old female patient both with the hyponatremia caused by taking of carbamazepine. We want to inform and warn about not only a well known side effect during long-term treatment but about hyponatremia that arose within 48 hours after the start of taking medicine as well."

CD009647,0,11070762,0,[Operative stress during aorto-bifemoral reconstruction as dependent on a type of anesthesia].,"Abdominal aortic reconstruction surgery in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans usually has been carried out under standard intratracheal anaesthesia and only a some few centres have included continuous suprameningeal anaesthesia. On the basis of that scanty data it seems that combined intratracheal and suprameningeal anaesthesia might have some advantages over the standard anaesthesia owing to reducing general symptoms of perioperative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the operative stress during abdominal aortic reconstruction in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans as dependent on a type of anaesthesia: standard intratracheal and combined-intratracheal supported by suprameningeal doses of anaesthetics. The evaluation of a magnitude of perioperative stress was based on determinations standard markers of stress response in serum: cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline, somatotropic hormone and glucose as well. The assessment of the stress condition during abdominal aortic reconstruction in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans might be of a great importance as most of the patients suffer from ischaemic heart disease. Thus, the choice of an optimal perioperative treatment might improve recovery process. Elective abdominal aortic reconstruction with prosthesis implantation were performed in the year 1995 in 42 patients--8 with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and 34 with aorto-iliac occlusion (AIO) divided at random in 2 comparable groups according to a type of anaesthesia: I--standard, general anaesthesia supported by myorelaxants and by analgetic drugs given intravenously in a postoperative period, II--combined anaesthesia with a standard general anaesthesia fortified by subarachnoid anaesthesia (0.5% bupivacaine with morphine) reaching the T4-T5 dermatome. The case protocol included: duration of surgery, duration of aorta clamping, type of prosthesis, blood loss, fluid balance, serum level of cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline, human growth hormone, glucose, blood morphology, and total creatine kinase activity. Analysing of mean levels of stress markers has shown that they have been lower in combined anaesthesia. It seems that combined anaesthesia is better than the standard anaesthesia owing to reducing general symptoms of perioperative stress."

Results were obtained after single and repeated application (14 days, 2 x a day). The best performing product was then selected and further tested for its potential effects on sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)-damaged skin. This was done in a younger population and the recovery of the impaired barrier function was followed by TEWL measurements. The selected body lotion had a high efficacy, improving both the TEWL and SC hydration of ageing skin by more than 30%. When applied to SLS-damaged skin, the product was able to improve skin barrier repair in comparison with physiological barrier repair. The results of this study show that a combination of non-invasive objective measurements can be used to substantiate product claims.

Compared with thermoneutral control experiments, skin temperature (trunk) fell from 35.5 to 29.5 degrees C, with little change in core temperature. 2. Erythrocyte count rose in the cold from 4.29 to 4.69 x 10(12)/l, without a change in mean corpuscular volume, indicating a 14% or 438 ml decline in plasma volume; increased excretion of water, Na+ and K+ accounted for loss of only 179 ml of extracellular water. 3. Plasma cholesterol and fibrinogen concentrations rose in the elderly subjects from 4.90 mmol/l and 2.97 g/l (control) to 5.45 mmol/l and 3.39 g/l in the cold, and in the young subjects from 3.33 mmol/l and 1.84 g/l (control) to 3.77 mmol/l and 2.07 g/l in the cold. Increases were significant for the elderly subjects, the young subjects and the group as a whole, except for cholesterol in the young subjects, and all were close to those expected from the fall in plasma volume. 4. Plasma levels of Protein C and factor X did not increase significantly in the cold in the elderly subjects, young subjects, or the group as a whole. 5.

History, chemistry, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, clinical use and adverse effects.","Glyburide, a second-generation hypoglycemic sulfonylurea, is 200 times as potent as tolbutamide. This increase is due to greater intrinsic hypoglycemic potency of the molecule rather than to a prolonged biologic half-life. Glyburide is inactivated by the liver to 4-trans-hydroxyglyburide and 3-cis-hydroxyglyburide; 50% of these compounds is excreted in the urine and 50% in the bile. Although the serum concentration of glyburide can be measured by radioimmunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography, the importance of its serum concentration in the reduction of hyperglycemia is not yet established. Glyburide has a therapeutic effectiveness comparable to that of the first-generation sulfonylurea chlorpropamide; however, it has a lower frequency of adverse effects. To date it has a low frequency of clinically significant interactions with other drugs. Glyburide should not be prescribed for patients with liver disease or significant renal disease. Because glyburide is a potent hypoglycemic agent, it should be prescribed in small initial doses, particularly for elderly patients with diabetes. At the present time there is no definite evidence that it modifies the increased risk of cardiovascular disease of diabetic patients. Although glyburide is a potent stimulator of pancreatic insulin secretion after short-term administration, an additional mechanism of action during long-term administration is to decrease the resistance of muscle and liver to the action of insulin. It is a useful medication for patients with type II diabetes whose hyperglycemia is not adequately reduced by dietary management and exercise. It can be used as the initial drug in these patients or as the replacement drug for those with primary or secondary failure during therapy with first-generation sulfonylureas."

In all patients the AVP level rose well above that necessary for maximal antidiuresis (5 fmol ml-1) and then returned to within the normal range (0.5-5.0 fmol ml-1) usually over the next 24 hours. During this period of raised AVP concentration the urine volume, which varied considerably, was closely related to osmolar excretion. With the fall of AVP to normal levels, all but one of the patients eventually exhibited positive free water clearance. However, in most patients the urine remained hypertonic for some hours and its volume continued to be determined mainly by osmolar load which was itself apparently related to glomerular filtration rate. At no time was there a significant relationship between changes in plasma AVP concentration and urinary volume."

Results showed that HCTZ 6.25 mg contributed significantly to the antihypertensive effectiveness of bisoprolol 5 mg. Bisoprolol 5 mg/HCTZ 6.25 mg (B5/H6.25) produced significantly greater mean reductions from baseline in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-15.8 mm Hg/-12.6 mm Hg) than bisoprolol 5 mg alone (-10.0 mm Hg/-10.5 mm Hg) and HCTZ 25 mg alone (-10.2 mm Hg/-8.5 mm Hg). A 73% response rate was achieved with the low-dose formulation compared with 61% for the bisoprolol 5 mg (B5) group and 47% for the HCTZ 25 mg (H25) group. B5/H6.25 was found to be significantly more effective than B5 or H25 in all subgroups of patients, regardless of gender, race, age, or smoking history. Antihypertensive effects were maintained during the 24-hour dosing interval. The incremental effectiveness of B5/H6.25 was not accompanied by an increase in the frequency or severity of adverse experiences; the incidence of adverse experiences in the B5/H6.25 group was comparable to that in the placebo group. B5/H6.25 was shown to provide safety advantages over H25, as shown by less hypokalemia (< 1% with B5/H6.25 versus 6.5% with H25).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The worsening of the confusional state in spite of normalisation of natremia, and the progressive development of anemia and thrombocytopenia, leads to the discovery of a new onset severe hypophosphatemia. The rapid fall in plasma levels of phosphorus, magnesium and potassium are the main futures of the refeeding syndrome. Its clinical manifestations are neurological, muscular, haematological and renal. The development of this syndrome is associated with a high mortality. The refeeding syndrome is seen when carbohydrates are introduced after a period of malnutrition. Identification of patients at risk for the refeeding syndrome (anorexia nervosa, chronic alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, elderly patients, oncology patients), the introduction of cautious progressive nutrition and the careful monitoring of vital signs, electrolytes levels and fluid balance, allows to prevent morbidity and mortality of this syndrome."
CD009647,0,7676788,0,Interstitial fluid volume during cardiac surgery measured by means of a non-invasive conductivity technique.,"Fluid accumulation in the interstitium is frequently found after cardiac surgery. In extreme this can lead to pulmonary and myocardial oedema. The origin of this accumulation is not exactly known and may be twofold. It is probably a combination of the noninfectious whole body inflammatory response and a change in Starling forces due to a decrease in colloid osmotic pressure (COP) which is caused by the primed extracorporeal circuit. To study the changes in interstitial fluid volume (ISFV) a non-invasive conductivity technique was used. The relationship between temperature and conductivity was first investigated in vitro. A linear relationship was found between conductivity and different saline solutions and temperature. From the in vitro experiments it can be concluded that temperature corrected conductivity does not depend on haematocrit. After the in vitro experiments eleven patients undergoing cardiac surgery were studied. During the first minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) a steep significant decrease in COP to 61.4 +/- 6.9% (from 19.6 +/- 1.1 to 12.0 +/- 1.2 mmHg), and a rise in ISFV to 105.5 +/- 2.8% (from 12.3 +/- 1.4 mS to 14.0 +/- 1.3 mS) was noticed. After this decrease COP increased significantly, till the end of the operation, but did not reach the pre-operative level. An increase in ISFV was noticed till the rewarming point. After this point no significant change in ISFV was noticed. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the fluid balance and the ISFV increase at the start, at the end of CPB, and at the end of the operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009647,0,9522386,0,Monitoring relative fluid balance alterations in haemodialysis of diabetic patients by electrical impedance.,"Measurements of total-body electrical impedance in the frequency range between 200 Hz and 300 kHz were performed on 37 diabetic patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis. Special attention was paid to the instrument design, where a self-balancing differential current source was used, reducing considerably the common-mode voltage at the amplifier input. The patient-instrument interface includes screened leads, separately driven by unity-gain buffers. The measurement error was < 1% for the impedance within the range of 20 to 1000 omega and < 0.3 degree (mean) for the phase angle. Impedance/phase and ultrafiltration measurements were carried out throughout the entire procedure. Total and extracellular water were computed and compared with extracted fluid volumes. The trends of change of the extracellular and intracellular fluid volumes during and immediately after dialysis corresponded to the respective clinical condition of the patients and enabled us to divide them into four groups. This approach is a step toward continuous monitoring and adaptive treatment, tailored to the individual patient needs."
CD009647,0,12910166,0,[Anatomo-physiological aspects of the lower urinary tract in men and modifications related to ageing].,"MICTURITION AND INCONTINENCE: The lower urinary tract, composed of several organs necessary for micturition, is controlled by the encephalic and peripheral centres, which have a synergic effect and coordinate the lower urinary tract. Continence is ensured by the effect of the adrenergic sympathetic nerve that increases urethral sphincter tonus and maintains low pressure in the bladder during filling. Micturition appeals to the cholinergic system mediated by the muscarinic receptors situated in the bladder. AGEING OF THE PROSTATE: Under the influence of dihydrotestosterone and growth factors, ageing of the prostate is characterized by histological modifications leading to hypertrophy, obstructing the flow of urine. AGEING OF THE BLADDER: Electronic microscopy studies have shown the presence of degenerative lesions and, on urodynamic level, are characterised by over or under-activity. Ageing of the peripheral and central nervous centres is morphological and metabolic with the production of vascular and free radicals, involving the systems that control micturition and continence. The ageing kidney has a tendency to produce more urine at night because of the functional changes that intervene in the salt and water balance regulation systems."
CD009647,0,2095179,0,"Frictional properties of human skin: relation to age, sex and anatomical region, stratum corneum hydration and transepidermal water loss.","Differences in the dynamic skin friction coefficients (mu) were investigated with respect to age, sex, and anatomical region. A total of 29 volunteers consisting of seven young females, seven old females, seven young males, and eight old males participated in the study. Measurements were obtained from II anatomical regions, namely, the forehead, upper arm, volar and dorsal forearm, postauricular, palm, abdomen, upper and lower back, thigh, and ankle. The friction data were compared with stratum corneum hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL). The dynamic friction coefficient did not vary significantly between age and sex groups but varied considerably among the anatomical regions of the body. The forehead and postauricular had the highest mu (0.34 +/- 0.02) while the abdomen had the lowest (0.12 +/- 0.01); the remaining regions had an average mu value of 0.21 +/- 0.01. Similarly, no sex differences were observed for TEWL and stratum corneum hydration. Capacitance was only significantly lower on the palms of the elderly. Regional differences showed a higher state of hydration on the forehead and postauricular as well as the upper arm, upper and lower back when compared with the volar forearm. TEWL was generally lower in the elderly on all anatomical regions except the postauricular and palm. A significant correlation was established between mu and capacitance for most regions. Between mu and TEWL significant correlation was observed only on the palm and thigh. These findings suggest that frictional properties of skin are dependent on more than water content or non-apparent sweating and the role of sebum secretion is suggested as one possible factor."
CD009647,0,10569323,0,Pulmonary artery wedge pressure and extravascular lung water in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema requiring mechanical ventilation.,"This study describe the values of pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) and the extravascular lung water (EVLW) index in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema who require mechanical ventilation. Ten consecutive patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema who required mechanical ventilation were studied. Cardiac index was determined with thermodilution. Central venous pressure and PAWP were measured with a pulmonary artery catheter. EVLW index was determined with the thermal dye dilution technique, using a commercially available computer system. Measurements were made at regular preset intervals after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. PAWP was normal at baseline (11.6+/-0.9 mm Hg, range 8 to 17) and did not change. EVLW index was elevated at baseline (13.7+/-1.5 ml/ kg) and decreased to a normal value after 24 hours (8.6+/-1.2 ml/kg, p = 0.02). Concomitantly cardiac index increased from 2.61+/-0.24 to 3.61+/-0.14 L/min/m2 (p = 0.05). There was no correlation between PAWP and EVLW index. Fluid balance was +1,221+/-908 ml after 24 hours and there was a weight gain of 0.88+/-1.06 kg after 24 hours. Thus, patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema requiring mechanical ventilation may have a normal PAWP after mechanical ventilation has been initiated. In a hemodynamic unstable situation, these patients may require fluid challenges to improve cardiac output, despite the presence of pulmonary edema. The pulmonary edema, measured as EVLW index, resolves rapidly when cardiac performance improves, despite positive fluid balances and weight gain in the first 24 hours."

The patient was admitted to our hospital complaining of slight cough with low-grade fever, and treated with piperacillin sodium, resulting in complete resolution of the symptoms, following a diagnosis of bronchopneumonia. Thereafter, however, she began to complain of vomiting, abdominal pain, facial numbness and paresis of the extremities with gait disturbance, and became comatose with hyponatremia (serum Na concentration 119 mEq/L) in a few days. Laboratory tests revealed an antidiuretic hormone (ADH) level of 13.5 pg/mL, plasma osmolality 218 mOsm/KgH2O, urinary osmolality 429 mOsm/KgH20, urinary Na concentration > 20 mEq/L, and no abnormalities of thyroid, adrenal or renal function. Neither edema nor dehydration was evident. These data indicated the presence of SIADH. No abnormalities suggestive of malignant or infectious diseases such as lung cancer, pneumonia and Guillain-Barré syndrome were evident from laboratory and roentgenographic findings. As the cause of SIADH, therefore, porphyria was suspected. Metabolites and activities of enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway were examined, and very low activity of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D) (0.14 mumol PBG/mL RBC/h) was found. The patient was neither an alcoholic nor a heavy smoker, and she had no past history of heavy metal intoxication, photosensitivity or tyrosinemia. On the basis of these data and clinical features, she was diagnosed as having ADP. We consider this to be the first case of ADP reported in Japan."

CD009647,0,9129268,0,Exercise immunology: practical applications.,"During the last 95 years, 629 papers (60% in the 1990s) dealing specifically with exercise and immunology have been published. Major findings of practical importance in terms of public health and athletic endeavor include: (a) In response to acute exercise (the most frequently studied area of exercise immunology), a rapid interchange of immune cells between peripheral lymphoid tissues and the circulation occurs. The response depends on many factors, including the intensity, duration, and mode of exercise, concentrations of hormones and cytokines, change in body temperature, blood flow, hydration status, and body position. Of all immune cells, natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages (of the innate immune system) appear to be most responsive to the effects of acute exercise, both in terms of numbers and function. In general, acute exercise bouts of moderate duration (< 60 min) and intensity (< 60% VO2max) are associated with fewer perturbations and less stress to the immune system than are prolonged, high-intensity sessions. (b) In response to long-term exercise training, the only finding to date reported with some congruity between investigators is a significant elevation in NK cell activity. Changes in the function of neutrophils, macrophages, and T and B cells in response to training have been reported inconsistently, but there is some indication that neutrophil function is suppressed during periods of heavy training. (c) Limited data suggest that unusually heavy acute or chronic exercise may increase the risk of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), while regular moderate physical activity may reduce URTI symptomatology. (d) Work performance tends to diminish with most systemic infectious, and clinical case studies and animal data suggest that infection severity, relapse, and myocarditis may result when patients exercise vigorously. (e) Although regular exercise has many benefits for HIV-infected individuals, helper T cell counts and other immune measures are not enhanced significantly. (f) Data suggest that the incidence and mortality rates for certain types of cancer are lower among active subjects. The role of the immune system may be limited, however, depending on the sensitivity of the specific tumor to cytolysis, the stage of cancer, the type of exercise program, and many other complex factors. (g) As individuals age, they experience a decline in most cell- mediated and humoral immune responses. Two human studies suggest that immune function is superior in highly conditioned versus sedentary elderly subjects. (h) Mental stress, undernourishment, quick weight loss, and improper hygiene have each been associated with impaired immunity. Athletes who are undergoing heavy training regimens should realize that each of these factors has the potential to compound the effect that exercise stress is having on their immune systems."

These differences have important implications for the treatment of angina pectoris. Our clinical experience over a period of 6 years with all types of angina patients--mostly those with chronic stable angina but also those with Prinzmetal's and unstable angina-corroborates the efficacy reports published in the world literature. Although the safety profile of nifedipine has been generally regarded as favorable, a few reports of clinically significant adverse effects in specific patient groups have appeared in the literature. In order to provide a more comprehensive assessment of safety, the records of over 3000 patients treated with nifedipine in open and controlled multiple-dose studies were tabulated and analyzed. Of special concern were patients with clinically significant adverse experiences, patients with a concomitant diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF), patients who were being treated concurrently with beta blockers, and patients who had been taking nifedipine for more than 6 months. Results of this analysis confirm that nifedipine can be safely administered to a broad spectrum of angina patients, including those with a concomitant diagnosis of CHF and those receiving concurrent therapy with beta-blocking agents."

Measurements were taken before and after 1 month in hospital on a diet of 330kCal/day designed to ensure 34 g protein and 65 mmol sodium. Mean +/- s.d. body mass index in the whole group fell from 40.8 +/- 7.6 to 37.2 +/- 7.4 kg/m2 (P less than 0.0001).

CD009647,0,7942597,0,Variation in the enteric distribution of cryptosporidia in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,"Clinical observation suggests that the natural history of intestinal cryptosporidiosis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome varies greatly. The relation between clinical, small-bowel functional, and nutritional status and the intestinal distribution of the organism was studied in 41 patients who had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and cryptosporidiosis and who had undergone both proximal small-bowel and colonic biopsies. Two patterns of enteric cryptosporidiosis were identified: severe clinical disease with malabsorption in patients with cryptosporidia in proximal small-bowel biopsy specimens (61% of cases) and less severe clinical disease in patients with cryptosporidia only in the colon or stool (39% of cases). Patients with cryptosporidia in proximal small-bowel biopsy specimens had small-bowel crypt hyperplastic villous atrophy, lamina propria inflammatory infiltrates, poorer D-xylose absorption, greater weight loss, and shorter survival and more often needed intravenous hydration or hyperalimentation. Patients with cryptosporidia in the small-bowel villi only had less severe disease than those with cryptosporidia in the small-bowel crypts. In conclusion, the anatomic distribution of intestinal cryptosporidia in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome varies, and this variation may explain differences in clinical course. Cryptosporidial infection of the proximal small bowel correlates with mucosal injury, malabsorption, dehydration, weight loss, and shortened survival."

The groups were compared after an overnight period of recumbency and fasting (10 hours) and after postural stimulation (20 minutes standing). Plasma norepinephrine concentrations were slightly, though not significantly, higher in older men after prolonged recumbency (older men, 232 +/- 39 pg/ml; younger men, 183 +/- 24 pg/ml). After postural stimulation, the plasma norepinephrine levels were elevated in both groups, but the measured increase of the older group was significantly greater than that of the younger group (older men, 607 +/- 72 pg/ml; younger men, 393 +/- 51 pg/ml; P less than 0.05). The results of this study suggest the greater response of plasma norepinephrine to postural stimulation observed in elderly men occurred even though the extracellular fluid volume statuses of the older group were comparable to those of the younger group. Whether the exaggerated plasma norepinephrine response of the older men represented a higher degree of sympathetic activity or a diminished plasma clearance of norepinephrine was not established."

Factor analyses indicated and confirmed ""Fluid and electrolyte imbalance"" and ""Disturbance in neuromuscular function"" domains. Support for concurrent validity was provided by correlation (r = -0.46) between the entire scale and the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS). For Factor I the correlation was -0.51, for Factor II the correlation was -0.33. The predictive validity of the PSDS was supported through multiple regression. These findings suggest that the PSDS is a reliable and valid measure of symptom distress for ESRD patients treated with hemodialysis."
CD009647,0,3398981,0,Primary role of hyperkalemia in the acidosis of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism.,"A 65-year-old woman with mild renal insufficiency had persistent hyperkalemia and hyperchloremic acidosis. Her plasma aldosterone level was relatively low for her hyperkalemia, and her urine pH was low. Fludrocortisone acetate administration corrected both hyperkalemia and acidosis by increasing urinary excretion of potassium and net acid, implicating deficient mineralocorticoid activity in the distal renal tubule in this patient. During this medication urinary ammonium excretion increased, but urine pH remained low, so that urinary titratable acid excretion did not decrease. On the other hand, correction of hyperkalemia by administration of a potassium-calcium exchange resin alone also resolved the acidosis by increasing urinary ammonium excretion. This increment exceeded the decrement of urinary titratable acid excretion, which was caused by raised urine pH secondary to increased urinary ammonium excretion, and resulted in increase of net acid excretion. Thus, in this patient, hyperkalemia appears to be a decisive causative factor in the acidosis, with deficient mineralocorticoid effect only contributing in part to the reduction of net acid excretion and the acidosis."

Subjects were 14 healthy weight-stable obese (BMI > or =30 kg/m(2)) postmenopausal women >55 yr who participated in a 16-wk, 1, 200 kcal/day nutritionally complete diet. Measures at baseline and 16 wk included FFM and appendicular lean soft tissue (LST) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; body cell mass (BCM) by (40)K whole body counting; total body water (TBW) by tritium dilution; skeletal muscle (SM) by whole body MRI; and fasting whole body protein metabolism through L-[1-(13)C]leucine kinetics. Mean weight loss (+/-SD) was 9.6+/-3.0 kg (P<0.0001) or 10.7% of initial body weight. FFM decreased by 2.1+/-2.6 kg (P = 0.006), or 19.5% of weight loss, and did not differ from that reported (2.3+/-0.7 kg). Relative losses of SM, LST, TBW, and BCM were consistent with reductions in body weight and FFM. Changes in [(13)C]leucine flux, oxidation, and synthesis rates were not significant. Follow-up of 11 subjects at 23.7 +/-5.7 mo showed body weight and fat mass to be below baseline values; FFM was nonsignificantly reduced. Weight loss was accompanied by body composition and protein kinetic changes that appear appropriate for the magnitude of body mass change, thus failing to support the concern that diet-induced weight loss in obese postmenopausal women produces disproportionate LST losses."

CD009647,0,14569641,0,Elder neglect and abuse. A primer for primary care physicians.,"Elder neglect and abuse represent a widespread, largely undiagnosed problem in the United States. Factors contributing to misdiagnosis and underreporting include denial by both the victim and the perpetrator, clinicians' reluctance to report victims, disbelief by medical providers, and clinicians' lack of awareness of warning signs. Physical abuse is most recognizable, yet neglect is most common. Psychological and financial abuse may be more easily missed. Elder neglect and abuse have many clinical presentations, ranging from the overt appearance of bruises and fractures, to the subtle appearance of dehydration, depression, and apathy. Risk factors are varied and may be categorized by victim or perpetrator. Dependency, on the part of the victim or perpetrator, and caregiver stress are frequent common denominators in abusive situations. Increasingly, Institutionalization is recognized as a risk factor for neglect and abuse. Most states require primary care providers to report suspected elder abuse. Awareness of the risk factors and clinical manifestations allows primary care physicians to provide early detection and intervention for elder neglect and abuse."

CD009647,0,23570891,0,The complex interplay of depression and falls in older adults: a clinical review.,"Depression and falls have a significant bidirectional relationship. Excessive fear of falling, which is frequently associated with depression, also increases the risk of falls. Both depression and fear of falling are associated with impairment of gait and balance, an association that is mediated through cognitive, sensory, and motor pathways. The management of depression in fall-prone individuals is challenging, since antidepressant medications can increase the risk of falls, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may increase the risk of fragility fractures, and data are lacking about the effect of fall rehabilitation programs on clinically significant depression. Based on the current state of knowledge, exercise (particularly Tai Chi) and cognitive-behavioral therapy should be considered for the first-line treatment of mild depression in older fallers. Antidepressant medications are indicated to treat moderate to severe depression in fall-prone individuals, but with appropriate precautions including low starting dose and slow dose titration, use of psychotropic monotherapy whenever possible, and monitoring for orthostatic hypotension and hyponatremia. To date, there have been no recommendations for osteoporosis monitoring and treatment in individuals prescribed antidepressant medications, beyond the usual clinical guidelines. However, treatment of the older depressed person who is at risk of falls provides the opportunity to inquire about his or her adherence with osteoporosis and fracture prevention guidelines."

Before irradiation 12 patients received chemotherapy alone, 17 chemotherapy and irradiation of a primary focus and 2 surgery followed by chemotherapy. Simultaneously with a primary tumor brain metastases were found in 6 out of 7 patients. Brain involvement in 24 patients occurred 2.5-26.4 mos. after initiation of treatment. The presence of brain metastases was confirmed by the clinical symptoms, the electroencephalography and computerized tomography data. Brain irradiation in most of the patients was done in the presence of dehydration therapy. Twenty-four patients received a complete preplanned therapeutic course, in the other 7 patients treatment had to be interrupted because of the aggravation of symptoms. A complete regression of different brain symptoms was observed in 60-100% of the cases, the improvement of the focal symptoms and the state of the higher nervous activity was observed in a somewhat less percentage of the cases. Six out of 24 patients lived for 1 year and longer after irradiation of brain metastases. The results of this study have shown that brain metastases of small cell pulmonary carcinoma respond to radiotherapy. The dose of 30-40 Gy is sufficient to do away with severe neurological symptoms in most of the patients."

After a two day fluid and salt balance control period, oral piretanide 6 mg induced a natriuresis and kaliuresis, which was proportional to the GFR of the patients. The ratio of drug-induced K+ to Na+ excretion was always 0.13, independent of individual GFR. This was only true for the duration of the action of piretanide, tau, which was 6 h in subjects with normal GFR and 5 h in patients with impaired kidney function. Surprisingly, after tau, i.e. for 24 h after drug administration, less potassium was lost than in the pretreatment period. Neither the GFR nor the renal blood flow (PAH clearance) of the patients were affected by piretanide. In conclusion, piretanide given once a day was an effective natriuretic agent, even in end-stage renal disease, and it produced relatively little K(+)-loss when given once daily."
CD009647,0,1699443,0,[Hyperosmolar volume replacement in heart surgery].,"The ideal solution for use in volume therapy is still a matter of debate. Hypertonic sodium (HS) solutions have been advocated for resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock (small volume resuscitation). As hypertonic fluids may also be of interest in cardiac surgery, the effects of a new HS solution were studied. METHODS. In 90 patients undergoing aorto-coronary bypass grafting studies were performed at three different periods: I (n = 30) after induction of anesthesia (before onset of the operation); II (n = 30) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB); III (n = 30) after termination of bypass. During these periods the patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups with 10 patients in each group: group 1 received a new hypertonic solution prepared in hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solution (72 g/l NaCl, 60 g/l HES, 2400 mosmol/l; HS-HES patients), group 2 received a 6% HES solution (200/0.5; HES patients), and group 3 received no volume infusion and served as controls. RESULTS. After the induction of anesthesia, significantly less HS-HES solution (4.5 +/- 0.5 ml/kg) than 6% HES solution (10.1 +/- 1.4 ml/kg) was necessary to double the baseline PCWP. The fluid balance during CPB was negative in the patients who had received HS-HES preoperatively (-0.03 +/- 0.01 ml/kg.min CPB), whereas 6% HES (+0.06 +/- 0.02 ml/kg.min CPB) and control patients (+0.13 +/- 0.03 ml/kg.min CPB) had a positive fluid balance. Both after the induction of anesthesia and after termination of bypass, CI increased more in the HS-HES group than in the HES patients, and it even decreased in the control group. SVR decreased in the HS-HES patients, whereas it increased in the control group. Rapid infusion of HS-HES during CPB was followed by a significant, but short-lasting decrease in MAP (-40 mmHg) and an increase in the oxygenator volume. Pulmonary gas exchange (= paO2) was least compromised in the HS-HES patients; the sodium concentration increased only in the HS-HES patients, but never exceeded 150 mmol/l. DISCUSSION. Cardiac surgery procedures offer a special situation for volume therapy as there is a possibility of deterioration in the macro- and microcirculation before, after, and during the period of CPB. Hemodynamic effects of the new HS-HES solution included an increase in CI and a decrease in SVR, which were not merely transient as has been reported which hypertonic saline solution used alone. It was also observed that HS-HES patients required significantly smaller volumes of fluids, both during CPB and during the early postoperative period. This effect seems to be due to a redistribution of interstitial fluid to the intravascular space, possibly decreasing tissue edema. CONCLUSION. The hypertonic saline HES solution adds a new dimension to volume therapy for cardiac surgery patients. The improvement in hemodynamics was effective and not only transient. Fluid requirements were significantly reduced during as well as after CPB, and pulmonary gas exchange was least compromised in these patients."

CD009647,0,1424891,0,Assessing hypermetabolism and hypometabolism in the postoperative critically ill patient.,"To determine whether a patient is hypermetabolic or hypometabolic, measured resting energy expenditure is compared with estimated (or predicted) energy expenditure. The latter is calculated using equations derived from measurements made in groups of healthy individuals. Body weight or body surface area are among the variables used in these equations. Yet, in critically ill patients, body weight often rises because of fluid resuscitation. This study examined the differences between using preoperative, postoperative, and ideal body weights on the determination of hypermetabolism and hypometabolism in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients. When the elevated postoperative weights were used instead of the preoperative ones to predict energy expenditure, the degree of hypermetabolism was underestimated. Subtracting the weight of the cumulative net fluid balance from the postoperative weight was found to accurately reflect preoperative weight. The influence of various predictive equations on the magnitude of hypermetabolism was also explored. In conclusion, it is important, when determining hypermetabolism or hypometabolism, to consider the influence of the specific predictive equation used and the effect of resuscitation fluid."

CD009647,0,19666518,0,A loss-of-function nonsynonymous polymorphism in the osmoregulatory TRPV4 gene is associated with human hyponatremia.,"Disorders of water balance are among the most common and morbid of the electrolyte disturbances, and are reflected clinically as abnormalities in the serum sodium concentration. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel is postulated to comprise an element of the central tonicity-sensing mechanism in the mammalian hypothalamus, and is activated by hypotonic stress in vitro. A nonsynonymous polymorphism in the TRPV4 gene gives rise to a Pro-to-Ser substitution at residue 19. We show that this polymorphism is significantly associated with serum sodium concentration and with hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration < or =135 mEq/L) in 2 non-Hispanic Caucasian male populations; in addition, mean serum sodium concentration is lower among subjects with the TRPV4(P19S) allele relative to the wild-type allele. Subjects with the minor allele were 2.4-6.4 times as likely to exhibit hyponatremia as subjects without the minor allele (after inclusion of key covariates). Consistent with these observations, a human TRPV4 channel mutated to incorporate the TRPV4(P19S) polymorphism showed diminished response to hypotonic stress (relative to the wild-type channel) and to the osmotransducing lipid epoxyeicosatrienoic acid in heterologous expression studies. These data suggest that this polymorphism affects TRPV4 function in vivo and likely influences systemic water balance on a population-wide basis."

In this study the effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) enriched with glutamine on some selected immunological and nutritional parameters was examined in twelve surgical patients with sepsis and malnutrition. The reason for glutamine supplementation was lack of clinical improvement after standard TPN. All patients received TPN enriched with glutamine for 10 days. Phenotypic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear subsets (CD4, CD8, CD16, CD56, HLA-DR) were measured before, during (on days 2, 4, 6) glutamine administration and two days after (day 12) glutamine withdrawal. Simultaneously some nutritional parameters were assessed. The number and percentage of CD4, CD16, CD56 mononuclear subsets increased significantly on day 2 and stayed on the same level during observation (with exception in CD4 on day 6, 12 and CD56 on day 4). No significant differences in CD8 and HLA-DR number and percentages were observed after TPN enriched with glutamine. BIA examination revealed on days 2 and 12 significant decrease of total body water and significant increase of body cell mass, intracellular water on day 12. It was correlated with significant higher total lymphocytes count and significantly higher total protein, serum albumin, transferrin, cholesterol and CRP concentration. Results demonstrated that TPN supplemented with glutamine improved rapidly some immunological and nutritional parameters in surgical, malnutrition patients with sepsis."

In a randomized, double blind study of 30 patients undergoing coronary angiography we therefore examined the electrophysiological and hemodynamic effects of the two low osmolality contrast media-ioxaglate (with sodium) and iohexol (without sodium). Standard ECG, aortic blood pressure, and His bundle electrocardiogram were recorded. The contrast media were well tolerated and no serious arrhythmias were observed. Both induced a transient decrement in systolic blood pressure and reduction in heart rate 10 s following contrast injection (all P less than 0.01). Ioxaglate prolonged the QT interval at 10 s (P less than 0.01) and also when analysed for the whole observation period (120 s) (P less than 0.05), whereas iohexol did not cause any significant changes in the QT-interval. The AH-interval was prolonged by ioxaglate at 10 s (P less than 0.01), but not altered by iohexol. Thus, other factors than osmolality and sodium content might contribute to QT prolongation, since only the contrast agents with sodium (ioxaglate) induced QT prolongation in this study."
CD009647,0,2795975,0,[Perioperative water and electrolyte metabolism and its abnormalities in aged patients].,"The number of aged surgical patients is increasing due to the increase of aged people in the general population. Aged surgical patients above 65 years of age constituted about 30% of all ICU patients in our institution. Perioperative care for aged patients has now become one of the most important clinical activities in the ICU. The perioperative management for those aged patients should be performed with great care because these patients have some abnormalities in water and electrolyte metabolism. Aged patients showed decreased blood levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and decreased creatinine clearance even in the preoperative period. The ANP level and the creatinine clearance showed significant negative correlation, indicating that one of the reasons for impaired renal function among aged patients could be the decreased ANP level in blood. The intraoperative insults to the aged surgical patients undergoing radical operation for esophageal cancer tended to be smaller compared to that in the younger patients. Intraoperative infusion volume and urinary output were also smaller in the aged group compared to those in the younger group. The postoperative infusion therapy in the ICU mainly consisted of intravenous hyperalimentation with decreased Na content and the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma. This regimen should be more suitable for the aged patients. Even though the aged and the younger group received the same infusion therapy during their postoperative ICU stay up to the 7th day, the aged patients showed the tendency of Na and Cl retention and increase in anion gap. However, these abnormalities in water and electrolyte metabolism were not so severe as to cause clinical symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009647,0,3974538,0,Influence of alternate-day prednisolone administration on urinary electrolyte excretion.,"The administration of 30 mg of prednisolone on an alternate-day schedule produced an increase in sodium and potassium excretion, followed by a compensatory decline on the succeeding nontreatment day. Water and electrolyte excretion in patients receiving a daily steroid treatment was intermediate between that on the treatment and nontreatment days in the patients on an alternate-day schedule. Fractional sodium and potassium excretion was significantly lower on the nontreatment days as compared to the treatment days. Body weight loss, elevated serum albumin, slightly reduced serum potassium and significantly decreased cortisol concentrations were found in the morning on the nontreatment days, while serum sodium and plasma aldosterone concentrations, and the creatinine clearance rate did not change significantly. Replacement of steroid-induced body fluid loss lessened a decline in water and electrolyte excretion on the nontreatment days.

Twenty-four hospitalized patients with essential hypertension received placebo followed by 10, 25, 50, or 100 mg of tripamide daily in a randomized, double-blind design. All doses of tripamide significantly lowered standing arterial pressure. Changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and weight were not dose related, but the decrease in mean arterial pressure was significantly related to both age (P less than 0.02) and pretreatment blood pressure (P less than 0.05). Serum potassium levels were lowered significantly by the 25 and 100 mg daily doses of tripamide, whereas all doses of tripamide significantly reduced serum chloride levels and produced an increase in serum uric acid levels. Disparate time courses of antihypertensive and diuretic effects and the lack of a relationship between the increase in urine volume and the change in blood pressure suggest an additional antihypertensive action of tripamide or a delayed physiologic adaptation to volume depletion. Equal antihypertensive effects over the range of 10 to 100 mg/day, but greater hypokalemia at higher doses, suggest that future studies should employ the lower doses of tripamide."
CD009647,0,378092,0,"Positive end expiratory pressure ventilation, renal function and renin.","Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during respirator therapy can impair renal function by altering renal haemodynamics or by increasing the secretion of the antidiuretic hormone. In the present study, the effect of the commonly used 10 cm H2O PEEP for two hours on renal function and on plasma renin activity was studied in eleven intensive care patients. During the examination period, the patients received analgesic, sedative, and muscle relaxant drugs, but no diuretics. PEEP decreased the mean urinary output by 21%. Urinary specific gravity and osmolality increased. Urinary sodium excretion decreased along with urinary volume. The creatinine clearance decreased slightly, but free water clearance became less negative suggesting reduced ability of tubules to concentrate urine during PEEP. The plasma renin activity was not altered significnalty by PEEP, nor did the urinary sodium/potassium ratio change. This may indicate that the water retention induced by PEEP is not caused by the increased secretion of aldosterone. The results suggest that 10 cm H2O PEEP impairs renal function in critically ill patients and causes mainly water retention."
CD009647,0,8193750,0,Modes of presentation and management of inflammatory aneurysms of the abdominal aorta.,"The preoperative diagnosis of inflammatory aneurysms of the abdominal aorta (IAAA) is seldom made, yet knowledge of its presence would be an aid to the surgeon. A heightened awareness of the variety of clinical presentations of IAAA should prompt the clinician to consider this entity in the differential diagnosis of back pain, weight loss and obstructive uropathy. Hypovolemic shock, gastrointestinal bleeding and asymptomatic IAAA have also occurred, albeit much less frequently. Patients who are hemodynamically stable might benefit from a short period of diagnostic and therapeutic measures before operation. Patients undergoing aneurysm repair on an ""urgent"" rather than ""emergent"" basis have been shown to have lower mortality and morbidity rates with enhancement of their cardiopulmonary and renal status.

CD009647,0,9044340,0,Sodium profiling in elderly haemodialysis patients.,"Intradialytic vascular instability continues to be one of the most frequent complications in elderly haemodialysis patients. Signs of impending hypotension such as sweating, apprehension, tachycardia, nausea, or vomiting may be infrequent in the geriatric population. The onset of hypotension in the elderly may be sudden and profound and may lead to serious consequences such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or aspiration if not treated promptly. Prevention of vascular instability is extremely important in the elderly. Avoiding rapid ultrafiltration sedatives, or antihypertensive medications and food intake may be beneficial. Optimal dialysate composition (dialysate sodium, bicarbonate, and calcium concentration) is important. Dialysate sodium profiling may be useful in the elderly to reduce intradialytic hypotension. Step sodium profiles result in better plasma volume refilling in early dialysis, while linear dialysate sodium profiles have greater plasma volume in late dialysis, suggesting that dialysate sodium profiles may need to be individualized for optimal response. Sodium profiling could also result in sodium retention, and long-term studies are needed in the elderly before their widespread use is recommended. Use of newer modalities such as continuous monitoring of plasma volume with Crit Line, and determination and monitoring of body-fluid compartments with bioimpedance may further improve vascular stability in the elderly."

Low sodium dialysis, whether with acetate or bicarbonate, was less satisfactory. In contrast to the beneficial effect of an increased sodium concentration, the use of bicarbonate instead of acetate appeared to make little difference either to the patient's symptoms, to the control of blood pressure or to changes in blood gases or biochemistry. Careful choice of dialysate sodium concentration appears to be important in lessening dialysis side-effects. Substitution of bicarbonate for acetate in chronic stable dialysis patients has comparatively little benefit and the choice can legitimately be made on the basis of cost and technical considerations."

Nevertheless, the usual methods of body composition assessment can be misleading in patients with HF because tissue hydration is altered. Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) works without making any assumption about constant soft tissue hydration. In this study, patients with HF and systolic dysfunction (HFS) and preserved systolic function (HFPSF) underwent a body composition evaluation by the BIVA method; the comparison was done between New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes I-II and III-IV."
CD009647,0,2187681,0,Delirium in the elderly.,"Delirium, an acute confusional state, is an organic brain syndrome that manifests deficits in attention, irrelevant or rambling speech, and other cognitive deficits. Its symptoms often fluctuate over the course of the day, and patients may be hyperactive--for example, restless and screaming--or hypoactive--for example, quiet, inactive, and stuporous. Occurring in approximately 20% of hospitalized elderly patients, delirium is the most common psychiatric syndrome in acutely ill general medical and surgical patients. Fifteen to 30% of delirious patients expire, and others are prone to a variety of complications: falls, pressure ulcers, oversedation, dehydration, and others. Almost any acute illness can cause delirium in the elderly, but the most common offenders are acute infections and drugs. Many patients have a pre-existing dementia. The first step in arriving at a correct diagnosis is to distinguish delirium from other psychiatric syndromes that can cause confusion, such as dementia, depression, schizophrenia, and mania. Once delirium is established, a comprehensive general examination and a mental status examination is required. Routine laboratory and radiologic tests are directed at the common metabolic and infectious disorders that precipitate delirium. Treatment is directed at the underlying acute illness. In all patients, it is important (1) to treat the underlying acute illness, (2) to provide appropriate fluid and electrolytes, (3) to discontinue any unnecessary drugs, and (4) to allay the patient's fear and agitation through the use of simple, repetitive instructions, orientation cues, and by limiting the use of physical restraints. If psychotropic medications are needed to treat psychotic symptoms, to prevent patients from harming themselves or others, or to facilitate necessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, then haloperidol is the drug of choice in most instances. Drugs with anticholinergic properties should be avoided."
CD009647,0,3082302,0,The relationship between resting energy expenditure and weight loss in benign and malignant disease.,"The relationship between cancer, weight loss, and resting energy expenditure (REE) has been investigated in 136 patients using indirect calorimetry. Ninety-one patients had gastric, colorectal, or nonsmall cell bronchial neoplasm, seven patients had other malignancies, and 38 patients had nonmalignant illness. Four groups were studied: weight stable cancer patients (CWS: N = 56), weight losing cancer patients (CWL: N = 42), weight stable patients with nonmalignant illness (NCWS: N = 22), and weight losing patients with nonmalignant illness (NCWL: N = 16). In each group REE correlated significantly with body weight, metabolic body size, and lean body mass (LBM: estimated from total body water measurements). The closest correlation was between REE and lean body mass, with the slope of the CWL regression line differing significantly from that of the CWS (p less than 0.05) and NCWS (p less than 0.02) groups. However, there was no difference in REE expressed as kcal/kg LBM/d between the groups. The slopes of the regressions between REE and LBM were almost identical when all cancer patients were compared with all patients with nonmalignant illness. However, when all weight stable patients were compared with all weight losing patients, there was a highly significant difference between the slopes of the regressions (p less than 0.005). This indicates that the weight losing state rather than the presence or absence of cancer is responsible for an alteration in the relationship between REE and LBM. There were no differences in REE between the different tumor types. It is concluded that REE is not elevated in patients with gastric, colorectal, or nonsmall cell bronchial cancer. Elevation of REE contributes very little to the etiology of cancer cachexia."

CD009647,0,843146,0,Renin reactivity as a determinant of responsiveness to antihypertensive treatment.,"In 79 patients with essential hypertension, treatment with propranolol hydrochloride and chlorthalidone together produced significantly greater falls in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures than were obtained with either drug alone. There were no differences between patients in the high, normal, and low renin subgroups in their responsiveness to this combination. Although plasma renin level during combined treatment was twice as high as it was in the untreated control, aldosterone excretion actually decreased. These divergent changes may have been influenced by the renin-raising and aldosterone-lowering effects of the marked hypokalemia observed during combined treatment. By comparison with patients whose blood pressures fell, treatment in nonresponding patients produced even greater body weight reductions and significantly higher renin and aldosterone values. It is possible that increased activity of the renin axis, triggered by excessive volume depletion and perhaps by changes in potassium balance, were responsible for sustaining the high levels of blood pressure in those patients failing to respond to treatment."
CD009647,0,17082887,0,Toxicity and efficacy of protracted low dose temozolomide for the treatment of low grade gliomas.,"Protracted low dose temozolomide (75 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-21 of 28 days) offers potential advantages over standard temozolomide schedules (200 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 of 28 days) including greater cumulative drug exposure and depletion of O(6)-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase levels, theoretically overcoming intrinsic chemoresistance. We retrospectively review our experience in 25 patients with pathologically proven low grade gliomas (LGG) treated with protracted low dose temozolomide to primarily quantify its toxicity and secondarily to assess efficacy. None had previously received radiation. Tumor response was graded based on changes in tumor size, steroid requirements, and clinical exam. About 243 cycles of protracted low dose temozolomide were administered. Three patients (12%) were changed to standard temozolomide dosing due to side effects, including intractable nausea (n = 2) and multiple cytopenias (n = 1). The most frequent toxicities were fatigue (76%), lymphopenia (72% [48% high grade]), constipation (56%), and nausea (52%). High grade toxicities (other than lymphopenia) included secondary malignancy, pruritus, hyponatremia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and cognitive decline (n = 1 for each). Tumor response rate was 52% and and disease control rate was 84%. Six month PFS was 92% and 12 month PFS was 72%. Response rates and PFS were independent of pathological subtype, deletion status, and indication for chemotherapy. Protracted low dose temozolomide has a distinct spectrum of toxicities compared to standard dosing but is well tolerated in most patients and may provide improved response rates compared to standard dosing. The results of larger randomized trials are needed to assess its potential advantages over other management schemes."
CD009647,0,365289,0,Physiotherapy and intermittent positive-pressure ventilation of chronic bronchitis.,"Patients aged over 45 admitted to hospital with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis alone or in association with cor pulmonale, pneumonia, or respiratory failure were placed in one of three groups (men with hypoxia, men without hypoxia, and women). Patients within these groups were then randomly allocated to receive either standard drug treatment alone or standard drug treatment plus intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV). No significant differences occurred between the controls and patients receiving physiotherapy and IPPV in any group. We conclude that when a patient with chronic bronchitis and respiratory failure is deteriorating emphasis should be on correct diagnosis, fluid electrolyte balance, and nutrition together with oxygen treatment when necessary, rather than on additional physiotherapy."
CD009647,0,10622086,0,Renal function in jaundiced patients: a prospective analysis.,"A prospective analysis was undertaken to assess renal function in patients with obstructive jaundice. A total of 59 jaundiced patients (serum bilirubin > 100 mumol/l) undergoing biliary decompression by surgical, endoscopic or radiological means received prophylactic fluid volume expansion (3 litres crystalloid fluid intravenously) during the 24 hours before intervention. Renal function (urea and electrolytes, creatinine, creatinine clearance, urinary output) was assessed preoperatively and on days 1-7 and on day 28 postoperatively. Two jaundiced patients (3.4%) developed renal failure (urinary output < 400 ml in 24 hours in the presence of an increased serum urea and/or creatinine) and subsequently died. The overall incidence of post-procedural renal impairment (urinary output < 800 ml in 24 hours) was 10.2%. It is concluded that, with vigilant control of fluid and electrolyte balance and pre-procedural intravenous volume expansion, the incidence of renal dysfunction in patients with obstructive jaundice is not as high as previously reported."

CD009647,0,20396636,0,Laxative-induced rhabdomyolysis.,"The present study describes a case of laxative-induced rhabdomyolysis in an elderly patient. An 87-year-old woman was hospitalized for the onset of confusion, tremors, an inability to walk, and a fever that she had been experiencing for 36 hours. She often took high dosages of lactulose and sorbitol syrup as a laxative (about 70 g/day). During her physical examination, the patient was confused, drowsy, and she presented hyposthenia in her upper and lower limbs, symmetric and diffuse moderate hyporeflexia, and her temperature was 37.8 degrees C. Laboratory tests revealed severe hyponatremia with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis. Moreover, rhabdomyolysis markers were found. The correction of hydroelectrolytic imbalances with saline, potassium and sodium chlorure, calcium gluconate was the first treatment. During her hospitalization the patient presented acute delirium, treated with haloperidol and prometazine chloridrate intramuscularly. She was discharged 12 days later, after resolution of symptoms, and normalized laboratory tests. Over-the-counter drugs such as laxatives are usually not considered dangerous; on the other hand, they may cause serum electrolytic imbalance and rhabdomyolysis. A careful monitoring of all the drugs taken by the elderly is one of the most important duties of a physician since drug interactions and their secondary effects may be fatal."

The indication for phlebography was in all cases varicose veins with perforators. A significantly increased fibrinogen uptake was found after phlebography in 4/54 patients in the calf, suggesting development of deep venous thrombosis, which, however, could not be confirmed with plethysmography or thermography. None had clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis. The rather low incidence of post-phlebographic thrombosis compared with other series is discussed."
CD009647,0,18379556,0,Nocturnal ultrafiltration profiles in patients on APD: impact on fluid and solute transport.,"In order to prevent morbidity and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD), sodium and water balance as well as a minimal level of small-solute clearances are needed. The impact of three nocturnal peritoneal ultrafiltration (UF) profiles on UF and small solute clearance in patients on automated PD (APD) was studied: constant glucose concentration of 1.36% (flat) or modifying the glucose concentration of the heater bag (descendant: 3.86-1.36%; ascendant: 1.36-3.86%). Sixty-two patients were enrolled in the study and received each profile within a four-month period, thus serving as their own controls. UF was lower with the flat profile (367+/-420ml; P<0.01), but no difference was seen between the two higher glucose concentration profiles. Peritoneal Kt/V (pKt/V) and peritoneal creatinine clearance (CrpC) showed statistically higher values from the descendant vs ascendant vs flat profiles (pKt/V: 1.54+/-0.30 vs 1.45+/-0.30 vs 1.38+/-0.27, and CrpC: 36.9+/-7.9 vs 33.5+/-7.48 vs 29.92+/-7.5 mlmin(-1)). Multivariate analysis showed statistical significance for the following: in the intrasubject comparisons, the profile for pKt/V (F=9.109, P<0.001) and CrpC (F=11.697, P<0.001), and in the intersubjects comparisons, the effects of both gender (F=14.334, P<0.01) for pKt/V and peritoneal permeability for both parameters (pKt/V: F=4.37, P<0.05; CrpC: F=11.697, P<0.001). In conclusion, the application of ascendant and descendant UF profiles in automated PD is feasible and results in better UF and small solute clearances, thus preventing inadequate dialysis and volume overload.."

CD009647,0,12059010,0,"Continuous monitoring of plasma, interstitial, and intracellular fluid volumes in dialyzed patients by bioimpedance and hematocrit measurements.","Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) permits evaluation of extra- and intracellular fluid volumes in patients. We wished to examine whether this technique, used in combination with hematocrit measurement, can reliably monitor fluid transfers during dialysis. Ankle to wrist BIS measurements were collected during 21 dialysis runs while hematocrit was continuously monitored in the blood line by an optical device. Extracellular (ECW) and intracellular (ICW) water volumes were calculated using Hanai's electrical model of suspensions. Plasma volume variations were calculated from hematocrit, and changes in interstitial volume were calculated as the difference between ECW and plasma volume changes. Because accuracy of ICW was too low, changes in ICW were calculated as the difference between ultrafiltered volume and ECW changes. Total body water (TBW) volumes calculated pre- and postdialysis were, respectively, 3.25+/-3.2 and 1.95+/-2.5 liters lower on average than TBW given by Watson et al.'s correlation. Average decreases in fluid compartments expressed as percentage of ultrafiltered volume were as follows: plasma, 18%; interstitial, 28%, and ICW, 54%. When the ultrafiltered volume was increased in a patient in successive runs, the relative contributions of ICW and interstitial fluid were augmented so as to reduce the relative drop in plasma volume."
CD009647,0,1656676,0,Benefit of intravenous essential amino-acids in catabolic patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis.,"The effect on the clinical status of catabolic hemodialysis patients of I.V. essential amino-acids administered over 3 months at the end of each dialysis is assessed in an open clinical follow-up study of 10 patients; these patients showed a progressive deterioration of general condition and a progressive weight loss in the period before the start of the treatment. The study was undertaken in a hospital dialysis unit, with as main outcome measures body weight, hematocrit, a scoring index of general condition and degree of edema. In patients showing a progressive and consistent loss of body weight in the months preceding the study, after the first treatment month, body weight started to rise, increasing after 3 months from 56.2 +/- 2.3 to 58.6 +/- 2.4 kg (p less than 0.01). The hematocrit raised from 22.4 +/- 1.6% up to 26.5 +/- 1.9% (p less than 0.02). Over this period, only 2 liters of packed cells were administered, in contrast to an overall need of 13 liters in the preceding 6 months. Peripheral and/or pulmonary edema disappeared. A scoring index, of general condition, increased from 5.1 +/- 1.5 before the start of the study to 11.7 +/- 0.8 after 3 months (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that the parenteral administration of amino-acids in catabolic patients on chronic hemodialysis has a beneficial effect on general condition, and the balance of body fluid and body mass."

A 71-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed as hypertension and multiple cerebral infarction, was given sulpiride 150 mg daily for depressive state. Three days after started sulpiride, she developed fever, sweating, difficulty of movement and was admitted to the hospital. The white blood cell count rose to 16,300/mm3 and serum creatine kinase (CK) to 3,063 IU/L. Two days later CK rose to 20,050 IU/L regardless of stopping the drug, so she was transferred to our hospital for further investigation. On admission, it was the 6th day from the onset, she was mute and akinetic accompanied by muscle pain and rigidity in extremities. Serum CK was 1,831 IU/L, Na 122 mEq/L, osmolality 244 mOsm/kg, plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) level 6.5 pg/ml and urine Na was 101 mEq/L, osmolality 467 mOsm/kg. Renal and adrenal functions, plasma renin activity were normal. From the history, course and these data, diagnosis of NMS associated with SIADH was made. Intravenous sodium (130-200 mEq/day) and fluids (1,000-1,200 ml/day) were carefully infused. She became active, muscle pain disappeared and rigidity, akinesia decreased. CK, serum Na and osmolality gradually improved to normal. About the transient increase in ADH secretion, we considered that hypothalamic disturbance in NMS might induce leakage of stored ADH from neuroendocrine neurons in it."
CD009647,0,7894218,0,Ectopic ACTH secretion due to a bronchopulmonary carcinoid localized by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy.,"We present the case of a 65-year-old woman with an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secreting bronchopulmonary carcinoid. This patient showed the typical long history of Cushing's syndrome, including hypokaliemia, impaired glucose tolerance, high levels of ACTH and beta-endorphin, and coproduction of other peptides. At the onset of clinical symptoms in 1979 an adrenal adenoma was suspected, and left-sided adrenalectomy was performed. The symptoms soon recurred, and the diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome was made. As no ACTH-secreting tumor was found, the right adrenal was resected, and the patient was followed up regularly. Fourteen years later chest roentgenography and computed tomography revealed a para-aortic pulmonary lesion, which was suspicious for a bronchopulmonary carcinoid. ACTH and beta-endorphin were excessively, pancreatic polypeptide slightly elevated at that time. The final diagnosis was made using somatostatin receptor scintigraphy which confirmed the hormonal activity of the suspicious lesion; no additional focus was found. This method turned out to be not only a useful additional localization technique but also a promising tool for characterization and staging of a suspected ACTH-producing carcinoid. The tumor was resected curatively, and the diagnosis was confirmed histologically."
CD009647,0,10205310,0,Body-water compartments measured by bio-electrical impedance spectroscopy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"It was previously demonstrated that single frequency bio-electrical impedance (BIA) measurement at 50 kHz is a useful method to assess total body water (TBW) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the present study it was examined whether bio-electrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) could predict extracellular water (ECW) and improve the prediction of TBW in these patients. TBW and ECW (corrected bromide space) were measured by deuterium and bromide dilution. In 37 COPD patients prediction equations were obtained using BIS (5-500 kHz) measurements, and these were cross validated in a second group of 40 COPD patients. All patients were in a clinically stable condition. TBW predicted by BIS was not significantly different from actual TBW and demonstrated a comparable standard error of estimate (SEE) as found previously in healthy subjects (male symbol correlation coefficient: r = 0.88, SEE: 2.3 L, female symbol r = 0.85, SEE: 2.9 L). Predicted ECW using BIS-measurements was not significantly different from measured ECW (male symbol r = 0.75, SEE: 1.4 L, female symbol r = 0.73, SEE: 1.2 L), but the error in the prediction was relatively large and the correlation between predicted and actual ECW relatively low compared to most studies in healthy subjects. Predicted TBW using BIS was comparable to actual TBW, but presented no improvement of the prediction of TBW using BIA at 50 kHz and a patient specific regression equation. The error of the prediction of ECW by BIS limits the ability to predict fluid shifts in individual patients with clinically stable COPD."

Relatively recent substitution of isotonic irrigation solutions has transformed the predominant laboratory abnormality reported from one of hypotonic hyponatremia to one of nearly isotonic hyponatremia with infrequent clinically significant manifestations. We report the unique association of acute and very severe isotonic hyponatremia with rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure in the post-TURP setting. The mechanism for rhabdomyolysis is postulated to be an impairment of normal maintenance of cellular integrity by virtue of the acuteness and severity of hyponatremia, in the absence of a disturbance of tonicity. Survival after hyponatremia of this severity has not, to our knowledge, been previously reported."

It is mostly seen in children, and there are very few reports in adults. We present a 67-year-old patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presented with weight loss of 40 pounds, severe diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia and hypokalemia. The patient was immunosuppressed with hypogammaglobulinemia, which is common in CLL. Thus, the patient had negative serological studies for celiac disease. An endoscopic evaluation and HLA typing supported the diagnosis of celiac disease. Although the differential diagnosis was broad, exclusion of other etiologies for diarrhea, prompt diagnosis of celiac disease and initiation of gluten-free diet resolved the crisis. This is the first such report of a patient presenting with celiac crisis on a background of hypogammaglobulinemia."

CD009647,0,2364713,0,Postoperative fluid overload: not a benign problem.,"The incidence and consequences of fluid overload in the surgical ICU (SICU) have not been well defined, but may influence length of stay, days requiring mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Forty-eight consecutive patients admitted to our SICU were prospectively monitored for acute changes in weight and its impact on clinical management and outcome. When defined as a gain greater than 10% from their preoperative or premorbid weight (or an approximately 20% increase in total body water), 40% of patients had fluid overload. Patients were divided into three groups: those who had gained less than or equal to 10%, those with a weight gain between 11% and 20%, and those with greater than 20% increase in weight. Significant differences were found with respect to vasopressor dependence, colloid administration, and mortality. When indexed by initial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) mortality prediction scores, all groups had similar degrees of illness. On average, presumably due to volume limitations, patients were inadequately nourished during 85% of their SICU stay. Our results suggest that the morbidity of fluid overload can be significant, and warrants a fresh look at the methods of intraoperative fluid resuscitation."
CD009647,0,111998,0,Effect of an elemental diet on body composition. A comparison with intravenous nutrition.,"Measurements of changes in body fat, protein, and water were carried out on two comparable groups of 14 ill surgical patients each over 2-wk period during which one group received an elemental diet (nonprotein energy source was 67% carbohydrate and 33% fat) and the other a course of intravenous nutrition (nonprotein energy source was 100% carbohydrate). The patients fed with the elemental diet had no significant changes in body weight, fat, protein, water, or plasma proteins over the study period, and although the patients fed intravenously also had no changes in body protein or plasma proteins, there was an average gain of 3.2 kg of body weight. This weight gain was mainly extracellular water. It is concluded that the administration of the elemental diet by continuous infusion was comparable to intravenous nutrition in maintaining body protein in these very ill patients and had the advantage of being cheaper and easier to manage. The problem of extracellular water accumulation seen in the patients fed intravenously was not present in the patients who received the elemental diet."

CD009647,0,16716240,0,Prognostic relevance of anamnestic and diagnostic parameters in low-frequency hearing impairment.,"Low-frequency hearing impairment (LFHI) is mainly attributed to endolymphatic hydrops and has a great variety of possible outcomes. At present, no conservative therapeutic regimen has proven to be 'gold-standard', and information about the prognostic indicators of LFHI is scarce. In a retrospective investigation, we evaluated the records of 90 patients who had been treated with infusions improving blood perfusion. In patients lacking complete remission, dehydration infusion therapy was added. We also undertook audiometric follow up. We calculated the outcomes after infusion therapy, dehydration therapy and after long-time hearing follow up, and we determined the prognostic relevance of several parameters of anamnesis and clinical examination to outcomes, for both therapeutic interventions and long-time hearing. The prognosis of LFHI was significantly correlated to certain anamnestic and clinical parameters; a short duration of the disease, lack of vertigo and female gender implied a better outcome. The pretherapeutic hearing threshold was an important prognostic factor; the outcome was significantly worse in patients with distinct hearing impairment in low or high frequencies, compared with that in patients with little hearing loss. Whereas vertigo was a negative prognostic factor, the results of quantitative vestibular testing were irrelevant to the outcome. The glycerol test failed to predict the effectiveness of dehydration therapy and lacked any value in predicting prognosis. These results allow the clinician to focus the anamnesis and diagnostic examination on prognostically relevant parameters, thus enabling a better estimation of the long-term disease course and improved counselling of patients. Furthermore, these results help to distinguish valuable from irrelevant diagnostic procedures."
CD009647,0,9440092,0,D-thyroxine reduces lipoprotein(a) serum concentration in dialysis patients.,"Uremia raises lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) serum concentration and the risk of arteriosclerosis in dialysis patients. The treatment of high Lp(a) levels is not satisfactory today. The decrease of Lp(a) in hypothyroid patients on L-T4 therapy raised the question of whether dextro-thyroxine (D-thyroxine) reduces not only serum cholesterol, but also Lp(a) serum concentration. In a single-blind placebo-controlled study, the influence of D-thyroxine therapy on Lp(a) serum concentration was evaluated in 30 hemodialysis patients with elevated Lp(a) serum levels. Lp(a) was quantified in parallel by two methods, i.e., rocket immunoelectrophoresis and nephelometry, and apo(a) isoforms were determined by a sensitive immunoblotting technique. Regardless of the apo(a) isoforms, 6 mg/d D-thyroxine reduced elevated Lp(a) levels significantly by 27 +/- 13% in 20 dialysis patients (P < 0.001) compared with 10 control subjects (-9.9 +/- 8.4%). In parallel, D-thyroxine therapy significantly lowered total cholesterol (P < 0.001), LDL cholesterol (P < 0.001), and LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio (P < 0.01); raised T4 and T3 serum levels; and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion without causing clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism in any of the patients. D-Thyroxine reduces elevated serum Lp(a) concentration in dialysis patients. The effect in nondialysis patients can be expected but remains to be proven."
CD009647,0,9623431,0,Benefits of intraoperative skin surface warming in cardiac surgical patients.,"We have investigated patients undergoing cardiac surgery with hypothermic bypass to see if the addition of skin surface warming during systemic rewarming on bypass (heated group, n = 43) would improve perioperative thermal balance compared with conventional management without skin warming (control group, n = 43) in an open, randomized, controlled study. Intraoperative skin warming with a water mattress and forced warm air over the face, neck and shoulders attenuated the afterdrop in nasopharyngeal temperature after weaning from bypass (2.3 (1.2) degrees C and 1.3 (0.5) degrees C in the control and heated groups, respectively) (P < 0.05) and resulted in higher rectal temperature 4 h after surgery. Despite similar standard coagulation tests, heated patients had lower blood loss via the chest tubes (600 (264) ml vs 956 (448) ml in control patients) (P < 0.05) and less requirements for i.v. colloid infusion (1662 (404) ml vs 1994 (389) ml) (P < 0.05). There was a significant inverse correlation between rectal temperature on arrival in the ICU and postoperative blood loss (r = 0.57, P < 0.001). These data suggest that additional skin surface warming with a water mattress and forced warm air helped to preserve perioperative thermal balance and may contribute to reduced bleeding after cardiac surgery."
CD009647,0,12092044,0,Whipple's disease: a granulomatous masquerader.,"Whipple's disease is a multisystemic infection that affects middle-aged white men. It typically presents with fever, polyarthritis, diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss. Many other systems can be involved, however, including the central nervous system, heart, lymphatics, lungs, bone marrow, and skin. Recent work has demonstrated the causative organism to be a complex bacteria, Tropheryma whipplei. The diagnosis is established most securely by periodic acid-Schiff staining of foamy monocyte-macrophages in biopsy tissue and body fluids, by electron microscopy, which reveals bacilli within membrane-bound vesicles, and by molecular amplification techniques using polymerase chain reaction of tissues and body fluids. The differential diagnosis includes chronic multisystemic infections and granulomatous disorders, because Whipple's disease is a fascinating blend of both. The condition can resemble sarcoidosis and mycobacterial disease and fungal, protozoal, and bacillary infections. Earlier diagnosis leads to earlier treatment and hopefully the prevention of chronic disabling complications and needless mortality from this once uniformly fatal condition."

CD009647,0,2009244,0,Neuroendocrine mechanisms and cardiovascular homeostasis in the elderly.,"Reduced homeostatic capacity is typical of the aging process and is particularly apparent in changes in the neuroendocrine control of cardiovascular homeostasis. Not only is there reduced beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness, but reduced baroreflex function also occurs with age. These result in increased sensitivity to the therapeutic and postural hypotensive effects of diuretics and vasodilators. Increased total body sodium and reduced activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may also contribute to the therapeutic effect of diuretics and salt restriction in elderly hypertensives. In addition, atrial natriuretic peptide levels are increased in the elderly and may in part be responsible for the suppressed renin and aldosterone levels found in older groups. Vasopressin secretion and thirst are also disturbed with age, and may act in concert with declining renal function to predispose the elderly to disturbances of water balance. An understanding of these neuroendocrine changes with age is important to maximize therapeutic benefit and to minimize adverse effects in the treatment of hypertension in the elderly."

CD009647,0,17413560,0,Comparison of progressive conductivity reduction with diacontrol and standard dialysis.,"We examined whether progressive reduction of dialysate sodium with Diacontrol (DC, plasma conductivity targeted feedback system) confers any clinical benefit over a similar strategy using dialysis with fixed dialysate conductivity (HD). Ten stable patients entered a randomized crossover study conducted over 360 dialysis sessions. Sodium balance, blood pressure (BP), intradialytic hypotension rates (IDH), thirst score, and extracellular water (ECW) were recorded. Interdialytic ambulatory BP was measured at the highest and lowest conductivities. BP, interdialytic weight gains and thirst scores were low at the outset and were not altered significantly by conductivity reduction. The lowest fixed dialysate setting of 13.2 mS/cm resulted in greater sodium depuration than the lowest conductivity setting allowable with DC, as reflected by lower post dialysis plasma conductivity (13.4 +/- 0.14 mS/cm versus 13.5 +/- 0.04 mS/cm, p < 0.001). Predialysis ECW fell from 0.22 +/- 0.04 l/kg to 0.21 +/- 0.09 l/kg as conductivity reduced with HD (p < 0.05), but did not change significantly with DC. When HD and DC were matched for end-dialysis plasma conductivity, there were no differences in BP, IDH frequency, or dialysis tolerability even at the lowest conductivity settings. In a setting of dialysate sodium reduction, DC did not appear to have any short-term clinical advantage over standard dialysis, and its range is limited at the lower conductivity settings."

CD009647,0,7651453,0,Beneficial effect of intranasal desmopressin for nocturnal polyuria in Parkinson's disease.,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are known to experience autonomic nervous system dysfunction: this disruptive symptomatology includes urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturnal polyuria. Anticholinergic and tricyclic medications can be beneficial in controlling these urinary symptoms, but have unpleasant side effects in some patients. Desmopressin has been used to treat nocturnal polyuria successfully in a number of conditions, such as central diabetes insipidus, enuresis, and autonomic failure. The purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy of desmopressin in patients with PD with significant nocturia. Eight patients were recruited into the study. They were first asked to establish a baseline of number of nocturnal voids; the patients were then prescribed the intranasal form of desmopressin and asked to continue to record the number of nocturnal voids. The five patients who completed the trial demonstrated clinically and statistically significant reductions in the frequency of nocturnal voids. One patient became hyponatremic and confused during desmopressin administration; his symptoms resolved soon after the desmopressin was discontinued. Two patients failed to complete the trial due to compliance problems. Thus, desmopressin appears to be a safe and effective medication for nocturnal polyuria in PD."

It is based on a calculation of the patient's preoperative total haemoglobin content, from which losses are subtracted. The haemoglobin concentration of the blood is used as an indicator of dilution. The HDM was compared to the 131I-RISA technique in 10 patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR). The difference between the HDM and RISA in estimating the total operative procedure blood volume change was 0.03 +/- 0.12 l (ns) with a linearity of 0.90. The blood volume changes were also predicted by a fluid balance formula. With RISA as reference, the formula had a lower precision (0.24 l) and a poorer linearity (0.65) than the HDM. The HDM did not lose in accuracy if repeated several times during the TURs or if a theoretical formula for estimation of the preoperative blood volume was used."

SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND CLINICAL COURSE: Initially the patients show the presence of a secretory diarrhea, existing over several years, which can be compensated by increased oral fluid intake and renal mechanisms. Often the chronic course is not given adequate notice by patient and consulting physician alike. By an increase of the mucous volume together with an exhaustion of the physiological compensation mechanisms a life-threatening condition with severe electrolyte and fluid loss as well as acute prerenal failure develops, which can lead to difficulties in the diagnosis finding. Therefore, especially in case of a triade of prerenal failure, electrolyte disorder and chronic diarrhea, the existence of an intestinal villous adenoma should be considered."

CD009647,0,21449910,0,Salicin regulates the expression of functional 'youth gene clusters' to reflect a more youthful gene expression profile.,"There are a variety of biological mechanisms that contribute to specific characteristics of ageing skin; for example, the loss of skin structure proteins, increased susceptibility to UV-induced pigmentation and/or loss of hydration. Each of these biological processes is influenced by specific groups of genes. In this research, we have identified groups of genes associated with specific clinical signs of skin ageing and refer to these as functional 'youth gene clusters'. In this study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to investigate the effects of topical application of salicin in regulating the expression of functional 'youth gene clusters' to reflect a more youthful skin profile and reduce the appearance of attributes associated with skin ageing. Results showed that salicin significantly influences the gene expression profiles of treated human equivalent full-thickness skin, by regulating the expression of genes associated with various biological processes involving skin structure, skin hydration, pigmentation and cellular differentiation. Based on the findings from this experiment, salicin was identified as a key ingredient that may regulate functional 'youth gene clusters' to reflect a more youthful gene expression profile by increasing the expression of genes responsible for youthful skin and decreasing the expression of genes responsible for the appearance of aged skin."

Treatment of consequent hypovolemia is a challenge. The aim of study was to assess if glutathione pro-drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can influence inflammation and fluid requirement. We also aimed to compare organ functions scores and vasoactive drug requirement. This prospective randomised study involved 28 patients with burn injury affecting more than 20% of body surface area. Fourteen patients were on standard therapy, whereas for other 14 patients NAC was supplemented. Blood samples were taken on admission and on the next five consecutive mornings. Leukocyte surface marker expressions were determined, multiple organ function scores, use of vasopressor agents and fluid requirements were recorded daily. Expression of CD11a (p < 0.05), CD18 (p < 0.05) and CD97 (p < 0.01) on the granulocytes were significantly lower in the NAC treated group, similarly to lymphocyte CD 49d (p < 0.05) and monocyte CD 49d (p < 0.01) and CD 97 (p < 0.05) expression. No significant difference was found in the fluid requirement between groups but patients the NAC group required less vasopressor and inotropic drugs from day 4.

CD009647,0,21510854,0,A practical guide to bioelectrical impedance analysis using the example of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a simple, inexpensive, quick and non-invasive technique for measuring body composition. The clinical benefit of BIA can be further enhanced by combining it with bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA). However, there is a substantial lack of information on the practical aspects of BIA/BIVA for those primarily interested in learning how to use and interpret this method in practice. The purpose of this article is to provide some guidance on the use of BIA/BIVA with special attention to practical considerations.This report reflects the authors' practical experience with the use of single-frequency BIA in combination with BIVA, particularly in COPD patients. First, the method and principles of BIA/BIVA are briefly described. Then, a practice-oriented approach to the interpretation and analysis of characteristic examples of altered nutritional and fluid status as seen with BIA/BIVA in COPD patients (e.g. malnutrition in obese and underweight patients with COPD, water retention) is presented.As our examples show BIA/BIVA is an attractive and easy-to-learn tool for quick nutritional assessment and is therefore of great clinical benefit in daily practice."
CD009647,0,8489342,0,Concurrent isolation of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis from multiple blood cultures in a patient with acute leukemia.,"Reports of the concurrent isolation of more than one non-albicans species of Candida from blood cultures of immunocompromised patients with disseminated candidiasis are extremely infrequent. We report on the isolation of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis from 17 blood cultures that were taken from a 67-year-old white man with a diagnosis of acute biphenotypic leukemia during a 2-week period of hospitalization for induction chemotherapy. Despite receiving high-dose amphotericin B throughout this period, the status of the patient worsened, and he experienced pancytopenia, hypernatremia, azotemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which led to his death. Candida krusei and C tropicalis were isolated concurrently from 10 of the 17 blood cultures, while C krusei was the single isolate in three cultures and C tropicalis was isolated alone in four cultures. Each species manifested markedly different colonial morphological features. This case report serves to emphasize to microbiologists that they must exercise extreme suspicion when non-albicans species of Candida are isolated singly or concurrently from blood cultures in neutropenic patients, given the increasing clinical significance of these yeasts."

CD009647,0,12753429,0,Pharmacokinetics and antidiuretic effect of high-dose desmopressin in patients with chronic renal failure.,"High-dose desmopressin shortens the bleeding time in uraemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and the antidiuretic effect of desmopressin when given in a dose normally used for haemostasis to patients with reduced renal function. Ten patients with chronic renal failure of varying aetiology were enrolled in the study. The age was 58 (20-76) years (median and range), serum creatinine 447 (309-691) micromol/l and plasma clearance of iohexol 16 (8-19) ml/min./1.73 m2 body surface. After baseline measurements, desmopressin was infused at a dose of 0.3 microg/kg. The plasma concentration of desmopressin was followed for 26 hr during and after the infusion and the pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by compartmental analysis. Urine volume and osmolality, as well as body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, haematocrit, serum osmolality, electrolytes and creatinine, were measured repeatedly during the day before and for two days after the infusion. The total clearance of desmopressin was 0.35 (0.21-0.47) ml/min./kg, the volume of distribution at steady state was 0.30 (0.17-0.38) l/kg and the terminal half-life 9.7 (8.4-16) hr. After administration of desmopressin, urine osmolality increased significantly, by approximately 10%, and this increase lasted for 48 hr. Concomitantly, there was a modest but significant decrease in haematocrit. Thus, the clearance of desmopressin was on average decreased to approximately one quarter, and the terminal half-life was prolonged 2-3 times in the patients as compared to previously published values for healthy adults. The single haemostatic dose of desmopressin given to patients with severe renal failure did not cause fluid overload or changes in serum electrolytes."
CD009647,0,3341836,0,High-dose furosemide in the treatment of refractory congestive heart failure.,"Thirty-five patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure that was refractory to conventional therapy were given high dosages of furosemide (250 to 4000 mg/d) because of significantly reduced renal function (mean endogenous creatinine clearance, 0.53 mL/s/1.73 m2 [32 mL/min/1.73 m2]). Natriuresis, weight reduction (mean, 11 kg), and relief of symptoms were achieved in all patients. The mean survival after the start of the high-dose furosemide therapy was 11.3 months (range, 0.5 to 36 months) (n = 35). When this therapy eventually failed, long-term intermittent hemofiltration was performed in eight selected cases, further prolonging survival (mean, 3.0 months). High-dose furosemide therapy and hemofiltration improved the quality of life and prolonged survival. The use of diuretics in congestive heart failure should therefore include treatment with high-dose furosemide, which is effective and can be given over a long period without serious side effects."

CD009647,0,9458998,1,Response to dehydration in elderly patients in long-term care.,"Elderly patients in long-term care have a high plasma osmolality (pOSM) and associated increased mortality. In these patients, we examined pOSM, thirst (visual analogue scale, VAS) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) response to 16-hour dehydration and 2-hour rehydration. Twelve patients were randomly divided into two groups (A & B). Group A had their fluid balance monitored for two weeks, group B did not. Single measurements of VAS, pOSM and AVP were conducted on days 0, 7 and 13. Dehydration tests were conducted in both groups at the start of the study (DAY 1), and at the end of the two-week period (DAY 14). There were no significant differences between group A and B, so the results are presented for the two groups combined. There was a significant increase in both pOSM and VAS during dehydration, and a significant fall in both variables during rehydration [F (9,99) = 18.69, p < 0.001, and F(9,99) = 11.25, p < 0.001, respectively]. Plasma AVP did not change significantly during either dehydration or rehydration [F (9,99) = 0.59, p = 0.8]. There were no significant differences in response for any of the three variables between DAY 1 and DAY 14. We conclude that elderly patients in long-term care exhibit changes in thirst and osmolality during dehydration and rehydration, and that these responses are reproducible. The lack of a significant AVP response requires further investigation."
CD009647,0,6532797,0,A case of hypokalemic myopathy associated with transient hypothyroidism.,"A case of transient hypothyroidism in the course of hypokalemic myopathy is reported. A 69-year-old woman had severe muscle weakness and marked potassium deficiency associated with alkalosis during treatment with thiazide diuretics. The cause of muscle weakness proved to be hypokalemic myopathy confirmed by clinical findings and muscle biopsy. After the episode of hypokalemic myopathy, serum levels of thyroid hormone were lowered (T4; 3.8 micrograms/dl, T3; 54 ng/dl) and that of TSH was elevated (25.1 microU/ml). Antithyroid microsomal antibody was positive (1:25600) and anti-thyroglobulin antibody was negative. About one month after potassium supplement, her thyroid functions returned to normal, along with normalization of serum potassium level. This is the first documented case report of hypokalemic myopathy accompanied by transient hypothyroidism in a patient with autoimmune thyroiditis. We suggest that this transient hypothyroidism might be induced by hypokalemia during the course of autoimmune thyroiditis."

The peak O(2) uptake of 10 SED (67.1 +/- 1.4 yr) and 9 ACT (68.0 +/- 1.1 yr) volunteers was determined by a graded cycling exercise test (22.1 +/- 1.2 vs 35.8 +/- 1.3 ml.min(-1).kg(-1), P < 0.01). Baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP; tonometry) and middle cerebral arterial blood flow velocity (V(MCA); transcranial Doppler) were similar between the groups (SED vs. ACT group: 91 +/- 3 vs. 87 +/- 3 mmHg and 54.9 +/- 2.3 vs. 57.8 +/- 3.2 cm/s, respectively), whereas heart rate was higher and stroke volume (bioimpedance) was smaller in the SED group than in the ACT group. Central hypovolemia during graded lower body negative pressure (LBNP) was larger (P < 0.01) in the ACT group than in the SED group. However, the slope of V(MCA)/LBNP was smaller (P < 0.05) in the ACT group (0.159 +/- 0.016 cm/s/Torr) than in the SED group (0.211 +/- 0.008 cm/s/Torr). During LBNP, the SED group had a greater augmentation of cerebral vasomotor tone (P < 0.05) and hypocapnia (P < 0.001) compared with the ACT group. Baseline MAP variability and V(MCA) variability were significantly smaller in the SED group than in the ACT group, i.e., 0.49 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.16 (mmHg)(2) and 1.06 +/- 0.19 vs. 4.24 +/- 1.59 (cm/s)(2), respectively. However, transfer function gain, coherence, and phase between MAP and V(MCA) signals (Welch spectral estimator) from 0.08-0.18 Hz were not different between SED (1.41 +/- 0.18 cm.s(-1).mmHg(-1), 0.63 +/- 0.06 units, and 38.03 +/- 6.57 degrees ) and ACT (1.65 +/- 0.44 cm.s(-1).mmHg(-1), 0.56 +/- 0.05 units, and 48.55 +/- 11.84 degrees ) groups. We conclude that a physically active lifestyle improves the intrinsic mechanism of cerebral autoregulation and helps mitigate cerebral hypoperfusion during central hypovolemia in healthy elderly adults."

Extracellular water volume was also reduced in patients with jaundice (20.3 versus 24.3 per cent, P less than 0.003) owing to a reduction of the interstitial space (16.1 versus 19.5 per cent, P less than 0.004) and, to a lesser degree, of the plasma volume (4.2 versus 4.8 per cent, P = 0.1). There was a close correlation in jaundiced patients between plasma volume and the creatinine clearance rate (r2 = 0.56, P less than 0.02) and between plasma volume and extracellular volume (r2 = 0.77, P less than 0.0001). Extracellular volume in such patients also correlated with the percentage weight loss (r2 = 0.42, P = 0.04). Obstructive jaundice is associated with a contracted extracellular water compartment, although extracellular water, as a percentage of body-weight, increased in proportion to the body-weight lost. Reduction of the interstitial volume and a marginally reduced plasma volume may be determinant factors in the pathogenesis of the renal and haemodynamic disturbances observed in patients with biliary tract obstruction."
CD009647,0,10439344,0,Wet decontamination-induced stratum corneum hydration--effects on the skin barrier function to diethylmalonate.,"Decontamination of chemical agents from the skin uses both dry and wet decontamination processes. Recent studies have shown that wet decontamination frequently results in stratum corneum hydration. To evaluate the hydration effect of wet decontamination on the skin barrier function and hence on the decontamination efficiency, a series of comparative studies were carried out on human skin contaminated with the nerve agent simulant diethylmalonate, using decontamination media having different salinity and surfactants. The results showed that, compared to non-decontaminated skin, remnant diethylmalonate on decontaminated skin penetrated at an accelerated rate in the immediate 2 h following decontamination. This transient enhancement effect, ranging from 20 to 98%, was depended on the nature of the decontamination media used and was more obvious in skin samples that were decontaminated 1 h postexposure. All decontamination media exhibited this effect, with the greatest enhancement observed in the following order: anionic surfactant > cationic surfactant > non-ionic surfactant > deionized water > 0.9% saline > 9% saline."
CD009647,0,11774114,0,Bipedal bioelectrical impedance analysis reproducibly estimates total body water in hemodialysis patients.,"Formal kinetic modeling for hemodialysis patients requires accurate determination of in vivo dialyzer clearance, careful measurement of the actual dialysis time, and calculation of the patient's total body water (V) or urea space. Bipedal (BP) bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a simple method for the determination of V at the same time the patient is weighed. Because of better correlation with the Watson formula volume and a smaller coefficient of variation than urea kinetic volumes, BP-BIA estimates of V may be preferred in dialysis units that meet guidelines by following formal kinetic modeling data or use V estimates in calculating treatment time."

With fewer TURPs being performed, proficiency in this basic urologic technique has decreased, causing longer resection times. This often leads to a higher risk of fluid absorption, water toxicity, and hyponatremia (TUR syndrome). We examined the safety of bipolar electrocautery TURP (saline TURP) with the Gyrus PlasmaKinetic system using normal saline as irrigant."

CD009647,0,9615808,0,Hydration regimen and hematological toxicity of a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen. Clinical observations and pharmacokinetic analysis.,"The administration of 100 mg/m2 Cisplatin (CDDP) in five 20 mg/m2 daily infusions together with bolus 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) allows patients with advanced head and neck cancer (HNC) to be treated with a rapidly alternating chemoradiotherapy regimen in an out-patient setting. Due to the extremely low rate of acute renal failure, the induction of forced diuresis is not mandatory, although hydration is usually performed at every CDDP administration. In this retrospective analysis of 73 homogenously treated HNC patients, the influence of hydration on hematological toxicity was studied. A lower incidence of grade II to IV acute myelosuppression (57% vs 92%; p < 0.005), together with a lower rate of anemia lasting two weeks or more (13% vs 46%; p < 0.009), were seen in the group of patients treated with CDDP along with a forced hydration scheme (2000 ml normal saline and 20 mg furosemide before the CDDP infusion) when compared to patients on a non-forced diuresis regimen (no furosemide and 1500 ml normal saline). The lower hematological toxicity translated into a better compliance to treatment. No differences in terms of other toxicities or response rate were evident between the two groups. A pharmacokinetic study with a cross over design was performed on 7 patients, and suggests that the first day Pt kinetics are not affected by the hydration scheme used, although a significantly lower Pt urinary concentration was found in the forced diuresis group. A further kinetic analysis performed on one additional patient over the entire five-day period of two consecutive cycles showed a marked increase in the AUC of filterable Pt and in the unbound Pt fraction (fu) from the second to the fifth day in the forced hydration course, while this was not the case in the non-forced hydration course. Results from this kinetic study support the hypothesis of a lowering of Pt reactive species after repeated CDDP-furosemide treatments and an influence of furosemide-induced diuresis on Pt binding to plasma proteins."
CD009647,0,2129453,0,On-line bioelectric impedance during haemodialysis: monitoring of body fluids and cell membrane status.,"We have measured by a computed integrated system (BIA 109, RJL AKERN) the changes of bio-impedance (BI) deriving from a tetrapolar system working on 800 microA, 50 kHz current, in 23 haemodialysed patients. Resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) have been continuously monitored during haemodialysis in each patient. Resistance was strictly inversely correlated to the decrease of body weight (r = 0.82). Also, Xc increased almost constantly. In most of the patients the increase of Xc was proportionally greater than R, resulting in an increase of phase angle (PA). However, Xc showed a transient decrease in response to seven severe symptomatic hypotensive episodes, whereas R maintained the increasing trend, causing a sharp reduction of phase angle. As Xc is an expression of storage of electrical charge by the cells acting as condensers, and phase angle quantifies the active capacitive component in relation to passive electrical resistance, these parameters may be important to evaluate cell membrane function. In fact, the univocal increase of R, Xc and phase angle observed during normal unevenful haemodialysis probably indicates improvement of cellular activities due to the depurative treatment. On the contrary, the transient reduction of Xc and phase angle observed during hypotensive crises may be an expression of cellular distress because of a too rapid ultrafiltration."

CD009647,0,9504354,0,Double-blind crossover study of the interaction between perindopril and amlodipine on blood pressure and hormones related to fluid and electrolyte balance in patients with essential hypertension.,"This study was to investigate the interaction between low doses of perindopril (2 mg daily) and amlodipine (2.5 mg daily) on ambulatory blood pressure (BP), clinic BP, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), plasma levels of renin (PRA), angiotensin II (Ang II), aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-h ANP) in subjects with essential hypertension. The study design was a parallel, two-period, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover design, with 11 subjects receiving perindopril and 10 receiving amlodipine during the run-in phase. The addition of amlodipine to perindopril had no effect on ambulatory BP, whereas the addition of perindopril to amlodipine reduced both systolic (P = 0.027) and diastolic (P = 0.049) ambulatory BP. By contrast, the opposite result was obtained for clinic BP at trough, whereby the addition of amlodipine to perindopril reduced erect systolic BP (P = 0.036) and both supine and erect diastolic BP (P = 0.038) whereas the addition of perindopril to amlodipine was without effect. The addition of perindopril to amlodipine decreased serum ACE by 72% and increased PRA two-fold, without change in plasma levels of Ang II, aldosterone or alpha-h ANP. The addition of amlodipine to perindopril increased plasma aldosterone 1.7-fold but did not affect serum ACE, PRA, Ang II, or alpha-h ANP. These interactions between perindopril and amlodipine may have been conditioned by the specific effects of the therapy first given, as well as by the different circumstances of BP measurement (ambulatory vs clinic)."

Circulating blood volume (BV) was measured to study in the perioperative period. Three coronary artery bypasses were made under cardiopulmonary bypass, being managed by ultrafiltration when the pump-oxygenator was in action and by peritoneal dialysis in the early postoperative period. Preoperative BV reduced immediately after the operation. It showed an increasing trend 4 hours after the operation, but after that BV reduced from that before the operation while water balance was kept positive. Cardiac output after the operation was higher than before. It suggested that in this patient using hemodialysis BV levels turned to be lower compared with that before the operation, as excessive water leaked out of the blood vessel, although water balance was kept positive due to improved cardiac functions after the operation."

CD009647,0,8164338,0,Effects of long-term infusion of synthetic atrial natriuretic factor on hemodynamics and water input-output balance in patients with acute myocardial infarction.,"The administration of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) increases coronary blood flow and decreases coronary vascular resistance. However, little is known about the feasibility and reliability of intravenous long-term infusion of ANF in patients with coronary heart disease. We therefore examined the effects on hemodynamic parameters and water input-output balance of 24-hour administration of synthetic ANF (ANF-[99-126]: 20-50 ng/kg/min) in 8 patients with acute myocardial infarction (6 men and 2 women; mean age 55 years). The ANF infusion significantly decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to a maximum of greater than 50% 4 hours after infusion (from 16 +/- 2 to 7 +/- 2 mmHg; p < 0.01), and the effect was sustained throughout the 24-hour infusion without diuresis (mean water balance, + 25 +/- 12 ml/hr). This reduction was significantly correlated with the baseline value before infusion (r = -0.85, p < 0.01). The effect on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was accompanied by small reductions (approximately 20%) in systemic blood pressure and cardiac index, without significant changes in systemic vascular resistance and heart rate. These results indicate that prolonged administration of low to medium doses of synthetic ANF causes potent and sustained left ventricular unloading without reflex, tachycardia and volume depletion, and may thus be safe and have potential benefits for patients with coronary heart disease."
CD009647,0,16440607,0,Environmental temperature and mortality.,"In Finland, mortality increases steeply in autumn, reaches a peak during the Christhmas holidays and declines slowly towards a trough in August. The relative excess in daily mortality (peak vs. trough) is 30% for coronary heart disease, 40% for cerebral vascular accidents and 90% for diseases of the respiratory organs. There is a secondary peak in Midsummer, especially in coronary deaths of working aged men. Mortality is lowest at mean daily temperature of +14 degrees C, and it increases slowly with falling temperature and steeply with increasing temperature. An estimated 2000-3000 extra deaths occur in Finland during the cold season, most of which are people aged 65 years and over but 20% at working age. The number of people dying from high temperatures (over +14 degrees C) in this country in a normal year is 100-200. Heat deaths are mostly certified as being due to cardiovascular or respiratory conditions. Exposure to cold air causes a rise in blood pressure and haemoconcentration which lead to increased tendency to vascular thromboses. In hot weather, haemoconcentration due to sweating and perspiration increases blood viscosity and the risk of thrombosis. Both cold and heat are significant public health hazards which should be taken into account in health care and education of health professionals."

CD009647,0,1940116,0,Tips on promoting food and fluid intake in the elderly.,"Nurses have a crucial role in ensuring adequate food and fluid intake in the elderly. Nurses can improve the nutritional intake of their elderly patients by obtaining proper nutritional assessments, addressing risk factors for malnutrition and fluid deficit, providing enough staff and volunteers to help feed impaired patients, honoring each older person's meal pattern, scheduling drug regimens that do not interfere with food and fluid intake, not scheduling food-related activities and visits too near mealtime, serving food that is palatable and attractively served, ensuring adequate fluid intake, and being creative in finding ways to keep the restless, wandering patient well-nourished and hydrated. Monitoring food and fluid intake requires precise recording of what foods and fluids the older person is ingesting, keeping accurate intake and output records, determining periodic weights, informing the physician of patients' weight loss in a timely manner, and instituting corrective measures at once."
CD009647,0,2993397,0,Hemodynamic and clinical significance of the pulmonary vascular response to long-term captopril therapy in patients with severe chronic heart failure.,"Exercise capacity in patients with left heart failure is closely related to the performance of the right ventricle and the pulmonary circulation. To determine the significance of changes in pulmonary resistance during long-term vasodilator therapy, hemodynamic studies were performed before and after 1 to 3 months of treatment with captopril in 75 patients with severe chronic left heart failure. Patients were grouped according to the relative changes in pulmonary and systemic resistances during long-term therapy: patients in Group I (n = 24) showed greater decreases in pulmonary arteriolar resistance (PAR) than in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (% delta PAR/% delta SVR greater than 1.0), whereas patients in Group II showed predominant systemic vasodilation (% delta PAR/% delta SVR less than 1.0). Despite similar changes in systemic resistance, patients in Group I showed greater increases in cardiac index, stroke volume index and left ventricular stroke work index (p less than 0.01 to 0.001) but less dramatic decreases in mean systemic arterial pressure (p less than 0.02) than did patients in Group II. Despite similar changes in left ventricular filling pressure, patients in Group I showed greater decreases in mean pulmonary artery and mean right atrial pressures (p less than 0.02 to 0.01) than did patients in Group II. Pretreatment variables in Groups I and II were similar, except that plasma renin activity was higher (8.7 +/- 2.1 versus 3.0 +/- 0.6 ng/ml per h) and serum sodium concentration was lower (133.1 +/- 0.9 versus 137.1 +/- 0.6 mEq/liter) in Group II than in Group I (both p less than 0.05). Both groups improved clinically after 1 to 3 months, but symptomatic hypotension occurred more frequently in Group II than in Group I (36 versus 8%) (p less than 0.005). These findings indicate that changes in the pulmonary circulation modulate alterations in both right and left ventricular performance during the treatment of patients with left heart failure. Hyponatremic patients are likely to experience symptomatic hypotension with captopril because they are limited in their ability to increase cardiac output as a result of an inadequate pulmonary vasodilator response to the drug."
