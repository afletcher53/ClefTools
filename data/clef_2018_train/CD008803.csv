CD008803,0,24528923,0,Automatic method of analysis of OCT images in assessing the severity degree of glaucoma and the visual field loss.,"In many practical aspects of ophthalmology, it is necessary to assess the severity degree of glaucoma in cases where, for various reasons, it is impossible to perform a visual field test - static perimetry. These are cases in which the visual field test result is not reliable, e.g. advanced AMD (Age-related Macular Degeneration). In these cases, there is a need to determine the severity of glaucoma, mainly on the basis of optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) structure. OCT is one of the diagnostic methods capable of analysing changes in both, ONH and RNFL in glaucoma."

CD008803,0,11224715,0,The diagnostic value of optic nerve imaging in early glaucoma.,"In the last decade, new imaging techniques have been added to conventional fundus photography and have been evaluated for use in early glaucoma. They all measure the loss of neuroretinal rim or retinal nerve fiber layer as a correlate to glaucomatous ganglion cell and axon loss. The value of optic disc photography, planimetry, laser scanning tomography, laser scanning polarimetry, and optical coherence tomography for the diagnosis of glaucomatous eyes in a preperimetric or early perimetric stage is analyzed on the basis of sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. It becomes clear that all these techniques allow a more or less semi-automated evaluation of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer but still have their limitations in the diagnosis of a very early, preperimetric stage of the glaucoma disease."

Patients with NTG underwent eye examination, optic disc imaging with Heildelberg Retina Tomograph II (HRT II) and ultrasound corneal pachymetry. The morphological parameters of the optic discs were used to classify the eyes into four groups: generalized enlargement (GE) type, myopic glaucomatous (MY) type, focal ischemic (FI) type and senile sclerotic (SS) type. A correlation between CCT and optic disc morphology obtained by HRT II was calculated. Multiple comparison and post hoc tests were performed in order to determine the significance of the differences between the four groups. The strongest correlation was between CCT and the parameters of optic disc imaging obtained at HRT II in the GE type of optic disc."

CD008803,0,22847249,0,Clinical outcomes of non-Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty.,"To describe the results of non-Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (non-DSAEK). Retrospective, interventional, consecutive clinical case series. Twenty-three patients underwent non-DSAEK from January 2010 to February 2011. The various indications were pseudophakic corneal edema, aphakic corneal edema, failed graft, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and congenital glaucoma. Corneal edema cleared in all patients within 1-4 weeks. Mean follow-up duration was 7.6 months. Post-operative best corrected visual acuity ranged from 20/400 to 20/40. Fourteen patients had co-morbid factors affecting the vision. No patient had interface haze. Immediate post-operative complications were partial graft detachment (1 patient) and secondary angle closure (1 patient). Corneal clarity was restored following secondary interventions. One late post-operative complication was graft rejection at 6 months, leading to graft failure. Non-DSAEK is a safe and viable option in cases of corneal decompensation when the Descemet membrane is non-pathological."
CD008803,0,22847248,0,Prospective study on retinal nerve fibre layer changes after an acute episode of phacomorphic angle closure.,"To investigate the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) changes after an acute attack of phacomorphic angle closure. This prospective study involved ten cases of phacomorphic angle closure that underwent cataract extraction and intraocular lens insertion after intraocular pressure lowering. Apart from visual acuity and intraocular pressure (IOP), RNFL thickness and vertical cup disc ratio (VCDR) were measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) at 3-9 months post attack. Humphrey visual field assessment was performed at 9 months post attack. All cases had mean phacomorphic duration of <5 days. Postoperatively, best correct Snellen visual acuity was 0.4 ± 0.2 and IOP at 9 months was 11.0 ± 3.1 mmHg. There was no difference in VCDR and RNFL between the attack and contralateral eye at 3 months post attack (both p = 0.4). At 9 months post attack, there was significant thinning in the average (p = 0.01), superior (p = 0.01), and inferior (p = 0.006) RNFL. There was no significant difference in the pattern standard deviation (PSD) between the two eyes on the Humphrey visual field nor was there any correlation between PSD severity and RNFL thinning (all p > 0.2. Patients with <5 days duration of phacomorphic angle closure are likely to have reasonable postoperative vision. An acute episode of phacomorphic angle closure can trigger an accelerated RNFL thinning despite normal IOP and open angles, most noticeable in the superior and inferior quadrants, occurring between 3 and 9 months post attack. Glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the attack eye was evident by OCT but not by visual field assessment at the same time interval."

Current concepts of glaucoma diagnosis focus on structural assessment and structure-function correlation, and relies less on the finding of visual field abnormalities. In turn, contemporary approaches to management have also changed and revolve around earlier initiation of pressure lowering medication based on pre-perimetric findings. This article presents an approach to the assessment of the patient with suspected glaucoma, highlighting those structural and ancillary diagnostic investigations that will aid in the correct diagnosis. It also discusses the differentiation of glaucoma from other, non-glaucomatous disease processes."

CD008803,0,24101128,0,Physiological variation of segmented OCT retinal layer thicknesses is short-lasting.,"The application of spectral domain optical coherence tomography as a surrogate for neurodegeneration in a range of neurological disorders demands better understanding of the physiological variation of retinal layer thicknesses, which may mask any value of this emerging outcome measure. A prospective study compared retinal layer thicknesses between control subjects (n = 15) and runners (n = 27) participating in a 10-km charity run. Three scans were performed using an eye-tracking function (EBF) and automated scan registration for optimal precision at (1) baseline, (2) directly after the run, and (3) following a rehydration period. Retinal layer segmentation was performed with suppression of axial retinal vessel signal artifacts. Following the run, there was an increase in the relative retinal nerve fibre layer (p = 0.018), the combined inner plexiform/ganglion cell layer (p = 0.038), and the outer nuclear layer (p = 0.018) in runners compared to controls. The initial increase of thickness in the outer nuclear layer of runners (p < 0.0001) was likely related to (noncompliant) rehydration during exercise. Following a period of rest and rehydration, the difference in thickness change for all retinal layers, except the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) (p < 0.05), disappeared between the two groups. There is a quantifiable change in the axial thickness of retinal layersthat which can be explained by an increase in the cellular volume. This effect may potentially be caused by H2O volume shifts."

Report 1: reproducibility and intraobserver variability coefficients].,"29 patients with initial primary open angle glaucoma were examined using Heidelberg retinal tomograph III (HRT III). In one visit 2 observers took 2 measurements. Intra- and interobserver errors (reproducibility and intraobserver variability coefficient) were calculated for 13 stereometric parameters of optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Rim area, cup depth (mean, maximum) and linear cup/disc ratios showed to be minimally variable. Cup area and volume, disc/cup area ratio were found to have greater variability. When performed by different observers (each entering his own contour) reproducibility was 1,4 fold lower compared with intraobserver reproducibility."

The following factors were found to cause outliers in stereometric parameters of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer: standard reference height showing large difference of measurements or very high values, significant difference of scan depth, small optic disc, astigmatism, old age, interobserver variability of disc area (contour line position). Considering these factors one can determine indications for control examination thus improving method accuracy."

Intra- and interobserver errors (reproducibility and intraobserver variability coefficient) for mean RNFL thickness and its thickness in temporal, upper, nasal and inferior quadrants. Mean RNFL thickness measured with SD-OCT showed the highest intra- and interobserver reproducibility and minimal variability. Intraobserver variability coefficient was 3 times lower as compared with the best parameter measured with HRT (rim area) and it was 7 fold lower as compared with mean RNFL thickness measured with HRT. Thus study of RNFL using SD-OCT showed high reproducibility and low variability particularly for mean RNFL thickness. The measurement error of SOCT is lower as compared with HRT and provides the most accurate study of RNFL."
CD008803,0,24359130,0,Intraocular pressure regulation: findings of pulse-dependent trabecular meshwork motion lead to unifying concepts of intraocular pressure homeostasis.,"Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only treatable risk factor in glaucoma, one of the world's leading causes of blindness. Mechanisms that maintain IOP within a normal range have been poorly understood in contrast to intrinsic mechanisms that regulate systemic blood pressure. Vessel walls experience continuous pulse-induced cyclic pressure and flow. Pressure-dependent wall stress and flow-dependent shear stress provide sensory signals that initiate mechanotransduction responses. The responses optimize vessel wall elasticity, compliance and lumen size, providing a feedback loop to maintain intrinsic pressure homeostasis. Aqueous humor is part of a vascular circulatory loop, being secreted into the anterior chamber of the eye from the vasculature, then returning to the vasculature by passing through the trabecular meshwork (TM), a uniquely modified vessel wall interposed between the anterior chamber and a vascular sinus called Schlemm's canal (SC). Since pressure in circulatory loops elsewhere is modulated by cyclic stresses, one might predict similar pressure modulation in the aqueous outflow system. Recent laboratory evidence in fact demonstrates that cyclic IOP changes alter aqueous outflow while increasing cellularity and contractility of TM cells. Cyclic changes also lead to alterations in gene expression, changes in cytoskeletal networks and modulation of signal transduction. A new technology, phase-based optical coherence tomography, demonstrates in vivo pulse-dependent TM motion like that elsewhere in the vasculature. Recognition of pulse-dependent TM motion provides a linkage to well-characterized mechanisms that provide pressure homeostasis in the systemic vasculature. The linkage may permit unifying concepts of pressure control and provide new insights into IOP homeostatic mechanisms."

CD008803,0,23557847,0,Regional pathology in glaucoma--an overlooked link to neuroprotective strategies.,"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the second commonest cause of blindness in the world. It is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by retinal ganglion cell loss. The molecular mechanism leading to glaucoma damage is unclear. Understanding the pathways that favor neuronal survival plus those that predispose to neuronal demise in POAG may have direct implications for other neurodegenerative diseases. POAG is a heterogeneous disease. A small subset of POAG patients develop damage in a highly focal form with a discrete sector of the optic nerve manifesting well delineated neuronal loss. It is hypothesized that this pattern of nerve loss indicates the optic nerve is not molecularly homogeneous. Genetic analysis of patients with isolated focal forms of POAG may enable new genes to be identified in glaucoma. Finding the responsible genes in POAG is a critical first step. The potential implications are earlier disease detection with resultant optimized visual preservation. Future treatment options could develop that include altered gene regulation, gene silencing or introducing repair genes. Determining the molecular causes for regional neuronal susceptibility could lead to identification of pathways underlying disease and ultimately effective patient-specific neuroprotective strategies."

A method to detect metabolic changes in the fundus].,"The detection of metabolic changes opens the possibility for intervention of reversible pathological alterations. Measurements of oxygen saturation are limited to the blood vessel system. Detection of alterations in oxygen concentrations are up to 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive by autofluorescence of coenzymes than by measurement of oxygen saturation. Because of limited transmission of the ocular media no specific excitation of endogenous fluorophores can be realised. For this reason it was investigated if the fluorescence lifetime after pulse excitation can be detected at the human fundus. Applying a laser scanner ophthalmoscope and mode-locked Ar(+) laser as well as time-correlated single photon counting, lifetime images of the living fundus were obtained. In mono-exponential approximation, a mean lifetime of 5 ns was detected from the optic disc and large vessels whereas about 1.5 ns were detected in the parapapillary area. By evaluating the frequency of lifetimes, lipofuscin, free FAD, and collagen are probably detectable. Comparative measurements were performed in fundus specimens and on free FAD."

CD008803,0,6512150,0,Component evaluation of cup/disk ratio estimation.,"Cup/disk (C/D) ratio estimation is frequently used to evaluate cupping within the optic nerve head. Two components are involved in the determination of this value: (1) the cup and disk margin determination, and subsequently (2) the magnitude estimation of the cup size relative to the disk size. This study investigated the magnitude estimation component by asking fourth year optometry students to estimate C/D ratios on optic nerve head photographs and drawings. The importance of the magnitude estimation was demonstrated by the high degree of variability among subjects on the nerve head drawings upon which cup and disk margins were presented unambiguously. A subsequent survey of faculty clinicians indicated a large percentage of practitioners (41%) have no method they consciously use to help determine their C/D ratio estimate. A specific method is presented which allows clinicians to simply and logically deduce this magnitude estimation."

All subjects underwent high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography to evaluate RNFL thickness. HFA subjects presented with reduced global RNFL thickness compared both to AS subjects and controls. AS subjects showed a reduced nasal quadrant RNFL thickness compared to controls. Verbal-IQ/performance-IQ discrepancy correlated with RNFL thickness. Our data suggest that RNFL evaluation could help in the development of biological markers of autism pathophysiology."

CD008803,0,24413621,0,Greater attenuation of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in Alzheimer's disease patients.,"Thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) may reflect neurodegeneration of the central nervous system, which has been reported as part of the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, AD patients have thinner RNFL as compared to age-matched normal controls. However, whether reduction of RNFL over time can predict those at higher risk to develop cognitive deterioration remains unknown. We therefore set out a prospective clinical investigation to determine both the reduction of RNFL thickness and the deterioration of cognitive function over a period of 25 months in 78 participants (mean age 72.31 ± 3.98 years, 52% men). The participants were categorized as stable participants whose cognitive status remained unchanged (n = 60) and converted participants whose cognitive status deteriorated, which was diagnosed by DSM-VI (for AD) and Petersen's definition (for mild cognitive impairment) (n = 18). Here we show for the first time that the converted participants had greater reduction of RNFL thickness than the stable participants. Specifically, the reduction in the thickness of the inferior quadrant RNFL in the converted participants was greater than that in stable participants [-11.0 ± 12.8 (mean ± standard deviation) μm versus 0.4 ± 15.7 μm, p = 0.009]. These data showed that greater reduction in the inferior quadrant of RNFL thickness might indicate a higher risk for the old adults to develop cognitive deterioration. These findings have established a system to embark on a larger scale study to further test whether changes in RNFL thickness can serve as a biomarker of AD."

CD008803,0,22995953,0,Glaucomatous damage of the macula.,"There is a growing body of evidence that early glaucomatous damage involves the macula. The anatomical basis of this damage can be studied using frequency domain optical coherence tomography (fdOCT), by which the local thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and local retinal ganglion cell plus inner plexiform (RGC+) layer can be measured. Based upon averaged fdOCT results from healthy controls and patients, we show that: 1. For healthy controls, the average RGC+ layer thickness closely matches human histological data; 2. For glaucoma patients and suspects, the average RGC+ layer shows greater glaucomatous thinning in the inferior retina (superior visual field (VF)); and 3. The central test points of the 6° VF grid (24-2 test pattern) miss the region of greatest RGC+ thinning. Based upon fdOCT results from individual patients, we have learned that: 1. Local RGC+ loss is associated with local VF sensitivity loss as long as the displacement of RGCs from the foveal center is taken into consideration; and 2. Macular damage is typically arcuate in nature and often associated with local RNFL thinning in a narrow region of the disc, which we call the macular vulnerability zone (MVZ). According to our schematic model of macular damage, most of the inferior region of the macula projects to the MVZ, which is located largely in the inferior quadrant of the disc, a region that is particularly susceptible to glaucomatous damage. A small (cecocentral) region of the inferior macula, and all of the superior macula (inferior VF), project to the temporal quadrant, a region that is less susceptible to damage. The overall message is clear; clinicians need to be aware that glaucomatous damage to the macula is common, can occur early in the disease, and can be missed and/or underestimated with standard VF tests that use a 6° grid, such as the 24-2 VF test."

The optic nerve head of 22 eyes (22 patients) was analyzed by confocal laser tomography with the Heidelberg retinal tomogram (HRT) before and after trabeculectomy. The median time between the first HRT and surgery was 4.6 months (mean: 7.7 +/- 8.3) and the median time between surgery and the second HRT was 10.8 months (mean: 12.0 +/- 6.8). The patients were divided into two groups, i.e., those with the highest (group A) and lowest (group B) intraocular pressure (IOP) change after surgery. Differences in the 12 standard topographic parameters before and after surgery for each group were evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the differences in these parameters between the two groups were compared by the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate the influence of the change in IOP (DeltaIOP and DeltaIOP%) and the changes in the other parameters. There were significant differences in the HRT measures before and after surgery in group A only for cup volume. In group B, no parameter was statistically different. The changes in group A were not significantly different than those in group B for any parameter (P > 0.004, Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). DeltaIOP and DeltaIOP% had a statistically significant effect on Delta cup disk area, Delta cup volume and Delta mean cup depth. Changes in cup shape size were influenced significantly only by DeltaIOP. Some optic disc parameters measured by HRT presented a significant improvement after filtering surgery, depending on the amount of IOP reduction. Long-term studies are needed to determine the usefulness of these findings as outcome measures in the management of glaucoma."

CD008803,0,21601066,0,Lesions of the optic nerve.,"As experts on the central nervous system, neurologists are expected to be familiar with the many conditions that can result in visual loss arising from lesions of the optic nerve. The optic nerves are unique central nervous system structures in terms of surrounding anatomy, size, location, and blood supply; therefore, they are uniquely vulnerable to every pathological process that can affect the central and peripheral nervous systems, including inflammation, ischemia, compression, infiltration, toxic or hereditary metabolic dysfunction, trauma, and mechanical damage. This chapter highlights the importance of being able to identify the historical and clinical features that will enable neurologists to narrow down the broad differential diagnosis of optic nerve lesions. Distinguishing an optic neuropathy on the basis of history and clinical examination alone, however, can be difficult, especially when bilateral optic neuropathies are present. Specific ancillary tests, especially new imaging modalities, help further localization and differential diagnosis."
CD008803,0,20493584,0,[Diagnosing bilateral papilledema].,"Bilateral optic disc swelling requires following a number of steps from discovery to causal diagnosis. First, it is necessary to differentiate between true optic disc swelling and disc elevation without true swelling. Then fundus examination, visual acuity and visual field, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography are performed in order to differentiate papilledema secondary to increased intracranial pressure from optic disc swelling secondary to optic neuropathy. Even if the most frequent etiology is idiopathic intracranial hypertension, the clinician must check for the absence of any signs or symptoms related to hypertension secondary to a cerebral tumor or to cerebral venous thrombosis. Fortunately, modern imaging techniques have facilitated the differential diagnoses of optic disc swelling, and the combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography appears to be necessary each time the diagnosis of idiopathic hypertension is suggested."

Baseline scans were made during rest, while for the follow-up scan, 23 subjects (50 %) performed strenuous physical exercise. Systemic and retinal hyperaemia were quantified. Quantification of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness was performed with and without suppression of retinal blood vessel artifacts. The potential systematic effect on RNFL thickness measurements was analysed using Bland-Altman plots. At baseline (no retinal hyperaemia), there was a systematic difference in RNFL thickness (3.4 μm, limits of agreement -0.9 to 7.7) with higher values if blood vessel artifacts were not suppressed. There was significant retinal hyperaemia in the exercise group (p < 0.0001). Baseline thickness increased from 93.18 to 93.83 μm (p < 0.05) in the exercise group using the algorithm with blood vessel artifact suppression, but no significant changes were observed using the algorithm without blood vessel artifact suppression. Retinal hyperaemia leads to blood vessel artifacts which are relevant to the precision of OCT layer segmentation algorithms. The two algorithms investigated in this study can not be used interchangeably. The algorithm with blood vessel artifact suppression was more sensitive in detecting small changes in RNFL thickness. This may be relevant for the use of OCT in a range of neurodegenerative diseases were only a small degree of retinal layer atrophy have been found so far."

CD008803,0,24223903,0,Neuroprotection in a novel mouse model of multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease that currently lacks any neuroprotective treatments. Innovative neuroprotective trial designs are required to hasten the translational process of drug development. An ideal target to monitor the efficacy of strategies aimed at treating multiple sclerosis is the visual system, which is the most accessible part of the human central nervous system. A novel C57BL/6 mouse line was generated that expressed transgenes for a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-specific T cell receptor and a retinal ganglion cell restricted-Thy1 promoter-controlled cyan fluorescent protein. This model develops spontaneous or induced optic neuritis, in the absence of paralytic disease normally associated with most rodent autoimmune models of multiple sclerosis. Demyelination and neurodegeneration could be monitored longitudinally in the living animal using electrophysiology, visual sensitivity, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography all of which are relevant to human trials. This model offers many advantages, from a 3Rs, economic and scientific perspective, over classical experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models that are associated with substantial suffering of animals. Optic neuritis in this model led to inflammatory damage of axons in the optic nerve and subsequent loss of retinal ganglion cells in the retina. This was inhibited by the systemic administration of a sodium channel blocker (oxcarbazepine) or intraocular treatment with siRNA targeting caspase-2. These novel approaches have relevance to the future treatment of neurodegeneration of MS, which has so far evaded treatment."

We conducted a multicenter study to clarify the ophthalmic features of patients with molecularly confirmed CHARGE syndrome. Thirty-eight eyes in 19 patients with CHARGE syndrome and confirmed CHD7 mutations treated at four centers were retrospectively studied. Colobomata affected the posterior segment of 35 eyes in 18 patients. Both retinochoroidal and optic disk colobomata were bilaterally observed in 15 patients and unilaterally observed in 3 patients. The coloboma involved the macula totally or partially in 21 eyes of 13 patients. We confirmed that bilateral large retinochoroidal colobomata represents a typical ophthalmic feature of CHARGE syndrome in patients with confirmed CHD7 mutations; however, even eyes with large colobomata can form maculas. The anatomical severity of the eye defect was graded according to the presence of colobomata, macula defect, and microphthalmos. A comparison of the severity in one eye with that in the other eye revealed a low-to-moderate degree of agreement between the two eyes, reflecting the general facial asymmetry of patients with CHARGE syndrome. The location of protein truncation and the anatomical severity of the eyes were significantly correlated. We suggested that the early diagnosis of retinal morphology and function may be beneficial to patients, since such attention may determine whether treatment for amblyopia, such as optical correction and patching, will be effective in facilitating the visual potential or whether care for poor vision will be needed."

The aim of this study was to record the on and off responses of the photopic fullfield electroretinogram (ERG) in normal subjects and glaucoma patients. We focused on different waves of the responses after onset and offset of the long-duration stimulus ERG. Photopic fullfield ERGs were recorded in response to a white bright LED flash on a white 20 cd/m(2) background. Stimulus luminances were 40, 60 and 80 cd/m(2). Responses were averaged using a flash duration of 240 ms and an offset period of 500 ms. We examined 19 healthy subjects, 27 patients with glaucomatous optic disc atrophy and 7 ocular hypertensive patients. The amplitudes and implicit times of the on and off responses of the human ERG depended on flash luminance. Comparing patients with glaucoma and healthy subjects for the 60 cd/m² flash, there was a significant change in the PhNRs (at onset: P < 0.01, at offset: P < 0.001) of the d-wave and of the i-wave at offset (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found for peak times of the fullfield ERG and for a- and b-wave amplitudes. PhNR amplitudes were significantly correlated with mean thickness of retinal nerve fibre layer as measured with OCT. In comparison with the normal photopic long-flash ERG, glaucoma patients showed changes in the PhNR amplitude following stimulus onset and in waves following stimulus offset."

Optic neuritis in children has specific clinical features and a better prognosis than in adulthood. Although usually appears an underlying viral disease, the main concern for practitioners is the relationship of optic neuritis with multiple sclerosis. In addition to the classical techniques as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), current tendencies of diagnosis for eye practitioners include new imaging devices as optical coherence tomography (OCT), useful to show a thinning of the retinal fibers layer (RFL) after the inflammatory episode. Regarding the management of these patients, short-term intravenous steroid dosages seem to be the best option to treat acute attacks characterized by a very poor bilateral VA."

CD008803,0,11944846,0,Scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) for optic nerve head drusen.,"Optic nerve head drusen (ONHD) are either clinically invisible or clearly protruding from the disc, in the later case leading to the condition of an irregular, indistinct disc margin or a swollen disc on biomicroscopy. They also may cause visual field defects, even with slow progression. Scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) has been proposed as a rapid, objective and reproducible technology for retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) assessment and clinical studies have demonstrated that SLP can help to distinguish between normal and glaucomatous eyes, identify glaucoma suspects and correlates well with visual field defects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential applicability of SLP in 20 consecutive patients with optic nerve head drusen (18 bilateral) that were clinically visible (22 eyes) and invisible (16 eyes). RNFL thickness was studied in patients with and without visual field defects. Patients with visual field defects and ONHD were significantly older and had a small, but significant reduction of visual acuity. Some global SLP parameters (average thickness, ellipse average) were significantly different between subjects with normal and abnormal visual fields. The comparison of the groups with visible and invisible drusen showed that there was no difference in demographic or perimetric data. RNFL thickness measurements were also very similar in both groups. Clinical visibility of drusen was not correlated with RNFL thinning as measured with the GDxTM. SLP assessment, however, was well correlated with functional loss. This objective, non-invasive technology may be an additional option for RNFL evaluation in this condition and an especially useful tool for long-term follow-up."

The individual etiology remains unclear in many cases. Potential pathomechanisms are embolism, vasoobliteration and vascular compression. Emboli (calcified, thrombotic, myxomatous, bacterial or cholesterol) are of carotid or cardiac origin. Atherosclerotic plaques, giant-cell arteritis and other types of vasculitis may cause vasoobliteration. A retrobulbar mass (hematoma, neoplasms, retrobulbar injections) may lead to an optic nerve and central retinal artery compression. Funduscopic signs of CRAO are described. Late development of iris neovascularization and neovascular secondary glaucoma may occur in up to 15 percent of cases. The prognosis of CRAO has been poor. A spontaneous remission and recovery of visual function is rare. It has been shown experimentally that the retinal damage is irreversible after 100 minutes of non-perfusion. The initial treatment should include an immediate paracentesis of the anterior chamber, digital massage of the globe, and i.v. administration of 500 mg azetazolamide in order to stimulate retinal reperfusion by lowering the intraocular pressure. This procedure is recommended for the first 6 (up to 24) hours after onset of CRAO. More promising success rates have recently be reported by a selective intra-arterial fibrinolysis with Urokinase (100,000-1,000,000 IU) or recombinant plasminogen activator (rtPA).

The findings suggest large inter-observer differences, that is, large differences in measurement attributable to differences in definitions and methods between one observer and another. Extreme caution is indicated before attaching wide clinical or investigative importance to a specific value of CDR. A value of CDR regarded as the dividing line between normalcy and suspicion by one observer may be a highly inappropriate cutoff for another observer. Similarly, if different observers record measurements on the same patient, it may be impossible to determine whether the cup of an individual patient changes with time. Interobserver differences also can cast doubt on conclusions drawn from the comparison of data collected by different investigators.

CD008803,0,17265792,0,Retinal scanning laser polarimetry and methods to compensate for corneal birefringence.,"Scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) was developed to provide objective assessment of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), a birefringent tissue, by measuring the total retardation in the reflected light. The birefringence of the anterior segment of the eye, mainly the cornea, is a confounding variable to the RNFL measurement. Anterior segment birefringence varies over a wide range among individuals. This paper reviews the principle of SLP and methods to measure and compensate for anterior segment birefringence as implemented in a commercial SLP system, GDx VCC. Anterior segment birefringence is measured from the macular retardance profile. It can be neutralized with a variable retarder in the GDx VCC and the measured retardance directly represents the RNFL retardance. Alternatively, a bias retarder can be introduced in the measurement beam path with approximately vertical slow axis, SLP measures the combination of the RNFL and the bias retarder, and RNFL retardance is then mathematically extracted from the measurement. The latter has the advantage of improved signal-to-noise ratio. With the combination of a visual RNFL image and rapid, objective, and reproducible assessment of the RNFL, GDx VCC provides an attractive clinical tool in glaucoma management."

CD008803,0,22894509,0,Phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography characterization of pulse-induced trabecular meshwork displacement in ex vivo nonhuman primate eyes.,"Glaucoma is a blinding disease for which intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only treatable risk factor. The mean IOP is regulated through the aqueous outflow system, which contains the trabecular meshwork (TM). Considerable evidence indicates that trabecular tissue movement regulates the aqueous outflow and becomes abnormal during glaucoma; however, such motion has thus far escaped detection. The purpose of this study is to describe anovel use of a phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PhS-OCT) method to assess pulse-dependent TM movement. For this study, we used enucleated monkey eyes, each mounted in an anterior segment holder. A perfusion system was used to control the mean IOP as well as to provide IOP sinusoidal transients (amplitude 3 mmHg, frequency 1 pulse/second) in all experiments. Measurements were carried out at seven graded mean IOPs (5, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mm Hg). We demonstrate that PhS-OCT is sensitive enough to image/visualize TM movement synchronous with the pulse-induced IOP transients, providing quantitative measurements of dynamic parameters such as velocity, displacement, and strain rate that are important for assessing the biomechanical compliance of the TM. We find that the largest TM displacement is in the area closest to Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelium. While maintaining constant ocular pulse amplitude, an increase of mean IOP results in a decrease of TM displacement and mean size of the SC. These results demonstrate that the PhS-OCT is a useful imaging technique capable of assessing functional properties necessary to maintain IOP in a healthy range, offering a new diagnostic alternative for glaucoma."

Fifty-six eyes of 45 recruited patients were classified into two groups: group 1 had medically controlled CACG (IOP <or= 21 mmHg) comprising 35 eyes and group 2 medically uncontrolled CACG (IOP > 21 mmHg with maximum tolerated medications) including 21 eyes. All of the patients had at least one quadrant without peripheral anterior synechia in gonioscopy. After phacoemulsification, a viscoelastic agent was used for viscogoniasynecialysis. Success was defined as IOP <or= 21 mmHg with (relative success) or without (absolute success) medications. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding age and gender. In group 1, the mean IOP and number of medications declined from 16.7 +/- 2.9 to 14.4 +/- 2.9 (P < 0.0001) and 2.6 +/- 0.8 to 0.82 +/- 0.82 (P < 0.0001), respectively. The absolute success rate at the last follow-up (9 +/- 5.3 months) was 40%. In group 2, the mean IOP and number of medications diminished from 27.95 +/- 8.1 to 15.5 +/- 2.8 (P < 0.0001) and 2.9 +/- 0.62 to 1.2 +/- 1.2 (P < 0.0001), respectively. The absolute success rate was 38.1% at the last follow-up (9.5 +/- 5.3 months). Postoperatively, seven patients developed pupillary fibrin formation that was treated using steroids and ND:YAG laser.

Several design configurations are characterized to illustrate trade-offs between acquisition speed, resolution, imaging range, sensitivity and sensitivity roll-off performance. Ultrahigh resolution OCT with 2.5 - 3.0 micron axial image resolution is demonstrated at approximately 100,000 axial scans per second. A high resolution spectrometer design improves sensitivity roll-off and imaging range performance, trading off imaging speed to 70,000 axial scans per second. Ultrahigh speed imaging at >300,000 axial scans per second with standard image resolution is also demonstrated. Ophthalmic OCT imaging of the normal human retina is investigated. The high acquisition speeds enable dense raster scanning to acquire densely sampled volumetric three dimensional OCT (3D-OCT) data sets of the macula and optic disc with minimal motion artifacts. Imaging with approximately 8 - 9 micron axial resolution at 250,000 axial scans per second, a 512 x 512 x 400 voxel volumetric 3D-OCT data set can be acquired in only approximately 1.3 seconds. Orthogonal registration scans are used to register OCT raster scans and remove residual axial eye motion, resulting in 3D-OCT data sets which preserve retinal topography. Rapid repetitive imaging over small volumes can visualize small retinal features without motion induced distortions and enables volume registration to remove eye motion. Cone photoreceptors in some regions of the retina can be visualized without adaptive optics or active eye tracking. Rapid repetitive imaging of 3D volumes also provides dynamic volumetric information (4D-OCT) which is shown to enhance visualization of retinal capillaries and should enable functional imaging. Improvements in the speed and performance of 3D-OCT volumetric imaging promise to enable earlier diagnosis and improved monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy in ophthalmology, as well as have a wide range of research and clinical applications in other areas."

CD008803,0,23264331,0,Postsurgical cystoid macular edema.,"Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a primary cause of postoperative reduced vision. It may occur even when the intraoperative course is successful for operations such as cataract and vitreoretinal surgery. Its incidence following modern cataract surgery is 0.1%-2.35%. This risk is increased if there are certain preexisting systemic or ocular conditions and when there are intraoperative complications. The etiology of CME is not completely understood. Prolapsed or incarcerated vitreous and postoperative inflammatory processes have been proposed as causative agents. Pseudophakic CME is characterized by poor postoperative visual acuity. Fluorescein angiography is indispensable in the workup of CME, showing the classical perifoveal petaloid staining pattern and late leakage of the optic disk. Optical coherence tomography is a useful diagnostic tool, which displays cystic spaces in the outer nuclear layer. The most important differential diagnoses include age-related macular degeneration and other causes of CME such as diabetic macular edema. Most cases of pseudophakic CME resolve spontaneously. The value of prophylactic treatment is doubtful. First-line treatment of postsurgical CME should include topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be considered complementary. In cases of resistant CME, periocular or intraocular corticosteroids present an option. Antiangiogenic agents, though experimental, should be considered for nonresponsive persistent CME. Surgical options should be reserved for special indications."

Images of the retina are obtained similar to ultrasound B-scan, with 10-microm longitudinal resolution. Because the OCT operates with a near-infrared wavelength (about 840 nm), the examination is of minimal discomfort for the patient. OCT examination is indicated in cases of macular pathologies such as vitreoretinal interface syndrome, in the early detection and quantitative assessment of macular edema, and in the evaluation of a glaucomatous damage by measuring the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.

This study aimed to determine the agreement, reproducibility, and visual correlations of retinal layer thicknesses measured by different OCT segmentation techniques, on two spectral-domain OCT devices. Macular scans of 52 MS patients and 30 healthy controls from Spectralis OCT and Cirrus HD-OCT were segmented using fully manual (Spectralis), computer-aided manual (Spectralis and Cirrus), and fully automated (Cirrus) segmentation techniques. Letter acuity was recorded. Bland-Altman analyses revealed low mean differences across OCT segmentation techniques on both devices for ganglion cell + inner plexiform layers (GCIP; 0.76-2.43 μm), inner nuclear + outer plexiform layers (INL + OPL; 0.36-1.04 μm), and outer nuclear layers including photoreceptor segment (ONL + PR; 1.29-3.52 μm) thicknesses. Limits of agreement for GCIP and ONL + PR thicknesses were narrow. Results of fully manual and computer-aided manual segmentation were comparable to those of fully automated segmentation. MS patients demonstrated macular RNFL, GCIP, and ONL + PR thinning compared to healthy controls across OCT segmentation techniques, irrespective of device (p < 0.03 for all). Low-contrast letter acuity in MS correlated significantly and more strongly with GCIP than peripapillary RNFL thicknesses, regardless of the segmentation method or device. GCIP and ONL + PR thicknesses, measured by different OCT devices and segmentation techniques, are reproducible and agree at the individual and cohort levels. GCIP thinning in MS correlates with visual dysfunction. Significant ONL + PR thinning, detectable across OCT segmentation techniques and devices, strongly supports ONL pathology in MS. Fully automated, fully manual and computer-assisted manual OCT segmentation techniques compare closely, highlighting the utility of accurate and time-efficient automated segmentation outcomes in MS clinical trials."

CD008803,0,23938857,0,Advanced multi-contrast Jones matrix optical coherence tomography for Doppler and polarization sensitive imaging.,"An advanced version of Jones matrix optical coherence tomography (JMT) is demonstrated for Doppler and polarization sensitive imaging of the posterior eye. JMT is capable of providing localized flow tomography by Doppler detection and investigating the birefringence property of tissue through a three-dimensional (3-D) Jones matrix measurement. Owing to an incident polarization multiplexing scheme based on passive optical components, this system is stable, safe in a clinical environment, and cost effective. Since the properties of this version of JMT provide intrinsic compensation for system imperfection, the system is easy to calibrate. Compared with the previous version of JMT, this advanced JMT achieves a sufficiently long depth measurement range for clinical cases of posterior eye disease. Furthermore, a fine spectral shift compensation method based on the cross-correlation of calibration signals was devised for stabilizing the phase of OCT, which enables a high sensitivity Doppler OCT measurement. In addition, a new theory of JMT which integrates the Jones matrix measurement, Doppler measurement, and scattering measurement is presented. This theory enables a sensitivity-enhanced scattering OCT and high-sensitivity Doppler OCT. These new features enable the application of this system to clinical cases. A healthy subject and a geographic atrophy patient were measured in vivo, and simultaneous imaging of choroidal vasculature and birefringence structures are demonstrated."

CD008803,0,6489766,0,Gas-mediated vitreous compression: an experimental alternative to mechanized vitrectomy.,"We have developed a simple technique in rabbit and baboon eyes that utilizes intravitreally injected perfluoropropane gas, which expands slowly to efficiently compress and displace nearly completely the vitreous body. There is cataract formation after extended contact of the gas bubble with the lens. However, it is rapidly reversible by reducing the duration of lens contact (gas-fluid exchange) and by using young animals. No long-term alterations in intraocular pressure or retinal function were observed, as determined by electroretinography, during the 4-month test period. Gross examination and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the vitreous cavity, shortly after full expansion of the gas bubble, was practically free of collagen. The vitreous body had been detached from most of the retina and compressed into a collagenous strand between the optic nerve head and lens in the rabbit eyes, and there was also a dense collagen accumulation on the inferior retinal surface and anterior vitreous base in the rabbits and the baboon. Large areas of the retina and medullary wings were stripped of overlying collagen. By the end of 4 months, the compressed vitreous body had expanded to become an irregular structure that remained separated from the retina in areas of previous detachment. Mechanized vitrectomy is a difficult procedure often needed in experimental work. We believe that the vitreous compression and gas-fluid exchange technique is a valid alterative to a mechanical approach. We also believe that we have a model that simulates the human situation of posterior vitreous detachment and vitreous syneresis."

CD008803,0,24457989,0,Safety and effects of the vector for the Leber hereditary optic neuropathy gene therapy clinical trial.,"IMPORTANCE We developed a novel strategy for treatment of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) caused by a mutation in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit IV (ND4) mitochondrial gene. OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the safety and effects of the gene therapy vector to be used in a proposed gene therapy clinical trial. DESIGN AND SETTING In a series of laboratory experiments, we modified the mitochondrial ND4 subunit of complex I in the nuclear genetic code for import into mitochondria. The protein was targeted into the organelle by agency of a targeting sequence (allotopic expression). The gene was packaged into adeno-associated viral vectors and then vitreally injected into rodent, nonhuman primate, and ex vivo human eyes that underwent testing for expression and integration by immunohistochemical analysis and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. During serial follow-up, the animal eyes underwent fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and multifocal or pattern electroretinography. We tested for rescue of visual loss in rodent eyes also injected with a mutant G11778A ND4 homologue responsible for most cases of LHON. EXPOSURE Ocular infection with recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors containing a wild-type allotopic human ND4 gene. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Expression of human ND4 and rescue of optic neuropathy induced by mutant human ND4. RESULTS We found human ND4 expressed in almost all mouse retinal ganglion cells by 1 week after injection and ND4 integrated into the mouse complex I. In rodent eyes also injected with a mutant allotopic ND4, wild-type allotopic ND4 prevented defective adenosine triphosphate synthesis, suppressed visual loss, reduced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells, and prevented demise of axons in the optic nerve. Injection of ND4 in the ex vivo human eye resulted in expression in most retinal ganglion cells. Primates undergoing vitreal injection with the ND4 test article and followed up for 3 months had no serious adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Expression of our allotopic ND4 vector in the ex vivo human eye, safety of the test article, rescue of the LHON mouse model, and the severe irreversible loss of visual function in LHON support clinical testing with mutated G11778A mitochondrial DNA in our patients."

Group A, containing 23 eyes of 12 healthy subjects, was imaged twice and group B, containing eight eyes of four subjects, was imaged three times. Intraretinal layers were segmented manually and the cup-to-disc ratio of the optic nerve head was analyzed. Custom-built automatic segmentation software was also used to segment a set of images for comparison. A total of nine intraretinal layers were visualized and extracted manually. With group A, the central foveal thickness was 186.4 ± 15.9 μm (mean ± SD). The average retinal thickness was 296.4 ± 21.3 μm. The best repeatability, obtained when two repeated scans were taken, was obtained for the outer nuclear layer followed by the ganglion cell layer, the inner nuclear layer, the retinal nerve fiber layer and the worst was obtained for the outer segment. The intraclass correlation ranged from 0.824 to 0.997. The coefficients of repeatability ranged from 3.24 to 18.3 μm, corresponding to 1.47% to 26.20%. With group B, high interclass correlations were found and the automatic segmentation results were compatible with the manual results. Our results indicated that more retinal features might be imageable using UHR-OCT."

CD008803,0,24525613,0,Artifacts in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography measurements in glaucoma.,"IMPORTANCE Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) has an integral role in the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma. Understanding the types of artifacts commonly seen in the imaging of patients being evaluated for glaucoma will help physicians better implement these data in the care of patients. OBJECTIVES To determine the frequency and distribution of SD-OCT imaging artifacts in patients being evaluated for glaucoma and to provide examples of common artifacts. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cross-sectional study design was used to examine SD-OCT images (using Spectralis SD-OCT) of 277 consecutive patients who had a diagnosis of glaucoma of any stage or had suspected glaucoma. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular thickness scans were included. For each scan, the final printout and the source images that generated the final printout were examined. If present, artifacts were classified as evident on the final printout or not and were categorized as to the primary source of the artifact (eg, ocular pathologic features or technician errors). Examples of common artifacts are provided. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The presence of imaging artifacts. RESULTS In 277 consecutive patients, 131 macular thickness scans were obtained, and 277 RNFL scans were obtained. Of the macular thickness scans, 37 (28.2%; 95% CI, 20.8%-36.1%) had imaging artifacts. Six of these artifacts were not obvious on the final printout. Of the RNFL scans, 55 (19.9%; 95% CI, 15.2%-24.6%) contained artifacts. Seven of these artifacts were not evident on the final printout. The most common cause of artifacts for macular thickness and RNFL scans was ocular pathologic features, primarily the presence of an epiretinal membrane. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE It is likely that SD-OCT-related imaging artifacts occur in 15.2% to 36.1% of scans obtained in patients being evaluated for glaucoma. Some of these artifacts may not be evident on the final printout. Physicians should be alert to the possibility of artifacts, particularly in patients with ocular pathologic features such as an epiretinal membrane."

This can be realized by the GDx which uses nerve fibre polarimetry to measure the thickness of the parapapillary nerve fibre layer.A single GDx measurement in a glaucoma patient may be an important adjunct to the clinical findings.However, at present the method is not suitable for general screening. Presumably the most important application of the device is longitudinal monitoring. In contrast to the GDx,RTA determines the thickness of the whole retina, not specifically the nerve fibre layer. This might be a reason why the discrimination between normal subjects and glaucoma patients is somewhat more difficult than with the GDx.Again, longitudinal monitoring should be the most common application of the RTA in glaucoma patients. Besides glaucoma,RTA also allows examination of macular pathologies.RTA is a promising new technique which so far is not as frequently used as the GDx or the HRT."

We tested if such changes could be explained by hydration and would exceed what may be expected from normal ageing. Subjects (n=26) of a previous study were re-assessed and were randomised to 3 groups of a hydration escalation trial (no hydration, 1× hydration, 2× hydration). Automated retinal layer segmentations were performed for the macular retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL). The averaged volumes were calculated for the central foveola, 3 mm and 6 mm circles of the ETDRS grid. Following oral hydration there were no significant differences of retinal layer thicknesses between the three randomised groups in any of the ETDRS regions at any time-point. Ageing related changes were significant over an 18 month period for the GCL. The negative outcome of this trial implies that, until the causes for the observed variation are resolved, investigators may need to accept, and include into trial power calculations, a small degree of variation (<1%) of quantitative SD-OCT imaging either due to human physiology or instrument/software related factors."

The 13 offsprings in the male line did not have microangiopathy. Nerve fiber abnormalities were not seen in asymptomatic persons. The photographically verified findings are described, classified, and discussed. It is suspected that Leber's disease is primarily a microvascular disorder.

CD008803,0,10163330,0,Current imaging of the optic disk and retinal nerve fiber layer.,"The optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) are the sites of clinically detectable glaucomatous tissue damage. Photographic techniques are used to document the optic disk and the RNFL to monitor patients with suspected primary open-angle glaucoma or to follow-up patients already suffering from this disease. New techniques such as laser scanning tomography (LST), scanning laser polarimetry, and optical coherence tomography have been introduced to quantify structural alterations with the aim of early detection of optic nerve or RNFL damage prior to functional loss. These novel, additional diagnostic tools are currently being evaluated in clinical practice. While scanning laser polarimetry and optical coherence tomography are discussed elsewhere in this volume, articles on LST and conventional techniques are considered here. Imaging and computed data processing allow for three-dimensional in vivo measurements in the range of micrometers. With regard to the structure of the optic nerve head, this aspect in the evaluation of the optic disk can be based on quantitative topographic data. We expect ""topometry"" to become an important additional tool in the early diagnosis and follow-up of patients with glaucoma. However, computed parameter readings should always be evaluated in a clinical context.

A detailed history and a detailed ocular examination including visual acuity, slit lamp examination, fundus examination through dilated pupil and fluorescein angiography were conducted. In some cases, Amsler grid, visual field, visual evoked potential and color vision test were also evaluated. The chief complaints of these 24 patients were blurred vision, central scotoma, floaters, photophobia and halo vision. The intervals between onset of fever and awareness of blurred vision were 2 to 15 days with an average of 7.26 days. The ocular fundus changes included macular hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage, maculopathy, Roth's spot, diffuse retinal edema, peripapillary hemorrhage vitreous cells and blurring optic disc. The fluorescein angiographic findings included poor choroidal flushing, delayed disc filling, disc extravasation, block fluorescence, capillary obliteration, non filling of macular network, capillary leakage and window defect. Seventeen cases (30 eyes) were followed-up for 2 weeks to 3 months. Visual recovery was good in most of the cases. However, 2 cases (4 eyes) showed poor visual outcome. In this series studied, the principle ocular fundus change caused by dengue fever was macular hemorrhage. This may be due to the capillary changes near the macular area. But in some of the cases, the direct viral invasion and/or indirect changes of the optic nerve, the retinal pigment epithelium or photoreceptors should be considered."

Since the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) is composed only of unmyelinated axons, measuring RNFL thickness represents a viable method of monitoring axonal loss in these patients. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive, noncontact, accurate, and reproducible technique that quantitates the thickness of the peripapillary RNFL, fovea, and macula. Because of its potential role in defining axonal loss in ON and in assessing longitudinal changes in the RNFL before and after MS treatment, a multidisciplinary expert panel was charged with the following tasks: assess the current capabilities of OCT; review the current data about OCT, ON, and MS; and determine whether OCT could be a primary or secondary outcome measure in future MS clinical trials. The panel concluded that: [1] OCT is valid and reproducible; [2] OCT has yielded some important limited data concerning cross-sectional studies with ON and MS; [3] more studies are required to correlate OCT results with other measures of MS disease activity; [4] after correlation with these other measures and upon agreement of standardized technical and statistical methods, OCT may evolve into a important primary or secondary outcome metric for MS clinical trials and patient care."

It is known that early stages of compressive optic neuropathy may produce reversible visual field defects, suggesting axoplasmic stasis rather than ganglion cell death. This observational, cross-sectional, case-control study assessed 34 consecutive patients (65 eyes) with Graves' hyperthyroidism and longstanding GO and 31 age-matched control subjects. The patients' multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEP) were compared to their clinical and psychophysical (standard automated perimetry [SAP]) and structural (optic coherence tomography [OCT]) diagnostic test data. Abnormal cluster defects were found in 12.3 % and 3.1 % of eyes on the interocular and monocular amplitude analysis mfVEP probability plots, respectively. As well, mfVEP latencies delays were found in 13.8 and 20 % of eyes on the interocular and monocular analysis probability plots, respectively. Interestingly, 19 % of patients with GO had ocular hypertension, and a strong correlation between intraocular pressure measured at upgaze and mfVEP latency was found. MfVEP amplitudes and visual acuity were significantly related to each other (P < 0.05), but not with the latencies delays. However, relationships between the interocular or monocular mfVEP amplitudes and latencies analysis and SAP indices or OCT data were not statistically significant. One-third of our patients with GO showed changes in the mfVEP, indicating significant subclinical optic nerve dysfunction. In this sense, the mfVEP may be a useful diagnostic tool in the clinic for early diagnosis and monitoring of optic nerve function abnormalities in patients with GO."

We examined a total of 113 participants (analysis of 211 eyes), divided into three groups: 1. 48 MS patients (66 eyes) with a history of optic neuritis (ON); 2. 35 MS patients (70 eyes) without a history of ON; 3. 30 disease-free control subjects (45 eyes). The estudy included anamnesis collection, neurological examination with assessment of EDSS scores. Refracted visual acuity prior to optical coherence tomography (OCT) was tested. RTVue-100 ОСТ system was used to assess peripapillary RNFL thickness and macular inner parameter (protocol GCC). The strongly correlated decline of the most RNFL and GCC indices was characteristic of all groups of MS patients with and without ON compared to controls. The damage of GCC was greater in patients with ON. The inverse correlation was found between the indices studied and the level of patient's disability. The study of GCC and RNFL thickness can be used to describe and characterize the level of axonal damage in MS and for objectification of neurodegenerative process in studies on neuroprotection and neuroreparation."

The assessment was made only in the arcuate area, named F1 and F2 sectors. First, 29 eyes with glaucoma were evaluated. Rim/disc ratios were calculated in each the F1 and F2 sectors. The sensitivity corresponding to the F1 and F2 sectors was determined by automatic perimeter (Octopus). Each sector was divided into three subsectors in relation to the distance from the disc margin. Retinal sensitivity in the proximal subsector was closely correlated with the rim/disc ratio in the corresponding sector and with the enlargement of glaucomatous cupping. NFA was expressed as a proximal, a distal or a total atrophy pattern. Proximal and distal visual field damage was prone to be associated with the proximal and distal NFA type respectively. Second, we examined photographs of 784 normal eyes and 50 glaucomatous eyes. The difference in the ratio of appearance of NFA was statistically significant between the 20-30s and 40-60s age groups, and between the C/D ratio less than 0.5 and C/D ratio greater than 0.5 groups. The appearance of the NFA was also classified into five patterns, according to the width. Almost all the NFAs in the normal eyes showed milder patterns, whereas almost all the NFAs in the glaucoma group showed stronger patterns. It was suggested that one of the mechanisms that causes NFA in glaucoma was a strong nerve fiber drop out that differed from aging such as local circulatory disturbance. The findings indicate that the visual field damage in glaucoma can be estimated from the funduscopic appearance of NFA."

Twenty eyes of 20 consecutive patients who underwent vitrectomy to close a MH were studied. The peripapillary RNFL thickness was measured by SD-OCT before and at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. The mean overall thickness, the thickness of the four quadrants, and the thickness of each of the 12 clock hours of the RNFL were analyzed. The mean overall RNFL thickness before surgery was 93.3 ± 9.6 lm,and it increased significantly to 98.7 ± 7.4 lm at 1 month after surgery (P\0.05). The mean overall thickness then returned to the pre-surgery level at three and 6 months. The transient increase of RNFL thickness at 1 month after surgery was statistically significant in the superior, nasal, and inferior quadrants. The increase in the thickness of the nasal quadrants was maintained for up to 6 months. When the thickness of the individual 12 clock hours were analyzed, the transient increase of RNFL thickness at 1 month after surgery was significant at each of the 0–5 o’clock positions. The transient increase in the RNFL thickness after MH surgery may be caused by mild edema of the inner retinal layers caused by the MH surgery."

CD008803,0,16987732,0,Optical coherence tomography in multiple sclerosis.,"We do not have currently satisfactory clinical and anatomical correlates to gauge disability in multiple sclerosis. Structural biomarkers (such as MRI) are hindered because they cannot precisely segregate demyelination from axonal elements of tissue injury within the CNS. Axonal degeneration in multiple sclerosis is related to irreversible disability, which suggests that the confirmation of neuroprotective strategies needs highly quantifiable measures of axon loss that can be correlated with reliable measures of physiological function. The coupling of quantifiable measures of visual function with ocular imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography, enables us to begin to understand how structural changes in the visual system influence function in patients with multiple sclerosis. In this review, we consider the usefulness of optical imaging of the retina as a biomarker for neurodegeneration in multiple-sclerosis."
CD008803,0,21853058,0,The impact of utilizing different optical coherence tomography devices for clinical purposes and in multiple sclerosis trials.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) derived retinal measures, particularly peri-papillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, have been proposed as outcome measures in remyelinating and neuroprotective trials in multiple sclerosis (MS). With increasing utilization of multiple centers to improve power, elucidation of the impact of different OCT technologies is crucial to the design and interpretation of such studies. In this study, we assessed relation and agreement between RNFL thickness and total macular volume (in MS and healthy controls) derived from three commonly used OCT devices: Stratus time-domain OCT, and Cirrus HD-OCT and Spectralis, two spectral-domain (SD) OCT devices. OCT was performed on both Cirrus HD-OCT and Stratus in 229 participants and on both Cirrus HD-OCT and Spectralis in a separate cohort of 102 participants. Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess correlation and agreement between devices. All OCT retinal measures correlated highly between devices. The mean RNFL thickness was 7.4 µm lower on Cirrus HD-OCT than Stratus, indicating overall poor agreement for this measurement between these machines. Further, the limits of agreement (LOA) between Cirrus HD-OCT and Stratus were wide (-4.1 to 18.9 µm), indicating poor agreement at an individual subject level. The mean RNFL thickness was 1.94 µm (LOA: -5.74 to 9.62 µm) higher on Spectralis compared to Cirrus HD-OCT, indicating excellent agreement for this measurement across this cohort. Although these data indicate that these three devices agree poorly at an individual subject level (evidenced by wide LOA in both study cohorts) precluding their co-utilization in everyday practice, the small difference for mean measurements between Cirrus HD-OCT and Spectralis indicate pooled results from these two SD-devices could be used as outcome measures in clinical trials, provided patients are scanned on the same machine throughout the trial, similar to the utilization of multiple different MRI platforms in MS clinical trials."

Clinical diagnosis and systemic manifestations].,"As a result of demographic changes pseudoexfoliation (PEX) syndrome, an age-related systemic disorder of the extracellular matrix, will become an increasingly important issue in clinical practice. Apart from its well-known association with cataract and glaucoma, PEX syndrome predisposes to a broad spectrum of spontaneous and surgical ocular complications due to characteristic alterations of all anterior segment tissues. In view of the high risk of glaucoma development and potential complications during cataract surgery, an accurate and early diagnosis of PEX syndrome is of considerable clinical relevance. Since the characteristic central PEX deposits are lacking in up to 50 % of patients, a reliable diagnosis requires pupillary dilation. Early stages of the disease may be recognized on the basis of subtle alterations of the lens surface in addition to poor pupillary dilation and pigment-related signs including pigment dispersion and peripupillary atrophy. Any asymmetric clinical signs, e.g., regarding pupil width, pigmentation, cataract and intraocular pressure, should alert the ophthalmologist to the potential presence of PEX syndrome. Although the description of PEX syndrome as a systemic disorder of the extracellular matrix associated with the deposition of PEX material in the skin, blood vessel walls and various organ systems dates back to the early 1990s, a causal relationship between the abnormal material deposits and systemic diseases has not yet been clearly established.

CD008803,0,23053331,0,[Diagnosis and therapy of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma].,"Pseudoexfoliation (PEX) glaucoma is the most frequent and most important type of secondary glaucoma, accounting for approximately 25% of open angle glaucoma worldwide and currently representing the most common identifiable cause of glaucoma overall. Due to high intraocular pressure levels, marked diurnal pressure fluctuations and spikes, and rapid optic nerve damage and visual field loss, PEX glaucoma represents a relatively severe and progressive type of glaucoma. Therefore, hard and fast lowering of intraocular pressure is necessary. Fixed combinations in medical therapy and early glaucoma surgery are recommended. When considering a surgical procedure (e.g. selective laser trabeculoplasty, bleb-dependent or bleb-independent surgery) the timing of cataract surgery plays a major role. Pathogenesis, clinical characteristics and therapeutic aspects of PEX glaucoma are described in the following article."

CD008803,0,25133965,0,Optical coherence tomography in papilledema: what am I missing?,"Grading of papilledema severity is subjective and based on monocular fundus features of the optic nerve. Interobserver agreement on grading the severity of papilledema is poor among expert observers, even using well-defined criteria such as the Frisen scale, which is a non-continuous ordinal scale of grading. Furthermore, non-expert clinicians often find it difficult to properly view and interpret features of the optic nerve using ophthalmoscopy, which can lead to failure to diagnose papilledema in non-ophthalmologic care settings. This may delay treatment, which can result in vision loss. Distinguishing papilledema from pseudopapilledema can also be difficult when surface drusen are not easily identified. Once papilledema is diagnosed, it is often difficult to determine whether a reduction in optic nerve edema is due solely to improvement in the status of the nerve or whether this represents concomitant loss of axons and viable retinal ganglion cells, leading to a poor visual outcome. Timely advancement of treatment would occur if loss of neurons could be diagnosed at an earlier stage of evaluation while optic disc edema is still present. This review will critically assess the role of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in solving these problems by providing an advanced imaging approach for diagnosis of papilledema and evaluating its severity on a continuous scale and evaluating the causes of visual loss in the setting of a swollen nerve."

OCT is now undergoing another transformation with multicolor technology, which acquires images using data from 3 simultaneous lasers: red, green, and blue, taking advantage of the different wavelengths of each of these colors to most precisely image 3 different zones of the retina. Rather than seeing only the surface of the retina and optic disc and any large lesions in the deeper retina, this technology provides a topographic map of the outer (red), mid (green), and inner (blue) retina somewhat similar to what is observed with fundus autoflourescence of deep retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid. Multicolor imaging will supplement and help to define what is observed with traditional fundus photography and SD-OCT. In addition, it may demonstrate abnormalities when routine photography is normal and when SD-OCT findings are equivocal. This review will illustrate the basic principles of multicolor imaging and will show clinical examples of how this technique can further define retinal and optic nerve pathology."
CD008803,0,25133966,0,Clinical trials to clinical use: using vision as a model for multiple sclerosis and beyond.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has made possible the structure-function correlations that uniquely characterize the afferent visual pathway as a model for understanding multiple sclerosis (MS) and for developing new treatments. During the past decade, OCT measures of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer (GCL + IPL) thickness have evolved from being a means to validate visual function tests, such as low-contrast letter acuity, to provide a window on the axonal and neuronal loss that are now widely recognized as contributors to permanent visual dysfunction in MS. Although acute optic neuritis (ON) leads to thinning of the RNFL by 20%-40% within 3 months after a single episode, thinning of the RNFL and GCL + IPL occur over time in MS eyes even in the absence of an acute ON history. As such, OCT and its functional and patient-reported correlates of low-contrast acuity and vision-specific quality of life (QOL) have now been incorporated into MS clinical trials. Results of an ongoing, phase 2 trial of a remyelinating agent that uses acute ON as a model for assessing therapeutic efficacy will define even further the important role for OCT in documenting structural changes as we move forward from clinical trials to clinical use."

The purpose of this study was to visualize the human AH outflow system 360° in three dimensions (3D) during active AH outflow in a virtual casting. The conventional AH outflow pathways of 7 donor eyes were imaged with a modified Bioptigen spectral-domain optical coherence tomography system (Bioptigen Inc, USA; SuperLum LTD, Ireland) at a perfusion pressure of 20 mmHg (N = 3), and 10 mmHg (N = 4). In all eyes, 36 scans (3 equally distributed in each clock hour), each covering a 2 × 3 × 2 mm volume (512 frames, each 512 × 1024 pixels), were obtained. All image data were black/white inverted, and the background subtracted (ImageJ 1.40 g, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Contrast was adjusted to isolate the ISVP. SC, collector channels, the deep and ISVP, and episcleral veins were observed throughout the limbus. Aqueous veins could be observed extending into the episcleral veins. Individual scan ISVP castings were rendered and assembled in 3D space in Amira 4.1 (Visage Imaging Inc. USA). A 360-degree casting of the ISVP was obtained in all perfused eyes. The ISVP tended to be dense and overlapping in the superior and inferior quadrants, and thinner in the lateral quadrants. The human AH outflow pathway can be imaged using SD-OCT. The more superficial structures of the AH outflow pathway present with sufficient contrast as to be optically isolated and cast in-situ 360° in cadaver eye perfusion models.

The retinal microvasculature in eleven normal human donor eyes was perfused, fixed and labelled after cannulation of the central retinal artery. The retinas were dissected and whole-mounted for confocal microscopy. Six study regions were taken radially from the edge of the optic disc. RPCs from the optic disc edge to a radial distance up to 2.5 mm were imaged and their diameters, inter-capillary distance and volume occupation measured. These were correlated with the study region as well as thickness of the RNFL. It was found that the pooled average diameter of the RPCs in the first 2.5 mm from the optic disk was 8.9 μm. Significant differences in capillary diameter were present in the six regions, with larger diameter RPCs in the superior, inferior and nasal regions, and significantly smaller diameter in the temporal region. RPCs in the arcuate fibre regions extend the furthest from the optic disc, maintained a close inter-capillary distance for a longer distance than other regions, and have the highest RPCs volume occupancy. The RPCs volume was generally correlated with RNFL thickness. In conclusion, a close correlation between RNFL and RPCs presence has been demonstrated which is supportive of their functional reliance/co-dependence. The significantly smaller temporal RPCs may be a result of the greater presence of RPCs in the two bordering arcuate fibre regions and therefore a richer availability of nutrients diffusing from these two regions."

They are frequently associated with other less known chorioretinal lesions. In order to investigate the incidence and the clinical importance of these latter lesions, the photographs and the fluorescein angiographies of the 24 fundi of 12 patients with angioid streaks were studied. The lesions associated with the angioid streaks are light areas along the streak, red paired spots, fundus peau d'orange, salmon spots, optic disc drusen and macular atrophic and exudative-hemorrhagic degenerations. The comparison between the photographs and the fluorescein angiographies of the fundus allows to deduce, in many cases, the anatomic lesion that causes the clinical appearance of the various kinds of angioid streaks and the associated lesions. Although the misinterpretation of these results sometimes led to inaccurate speculations about the nature and the pathogenesis of the angioid streaks and the associated lesions, it is important to point out that lacking histopathological reports that would clarify the true nature of the lesions associated with the angioid streaks, ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography are the only methods helpful to reveal the basic lesions."

Forty patients treated with a single intravitreal injection of 4 mg triamcinolone acetonide (triamcinolone group) were compared with 40 patients treated with three consecutive monthly intravitreal injections of 1.25 mg bevacizumab (bevacizumab group). The triamcinolone group showed a significant decrease in mean central retinal thickness (CRT) from 472.5 μm ± 120.35 to 374.0 μm ± 152.31 after 3 months (p < 0.001).

Seven hundred and eight swept source optical coherence tomography SS-OCT images from 148 patients with average age of (59.48 ± 8.97) were analyzed in this study. The angle structure is measured by fractal dimension (FD) analysis to quantify the complexity or changes of angle recess. We evaluated the FD index with biometric parameters for classification of open angle and angle closure glaucoma. The proposed fractal dimension index gives a better representation of the angle configuration for capturing the nature of the angle dynamics involved in different forms of open and closed angle glaucoma (average FD (standard deviation): 1.944 (0.045) for open and 1.894 (0.043) for closed angle).

Many patients have decreased visual acuity as a result of macular edema. We report a retrospective review of 8 patients at the University of Wisconsin with macular edema from CRVO who were treated with an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to help assess the effect of this intervention. Mean baseline visual acuity was 20/500. Mean visual acuity at the 3-month follow up was 20/220. The average gain in visual acuity was 3.3 lines (range -1 to +10). Four of 8 patients experienced a visual acuity gain of 2 or more lines at the 3-month follow up. Four of 8 patients were unchanged (within 2 lines of baseline) at the 3-month follow up. No patient had a decrease in visual acuity (2 or more line decrease from baseline). Seven of 8 patients had complete resolution of macular edema on clinical examination at the 3-month follow up. No adverse effects such as cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment or endophthalmitis were noted. We conclude that intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide may be a safe and effective treatment in some patients with macular edema due to CRVO. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated significant anatomic improvement in the majority of patients with macular edema due to CRVO treated with intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide."

CD008803,0,12582421,0,Medical backgrounders: glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Currently, glaucoma is diagnosed as a progressive optic neuropathy with characteristic optic disc and nerve fiber layer damage, usually associated with loss of visual function. The intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor for the disease, although a significant proportion of patients do not have elevated IOP. Other risk factors include older age, African descent, myopia and family history of the disease. The ophthalmoscopic examination of the optic disc is essential to identify the signs of glaucomatous optic neuropathy, such as increased cupping, neuroretinal rim thinning or optic disc hemorrhages. Glaucomatous visual field loss usually starts in the periphery, and loss of central vision does not occur until late in the course of the disease. Visual function is most commonly assessed by standard automated perimetry; however, as many as 50% of nerve fibers can be lost before the appearance of visual field defects in this test. Newer technologies have been developed to find more sensitive ways to detect early glaucoma using both functional (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency-doubling perimetry) and structural (scanning laser topography, optical coherence tomography and scanning laser polarimetry) measurements. The management of glaucoma is based on lowering the intraocular pressure to prevent further optic nerve damage. Currently, there are five major classes of medications that are used to lower the intraocular pressure: Beta-adrenergic antagonists, adrenergic agonists, parasympathomimetics, prostaglandin-like analogues and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The goal of therapy is to maintain adequate vision for patients during their lifetime, keeping in mind the possible adverse effects of the drugs. If additional lowering of IOP is indicated or if medication fails to sufficiently lower the IOP, laser trabeculoplasty is usually the next step. If IOP is still not adequately controlled, incisional glaucoma surgery is indicated. Neuroprotective agents, which directly protect the optic nerve in glaucoma, are being evaluated in clinical trials."

The aim of this study has been to analyze the ultrastructural alterations of the lamina cribrosa after RON to gain new insights in the underlying pathomechanical factors. Fifteen donor eyes underwent a standardized open-sky-vitrectomy and RON after removal of the anterior eye segment for keratoplasty. Using a microvitreoretinal blade, a radial incision was performed on the nasal hemisphere of the optic nerve head radial to the optic disc and parallel to the nerve fibre layer. The lamina cribrosa and the surrounding scleral ring were then prepared for light microscopy, scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that in 60% (n=9) of the evaluated cases the scleral ring was dissected completely and in 40% (n=6) only partially. The adjacent neuronal tissue to the dissection area showed only minimal injury. The central retinal vessels were not injured in all cases. Only complete incision of the circular ring of collagen fibrils surrounding the lamina cribrosa via RON resulted in effective relaxation of the scleral outlet and was achieved in 60% of all eyes under standardized conditions. In all cases the adjacent tissue showed only minimal injury. The high rate of incomplete dissection of the scleral outlet may be an explanation for the variable outcome seen in different studies on RON."
CD008803,0,17355059,0,Automated optic disk boundary detection by modified active contour model.,"This paper presents a novel deformable-model-based algorithm for fully automated detection of optic disk boundary in fundus images. The proposed method improves and extends the original snake (deforming-only technique) in two aspects: clustering and smoothing update. The contour points are first self-separated into edge-point group or uncertain-point group by clustering after each deformation, and these contour points are then updated by different criteria based on different groups. The updating process combines both the local and global information of the contour to achieve the balance of contour stability and accuracy. The modifications make the proposed algorithm more accurate and robust to blood vessel occlusions, noises, ill-defined edges and fuzzy contour shapes. The comparative results show that the proposed method can estimate the disk boundaries of 100 test images closer to the groundtruth, as measured by mean distance to closest point (MDCP) <3 pixels, with the better success rate when compared to those obtained by gradient vector flow snake (GVF-snake) and modified active shape models (ASM)."

To determine the anatomic variations in the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness distribution and the relationship between these anatomic variations and other ocular variables. METHODS. A complete ophthalmic examination, including measurement of visual acuity, refraction, and axial length, was performed on 269 subjects with no ophthalmic abnormalities. Further, fundus photographs and optic disc cube scans of the subjects' eyes were obtained with a fundus camera and spectral domain OCT (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dubin, CA), respectively. The distance between the foveola and the center of the optic nerve head was measured. The correlations of the angles of the peaks in the RNFL thickness profile with the axial length, spherical equivalent of refractive error (SE), and distance between the foveola and optic disc center were analyzed by simple linear regression. RESULTS. Considerable interindividual variations were found in the angles of the peaks in the RNFL thickness profile. Further, the angles in the eyes in each individual showed significant differences. The angles of the superior and inferior first peak correlated significantly with the SE, axial length, and distance between the foveola and optic disc center. CONCLUSIONS. Subjects with increased distance between the foveola and optic disc center are likely to have a temporal shift in peak RNFL thickness. RNFL profiles with horizontally deviated peak RNFL thickness differ considerably from the normative data provided with the HD-OCT system. The variations in RNFL thickness profiles should be taken into account."

We hypothesise that if the optic nerve atrophy that develops following optic neuritis is contributed to by axonal loss, it will correlate with thinning of the RNFL. Twenty-five patients were studied at least 1 year after a single unilateral attack of optic neuritis without recurrence, with a selection bias towards incomplete recovery. They had MR quantification of optic nerve cross-sectional area and optic nerve lesion length, as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement of mean RNFL thickness and macular volume, quantitative visual testing, and visual evoked potentials (VEPs). Fifteen controls were also studied. Significant optic nerve atrophy (mean decrease 30% versus controls), RNFL thinning (mean decrease 33% versus controls), and macular volume loss occurred in patients' affected eyes when compared with patients' unaffected eyes and healthy controls. The optic nerve atrophy was correlated with the RNFL thinning, macular volume loss, visual acuity, visual field mean deviation, and whole field VEP amplitude but not latency. These findings suggest that axonal loss contributes to optic nerve atrophy following a single attack of optic neuritis. By inference, axonal loss due to other post-inflammatory brain lesions is likely to contribute to the global MRI measure of brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis."

CD008803,0,16053201,0,Lymph node metastases arising from uveal melanoma.,"Since the eye lacks lymphatic vessels, uveal melanomas primarily metastasize hematogenously. Here we report the case of a patient with ciliary body ring melanoma who developed lymph node metastases after a fistulating glaucoma operation. A 40-year-old female Caucasian patient presented with unilateral pigment dispersion. Pigment dispersion glaucoma was diagnosed and since the intraocular pressure could not be managed with topical medication, transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and two trabeculectomies had to be performed. Due to enlargement of the pigmented iris mass and cell deposits in the chamber angle, a ciliary body ring melanoma was presumed and the eye enucleated. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of ""ciliary body ring melanoma"". Six months after enucleation the patient presented multiple metastases including ipsilateral preauricular and submandibular lymph node metastases. The patient died two months later. Lymph node metastases arising from ciliary body melanomas are very rare. Tumor seeding through the trabeculectomy site into the bleb and then via conjunctival lymphatic vessels might be the crucial factor for this pathway of metastases. Therefore, in cases of unilateral pigment dispersion, malignancy should be excluded before fistulating operations are performed."

CD008803,0,24776961,0,Non-invasive detection of early retinal neuronal degeneration by ultrahigh resolution optical coherence tomography.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionises the diagnosis of retinal disease based on the detection of microscopic rather than subcellular changes in retinal anatomy. However, currently the technique is limited to the detection of microscopic rather than subcellular changes in retinal anatomy. However, coherence based imaging is extremely sensitive to both changes in optical contrast and cellular events at the micrometer scale, and can generate subtle changes in the spectral content of the OCT image. Here we test the hypothesis that OCT image speckle (image texture) contains information regarding otherwise unresolvable features such as organelle changes arising in the early stages of neuronal degeneration. Using ultrahigh resolution (UHR) OCT imaging at 800 nm (spectral width 140 nm) we developed a robust method of OCT image analyses, based on spatial wavelet and texture-based parameterisation of the image speckle pattern. For the first time we show that this approach allows the non-invasive detection and quantification of early apoptotic changes in neurons within 30 min of neuronal trauma sufficient to result in apoptosis. We show a positive correlation between immunofluorescent labelling of mitochondria (a potential source of changes in cellular optical contrast) with changes in the texture of the OCT images of cultured neurons. Moreover, similar changes in optical contrast were also seen in the retinal ganglion cell- inner plexiform layer in retinal explants following optic nerve transection. The optical clarity of the explants was maintained throughout in the absence of histologically detectable change. Our data suggest that UHR OCT can be used for the non-invasive quantitative assessment of neuronal health, with a particular application to the assessment of early retinal disease."

Many glaucomatous progression detection strategies may be formulated for Scanning Laser Polarimetry (SLP) data of the local nerve fiber thickness. In this paper, several strategies, all based on repeated GDx VCC SLP measurements, are tested to identify the optimal one for clinical use. The parameters of the methods were adapted to yield a set specificity of 97.5% on real image series. For a fixed sensitivity of 90%, the minimally detectable loss was subsequently determined for both localized and diffuse loss. Due to the large size of the required data set, a previously described simulation method was used for assessing the minimally detectable loss. The optimal strategy was identified and was based on two baseline visits and two follow-up visits, requiring two-out-of-four positive tests. Its associated minimally detectable loss was 5-12 μm, depending on the reproducibility of the measurements."

CD008803,0,21274691,0,Optical coherence tomography (OCT): imaging the visual pathway as a model for neurodegeneration.,"Axonal and neuronal degeneration are important features of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurologic disorders that affect the anterior visual pathway. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive technique that allows imaging of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), a structure which is principally composed of ganglion cell axons that form the optic nerves, chiasm, and optic tracts. Since retinal axons are nonmyelinated until they penetrate the lamina cribrosa, the RNFL is an ideal structure (no other central nervous system tract has this unique arrangement) for visualizing the processes of neurodegeneration, neuroprotection and, potentially, even neuro-repair. OCT is capable of providing high-resolution reconstructions of retinal anatomy in a rapid and reproducible fashion and permits objective analysis of the RNFL (axons) as well as ganglion cells and other neurons in the macula. In a systematic OCT examination of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, RNFL thickness and macular volumes are reduced when compared to disease-free controls. Conspicuously, these changes, which signify disorganization of retinal structural architecture, occur over time even in the absence of a history of acute demyelinating optic neuritis. RNFL axonal loss in MS is most severe in those eyes with a corresponding reduction in low-contrast letter acuity (a sensitive vision test involving the perception of gray letters on a white background) and in those patients who exhibit the greatest magnitude of brain atrophy, as measured by validated magnetic resonance imaging techniques. These unique structure-function correlations make the anterior visual pathway an ideal model for investigating the effects of standard and novel therapies that target axonal and neuronal degeneration. We provide an overview of the physics of OCT, its unique properties as a non-invasive imaging technique, and its potential applications toward understanding mechanisms of brain tissue injury in MS, other optic neuropathies, and neurologic disorders."

The cases were selected, from a group of 41 patients with CPP. Average age of the cases was 37(31-54) years. The serous retinal detachment appeared under two different clinical appearances: the detachment of the internal retinal layers (DIRL) or retinal schisis, 10 cases, located between the papillae and macula, and involving the optic disc; the detachment of the external retinal layers (DERL), 9 cases, located within the macular area, without involvement of the optic disc. A number of 8 cases (42%) developed a macular hole, located within the external retinal layers. The cases with DIRL had better visual acuity, compared to those with DERL. This study proves the bilamellate character, of the serous retinal detachment. The disease starts with DIRL (retinal schisis), due to fluid passing at the level of the CPP and then DERL develops as a complication, following the degenerescence of the retinal layers within this area."

The LC has been known to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. With the advent of imaging technologies, such as enhanced depth imaging, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables us to unveil the LC in vivo features. The application of adaptive optics technology and a compensatory image-processing algorithm has further improved the visualization of the beams and pores and neural pathways of the LC and the scleral insertion sites. Monitoring the changes of these structures in relation to acute and chronic elevation of intraocular pressure would be germane to decipher the relationship between the stress and strain response of the LC and optic nerve damage and improve our understanding of glaucoma pathophysiology. While the impact of investigating the integrity of LC is substantive, considerable challenges remain for imaging the LC.

CD008803,0,17889587,0,A framework for comparing structural and functional measures of glaucomatous damage.,"While it is often said that structural damage due to glaucoma precedes functional damage, it is not always clear what this statement means. This review has two purposes: first, to show that a simple linear relationship describes the data relating a particular functional test (standard automated perimetry (SAP)) to a particular structural test (optical coherence tomography (OCT)); and, second, to propose a general framework for relating structural and functional damage, and for evaluating if one precedes the other. The specific functional and structural tests employed are described in Section 2. To compare SAP sensitivity loss to loss of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) requires a map that relates local field regions to local regions of the optic disc as described in Section 3. When RNFL thickness in the superior and inferior arcuate sectors of the disc are plotted against SAP sensitivity loss (dB units) in the corresponding arcuate regions of the visual field, RNFL thickness becomes asymptotic for sensitivity losses greater than about 10dB. These data are well described by a simple linear model presented in Section 4. The model assumes that the RNFL thickness measured with OCT has two components. One component is the axons of the retinal ganglion cells and the other, the residual, is everything else (e.g. glial cells, blood vessels). The axon portion is assumed to decrease in a linear fashion with losses in SAP sensitivity (in linear units); the residual portion is assumed to remain constant. Based upon severe SAP losses in anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), the residual RNFL thickness in the arcuate regions is, on average, about one-third of the premorbid (normal) thickness of that region. The model also predicts that, to a first approximation, SAP sensitivity in control subjects does not depend upon RNFL thickness. The data (Section 6) are, in general, consistent with this prediction showing a very weak correlation between RNFL thickness and SAP sensitivity. In Section 7, the model is used to estimate the proportion of patients showing statistical abnormalities (worse than the 5th percentile) on the OCT RNFL test before they show abnormalities on the 24-2 SAP field test. Ignoring measurement error, the patients with a relatively thick RNFL, when healthy, will be more likely to show significant SAP sensitivity loss before statistically significant OCT RNFL loss, while the reverse will be true for those who start with an average or a relatively thin RNFL when healthy. Thus, it is important to understand the implications of the wide variation in RNFL thickness among control subjects. Section 8 describes two of the factors contributing to this variation, variations in the position of blood vessels and variations in the mapping of field regions to disc sectors. Finally, in Sections 7 and 9, the findings are related to the general debate in the literature about the relationship between structural and functional glaucomatous damage and a framework is proposed for understanding what is meant by the question, 'Does structural damage precede functional damage in glaucoma?' An emphasis is placed upon the need to distinguish between ""statistical"" and ""relational"" meanings of this question."
CD008803,0,25262916,0,Choroidal impairment and macular thinning in patients with systemic sclerosis: the acute study.,"Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a reversible vasospastic response of the extremities to cold or emotion, and can be the first manifestation or may be present before the development of an overt systemic sclerosis (SSc). The disturbance of the balance between vasodilation and vasoconstriction is not limited to the peripheral microcirculation of the skin, but it is also observed in other organs, such as the choroidal plexus of the eye. We aimed to examine the choroidal thickness (CT), the macular thickness and ganglion cell complex (GCC) average in thirty consecutive patients, without visual symptoms, classified as primary RP (pRP), RP secondary to suspected SSc, and overt SSc. All the patients underwent rheumatologic and ophthalmologic examination, capillaroscopy, test for anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA, and anti-extractable nuclear antigens. Ophthalmologic examination included: best corrected visual acuity; slit lamp biomicroscopy; intraocular pressure measurements, fundus examination, and Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) with enhanced depth imaging scan system. Twenty-seven healthy subjects similar for gender and age were analyzed. In pRP, CT was significantly thinner than controls in the outer nasal and temporal regions. In secondary RP, the inner and outer nasal areas were significantly thinner than controls. In SSc, the central, inner inferior, inner nasal, inner superior, outer temporal, outer inferior, and outer nasal regions were significantly thinner than controls. A decreasing trend of central foveal thickness was noted. All the patients had GCC average significantly lower than controls. A thinning of choroidal and macular thickness, as well as of GCC was observed in patients with pRP and becomes more severe and extensive in RP secondary to suspected SSc and overt SSc. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the choroidal features using SD-OCT in RP. These data may be clinically useful in suggesting an early involvement of ocular microcirculation with significant reduction of choroidal perfusion."

CD008803,0,18443609,0,Measuring and interpreting ocular blood flow and metabolism in glaucoma.,"There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that vascular dysfunction is related to several prominent ophthalmic diseases, including glaucoma. The vast majority of studies providing data on ocular circulation and disease pathophysiology use a relatively small number of complicated ocular blood flow imaging techniques. Although these imaging technologies are not commonly used in clinical settings, understanding the medical literature characterizing ocular blood flow requires familiarity with their methodology and function. This review highlights the imaging technologies most commonly used to investigate ocular blood flow, including color Doppler imaging, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopic angiography with fluorescein and indocyanine green dye, Canon laser blood flowmetry, scanning laser Doppler flowmetry, and retinal photographic oximetry. Each imaging technique's ability to define vascular function and reveal pathology is discussed as are limitations inherent to each technology. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide the physician with a clinically relevant foundation for differentiating the various ocular blood flow outcome measures often presented in the literature and determine how they are related to ocular health and disease."
CD008803,0,14566623,0,"Correlation between morphological and functional retinal impairment in patients affected by ocular hypertension, glaucoma, demyelinating optic neuritis and Alzheimer's disease.","In this article the correlations between the morphological evaluation of the nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness (by OCT) and retinal functional assessment (by Pattern ERG recordings) performed in patients affected by ocular hypertension (OHT), glaucoma (OAG), demyelinating optic neuritis (MSON), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are reported. In OHT eyes with ocular hypertension we observed that the inter-individual variation in NFL thickness is correlated with the variability of the PERG responses (the thinner the layer, the worse the visual function). In our OAG, MSON and AD eyes we observed a significant reduction in NFL thickness when compared with controls. In OHT, OAG, MSON and AD eyes abnormal PERG responses with delayed implicit times and reduced amplitudes were found. The impairment in the PERG parameters was significantly correlated to the reduction in NFL thickness. Our results suggest that in patients affected by ocular hypertension, glaucoma, demyelinating optic neuritis, and Alzheimer's Disease there is a reduction of NFL thickness evaluated ""in vivo"" by OCT, and this morphological involvement is correlated with electrophysiological responses assumed to be originating from the innermost retinal layers."
CD008803,0,8124023,0,[Comparison of two laser scanning tomography systems for three-dimensional analysis of the optic papilla].,"The Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) allows three-dimensional topographic analysis of the optic disc based on the same confocal laser tomographic scanning principle as the laser tomographic scanner (LTS). We evaluated the reproducibility attained with the HRT and compared the data acquired with the two instruments. To determine the reproducibility of the data acquisition with the HRT, we measured 27 glaucomatous discs five times each. The mean standard deviation was 0.075 mm2 for the cup area, 0.035 mm3 for the cup volume and 0.018 mm for the mean cup depth. In addition, 50 eyes were examined with both instruments. Measurements of the optic disc area and cup area demonstrated slightly increased values obtained with the HRT (mean difference 4.1% and 6.6%, respectively), while the values for cup volume and cup depth were 15.5% and 13.9% larger than those obtained with the LTS. The comparison between LTS and HRT demonstrates good agreement of the reproducibility concerning three-dimensional topometric data relating to the optic nerve head. The differences between the measurements may be due to a modified optical pathway enabling direct assessment of the intraocular focus position in the HRT. In conclusion, the improved and simplified method of laser scanning tomography as used in the HRT yields reproducible and reliable measurements of the optic nerve head. In addition, this instrument makes it possible to obtain high-quality images without pupil dilatation with a significantly shorter examination time."

CD008803,0,21164686,0,Longitudinal study of retinal degeneration in a rat using spectral domain optical coherence tomography.,"Rodent models of retinal degenerative diseases are used by vision scientists to develop therapies and to understand mechanisms of disease progression. Measurement of changes to the thickness of the various retinal layers provides an objective metric to evaluate the performance of the therapy. Because invasive histology is terminal and provides only a single data point, non-invasive imaging modalities are required to better study progression, and to reduce the number of animals used in research. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has emerged as a dominant imaging modality for human ophthalmic imaging, but has only recently gained significant attention for rodent retinal imaging. OCT provides cross section images of retina with micron-scale resolution which permits measurement of the retinal layer thickness. However, in order to be useful to vision scientists, a significant fraction of the retinal surface needs to be measured. In addition, because the retinal thickness normally varies as a function of distance from optic nerve head, it is critical to sample all regions of the retina in a systematic fashion. We present a longitudinal study of OCT to measure retinal degeneration in rats which have undergone optic nerve axotomy, a well characterized form of rapid retinal degeneration. Volumetric images of the retina acquired with OCT in a time course study were segmented in 2D using a semi-automatic segmentation algorithm. Then, using a 3D algorithm, thickness measurements were quantified across the surface of the retina for all volume segmentations. The resulting maps of the changes to retinal thickness over time represent the progression of degeneration across the surface of the retina during injury. The computational tools complement OCT retinal volumetric acquisition, resulting in a powerful tool for vision scientists working with rodents."

CD008803,0,18056739,0,An investigation of the retinal nerve fibre layer in progressive multiple sclerosis using optical coherence tomography.,"Axonal loss is thought to be the predominant cause of disability in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). The retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) is composed largely of unmyelinated axons of retinal ganglion cells, and is accessible to study with optical coherence tomography (OCT), giving a measure of axonal loss. OCT measures of the RNFL thickness (RNFLT) and macular volume were studied in 23 patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (primary progressive MS) (13 male; 10 female; mean age 52 years; median EDSS 6.0; mean disease duration 11 years), and 27 patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (secondary progressive MS) (8 male; 19 female; mean age 50 years; median EDSS 6; mean disease duration 22 years). Of the patients with secondary progressive MS, 14 had clinical history of optic neuritis (ON) in a single eye; the remaining patients had not had ON. Twenty healthy controls (11 male; 9 female; mean age 46 years) had RNFLT and macular volume studied. Of the patients' eyes not previously affected by ON, both the mean RNFL thickness and macular volume were reduced when compared with control values. The mean RNFL thickness and macular volume were significantly reduced in secondary progressive MS, but not in primary progressive MS when compared with control RNFL thickness and macular volume. RNFL loss was most evident in the temporal quadrant, where significant reduction was seen in primary progressive MS versus controls and in secondary versus primary progressive MS. There were significant correlations of decreased RNFLT and macular volume with measures of visual acuity, low contrast visual acuity and visual field mean deviation in the MS patients. There are significant global reductions in RNFLT and macular volume in the eyes of secondary progressive MS patients not previously affected by ON, but not in primary progressive MS patients, compared with controls. This may indicate a difference in the extent of the pathological processes that cause axonal loss in the retina, and by inference the optic nerve, in secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS."

The visual system, in addition to being of tremendous inherent importance, is unique in a very distinctive way; it possesses an organ - the eye - having a window allowing its interior to be examined with exquisite precision and control in both laboratory and clinical settings. Plus, many diseases manifest in the eye or are exclusive to the eye. This special issue of Current Eye Research contains 12 review articles, each addressing a different topical area important for Sex, Eyes, and Vision: Male/Female Distinctions in Ophthalmic Disorders. Of course, the distinctions between topical areas are blurred, and the overlap between the various lines of knowledge and investigation likewise is substantial. Eye diseases can be both neurodegenerative and involve altered blood flow, for instance. In fact, the thematic overlap is greater yet, in that the articles for this special issue address matters of interest to clinicians and scientists who may identify more with women's health or sex & gender fields than with eye & vision fields. Nevertheless, because this special issue needs a home, the following 12 topical areas each have here their own dedicated review: age-related maculopathy, central nervous system function and cognition & perception, diabetic retinopathy, dry eye, glaucoma, inherited diseases, lens and cataract, neuro-ophthalmology, ocular blood flow, ocular inflammatory disorders, optical coherence tomography, and sex/gender eye care disparities.

CD008803,0,6670063,0,Glaucoma screening in the health care setting.,"Glaucoma surveys are an important means of detecting early cases of glaucoma. Traditionally, most such surveys have been conducted in the community, while the health care setting has been underutilized as a screening location. We reviewed studies on surveys conducted in community and health care settings, using tonometry and ophthalmoscopy, and presented data from a study we carried out in the outpatient department of a hospital. Results of our review indicate that over 11 times as many people were screened in the community studies as in the health care studies, but the latter had the higher percentage of referrals. Data from the literature review, as well as from our own study, suggest that the high number of referrals is related to the characteristics of the population available for screening in a health care facility. In such a population there is a higher percentage of individuals at risk for development of glaucoma. Risk factors for the disease include age, sex (males more at risk than females), race, (blacks more at risk than whites), family history of glaucoma, and presence of diabetes and vascular diseases. It was also found that ophthalmoscopy is an effective, but underutilized, method of screening. We recommend an increase in use of health care facilities as sites of glaucoma screening surveys. We also suggest that physicians employ ophthalmoscopy to screen for glaucoma as part of the routine funduscopic examination."

Most significant alterations were observed in the anterior disjunction zone. Its thickness was increased in all these diseases with the exception of the glaucoma eyes treated with derivates of phenylephrine and/or cholinesteraseinhibitors. Under these conditions the disjunction zone disappeared. The alterations of the lens cortex and of the nucleus of the lens with respect to the thickness and its density were mostly accelerations of the normal aging process and only glaucoma eyes were partly in contrast to this process. Thickening of the anterior disjunction zone may be combined with a thickening of the whole lens and vice versa."
CD008803,0,23775932,0,Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and visual hallucinations in Parkinson's Disease.,"Defective visual information processing from both central and peripheral pathways is one of the suggested mechanisms of visual hallucination in Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate the role of retinal thinning for visual hallucination in PD, we conducted a case-control study using spectral domain optical coherence tomography. We examined a representative sample of 61 patients with PD and 30 healthy controls who had no history of ophthalmic diseases. General ophthalmologic examinations and optical coherence tomography scans were performed in each participant. Total macular thickness and the thickness of each retinal layer on horizontal scans through the fovea were compared between the groups. In a comparison between patients with PD and healthy controls, there was significant parafoveal inner nuclear layer thinning, whereas other retinal layers, including the retinal nerve fiber layer, as well as total macular thicknesses were not different. In terms of visual hallucinations among the PD subgroups, only retinal nerve fiber layer thickness differed significantly, whereas total macular thickness and the thickness of other retinal layers did not differ. The retinal nerve fiber layer was thinnest in the group that had hallucinations without dementia, followed by the group that had hallucinations with dementia, and the group that had no hallucinations and no dementia. General ophthalmologic examinations did not reveal any significant correlation with hallucinations. There were no significant correlations between retinal thicknesses and duration or severity of PD and medication dosages. The results indicate that retinal nerve fiber layer thinning may be related to visual hallucination in nondemented patients with PD. Replication studies as well as further studies to elucidate the mechanism of thinning are warranted."

CD008803,0,21601065,0,Abnormalities of the optic disc.,"The optic disc represents the anterior end of the optic nerve, the most forward extension of the central nervous system (CNS). The optic disc gives a rare glimpse into the CNS. Hence, diseases of the CNS are often manifested on fundus examination. Abnormalities of the optic disc may reflect eye disease (such as glaucoma), problems in development (as in various syndromes), or CNS disease (such as increased intracranial pressure). Each optic nerve is composed of about 1.2 million axons deriving from the retinal ganglion cells of one eye. Optic atrophy is a morphological sequela reflecting the loss of many or all of these axons. Myriad diseases such as hereditary, metabolic, tumor, and increased intracranial pressure can lead to optic atrophy. Some diseases, such as optic disc drusen, intracranial masses, orbital tumors, ischemic optic neuropathies, inflammations, and infiltrations, can produce optic disc edema before leading to optic atrophy. A number of new imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), quantitate the thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer as an indirect measure of axonal loss or swelling. OCT can therefore be used to quantitate pathology or the response to therapy in various generalized CNS conditions, such as multiple sclerosis."

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive procedure that can quickly acquire high-resolution cross-sectional images of the ocular structure and is used widely in ophthalmic clinics. In terms of glaucoma, OCT is used to measure the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer, the structure of the optic disc, the loss of retinal ganglion cells, the parameters of anterior chamber and anterior chamber angle, the thickness of the iris, the thickness of the lens, the thickness of the choroid, the structure of the filtration bleb and so on.

CD008803,0,18351532,0,[Anterior segment optical coherence tomography in glaucoma].,"In recent years, the rapid development of diagnostic optic devices has generated optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a new, non-invasive diagnostic method. With technical progress of the infrared spectrum at 1,310 nm, OCT of the anterior segment also became feasible. With anterior segment OCT different examinations which so far were ruled out by ultrasound in contact manner could be executed in a non-contact technique: pachymetry, goniometry, illustration of iris and lens configuration as well as postoperative results after different glaucoma surgeries such as trabeculectomy, deep sclerectomy and glaucoma drainage devices. Additionally, anterior segment OCT provides an imaging device for experimental approaches in glaucoma. Today two commercially available units are available: SL OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) und Visante(R) OCT (Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany). For all applications OCT delivered a high inter- and intraobserver reproducibility, is equal to ultrasound in accuracy and involves a higher patient comfort. Within the different applications, a direct comparison with ultrasound technique reveals minor differences depending on the device type. Therefore, it is advised to indicate the device type with all measurements. OCT enables precise, two-dimensional, non-contact imaging of the anterior segment in high resolution. For glaucomatous diseases, anterior segment OCT enlarges and enriches the armamentarium of glaucoma diagnostics and postoperative care of current modern glaucoma surgery."

CD008803,0,16689260,0,Automatic recovery of the optic nervehead geometry in optical coherence tomography.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) uses retroreflected light to provide micrometer-resolution, cross-sectional scans of biological tissues. OCT's first application was in ophthalmic imaging where it has proven particularly useful in diagnosing, monitoring, and studying glaucoma. Diagnosing glaucoma is difficult and it often goes undetected until significant damage to the subject's visual field has occurred. As glaucoma progresses, neural tissue dies, the nerve fiber layer thins, and the cup-to-disk ratio increases. Unfortunately, most current measurement techniques are subjective and inherently unreliable, making it difficult to monitor small changes in the nervehead geometry. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first published results on optic nervehead segmentation and geometric characterization from OCT data. We develop complete, autonomous algorithms based on a parabolic model of cup geometry and an extension of the Markov model introduced by Koozekanani, et al. to segment the retinal-nervehead surface, identify the choroid-nervehead boundary, and identify the extent of the optic cup. We present thorough experimental results from both normal and pathological eyes, and compare our results against those of an experienced, expert ophthalmologist, reporting a correlation coefficient for cup diameter above 0.8 and above 0.9 for the disk diameter."

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has begun to be utilized as an adjunctive, quantitative tool in the evaluation of patients with IIH to help distinguish between true optic nerve head edema and pseudopapilledema, and to contribute to our understanding of the consequences of prolonged optic nerve edema. Although few longitudinal studies of patients with IIH have been published to date, it appears that there may be a correlation between retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and visual function. With the new spectral domain OCT, additional parameters of the optic nerve imaging, including volume and height measurements, might provide greater sensitivity of the response to treatment and the long-term visual outcome in patients with IIH."

All had applanation pressures of 18 mm Hg or less. There was no linear relationship (covariation) between cup-disk ratio and refractive error or intraocular pressure, but there was a tendency toward increasing cup-disk ratio with increasing age. The mean cup-disk ratio in the group examined with the Hruby lens was 0.38 and that in the group examined with the direct ophthalmoscope was 0.25. With either method almost all eyes had cup-disk ratios of 0.7 or less. In 9% of the eyes the cup was ovoid. In only 10% of these cases was the vertical cup-disk ratio greater than the horizontal cup-disk ratio, and in only one case was this difference 0.2 or more. The Hruby lens method consistently gave a slightly larger cup-disk ratio than the direct ophthalmoscope did. However, there was seldom a disparity of more than 0.2. The Hruby lens or biomicroscopic lens should be used to determine the fullest extent of the contour of the cup. Any cup-disk ratio of 0.7 or more, any vertical cup-disk ratio larger than the horizontal cup-disk ratio, and any disparity between the direct ophthalmoscope estimation and Hruby lens estimation of more than 0.2 should be viewed with suspicion."
CD008803,0,22595776,0,Ocular sarcoidosis.,"Sarcoidosis, a chronic multisystem disease, is a common cause of ocular inflammation. Even though clinical features are well-established, diagnosis requires histological confirmation, which remains difficult in patients with uveitis. Thus, the frequency of ocular sarcoidosis is overestimated. A set of criteria has been recently established in order to improve the diagnostic procedure. New imaging tools will enable the ophthalmologist to evaluate the level of ocular inflammation and to monitor its resolution after treatment initiation. Indocyanine green angiography and optical coherence tomography have dramatically improved our understanding of choroidal granulomas and macular edema. Treatment is based on topical and systemic corticosteroids in most of the cases, but immuno-suppressive agents may be necessary. The visual outcome remains favorable but severe complications, including glaucoma, cystoid macular edema and choroidal neovascularization, may need a prompt and aggressive management."

CD008803,0,22042009,0,Diagnosis of uveal melanoma.,"The diagnosis of uveal melanoma is based on clinical examination with the slit lamp and indirect ophthalmoscope together with ultrasonography of the eye. Large to medium-sized melanomas are reliably diagnosed using these methods. The challenge lies in early detection. Small melanomas are more difficult to tell from presumed naevi. A useful mnemonic 'to find small ocular melanomas' reminds the general ophthalmologist to look for tumour thickness of more than 2 mm, subretinal fluid, visual symptoms, orange pigment and location of the tumour margin at the optic disc. Optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence imaging help in identifying subretinal fluid and orange pigment and in measuring the thickness of thin choroidal tumours. Each of the risk characteristics roughly doubles the likelihood of growth so that the risk for growth is about 30 times higher when all five characteristics are present as compared to their absence. In addition, a low acoustic profile, the absence of a halo around the tumour and the absence of drusen over it increase the likelihood of growth. Patients with a choroidal melanocytic tumour with at least one risk characteristic benefit from referral to an ocular oncologist. We recommend that the rest of the patients be made aware of their presumed naevus and that they should be observed periodically. The patients should also be told to return immediately if they develop new visual symptoms. Finally, the trend is toward taking a biopsy of suspicious small choroidal tumours as an alternative to documenting growth before treating them as melanomas."

CD008803,0,10150863,0,Optical coherence tomography: a new tool for glaucoma diagnosis.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel technique that allows cross-sectional imaging of the anterior and posterior eye. OCT has a resolution of approximately 10 microns, with extremely high sensitivity (approximately 10(-10) of incident light). OCT is analogous to computed tomography, which uses x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, which uses spin resonance, or B-scan ultrasound, which uses sound waves, but OCT uses only light to derive its image. OCT is a noncontact, noninvasive system by which retinal substructure may be analyzed in vivo. OCT is useful in the evaluation of retinal pathologies and glaucoma. In retinal disease, entities such as macular holes, macular edema, central serous chorioretinopathy, retinal vascular occlusion and other factors have been examined. Separation between the posterior vitreous and retina, or lack thereof, are seen and quantitated. In glaucoma, retinal nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness is measured at standardized locations around the optic nerve head. A circular scan produces a cylindrical cross-section of the retina, from which the NFL can be analyzed. In addition, radial scans through the optic nerve head are used to evaluate cupping and juxtapapillary NFL thickness. OCT, a new imaging technology by which the anterior and posterior segment are seen in cross-section, may permit the early diagnosis of glaucoma, and the early detection of glaucomatous progression."

Prentice Award Lecture 2006: a neuron doctrine for glaucoma.,"The glaucomas are a group of potentially blinding optic neuropathies that are characterized by progressive pathological losses of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons that form the optic nerve. The causes are unknown and, therefore, the diagnosis and assessment of progression of disease depends on ophthalmic testing to identify and quantify clinical characteristics of glaucomatous neuropathy, such as the pattern of visual field defects and/or thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer. To relate these clinical measurements to the basic pathology of glaucoma, a neuron doctrine for glaucoma has been proposed to correlate data from standard tests (standard automated perimetry and optical coherence tomography) to the loss of RGCs. The doctrine was derived through initial laboratory studies of experimental glaucoma in macaque monkeys and, then, modified and refined though patient-based clinical investigations. The final formulation of the doctrine produced concordance between subjective and objective measurements when the results were translated to their common parameter of RGCs, for both normal vision and defective vision from glaucoma. Thus, it was concluded that for individual patients, alterations in structure-function relationships usually should be in agreement for the degree and location of visual field defects caused by glaucoma."

CD008803,0,1390528,0,Confocal imaging of the fundus using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope.,"A confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO) was used to examine the effects of confocal optics on the image of the human fundus in vivo. Patients from a retinal clinic and a glaucoma clinic were examined using the cSLO in the confocal mode. A degree of optical sectioning could be achieved, and the results agree with a best axial resolution of 300 microns measured in a model eye. The main advantage of using a confocal system was found to be the improved contrast of the images. This improved the resolution of structures such as the lamina cribrosa and optic disc drusen which are seen in low contrast in conventional images. The improved contrast of the confocal images is partly achieved by excluding light which has been scattered within the plane of focus. Structures which multiply scatter light will become less visible with confocal optics and hard exudates were found to be an example of such a structure. The cSLO and the fundus camera are seen as complementary instruments rather than as alternatives for imaging the fundus. It is envisaged that confocal imaging will enable details of the fundus to be revealed which are at present not seen in conventional images."

CD008803,0,12585706,0,Digital stereo image analyzer for generating automated 3-D measures of optic disc deformation in glaucoma.,"The major limitations of precise evaluation of retinal structures in present clinical situations are the lack of standardization, the inherent subjectivity involved in the interpretation of retinal images, and intra- as well as interobserver variability. While evaluating optic disc deformation in glaucoma, these limitations could be overcome by using advanced digital image analysis techniques to generate precise metrics from stereo optic disc image pairs. A digital stereovision system for visualizing the topography of the optic nerve head from stereo optic disc images is presented. We have developed an algorithm, combining power cepstrum and zero-mean-normalized cross correlation techniques, which extracts depth information using coarse-to-fine disparity between corresponding windows in a stereo pair. The gray level encoded sparse disparity matrix is subjected to a cubic B-spline operation to generate smooth representations of the optic cup/disc surfaces and new three-dimensional (3-D) metrics from isodisparity contours. Despite the challenges involved in 3-D surface recovery, the robustness of our algorithm in finding disparities within the constraints used has been validated using stereo pairs with known disparities. In a preliminary longitudinal study of glaucoma patients, a strong correlation is found between the computer-generated quantitative cup/disc volume metrics and manual metrics commonly used in a clinic. The computer generated new metrics, however, eliminate the subjective variability and greatly reduce the time and cost involved in manual metric generation in follow-up studies of glaucoma."

Spontaneous remission occurred in one eye, the eye with least drug exposure, within a few weeks. The other eye continued to show evidence of elevated intraocular pressure and further field loss developed over 4 years after discontinuation of the steroid. The most serverly affected eye became myopic. This case strongly suggests that chronic application of flurandrenolide into the conjuctival sac can produce corticosteroid-induced glaucoma in susceptible individuals. Although both eyes were normal before exposure to the steroid and elevations of the same level developed in both eyes at the peak of the disease, the eye with the least drug exposure underwent complete and spontaneous remission whereas the eye exposed more frequently appeared to show irreversible changes in the aqueous humor outflow pathway with subsequent loss of visual field."

METHODS Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volumes were obtained from 116 eyes in 58 consecutive patients with glaucoma or suspected glaucoma. Layer and optic nerve head (ONH) analysis was performed; the mean regional retinal ganglion cell layer thickness (68 regions), nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness (120 regions), and ONH rim area (12 wedge-shaped regions) were determined. Maps of RGC-AC connectivity were created using maximum correlation between regions' ganglion cell layer thickness, NFL thickness, and ONH rim area; for retinal nerve fiber bundle regions, the maximum ""thickness correlation paths"" were determined. RESULTS The mean (SD) NFL thickness and ganglion cell layer thickness across all macular regions were 22.5 (7.5) μm and 33.9 (8.4) μm, respectively. The mean (SD) rim area across all ONH wedge regions was 0.038 (0.004) mm2. Connectivity maps were obtained successfully and showed typical nerve fiber bundle connectivity of the RGC-AC cell body segment to the initial NFL axonal segment, of the initial to the final RGC-AC NFL axonal segments, of the final RGC-AC NFL axonal to the ONH axonal segment, and of the RGC-AC cell body segment to the ONH axonal segment. CONCLUSIONS In early glaucoma, the amount and distribution of glaucomatous damage along the entire RGC-AC can be quantified and mapped using automated image analysis of standard spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Our findings should contribute to better detection and improved management of glaucoma."

The study group consisted of 78 patients with type 2 DM (patient group) and age-sex matched 50 healthy subjects (control group). All patients and controls underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination, automated perimetry, central corneal thickness (CCT) measurement and OD topography by using HRT II. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of the diabetic patients were also noted. Age, gender, intraocular pressure and CCT measurements were similar in patients with diabetes and control group. Mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (MRNFLT) and retinal nerve fiber layer cross-sectional area (RNFLcsA) parameters were found significantly lower in diabetic patients compared to those of the controls (p = 0.030, p = 0.038). In the patient group, MRNFLT value was found significantly lower in patients with DM duration ≥120 months (p = 0.020) and HbA1c level ≥7 % (p = 0.029). Rim volume, MRNFLT and RNFLcsA values were significantly lower in proliferative diabetic retinopathy group (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, p = 0.001 respectively) and laser treated patients (p = 0.003, p = 0.002, p = 0.004 respectively). In conclusion, poor metabolic control of diabetes, severe DR and received laser therapies cause RNFL damage.

CD008803,0,24111450,0,Automated anterior chamber angle localization and glaucoma type classification in OCT images.,"To identify glaucoma type with OCT (optical coherence tomography) images, we present an image processing and machine learning based framework to localize and classify anterior chamber angle (ACA) accurately and efficiently. In digital OCT photographs, our method automatically localizes the ACA region, which is the primary structural image cue for clinically identifying glaucoma type. Next, visual features are extracted from this region to classify the angle as open angle (OA) or angle-closure (AC). This proposed method has three major contributions that differ from existing methods. First, the ACA localization from OCT images is fully automated and efficient for different ACA configurations. Second, it can directly classify ACA as OA/AC based on only visual features, which is different from previous work for ACA measurement that relies on clinical features. Third, it demonstrates that higher dimensional visual features outperform low dimensional clinical features in terms of angle closure classification accuracy. From tests on a clinical dataset comprising of 2048 images, the proposed method only requires 0.26s per image. The framework achieves a 0.921 ± 0.036 AUC (area under curve) value and 84.0% ± 5.7% balanced accuracy at a 85% specificity, which outperforms existing methods based on clinical features."

However, the high axial resolution of OCT makes it very sensitive to the pulsatile bulk motion noise in the axial direction. To overcome this limitation, we developed split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of flow detection. The full OCT spectrum was split into several narrower bands. Inter-B-scan decorrelation was computed using the spectral bands separately and then averaged. The SSADA algorithm was tested on in vivo images of the human macula and optic nerve head. It significantly improved both SNR for flow detection and connectivity of microvascular network when compared to other amplitude-decorrelation algorithms."

Twenty-four patients with GS (BCVA 20/20, normal visual field, intraocular pressure, IOP, less than 21 mmHg, and glaucomatous optic neuropathy, GON) and 14 patients with OHT (BCVA 20/20, intraocular pressure 25 mmHg, absence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy and normal visual field) were considered in this study. GON was intended as vertical cup-disk ratio of 0.5 or more; asymmetry of greater than 0.2, disk notching, disk splinter hemorrhages. PERGLA amplitude and phase were measured, while thickness of the RNFL was obtained with spectral OCT. A control group of 50 age-matched healthy patients was added. In the GS group, 16 eyes (66.7%) showed normal average RNFL analysis and normal PERGLA, 3 eyes (12.5%) showed abnormal average RNFL analysis and abnormal PERGLA, 5 eyes (20.8%) presented with normal average RNFL analysis and abnormal PERGLA. In the OHT group, 11 eyes (78.6%) showed an average normal RNFL and normal PERGLA, while 3 eyes (21.4%) presented with an average normal RNFL and abnormal PERGLA. PERGLA is a non-invasive, fast, and fully automatic version of the pattern ERG. In eyes with OHT and in eyes with GS, PERGLA abnormalities in presence of a normal RNFL could suggest an early functional damage of viable retinal ganglion cells."

CD008803,0,19737875,0,Optic disc morphology in open-angle glaucoma compared with anterior ischemic optic neuropathies.,"Purpose. To compare optic disc topography performed by confocal laser ophthalmoscopy in eyes with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION), and open-angle glaucoma (OAG), adjusting for the amount of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss, as measured by nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness and average visual field loss. Methods. At four referral centers, patients who met specific diagnostic criteria for OAG (103 persons, 152 eyes), NAION (53 persons, 57 eyes), or AAION (18 persons, 20 eyes) underwent Heidelberg Retinal Tomography (HRT; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), Stratus Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA), and Humphrey visual field testing (HFA; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc.). HRT parameters were compared in univariate and multivariate models, accounting for degree of RGC loss by either OCT NFL thickness or visual field mean deviation (MD). Acute AION occurred at least 6 weeks before testing. Results. After adjustment for degree of injury according to either MD or mean NFL thickness, all HRT parameters were significantly different between OAG and both NAION and AAION. With similar damage, OAG eyes had larger, deeper cups; smaller rims; more cup volume; and less rim volume (all P < or = 0.001). There were differences in disc topography between NAION and AAION, but they were not consistent for both measures of damage. Disc area and MD were also significantly associated with many HRT parameters. NFL thickness was greater at the same MD for both AAION and NAION compared with OAG. Conclusions. NAION and AAION cause loss of RGCs, but have significantly different disc topography compared with OAG at a given level of RGC loss."

Twenty-one eyes of 21 male CRF patients aged between 46 and 80 years were included in this prospective study. Retinal and choroidal thicknesses of the patients were measured using high-resolution OCT line scans with the activated enhanced depth imaging mode before and shortly after haemodialysis. Retinal and choroidal thickness measurements were taken at the fovea and at two points that were 1,500 μm nasal and temporal to the fovea. The relationships between the haemodynamic changes, intraocular pressure (IOP) and central corneal thickness (CCT) were also evaluated. The mean choroidal thicknesses before haemodialysis at the subfoveal, temporal and nasal locations were 232.81 ± 71.92, 212.43 ± 70.50 and 182.14 ± 68.88 μm, respectively. The mean choroidal thicknesses after haemodialysis at the subfoveal, temporal and nasal locations were 210.90 ± 65.53, 195.38 ± 66.48 and 165.19 ± 66.73 μm, respectively. There were significant differences between the choroidal thicknesses before and after haemodialysis (p < 0.001 for all). The mean retinal thicknesses before haemodialysis at the foveal, temporal and nasal locations were 215.86 ± 41.06, 308.86 ± 37.73 and 338.00 ± 33.32 μm, respectively. The mean retinal thicknesses after haemodialysis at the foveal, temporal and nasal locations were 216.90 ± 39.70, 313.86 ± 32.89 and 335.29 ± 36.85 μm, respectively. There was no significant difference between the retinal thicknesses before and after haemodialysis (p > 0.05 for all). The mean CCT decreased insignificantly from 550.48 ± 17.46 to 548.10 ± 21.12 μm (p = 0.411). The mean IOP decreased significantly from 14.09 ± 2.58 to 12.54 ± 2.23 mmHg (p = 0.003), which did not correlate with the CCT [r = (-)0.134, p = 0.562].

The data are analyzed in terms of spherical harmonics. It is hypothesized that the shape of the cup of the optic nerve head for a normal eye can be parameterized by a specific set of spherical harmonic coefficients and is different from the set of coefficients describing a glaucomatous eye. The sets of coefficients are analyzed by using multivariate statistics and can in turn be used to classify new observations. Preliminary results indicate that there are significant differences in the coefficients and that the procedure might have potential as a diagnostic aid for the detection or the screening of glaucoma.

The coefficient of variation of three repeated measurements in a model eye and in volunteers and the relative error in a model eye was calculated. With ONHA measurements the pooled coefficient of variation in volunteers was 9.3% in measuring cup areas and 8.4% in measuring the cup volume. In a model eye the pooled coefficient of variation was 7.6% for the parameter 'cup area' and 9.9% for the parameter 'cup volume'. The pooled relative error in the model eye was 6.6% for the parameter 'cup area' and 5.1% for the parameter 'cup volume'. With HRT measurements in volunteers the pooled coefficient of variation of both the parameters 'volume below contour' and 'volume below surface' was 6.9%. In the model eye the pooled coefficient of variation was 2.4% for the 'volume below contour' and 4.1% for the parameter 'volume below surface'. The pooled relative error in the model eye was 11.3% for the 'volume below contour' and 11% for the 'volume below surface'. The pooled relative error in measuring retinal elevations in the model eye was 3.8%. The coefficient of variation was 3.5%. The accuracies of the HRT and ONHA were similar. However, as the ONHA 'cup volume' is unreliable in patients because of the design of the ONHA whereas the HRT volume parameters are reliable it seems reasonable to assume that the HRT is superior to the ONHA. Only the HRT is capable of quantifying retinal elevations."

Technical difficulties such as large cups or papillary dysversions should be well known and the results should be analyzed carefully. OCT evaluation is particularly helpful for glaucoma screening or for preperimetric glaucoma.

None of the cases we treated presented complications induced by radiotherapy (actinic papillitis, circulatory disturbances in the macular area, or neovascular glaucoma). The comparison of the results we obtained with cases treated by photocoagulation or external radiotherapy demonstrated a slight advantage in favour of the focalized radiotherapy, which is not statistically significant because of the small number of cases included in the studies.

All patients were examined with the Octopus 101 automated perimetry dG2 program using the dynamic/normal strategy (white-on-white perimetry, W/WP), with the dG2 program using the dynamic strategy/BY method (blue-on-yellow perimetry, B/YP), and with GDx VCC. Seven of the 52 OHT patients had both B/YP visual field loss and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defects with the GDx VCC measurements, and four patients demonstrated regions of B/YP visual field defects with corresponding RNFL defects on GDx VCC examination. A mild significant correlation was found between B/YP mean sensitivity (MS) and the superior average (R (2) =0.138, p = 0.049). No significant correlation was found between the W/WP indices and GDx VCC parameters. B/YP MS correlated with the superior average of GDx VCC in OHT patients. The findings brought up the possibility of using both techniques for clinical examination to yield converging data."

CD008803,0,21934782,0,Assessment of corneal dynamics with high-speed swept source optical coherence tomography combined with an air puff system.,"We present a novel method and instrument for in vivo imaging and measurement of the human corneal dynamics during an air puff. The instrument is based on high-speed swept source optical coherence tomography (ssOCT) combined with a custom adapted air puff chamber from a non-contact tonometer, which uses an air stream to deform the cornea in a non-invasive manner. During the short period of time that the deformation takes place, the ssOCT acquires multiple A-scans in time (M-scan) at the center of the air puff, allowing observation of the dynamics of the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces as well as the anterior lens surface. The dynamics of the measurement are driven by the biomechanical properties of the human eye as well as its intraocular pressure. Thus, the analysis of the M-scan may provide useful information about the biomechanical behavior of the anterior segment during the applanation caused by the air puff. An initial set of controlled clinical experiments are shown to comprehend the performance of the instrument and its potential applicability to further understand the eye biomechanics and intraocular pressure measurements. Limitations and possibilities of the new apparatus are discussed."

Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) is a functional extension of OCT that can image birefringent properties of a biological sample. PS-OCT was used to measure and image retardation and birefringent axis orientation of in vitro human cornea. We used a two-channel PS-OCT system employing a phase-sensitive recording of the interferometric signals in two orthogonal polarization channels. Using an algorithm based on a Hilbert transform, it is possible to calculate the retardation and the slow axis orientation of the sample with only a single A-scan per transversal measurement location. While the retardation information is encoded in the amplitude ratio of the two interferometric signals, the axis orientation is encoded entirely in their phase difference. We present maps of retardation and the distribution of slow axis orientation of the human cornea in longitudinal cross-sections and en face images obtained at the back surface of the cornea. The retardation increases in a radial direction and with depth; the slow axis varies in the transversal direction. Knowledge of the retardation and the slow axis distribution of the cornea might improve nerve fiber polarimetry for glaucoma diagnostics and could be useful for diagnosing different types of pathologies of the cornea."
CD008803,0,23370602,0,The potential of annexin-labelling for the diagnosis and follow-up of glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in developed countries and is mainly attributable to the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Although several diagnostic tools have been developed to detect and monitor this disease, none has the requisite sensitivity to identify it at a preclinical stage or to perceive small changes in retinal health over short periods. Specifically, irreversible visual changes occur before neuronal damage is discovered. The most widely accepted in vitro assay for apoptotic cells involves the use of fluorescent annexin A5. The radiolabelling of this marker makes it possible to assess, in vivo and non-invasively, various diseases in which the apoptotic process is pivotal, such as myocardial infarction or tumour response to chemotherapy. Recently, a new technique has been developed to visualise directly individual RGCs undergoing apoptosis in the living eye. This DARC (detection of apoptosing retinal cells) technology uses fluorescently labelled annexin A5 to bind apoptosing retinal neurons and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy to detect the marked dying cells. Based on experimental models, DARC has been suggested to offer a direct and quantitative assessment of the retinal condition of patients. A Phase I clinical trial in glaucoma patients is scheduled to start shortly. This technology has the potential to pre-empt the diagnosis of glaucoma prior to visual deterioration, to provide an accurate numeric evaluation highlighting even small retinal changes and to allow the rapid judgement of the efficacy of both current and new therapeutic strategies."

CD008803,0,2730399,0,Simple photogrammetric diagnosis of optic nerve hypoplasia.,"It is often clinically important, but also often difficult, to make a definitive morphologic diagnosis of optic nerve hypoplasia in a young child. If, however, one can obtain a photograph of the fundus, including the optic disc, one can make a simple measurement of the horizontal diameter of the optic disc and make this diagnosis. To determine if the horizontal diameter of the optic disc on a 35-mm photographic transparency could be used to separate patients with optic nerve hypoplasia from normal individuals, I measured directly on the transparency the horizontal diameter of the optic disc image taken by a standard 30 degrees field fundus camera with X2.5 magnification in a series of 55 normal eyes, and in 16 eyes with clinically confirmed optic nerve hypoplasia. For the normal series of eyes, the mean optic disc horizontal image diameter was 3.88 mm, with a range of 3.44 to 4.70 mm. For the series of eyes with optic nerve hypoplasia, the mean horizontal diameter was 2.64 mm, with a range of 1.80 to 3.27 mm. There was no overlap between the normal control series and the pathologic series. In subjects with no major ametropia (less than 2.5 diopters of spherical or cylindrical refractive error), a 3.4-mm horizontal diameter optic disc image on a 35-mm transparency can be used as a clinical guide or dividing line for the diagnosis of optic nerve hypoplasia, larger nerves being considered normal and smaller nerves being considered hypoplastic."

CD008803,0,19356824,0,Tau inclusions in retinal ganglion cells of human P301S tau transgenic mice: effects on axonal viability.,"Tau inclusions play a key role in the pathogenesis of tauopathies. Altered tau levels have been detected in retina and optic nerve of patients with glaucoma, suggesting the possibility of shared pathogenic mechanisms with tauopathies. Here we report that hyperphosphorylated transgenic tau accumulates in the nerve fibre layer and, from 2 months of age, aggregates into filamentous inclusions in retinal ganglion cells of human P301S tau transgenic mice. Axonopathy and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the nerve fibre layer preceded inclusion formation. Hyperphosphorylated tau and tau inclusions were also detected in cultured retinal explants from 5-month-old transgenic mice. Axonal outgrowth was similar in transgenic and wild-type retinal explants under basal conditions. However, when exposed to growth-promoting stimuli, axon elongation was enhanced in explants from wild-type but not transgenic mice, indicating that the presence of abnormal tau can impair stimulated axonal outgrowth. These findings suggest that the retina is a good model system for investigating tau-driven neurodegeneration and for assessing potential pharmacological modifiers for tauopathies."

The quantitative 3-D reconstruction of the ONH is required for the diagnosis. We propose a technique to obtain the depth value from stereo image pair of a retinal fundus for the 3-D reconstruction of the ONH. Our technique mainly consists of four steps: (1) cutout of the ONH region from the fundus images, (2) registration of the stereo pair, (3) disparity detection, and (4) depth calculation. For quantitative estimation of the depth value measured by using this method, the depth value was compared with the measurement results determined from the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT), which is a confocal laser-scanning microscope. As a result, the depth value of the ONH obtained using the stereo retinal image pair was in accordance with that obtained using the HRT (r=0.91). These results indicate that the stereo fundus images could be useful for assessing the depth value of the ONH for the diagnosis of glaucoma."

CD008803,0,23748101,0,Neuroprotective effect of minocycline in a rat model of branch retinal vein occlusion.,"Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is the second most frequent retinal vascular disorder. Currently the first-line therapies for BRVO include anti-VEGF and dexamethasone implant treatment, however, with direct or indirect damage on retinal neurons, it has limited effect in improving patients visual acuity. Therefore, novel treatments with neuroprotective effect for BRVO retina were expected. Minocycline is a semisynthetic, broad spectrum tetracycline antibiotic with high penetration through the blood brain barrier. The neuroprotective effects of minocycline have been shown in various central nervous system (CNS) disease. Since both CNS and retina were composed of neurons and glials, it is reasonable to expect a neuroprotective effect by minocycline for BRVO retina. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to study whether minocycline has neuroprotective effect in branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and the possible underlying molecular basis. We created BRVO in rats using laser photocoagulation. The animals were then randomly divided into 4 groups to evaluate the effect of minocycline: group A: minocycline 45 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection (i.p.), group B: minocycline 90 mg/kg i.p., group C: normal saline i.p., group D: sham injection. Fundus photography and fluorescein angiography (FA) were conducted. The changes in thickness of retinal layers were measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT) in vivo. We found that retinal edema occurred predominantly in the inner retinal layers. Intraperitoneal administration of minocycline significantly ameliorated retinal edema in the early stage of BRVO. We performed Full field Electroretinography (ffERG) to evaluate retinal function and found that the reduction of b wave amplitude decreased in the combined maximal response. The expressional levels of apoptosis related genes (Bax, Bcl-2) and inflammation related genes (IL-1 β, TNF α, MCP-1 and CCR2) were measured by real-time PCR, the results showed that minocycline treatment upregulated Bcl-2 expression and inhibits TNF α expression since early stage of BRVO. We also performed Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and immunostaining for Iba 1 (a microgilal marker), active caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, IL-1 β, TNF α and found that minocycline inhibits retinal microglial activation, prevents retinal ganglion cell loss, and inhibits retinal caspase-3 activation. Thus, our study indicates that systemic administration of minocycline ameliorates retinal edema and preserves retinal function in the early stage of BRVO possibly via inhibiting microglia activation and protecting RGC from apoptosis."

CD008803,0,20522019,0,Optical coherence tomography for complete management of patients with diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy is a major complication of patients with diabetes mellitus and can lead to a decrease in vision. The precise mechanisms leading to the development of diabetic retinopathy and the progressive decrease of vision are still undetermined. Recent studies have shown that not only vascular but also neuronal abnormalities are associated with the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Because neuronal cell death leads to an irreversible decrease in visual function, early changes in the morphology and physiology of the neural retinas of diabetic patients are important. The alterations of the morphology of the retina can be obtained by high-resolution B-scan optical coherence tomography (OCT). The thickness of the macular area and retinal nerve fiber layer can be measured reliably and accurately by the installed software of OCT instruments. The high-resolution images can be used to evaluate diabetic macular edema and optic nerve damage quantitatively in patients with diabetic retinopathy. This review describes how the OCT measurements can be used to manage patients with diabetic retinopathy. We also present the early retinal changes involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy."

CD008803,0,21993619,0,New findings in the ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay.,"The aim of the study was to enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of the ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay, based on the findings presented herein. Five patients with a molecular diagnosis of this disease underwent clinical, radiological, ophthalmologic and electrophysiological examinations. Five novel mutations, which included nonsense and missense variants, were identified, with these resulting in milder phenotypes. In addition to the usual manifestations, a straight dorsal spine was found in every case, and imaging techniques showed loss of the dorsal kyphosis. Cranial MRI demonstrated hypointense linear striations at the pons. Tensor diffusion MRI sequences revealed that these striations corresponded with hyperplastic pontocerebellar fibres, and tractographic sequences showed interrupted pyramidal tracts at the pons. Ocular coherence tomography demonstrated abnormal thickness of the nerve fibre layer. Electrophysiological studies showed nerve conduction abnormalities compatible with a dysmyelinating neuropathy, with signs of chronic denervation in distal muscles. The authors suggest that the hyperplastic pontocerebellar fibres compress the pyramidal tracts at the pons, and that the amount of retinal fibres traversing the optic discs is enlarged. These facts point to the contribution of an abnormal developmental mechanism in the ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay. Accordingly, spasticity would be mediated by compression of the pyramidal tracts, neuromuscular symptoms by secondary axonal degeneration superimposed on the peripheral myelinopathy, while the cause of the progressive ataxia remains speculative. The distinctive aspect of the dorsal spine could be of help in the clinical diagnosis."

Custom, ultrahigh-resolution imaging modalities were used to evaluate segmented retinal layer thickness in 3D volumes (Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography), cone photoreceptor density (adaptive optics fundus camera), and the length of inner and outer segments of cone photoreceptors (adaptive optics-optical coherence tomography). Quantitative comparisons were made with age-matched controls, or by comparing affected and nonaffected retinal areas defined by changes in visual fields. The integrity of outer retinal layers on optical coherence tomography B-scans and density of cone photoreceptors were correlated with visual field sensitivity at corresponding retinal locations following reductions in inner retinal thickness. The photoreceptor outer segments were shorter and exhibited greater variability in retinal areas associated with visual field losses compared with normal or less affected areas of the same patient's visual field. These results demonstrate that nonglaucomatous and glaucomatous optic neuropathies are associated with outer retinal changes following long-term inner retinal pathology."

CD008803,0,15599806,0,[Non-invasive determination of intracranial pressure. Physiological basis and practical procedure].,It has been shown in some recently published papers that the intracranial pressure can be determined by dynamometric measurement of the outflow pressure of the central retinal vein (VOP). The knowledge gained by the basic experiments of Baurmann in 1925 has been forgotten by the ophthalmic community for many years. In this paper the basic phenomena of venous collapse are outlined which are fundamentally different from the biomechanics of the arterial collapse phenomenon observed by ophthalmodynamometry. A practical guideline is given for the dynamometric measurement of venous outflow pressure which equals the intracranial pressure. Performing dynamometry of the central retinal vein enables the ophthalmologist to determine intracranial pressure in a non-invasive way.

Capillary disturbances and related vascular leakage in the retina and choroidea may also be seen in patients supported by VADs. We aimed to evaluate retinal vasculature deteriorations after VAD implantation. The charts of 17 patients who underwent VAD implantation surgery for the treatment of end-stage heart failure were retrospectively reviewed. Eight cases (47.1%) underwent pulsatile pump implantation (Berlin Heart EXCOR, Berlin Heart Mediprodukt GmbH, Berlin, Germany); however, nine cases (52.9%) had continuous-flow pump using centrifugal design (HeartWare, HeartWare Inc., Miramar, FL, USA). Study participants were selected among the patients who had survived with a VAD for at least 6 months, and results of detailed ophthalmologic examinations including optic coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus fluorescein angiography (FA) were documented. All of the 17 patients were male, with a mean age of 48.5 ± 14.8 years (15-67 years). Detailed ophthalmologic examinations including the evaluation of retinal vascular deteriorations via FA were performed at a mean of 11.8 ± 3.7 months of follow-up (6-18 months). Mean best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure were found as logMAR 0.02 ± 0.08 and 14.6 ± 1.9 mm Hg, respectively in the study population. Dilated fundoscopy revealed severe focal arteriolar narrowing in two patients (11.8%), and arteriovenous crossing changes in four patients (23.5%); however, no pathological alteration was present in macular OCT scans. In patients with continuous-flow blood pumps, mean arm-retina circulation time (ARCT) and arteriovenous transit time (AVTT) were found to be 16.8 ± 3.0 and 12.4 ± 6.2 s, respectively; whereas those with pulsatile-flow blood pumps were found to be 17.4 ± 3.6 and 14.0 ± 2.1 s in patients (P=0.526 and P=0.356, respectively). FA also revealed a tendency for increased frequency of dye leakage from the optic disc in our study population. Except for remarkable delays in both ARCT and AVTT as well as a tendency for increased frequency of dye leakage from the optic disc, ophthalmologic evaluations revealed no other significant pathology or vascular deterioration in the retina that could be attributed to artificial heart systems."

CD008803,0,18929126,0,Assessment of neuroprotection in the retina with DARC.,"Currently, assessment of new drug efficacy in glaucoma relies on conventional perimetry to monitor visual field changes. However, visual field defects cannot be detected until 20-40% of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the key cells implicated in the development of irreversible blindness in glaucoma, have been lost. We have recently developed a new, noninvasive real-time imaging technology, which is named DARC (detection of apoptosing retinal cells), to visualize single RGC undergoing apoptosis, the earliest sign of glaucoma. Utilizing fluorescently labeled annexin 5 and confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscopy, DARC enables evaluation of treatment effectiveness by monitoring RGC apoptosis in the same living eye over time. Using DARC, we have assessed different neuroprotective therapies in glaucoma-related animal models and demonstrated DARC to be a useful tool in screening neuroprotective strategies. DARC will potentially provide a meaningful clinical end point that is based on the direct assessment of the RGC death process, not only being useful in assessing treatment efficacy, but also leading to the early identification of patients with glaucoma. Clinical trials of DARC in glaucoma patients are due to start in 2008."

A case example is presented in this report that shows the effect that vertical displacements of the OCT scan have on measured RNFL thickness.

CD008803,0,11193944,0,[New examination methods for macular disorders--application of diagnosis and treatment].,"To establish a diagnosis or evaluate the efficacy of treatment for macular disorders, we need methods to evaluate the anatomical and functional changes of these disorders. In this article, we describe several studies that we have conducted for 2 years. In section 1, we report our new methods for making a diagnosis and evaluating visual function in macular disorders. In section 2, we describe our trials of these examination methods in treatment. Here is the summary of our results. In section 1, to examine the structures of the macular area, we used a retinal thickness analyzer (RTA), a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph, HRT), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure retinal thickness and assess retinal microstructures. We compared retinal imaging analysis of various macular diseases obtained with these three instruments. With the RTA, we obtained good three-dimensional macular images displayed on a retinal thickness map, but the retinal thickness map did not demonstrate the thickened retina with dense retinal hemorrhages, and high backscattering from hard exudates might obscure the vitreoretinal interface. The HRT three-dimensional topographic image clearly showed the undulation of the retinal surface. However, it took a relatively long time to obtain the HRT image, and we sometimes could not obtain good topographic images because of fixation movement. Examination with the OCT allows confirmation of the retinal cross-sectional structures, such as retinoschisis or cystoid spaces and the vitreomacular interface, such as vitreous traction, that cannot be detected using other conventional methods with high resolution, but high reflectivity from dense hemorrhages obscured the deeper layers of the retinal structures. Measurement of retinal thickness obtained with both the RTA and OCT is highly reproducible, and there was significant correlation between the retinal thicknesses measured with the two instruments. We believe that these three instruments might contribute significantly to early, accurate diagnosis and better monitoring of the therapeutic effects of vitrectomy for macular diseases. In the future, if these fundus imaging analysis instruments can achieve higher resolution and can analyze three-dimensional retinal images, they will provide better information to clinically evaluate macular diseases. We demonstrated vitreous examination and examination from the retinal surface to the deeper retinal layer at the macular area using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). The SLO examination with an argon laser and a large confocal aperture was useful for conducting kinetic examination of the vitreous opacity above the macula. With a diode laser and a ring aperture (dark-field mode), it was possible to examine the retina from the deeper retinal layer to the choroids. On the other hand, the SLO also allows us to conduct a functional examination of fixation. We demonstrated that the referred retinal locus of fixation may change during the follow-up period in patients whose central fixation is impaired due to macular disease, and we showed that the fixation behavior was related to the visual acuity. Therefore, the SLO is an ideal instrument for determining the visual field and the visual acuity before and after treatment in patients with macular disease, because of its precise localization of the examination point by directly observing the fundus and by monitoring fixation behavior. Our new program installed in the SLO allows us to complete the quantitative retinal sensitivity evaluation within 2 minutes, which is difficult to do using a conventional SLO program. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that minute functional changes in the retina can be detected by the SLO under low background illuminance. Such changes cannot be detected under conventional conditions. In addition, the extrafoveal visual acuity of normal subjects and patients with macular disease was studied using this new SLO program. The iso-acuity lines could be illustrated by summarizing these results in normal subjects. The SLO acuity of the horizontal meridian is significantly better than that of the vertical meridian, and even in the nasal area adjacent to the optic disc, an acuity of better than 0.1 could be achieved. To evaluate macular function, we also investigated the blood flow of the choroid (CF), the retina (RF), and the choriocapillaris at the fovea (CCF). We investigated the CF in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) measurements. In patients with exudative AMD, the POBF was significantly lower than in patients with nonexudative AMD or in control subjects. Decreased CF may play a role in the development of choroidal neovascularization in AMD. RF was measured using laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"

Substantial variability exists in the interpretation of optic disc change over time. There are consistent evidences that image analysis devices such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT-II) can detect early to moderate glaucoma as well as expert assessment of stereoscopic optic disc and RNFL photographs. Optic disc and RNFL defect can be quantitatively measured by these devices. But the sensitivity and specificity of the measurements obtained with these devices are not good enough for the early diagnosis of POAG at this time due to several reasons, such as individual variety of the structure parameters in normal subjects, lack of powerful normative database, lack of diagnostic parameters which are good enough both in sensitivity and specificity for detecting early glaucoma damage. However, information obtained from these image analysis devices might be helpful in early POAG diagnosis if clinicians can understand the advantages and limitations of these instruments."

To determine whether the afferent visual system is involved in FRMD7 mutations, we performed in situ hybridization studies in human embryonic and fetal stages (35 days post-ovulation to 9 weeks post-conception). We show a dynamic retinal expression pattern of FRMD7 during development. We observe expression within the outer neuroblastic layer, then in the inner neuroblastic layer and at 9 weeks post-conception a bilaminar expression pattern. Expression was also noted within the developing optic stalk and optic disk. We identified a large cohort of IIN patients (n = 100), and performed sequence analysis which revealed 45 patients with FRMD7 mutations. Patients with FRMD7 mutations underwent detailed retinal imaging studies using ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence tomography. The tomograms were compared with a control cohort (n = 60). The foveal pit was significantly shallower in FRMD7 patients (P < 0.0001). The optic nerve head morphology was abnormal with significantly decreased optic disk area, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, cup area and cup depth in FRMD7 patients (P < 0.0001). This study shows for the first time that abnormal afferent system development is associated with FRMD7 mutations and could be an important etiological factor in the development of nystagmus."

Myelinated nerve fiber lesions appeared as white or gray-white striated patches corresponding in shape to the distribution of retinal nerve fibers and demonstrated frayed borders. Myelinated retinal nerve fibers were continuous with the optic nerve head in 14 (33%) and discontinuous with the optic nerve head in 28 (66%) affected eyes. By light microscopy and electron microscopy, myelinated retinal fibers were marked by a ganglion cell axon surrounded by concentric lipoprotein lamellae that formed the myelin sheath. Glial cells were often prominent near the myelin sheaths, but other components of the sensory retina were morphologically normal. Clinically, 32 patients with myelinated retinal nerve fibers had comparable overall features, visual field defects less extensive than expected on the basis of ophthalmoscopic appearance, and normal findings on fluorescein angiography. Four patients had a syndrome characterized by ipsilateral extensive myelinated retinal nerve fibers, anisometropic myopia, amblyopia, and strabismus."
CD008803,0,21198153,0,Visibility of trabecular meshwork by standard and polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography.,"Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) is known to be advantageous because of its additional tissue-specific contrast of the anterior eye. So far, this advantage has been shown only qualitatively. We evaluate the improved visibility afforded by 3-D PS corneal and anterior eye segment OCT (PS-CAS-OCT) in visualizing the trabecular meshwork (TM) based on statistical evidences. A total of 31 normal subjects participated in this study. The anterior eye segments of both the eyes of the subjects are scanned using a custom-made PS-CAS-OCT and the standard-scattering OCT (S-OCT) and polarization-sensitive phase-retardation OCT (P-OCT) images are obtained. Three graders grade the visibility of the TM using a four-leveled grading system. The intergrader agreement, intermodality differences, and interquadrant dependence of visibility are statistically examined. All three of three combinations of graders show substantial agreement in visibility with P-OCT (ρ = 0.74, 0.70, and 0.68, Spearman's correlation), while only one of three shows substantial agreement with S-OCT (ρ = 0.72). Significant dependence of the visibility on the modality (S-OCT versus P-OCT) and quadrants are found by the analysis of variance. A subsequent Wilcoxon signed-rank test reveals significantly improved visibility. PS-CAS-OCT may become a useful tool for screening angle-closure glaucoma."

The instrument records three parameters simultaneously: intensity, phase retardation and optic-axis orientation. 3D data sets are recorded in the optic nerve-head area of a healthy and a glaucomatous eye, and the results are presented in various ways: En-face phase-retardation maps of the RNFL are generated from the recorded 3D data and results are compared with scanning laser polarimetry (SLP). The depth information provided by OCT is used to segment the RNFL in the intensity image and measure the RNFL thickness.

CD008803,0,22583437,0,Optical coherence tomography detection of neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis.,"The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is typically characterised by inflammation and demyelination leading to neurodegeneration, which is associated with disability and the progressive stages of MS. The visual system is a valuable tool for studying neurodegeneration and potential neuroprotection in the central nervous system due to its ease of accessibility. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive tool, which can be used to measure the thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). The thickness of RNFL is reduced following the development of MS and optic neuritis and can therefore be used as a correlate of global axonal loss. OCT is currently being investigated as a structural outcome measure for neuroprotective clinical trials of MS. This review describes the relationship between MS and optic neuritis and the associated RNFL thinning, the technology and advancements of OCT, the role of OCT in clinical trials for new neuroprotective therapies in MS and the future role of OCT in MS research."
CD008803,0,21743018,0,Expression profile of the matricellular protein osteopontin in primary open-angle glaucoma and the normal human eye.,"PURPOSE. To characterize the role of osteopontin (OPN) in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and normal eyes. METHODS. OPN quantification was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in aqueous humor (AH) obtained from human donor eyes (POAG and normal) and surgical samples (POAG and elective cataract removal). OPN expression and localization in whole eye tissue sections and primary normal human trabecular meshwork (NTM) cells were studied by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Latanoprost-free acid (LFA)-treated NTM cells were analyzed for OPN gene and protein expression. Intraocular pressure was measured by tonometry, and central corneal thickness was measured by optical coherence tomography in young OPN(-/-) and wild-type mice. RESULTS. OPN levels were significantly reduced in donor POAG AH compared with normal AH (0.54 ± 0.18 ng/μg [n = 8] vs. 0.77 ± 0.23 ng/μg [n = 9]; P = 0.039). A similar trend was observed in surgical AH (1.05 ± 0.31 ng/μg [n = 20] vs. 1.43 ± 0.88 ng/μg [n = 20]; P = 0.083). OPN was present in the trabecular meshwork, corneal epithelium and endothelium, iris, ciliary body, retina, vitreous humor, and optic nerve. LFA increased OPN gene expression, but minimal change in OPN protein expression was observed. No difference in intraocular pressure (17.5 ± 2.0 mm Hg [n = 56] vs. 17.3 ± 1.9 mm Hg [n = 68]) but thinner central corneal thickness (91.7 ± 3.6 μm [n = 50] vs. 99.2 ± 5.5 μm [n = 70]) was noted between OPN(-/-) and wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS. OPN is widely distributed in the human eye and was found in lower concentrations in POAG AH. Reduction of OPN in young mice does not affect IOP."

CD008803,0,24974011,0,A retinal vessel boundary tracking method based on Bayesian theory and multi-scale line detection.,"A retinal vessel tracking method based on Bayesian theory and multi-scale line detection is proposed in this paper. The optic disk is located by a PCA method and the initial points of tracking are identified. In each step, candidate points for vessel edges are selected on a semi-ellipse. Three types of vessel structure are considered in the tracking: normal vessel, branching, and crossing. To determine the new pair of edge points, the characteristics of the vessel intensity profiles along both the cross section and the longitudinal direction are considered in the tracking. A Gaussian model is assumed in the cross section and multi-scale line detection is employed in the longitudinal direction. The advantage of the proposed method is that two dimensional vessel information is employed, which makes it work better than methods using one dimensional information only. Our method is tested on the REVIEW database and a comparison study is performed. Experimental results show that the proposed method is precise and robust in tracking vessel edges."

CD008803,0,15534595,0,A history of the optic nerve and its diseases.,"We will trace the history of ideas about optic nerve anatomy and function in the Western world from the ancient Greeks to the early 20th century and show how these influenced causal theories of optic nerve diseases. Greek and Roman humoral physiology needed a hollow optic nerve, the obstruction of which prevented the flow of visual spirit to and from the brain and resulted in blindness. Medieval physicians understood that the presence of a fixed dilated pupil indicated optic nerve obstruction, preventing the passage of visual spirit, and that cataract surgery in such cases would not restore sight. During the Renaissance, the organ of vision was transferred from the lens to the optic nerve, which was generally believed to be on the axis of the eye. The acuity of central vision (at the optic disc) was explained by the concentration of visual spirit where the optic nerve met the retina. The growth of anatomy and influence of mechanical philosophy from the 17th century led to visual spirit being replaced with the concept of nerve force, which later became associated with electricity travelling along nerve fibres. This coincided with discourse about the nature of the nervous system and a shift in orientation from understanding illness holistically in terms of an individual's humoral imbalance to the concept of organ-based diseases. Both the microscope and the ophthalmoscope allowed visualisation of the optic nerve, but problems of interpretation persisted until conceptual transformations in medical science were made."

CD008803,0,23046745,0,[Angioid streaks].,"Angioid streaks represent breaks in Bruch's membrane, appearing as dark or reddish radial streaks eminating from the optic disc. Usually asymptomatic, these streaks may develop neovascularisation and lead to a maculopathy with marked loss of vision. Some associations with systemic disease are classically described, especially pseudoxanthoma elasticum. This condition may involve cardiovascular complications. A mutation has been found in the ABCC6 gene, which encodes for a membrane transport protein involved in the synthesis of the extracellular matrix. Imaging allows for visualization of the extent of the streaks, and autofluorescence is particularly informative. Spectral domain OCT may also demonstrate early breaks in Bruch's membrane. Neovascular complications, previously responsible for inevitable visual impairment at some point after their occurrence, are now managed by intravitreal injections of anti-VEGFs with clear efficacity. The ophthalmologist must be aware of this condition, in order to guide the patient towards a systemic work-up if necessary, and also to insure quick and targeted treatment in the case of neovascular complications."

To address the role on CB1Rs in the pathophysiology of human MS, we first investigated the impact of AAT trinucleotide short tandem repeat polymorphism of CNR1 gene on CB1R cell expression, and secondly on the inflammatory neurodegeneration process responsible for irreversible disability in MS patients. We found that MS patients with long AAT repeats within the CNR1 gene (≥12 in both alleles) had more pronounced neuronal degeneration in response to inflammatory white matter damage both in the optic nerve and in the cortex. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), in fact, showed more severe alterations of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and of the macular volume (MV) after an episode of optic neuritis in MS patients carrying the long AAT genotype of CNR1. MS patients with long AAT repeats also had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of increased gray matter damage in response to inflammatory lesions of the white matter, especially in areas with a major role in cognition. In parallel, visual abilities evaluated at the low contrast acuity test, and cognitive performances were negatively influenced by the long AAT CNR1 genotype in our sample of MS patients. Our results demonstrate the biological relevance of the (AAT)n CNR1 repeats in the inflammatory neurodegenerative damage of MS."
CD008803,0,20207964,0,Relationship of retinal vascular tortuosity with the neuroretinal rim: the singapore malay eye study.,"PURPOSE. To describe the association of retinal vascular tortuosity, measured quantitatively, with the neuroretinal rim. METHODS. A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in Malay persons aged 40 to 80 years residing in Singapore. Retinal vascular tortuosity was quantified by using a semiautomated, computer-assisted program assessing retinal fundus photographs, according to a standardized protocol. Optic disc measurements including disc area, rim area, and rim-to-disc area (RDA) ratio were obtained with a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope. RESULTS. In analyses adjusting for age, sex, spherical equivalent, and retinal vascular caliber, reduced arteriolar and venular tortuosity were associated with a decrease in global RDA ratio (P = 0.006 and P = 0.001, respectively). When compared with the arterioles, retinal venular tortuosity demonstrated a stronger association with RDA ratio. The temporal-inferior region of the neuroretinal rim was most strongly associated with retinal vascular tortuosity. CONCLUSIONS. Straighter retinal vessels were significantly associated with a thinning neuroretinal rim. These findings may provide additional insights into the geometric retinal vascular changes seen in early glaucomatous optic neuropathy."

CD008803,0,8894775,0,Displacement correction and surface reconstruction of the retina using scanning laser ophthalmoscopic images.,"A method for a three-dimensional surface reconstruction of the retina in the area of the papilla is presented. The surface reconstruction is based on a sequence of discrete gray-level images of the retina recorded by a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). The underlying assumption of the surface reconstruction algorithm developed here is that the depth information is also encoded in the brightness values of the single pixels in addition to the ordinary spatial 2D information. The brightness of an image position depends on the degree of reflection of a confocal laser beam. Only those surface structures located directly in the focus plane of the confocal laser beam produce a high response to the laser light. The displacements between the single images of a sequence are considered to be approximately linear and are corrected by applying the cepstrum technique. The depth is estimated from the volumetric representation of the image sequence by searching for the maximal value of the brightness within a computed depth profile, at every image position. In the resulting images, disturbances occurring during the recording cause incorrect local estimations of the depth. These local disturbances are corrected by applying specially developed surface improvement processes. The work is concluded with a comparison of several different approaches to reduce the noise and disturbances in SLO image data."

CD008803,0,25438685,0,Macular asymmetry analysis in sighting ocular dominance.,"Sighting ocular dominance is the preference of one eye over the other in terms of sighting. In this study, our aim was to examine differences in interocular and intraocular macular thickness, interocular fovea-optic disc angle, and foveal blood vessel asymmetries associated with sighting ocular dominance. Ninety eyes of 45 healthy young adults were included in this prospective, cross-sectional, and comparative study. Sighting ocular dominance was determined by a hole-in-the-card test. Macular thickness measurements were taken and posterior pole asymmetry analysis conducted with spectral domain optical coherence tomography. The optic disc-fovea angle and visible foveal blood vessel counts were calculated by using the posterior pole retinal images of optical coherence tomography. The mean age of the participants was 27.3 (standard deviation [SD] 6.6) years. There were 20 males and 25 females. The mean total macular area thickness, and mean macular thickness of the superior and inferior hemispheres of the dominant and nondominant eyes were similar (p > 0.05). Macular asymmetry analysis revealed no statistically significant interocular difference (p > 0.05). In the dominant eyes, the mean optic disc-fovea angle was 5.24° (SD 1.77), whereas it was 5.49° (SD 2.58) in the nondominant eyes (p = 0.51). The number of visible blood vessels passing through the fovea was similar in the dominant and nondominant eyes (p > 0.05). These results suggested that interocular and intraocular macular thickness differences, interocular fovea-optic disc angle differences, and number of visible foveal blood vessels are not associated with sighting ocular dominance."

CD008803,0,23883953,0,In vivo optic nerve head biomechanics: performance testing of a three-dimensional tracking algorithm.,"Measurement of optic nerve head (ONH) deformations could be useful in the clinical management of glaucoma. Here, we propose a novel three-dimensional tissue-tracking algorithm designed to be used in vivo. We carry out preliminary verification of the algorithm by testing its accuracy and its robustness. An algorithm based on digital volume correlation was developed to extract ONH tissue displacements from two optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes of the ONH (undeformed and deformed). The algorithm was tested by applying artificial deformations to a baseline OCT scan while manipulating speckle noise, illumination and contrast enhancement. Tissue deformations determined by our algorithm were compared with the known (imposed) values. Errors in displacement magnitude, orientation and strain decreased with signal averaging and were 0.15 µm, 0.15° and 0.0019, respectively (for optimized algorithm parameters). Previous computational work suggests that these errors are acceptable to provide in vivo characterization of ONH biomechanics. Our algorithm is robust to OCT speckle noise as well as to changes in illumination conditions, and increasing signal averaging can produce better results. This algorithm has potential be used to quantify ONH three-dimensional strains in vivo, of benefit in the diagnosis and identification of risk factors in glaucoma."

CD008803,0,17867794,0,Autocalibration of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography spectrometers for in vivo quantitative retinal nerve fiber layer birefringence determination.,"Accurate wavelength assignment of each spectral element for spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) is required for proper construction of biological tissue cross-sectional images. This becomes more critical for functional extensions of these techniques, especially in polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT), where incorrect wavelength assignment between the two orthogonal polarization channels leads to polarization artifacts. We present an autocalibration method for wavelength assignment that does not require separate calibration measurements and that can be applied directly on actual data. Removal of the birefringence artifact is demonstrated in a PS-OCT system with picometer accuracy in the relative wavelength assignment, resulting in a residual phase error of 0.25 deg/100 microm. We also demonstrate, for the first time, a quantitative birefringence map of an in vivo human retinal nerve fiber layer."
CD008803,0,17867793,0,Minimum distance mapping using three-dimensional optical coherence tomography for glaucoma diagnosis.,"Objective imaging of the optic nerve structure has become central to the management of patients with glaucoma. There is an urgent need in diagnosis and staging for reliable objective precursors and markers. Three-dimensional ultrahigh-resolution frequency domain optical coherence tomography (3D UHR OCT) holds particular promise in this respect since it enables volumetric assessment of intraretinal layers including tomographic data for the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and optic nerve head. The integrated analysis of this information and the resolution advantage has enabled the development of more informative indices of axonal damage in glaucoma compared with measurements of RNFL thickness and cup-to-disc ratio provided by commercial OCT devices. The potential for UHR OCT in enabling the combined analysis of tomographic and volumetric data on retinal structure is explored. A novel parameter was developed; the three-dimensional minimal distance as the optical correlate of true retinal nerve fiber layer thickness around the optic nerve head region. For the purposes of this pilot study, we present data from a normal subject and from two patients with characteristic optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer changes secondary to glaucoma."
CD008803,0,11675580,0,The glaucomas.,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The World Health Organization reported in 1995 that 5.1 million persons were bilaterally blind from glaucoma. Its morbidity and prevalence make it a significant public health problem. Because it is a treatable condition, it is important that medical professionals be familiar with this disease, which in most cases is not associated with signs and symptoms that may alert the patient or the physician of its presence. Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy that leads to blindness if left untreated. Risk factors include elevated intraocular pressure, advanced age, African ancestry and positive family history. Several types of glaucomas have been described: acute and chronic, secondary and primary. Primary (Chronic) Open Angle Glaucoma is the most common, with a prevalence in the USA of 1.55%. Blacks are 4 to 5 times more affected than whites. Treatment of glaucoma consists of topical or systemic intraocular pressure lowering agents, laser treatment or surgery. Primary Open Angle Glaucoma is an often-unrecognized disease due to its slow course and lack of symptoms. Because the decline in vision may be slowed but not restored by treatment, it is important that this condition be diagnosed early in its course."

A cost-effectiveness analysis.,"We designed an intricate model of the process of glaucoma screening, diagnosis, and treatment in order to evaluate the medical care costs of such efforts in relation to the benefits in terms of quality-adjusted years of vision saved, utilizing the economic principles of cost-effectiveness analysis. Although a relatively limited data base and numerous assumptions concerning the accuracy of diagnostic tests, the natural history of ocular hypertension and glaucoma, and the effectiveness of available treatment modalities, limit our ability to draw definitive conclusions concerning the cost-effectiveness of various glaucoma screening options, our analysis indicates that glaucoma screening is probably cost-effective when targeted at certain subgroups of the population. Our analysis suggests that changes in several aspects of existing screening policies may be appropriate if cost-effectiveness is to be used as one of the criteria for the efficient allocation of resources to and within screening programs. Specifically, combinations of screening tests and screening targeted at high risk populations such as blacks, diabetics, and relatives of glaucoma patients are probably more cost-effective than screening of the general population with a single test. In younger populations, the importance of detecting ocular hypertension argues for the use of tonometry. Ophthalmoscopy may be more cost-effective in older age groups in whom the higher prevalence of glaucoma outweighs the need for identifying ocular hypertensives. In the very elderly, automated perimetry becomes cost-effective since the detection of established field loss will have greater yield. In addition, it is evident that diversion of resources away from actual screening efforts and towards efforts aimed at improving follow-up and compliance would be an additional cost-effective strategy."
CD008803,0,21723180,0,"Coupled parametric model for estimation of visual field tests based on OCT macular thickness maps, and vice versa, in glaucoma care.","The current standard of care for glaucoma patients consists of functional assessment of vision via visual field (VF) testing, which is sensitive but subjective, time-consuming, and often unreliable. A new imaging technology, Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), is being introduced to assess the structural characteristics of the macula. This new complementary exam is efficient, objective, and reliable. A complex, but consistent, relationship exists between the structural information provided by macular OCT and the functional information gathered by VF maps. We propose a learning-based framework with the ability to estimate the VF map based on OCT macular thickness measurements as input (and vice versa). Central to this algorithmic framework is a coupled parametric model that captures not only the individual variabilities of the OCT macular thickness measurements and the VF maps, but also their co-dependencies. This model is derived by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to a library consisting of various pairs of OCT and VF maps. The parameters of this coupled model are obtained by solving a linear least squares problem. Next, these estimated parameters are used, in conjunction with the eigenvectors derived from PCA, to compute the estimate. The accuracy of this coupled parametric estimation model was evaluated by performing multiple leave-one-out cross validation experiments."

CD008803,0,19624349,0,Imaging of the anterior segment in glaucoma.,"Although constituting only about a quarter of all glaucoma, angle closure glaucoma causes a disproportionate amount of visual morbidity and is predicted to be responsible for almost half of bilateral blindness by 2020. Early detection and treatment of angle closure significantly improves visual prognosis. Identification of eyes at risk of angle closure currently relies on opportunistic case detection, often by gonioscopy. However, gonioscopy is a highly subjective technique and often leads to misdiagnosis and underdetection of angle closure. More recently, various imaging modalities that allow a more objective assessment of the anterior segment structures, including anterior segment optical coherence tomography and the scanning peripheral anterior chamber depth analyser, have come under close scrutiny for their potential in screening for angle closure. Their accuracy and repeatability, advantages and disadvantages as well as their ease of use are all important to consider whether they are intended for use in the clinical setting or if they are to be incorporated into mass screening programs. Furthermore, their place alongside gonioscopy and more established technologies such as ultrasound biomicroscopy must be considered. The aim of this paper is to review the anterior segment imaging technologies that are currently available."

The commercially available SD-OCT technology offers benefits over the conventional time domain (TD) OCT such as a scanning speed up to 200 times faster and higher axial resolution (3 to 6 μm). Overall, SD-OCT offers improved performance in terms of reproducibility. SD-OCT has a level of discriminating capability, between healthy and perimetric glaucoma eyes similar to that obtained with TD-OCT. Furthermore, the capabilities and features of SD-OCT are rapidly evolving, mainly due to three-dimensional imaging and image rendering. More sophisticated approaches for macular and optic disc assessment are expected to be employed in clinical practice. Analysis software should be further refined for interpretation of SD-OCT images in order to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of glaucoma diagnostics. Most importantly for SD-OCT is determination of its ability to diagnostic structural glaucomatous progression. Considering the recent launch time of the commercially available SD-OCT and slow progressing characteristic of glaucoma, we must wait for longitudinal SD-OCT data, with a long enough follow-up, to become available."

CD008803,0,19758857,0,Segmentation of the optic disc in 3-D OCT scans of the optic nerve head.,"Glaucoma is the second leading ocular disease causing blindness due to gradual damage to the optic nerve and resultant visual field loss. Segmentations of the optic disc cup and neuroretinal rim can provide important parameters for detecting and tracking this disease. The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate a method that can automatically segment the optic disc cup and rim in spectral-domain 3-D OCT (SD-OCT) volumes. Four intraretinal surfaces were segmented using a fast multiscale 3-D graph search algorithm. After surface segmentation, the retina in each 3-D OCT scan was flattened to ensure a consistent optic nerve head shape. A set of 15 features, derived from the segmented intraretinal surfaces and voxel intensities in the SD-OCT volume, were used to train a classifier that can determine which A-scans in the OCT volume belong to the background, optic disc cup and rim. Finally, prior knowledge about the shapes of the cup and rim was incorporated into the system using a convex hull-based approach. Two glaucoma experts annotated the cup and rim area using planimetry, and the annotations of the first expert were used as the reference standard. A leave-one-subject-out experiment on 27 optic nerve head-centered OCT volumes (14 right eye scans and 13 left eye scans from 14 patients) was performed. Two different types of classification methods were compared, and experimental results showed that the best performing method had an unsigned error for the optic disc cup of 2.52+/-0.87 pixels (0.076+/-0.026 mm) and for the neuroretinal rim of 2.04+/-0.86 pixels (0.061+/-0.026 mm). The interobserver variability as indicated by the unsigned border positioning difference between the second expert observer and the reference standard was 2.54+/-1.03 pixels (0.076+/-0.031 mm for the optic disc cup and 2.14+/-0.80 pixels (0.064+/-0.024 mm for the neuroretinal rim.

Effects of different disease modifying treatments (DMT) were further evaluated by measuring OCT parameters and whether a correlation exists between the RNFL thickness, disease duration and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) were also assessed. 13 patients were on interferon beta-1a (IFN), 14 patients were receiving glatiramer acetate (GA), 19 patients were not being treated with any DMT and 21 healthy controls were included the study. During OCT examination, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness was found to be lower in all MS groups but macular volume (MV) was lower only in GA group than controls. Although, P100 latencies were longer than controls in all MS groups, there was no statistically significant difference between IFN and w/o DMT groups. Patients with ON history, P100 latencies were found significantly longer than those without ON. VEP amplitudes were found lower with ON history patients than those without ON, however this was not statistically significant. EDSS strongly correlated with P100 latency, RNLF, GCC but no correlation was observed with VEP amplitude and MV. Our results show that RNFL, GCC and MV were all decreased in MS patients with or without DMT comparing to controls and it is more prominent in eyes with ON. Further follow-up studies are warranted to understand the pathophysiology of CNS axonal degeneration and involvement of optic nerves."

CD008803,0,19296047,0,Assessing structure and function of the afferent visual pathway in multiple sclerosis and associated optic neuritis.,"The afferent visual pathway is commonly affected in MS. Assessment of the afferent visual pathway using clinical, imaging and electrophysiological methods not only provides insights into the pathophysiology of MS, but also provides a method of investigating potential therapeutic measures in MS. This review summarises the various assessment methods, in particular imaging techniques of the visual pathway. Retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness is usually reduced following an episode of optic neuritis. Techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry, and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy are used to quantify RNFL thickness. MRI of the optic nerve is not routinely used in the diagnosis of MS or optic neuritis, but is valuable in atypical cases and in research. T2- weighted images of the optic nerve usually show the hyperintense lesion in optic neuritis and gadolinium enhancement is seen in the acute attack. Quantifying atrophy of the optic nerve using MRI gives an indication of the degree of axonal loss. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of the optic nerve provides an indication of myelination. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the optic nerve and optic radiation provide information about the integrity of the visual white matter tracts. Functional MRI following visual stimulation is used to assess the contribution of cortical reorganisation to functional recovery following optic neuritis. Investigations including logMAR visual acuity, Sloan contrast acuity, Farnsworth- Munsell 100-hue colour vision tests and Humphrey perimetry provide detailed quantitative information on different aspects of visual function. Visual evoked potentials identify conduction block or delay reflecting demyelination. These collective investigative methods have advanced knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms in MS and optic neuritis. Relevant ongoing studies and future directions are discussed."

Studies on eight affected calves showed that ocular lesions were confined to the retinae and optic nerves. Myriad tiny white spots were visible by ophthalmic examination of the fundus. These spots were related to protuberances on the vitreal surface caused by distended retinal ganglion cells. The perikaryons of these were packed with dense aggregates of membranous cytoplasmic bodies (MCBs). Similar MCBs were present in the perikaryons of amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer of the retina. Wallerian degeneration was present in the optic nerves.

Polarization sensitive OCT (PS-OCT) extends the concept of OCT and utilizes the information that is carried by polarized light to obtain additional information on the tissue. Several structures in the eye (e.g. cornea, retinal nerve fiber layer, retinal pigment epithelium) alter the polarization state of the light and show therefore a tissue specific contrast in PS-OCT images. First this review outlines the basic concepts of polarization changing light-tissue interactions and gives a short introduction in PS-OCT instruments for ophthalmic imaging.

Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography allows for, in addition to study of the macula, screening for associated vasculitis, detection of ischemic areas, easy diagnosis of preretinal, prepaillary or choroidal neovascular complications, and it can provide etiological information and may be required to evaluate the therapeutic response. Treatment of inflammatory macular edema requires specific treatment in cases of infectious or tumoral etiologies. If it remains persistent, or occurs in other etiologies, anti-inflammatory treatments are needed. Steroid treatment, available in intravitreal, subconjunctival and sub-Tenon's routes, are widely used. Limitations of local use include induced cataract and glaucoma, and their short-lasting action. Such products may reveal retinal infection. Thus, bilateral chronic sight-threatening posterior uveitis often requires systemic treatment, and steroids represent the classic first-line therapy. In order to reduce the daily steroid dose, immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory drugs may be added. Certain of these compounds are now available intravitreally."

In this work we were able to solve this problem by developing an atlas of macular thickness of the human retina into which OCT scans were thereafter registered. This atlas is used to allow registering OCT scans from the Fast Macular Protocol, thus bringing OCT scans into the atlas coordinates, therefore correcting for misfixations, while simultaneously allowing to perform OCT inter-scan registration. From this initial registration, we were able to compute a thickness map into which Fast RNFL Protocol scans were merged, thus allowing for increased OCT mapping resolution."

In 13-18% of the patients whitish-grey sheathing of some retinal veins was found (Rucker's symptom) associated with the activity of the demyelinization process--twice as frequently in patients during the period of attack as in subjects in remission of the basic disease. The author differentiates sheathing at rest from the active form which he found only in patients with a fresh attack and which is documented by photographs. Atrophy of the optic disc was found in 23%, retrobulbar neuritis in the case-history of 27% of the subjects. In case of a marginal finding of incipient partial atrophy of the papilla attention is drawn to the subjective character of evaluation and the need of further examinations. The author discuss the pathological background of the finding of sheathing as a perivenous inflammatory infiltration in relation to similar changes in the CNS during demyelinisation. The finding of Rucker's symptom seems to be to a considerable extent pathognomic for multiple cerebrospinal sclerosis and may precede the initial neurological symptomatology."

A prospective comparative study conducted at the Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital. Fifty-six patients from the medical retina clinic. All patients had complete ophthalmic slit-lamp and fundus examinations, colour and red-free fundus photography, AF imaging with both instruments, and fluorescein angiography. Cataract and fixation were graded clinically. AF patterns were analyzed for healthy and pathological features. Differences of image noise were analyzed by cataract grading and fixation. A total of 105 eyes were included. AF patterns discovered by the retina angiograph and the fundus camera images, respectively, were a dark optic disc in 72 % versus 15 %, a dark fovea in 92 % versus 4 %, sub- and intraretinal fluid visible as hyperautofluorescence on HRA images only, lipid exudates visible as hypoautofluorescence on HRA images only. The same autofluorescent pattern was found on both images for geographic atrophy, retinal pigment changes, drusen and haemorrhage. Image noise was significantly associated with the degree of cataract and/or poor fixation, favouring the fundus camera. Images acquired by the fundus camera before and after fluorescein angiography were identical. Fundus AF images differ according to the technical differences of the instruments used. Knowledge of these differences is important not only for correctly interpreting images, but also for selecting the most appropriate instrument for the clinical situation."

CD008803,0,21252110,0,Primary retinal pathology in multiple sclerosis as detected by optical coherence tomography.,"Optical coherence tomography studies in multiple sclerosis have primarily focused on evaluation of the retinal nerve fibre layer. The aetiology of retinal changes in multiple sclerosis is thought to be secondary to optic nerve demyelination. The objective of this study was to use optical coherence tomography to determine if a subset of patients with multiple sclerosis exhibit primary retinal neuronopathy, in the absence of retrograde degeneration of the retinal nerve fibre layer and to ascertain if such patients may have any distinguishing clinical characteristics. We identified 50 patients with multiple sclerosis with predominantly macular thinning (normal retinal nerve fibre-layer thickness with average macular thickness < 5th percentile), a previously undescribed optical coherence tomography defined phenotype in multiple sclerosis, and compared them with 48 patients with multiple sclerosis with normal optical coherence tomography findings, 48 patients with multiple sclerosis with abnormal optical coherence tomography findings (typical for multiple sclerosis) and 86 healthy controls. Utilizing a novel retinal segmentation protocol, we found that those with predominant macular thinning had significant thinning of both the inner and outer nuclear layers, when compared with other patients with multiple sclerosis (P < 0.001 for both), with relative sparing of the ganglion cell layer. Inner and outer nuclear layer thicknesses in patients with non-macular thinning predominant multiple sclerosis were not different from healthy controls. Segmentation analyses thereby demonstrated extensive deeper disruption of retinal architecture in this subtype than may be expected due to retrograde degeneration from either typical clinical or sub-clinical optic neuropathy. Functional corroboration of retinal dysfunction was provided through multi-focal electroretinography in a subset of such patients. These findings support the possibility of primary retinal pathology in a subset of patients with multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis-severity scores were also significantly increased in patients with the macular thinning predominant phenotype, compared with those without this phenotype (n = 96, P=0.006). We have identified a unique subset of patients with multiple sclerosis in whom there appears to be disproportionate thinning of the inner and outer nuclear layers, which may be occurring as a primary process independent of optic nerve pathology. In vivo analyses of retinal layers in multiple sclerosis have not been previously performed, and structural demonstration of pathology in the deeper retinal layers, such as the outer nuclear layer, has not been previously described in multiple sclerosis. Patients with inner and outer nuclear layer pathology have more rapid disability progression and thus retinal neuronal pathology may be a harbinger of a more aggressive form of multiple sclerosis."

CD008803,0,22818584,0,Accurate detection of blood vessels improves the detection of exudates in color fundus images.,"Exudates are one of the earliest and most prevalent symptoms of diseases leading to blindness such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Certain areas of the retina with such conditions are to be photocoagulated by laser to stop the disease progress and prevent blindness. Outlining these areas is dependent on outlining the lesions and the anatomic structures of the retina. In this paper, we provide a new method for the detection of blood vessels that improves the detection of exudates in fundus photographs. The method starts with an edge detection algorithm which results in a over segmented image. Then the new feature-based algorithm can be used to accurately detect the blood vessels. This algorithm considers the characteristics of a retinal blood vessel such as its width range, intensities and orientations for the purpose of selective segmentation. Because of its bulb shape and its color similarity with exudates, the optic disc can be detected using the common Hough transform technique. The extracted blood vessel tree and optic disc could be subtracted from the over segmented image to get an initial estimate of exudates. The final estimation of exudates can then be obtained by morphological reconstruction based on the appearance of exudates. This method is shown to be promising since it increases the sensitivity and specificity of exudates detection to 80% and 100% respectively."

CD008803,0,10180518,0,Imaging of the optic disc in glaucoma: which way to go?,"Less than 10 years ago, fundus photography was believed to be the only method to document optic disc changes in glaucoma. Since then, many sophisticated electronic devices have been developed to supersede conventional photography. At the moment, confocal laser scanning tomography, nerve fiber layer polarimetry, and optical coherence tomography are the most popular techniques. The current status of optic disc imaging in glaucoma can (in our very subjective opinion) be summarized as follows. Confocal laser scanning tomography is the most comprehensively tested electronic modality. It is perhaps the method of choice in major glaucoma centers. Nerve fiber layer polarimetry has forged ahead during the past 2 years and may become an alternative to confocal laser scanning tomography in the future. Optical coherence tomography is a fascinating technique, which may also become important in the future. Right now, however, it is still in the experimental stage. Conventional disc photography--despite all those new techniques--still has its place. Perhaps it is the method of choice in routine glaucoma practice, except those clinics that can afford one of the ""high tech"" machines."

CD008803,0,18508420,0,Correlation between quadrant specific automatic visual field defect and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness as measured by scanning laser polarimetry in patients with primary open angle glaucoma.,"The purpose of this study was to correlate quadrant specific Humphrey visual field mean deviation (MD) with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness as measured by scanning laser polarimetry (GDx), and to determine whether there is a difference in the correlation with visual field defect between the Asian normative database provided by GDx (GDx database) and our native normative database (KMU database). In an age-matched study, a control group of 240 normal eyes underwent GDx. Another 60 eyes with visual field defect due to primary angle glaucoma underwent autoperimetry and GDx examination. First, we compared four GDx measurements between the control and study groups. Next, we divided the visual field into four quadrants (superior, inferior, temporal, nasal) and calculated the MD of each quadrant. We correlated the MD of superior, inferior and overall visual field with RNFL thickness judged by two databases (the GDx Asian internal normative database and the database from our control group). GDx detected abnormal RNFL thickness significantly more accurately when using the KMU database (p = 0.0473 for superior quadrant; p = 0.0074 for inferior quadrant; p = 0.0011 for average thickness) than when using the GDx database. There was no significant difference in the specificity between these two databases. The normal ranges in the GDx internal normative database for Asians are too wide. By using our own GDx normative database, the correlations with MD of autoperimetry were significantly improved. We suggest that every laboratory and clinic establish its own normative database of GDx in Asia."

Estimation of human retinal blood flow by slit-lamp fluorophotometry.,"This article describes a new direct method for estimation of human retinal blood flow by slit-lamp fluorophotometry. The apparatus consists fundamentally of a modified slit lamp with an eye piece containing two fiberoptic probes connected to a double photometric detection system. Both optic fibers are focused on a retinal arterial segment, and the passage of a fluorescein bolus is automatically registered, giving, after correction, the mean transit time. Fluorescein angiography allows the determination of the volume of the arterial segment under study. Values for superior temporal retinal blood flow in healthy individuals show a mean value of 4.2 +/- 0.5 microliter/min. Studies in anemic patients show an increase of approximately 52% in the retinal blood flow. The potential causes of error associated with this technique, apart from the slight increase in intraocular pressure induced by the contact lens used, do not appear to be significant."

CD008803,0,15568942,0,In vivo measurement of time-resolved autofluorescence at the human fundus.,"An experimental setup for measurement of time-resolved autofluorescence of the human eye fundus is demonstrated. The method combines laser scanning technique and time-correlated single photon counting. The light source is a laser diode, delivering pulses of about 100 ps duration at a repetition rate of 40 MHz. The excitation wavelength is 446 nm and the cutoff wavelength of fluorescence detection is at 475 nm. The autofluorescence can be determined with a spatial resolution of 80 x 80 microm2 and 25 ps time resolution. The fluorescence decay is optimally approximated by a biexponential model. The dominating lifetime tau1 is shortest in the macula (320 to 380 ps) and reaches 1500 ps in the optic disk. The lifetime tau2 varies between 2 ns and 5 ns, but the spatial distribution is more homogeneous. Respiration of 100% oxygen for 6 min leads to changes in the fluorescence lifetime pointing to detection of coenzymes. Diagrams of lifetime tau2 versus tau1 are well suited for comparison of substances. Such lifetime clusters of a 20 deg macular field of a young healthy subject and of a patient suffering from dry age-related macular degeneration overlap only partially with tau2-tau1 clusters of lipofuscin."

This letter presents an automated retinal layer segmentation technique for OCT images. In the proposed technique, an OCT image is first cut into multiple vessel and nonvessel sections by the retinal blood vessels that are detected through an iterative polynomial smoothing procedure. The nonvessel sections are then filtered by a bilateral filter and a median filter that suppress the local image noise but keep the global image variation across the retinal layer boundary. Finally, the layer boundaries of the filtered nonvessel sections are detected, which are further classified to different retinal layers to determine the complete retinal layer boundaries. Experiments over OCT for four subjects show that the proposed technique segments an OCT image into five layers accurately."
CD008803,0,20825070,0,Optical coherence tomography in imaging of macular diseases.,"OCT (opitcal coherence tomography), is a diagnostic method that enables the analysis of the retinal structures by means of high-resolution tomographic cross-sections of the retina. Whereas fluorescein and indocyanine angiography allow visualization of the retinal epithelium layer and chorioretinal vessels, OCT may help in diagnosing and monitoring the condition of many internal retinal layers. Ultrasound B-mode examinations have a resolution of about 150 microm while OCT provides a resolution of 10 microm. OCT makes it possible to detect and measure morphological changes, retinal thickness, retinal volume, thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer and various parameters of the optic disc. We use OCT in the analysis of the retinal structures in various pathologies such as macular holes and pseudo-holes, epiretinal membranes, macular edemas of various origins, including vasooclusive disease and diabetic macular edema, lesions of vitreoretinal interface and vitreoretinal traction, serous and hemorrhagic detachments of the retina and of pigment epithelium, age related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma. OCT is an examination that is fast, sensitive, reproducible, non-invasive, non-contact and easy to perform and interpret for a retinologist. The aim of this article is to present OCT principles and techniques as well as OCT interpretation and images of most common retinal diseases: age related macular degeneration--dry and wet form, retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), central serous chorioretinopathy, epiretinal membranes, macular holes, diabetic retinopathy."

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive method for assessment of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and its changes in different diseases. To evaluate the RNFL thickness in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), we performed OCT in patients with PD and compared it with a control group. From October 2010 to July 2011, 27 PD patients (54 eyes) and 25 healthy persons (50 eyes) were entered to this analytical cross-sectional study according to the defined criteria. PD patients were categorized into two groups ""akinetic rigid (AR) and tremor dominant (TD)"". RNFL was divided into four quadrants and was assessed by OCT. Afterwards; the data were analyzed by bivariate and multivariate models. The RNFL thickness in PD was significantly lower than the control group. Also, the thicknesses of inferior and nasal quadrants of RNFL in TD group were significantly more than AR group. According to these findings, OCT can be used as a sensitive and objective marker for assessment of early neurodegenerative changes of PD and early initiation of neuroprotective treatments. Future studies with adequate sample sizes are recommended to investigate interactions between age, distribution of the disease and type of PD as well as the effects of individual factors."

CD008803,0,19163151,0,Level-set based automatic cup-to-disc ratio determination using retinal fundus images in ARGALI.,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of permanent blindness. However, disease progression can be limited if detected early. The optic cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) is one of the main clinical indicators of glaucoma, and is currently determined manually, limiting its potential in mass screening. In this paper, we propose an automatic CDR determination method using a variational level-set approach to segment the optic disc and cup from retinal fundus images. The method is a core component of ARGALI, a system for automated glaucoma risk assessment. Threshold analysis is used in preprocessing to estimate the initial contour. Due to the presence of retinal vasculature traversing the disc and cup boundaries which can cause inaccuracies in the detected contours, an ellipse-fitting post-processing step is also introduced. The method was tested on 104 images from the Singapore Malay Eye Study, and it was found the results produced a clinically acceptable variation of up to 0.2 CDR units from the manually graded samples, with potential use in mass screening."

However, it is unknown if this is a cumulative exposure effect and the impact of prolonged low level exposure, relevant to the majority of patients with a well-functioning prosthesis, has not been studied. Twenty four male patients with a well-functioning MoMHR and an age and time since surgery matched group of 24 male patients with conventional total hip arthroplasty (THA) underwent clinical and electrophysiological assessment of their visual and auditory health at a mean of ten years after surgery. Median circulating cobalt and chromium concentrations were higher in patients after MoMHR versus those with THA (P<0.0001), but were within the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK) investigation threshold. Subjective auditory tests including pure tone audiometric and speech discrimination findings were similar between groups (P>0.05).

Furthermore, the correlation between the ERGs and other functional and structural parameters are investigated. Full-field stimuli were produced using a Ganzfeld bowl with Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) as light sources. On- and off-response ERGs were recorded from 17 healthy subjects, 12 pre-perimetric and 15 perimetric glaucoma patients using 4-Hz luminance rapid-on and rapid-off sawtooth stimuli (white light; mean luminance 55 cd/m(2)) at 100% contrast. The on- and off-responses were added to study response asymmetries. In addition, flash ERGs were elicited by red stimuli (200 cd/m(2)) on a blue background (10 cd/m(2)). The mean deviations (MD) of the visual field defects were obtained by standard automated perimetry. The retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNFLT) was measured with Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SOCT). We studied the correlation between ERG response amplitudes, visual field mean deviation (MDs) and RNFLT values. The on-responses showed an initial negative (N-on) followed by a positive (P-on), a late positive (LP-on) and a late negative responses (LN-on). The off-responses showed an initial positive (P-off) a late positive (LP-off) and a late negative response (LN-off). The addition of on- and off-responses revealed an initial positive (P-add) and a late negative response (LN-add). The on-response components (N-on, P-on and LN-on) in the glaucoma patients were relatively similar to those of the control subjects. However, the LP-on was significantly elevated (p = 0.03) in perimetric patients. The LP-off was significantly elevated (p < 0.001), and the amplitude of LN-off was significantly reduced in perimetric patients (p = 0.02). The LN-add amplitude was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) and delayed (p = 0.03) in perimetric patients. The amplitudes of the LN-off and LN-add ERG components were significantly correlated with the PhNR in the flash ERG (LN-off: p = 0.01; LN-add: p < 0.001) and with RNFLT (LN-off: p = 0.006; LN-add: p = 0.001). On- and off-response ERGs and their response asymmetries, elicited by sawtooth stimuli, are altered in the glaucoma patients. The late components are affected. Changes in the late negative components are correlated with structural and other functional changes."

The aim of this study was to quantify optic nerve involvement at time of diagnosis in a prospectively series of IIH investigated at a single Institution and to identify objective parameters for early diagnosis and follow-up. 38 consecutive patients (9 men, 29 females, mean age 39.8 years) with IIH underwent a complete neuro-ophthalmological evaluation including standardized automated perimetry as functional measurement of optic neuropathy and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) measurements to grade papilledema or optic nerve atrophy. An overall diagnosis of optic nerve involvement was made in 50 out of 76 eyes (66 %); ophthalmoscopic signs of papilledema were identified in 35 eyes (46 %) while optic disc pallor was found in 13 (17 %). In all patients mean visual field deviation (MD, dB) was -7.2 (range 5.3-33.2). SD-OCT measurements of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (PRNFLT) and of macular ganglion cell complex thickness (MGCCT) obtained in 40 eyes (20 subjects) showed normal PRNFLT in 12 eyes (30 %), increased in 16 (40 %) and reduced in 12 eyes (30 %); normal MGCCT in 26 eyes (65 %), reduced in 14 (35 %). In all eyes average RNFLT was increased (mean 130 μm, range 219-59) and average MGCCT was decreased compared to normal values (mean 89.5 μm, range 198-65). Increased PRNFLT was associated with reduced MGCCT in 4 eyes (10 %) indicating early retrograde optic nerve damage. Decreased PRNFLT was associated with decreased MGCCT in 10 eyes (83 %). These results indicate that, in IIH patients, signs of optic neuropathy can be identified in more than half of cases, even without papilledema evidenced on ophthalmoscopic examination. Moreover, an SD-OCT analysis, which can be definitively useful to quantify optic nerve edema or atrophy, can show damage of retinal ganglion cells in an early phase of the disease."
CD008803,0,6676979,0,Funduscopically controlled scotometry.,"The following is a brief summary of the results in our ten groups of cases. The positive features of laser scotometry are emphasized. The normal response is well defined: there are no uncertain blind spot margins. The peripheral field is probably extended beyond 60 degrees nasally and superiorly. The size and shape of the small central scotomas associated with macular holes are easily defined and correlated directly with the visible edge of the hole. This result is distinct from the intact subjective response with cystoid maculopathy and surface wrinkling retinopathy. Plotting the margins of peripheral abnormalities such as retinal detachments, retinoschisis, and lattice degeneration is easily done. Schisis is distinguished by an absolute scotoma. This scotometry is facilitated by a larger ""normal"" field with the laser instrument. Lattice degeneration causes a field defect. A branch retinal artery occlusion shows a slightly jagged border, difficult to detect by standard methods. A cotton-wool spot does not show a total nerve-fiber-bundle defect. Small absolute scotomas are correlated with degenerative changes within nevi. Degenerative changes over small melanomas--ie, the orange spots--also produce absolute field defects. ""Bear track"" lesions have a normal field, whereas dense black isolated lesions are associated with absolute scotomas. In macular degeneration the bright laser test object is usually visible to the patient within detachments of neuroepithelium, detachments of the pigment epithelium, and over recent subretinal neovascularization. Response is absent over sharply-defined zones of pigment atrophy and over late subretinal fibrovascular mounds. In contrast to the degenerative cases, a selection of hereditary cases showed no direct correlation between the zone of pigment atrophy and the zone of absolute scotoma. The scotoma was much larger than the atrophic region, extending to the edge of the cream-colored subretinal spots. The laser target method sharply defines the absolute scotoma associated with papilledema. It also detects a slit-like nerve-fiber-bundle defect, suggesting progressive damage. Small, but possibly not the earliest, scotomas associated with glaucoma can be detected with laser scotometry. In some cases they are detected when the Goldmann perimetric field is normal. Late residual visual fields are easily defined, since fixation can be directly monitored. The vertical border of hemianopic defects can be defined within one degree of accuracy."

CD008803,0,23377007,0,Retinal polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography at 1060 nm with 350 kHz A-scan rate using an Fourier domain mode locked laser.,"We present a novel, high-speed, polarization-sensitive, optical coherence tomography set-up for retinal imaging operating at a central wavelength of 1060 nm which was tested for in vivo imaging in healthy human volunteers. We use the system in combination with a Fourier domain mode locked laser with active spectral shaping which enables the use of forward and backward sweep in order to double the imaging speed without a buffering stage. With this approach and with a custom designed data acquisition system, we show polarization-sensitive imaging with an A-scan rate of 350 kHz. The acquired three-dimensional data sets of healthy human volunteers show different polarization characteristics in the eye, such as depolarization in the retinal pigment epithelium and birefringence in retinal nerve fiber layer and sclera. The increased speed allows imaging of large volumes with reduced motion artifacts. Moreover, averaging several two-dimensional frames allows the generation of high-definition B-scans without the use of an eye-tracking system. The increased penetration depth of the system, which is caused by the longer probing beam wavelength, is beneficial for imaging choroidal and scleral structures and allows automated segmentation of these layers based on their polarization characteristics."

The neuro-ophthalmologic examination includes observation for a compensatory head, face, or chin position; ocular ductions and versions in the nine cardinal positions of gaze; the three-step test; the double Maddox rod test; indirect ophthalmoscopy to observe the location of the fovea in relationship to the optic nerve head to determine cyclodeviation; and the forced ductions test. Binocular vertical diplopia may be due to supranuclear processes, ocular motor nerve dysfunction, neuromuscular junction disease, diseases of eye muscle, mechanical processes causing vertical eye misalignment, and even retinal disease. In this article, the differential diagnosis of these processes is outlined."

CD008803,0,25265602,0,Landmark detection for fusion of fundus and MRI toward a patient-specific multimodal eye model.,"Ophthalmologists typically acquire different image modalities to diagnose eye pathologies. They comprise, e.g., Fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Yet, these images are often complementary and do express the same pathologies in a different way. Some pathologies are only visible in a particular modality. Thus, it is beneficial for the ophthalmologist to have these modalities fused into a single patient-specific model. The goal of this paper is a fusion of Fundus photography with segmented MRI volumes. This adds information to MRI that was not visible before like vessels and the macula. This paper contributions include automatic detection of the optic disc, the fovea, the optic axis, and an automatic segmentation of the vitreous humor of the eye."

Imaging by optical coherence tomography and measurements of the dimensions of the optic nerve head and the nerve fibre layer in central retinal areas is currently used to estimate the grade of pathological changes. The visualization and quantification of ganglion cells and nerve fibres directly in patients would dramatically improve glaucoma diagnostics. We have investigated the optical properties of cellular structures of retinal tissue in order to establish a means of visualizing and quantifying ganglion cells in the living retina without staining. We have characterized the optical properties of retinal tissue in several species including humans. Nerve fibres, blood vessels, ganglion cells and their cell processes have been visualized at high image resolution by means of the reflection mode of a confocal laser scanning microscope. The potential of adaptive optics in current imaging systems and the possibilities of imaging single ganglion cells non-invasively in patients are discussed."

CD008803,0,8746253,0,Infrared imaging of sub-retinal structures in the human ocular fundus.,"The interaction of infrared light with the human ocular fundus, particularly sub-retinal structures, was studied in vivo. Visible and infra-red wavelengths and a scanning laser ophthalmoscope were used to acquire digital images of the human fundus. The contrast and reflectance of selected retinal and sub-retinal features were computed for a series of wavelengths or modes of imaging. Near infrared light provides better visibility than visible light for sub-retinal features. Sub-retinal deposits appear light and thickened; the optic nerve head, retinal vessels, and choroidal vessels appear dark. Contrast and visibility of features increases with increasing wavelength from 795 to 895 nm. Optimizing the mode of imaging improves the visibility of some structures. This new quantitative basis for near infrared imaging techniques can be applied to a wide range of imaging modalities for the study of pathophysiology and treatment in diseases affecting the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch's membrane, such as age-related macular degeneration."
CD008803,0,24065512,0,[Applications of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in neuro-ophthalmology].,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionised ophthalmology.

This review gives an overview on typical changes in OCT for the following diseases: autosomal dominant optic atrophy, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, toxic, traumatic and compressive optic neuropathy, optic nerve drusen, anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, optic disc pit, papilledema, optic neuritis (isolated or associated with multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica), neurodegenerative diseases and hereditary retinal diseases. A diagnosis exclusively based on an OCT examination is not always possible, but in several diseases there are pathognomonic changes that directly lead to the correct diagnosis.

CD008803,0,11880718,0,Optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer analyzers in glaucoma.,"There is mounting evidence that retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) loss precedes detectable visual field loss in early glaucomatous optic neuropathy. However, examination and photography of the RNFL is a difficult technique in many patients, particularly older individuals, and eyes with small pupils and media opacities. It is subjective, qualitative, variably reproducible, and often unreliable. Furthermore, optic nerve head and RNFL photography is time consuming, operator dependent, has limited sensitivity and specificity, and requires storage space. Imaging technologies have emerged which enable clinicians to perform accurate, objective, and quantitative measurements of the RNFL and optic nerve head topography. There is good agreement between such measurements and clinical estimates of optic nerve head structure and visual function. The reproducibility of these instruments suggests that they have the potential to detect structural change over time. This report will review the technological principles, reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity, capacity to detect glaucomatous progression, and limitations of currently available ocular imaging technologies."

CD008803,0,6203209,0,Optic nerve axons and acquired alterations in the appearance of the optic disc.,"The pathophysiologic events in optic nerve axons have recently been recognized as crucial to an understanding of clinically significant acquired alterations in the ophthalmoscopic appearance of the optic disc. Stasis and related abnormalities of axonal transport appear to explain most aspects of optic nerve head swelling, including optic disc drusen and retinal cottonwool spots. Loss of axoplasm and axonal death can be invoked to interpret optic disc pallor, thinning and narrowing of rim tissue, changes in the size and outline of the optic cup, laminar dots, atrophy of the retinal nerve fiber layer, and acquired demyelination and myelination of the retinal nerve fiber layer. It is speculated that the axons may also play a role in the mechanical support of the lamina cribrosa in resisting the pressure gradient across the pars scleralis of the optic nerve head. Axons and their associated glial cells may be involved in those cases where ""reversibility"" of cupping of the optic disc has been reported. The structure, physiology, and experimental pathologic findings of the optic nerve head have been reviewed. Many aspects concerning the final anatomic appearance of the optic nerve head have been explained. However, many questions remain concerning the intermediate mechanisms by which increased intracranial pressure retards the various components of axonal transport in papilledema and by which increased IOP causes axonal loss in glaucoma. Investigation of the molecular biology of axonal constituents and their responses to abnormalities in their physical and chemical milieu could extend our understanding of the events that result from mechanical compression and local ischemia. Moreover, we have identified a need to further explore the role of axons in the pathophysiology of optic disc cupping."

Visual function assessed by pattern electroretinograms (PERGs) reduced by half in EAE showed no significant reductions with NDI1. Serial optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed significant inner retinal thinning with EAE that was suppressed by NDI1. Although complex I activity reduced 80% in EAE was not improved by NDI1, in vivo fluorescent probes indicated mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptosis of the EAE retina were reduced by NDI1. Finally, the 42% loss of axons in the EAE optic nerve was ameliorated by NDI1. Targeting the dysfunctional complex I of EAE responsible for loss of respiration, mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptosis may be a novel approach to address neuronal and axonal loss responsible for permanent disability that is unaltered by current disease modifying drugs for MS that target inflammation."

CD008803,0,24934221,0,Recent advances in OCT imaging of the lamina cribrosa.,"The lamina cribrosa (LC) is believed to be the site of injury to retinal ganglion cell axons in glaucoma. The ability to visualise this structure has the potential to help increase our understanding of the disease and be useful in the early detection of glaucoma. While for many years the research on the LC was essentially dependent on histology and modelling, a number of recent advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) have dramatically improved the ability to visualise the LC, such that it is now possible to image the LC in vivo in humans and animals. In this review, we highlight recent advances in OCT imaging of the LC, in the technology, processing and analysis, and discuss the impact that these will have on the ability to diagnose and monitor glaucoma, as well as to expand our understanding of its pathophysiology. With this manuscript, we aspire to share our excitement on the achievements and potential of recent developments as well as advise caution regarding the challenges that remain before imaging of the LC and optic nerve can be used routinely in clinical practice."

CD008803,0,20207973,0,A comparison of rates of change in neuroretinal rim area and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in progressive glaucoma.,"PURPOSE. To evaluate and compare rates of change in neuroretinal rim area (RA) and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) measurements in glaucoma patients, those with suspected glaucoma, and normal subjects observed over time. METHODS. In this observational cohort study, patients recruited from two longitudinal studies (Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study-DIGS and African Descent and Evaluation Study-ADAGES) were observed with standard achromatic perimetry (SAP), optic disc stereophotographs, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT-3; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), and scanning laser polarimetry (GDx-VCC; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA). Glaucoma progression was determined by the Guided Progression Analysis software for standard automated perimetry [SAP] and by masked assessment of serial optic disc stereophotographs by expert graders. Random-coefficients models were used to evaluate rates of change in average RNFLT and global RA measurements and their relationship with glaucoma progression. RESULTS. At baseline, 194 (31%) eyes were glaucomatous, 347 (55%) had suspected glaucoma, and 88 (14%) were normal. Forty-six (9%) eyes showed progression by SAP and/or stereophotographs, during an average follow-up of 3.3 (+/-0.7) years. The average rate of decline for RNFLT measurements was significantly higher in the progressing group than in the nonprogressing group (-0.65 vs. -0.11 microm/y, respectively; P < 0.001), whereas RA decline was not significantly different between these groups (-0.0058 vs. -0.0073 mm(2)/y, respectively; P = 0.727). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves used to discriminate progressing versus nonprogressing eyes were 0.811 and 0.507 for the rates of change in the RNFLT and RA, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The ability to discriminate eyes with progressing glaucoma by SAP and/or stereophotographs from stable eyes was significantly greater for RNFLT than for RA measurements."

However, age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is the main cause of legal blindness in developed countries. Even today the end stage of this disease can often not be avoided. Patients suffer from central scotoma and severe vision loss. Low vision aids may help in certain situations, but these devices are often functionally and cosmetically inadequate. The implantation of the IOL-Vip system is a new surgical alternative. The lens system consists of a high negative power lens (-64 D) which is implanted in the capsular bag and a high positive power lens (+53 D) which is implanted in the anterior chamber. An intraocular Galilean telescope is reproduced by this arrangement. The IOL-Vip system provides a magnification of 1.3 without notably compromising the peripheral visual field. Investigations have shown that visual improvement can be achieved after implantation of the IOL-Vip system combined with a rehabilitation program. In particular orientation and the ability of patients to perform everyday tasks showed improvement."

The aim of the current study was to determine the thickness changes of retina nerve fibers with optical coherence tomography (OCT) in AD patients. The OCT was used to assess the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) from 22 AD patients and 22 healthy age-matched controls. The corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure were measured and the dilated fundus examination and fundus image acquisition were also performed in those subjects. Compared with healthy age-matched controls, the RNFL thickness of AD patients were much thinner (p<0.05), especially in supra-retina and infra-retina, while no difference was found in the other retinal area. These changes were also confirmed by the fundus images. In conclusion, retinal nerve degeneration is present in the retina of AD patients and this degeneration is likely localized preferentially to the superior and inferior quadrant."

The study enrolled 21 patient (35 eyes) with optic disc drusen, of which 7 (8 eyes) were diagnosed with POAG. Besides the standard tests, the ophthalmological assessment included evaluation of OBF (flowmetry) and an individual normal range of intraocular pressure (IOP). The results showed that optic disc drusen are not associated with OBF changes. Concomitant POAG might be suspected in a patient with optic disc drusen whose OBF is significantly decreased and IOP is above the individual normal range. Differentiation of morphofunctional changes in chronic optic neuropathy, which might be due to either glaucomatous optic neuropathy or optic disc drusen, is complicated when actual IOP lies within the average normal range. Ocular blood flow evaluation by means of flowmetry with calculation of an individual normal range of IOP has been demonstrated as a highly effective predictor of concomitant POAG in patients with optic disc drusen."

CD008803,0,16716639,0,Retinal assessment using optical coherence tomography.,"Over the 15 years since the original description, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become one of the key diagnostic technologies in the ophthalmic subspecialty areas of retinal diseases and glaucoma. The reason for the widespread adoption of this technology originates from at least two properties of the OCT results: on the one hand, the results are accessible to the non-specialist where microscopic retinal abnormalities are grossly and easily noticeable; on the other hand, results are reproducible and exceedingly quantitative in the hands of the specialist. However, as in any other imaging technique in ophthalmology, some artifacts are expected to occur. Understanding of the basic principles of image acquisition and data processing as well as recognition of OCT limitations are crucial issues to using this equipment with cleverness. Herein, we took a brief look in the past of OCT and have explained the key basic physical principles of this imaging technology. In addition, each of the several steps encompassing a third generation OCT evaluation of retinal tissues has been addressed in details. A comprehensive explanation about next generation OCT systems has also been provided and, to conclude, we have commented on the future directions of this exceptional technique."

Nine patients with bilateral advanced primary open-angle glaucoma (glaucoma group) and nine normal control subjects (control group) were included in this pilot observational, prospective, case-control study. The best-corrected visual acuity logMAR, standard automated perimetry mean deviation, and the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness determined by optical coherence tomography and multifocal electroretinography were used to evaluate the changes. Melatonin was analyzed in the saliva by radioimmunoassay before and after exposure to bright light (600 lux) for 60 min at night. The advanced glaucoma group did not have any significant nocturnal melatonin suppression after exposure to bright light (14.28 ± 3.07 pg/ml pre-light melatonin concentration vs. 15.22 ± 3.56 pg/ml after light exposure; p = 0.798) unlike the marked melatonin suppression in the control group (22.43 ± 4.37 pg/ml pre-light melatonin concentration vs. 11.25 ± 1.89 pg/ml after light exposure; p < 0.002). Response density estimates by the scalar product amplitude measure for the interval 0-80 ms of the first-order kernel responses were similar in both groups, indicating that outer retinal function was significantly unchanged in the glaucoma group (5.95 ± 0.54 nV/dg^2) compared with the control group (6.20 ± 0.22 nV/dg^2) (p = 0.689).

CD008803,0,23022957,0,Doppler optical coherence tomography of retinal circulation.,"Noncontact retinal blood flow measurements are performed with a Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) system using a circumpapillary double circular scan (CDCS) that scans around the optic nerve head at 3.40 mm and 3.75 mm diameters. The double concentric circles are performed 6 times consecutively over 2 sec. The CDCS scan is saved with Doppler shift information from which flow can be calculated. The standard clinical protocol calls for 3 CDCS scans made with the OCT beam passing through the superonasal edge of the pupil and 3 CDCS scan through the inferonal pupil. This double-angle protocol ensures that acceptable Doppler angle is obtained on each retinal branch vessel in at least 1 scan. The CDCS scan data, a 3-dimensional volumetric OCT scan of the optic disc scan, and a color photograph of the optic disc are used together to obtain retinal blood flow measurement on an eye. We have developed a blood flow measurement software called ""Doppler optical coherence tomography of retinal circulation"" (DOCTORC). This semi-automated software is used to measure total retinal blood flow, vessel cross section area, and average blood velocity. The flow of each vessel is calculated from the Doppler shift in the vessel cross-sectional area and the Doppler angle between the vessel and the OCT beam. Total retinal blood flow measurement is summed from the veins around the optic disc. The results obtained at our Doppler OCT reading center showed good reproducibility between graders and methods (<10%). Total retinal blood flow could be useful in the management of glaucoma, other retinal diseases, and retinal diseases. In glaucoma patients, OCT retinal blood flow measurement was highly correlated with visual field loss (R(2)>0.57 with visual field pattern deviation). Doppler OCT is a new method to perform rapid, noncontact, and repeatable measurement of total retinal blood flow using widely available Fourier-domain OCT instrumentation. This new technology may improve the practicality of making these measurements in clinical studies and routine clinical practice."

We aimed to determine retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume in pediatric patients, with and without optic neuritis and their relations with visual evoked potentials. We also examined macular volume changes at month 12. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness of all quadrants and macular volume were measured in 28 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis eyes and 30 control eyes using optical coherence tomography and were found reduced in patients compared with controls. This reduction was more prominent in eyes with longer time interval from optic neuritis. Retinal nerve fiber thickness was lower in eyes with delayed visual evoked potentials. Visual evoked potential amplitudes were reduced in affected eyes compared to patients without optic neuritis. Macular volume reduced nonsignificantly in patients at month 12. Retinal atrophy occurs in pediatric multiple sclerosis, and previous optic neuritis accelerates this atrophy."

OBJECTIVE To use the results of the present natural history study of patients with G11778A LHON to plan a gene therapy clinical trial that will use allotopic expression by delivering a normal nuclear-encoded ND4 gene into the nuclei of retinal ganglion cells via an adeno-associated virus vector injected into the vitreous. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective observational study initiated in 2008 was conducted in primary and referral institutional practice settings. Participants included 44 individuals with G11778A LHON, recruited between September 2008 and March 2012, who were evaluated every 6 months and returned for 1 or more follow-up visits (6-36 months) as of August 2012. EXPOSURES Complete neuro-ophthalmic examination and main measures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Visual acuity, automated visual field testing, pattern electroretinogram, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. RESULTS Clinical measures were stable during the follow-up period, and visual acuity was as good as or better than the other visual factors used for monitoring patients. Based on a criterion of 15 or more letters from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart, 13 eyes of 8 patients (18%) improved, but 24 months after the onset of symptoms, any further improvements were to no better than 20/100. Acuity recovery occurred in some patients despite continued marked retinal nerve fiber layer thinning indistinguishable from that in patients who did not recover visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Spontaneous improvement of visual acuity in patients with G11778A LHON is not common and is partial and limited when it occurs, so improvements in vision with adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapy of a synthetic wild-type ND4 subunit gene should be possible to detect with a reasonable sample size. Visual acuity appears to be the most suitable primary end point for the planned clinical trial."

The most common presenting symptoms were decreased vision and transient visual obscurations. In the earliest stages, many patients presented with normal to mildly impaired acuity (despite subjectively decreased vision), optic disc edema and enlargement of the blind spot. Optic disc edema was frequently associated with refractile bodies indicative of chronic swelling. Optic disc edema preceded the development of optic atrophy. Another group of patients presented with a history of longstanding vision loss, visual acuity of 20/200 or worse and optic atrophy. Optociliary shunt vessels were late findings only seen in five patients. The most consistent visual field abnormality was peripheral constriction. Cecocentral scotomas were uncommon. Intracranial involvement was present in five patients. There were two patients with bilateral optic nerve sheath meningiomas without CT evidence of intracranial involvement.

CD008803,0,20130282,0,Decreased retinal ganglion cell layer thickness in patients with type 1 diabetes.,"PURPOSE. To determine which retinal layers are most affected by diabetes and contribute to thinning of the inner retina and to investigate the relationship between retinal layer thickness (LT) and diabetes duration, diabetic retinopathy (DR) status, age, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the sex of the individual, in patients with type 1 diabetes who have no or minimal DR. METHODS. Mean LT was calculated for the individual retinal layers after automated segmentation of spectral domain-optical coherence tomography scans of patients with diabetes and compared with that in control subjects. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between LT and HbA1c, age, sex, diabetes duration, and DR status. RESULTS. In patients with minimal DR, the mean ganglion cell layer (GCL) in the pericentral area was 5.1 mum thinner (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-9.1 mum), and in the peripheral macula, the mean retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) was 3.7 mum thinner (95% CI, 1.3-6.1 mum) than in the control subjects. There was a significant linear correlation (R = 0.53, P < 0.01) between GCL thickness and diabetes duration in the pooled group of patients. Multiple linear regression analysis (R = 0.62, P < 0.01) showed that DR status was the most important explanatory variable. CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrates GCL thinning in the pericentral area and corresponding loss of RNFL thickness in the peripheral macula in patients with type 1 diabetes and no or minimal DR compared with control subjects. These results support the concept that diabetes has an early neurodegenerative effect on the retina, which occurs even though the vascular component of DR is minimal."

CD008803,0,10025513,0,Ophthalmoscopic evaluation of the optic nerve head.,"Optic nerve diseases, such as the glaucomas, lead to changes in the intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head. These changes can be described by the following variables: size and shape of the optic disk; size, shape, and pallor of the neuroretinal rim; size of the optic cup in relation to the area of the disk; configuration and depth of the optic cup; ratios of cup-to-disk diameter and cup-to-disk area; position of the exit of the central retinal vessel trunk on the lamina cribrosa surface; presence and location of splinter-shaped hemorrhages; occurrence, size, configuration, and location of parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy; diffuse and/or focal decrease of the diameter of the retinal arterioles; and visibility of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). These variables can be assessed semiquantitively by ophthalmoscopy without applying sophisticated techniques. For the early detection of glaucomatous optic nerve damage in ocular hypertensive eyes before the development of visual field loss, the most important variables are neuroretinal rim shape, optic cup size in relation to optic disk size, diffusely or segmentally decreased visibility of the RNFL, occurrence of localized RNFL defects, and presence of disk hemorrhages."

Our study was conducted in 591 consecutive patients (749 eyes) with NA-AION who fulfilled our inclusion criteria. On their first visit to our clinic, all patients had a detailed ophthalmic and medical history, a comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation, and stereoscopic color fundus photography and fluorescein fundus angiography. On each follow-up visit, the same ophthalmic evaluation was performed, except for fluorescein fundus angiography. The effect of steroid therapy on ODE was evaluated in a ""patient choice study"" in 723 eyes, i.e., patients who voluntarily opted to have (343 eyes) or not have (380 eyes) this therapy. To identify the factors that influence time to ODE resolution, parametric regression models for interval-censored data were fitted by maximum likelihood estimation using an SAS procedure. Our results indicate that the overall median time (25-75th percentile) to spontaneous resolution of ODE from the onset of visual loss was 7.9 (5.8-11.4) weeks. The ODE resolution time was longer in diabetics than in non-diabetics (p = 0.003) in the single factor model. Multi-factor analysis showed that worse initial visual field defects (p < 0.0001) and worse visual acuity (p = 0.04) were associated with a faster resolution of ODE. Those treated with steroid therapy within 2 weeks after onset of NA-AION had significantly (p = 0.0006) faster ODE resolution than untreated cases. Severity of initial visual loss and systemic diseases were identical in steroid treated and untreated patients. A characteristic evolutionary pattern of ODE in NA-AION was observed. In conclusion, our study showed that in NA-AION the time course for resolution of ODE is shorter with greater severity of initial visual field and visual acuity loss, which may relate to the number of axons permanently damaged during the acute stage. Steroid therapy was associated with shorter time to resolution of ODE. Resolution of ODE goes through a characteristic evolutionary process."
CD008803,0,24369534,0,High-resolution en face images of microcystic macular edema in patients with autosomal dominant optic atrophy.,The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of microcystic macular edema (MME) determined from the en face images obtained by an adaptive optics (AO) fundus camera in patients with autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) and to try to determine the mechanisms underlying the degeneration of the inner retinal cells and RNFL by using the advantage of AO. Six patients from 4 families with ADOA underwent detailed ophthalmic examinations including spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Mutational screening of all coding and flanking intron sequences of the OPA1 gene was performed by DNA sequencing. SD-OCT showed a severe reduction in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in all patients. A new splicing defect and two new frameshift mutations with premature termination of the Opa1 protein were identified in three families. A reported nonsense mutation was identified in one family. SD-OCT of one patient showed MME in the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the retina. AO images showed microcysts in the en face images of the INL. Our data indicate that AO is a useful method to identify MME in neurodegenerative diseases and may also help determine the mechanisms underlying the degeneration of the inner retinal cells and RNFL.

Refraction and keratometry were measured by means of the autorefractometer. The following topographic parameters of the ONH were tested: disc area, rim area and cup area, cup/disc ratio, rim/disc ratio, rim volume, cup volume, mean and maximum cup depth, height variation contour, cup shape measure, mean RNFL thickness and RNFL cross sectional area. Influence of gender on the topographic parameters of the ONH was not found. The age significantly influenced values of the disc area, rim area, rim volume and RNFL cross sectional area. Refraction significantly influenced the parameters disc area and rim area, keratometry significantly correlated with the disc area and cup shape measure. Disc area significantly influenced most parameters of the ONH (cup area, rim area, C/D ratio, R/D ratio, cup volume, rim volume, mean and maximum cup depth, cup shape measure, RNFL cross sectional area).

The aim of this experiment is to examine relapse rate and long-term outcome in IIH patients. The methods involved in this experiment include a prospective controlled study of 18 newly diagnosed IIH patients followed for a mean observation period of 21.1 (±8.0) months. Treatment regime included diuretics, dietary recommendations and check-up visits at a dietician. Baseline and follow-up included neurological examination, detailed headache history and comprehensive neuro-ophthalmological examination, including fundus photography, Humphrey visual fields, and measurement of the retinal thickness (RT) and retinal nerve fiber layers (RNFL) by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Relapse was defined as recurrence of either: (1) papilledema or (2) symptoms and demonstrated raised ICP. The result of this experiment is that relapse was found in 28%. Visual function improved from baseline to follow-up and was generally favorable. In patients without relapse of papilledema RT and RNFL were significantly thinner than in healthy controls (p = 0.003 and 0.02), although atrophy was clinically detectable in only one patient. Headache was still present in 67% of the patients at follow-up. Headache was heterogenic and unrelated to relapse. After an initial reduction, weight increased again in the relapse group compared to reduced weight in the non-relapse group (p = 0.013). Thus, the conclusions drawn are that headache was persistent, difficult to classify, and equally represented in relapse and non-relapse patients. Headache was thus a poor marker of active disease. Relapse rate was high and clinically undetectable optic disc atrophy was discovered in apparently well treated IIH patients."

CD008803,0,24518436,0,Optical coherence tomography in Parkinson's disease: is the retina a biomarker?,"Visual symptoms are a common feature in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and retinal dopamine loss and dysfunctions in foveal vision have been described in PD patients. Because visual hallucination (VH) is a specific feature of PD which is differentiated from other parkinsonian disorders, defective visual information processing from both the central and peripheral pathways is suggested to be the pathophysiological mechanisms of VH in PD. Decreased visual acuity as well as impaired contrast sensitivity and color vision is known to be related to the appearance of VH in PD. However, these functional studies were also affected by cognitive or cortical dysfunctions; thus, structural imaging can more reliably reflect visual afferent dysfunction. Recently, optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans have been used to investigate the structural changes in the retina in vivo. Segmental measures of the vertical retinal layers by OCT provide structural evidence for retinal dopamine loss and foveal dysfunction in PD. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning in PD was shown to be significantly associated with VH and correlated with PD duration and severity. Thus, there is a possibility that the retina could be a biomarker for disease progression and risk of VH in PD. A standard protocol for OCT studies in PD with more accurate measures of the retinal layers needs to be developed in the future."

Results of laser scanning were recorded on videotape and analysed independently. Scanning (both eyes) took under 5 minutes per patient. For the 113 eyes studied, the two techniques gave concordant results in 73/113 (65%). Where there was discordance, laser ophthalmoscopic severity was greater than direct ophthalmoscopy in 36/40 (90% of discordant results). In 4/40 eyes conventional ophthalmoscopic appearances were judged more severe than those seen with the laser. The laser ophthalmoscope may have value as a method of assessing diabetic retinopathy, but further work is required to evaluate its efficacy as a screening tool in patients with moderate to severe retinopathy."

We hypothesized that these can be estimated numerically from ocular parameters measurable in vivo with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Using parametric models representing human ONHs we simulated acute intraocular pressure (IOP) increases (10 mmHg). Statistical models were fit to predict, from OCT-measurable parameters, 15 outputs, including ONH tissue properties, stresses, and deformations. The calculations were repeated adding parameters that have recently been proposed as potentially measurable with OCT. We evaluated the sensitivity of the predictions to variations in the experimental parameters. Excellent fits were obtained to predict all outputs from the experimental parameters, with cross-validated R2s between 0.957 and 0.998. Incorporating the potentially measurable parameters improved fits significantly. Predictions of tissue stiffness were accurate to within 0.66 MPa for the sclera and 0.24 MPa for the lamina cribrosa. Predictions of strains and stresses were accurate to within 0.62% and 4.9 kPa, respectively. Estimates of ONH biomechanics and tissue properties can be obtained quickly from OCT measurements using an applet that we make freely available. These estimates may improve understanding of the eye sensitivity to IOP and assessment of patient risk for development or progression of glaucoma."

The morphological characteristics of the optic nerve (provided by a Heidelberg, HRT II retinotomograph) were compared with the functional impairments of various canals of light, color, and contrast sensitivities (detected by an Offon programme complex, MBN, Moscow). There were decreases in contrast and color sensitivities just at the early stages of the disease and deteriorated functions of contract and color sensitivity canals as optic neuropathy progressed. The HRT II retinotomograph has shown a significant change in the thickness of optic nerve fibers, the area of the optic disk (OD), and the volume of the neuroretinal ring, which corresponds to the magnitude of clinical manifestations and the severity of OD lesion. The first retinal changes appear long before optic nerve compression at the orbital apex (orbital apex syndrome), which are caused by ischemic and hypoxic processes due to orbital soft tissue edema. The most sensitive test in detecting the latent stage of optic neuropathy in EOP is a color and contrast sensitivity topography test. In EOP, the morphological optic nerve changes correlate with functional impairments in different canals of the visual system, reflecting the stage of the disease."

We reviewed the medical records of the patients who underwent MH surgery with internal limiting membrane peeling. The cases were then selected using three principal criteria: (1) surgeries performed by the same surgeon (S. K.), (2) pre- and postoperative Cirrus HD-OCT imaging, and (3) minimal follow-up of 3 months. All cases received a complete ophthalmologic examination. The presence/absence of a DONFL appearance was determined using a retinal surface image provided by Cirrus HD-OCT. Color fundus photographs were also used for determination if available. Fifteen cases met the criteria. A DONFL appearance was identified in 11 (73%) cases during the postoperative course by retinal surface imaging. A DONFL appearance was not detected in any OCT retinal surface image within the first postoperative month, gradually became distinct between 1 and 3 months after surgery, and remained detectable thereafter in all cases but one whose DONFL appearance became less detectable at 12 months. Indentations of the innermost retinal layer became apparent on cross-sectional OCT images as a DONFL appearance developed on OCT retinal surface images. There were two cases in which the DONFL appearance was not observed on color fundus photographs but detected on OCT retinal surface images. Retinal surface imaging provided by Cirrus HD-OCT appeared to be a promising option in evaluating a DONFL appearance after MH surgery."
CD008803,0,24835184,0,Probabilistic intra-retinal layer segmentation in 3-D OCT images using global shape regularization.,"With the introduction of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), resulting in a significant increase in acquisition speed, the fast and accurate segmentation of 3-D OCT scans has become evermore important. This paper presents a novel probabilistic approach, that models the appearance of retinal layers as well as the global shape variations of layer boundaries. Given an OCT scan, the full posterior distribution over segmentations is approximately inferred using a variational method enabling efficient probabilistic inference in terms of computationally tractable model components: Segmenting a full 3-D volume takes around a minute. Accurate segmentations demonstrate the benefit of using global shape regularization: We segmented 35 fovea-centered 3-D volumes with an average unsigned error of 2.46 ± 0.22 μm as well as 80 normal and 66 glaucomatous 2-D circular scans with errors of 2.92 ± 0.5 μm and 4.09 ± 0.98 μm respectively. Furthermore, we utilized the inferred posterior distribution to rate the quality of the segmentation, point out potentially erroneous regions and discriminate normal from pathological scans. No pre- or postprocessing was required and we used the same set of parameters for all data sets, underlining the robustness and out-of-the-box nature of our approach."
CD008803,0,10981779,0,Fred Hollows lecture: digital screening for eye disease.,"The purpose of this study was to explore progress, in the adaptation to community screening for blinding eye disease, of digital imaging devices and technology for storage and transmission. Available imaging systems were compared to gold standard clinical photography in terms of sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of common blinding eye conditions. Since the use of expensive non-portable imaging devices is likely to be limited for widespread community screening purposes, a portable fundus camera (Nidek, Chiyoda-ku, Japan) and a prototype monocular digital indirect ophthalmoscope constructed at the Lions Eye Institute (LEI) were selected for comparative trials for the screening of optic disc cupping, glaucoma and clinical signs of diabetic retinopathy. Fifty-one eyes of 27 consecutive patients being assessed at the LEI clinic for glaucoma were dilated and photographed with a Zeiss retinal camera, and digital images were taken with the portable Nidek NM100 fundus camera (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) or with a prototype digital monocular indirect ophthalmoscope. Vertical cup: disc ratios (VCDR) were measured on the disc photographs by one ophthalmologist while three other clinicians were presented with compressed digital images in random order to estimate VCDR. Field trials were also carried out to demonstrate the practicality of compression, local storage and then transmission by mobile telephone ISDN lines and satellite, of optic discs and fundus images of patients with diabetes in either rural Western Australia or Surabaya, Indonesia. Kappa values of correlations of measurement of agreement between measured and estimated VCDR were 0.87, 0.45 and 0.84, respectively, for the three observers, corresponding to a specificity of 79-97% and a sensitivity of 70-95%. The portable Nidek fundus camera was also assessed for specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy in comparison to standard Zeiss fundus camera photographs. Of 49 eyes in 25 consecutive patients attending the LEI clinic for assessment of diabetic retinopathy, three ophthalmologists assessed photographs and images in random order. When used for screening diabetic retinopathy, the digital images of the Nidek camera were graded as adequate quality in only 56% of eyes compared to 93% of the photographs. The kappa value of agreement in analysis of diabetic retinopathy was only 0.30. The prototype digital monocular indirect ophthalmoscope compared favourably with the Nidek camera. At 1:5 compression, images of size 36 kB transmitted from Surabaya to Perth took 29 s on the mobile telephone, while uncompressed images took 170 s. Images compressed 1:5 were transmitted in 60 s using the satellite telephone, while the uncompressed images took 240 s. Satellite transmission was more expensive but the lines were more stable than telephone connections from Indonesia. Digital imaging is becoming a powerful tool for ophthalmology in clinical records, teaching and research, and interoffice diagnostic opinions. It also has enormous potential for community screening for blinding eye diseases, such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Inexpensive portable imaging devices that are easy to use, and on which local health workers might be trained, must be developed and validated in terms of sensitivity and specificity of performance. The technology of image capture, image compression, transmission, data base storage and analysis is rapidly evolving and becoming less expensive."

At present, the morphological and morphometric analysis of the optic disk is considered very important for an early diagnosis and follow-up of the disease. The recent introduction of laser systems equipped with new polarimetry techniques (GDx) and confocal tomography (HRT) allows an objective, quantitative, and reproducible evaluation of the morphometry and morphology of the optic disk and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). The GDx, scanning laser polarimetry, studies the RNFL. The HRT, confocal scanning laser tomography, examines several optic disk and peripapillar area parameters. These devices allow obtaining objective and quantitative data concerning RNFL and optic nerve head. They represent complementary and important examinations in case of uncertain POAG diagnosis. The correct evaluation of the parameters studied by these techniques and the knowledge of the instruments' limits are needed for an adequate interpretation of the results obtained."

The method draws upon an analogy with a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. By exploiting mathematical similarities between the expressions for aberration in optical imaging and dispersion mismatch in spectral / Fourier domain OCT, Shack-Hartmann principles can be extended from the two-dimensional paraxial wavevector space (or the x-y plane in the spatial domain) to the one-dimensional wavenumber space (or the z-axis in the spatial domain). For OCT imaging of the retina, different retinal layers, such as the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), the photoreceptor inner and outer segment junction (IS/OS), or all the retinal layers near the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) can be used as point source beacons in the axial direction, analogous to point source beacons used in conventional two-dimensional Shack-Hartman wavefront sensors for aberration characterization. Subtleties regarding speckle phenomena in optical imaging, which affect the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor used in adaptive optics, also occur analogously in this application. Using this approach and carefully suppressing speckle, the dispersion mismatch in spectral / Fourier domain OCT retinal imaging can be successfully extracted numerically and used for numerical dispersion compensation to generate sharper, ultrahigh-resolution OCT images."

On fundus photographs taken at a median age of 5.4 y, the optic discs were evaluated using digital image analysis and compared with those of a control group (n = 203). The results were analyzed in relation to gestational age, birth weight (BW) SD score (SDS), IGF-1 weight at postmenstrual age 32 wk (SDS), and weight, length, and head circumference (SDS) at follow-up. The preterm children's optic disc and neuronal rim areas were smaller than in the control group. Low BW (SDS) and weight at wk 32 (SDS) were associated with larger area of the optic cup and reduced neuronal rim area. Preterm children with known brain lesions (n = 6) had significantly larger cups than preterm children without known brain lesions. The association found between both low BW and poor early growth and later reduced neuronal tissue of the optic nerve indicate that early weight gain is important for neural development in preterm children."

In particular, auditory-visual cross-modal plasticity occurs, wherein redundant auditory cortex becomes recruited to vision. However, the effect of human deafness on neural structures involved in visual processing prior to the visual cortex has never been investigated, either in humans or animals. We investigated neural changes at the retina and optic nerve head in profoundly deaf (N = 14) and hearing (N = 15) adults using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), an in-vivo light interference method of quantifying retinal micro-structure. We compared retinal changes with behavioural results from the same deaf and hearing adults, measuring sensitivity in the peripheral visual field using Goldmann perimetry. Deaf adults had significantly larger neural rim areas, within the optic nerve head in comparison to hearing controls suggesting greater retinal ganglion cell number. Deaf adults also demonstrated significantly larger visual field areas (indicating greater peripheral sensitivity) than controls. Furthermore, neural rim area was significantly correlated with visual field area in both deaf and hearing adults. Deaf adults also showed a significantly different pattern of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) distribution compared to controls. Significant correlations between the depth of the RNFL at the inferior-nasal peripapillary retina and the corresponding far temporal and superior temporal visual field areas (sensitivity) were found. Our results show that cross-modal plasticity after early onset deafness may not be limited to the sensory cortices, noting specific retinal adaptations in early onset deaf adults which are significantly correlated with peripheral vision sensitivity."

The purpose of this work was to demonstrate that patients with amnestic MCI show an intermediate RNFL thickness between normality and AD, and a macular volume and thickness as well. In a cross-sectional study we consecutively recruited 18 patients with AD, 21 with MCI, and 41 healthy controls. OCT was performed in all of them to measure circumpapillary RNFL thickness in µm, as well as macular volume and thickness. In the analysis of variance we saw that RNFL was thinner in MCI patients compared with controls, and it was also thinner in AD patients compared with MCI patients and controls. With regard to the macular measurements in mm(3), MCI patients had the greatest macular volume in comparison with AD patients and controls. In turn the controls had greater macular volume than AD patients. The decreased RNFL thickness in MCI and AD patients suggests loss of retinal neurons and their axons. The increased thickness and macular volume have never been reported before in aMCI. This finding could be explained by inflammation and/or gliosis in early stages of AD. OCT could be a useful marker of AD for early detection and monitoring progression."

We propose a technique to obtain the depth value from the stereo retinal fundus image pair, which mainly consists of five steps: 1. cutout of the ONH region from the stereo retinal fundus image pair, 2. registration of the stereo image pair, 3. disparity measurement, 4. noise reduction, and 5. quantitative depth calculation. Depth measurements of 12 normal eyes are performed using the stereo fundus camera and the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT), which is a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The depth values of the ONH obtained from the stereo retinal fundus image pair were in good accordance with the value obtained using HRT (r=0.80+/-0.15).

CD008803,0,25448921,0,Imaging retinal ganglion cells: enabling experimental technology for clinical application.,"Recent advances in clinical ophthalmic imaging have enhanced patient care. However, the ability to differentiate retinal neurons, such as retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), would advance many areas within ophthalmology, including the screening and monitoring of glaucoma and other optic neuropathies. Imaging at the single cell level would take diagnostics to the next level. Experimental methods have provided techniques and insight into imaging RGCs, however no method has yet to be translated to clinical application. This review provides an overview of the importance of non-invasive imaging of RGCs and the clinically relevant capabilities. In addition, we report on experimental data from wild-type mice that received an in vivo intravitreal injection of a neuronal tracer that labelled RGCs, which in turn were monitored for up to 100 days post-injection with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. We were able to demonstrate efficient and consistent RGC labelling with this delivery method and discuss the issue of cell specificity. This type of experimental work is important in progressing towards clinically applicable methods for monitoring loss of RGCs in glaucoma and other optic neuropathies. We discuss the challenges to translating these findings to clinical application and how this method of tracking RGCs in vivo could provide valuable structural and functional information to clinicians."

CD008803,0,25020067,0,Multi-surface and multi-field co-segmentation of 3-D retinal optical coherence tomography.,"When segmenting intraretinal layers from multiple optical coherence tomography (OCT) images forming a mosaic or a set of repeated scans, it is attractive to exploit the additional information from the overlapping areas rather than discarding it as redundant, especially in low contrast and noisy images. However, it is currently not clear how to effectively combine the multiple information sources available in the areas of overlap. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-theoretic method for multi-surface multi-field co-segmentation of intraretinal layers, assuring consistent segmentation of the fields across the overlapped areas. After 2-D en-face alignment, all the fields are segmented simultaneously, imposing a priori soft interfield-intrasurface constraints for each pair of overlapping fields. The constraints penalize deviations from the expected surface height differences, taken to be the depth-axis shifts that produce the maximum cross-correlation of pairwise-overlapped areas. The method's accuracy and reproducibility are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on 212 OCT images (20 nine-field, 32 single-field acquisitions) from 26 patients with glaucoma. Qualitatively, the obtained thickness maps show no stitching artifacts, compared to pronounced stitches when the fields are segmented independently. Quantitatively, two ophthalmologists manually traced four intraretinal layers on 10 patients, and the average error ( 4.58 ±1.46 μm) was comparable to the average difference between the observers ( 5.86±1.72 μm). Furthermore, we show the benefit of the proposed approach in co-segmenting longitudinal scans. As opposed to segmenting layers in each of the fields independently, the proposed co-segmentation method obtains consistent segmentations across the overlapped areas, producing accurate, reproducible, and artifact-free results."

CD008803,0,25333185,0,Automated 3D segmentation of multiple surfaces with a shared hole: segmentation of the neural canal opening in SD-OCT volumes.,"The need to segment multiple interacting surfaces is a common problem in medical imaging and it is often assumed that such surfaces are continuous within the confines of the region of interest. However, in some application areas, the surfaces of interest may contain a shared hole in which the surfaces no longer exist and the exact location of the hole boundary is not known a priori. The boundary of the neural canal opening seen in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volumes is an example of a ""hole"" embedded with multiple surrounding surfaces. Segmentation approaches that rely on finding the surfaces alone are prone to failures as deeper structures within the hole can ""attract"" the surfaces and pull them away from their correct location at the hole boundary. With this application area in mind, we present a graph-theoretic approach for segmenting multiple surfaces with a shared hole. The overall cost function that is optimized consists of both the costs of the surfaces outside the hole and the cost of boundary of the hole itself. The constraints utilized were appropriately adapted in order to ensure the smoothness of the hole boundary in addition to ensuring the smoothness of the non-overlapping surfaces. By using this approach, a significant improvement was observed over a more traditional two-pass approach in which the surfaces are segmented first (assuming the presence of no hole) followed by segmenting the neural canal opening."

CD008803,0,23775342,0,Analysis of the visual system in Friedreich ataxia.,"To use optical coherence tomography (OCT) and contrast letter acuity to characterize vision loss in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). High- and low-contrast letter acuity and neurological measures were assessed in 507 patients with FRDA. In addition, OCT was performed on 63 FRDA patients to evaluate retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular thickness. Both OCT and acuity measures were analyzed in relation to genetic severity, neurologic function, and other disease features. High- and low-contrast letter acuity was significantly predicted by age and GAA repeat length, and highly correlated with neurological outcomes. When tested by OCT, 52.7% of eyes (n = 110) had RNFL thickness values below the fifth percentile for age-matched controls. RNFL thickness was significantly lowest for those with worse scores on the Friedreich ataxia rating scale (FARS), worse performance measure composite Z2 scores, and lower scores for high- and low-contrast acuity. In linear regression analysis, GAA repeat length and age independently predicted RNFL thickness. In a subcohort of participants, 21% of eyes from adult subjects (n = 29 eyes) had macular thickness values below the first percentile for age-matched controls, suggesting that macular abnormalities can also be present in FRDA. Low-contrast acuity and RNFL thickness capture visual and neurologic function in FRDA, and reflect genetic severity and disease progression independently. This suggests that such measures are useful markers of neurologic progression in FRDA."
CD008803,0,21114054,0,[Ocular intolerance to antiglaucoma medications is underestimated].,"Since about 20 years, the large panel of the antiglaucoma eyedrops has drastically changed the management of glaucoma. Indications for filtering surgery had decreased in frequency. A great number of patients are controlled only by medications. However ocular intolerance and side effects have been reported until in 50% of the cases with 10% of severe manifestations of intolerance. Ocular side effects to topical medications may very often alter compliance. Ocular intolerance had been shown to be secondary to immunological mechanisms and direct or indirect toxicity. The immunological or allergic mechanisms are induced by a type I or IV hypersensibility and only represent 3% to 10% of all the side effects induced by topical medications. Toxic effect can be a direct through different mechanisms: pure toxic effect, acid pH, osmolarity of the solution, photosensibilisation. This will induce inflammatory reaction that will produce fibrosis in the long term. This toxic effect can be worsened by eye dryness or rosacea. Toxicity can also be indirect through an alteration of the conjunctival microbial flora and/or the lacrymal secretion. Concomitant obstruction of the lacrymal ducts may also contribute to this effect. These mechanisms could have been elucidated thank to histological studies from conjunctival mark, and more recently with confocal HRT, which gives an analysis of the ocular surface in vivo. Appropriate and early detection of intolerance to antiglaucoma medications is mandatory to adjust management strategies accordingly. These are based on the suppression or the reduction of conservative agents whenever possible, the use of fixed combinations, the reduction of the number of the instillations and the associated treatment of the ocular surface."

Images are typically acquired with a circular scan around the optic nerve head. Accurate registration of OCT scans is essential for measurement reproducibility and longitudinal examination. This study developed and evaluated a special image registration algorithm to align the location of the OCT scan circles to the vessel features in the retina using probabilistic modelling that was optimised by an expectation-maximization algorithm. Evaluation of the method on 18 patients undergoing large number of scans indicated improved data acquisition and better reproducibility of measured RNFLT when scanning circles were closely matched. The proposed method enables clinicians to consider the RNFLT measurement and its scan circle location on the retina in tandem, reducing RNFLT measurement variability and assisting detection of real change of RNFLT in the longitudinal assessment of glaucoma."

RNFL and MV are promising biomarkers in neurological diseases. This study explores the potential of RNFL and MV to detect axonal abnormalities in vivo in schizophrenia and their correlations with clinical features. OCT was performed in 49 patients (38 schizophrenia, 11 schizoaffective disorder) and 40 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Group comparisons were made between whole retina and quadrant RNFL thickness and MV using multi-level analyses. In patients, associations were sought between RNFL and MV with symptom severity (positive/negative). Patients and controls had similar whole retina RNFL thickness (p=0.86) and MV (p=0.64), but RNFL in the right nasal quadrant of the schizoaffective group was thinner than in the schizophrenia group (p=0.02). In patients, positive symptom severity was associated with smaller MV (right β=-0.54, p=0.02; left β=-0.49, p=0.04). Normal MV and RNFL thickness suggests unmyelinated axons in patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder remain unaffected. Longitudinal studies using higher resolution OCT will clarify whether progressive RNFL and MV changes occur and whether they can be used as state or trait markers in schizophrenia."

Meta-analyses of data for time domain OCT show RNFL thinning of 20.38 microm (95% CI 17.91-22.86, n=2063, p<0.0001) after optic neuritis in MS, and of 7.08 microm (5.52-8.65, n=3154, p<0.0001) in MS without optic neuritis. The estimated RNFL thinning in patients with MS is greater than the extent expected in normal ageing, probably because of retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration and progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, in addition to the more pronounced thinning caused by optic neuritis if present. RNFL thickness correlates with visual and neurological functioning as well as with paraclinical data. Developments that could improve understanding of the relation between structure and function in MS pathophysiology include spectral or Fourier domain OCT technology, polarisation-sensitive OCT, fluorescence labelling, structural assessment of action-potential propagation, and segmentation algorithms allowing quantitative assessment of retinal layers."

CD008803,0,12585705,0,A contribution of image processing to the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy--detection of exudates in color fundus images of the human retina.,"In the framework of computer assisted diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, a new algorithm for detection of exudates is presented and discussed. The presence of exudates within the macular region is a main hallmark of diabetic macular edema and allows its detection with a high sensitivity. Hence, detection of exudates is an important diagnostic task, in which computer assistance may play a major role. Exudates are found using their high grey level variation, and their contours are determined by means of morphological reconstruction techniques. The detection of the optic disc is indispensable for this approach. We detect the optic disc by means of morphological filtering techniques and the watershed transformation. The algorithm has been tested on a small image data base and compared with the performance of a human grader. As a result, we obtain a mean sensitivity of 92.8% and a mean predictive value of 92.4%. Robustness with respect to changes of the parameters of the algorithm has been evaluated."

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of papilledema in syndromic craniosynostosis, to evaluate the results of the treatment, and to examine the risk factors. This is a retrospective study on 84 patients with Apert, Crouzon, or Pfeiffer syndrome. Papilledema was defined as blurring of the margins of the optic disk. The association between clinical symptoms, beaten-copper pattern on skull radiograph, ventricular dilatation on computed tomography scan, and papilledema was assessed. Papilledema was present in 51% of the patients. No relation between specific clinical symptoms and papilledema was found. The significant associations were complex craniosynostosis, exorbitism, and ventricular dilatation. The prevalence of papilledema in patients with Apert, Crouzon, or Pfeiffer syndrome is high, not only before cranial decompression but also after vault expansion. Annual fundoscopy is recommended to screen for papilledema. We consider that early decompressive surgery (within the first year of age) prevents the development of papilledema and, most likely, elevated intracranial pressure."

Central corneal thickness should be measured, since a thin cornea is a risk factor of progression toward glaucomatous neuropathy. Later, the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibers should be tested (HRT, GDx, and OCT), to determine whether the ocular hypertension is associated with other findings, and visual field analysis should be carried out (standard automated perimetry, blue-yellow perimetry, FDT), completed by a search for associated risk factors.

The proximity of the optic disk has also been shown to be a risk factor in several studies. A review of the literature showed that these factors that make the nevus suspicious are associated with a risk of malignant transformation and metastasis, which is correlated to the number of risk factors present at diagnosis. This is why it is important to recommend close follow-up of these lesions with a check-up every 3 months (and radiotherapeutic treatment in case of growth) or early treatment if there are several risk factors and if the lesion is away from the posterior pole."

CD008803,0,20226873,0,Linking structure and function in glaucoma.,"The glaucomas are a group of relatively common optic neuropathies, in which the pathological loss of retinal ganglion cells causes a progressive loss of sight and associated alterations in the retinal nerve fiber layer and optic nerve head. The diagnosis and management of glaucoma are often dependent on methods of clinical testing that either, 1) identify and quantify patterns of functional visual abnormality, or 2) quantify structural abnormality in the retinal nerve fiber layer, both of which are caused by loss of retinal ganglion cells. Although it is evident that the abnormalities in structure and function should be correlated, propositions to link losses in structure and function in glaucoma have been formulated only recently. The present report describes an attempt to build a model of these linking propositions using data from investigations of the relationships between losses of visual sensitivity and thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer over progressive stages of glaucoma severity. A foundation for the model was laid through the pointwise relationships between visual sensitivities (behavioral perimetry in monkeys with experimental glaucoma) and histological analyses of retinal ganglion cell densities in corresponding retinal locations. The subsequent blocks of the model were constructed from clinical studies of aging in normal human subjects and of clinical glaucoma in patients to provide a direct comparison of the results from standard clinical perimetry and optical coherence tomography. The final formulation is a nonlinear structure-function model that was evaluated by the accuracy and precision of translating visual sensitivities in a region of the visual field to produce a predicted thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer in the peripapillary sector that corresponded to the region of reduced visual sensitivity. The model was tested on two independent patient populations, with results that confirmed the predictive relationship between the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and visual sensitivities from clinical perimetry. Thus, the proposed model for linking structure and function in glaucoma has provided information that is important in understanding the results of standard clinical testing and the neuronal losses caused by glaucoma, which may have clinical application for inter-test comparisons of the stage of disease."

CD008803,0,19417237,0,The segmentation of zones with increased autofluorescence in the junctional zone of parapapillary atrophy.,"The autofluorescence (AF) derived from the retinal pigment epithelium has the potential to be used as a feature for early glaucoma diagnosis. The aim of this paper is to design and evaluate the method used for semi-automatic segmentation of the zones with increased autofluorescence. A randomized sample of 20 patients (age: 56 +/- 10 years) with open angle glaucoma was used. A new method for semi-automatic detection and segmentation of the zones with a higher level of autofluorescence in the junctional zone of parapapillary atrophy has been evaluated. Good agreement has been observed between manually and semi-automatically segmented zones for most of the images, but higher differences may occur for larger hyperfluorescent regions. The data were evaluated using the limits of agreement, with a 2sigma border. The described method allows fast and objective evaluation of AF images, preventing undesirable inter-expert variance. A large proportion of AF images could be evaluated successfully by the developed procedure, and the obtained results are comparable to the manual procedure in most cases."

Retinal imaging was performed using spectral-domain Cirrus HD-OCT in 20 NS patients (40 eyes) and 24 age-matched healthy controls (48 eyes). Study participants also underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and detailed neurological and ophthalmological evaluation. Quantitative OCT abnormalities of average macular thickness (AMT), peri-papillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, or both, were detectable in 60% of NS patients. Of NS patients with ocular symptomatology, 75% demonstrated quantitative OCT abnormalities, while only 25% had detectable abnormalities on detailed ophthalmological assessment. Furthermore, 33% of NS patients without ocular symptoms had quantitative OCT changes, while only 8% had abnormal ophthalmologic examination. RNFL and macular thinning and swelling were significant in the NS cohort compared to healthy controls (variance ratio testing; RNFL: p = 0.02, AMT: p = 0.006). AMT also correlated inversely with disease duration (r (s) = -0.65, p = 0.002). Patient proportions with OCT abnormalities did not differ according to NS subtype (myelopathic, meningeal, or encephalitic NS), CSF findings, or immunotherapy exposure. No qualitative OCT abnormalities were detected. Retinal abnormalities occur in all NS subtypes, and may be clinical or subclinical. Our findings suggest OCT may enable greater detection of retinal abnormalities in NS than ophthalmological assessment alone, and have implications for the assessment of ocular involvement in NS, and sarcoidosis in general. Longitudinal NS studies utilizing OCT are warranted."

Compared with previous instruments without customized corneal compensation, the variable corneal compensation technology enables improved differentiation between glaucoma and healthy eyes. Limitations are the atypical birefringence patterns that exist in some eyes, showing false high RNFL values. The newest software uses enhanced corneal compensation (ECC) technology to avoid these atypical patterns and to improve glaucoma diagnosis.

CD008803,0,20460204,0,Multimodal registration procedure for the initial spatial alignment of a retinal video sequence to a retinal composite image.,"Accurate placement of lesions is crucial for the effectiveness and safety of a retinal laser photocoagulation treatment. Computer assistance provides the capability for improvements to treatment accuracy and execution time. The idea is to use video frames acquired from a scanning digital ophthalmoscope (SDO) to compensate for retinal motion during laser treatment. This paper presents a method for the multimodal registration of the initial frame from an SDO retinal video sequence to a retinal composite image, which may contain a treatment plan. The retinal registration procedure comprises the following steps: 1) detection of vessel centerline points and identification of the optic disc; 2) prealignment of the video frame and the composite image based on optic disc parameters; and 3) iterative matching of the detected vessel centerline points in expanding matching regions. This registration algorithm was designed for the initialization of a real-time registration procedure that registers the subsequent video frames to the composite image. The algorithm demonstrated its capability to register various pairs of SDO video frames and composite images acquired from patients."

CD008803,0,6471607,0,Acute anterior and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy.,"Criteria for diagnosis of acute ischemic optic neuropathy (acute ION) were proposed: acute ION was divided into two groups, ie, acute anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (acute AION) and acute posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (acute PION). Acute AION is characterized by pale or sometimes hyperemic papilledema in the early stage, followed by postneuritic optic atrophy. In contrast, acute PION shows normal optic disk in the early stage followed by development of simple optic atrophy. We analyzed 31 eyes of 24 cases with acute AION and 20 eyes of 18 cases with acute PION. The diagnostic criteria and clinical findings in both types were compared. Through analyses of the etiological factors, acute PION was thought to be acute retrobulbar optic neuritis caused by ischemic changes in the optic nerve. Laboratory examinations of serum lipids, hemostatic and fibrinolytic activities in cases of acute ION did not reveal significant differences from the findings in cases with retinal vein occlusion and diabetic retinopathy. In the early stage of acute ION, steroid therapy gave rise to some improvement of the visual function but showed no effect in the late stage of the disease."

CD008803,0,10180519,0,Measurement of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in clinical routine.,"The possibilities and limitations of methods for indirect and direct nerve fiber layer thickness (NFLT) measurements, and a summary of our own clinical studies using Optic Nerve Head Analyzer (Rodenstock, Munich, Germany) (ONHA), Laser Tomographic Scanner (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) (LTS), Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) (HRT), Nerve Fiber Analyzer (Laser Diagnostic Technologies, San Diego, CA) (NFA) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), together with the literature of the review period, are highlighted. A retinal hemifield test with the new parameters, retinal asymmetry difference and retinal asymmetry index, is introduced. These relative nerve fiber layer thickness (NFLT) measurement values are found to be independent of age, reference plane, and disc size. This reduces the interindividual variation of the measurements and may improve screening possibilities for glaucoma. The detection probability for nerve fiber bundle defects was found to be stage-dependent using HRT and NFA. For laser polarimetry, a decreasing correlation between NFLT and visual field loss with advanced glaucomatous disease was found. In the lower retina, a 6.9% higher NFLT was evident compared with the upper peripapillary NFLT in healthy eyes using NFA and OCT. This is not in correlation with perimetric retinal sensitivity, which was found to be 3.9% higher in the lower hemifield compared with the upper hemifield. In general, quantitative NFLT measures (HRT, NFA, OCT) were correlated with visual field loss in glaucoma. The interindividual variability of NFLT measurements, among other things, induces limitations on distinguishing beginning glaucoma from normals. Clinical and scientific significance and future directions of NFLT measurements are discussed."

CD008803,0,22006982,0,Optical coherence tomography segmentation reveals ganglion cell layer pathology after optic neuritis.,"Post-mortem ganglion cell dropout has been observed in multiple sclerosis; however, longitudinal in vivo assessment of retinal neuronal layers following acute optic neuritis remains largely unexplored. Peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness, measured by optical coherence tomography, has been proposed as an outcome measure in studies of neuroprotective agents in multiple sclerosis, yet potential swelling during the acute stages of optic neuritis may confound baseline measurements. The objective of this study was to ascertain whether patients with multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica develop retinal neuronal layer pathology following acute optic neuritis, and to systematically characterize such changes in vivo over time. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography imaging, including automated retinal layer segmentation, was performed serially in 20 participants during the acute phase of optic neuritis, and again 3 and 6 months later. Imaging was performed cross-sectionally in 98 multiple sclerosis participants, 22 neuromyelitis optica participants and 72 healthy controls. Neuronal thinning was observed in the ganglion cell layer of eyes affected by acute optic neuritis 3 and 6 months after onset (P < 0.001). Baseline ganglion cell layer thicknesses did not demonstrate swelling when compared with contralateral unaffected eyes, whereas peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer oedema was observed in affected eyes (P = 0.008) and subsequently thinned over the course of this study. Ganglion cell layer thickness was lower in both participants with multiple sclerosis and participants with neuromyelitis optica, with and without a history of optic neuritis, when compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001) and correlated with visual function. Of all patient groups investigated, those with neuromyelitis optica and a history of optic neuritis exhibited the greatest reduction in ganglion cell layer thickness. Results from our in vivo longitudinal study demonstrate retinal neuronal layer thinning following acute optic neuritis, corroborating the hypothesis that axonal injury may cause neuronal pathology in multiple sclerosis. Further, these data provide evidence of subclinical disease activity, in both participants with multiple sclerosis and with neuromyelitis optica without a history of optic neuritis, a disease in which subclinical disease activity has not been widely appreciated. No pathology was seen in the inner or outer nuclear layers of eyes with optic neuritis, suggesting that retrograde degeneration after optic neuritis may not extend into the deeper retinal layers. The subsequent thinning of the ganglion cell layer following acute optic neuritis, in the absence of evidence of baseline swelling, suggests the potential utility of quantitative optical coherence tomography retinal layer segmentation to monitor neuroprotective effects of novel agents in therapeutic trials."

This noninvasive optical technology has its roots in the application of optics to reflected light imaging of the eye. These instrument developments began with Leeuwenhoek's use of his single lens microscope to investigate the structure of the eye. There followed a series of connected instruments: the ophthalmoscope, the slit lamp, the specular microscope, and the clinical confocal microscope. In vivo confocal microscopy produces high contrast, reflected light images or optical sections through the depth of living ocular tissue. Stacks of registered optical sections can be transformed by computer visualization techniques into three-dimensional volume images of ocular tissues: cornea, ocular lens, retina, and optic nerve. The clinical confocal microscope has resulted in new diagnostic techniques and new cellular descriptions of ocular disorders and pathology."
CD008803,0,23733123,0,In vivo evaluation of lamina cribrosa deformation in glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies that have in common a slow progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and their axons, resulting in a distinct appearance of the optic disc and a concomitant pattern of visual loss. The lamina cribrosa (LC) is a mesh-like structure at the optic nerve head, through which the RGC axons and retinal blood vessels pass. Glaucomatous neuronal death occurs in the retina, optic nerve, lateral geniculate nucleus and visual cortex, but the optic nerve head-especially the LC- is considered to be the primary site of axonal injury. Evaluation of the LC structure may greatly enhance glaucoma diagnostics and our understanding of its pathophysiology. However, only a small portion of the LC is clinically seen through the thin prelaminar neural tissue in the central area of the optic disc. The LC is mostly obscured by the neuroretinal rim in the optic disc region, and by the sclera, choroid, retinal pigment epithelium in the parapapillary region. With enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography, different mechanisms of laminar deformation in glaucoma can be demonstrated, and a new structure-structure-function correlation developed."

CD008803,0,10420104,0,Asymmetry in intraocular pressure and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in normal-tension glaucoma.,"The etiology of glaucoma is most probably multifactorial. This study intended to investigate the asymmetry in intraocular pressure (IOP) and that in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in normal-tension glaucoma patients. Two diurnal tension curves, obtained within 3 months and counting at least five IOP readings each, including an early morning IOP measurement upon awaking, were obtained in 15 normal-tension glaucoma patients. None of the patients received IOP-lowering therapy. IOP asymmetry was present in at least three readings and was always in the same direction. The optic nerve was imaged in both eyes in each patient by means of confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph). The interocular difference in RNFL thickness and the RNFL cross-sectional area were correlated with the interocular difference in IOP by means of Spearman's rank correlation factor. Nine female and 6 male normal-tension glaucoma patients (mean +/- SD age was 62. 4 +/- 16.9 years) were included in this study. Interocular IOP asymmetry varied between 0.30 and 4 mm Hg. Strong negative correlations were found between interocular asymmetry in IOP and interocular asymmetry in RNFL thickness asymmetry (R = -0.652, p = 0. 0083) and interocular asymmetry in RNFL cross-sectional area (R = -0. 702, p = 0.0034).

In this study, OCT-3 was used by three trained and experienced operators to measure peripapillary RNFL and macular retinal thickness in a randomly chosen single eye from each normal subject. Mean thickness levels and the differences in thickness measurements among the three operators were calculated and compared. The eyes of 39 subjects (24 females and 15 males) were enrolled. The mean age of the subjects was 30.4 +/- 16.1 years (range, 11-46 years). The mean pupil diameter after pupillary dilation was 7.4 +/- 0.6mm (range, 6-9 mm). Comparing peripapillary RNFL and macular retinal thickness measurements after pupillary dilation, there were no significant differences in: superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal peripapillary areas; 6 mm total macular volume and foveal thickness; and 1, 3 and 6 mm perifoveal areas among the three operators.

CD008803,0,22300877,0,The time course of retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration following occipital lobe damage in humans.,"Following damage to the human post-geniculate visual pathway retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration of the optic nerve fibres occurs. It has been known for some time from investigations carried out in primates that a decline in the number of retinal ganglion cells follows occipital lobectomy. However, this is not detectable in all species studied and whether this occurs in humans was controversial until recent studies that have shown that following lesions of the occipital lobe, the retinal nerve fibre layer thickness measured by optical coherence tomography is reduced and corresponding shrinkage of the optic tract can be demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. The time course of the degeneration in humans is, however, unknown. In the present study, we have used optical coherence tomography to demonstrate for the first time progressive thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer following occipital lobe/optic radiation damage due to stroke. First, in a group of 38 patients the measurement was taken on a single occasion at a known time interval since the stroke, ranging from 6 days to 67 years. Here, a negative straight line relationship (linear regression r = 0.54, P < 0.001) was found between nerve fibre layer thickness and elapsed time since injury in log years, giving a rate of decline of 9.08 µm per log year after adjusting for age. This indicates a decelerating rate of loss that differs from the rate of decline found with chronological age in this same group, which shows a steady rate of thinning by 0.4 µm per year (P = 0.006) after adjusting for duration of the disease. In a second study serial measurements were taken following the acute event in a group of seven patients with homonymous hemianopia; here a negative straight line relationship was found between time and nerve fibre layer thickness in micrometres over a period of data collection beginning at a mean of 36.9 days post-stroke (range 5-112) and ending at a mean of 426.6 days post-stroke (range 170-917). Evidence from clinical observation (funduscopy) suggested that retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration occurred in humans only where the damage to the post-geniculate pathway occurred prenatally. The results reported herein add weight to the previous demonstration that this type of degeneration does indeed occur in the human visual system by showing that it can be monitored over time and hence may provide a model for trans-synaptic degeneration in the human central nervous system."

Only eyes in which the NFLD reached the temporal raphe in either hemisphere were used. We defined three topographic parameters of NFLD: 1) the angle (theta, degrees) of line 'A' from the optic disc center to the foveal pit, and line 'B' from the disc center to a point of the NFLD at the disc edge nearest line 'A'; 2) a horizontal distance (D1, mm) along the temporal raphe between the foveal pit and the internal edge of the NFLD; and 3) a vertical distance (D2, mm) between the foveal pit and either the superior or inferior internal edge of the NFLD. We defined the nearest defect location (in degrees from the fovea) as the nearest location with sensitivity loss of at least 6 dB (Humphrey visual field program 10-2).

In a non-population-based pre-publicised trial, self-recruited Caucasian participants were screened for glaucoma and NA-AION using the RTVue-100 OCT, and also by independent clinical examination. For the RTVue-100 OCT measurements, the optic nerve head (ONH) scan and the macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) scan were applied. Subjects with possible optic neuropathy (as indicated by any of the scans and/or by the clinical examination) underwent a detailed clinical investigation to verify or exclude the disease. Of the 146 attendees, 133 participants (256 eyes) successfully underwent the RTVue-100 OCT measurements. Of these, six eyes (2.3%) had glaucoma and three eyes (1.2%) had partial optic atrophy due to earlier NA-AION. The retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) parameters (provided by the instrument software) had 99.2-99.6% specificity, 96.5-96.9% accuracy, and positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 27.3-54.7, but only 11.1-22.2% sensitivity. Accuracy and PLR for the ONH parameters were <95% and <8.3, respectively. The GCC scan of the macula provided up to 95.9% specificity, 94.0% accuracy, 10.7 PLR and 44.4% sensitivity. During the screening of this Caucasian population with 3.5% prevalence of optic neuropathy due to glaucoma and NA-AION, the RTVue-100 OCT was found to be useful for screening, with both RNFL and GCC parameters providing high accuracy and PLR values >10."

Such changes in polarization may be a sensitive indicator of tissue structure and function, and as such have gained increased clinical attention. Here we demonstrate a polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) system that incorporates adaptive optics (AO) in the sample arm and a single line scan camera in the detection arm. We quantify the benefit of AO for PS-OCT in terms of signal-to-noise, lateral resolution, and speckle size. Double pass phase retardation per unit depth values ranging from 0.25 degrees/microm to 0.65 degrees/microm were found in the birefringent nerve fiber layer at 6 degrees eccentricity, superior to the fovea, with the highest values being noticeably higher than previously reported with PS-OCT around the optic nerve head. Moreover, fast axis orientation and degree of polarization uniformity measurements made with AO-PS-OCT demonstrate polarization scrambling in the retinal pigment epithelium at the highest resolution reported to date."

CD008803,0,24390374,0,Degradation in the degree of polarization in human retinal nerve fiber layer.,"Using a fiber-based swept-source (SS) polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) system, we investigate the degree of polarization (DOP) of light backscattered from the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in normal human subjects. Algorithms for processing data were developed to analyze the deviation in phase retardation and intensity of backscattered light in directions parallel and perpendicular to the nerve fiber axis (fast and slow axes of RNFL). Considering superior, inferior, and nasal quadrants, we observe the strongest degradation in the DOP with increasing RNFL depth in the temporal quadrant. Retinal ganglion cell axons in normal human subjects are known to have the smallest diameter in the temporal quadrant, and the greater degradation observed in the DOP suggests that higher polarimetric noise may be associated with neural structure in the temporal RNFL. The association between depth degradation in the DOP and RNFL structural properties may broaden the utility of PS-OCT as a functional imaging technique."

The RNFL was most visible in the temporal inferior sector, with the neuroretinal rim being correspondingly broadest (P < 0.001) and the diameter of the corresponding retinal artery the widest; these parameters were found to diminish appreciably in the temporal superior sector, the nasal superior sector, and the nasal inferior sector in this order. The visibility of the RNFL in a particular region therefore correlates positively with the rim width and retinal artery caliber in that region, the RNFL being most detectable in the temporal inferior part of the fundus. This may be important in the evaluation of eyes with optic nerve damage."

In this paper, a method is presented to model the change in images acquired by scanning laser polarimetry, for the detection of glaucomatous progression. The model is based on image series of 23 healthy eyes and incorporates colored noise, incomplete cornea compensation and masking by the retinal blood vessels. Additionally, two methods for detecting progression, taking either one or two follow-up visits into account, are discussed and tested on these simulated images. Both methods are based on Student's t-tests, morphological operations and anisotropic filtering. The images simulated by the model are visually pleasing, show corresponding statistical properties to the real images and are used to optimize the detection methods. The results show that detecting progression based on two follow-up visits greatly improves the sensitivity without adversely affecting the specificity."
CD008803,0,24018312,0,Macular spectral domain optical coherence tomography findings in Tanzanian endemic optic neuropathy.,"Bilateral optic neuropathy in Dar es Salaam is now considered endemic and is estimated to affect 0.3-2.4% of young adults. The condition is characterized by a subacute bilateral loss of central vision of unknown aetiology. Findings of spectral domain optical coherence tomography have not previously been reported for these patients. All patients diagnosed with endemic optic neuropathy over a 2-year period at the Muhimbili National Hospital underwent spectral domain optical coherence tomography macular imaging. Scans were graded qualitatively for severity of retinal nerve fibre layer loss as well as the presence of microcystic macular changes, which have not previously been described in this condition. Of the 128 patients included (54.7% male; median age 20 years), severe retinal nerve fibre layer loss was found in 185 eyes (74.0%). There was full concordance in retinal nerve fibre layer thickness between the two eyes in 113 (91.1%) patients. Microcystic macular spaces were found in 16 (12.5%) patients and were bilateral in nine (7.0%) individuals. These changes were typically more prominent in the nasal than the temporal macula, predominantly involving the inner nuclear layer, and often occurred in an annular configuration that was evident on en face infra-red imaging, though not discernible on colour fundus photography or clinically. All patients with microcystic macular changes had severe thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer (P = 0.02). Four patients in whom cystic spaces were demonstrated had sequential scans, and there was no detectable alteration in the configuration of these changes over a period of up to 16 months. This is the first study to document optical coherence tomography findings in endemic optic neuropathy. We have observed symmetrical severe loss of the caeco-central projection (papillomacular bundle) with otherwise well-preserved macular architecture. Also, we have observed microcystic retinal changes in a significant proportion of patients, which were associated with severe retinal nerve fibre layer loss. Similar changes have recently been reported from optical coherence tomography images of patients with multiple sclerosis, relapsing isolated optic neuritis, dominant optic atrophy, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and a patient with a chronic compressive optic neuropathy, supporting the hypothesis that this may be a non-specific phenomenon secondary to ganglion cell death. The correspondence of the changes to an annulus discernible on infra-red en face imaging, but not using other conventional retinal imaging techniques highlights the potential usefulness of this modality."

CD008803,0,23722446,0,An accurate multimodal 3-D vessel segmentation method based on brightness variations on OCT layers and curvelet domain fundus image analysis.,"This paper proposes a multimodal approach for vessel segmentation of macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) slices along with the fundus image. The method is comprised of two separate stages; the first step is 2-D segmentation of blood vessels in curvelet domain, enhanced by taking advantage of vessel information in crossing OCT slices (named feedback procedure), and improved by suppressing the false positives around the optic nerve head. The proposed method for vessel localization of OCT slices is also enhanced utilizing the fact that retinal nerve fiber layer becomes thicker in the presence of the blood vessels. The second stage of this method is axial localization of the vessels in OCT slices and 3-D reconstruction of the blood vessels. Twenty-four macular spectral 3-D OCT scans of 16 normal subjects were acquired using a Heidelberg HRA OCT scanner. Each dataset consisted of a scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) image and limited number of OCT scans with size of 496 × 512 (namely, for a data with 19 selected OCT slices, the whole data size was 496 × 512 × 19). The method is developed with least complicated algorithms and the results show considerable improvement in accuracy of vessel segmentation over similar methods to produce a local accuracy of 0.9632 in area of SLO, covered with OCT slices, and the overall accuracy of 0.9467 in the whole SLO image. The results are also demonstrative of a direct relation between the overall accuracy and percentage of SLO coverage by OCT slices."

The algorithm first pre-segments the NCO using a graph-theoretic approach. Oriented Gabor wavelets rotated around the center of the NCO are applied to extract features in a 2-D vessel-aimed projection image. Corresponding oriented NCO-based templates are utilized to help suppress the false positive tendency near the NCO boundary. The vessels are identified in a vessel-aimed projection image using a pixel classification algorithm. Based on the 2-D vessel profiles, 3-D vessel segmentation is performed by a triangular-mesh-based graph search approach in the SD-OCT volume. The segmentation method is trained on 5 and is tested on 10 randomly chosen independent ONH-centered SD-OCT volumes from 15 subjects with glaucoma. Using ROC analysis, for the 2-D vessel segmentation, we demonstrate an improvement over the closest previous work with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 (0.72 for previously reported approach) for the region around the NCO and 0.84 for the region outside the NCO (0.81 for previously reported approach)."

Patients diagnosed with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) had a comprehensive work-up including complete ophthalmic examination, fluorangiography (FA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), visual field testing (VFT), microperimetry (MP), and laser flare photometry (LFP). In case of BRVO, intraocular bevacizumab injection was performed if significant macular edema/visual deficit was still present 3 months after onset of occlusion and injections were started at presentation in case of CRVO. Post-injection follow-up examination including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), LFP, OCT, MP, and VFT were performed monthly and recorded at the end of follow-up. Follow-up FA was performed between 12 and 18 months after diagnosis. Injections were repeated in case of recurrence of a significant central macular edema. Patients were subdivided into 2 groups according to number of injections: 1-4 injections or more than 4 injections. The proportion of resolved cases (no recurrence after a minimum follow-up of 12 months) was calculated and correlated with number of injections. In patients needing sustained injections, management modalities were recorded. The proportion of patients having needed laser photocoagulation treatment because of significant ischemic signs was recorded. Fifty-one patients were diagnosed with retinal vein occlusion between 2006 and 2012 at the Centre for Specialized Ophthalmic Care (COS) in Lausanne, Switzerland. Forty-four had enough data and were included in the study. Nine eyes were affected by CRVO and 35 were affected by BRVO. Mean BCVA at presentation was 0.24 ± 0.2 and improved to 0.81 ± 0.38 (p < 0.01) at 48 months. MP improved from 184.9 ± 92 to 362.5 ± 56.2 (p < 0.01) at 42 months follow-up. The number of injections varied from 1 to 25 (mean 5.5 ± 5.43). 31/44 eyes received 1-4 injections (group 1) of which all were recurrence free, with a follow-up of at least 1 years in all. 13/44 eyes received more than 5 injections (group 2) with functional and morphological parameters maintained in 9/13 but only 1/13 patients showed resolution. Rhythm of injection varied from one patient to another but 8/13 patients needing continuous injections had a constant time interval between injections. In 8/44 patients, laser photocoagulation had to be performed due to ischemic complications. The visual outcome using bevacizumab intravitreal injection was exceptionally good and functional parameters such as BCVA, MP, and VFT improved significantly. In about two-thirds of patients, resolution was obtained after 1-4 injections. In one-third of patients, continuous injections were necessary but a constant rhythm for re-injection for each patient could be established allowing to reduce to a minimum follow-up visits. The absence of significant side effects allowed to re-treat apparently without limitation achieving maintained visual function. FA monitoring for the detection of ischemic complications should not be neglected especially in cases where bevacizumab could be discontinued."

CD008803,0,23631254,0,[New insights into the study of optic nerve diseases].,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides a new dimenstion in ophthalmology because it allows evaluation of the pathology in vivo, and provides information to assist the management of macular disease and glaucoma. It is necessary to differentiate the diagnosis of glaucoma from diseases of the optic nerve and of the visual pathway. This study evaluates the usefulness of OCT in detecting disorders of the optic nerve and visual pathway. In addition, the pathogenesis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON), the most common optic neuropathy, was investigated by focusing on the dynamics of aquaporin. I. Evaluation of optic nerve and visual pathway disorders by optical coherence tomography. The swinging flashlight test is an easy, sensitive, objective test to detect relative afferent pupillary defects (RAPD). The number of RAPD detected by the swinging flashlight test was closely correlated with the ratio of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) between the two eyes of 20 cases of unilateral optic atrophy. OCT could assess the amount of RAPD that reflected an asymmetrical functional disturbance of the optic nerves, as a structural difference. The time courses of RNFLT and ganglion cell complex (GCC) changes' were observed immediately following the time of injury in 4 cases of traumatic optic neuropathy. OCT revealed that both the RNFLT and GCC decreased rapidly from 2 weeks after the injury until 20 weeks later. The RNFLT decreased significantly in the horizontal direction in comparison to the perpendicular direction in 34 eyes from the cases of optic chiasm syndrome. This means that OCT could quantitatively detect the band atrophy of the optic disc in optic chiasm syndrome. Measuring the RNFLT showed a thinning of RNFLT in the perpendicular direction in comparison to the horizontal direction in ipsilateral eyes and thinning in the horizontal direction in comparison to the perpendicular direction in the contralateral eyes in optic tract syndrome. Measuring the GCC showed a thinning of the GCC in the temporal hemifield to the central fovea of the ipsilateral eyes, and thinning of the GCC in the nasal hemifield of the contralateral eyes. This means that OCT could detect the structural changes of hourglass atrophy in the ipsilateral eye and band atrophy in the contralateral eye at the optic disc as well as the homonymous hemianopia in the visual field. OCT was useful in evaluating the optic nerve and visual pathway disorders, but there were also some limitations. The thinning area of RNFLT measured by OPTVue and Cirrus were in entirely opposite directions in cases of optic chasm syndrome. The reason was attributed to the better performance of RTVue in measuring a thin RNFLT on the nasal side of the optic disc in comparison to Cirrus. The specific characteristics of the instruments should be considered when the results of OCT are evaluated. II. Dynamics of aquaporin in the optic nerve Aquaporin (AQP) is a membrane protein that forms a water channel to facilitate water crossing the plasma membrane. AQP-4 was originally thought to be expressed in the optic nerve, but it is expressed only in the retrobulbar medullated region of the optic nerve and the expression of AQPs in the optic disc has not been detected. This study investigated the expressions of AQPs in the optic nerve in rat, monkey and human. The results demonstrate that only AQP-9 was expressed at the unmedullated pre-lamina cribrosa and lamina cribrosa regions, and both AQP-4 and AQP-9 were expressed at the medullated retrobulbar region. Astrocytes were observed to express AQP-9, because AQP-9 immunoreactivity was identical to that of glial fibrillary acidic protein. Elevated intraocular pressure substantially reduced AQP-9 expression in the optic nerve, whereas expression of AQP-4 was not changed in rat eyes. The same phenomena were also observed in the monkey eye with ocular hypertension as well as human eye with glaucoma. AQP-9 is an aquaglyceroporin that allows solutes such as lactate rather than water to cross the cell membrane. The astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis has been proposed, in which lactate transported from astrocytes is used by neurons as an energy substrate. Reduction of AQP-9 expression in the optic nerve head under elevated intraocular pressures might be closely related to the pathogenesis of GON."

Sixty-six eyes of thirty-three patients suffering from MS were chosen. Thirty-five eyes had a previous history of optic neuritis (ON group) and thirty-one eyes had no previous history of optic neuritis (non-ON group). The FDTP was performed with the N-30 screening program. Visual acuity was determined with the Snellen scale and the ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) scale, the contrast vision with the Pelli-Robson and Sloan tests and the SAP with the Humphrey 750 perimeter. The thickness of the RNFL was measured using the STRATUS OCT™ optical coherence tomography (OCT). The visual field FDTP was divided into three sectors corresponding to the three SAP sectors and to the three RNFL quadrants of the OCT. The FDTP was significantly correlated (P<0.0001) to the contrast vision and to the SAP results (mean deviation (MD) and the different sectors among themselves). In the ON group, the MD FDTP was significantly correlated to the average RNFL thickness (r=0.44, P=0.0091). A decrease of 5 decibels (dB) of the MD FDTP corresponded to a decrease of 11.7 μm of the average RNFL thickness (Y=2.34×X+87.5). The strong correlation with SAP and RNFL confirms the value of FDTP in assessing optic nerve damage throughout the course of MS."

All optic nerve head parameters except HVC correlated significantly with the visual field indices; the highest correlation was between rim area and mean deviation (r = 0.6172, p < 0.00001). The rim area of the superior and inferior quadrants correlated significantly with the visual field defects in corresponding sectors.

CD008803,0,19224900,0,Retrograde trans-synaptic retinal ganglion cell loss identified by optical coherence tomography.,"There is experimental evidence of trans-synaptic retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells following retrogeniculate visual pathway lesions in primate studies. Retinal nerve fibre loss in congenital homonymous hemianopia in humans is well recognized from clinical observation but the findings in acquired lesions have been controversial. Forty-eight persons were recruited and divided into three groups. Two groups were patients with retrogeniculate lesions. In the first group, the occipital damage had occurred during childhood or in adult life whilst the lesions in the second group were congenital. Inclusion criteria for the retrogeniculate lesions included: age >18 years at time of testing; homonymous hemianopia; no other ophthalmic or neurological disorder; and neuroimaging demonstration of occipital lobe damage. The third group had normal visual function. Measurement of the thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer by optical coherence tomography has been carried out in both eyes of each subject. The primary outcome is the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNT) in microns. The mean RNT in the eyes with temporal hemianopia (here called the 'crossing-fibre defect' eyes) is 79.8 mu (SD = 35.1 mu) in the acquired and 72.7 mu (SD = 33.2 mu) in the congenital. The mean RNT in eyes with nasal hemianopia (here called the 'non-crossing-fibre defect' eyes) is 83 mu (SD = 29.5 mu) in the acquired and 73.4 mu (SD = 26 mu) in the congenital. In the control group, the RNT measured 101.4 mu (SD = 36.6 mu) for the left eyes and 100.8 mu (SD = 35.4 mu) for the right eyes. In both crossing-fibre defect eyes and non-crossing-fibre defect eyes the mean RNT is significantly greater in the controls than in the hemianopia groups (P < 0.001). These data confirm that there is thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer following both congenital and acquired lesions of the retrogeniculate visual pathway in humans. This is most likely to represent retinal ganglion cell loss in both congential and acquired groups. Furthermore the magnitude of the thinning is similar in both groups despite the fact that clinical observation has consistently found evidence of RNT thinning in cases of congenital but not in cases of acquired pathology. The data have also been analysed in 12 sectors around the optic disc: it has been shown that the RNT thinning follows the known trajectories of the crossing and non-crossing retinal ganglion cell axons approaching the disc."

Visuospatial difficulties are more prominent in those whose motor symptoms begin on the left body side (LPD) than the right body side (RPD) and have mainly been attributed to parietal dysfunction. The source of visuospatial dysfunction is unclear, as in addition to subcortical-cortical changes, there are irregularities of visual scanning and potentially of retinal-level vision in PD. To assess these potential contributors, performance on a visuospatial task--line bisection--was examined together with retinal structure (nerve fiber layer thickness, measured by optical coherence tomography [OCT]), retinal function (contrast sensitivity, measured by frequency-doubling technology [FDT]), and visual scanning patterns. Participants included 20 nondemented patients (10 LPD, 10 RPD) and 11 normal control (NC) adults. Relative to the other groups, LPD were expected to show rightward bias on horizontal line bisection, especially within the left visual hemispace, and downward bias on vertical bisection. LPD relative rightward bias was confirmed, though not mainly within the left hemispace and not correlated with retinal structure or function. Retinal thinning was seen in LPD relative to RPD. Qualitative visualization of eye movements suggested greater LPD exploration of the right than left side of the line during horizontal bisection, and some overall compression of scanning range in RPD (both orientations) and LPD (primarily vertical). Results indicated that rightward visuospatial bias in our LPD sample arose not from abnormalities at the retinal level but potentially from attentional biases, reflected in eye movement patterns."

CD008803,0,8963150,0,[Sleep modifies anticholinergic mydriasis].,"In sleep, the eyelids are closed and the pupils narrow. The pupil width indicates alertness and, if it is narrow, sleepiness. The deeper the sleep, the narrower the pupil: miosis during drowsiness, sleep, sedation and general anesthesia relies on reduced inhibition of the oculomotor nucleus and, even more, on reduced sympathetic tone (it is as sympatholysis that accounts for the miosis exerted by the famous ""cocktail lytique"" onto an iris whose sphincter is weakened from briskly elevated IOP in angle-closure glaucoma). For whatever reason a lack of sympathetic tone occurs, a poor response to anticholinergic mydriatics will be the consequence. This communication is concerned with children who received tropicamide, cyclopentolate or atropine for diagnostic pupil dilation and cycloplegia but, during subsequent sleep, exhibited an unsatisfactory mydriatic response that could be overcome by additional administration of phenylephrine. Thus, parasympatholytic mydriasis can be proven to be a function of the sympathetic tone. The pupil shrinks during deep sleep even after atropine. If the conditions of deep sleep, sedation or general anesthesia are present and mydriasis needs to be maintained, an additional administration of a sympathomimetic compound is mandatory."

The current software in the VisanteTM OCT system by Zeiss is based on manual labeling of the scleral spur, cornea and iris and is a tedious process for ophthalmologists. Furthermore, the scleral spur can not be identified in about 20% to 30% of OCT images and thus measurements of the ACA are not reliable. However, high definition (HD) OCT has identified a more consistent landmark: Schwalbe's line. This paper presents a novel algorithm which automatically detects Schwalbe's line in HD-OCT scans. The average deviation between the values detected using our algorithm and those labeled by the ophthalmologist is less than 0.5% and 0.35% in the horizontal and vertical image dimension, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a new measurement to quantify ACA which is defined as Schwalbe's line bounded area (SLBA)."

Conversely, the eye with worse MD than the contralateral eye had a watershed zone which included a larger part of the optic disc than the other eye (p < 0.05). The location of watershed zone appeared to influence the progression of the visual field defect."

We use a prototype scanning laser ophthalmoscope capable of simultaneous multiple wavelength imaging to record fundus images. The advantages of simultaneous acquisition compared to serial acquisition are, reduced image capture times, and image registration is not required. The system is run under non-confocal conditions in using slit apertures with a width of up to 600 microm. The laser lines launched into the SLO were the 633 nm line of a HeNe- laser, and the 815 nm line from a tunable (740 nm to 840 nm) cw Ti:Sapphire-laser. The difference in absorption at these two wavelengths is used to produce a differential image. We compare conventional imaging with differential spectral imaging for viewing the choroidal vessels. Qualitative results show the contrast of choroidal vessels in differential imaging is improved compared with normal imaging in the region of the optic disk and for the level of pigmentation in the subjects examined."

This prospective study included newly diagnosed nodulocystic acne patients about to receive isotretinoin treatment. Macular average GCL thickness and peripapillary average, temporal, nasal, inferior, and superior quadrant RNFL thickness were measured by OCT before and after isotretinoin treatment. Pre- and post-treatment measurements were compared with paired t test. Fifty-six eyes of 28 patients were included. The mean duration of the treatment was 6.5 ± 1.3 months. The mean average GCL thickness was 90.04 ± 5.87 (80-96) μm at baseline and 90.75 ± 6.34 (81-96) μm after treatment. The mean average RNFL thickness was 93.25 ± 6.06 μm (84-107) before treatment and 93.05 ± 5.54 μm (82-106) after treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between pre- and post-treatment values (all p > 0.05).

Three-dimensional datasets centered on the lamina cribrosa were obtained with 200 X 200 to 512 X 512 A-scan densities. The effect of scan density and c-mode slab thickness was subjectively compared. Increasing slab thickness reduced the sharpness of visible prelamina and lamina cribrosa structures. In retrolamina structures, thin slabs provided good visualization, but increased slab size increased the visibility of deeper structures. Scan times as short as 2.3 seconds (256 X 256 A-scans) degraded visualization of the shape of the optic nerve head.

This newly developed eAS-OCT operating at 1340-nm wavelength band is simultaneously capable of an imaging speed of 120 kHz A-line scan rate, an axial resolution of 7.2 μm, and an extended imaging range of up to 16 mm in air. Imaging results from three healthy subjects and one subject with a narrow-angle demonstrate the instrument's utility. With this system, it can provide anatomical dimensions of AS, including central corneal thickness, anterior chamber width, anterior chamber depth, crystalline lens vault, crystalline lens thickness, angle opening distance (AOD500/AOD750), and the area described by the trabecular-iris space (TISA500/TISA750) at 500/750  μm. We also use eAS-OCT to image and quantify dynamic functional changes of the AS in response to a light stimulus that induces physiological pupillary changes as well as accommodative efforts that induce lens changes.

CD008803,0,19524027,0,High resolution three-dimensional reconstruction of the collagenous matrix of the human optic nerve head.,"Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness worldwide, leading to irreversible loss of vision. Prior studies indicate that ocular pressure-induced displacement of the lamina cribrosa (LC) may be responsible for retinal ganglion cell axon damage inside the neural canal. We present a novel approach to imaging the entire lamina cribrosa and the scleral canal at high lateral and axial resolution by using a combination of array tomography and nonlinear optical imaging of serial ultrathin orthogonal sections to detect second harmonic generated (SHG) signals from collagen. The resulting images can be analyzed individually or combined to form a three-dimensional reconstruction of the lamina. Due to the specificity of SHG generated from collagen the density and distribution of collagen inside the scleral canal can be objectively quantified with a high degree of accuracy. The reconstruction shows a non-uniform distribution of collagen along both the longitudinal and orthogonal axes. Mapping the collagen density by geographic region reveals significant differences in collagen content that result in ""thin spots"" with low collagen density as well as areas of very high collagen content. This suggests a non-uniform mechanical stiffness across the lamina that may account for increased axon damage observed in glaucoma patients. The inferior temporal region of the ONH in particular is marked by low collagen density, which corresponds with clinical observations identifying this region as being more susceptible to damage during the onset of glaucoma. Further application of this technique will help characterize the relationship of age, race and gender on the morphology of the LC."

CD008803,0,24906911,0,Thickness related textural properties of retinal nerve fiber layer in color fundus images.,"Images of ocular fundus are routinely utilized in ophthalmology. Since an examination using fundus camera is relatively fast and cheap procedure, it can be used as a proper diagnostic tool for screening of retinal diseases such as the glaucoma. One of the glaucoma symptoms is progressive atrophy of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) resulting in variations of the RNFL thickness. Here, we introduce a novel approach to capture these variations using computer-aided analysis of the RNFL textural appearance in standard and easily available color fundus images. The proposed method uses the features based on Gaussian Markov random fields and local binary patterns, together with various regression models for prediction of the RNFL thickness. The approach allows description of the changes in RNFL texture, directly reflecting variations in the RNFL thickness. Evaluation of the method is carried out on 16 normal (""healthy"") and 8 glaucomatous eyes. We achieved significant correlation (normals: ρ=0.72±0.14; p≪0.05, glaucomatous: ρ=0.58±0.10; p≪0.05) between values of the model predicted output and the RNFL thickness measured by optical coherence tomography, which is currently regarded as a standard glaucoma assessment device. The evaluation thus revealed good applicability of the proposed approach to measure possible RNFL thinning."
CD008803,0,11026973,0,Imaging the optic nerve and ganglion cell layer.,"New imaging techniques have extended the limitations of visualisation of the structures of the optic nerve and fundus in the living human eye. Quantitative reconstruction of depth of the optic nerve head is becoming widely available through the use of the confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO). A separate method of quantitative depth reconstruction is possible using stereo pairs which is not subject to the same artefacts as the tomographic reconstruction. We are investigating the use of these techniques both with conventional stereo imaging and using stereo pairs derived from cSLO images. In these we find that there is additional structural detail evident in the base of the optic nerve head. Further studies made with an instrument optimised to image this region show that this corresponds to the lamina cribrosa. Current work is aimed at further extending the limits of imaging using techniques based on optical coherence tomography, which provides additional depth resolution. Results to date with a prototype device show an improvement of approximately a factor of 10 in depth resolution and that some separate layers of the retina may be visualised including the photoreceptor layer. The goal is to extend these limits to allow visualisation of the ganglion cell layer."

CD008803,0,18929106,0,The role of OCT in glaucoma management.,"Clinical examination of the optic nerve and achromatic automated perimetry is the gold standard for the management of glaucoma. However, there is an increasing need for an objective evaluation of the optic nerve structure, particularly for preperimetric glaucoma. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive tool that measures retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness based on its optical properties. Computer image processing algorithms estimate NFL thickness from circumpapillary OCT images that are acquired in cylindrical sections surrounding the optic disc. Average values of NFL thickness can be calculated in the four quadrants or the 12 o'clock position sectors around the optic disc. The mean NFL thickness around the entire disc can also be calculated. NFL thickness values may be compared to a normative database. Although this technique offers objectivity, rapidity, and reproducibility, it is largely influenced by the variability of optic disc size and the number of nerve fibers among individuals. At present, OCT is a good instrument to diagnose early glaucoma, but cannot be used to exclude it. New technologies, like spectral domain and ultra-high resolution, which are already available, will overcome the limitations of OCT."

Either they were either examined or they participated in a validated telephone interview so we could determine their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores.Both RNFL thickness (Spearman r(s) = -0.47, p < 0.001) and EDSS scores ( r(s) = 0.51, p < 0.001) correlated with disease duration.

CD008803,0,22701702,0,Patterns of retinal damage facilitate differential diagnosis between Susac syndrome and MS.,"Susac syndrome, a rare but probably underdiagnosed combination of encephalopathy, hearing loss, and visual deficits due to branch retinal artery occlusion of unknown aetiology has to be considered as differential diagnosis in various conditions. Particularly, differentiation from multiple sclerosis is often challenging since both clinical presentation and diagnostic findings may overlap. Optical coherence tomography is a powerful and easy to perform diagnostic tool to analyse the morphological integrity of retinal structures and is increasingly established to depict characteristic patterns of retinal pathology in multiple sclerosis. Against this background we hypothesised that differential patterns of retinal pathology facilitate a reliable differentiation between Susac syndrome and multiple sclerosis. In this multicenter cross-sectional observational study optical coherence tomography was performed in nine patients with a definite diagnosis of Susac syndrome. Data were compared with age-, sex-, and disease duration-matched relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients with and without a history of optic neuritis, and with healthy controls. Using generalised estimating equation models, Susac patients showed a significant reduction in either or both retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and total macular volume in comparison to both healthy controls and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients. However, in contrast to the multiple sclerosis patients this reduction was not distributed over the entire scanning area but showed a distinct sectorial loss especially in the macular measurements. We therefore conclude that patients with Susac syndrome show distinct abnormalities in optical coherence tomography in comparison to multiple sclerosis patients. These findings recommend optical coherence tomography as a promising tool for differentiating Susac syndrome from MS."

Ocular microcirculation was examined by the contact method on a LAKK-01 Doppler laser flowmeter. The morphometric parameters were explored by scanning laser ophthalmoscopy on a NRT device. Analysis showed a significant linear correlation of the active and passive modulations of microcirculation with the thickness of a retinal nerve fiber layer, the area and volume of the neuroretinal rim, and the volume profile of excavation in both types of microcirculatory changes. On the bases of the derived ratios, it has been concluded that in patients with the hyperemic type of microcirculation, active modulation mechanisms (enhanced neurogenic and myogenic activities of afferent microvessels) are responsive for glaucomatous optic neuropath in the presence of elevated IOP. In patients with the spastic type, decreased neurogenic and myogenic activities of afferent microvessels are an independent mechanism of tissue damage in the head of the optic nerve in normalized IOP."

CD008803,0,24809827,0,Visual function assessment in simulated real-life situations in HIV-infected subjects.,"Visual function abnormalities are common in people living with HIV disease (PLWH) without retinitis, even after improvement in immune status. Abnormalities such as reduced contrast sensitivity, altered color vision, peripheral visual field loss, and electrophysiological changes are related to a combination of retinal dysfunctions, involving inner and outer retinal structures. The standard protocol for testing vision performance in clinical practice is the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. However, this method poorly correlates with activities of daily living that require patients to assess visual stimuli in multiple light/contrast conditions, and with limited time. We utilized a novel interactive computer program (Central Vision Analyzer) to analyze vision performance in PLWH under a variety of light/contrast conditions that simulate stressful and real-world environments. The program tests vision in a time-dependent way that we believe better correlates with daily living activities than the non-timed ETDRS chart. We also aimed to correlate visual scores with retinal neuro-fiber layer thickness on optical coherence tomography. Here we show that visual acuity is more affected in PLWH in comparison to HIV-seronegative controls in varying contrast and luminance, especially if the nadir CD4+ T-cell count was lower than 100 cells/mm3. Visual impairment reflects the loss of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness especially of the temporal-inferior sector. In PLWH the ETDRS chart test led to better visual acuity compared to the Central Vision Analyzer equivalent test, likely because patients had indefinite time to guess the letters. This study confirms and strengthens the finding that visual function is affected in PLWH even in absence of retinitis, since we found that the HIV serostatus is the best predictor of visual loss. The Central Vision Analyzer may be useful in the diagnosis of subclinical HIV-associated visual loss in multiple light/contrast conditions, and may offer better understanding of this entity called ""neuroretinal disorder""."

Patients with four specific optic disk appearances have been investigated, and differences have been identified in their demographic characteristics, prevalence of certain risk factors, the pattern of visual field damage, and circulatory abnormalities in their retrobulbar vessels. The findings provide evidence of the existence of subgroups of primary open-angle glaucoma with correlations between risk factor and type of optic disk.

Nevertheless, better, non-invasive methods to assess these characteristics in vivo are essential for a thorough understanding of degenerative mechanisms. Here, we propose to measure ocular tissue movements induced by cardiac pulsations and study the ocular pulse waveform as an indicator of tissue compliance. Using a novel, low-cost and non-invasive device based on spectral-domain low coherence interferometry (SD-LCI), we demonstrate the potential of this technique to differentiate ocular hemodynamic and biomechanical properties. We measured the axial movement of the retina driven by the pulsatile ocular blood flow in 11 young healthy individuals, 12 older healthy individuals and 15 older treated glaucoma patients using our custom-made SD-OCT apparatus. The cardiac pulse was simultaneously measured through the use of an oximeter to allow comparison. Spectral components up to the second harmonic were obtained and analyzed. For the different cohorts, we computed a few parameters that characterize the three groups of individuals by analyzing the movement of the retinal tissue at two locations, using this simple, low-cost interferometric device. Our pilot study indicates that spectral analysis of the fundus pulsation has potential for the study of ocular biomechanical and vascular properties, as well as for the study of ocular disease."

We examined 97 PD patients and 32 healthy controls (HC) with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), including intra-retinal layer segmentation. In total, we compared 111 retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)-scans and 114 macula scans from 68 PD patients with 62 RNFL and 63 macula scans from 32 HC. For clinical evaluation of disease severity, we used the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor examination. To determine color discrimination, we performed the Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue Test (FMT) in a subgroup of PD patients. We found significant combined outer nuclear and photoreceptor layer thinning in PD versus HC (118.6 vs. 123.5 µm, P = 0.001). Differences in RNFL, total macular volume, or the other retinal layer thicknesses were not detected. The OCT measures were not associated with disease severity, duration, or color vision. By showing photoreceptor cell layer thinning, our findings support previous in vivo and autopsy studies demonstrating retinal alterations in PD. Optical coherence tomography may help to assess morphological retinal changes in PD patients; however, the utility of OCT in routine clinical practice may be limited because many PD patients have difficulties complying with OCT investigation because of disease-related symptoms such as tremor, axial rigidity, or cognitive impairment."

CD008803,0,19772858,0,3D morphometry of the human optic nerve head.,"Human optic nerve head (ONH) anatomy is of interest in glaucoma. Our goal was to carry out a morphometric study of the human ONH based on 3D reconstructions from histologic sections. A set of 10 human ONHs (from four pairs of eyes plus two singles) were reconstructed in an iterative procedure that required the resulting geometries to satisfy a set of quality control criteria. Five models corresponded to eyes fixed at 5 mmHg and the other five models to eyes fixed at 50 mmHg. Several aspects of ONH morphology were measured based on surface and point landmarks: the thicknesses of the lamina cribrosa (LC), the peripapillary sclera and the pre-laminar neural tissue (peripapillary and within the cup); the minimum distance between the anterior surface of the LC and the subarachnoid space; the surface area of the anterior and posterior surfaces of the LC; and the diameter of the scleral canal opening. Our results showed that about one third of the anterior LC surface was obscured from view from the front by the sclera. In all eyes the LC inserted into the pia mater, and not only into the sclera. The variations in ONH morphology between eyes of a pair exceeded, or were of the same order as, changes in morphology due to acute changes in IOP. The reconstruction and morphometry techniques introduced are suitable for application to the ONH. Comparison of measurements in eyes fixed at different pressures suggested small effects on geometry of the increase in IOP. A large variability in ONH morphology, even between contralateral eyes of different IOP, was observed. We conclude that reconstruction of human ONH anatomy from 3D histology is possible, but that large inter-individual anatomic variations make morphometric analysis of the ONH very difficult in the absence of large sample numbers. The insertion of the pia mater into the LC may have biomechanical implications and should be further investigated. Emerging clinical imaging techniques such as deep-scanning OCT will be limited to investigation of the central and mid-peripheral regions of the LC due to optical ""occluding"" by the peripapillary sclera."

Such systems are becoming ever more essential to vision research and are expected to prove their clinical value for diagnosis of retinal diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and retinitis pigmentosa. The SSOCT channel operates at a wavelength of 1 microm for increased penetration and visualization of the choriocapillaris and choroid, sites of major disease activity for DR and wet AMD. This AO system is designed for use in clinical populations; a dual deformable mirror (DM) configuration allows simultaneous low- and high-order aberration correction over a large range of refractions and ocular media quality. The system also includes a wide field (33 deg.) line scanning ophthalmoscope (LSO) for initial screening, target identification, and global orientation, an integrated retinal tracker (RT) to stabilize the SLO, OCT, and LSO imaging fields in the presence of lateral eye motion, and a high-resolution LCD-based fixation target for presentation of visual cues. The system was tested in human subjects without retinal disease for performance optimization and validation. We were able to resolve and quantify cone photoreceptors across the macula to within approximately 0.5 deg (approximately 100-150 microm) of the fovea, image and delineate ten retinal layers, and penetrate to resolve features deep into the choroid. The prototype presented here is the first of a new class of powerful flexible imaging platforms that will provide clinicians and researchers with high-resolution, high performance adaptive optics imaging to help guide therapies, develop new drugs, and improve patient outcomes."

However, whether RNFL thickness is associated with specific cognitive impairment of MCI patients remains unknown. Therefore, we set out to investigate the potential association between RNFL thickness and episodic memory in MCI patients. Seventy five older adults (mean age 74 ± 3 years, 55% men) were included in the study. Fifty-two participants had normal cognition (NC), and 23 participants were diagnosed with MCI. RNFL thickness was obtained by optical coherence tomography measurement. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status on the same day of the optical examination. We found that nasal quadrant RNFL thickness was positively associated with episodic memory scores in the participants with normal cognition: word list learning (r=0.392, p=0.004) and story recall (r=0.307, p=0.027). In the participants with MCI, however, the inferior quadrant RNFL thickness was inversely associated with the episodic memory score: word list learning (r=-0.652, p=0.001), story memory (r=-0.429, p=0.041), and story recall (r=-0.502, p=0.015,). The findings from this pilot study suggest that the inferior quadrant RNFL thickness was associated with specific episodic memory in MCI patients and could serve as a biomarker of MCI and AD.

Superior sensitivity roll-off performance is shown. Imaging is demonstrated in the human retina and anterior segment. Wide field 12x12 mm data sets include the macula and optic nerve head. Small area, high density imaging shows individual cone photoreceptors. The 7.5 mm imaging range configuration can show the cornea, iris, and anterior lens in a single image. These improvements in imaging speed and depth range provide important advantages for ophthalmic imaging. The ability to rapidly acquire 3D-OCT data over a wide field of view promises to simplify examination protocols. The ability to image fine structures can provide detailed information on focal pathologies. The large imaging range and improved image penetration at 1050 m wavelengths promises to improve performance for instrumentation which images both the retina and anterior eye. These advantages suggest that swept source OCT at 1050 nm wavelengths will play an important role in future ophthalmic instrumentation."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical presentation and monitor a 3-month course using frequent optical coherence tomography (OCT) evaluations, visual field testings and lumbar opening pressure measurements. A longitudinal study of 17 patients with newly diagnosed IIH and 20 healthy overweight controls were included in the study. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and retinal thickness (RT) measurements (Stratus OCT-3, fast RNFL 3.4 protocol), and Humphrey visual field testing were evaluated at regular intervals. Repeat lumbar puncture was performed at final visit (n = 13). The diagnostic delay was 3 months and initial symptoms were headache (94%), visual blurring (82%) and pulsatile tinnitus (65%). Complete clinical remission was achieved in 65%, partial in 29% and unchanged symptoms in 6%. Total average RNFLT and RT decreased significantly during the follow-up period (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Changes in RNFLT and RT correlated with improvements in visual field mean deviation (MD) (RNFLT: p = 0.006; RT: p = 0.03) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) (RNFLT: p = 0.002; RT: p = 0.003).

They were found in 10.5% of the cases. A relatively higher frequency occurred in primiparas. No other maternal factors than parity were detected as of statistically significant influence. A slightly higher percentage in mothers with large newborn (above average cranial circumference) indicates a relationship to the necessary bearing-down effort. In a second study, 49 postpartum women with subconjunctival bleeding were examined by an ophthalmologist. Neither any intraocular or retrobulbar bleeding nor any other grievous damage to the eye were found. In accordance with the literature we recommend, that highly myopic pregnant women (even with a previous history of retinal detachment, but ophthalmologically sufficiently treated) should undergo induced delivery. However, the approach to pregnant women with retinal detachment occurring and treated during pregnancy, or to glaucoma-patients with risk to a small remaining visual field, should be more careful. In those cases, a vaginal operative delivery procedure (forceps, vacuum-extraction) is recommended. Nevertheless, one should consider individual wishes of the mother, when striving to diminish the risk to the foetus.

CD008803,0,25428543,0,Optical coherence tomography and its use in optical neuritis and multiple sclerosis.,"Optical coherence tomography is a relatively new non-invasive imaging technique used for obtaining the images and quantifying the layers of the retina. It also provides information about optic nerve head topography, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and macular volume which correlates with axonal loss. Until now, this method was used mainly in ophthalmology; now it has emerged as relevant in neurology as well. RNFL thickness is of particular interest in optic neuropathies and in multiple sclerosis. In sclerosis multiplex, axonal loss occurs as early as the first stages and the quantification of the RNFL thickness by OCT provides an indirect measure of axonal and neuronal loss in the anterior visual pathways. Because OCT is noninvasive, easy to obtain, and highly reproducible, it can be used as a marker of axonal loss and as an endpoint in clinical trials. This paper presents a comprehensive summary of the use of this new diagnostic method in multiple sclerosis patients (Fig. 1, Ref. 58)."

CD008803,0,23512142,0,Imaging of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma: pitfalls and challenges.,"Imaging has gained a key role in modern glaucoma management. Traditionally, interest was directed toward the appearance of the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer. With the improvement of the resolution of optical coherence tomography, the ganglion cell complex has also become routinely accessible in the clinic. Further advances have been made in understanding the structure-function relationship in glaucoma. Nevertheless, direct imaging of the retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma would be advantageous. With the currently used techniques, this goal cannot be achieved, because the transversal resolution is limited by aberrations of the eye. The use of adaptive optics has significantly improved transversal resolution, and the imaging of several cell types including cones and astrocytes has become possible. Imaging of retinal ganglion cells, however, still remains a problem, because of the transparency of these cells. However, the visualization of retinal ganglion cells and their dendrites has been achieved in animal models. Furthermore, attempts have been made to visualize the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells in vivo. Implementation of these techniques in clinical practice will probably improve glaucoma care and facilitate the development of neuroprotective strategies."

CD008803,0,1405393,0,[Biometric data of eyes after the onset of acute glaucoma].,"Biometric measurements were performed in 67 patients after acute glaucoma and in 67 patients of a matched control group.

There was a statistically significant difference between the glaucoma and the control group concerning the parameters subjective refraction, ocular axial length, lens thickness and the lens thickness to axial length ratio. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between corneal radius and axial length, both, in the control and the glaucoma group, a significant negative correlation between axial length and subjective refraction only in the control group. In contrast to other authors, who reported on patients with narrow angle glaucoma with and without acute attack; we found no significant difference.

CD008803,0,10969517,0,Scanning laser polarimetry in evaluation of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness for normal Taiwanese.,"Scanning laser polarimetry has been used recently for the measurement of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, taking advantage of the birefrigence of the RNFL. We observe the RNFL with the instrument and try to find out a set of normal basic values of the RNFL thickness for clinical comparison. One hundred normal volunteers of different age groups were recruited for this study. There are 44 males and 56 females with a mean (1SD) age of 36.17(14.77) years. Three consecutive 15-degree polarimetric maps were acquired for each subject. RNFL thickness measurements were obtained at 1.75 disc diameters ring from the optic nerve. Four 90-degree quadrants were identified. As a result, the average of RNFL thickness is 90.69 (20.20) microns in the superior quadrant, 80.45 (17.4) microns in the inferior quadrant, 59.28 (15.37) microns in the nasal quadrant, and 48.98 (15.72) microns in the temporal quadrant with a mean thickness value of 69.86 (13.97) microns. Superior and inferior quadrants showed a comparatively thicker nerve fiber layer than nasal and temporal quadrants. The temporal quadrant was always the lowest. The axial length does not affect the RNFL thickness and no significant difference between males and females exists. However, an obvious inverse linear correlation between age and the RNFL thickness in all quadrants is found. The average RNFL thickness decreased with age by 0.26 micron per year. (R2 = 0.081, p-value = 0.004). When compared with the normal range, age-match would be necessary."

Twenty-three eyes of 23 POAG and 20 eyes of 20 NTG Korean patients closely matched for mean deviation of automated static threshold perimetry (Humphrey Field Analyzer, program C30-2) were enrolled. The patients' mean age was 51.5 +/- 11.7 years in POAG and 55.1 +/- 10.6 years in NTG; the average mean deviation was -5.47 +/- 1.84 dB in POAG and -6.45 +/- 3.69 dB in NTG. Mean age and mean deviation were not statistically different between the two groups. Heidelberg Retina Tomograph was used to obtain topographic measurements of disc area, rim area, cup volume, cup-to-disc area ratio, mean cup depth, maximum cup depth, and cup shape measure. Disc area and cup volume were significantly larger in NTG than in POAG (p < 0.01, p = 0.03, respectively, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Other variables were not significantly different between the two groups. There was significant negative correlation between cup volume and rim area only in POAG (r = -0.725, p < 0.01, Spearman correlation analysis). These results suggest that the larger cup volume in NTG than in POAG may be influenced rather by larger optic disc in NTG not by smaller neuroretinal rim."

CD008803,0,18929102,0,Monitoring glaucoma progression.,"Monitoring progression is fundamental in managing patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma, which is as important as an early diagnosis of the disease. It is essential that both structural and functional damage be considered, in order to assure a complete and reliable assessment of progression. The optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer damage can be evaluated using either low-tech (slit lamp biomicroscopy with a 78-diopter lens) or high-tech (HRT, OCT, GDx) methods; the latter providing a more objective and standardized analysis. The current gold standard in detecting functional damage is using standard automated perimetry (SAP). Different approaches can be used to assess SAP progression: (1) clinical judgment; (2) defect classification systems; (3) trend analysis; and, (4) event analysis. Several statistical programs are currently available to assist the ophthalmologist in the difficult task of assessing progression. Clinically relevant progression should only be considered when the change--be it structural and/or functional--is statistically significant, reproducible, and indicative of glaucomatous damage."

For cross-sectional screening of patient populations, all three approaches have achieved sensitivities and specificities within the 60-80th percentile in various studies, with occasional specificities greater than 90% in select populations. Nevertheless, these methods are not likely to provide useful assistance for the experienced examiner at their present level of performance. For longitudinal change detection in individual patients, strategies for clinically specific change detection have been rigorously evaluated for confocal scanning laser tomography only. While these initial studies are encouraging, applying these algorithms in larger numbers of patients is now necessary. Future directions for these technologies are likely to include ultra-high resolution optical coherence tomography, the use of neural network/machine learning classifiers to improve clinical decision-making, and the ability to evaluate the susceptibility of individual optic nerve heads to potential damage from a given level of intraocular pressure or systemic blood pressure."

CD008803,0,20410146,0,Ocular pathology in multiple sclerosis: retinal atrophy and inflammation irrespective of disease duration.,"There has been growing interest in the use of retinal imaging for tracking disease progression in multiple sclerosis. However, systematic and detailed pathological descriptions of retinal tissue in multiple sclerosis are lacking. Graded, histological evaluations on eyes from 82 patients with multiple sclerosis and 10 subjects with other neurological diseases, with immunohistochemistry on a subset, were performed and correlated with clinical and pathological findings. Multiple sclerosis cases demonstrated evidence of retinal atrophy and inflammation even in late-stage disease. Retinal ganglion cell loss was significant and remaining neurons appeared shrunken and were partially engulfed by human leukocyte antigen-DR positive cells with the phenotype of microglia in samples subjected to immunohistochemistry. Neurofilament staining revealed variable but prominent degrees of axonal loss and injury. Neuronal loss was noted in the inner nuclear layer with focal reduction in cell density. Foamy-appearing human leukocyte antigen-DR positive cells were evident near vessels and periphlebitis was found in a small but significant number of multiple sclerosis cases. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining showed extensive astrocyte hypertrophy and proliferation with prominent gliosis in multiple sclerosis cases. Frequent but previously unreported abnormalities in the iris were documented in the majority of chronic multiple sclerosis cases. The injury to both iris and retina could be seen at all stages of disease. Severity of retinal atrophy was correlated with overall brain weight at time of autopsy (P = 0.04) and a trend for increased atrophy was seen with longer disease duration (P = 0.13). This study provides the first large-scale pathological description of retinas in multiple sclerosis, including patients with different subtypes of disease at all stages, and with variable clinical severity. Changes were seen not only in the retinal nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell layer, but also in the inner nuclear layer, suggesting that retinal injury is more widespread than previously appreciated. Furthermore, the human retina is devoid of myelin, but inflammation was demonstrated to be prominent in multiple sclerosis and to persist in the retina at late stages of disease. The prominent gliosis and inflammation surrounding vessels of the inner retina could potentially impact optical coherence tomography evaluations in multiple sclerosis-as standard techniques exploit presumed differences in tissue reflectivity and utilize automated edge detection algorithms to judge axon loss in the nerve fibre layer. Deciphering the relationships between the different types of retinal pathology may aid us in understanding the factors that drive both inflammation and tissue atrophy in multiple sclerosis."

We screened 135 unrelated index cases, selected in five different settings: SPG7-positive patients detected during SPG31 analysis using SPG31/SPG7 multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (n = 7); previously reported ambiguous SPG7 cases (n = 5); patients carefully selected on the basis of their phenotype (spasticity of the lower limbs with cerebellar signs and/or cerebellar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging/computer tomography scan and/or optic neuropathy and without other signs) (n = 24); patients with hereditary spastic paraparesis referred consecutively from attending neurologists and the national reference centre in a diagnostic setting (n = 98); and the index case of a four-generation family with autosomal dominant optic neuropathy but no spasticity linked to the SPG7 locus. We identified two SPG7 mutations in 23/134 spastic patients, 21% of the patients selected according to phenotype but only 8% of those referred directly. Our results confirm the pathogenicity of Ala510Val, which was the most frequent mutation in our series (65%) and segregated at the homozygous state with spastic paraparesis in a large family with autosomal recessive inheritance. All SPG7-positive patients tested had optic neuropathy or abnormalities revealed by optical coherence tomography, indicating that abnormalities in optical coherence tomography could be a clinical biomarker for SPG7 testing. In addition, the presence of late-onset very slowly progressive spastic gait (median age 39 years, range 18-52 years) associated with cerebellar ataxia (39%) or cerebellar atrophy (47%) constitute, with abnormal optical coherence tomography, key features pointing towards SPG7-testing. Interestingly, three relatives of patients with heterozygote SPG7 mutations had cerebellar signs and atrophy, or peripheral neuropathy, but no spasticity of the lower limbs, suggesting that SPG7 mutations at the heterozygous state might predispose to late-onset neurodegenerative disorders, mimicking autosomal dominant inheritance. Finally, a novel missense SPG7 mutation at the heterozygous state (Asp411Ala) was identified as the cause of autosomal dominant optic neuropathy in a large family, indicating that some SPG7 mutations can occasionally be dominantly inherited and be an uncommon cause of isolated optic neuropathy. Altogether, these results emphasize the clinical variability associated with SPG7 mutations, ranging from optic neuropathy to spastic paraplegia, and support the view that SPG7 screening should be carried out in both conditions."

One temporal superior retinal vessel pair passing through a concentric ring (zone B), which was defined between half and one disc distance from the optic disc border, was chosen for the measurement using a volume scan in SD-OCT. On the SD-OCT image, retinal arteriolar outer diameter (RAOD), retinal arteriolar lumen diameter (RALD), retinal venular outer diameter (RVOD) and retinal venular lumen diameter (RVLD) were measured. Retinal vessel diameters on color fundus photographs were also analyzed. Fifty-five healthy individuals were recruited to evaluate intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility between the two examiners. The intraobserver intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) ranged from 0.972 to 0.981, and the interobserver ICC ranged from 0.968 to 0.980. In the Bland-Altman plot, the 95% limits of interobserver agreement for the RAOD, RALD, RVOD and RVLD were -5.60 to 4.84μm, -5.78 to 5.05μm, -7.52 to 5.62μm and -7.10 to 5.63μm, respectively. The retinal arteriolar and venular lumen diameters on the SD-OCT image were close to the mean arteriolar and venular diameters obtained from the color fundus photographs. Volume scan method produced better images of retinal vessels showing the fine structures of the vessel wall, and provided reliable retinal vessel structure measurement in zone B with good repeatability and reproducibility."

CD008803,0,22539259,0,Microcystic macular oedema in multiple sclerosis is associated with disease severity.,"Macular oedema typically results from blood-retinal barrier disruption. It has recently been reported that patients with multiple sclerosis treated with FTY-720 (fingolimod) may exhibit macular oedema. Multiple sclerosis is not otherwise thought to be associated with macular oedema except in the context of comorbid clinical uveitis. Despite a lack of myelin, the retina is a site of inflammation and microglial activation in multiple sclerosis and demonstrates significant neuronal and axonal loss. We unexpectedly observed microcystic macular oedema using spectral domain optical coherence tomography in patients with multiple sclerosis who did not have another reason for macular oedema. We therefore evaluated spectral domain optical coherence tomography images in consecutive patients with multiple sclerosis for microcystic macular oedema and examined correlations between macular oedema and visual and ambulatory disability in a cross-sectional analysis. Participants were excluded if there was a comorbidity that could account for the presence of macular oedema, such as uveitis, diabetes or other retinal disease. A microcystic pattern of macular oedema was observed on optical coherence tomography in 15 of 318 (4.7%) patients with multiple sclerosis. No macular oedema was identified in 52 healthy controls assessed over the same period. The microcystic oedema predominantly involved the inner nuclear layer of the retina and tended to occur in small, discrete patches. Patients with multiple sclerosis with microcystic macular oedema had significantly worse disability [median Expanded Disability Score Scale 4 (interquartile range 3-6)] than patients without macular oedema [median Expanded Disability Score Scale 2 (interquartile range 1.5-3.5)], P = 0.0002. Patients with multiple sclerosis with microcystic macular oedema also had higher Multiple Sclerosis Severity Scores, a measure of disease progression, than those without oedema [median of 6.47 (interquartile range 4.96-7.98) versus 3.65 (interquartile range 1.92-5.87), P = 0.0009]. Microcystic macular oedema occurred more commonly in eyes with prior optic neuritis than eyes without prior optic neuritis (50 versus 27%) and was associated with lower visual acuity (median logMAR acuity of 0.17 versus -0.1) and a thinner retinal nerve fibre layer. The presence of microcystic macular oedema in multiple sclerosis suggests that there may be breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier and tight junction integrity in a part of the nervous system that lacks myelin. Microcystic macular oedema may also contribute to visual dysfunction beyond that explained by nerve fibre layer loss. Microcystic changes need to be assessed, and potentially adjusted for, in clinical trials that evaluate macular volume as a marker of retinal ganglion cell survival. These findings also have implications for clinical monitoring in patients with multiple sclerosis on sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulating agents."

CD008803,0,22089500,0,"Vision in multiple sclerosis: the story, structure-function correlations, and models for neuroprotection.","Visual dysfunction is one of the most common clinical manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS). Just over a decade ago, MS clinical trials did not include visual outcomes, but experts recognized the need for more sensitive measures of visual function. Low-contrast letter acuity emerged as the leading candidate to measure visual disability in MS, and subsequent studies found low-contrast acuity testing to correlate well with brain MRI lesion burden, visual-evoked potentials, quality of life (QOL), and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) loss, as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT in MS has allowed for assessment of structure-function correlations that make the anterior visual pathway and acute optic neuritis (ON) ideal models for testing novel agents for neuroprotection and repair. New therapies that reduce axonal loss by neuroprotective or myelin repair mechanisms can now be assessed noninvasively by OCT and coupled with visual function data. Based on OCT studies in MS, RNFL thickness is reduced significantly among patients (92 μm) vs controls (105 μm) and is particularly reduced in MS eyes with a history of ON (85 μm). Worsening of visual function by a clinically significant ≥ 7 letters or approximately 1.5 lines for low-contrast acuity is associated with approximately 4.5 μm reductions in RNFL thickness in MS eyes. Longitudinal studies of OCT have also shown RNFL axonal loss over time that occurs even in the absence of acute ON and that correlates with clinically meaningful worsening of vision and QOL, even in patients with benign MS. The latest OCT investigations involve high-resolution spectral-domain (SD) OCT with segmentation and measurement of specific retinal layers using computerized algorithms. These methods allow quantitation of ganglion cell (neuronal) layer loss and axonal degeneration in MS in vivo. In this review, we examine the data from these studies and ongoing trials that highlight the entity of ON as a model to investigate neuroprotection and neurorepair. In doing so, we also present representative group data from studies that have examined visual function, OCT measures, and QOL scales in patients with MS and ON and disease-free controls. These data, and those from recent meta-analyses, may be used to provide reference values for the development of clinical trial protocols."

An axial resolution of 7.4 microm, ranging depth of 4.2 mm in tissue, sensitivity of 98.5 dB, and detection speed of 38,300 axial scans/s have been achieved. These are comparable or superior to those of recently commercially available ophthalmic 830 nm SD-OCTs in clinics. In addition, fast volumetric imaging for the in vivo human posterior eye with high-contrast of the choroid is achieved. A broadband 1.04 microm light source enables the high-contrast and high resolution imaging of the retina and choroid. The ranging depth is extended by applying a full-range imaging method with an electro-optic modulator (BM-scan method). A prototype high-speed InGaAs line scan camera with 1024 pixels is used. A newly reported sensitivity improvement property of the BM-scan method demonstrates a sensitivity enhancement of 5.1 dB. We also introduce a newly developed resampling calibration method of spectrum that is independent of the intrinsic dispersion mismatch of the interferometer.

The instrument is an advanced imaging technique that provides unprecedented high resolution and cross-sectional tomographic images of the ocular microstructure in situ, and in real time. Since its introduction about four years ago, a multitude of advantages has made OCT an essential instrument in ophthalmic imaging. The technique has fast image acquisition speed and non-contact, non-invasive applicability, allowing a non-excisional 'optical biopsy' to be performed. The purpose of this paper is to provide an evidence-based review of the increasing role of OCT in the diagnosis and management of ocular disorders, particularly in age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular oedema, macular hole, epiretinal membrane and glaucoma. Being one of the first users of OCT in Australia, our clinical experiences will be highlighted and clinical examples of various conditions will be presented to provide an overview of the immense implications of OCT in practice. The latest developments of the OCT revolution, in relation to combining OCT with fundus photography and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, will also be described. New developments of three-dimensional visualisation of tissue morphology with future models of ultra-high speed, ultra-high resolution OCT may further enhance the early diagnosis, monitoring of disease progression and assessment of treatment efficacy, facilitated by this powerful technology."

Optic nerve represents an ideal model to study the consequences of axonal loss and demyelination on MTR since effects of disease on the optic nerve are clinically apparent and potentially quantifiable by objective means. By measuring the latency of multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEP) (measure of optic nerve conduction) and Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness (measure of axonal damage) we investigated the effect of neurodegeneration and demyelination on MTR after an episode of optic neuritis (ON).

We examined 105 patients: 49 with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), 26 with low-tension glaucoma (LTG) and 10 with ocular hypertension (OH), and as a control-group 20 healthy eyes. The glaucoma stage had been defined by examination of the central visual field with the Octopus Perimeter 201 program 31 or 32 and/or the Humphrey Perimeter GG program. In healthy eyes, eyes with OH and POAG stage I (n = 19), no nerve fiber bundle defect could be found. In stage II (n = 15) and stage III (n = 14) we found nerve fiber bundle defects in all patients with POAG and LTG (except for one patient with POAG stage III). In stage IV (n = 27) no localized nerve fiber bundle defects were detected in eyes with POAG, but in 4 of 7 patients with LTG, defects could be seen. In glaucoma stages II and III, nerve fiber bundle defects can be detected with the HRT. The control group shows, that the appearance of a nerve fiber bundle defect is no artifact caused by the HRT. However, examination of eyes with OH and POAG stage I also shows that this method is not sensitive enough to be useful for early diagnosis of glaucoma. Nevertheless, it may be possible to develop the confocal HRT method further as a nerve-fiber diagnostic method for glaucoma."

Photography established a mean ONH-foveal angle of 7.03 degrees (SD 2.94 degrees). Comparison with the indirect/protractor method revealed a mean difference of 1.10 degrees (SD 0.99) with a range of 0 degrees to 4 degrees between methods. The indirect/protractor method seems to provide a rapid, inexpensive, and accurate method of determining the degree of ocular torsion when compared to the fundus photograph method which requires greater patient cooperation and investment in time and equipment. The ONH-foveal angle varies widely among normal individuals (0 degrees to 16 degrees). Variation between left and right eyes of the same individual was not significant (1.15 degrees, SD 1.39 degrees), and if greater than 4 degrees, probably represents cyclovertical muscle dysfunction or restrictive orbitopathy. The converse, however, may not always be true as individuals with less than 4 degrees difference between eyes may have cyclovertical muscle imbalance."

This study is aimed at evaluating the LHON symptoms in rats administered with rotenone microspheres into the superior colliculus (SC). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis showed substantial loss of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in rotenone injected rats. Optokinetic testing in rotenone treated rats showed decrease in head-tracking response. Electrophysiological mapping of the SC surface demonstrated attenuation of visually evoked responses; however, no changes were observed in the ERG data. The progressive pattern of disease manifestation in rotenone administered rats demonstrated several similarities with human disease symptoms.

CD008803,0,22759443,0,Multimodal retinal vessel segmentation from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and fundus photography.,"Segmenting retinal vessels in optic nerve head (ONH) centered spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volumes is particularly challenging due to the projected neural canal opening (NCO) and relatively low visibility in the ONH center. Color fundus photographs provide a relatively high vessel contrast in the region inside the NCO, but have not been previously used to aid the SD-OCT vessel segmentation process. Thus, in this paper, we present two approaches for the segmentation of retinal vessels in SD-OCT volumes that each take advantage of complimentary information from fundus photographs. In the first approach (referred to as the registered-fundus vessel segmentation approach), vessels are first segmented on the fundus photograph directly (using a k-NN pixel classifier) and this vessel segmentation result is mapped to the SD-OCT volume through the registration of the fundus photograph to the SD-OCT volume. In the second approach (referred to as the multimodal vessel segmentation approach), after fundus-to-SD-OCT registration, vessels are simultaneously segmented with a k -NN classifier using features from both modalities. Three-dimensional structural information from the intraretinal layers and neural canal opening obtained through graph-theoretic segmentation approaches of the SD-OCT volume are used in combination with Gaussian filter banks and Gabor wavelets to generate the features. The approach is trained on 15 and tested on 19 randomly chosen independent image pairs of SD-OCT volumes and fundus images from 34 subjects with glaucoma. Based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the present registered-fundus and multimodal vessel segmentation approaches [area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 and 0.89, respectively] both perform significantly better than the two previous OCT-based approaches (AUC of 0.78 and 0.83, p < 0.05). The multimodal approach overall performs significantly better than the other three approaches (p < 0.05)."

CD008803,0,23864285,0,Early and late inner retinal changes after inner limiting membrane peeling.,"Pars plana vitrectomy and inner limiting membrane (ILM) peeling are standard procedures for macular hole and epiretinal membrane surgery. However, ILM peeling is known to cause mechanical traumatic changes to the retinal nerve fiber layer. Recently there have been numerous reports of anatomical changes in the macula after ILM removal. A comprehensive review of the literature. The earliest change in the macula after ILM peeling is post-operative swelling of the arcuate retinal nerve fiber layer (SANFL), which disappears within the 3 month; the swelling is not detected on biomicroscopic fundus examination but appears as hypoautofluorescent arcuate striae in the macular region on infrared and autofluorescence imaging, with corresponding hyperreflectant swelling demonstrated on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). SANFL is followed by dissociated optic nerve fiber layer defect, faintly visible on fundus examination and corresponding on OCT to ""dimples"" in the inner retinal layers. The en face tomographic aspect of this defect appears as concentric macular dark spots. Post-operative foveal displacement toward the optic disc might be responsible for the stretching and thinning of the retinal parenchyma in the temporal subfield and the thickening of the nasal macula. This shortening of the papillofoveal distance after surgery is probably secondary to axonal transport and contractility alterations in the nerve fiber layer, which might also account for apoptotic and atrophic degeneration of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer. Ganglion cells do not seem to be affected by ILM peeling, even if the ganglion cell complex loses some volume because of trauma to the Müller cells contained in the ganglion cell layer. Despite its clear indication in macular hole and epiretinal membrane surgery, ILM peeling is a traumatic procedure that has acute effects on the underlying inner retinal layers. Further investigation of these subclinical changes may assist in aiding the development of minimally traumatic techniques for ILM removal."

CD008803,0,24424177,0,Diagnosis and classification of autoimmune optic neuropathy.,"The spectrum of autoimmune optic neuropathies (ON) is extending. The phenotypic spectrum includes single isolated optic neuritis (SION), relapsing isolated optic neuritis (RION), chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION), the neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis associated optic neuritis (MSON) and unclassified optic neuritis (UCON) forms. Epidemiological data suggests a slight female predominance. The ethnic heritage is relevant as Caucasian patients are more likely to suffer from MSON, whilst SION, RION, CRION and NMO are more frequent in non-Caucasian patients. Importantly, prognosis for recovery of visual function is good in MSON, but poorer in NMO and CRION which also have a high chance for recurrent episodes. Testing for serum anti-AQP4 autoantibodies is advised in all patients with severe, atypical or recurrent ON because of the high diagnostic specificity. The diagnostic specificity may be aided by testing for glial biomarkers in the CSF and prognostic accuracy by testing for biomarkers for neuroaxonal degeneration. Optical coherence tomography is a highly accurate tool to document the final outcome. The current clinical classification criteria rely on the phenotype, response to treatment and presence of anti-AQP4 autoantibodies."

The advances in imaging devices that reveal structural changes in glaucoma should facilitate reliable diagnosis of early or preperimetric glaucoma and a proper evaluation of glaucoma progression. Moreover, the increase in our knowledge of structural changes in glaucoma will provide a better platform for investigating up to now unknown glaucoma etiologies. In this review, we summarize a series of our clinical investigations of glaucoma imaging technologies. The diagnostic performance of Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) II and the characteristics of the HRT II parameters in high myopia were studied with population-based data to provide data for nerve head configuration; the correlation of parameters determined by planimetry of optic disc stereophotography with the results of the HRT II was evaluated; optic disc parameters were determined based on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT); and optic disc configurations were evaluated in eyes with peripapillary atrophy and eyes with superior segmental optic nerve hypoplasia. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was determined with SD-OCT in normal Japanese eyes; and the diagnostic performance of RNFL thickness was studied. The characteristics of each layer, including retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, and each complex layer in the macular area, and their correlation with the stages of glaucoma were evaluated. Finally, imaging of the anterior chamber angle using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) were studied about the distribution of the UBM parameters in a Japanese population and the factors relating to the presence of peripheral anterior synechia in narrow angle eyes."

CD008803,0,21478787,0,The Glenn A. Fry award lecture 2010: Ophthalmic markers of diabetic neuropathy.,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a debilitating condition that affects about 50% of diabetic patients. The symptoms of DPN include numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs. Patients with numbness may be unaware of foot trauma, which could develop into a foot ulcer. If left untreated, this may ultimately require amputation. Currently, the only method of directly examining peripheral nerves is to conduct skin punch or sural/peroneal nerve biopsies, which are uncomfortable and invasive. Indirect methods include quantitative sensory testing (assessing responses to heat, cold, and vibration) and nerve electrophysiology. Here, I describe research undertaken in my laboratory, investigating the possibility of using a range of ophthalmic markers to assess DPN. Corneal nerve structure and function can be assessed using corneal confocal microscopy and non-contact corneal esthesiometry, respectively. Retinal nerve structure and visual function can be evaluated using optical coherence tomography and perimetry, respectively. These techniques have been used to demonstrate that DPN is associated with morphological degradation of corneal nerves, reduced corneal sensitivity, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and peripheral visual field loss. With further validation, these ophthalmic markers could become established as rapid, painless, non-invasive, sensitive, reiterative, cost-effective, and clinically accessible means of screening for early detection, diagnosis, staging severity, and monitoring progression of DPN, as well as assessing the effectiveness of possible therapeutic interventions. Looking to the future, this research may pave the way for an expanded role for the ophthalmic professions in diabetes management."

CD008803,0,19526469,0,Histogram-based filtering for quantitative 3D retinal angiography.,Doppler Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (D-FDOCT) can be used to visualise and measure ocular blood flow in the retina of the human eye. This has the potential to diagnose illnesses such as macula degeneration or diabetic retinopathy early on because these medical conditions cause a pathological change in the retinal vasculature and perfusion. Here we are presenting a method to separate quantitative blood flow information from static tissue. Our approach is demonstrated on retinal D-FDOCT volume scans taken at the optic nerve head (see figure) and near the fovea with a high speed CMOS-based FDOCT system. The advantage of this method is the small post-processing effort together with the immediate availability of segmented quantitative Doppler flow maps. The performance of the filtering technique is also compared to spatial frequency filtering methods.

However, the accuracy of DRPT might be altered because that after emerging from the dark room, the configuration of the angle is affected by the light of the slit-lamp and the appositionally closed angle reopens. The aim of this study was to examine the pupillary diameter in different light conditions and use it as a parameter to assess the accuracy of dark-room provocative test."

To study the relationship between macular cone structure, fundus autofluorescence (AF), and visual function in patients with Stargardt disease (STGD). METHODS. High-resolution images of the macula were obtained with adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography in 12 patients with STGD and 27 age-matched healthy subjects. Measures of retinal structure and AF were correlated with visual function, including best-corrected visual acuity, color vision, kinetic and static perimetry, fundus-guided microperimetry, and full-field electroretinography. Mutation analysis of the ABCA4 gene was completed in all patients. RESULTS. Patients were 15 to 55 years old, and visual acuity ranged from 20/25-20/320. Central scotomas were present in all patients, although the fovea was spared in three patients. The earliest cone spacing abnormalities were observed in regions of homogeneous AF, normal visual function, and normal outer retinal structure. Outer retinal structure and AF were most normal near the optic disc. Longitudinal studies showed progressive increases in AF followed by reduced AF associated with losses of visual sensitivity, outer retinal layers, and cones. At least one disease-causing mutation in the ABCA4 gene was identified in 11 of 12 patients studied; 1 of 12 patients showed no disease-causing ABCA4 mutations. CONCLUSIONS. AOSLO imaging demonstrated abnormal cone spacing in regions of abnormal fundus AF and reduced visual function. These findings provide support for a model of disease progression in which lipofuscin accumulation results in homogeneously increased AF with cone spacing abnormalities, followed by heterogeneously increased AF with cone loss, then reduced AF with cone and RPE cell death."

Previous studies have shown that degenerative changes occur in optic nerve fibers and are manifested as thinning of RNLF in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are no studies on the thickness of the RNLF in other types of dementia, such as dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. In this study, patients fulfilling diagnostic for AD (n = 10), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 10), dementia associated with Parkinson's disease (n = 10), and cognitively normal age-matched controls (n = 10) underwent optical coherence tomography examinations to measure RNLF thickness. There was a significant decrease in RNLF thickness in each type of dementia compared to the control group (Mann-Whitney test, all p < 0.001). Although patients with dementia with Lewy bodies may have a greater thinning than both patients with AD and dementia associated with Parkinson's disease, the differences were statistically nonsignificant (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.525). The thickness of the RNLF correlated significantly (p < 0.001) with both the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale scores in all types of dementia; that is to say, the greater the cognitive deterioration, the greater the reduction of thickness of the RNLF. The findings from this study show that retinal involvement measured by optical coherence tomography may also be present in non-AD dementias."

CD008803,0,21349793,0,Automated diagnosis of glaucoma using texture and higher order spectra features.,"Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. It is a disease in which fluid pressure in the eye increases continuously, damaging the optic nerve and causing vision loss. Computational decision support systems for the early detection of glaucoma can help prevent this complication. The retinal optic nerve fiber layer can be assessed using optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry, and Heidelberg retina tomography scanning methods. In this paper, we present a novel method for glaucoma detection using a combination of texture and higher order spectra (HOS) features from digital fundus images. Support vector machine, sequential minimal optimization, naive Bayesian, and random-forest classifiers are used to perform supervised classification. Our results demonstrate that the texture and HOS features after z-score normalization and feature selection, and when combined with a random-forest classifier, performs better than the other classifiers and correctly identifies the glaucoma images with an accuracy of more than 91%. The impact of feature ranking and normalization is also studied to improve results. Our proposed novel features are clinically significant and can be used to detect glaucoma accurately."

CD008803,0,23138681,0,Test-retest variability in structural parameters measured with glaucoma imaging devices.,"In addition to classical stereo-disc photography, various glaucoma imaging devices were developed in the last two decades to quantitatively measure and record glaucoma-related structural parameters of the eye. In determining whether or not the glaucomatous damage progressed from baseline and in estimating the number of test results' optimal frequency needed to confirm disease progression, information relating to the test-retest variability of measurement results provided by each imaging device is indispensable. Such information enables the clinician to apply these devices in practice. The test-retest variability of a system is usually estimated using the Bland-Altman analysis and by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and minimum detectable changes (MDC). The reported CV, ICC, and MDC values for glaucoma-related structural parameter measurement results of stereo-disc photographs, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopes, scanning laser polarimeters, time-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT), anterior-segment OCT, and ultrasound biomicroscope are systematically reviewed in this manuscript, which will enable the clinician to interpret measurement results provided by each glaucoma imaging devices and thus be useful in practice.

In our study four examiners independently estimated the C/D ratios of 40 patients by direct ophthalmoscopy using a contour criterion for cup determination. Results indicated that 75% of the estimate pairs differed by 0.10 or less. Fewer than 14% of the estimate pairs differed by 0.2 or greater.

CD008803,0,8970866,0,The normalised rim/disc area ratio line.,"The assessment of the cup of the optic disc depends, among other criteria, on the disc area. A small cup in a small optic disc can indicate an advanced glaucomatous lesion, on the other hand a large cup in a large optic disc can be normal. Therefore, an individual normalised rim/disc area ratio line together with the curves of 50th percentile and the 95th percentile of normal could help to better distinguish between glaucomatous and normal optic cups. The aim of our study was to calculate and to evaluate such a normalised rim/disc area ratio line. Heidelberg Retina Tomograph examinations of the optic nerve head of 100 randomly selected eyes of 100 normal subjects were evaluated. We calculated the disc area adjusted rim/disc area ratio in sectors of 10 degrees. The 95th percentile and the 50th percentile of each of the 36 sectors were calculated. Based on these normal percentile lines it was possible to display an individual normalised rim/disc area ratio line in the topographic images of an individual optic disc examination. Here we demonstrated examples of a normal optic disc, optic nerve heads with moderate and advanced lesions and a small optic disc with glaucomatous damage. We present a new display mode of the results of Heidelberg Retina Tomograph optic nerve head examination, which may be helpful for an easy and reliable assessment of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage only looking at topographic images."

A total of 64 normal eyes from 32 Korean volunteers were enrolled in this study. A GDx Nerve Fiber Analyzer with software version 2.0.09 was used to image all subjects. Optic disc size was measured by pi x (horizontal radius) x (vertical radius). The RNFL density of each quadrant was calculated by dividing each quadrant integral by the total integral. Optic disc size was positively correlated with the total RNFL thickness (r = 0.615, p < 0.01). Optic disc size and RNFL density were inversely related in the superior quadrant (r = -0.248, p < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between optic disc size and RNFL density in the nasal quadrant (r = 0.439, p < 0.01) and the temporal quadrant to a certain degree. A significant positive correlation was found between the right and left eyes in terms of total RNFL thickness in and that of each quadrant. Interocular RNFL density was positively correlated in both the temporal and nasal quadrants. These findings must be considered when one evaluates and compares RNFL measurements between two eyes as is often the case where both eyes are usually affected in the course of glaucomatous RNFL damage."

The mean of the average RNFL thickness over the entire 360 degrees in the control group was 92.5 +/- 12.9 microm which was significantly thinner than the normative data of 95.9 +/- 11.4 microm included with the OCT3000 (p < 0.01). The RNFL thickness decreased with increasing age (p < 0.01, r = -0.395). The RNFL thickness was also measured in 53 eyes of 53 patients with glaucoma whose superior (13 eyes) or inferior (40 eyes) perimetric hemifields were normal. Only the RNFL thickness corresponding to the preserved perimetric hemifields were measured by OCT3000 and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO). The RNFL thickness in the superior and inferior 30 degrees sectors, the maximum and average RNFL thickness in the superior (S(max) and S(avg)), and inferior quadrants (I(max) and I(avg)) were analyzed. The S(max), S(avg), I(max), I(avg), and the RNFL thickness in the superior (p < 0.05), superotemporal and inferotemporal sectors (p < 0.01) in the glaucoma patients without a nerve fiber layer defect (SLO) were significantly thinner than in the control subjects in same age.

In a group of 12 eyes with non-arteritic AION the authors performed the measurements of the average RNFL thickness by means of OCT. The measurements were taken peripapillary and in the macular region. The measurements were taken in the acute phase of the disease and at least three months after the beginning of the disease during a follow-up control. At the time of both examinations, the static perimetry was performed as well. All findings were compared to each other. During the follow-up period, the authors proved statistically significant decrease of the thickness of the RNFL. The mean thickness in the acute phase (mean +/- SD) was 219.26 +/- 61.02 microm, decreased at the follow-up control to 69.44 +/- 20.40 microm.

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Despite major advances in imaging techniques, the pathogenesis of glaucoma remains poorly understood at present. The lamina cribrosa (LC) is the presumed site of axonal injury in glaucoma. Its thinning and deformation have been suggested to contribute to glaucoma development and progression by impeding axoplasmic flow within the optic nerve fibers, leading to apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells. To visualize the deep ocular structures such as the choroid and the LC, OCT imaging has been used, particularly the enhanced depth imaging (EDI)-OCT modality of spectral domain (SD)-OCT. However, the posterior laminar surface especially is not seen clearly using this method. A new generation of OCTs, swept-source (SS)-OCT, is able to image the LC and the choroid in vivo. SS-OCT employs a longer wavelength compared with the conventional OCT, generally set at 1050 nm (instead of 840 nm).

Forty-four MS patients and 30 healthy subjects underwent optical coherence tomography. DTI was analysed with a voxel-based whole brain and region-based analysis of optic radiation, corpus callosum and further white matter. Correlations between RNFL, fractional anisotropy (FA) and other DTI-based parameters were assessed in patients and controls. RNFL correlated with optic radiation FA, but also with corpus callosum and remaining white matter FA. Our findings demonstrate that RNFL changes indicate white matter damage exceeding the visual pathway."

Twenty eyes of 11 patients with VF defects that respect the vertical meridian were enrolled retrospectively. The thicknesses of the macular GCIPL and pRNFL were measured using Cirrus HD-OCT. The 5 and 1% thinning area index (TAI) was calculated as the proportion of abnormally thin sectors at the 5 and 1% probability level within the area corresponding to the affected VF. The 5 and 1% TAI were compared between the GCIPL and pRNFL measurements. The color-coded GCIPL deviation map showed a characteristic vertical thinning pattern of the GCIPL, which is also seen in the VF of patients with brain lesions. The 5 and 1% TAI were significantly higher in the GCIPL measurements than in the pRNFL measurements (all p < 0.01). Macular GCIPL analysis clearly visualized a characteristic topographic pattern of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss in patients with VF defects that respect the vertical meridian, unlike pRNFL measurements. Macular GCIPL measurements provide more valuable information than pRNFL measurements for detecting the loss of RGCs in patients with retrograde degeneration of the optic nerve fibers."

Macular subfoveal, nasal, temporal and average choroidal thicknesses were measured in one eye of 17 healthy individuals and 40 glaucoma patients using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography before and after pupil dilation. Comparisons were made between pre- and post-dilation measurements, and between normal and glaucomatous eyes. No statistically significant differences were found between pre- and post-dilation choroidal thickness measurements both in normal (p = 0.361 for subfoveal, 0.760 for nasal, 0.941 for temporal, 0.881 for average) and glaucomatous eyes (p = 0.687 for subfoveal, 0.340 for nasal, 0.913 for temporal, and 0.642 for average). After adjusting for age, the comparison between normal and glaucomatous eyes showed no significant differences in measurements both before (p = 0.701-0.907) and after pupil dilation (p = 0.757-0.988). Similar results were obtained for measurements unadjusted for age. Measurements obtained under the two conditions correlated well in normal (r = 0.92-0.97, p < 0.001) and in glaucomatous eyes (r = 0.84-0.98, p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analyses showed good agreements between them in both groups of eyes, with mean difference ranges of 0.43-2.86 and 0.39-3.08 μm between pre- and post-dilation measurements in normal and glaucomatous eyes, respectively. Subfoveal and average choroidal thickness decreased significantly by 2 μm/year. Each millimeter increase in axial length decreased subfoveal choroidal thickness by 16.5 μm and average thickness by 14.1 μm.

Seventy-six eyes of 38 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of unilateral FUS were recruited into this prospective, cross-sectional and comparative study. After a complete ocular examination, anterior segment biometric parameters were measured by Visante(®) AS-OCT. All parameters were compared between the two eyes of each patient statistically. The mean age of the 38 subjects was 32.5 ± 7.5 years (18 female and 20 male). The mean visual acuity was lower in eyes with FUS (0.55 ± 0.31) than in healthy eyes (0.93 ± 0.17). The central corneal thickness did not differ significantly between eyes. All iridocorneal angle parameters (angle-opening distance 500 and 750, scleral spur angle, trabecular-iris space (TISA) 500 and 750) except TISA 500 in temporal quadrant were significantly larger in eyes with FUS than in healthy eyes. Anterior chamber depth was deeper in the eyes with FUS than in the unaffected eyes. With regard to iris measurements, iris thickness in the thickest part, iris bowing and iris shape were all statistically different between the affected eye and the healthy eye in individual patients with FUS. However, no statistically significant differences were evident in iris thickness 500 μm, thickness in the middle and iris length. There were significant difference in iris shape between the two eyes of patients with glaucoma. AS-OCT as an imaging method provides us with many informative resultsin the analysis of anterior segment parameters in FUS."

CD008803,0,21945611,0,Minimising retinal vessel artefacts in optical coherence tomography images.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is commonly used to investigate the layers of the retina including retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). OCT images are altered by vessels on the retinal surface producing artefacts. We propose a new approach to compensate for these artefacts and enhance quality of OCT images. A total of 28 (20 normal and 8 glaucoma subjects) OCT images were obtained using Spectralis (Heidelberg, Germany). Shadows were detected along the image and compensated by the A-Scan intensity difference from surrounding non-affected areas. Images were then segmented and the area and thickness of RNFL and RPE were measured and compared. 10 subjects were tested twice to determine the effect of this on reproducibility of measurements. Shadow-suppressed images reflected the profile of the retinal layers more closely when assessed qualitatively, minimising distortion. The segmentation of RNFL and RPE thickness demonstrated a mean change of 2.4% ± 1 and 6% ± 1 from the original images. Much larger changes were observed in areas with vessels. Reproducibility of RNFL thickness was improved, specifically in the higher density vessel location, i.e. inferior and superior. Therefore, OCT images can be enhanced by an image processing procedure. Vessel artefacts may cause errors in assessment of RNFL thickness and are a source of variability, which has clinical implications for diseases such as glaucoma where subtle changes in RNFL need to be monitored accurately over time."

In the adult, RPF-1 is expressed only within the CNS, where its expression is restricted to the medical habenulla, to a dispersed population of neurons in the dorsal hypothalamus, and to subsets of ganglion and amacrine cells in the retina. The human RPF-1 gene spans > 125 kb and gives rise to multiple differentially spliced transcripts. In the human retina, the most abundant mRNA isoforms are derived from an alternate splicing event that inserts an evolutionarily conserved peptide of 36 amino acids into the DNA recognition helix of the POU-specific domain. In vitro, the RPF-1 POU domain lacking the insert binds to a consensus Oct-1 binding site, whereas the alternately spliced POU domain does not. RPF-1 protein first appears in the developing mouse retina at e11, where it localizes to neuroblasts that have recently migrated from the mitotic zone to the future ganglion cell layer. These data suggest that RPF-1 is likely to be involved in early steps in the differentiation of amacrine and ganglion cells."

The other processing techniques used are morphological opening, extended maxima operator, minima imposition, and watershed transformation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the test images of STARE and DRIVE databases with fixed and variable thresholds. The images drawn by human expert are taken as the reference images. The proposed method yields sensitivity values as high as 96.7%, which are better than the results reported in the literature."
CD008803,0,24864434,0,[Nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy animal model and its treatment applications].,"Nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is one of the most common acute unilaterally onset optic nerve diseases. One management problem in terms of NAION is the difficulty of differential diagnosis between NAION and anterior optic neuritis (ON). A second problem is that there is no established treatment for the acute stage of NAION. A third problem is that there is no preventive treatment for a subsequent attack on the fellow eye, estimated to occur in 15 to 25% of patients with NAION. For differentiation of acute NAION from anterior optic neuritis, we investigated the usefulness of laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG). In the normal control group, the tissue blood flow did not significantly differ between the right and left eyes. In the NAION group, all 6 patients had 29.5% decreased mean blur rate (MBR), which correlates to optic disc blood flow, of the NAION eye compared with the unaffected eye. In the anterior ON group, all 6 cases had 15.9% increased MBR of the anterior ON eye compared with the unaffected eye. Thus, LSFG showed a difference of the underlying pathophysiology between NAION and anterior ON despite showing disc swelling in both groups and could be useful for differentiating both groups. For the treatment of acute stage of NAION, we tried to reproduce the rodent model of NAION (rNAION) developed by Bernstein and colleagues. To induce rNAION, after the administration of rose bengal(RB) (2.5 mM) into the tail vein of SD rats, the small vessels of the left optic nerve were photoactivated using a 514 nm argon green laser (RB-laser-induction). In the RB-laser-induction eyes, the capillaries within the optic disc were reduced markedly, the optic disc became swollen, and fluorescein angiography showed filling defect in the choroid and the optic disc at an early stage, followed by hyperfluorescence at a late stage. Electrophysiological evaluation revealed that visual evoked potential (VEP) amplitude was significantly decreased but an electroretinogram (ERG) did not show a significant difference either in the b wave or in the oscillatory potentials. The scotopic threshold response (STR) was significantly reduced 3 days after induction. These findings are similar to those of rNAION and indicate that we succeeded in reproducing the rNAION. Histopathologic examination in the acute phase of rNAION, showed acellular NFL swelling anterior to the optic disc. No accumulation of inflammatory cells was noted in several microscopic sections of the optic nerve. In addition, immunochemical staining was negative throughout the retina and optic nerve. These results suggested that the rNAION-induced NFL swelling was not a result of inflammation. In the chronic phase of rNAION, the morphologic retinal changes were apparent in only the retinal ganglion cell(RGC) layer, with a reduction in the number of cells in the RGC layer. Thus, we need to evaluate the degree of the NFL swelling in the acute phase and the following thinning of the NFL in the chronic phase for efficacy of the treatment of rNAION. Therefore, we used optical coherence tomography (OCT) for the objective and quantitative evaluation of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness around the optic disc changes in rNAION. The second method was to use the STR for the evaluation of the RGC function. The third method was to count the number of surviving RGCs observed and photographed through the fluorescence microscope with the Fluorogold staining. A possible rationale for treatment of NAION is that dilation of the posterior ciliary artery (PCA) increases the blood flow to the optic nerve and could improve the optic nerve function. To clarify the vasodilatory effects of medications, we used in vitro isometric tension recording methods and examined the vasodilatory effects of bevacizumab as an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, methylprednisolone as a corticosteroid and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a nitric oxide donor) as a vasodilator on high-K (potassium) solution-induced contraction in isolated rabbit PCA. Bevacizumab did not relax rabbit PCA. Methylprednisolone relaxed rabbit PCA nitric oxide (NO) independently. SNP relaxed rabbit PCA by exogenous NO. On the basis of these results, we selected the following candidates for rNAION treatment: methylprednisolone as the corticosteroid and L-arginine as the NO related agent. Intravenous infusion of methylprednisolone significantly decreased the degree of acute disc edema but did not reduce inner retinal thinning, decrease STR amplitude, or decrease RGC numbers in rNAION. Intravenous infusion of L-arginine after rNAION induction significantly decreased the disc edema at the acute stage and the thinning of the inner retina, reduced the decrease in STR amplitude, and reduced the decrease in RGC numbers during rNAION. These results indicated that L-arginine treatment is effective for reducing the anatomical changes and improving visual function in the acute stage of rNAION. To strengthen the neuroprotective effect for rNAION, we tried treatment using transcorneal electric stimulation (TES). We evaluated the effect using STR and survival RGCs. Decreased amplitude in the STR of the TES group was significantly better preserved than in the control group on the 28th day after treatment. RGC survival in the TES group was significantly larger than in the control group on the 14th and 28th days. The neuroprotective effect of TES was better than that of L-arginine. For preventive treatment of subsequent attack in the fellow eye, we investigated whether pretreatment with L-arginine might reduce the severity of the anatomical changes associated with NAION and preserve the visual function when NAION occurs in the other eye. In the L-arginine pretreated eyes, the disc edema at the acute stage and the thinning of inner retina were significantly decreased, and the decrease of STR amplitude and the decrease in RGC numbers during rNAION were reserved. These results indicate that pretreatment with L-arginine is effective for the reduction of the severity during recurrence in the other eye. We will perform clinical trials in a small series of cases, and if the treatment is effective, we will proceed to multicenter randomized treatment trials. In addition to that, more work needs to be done to discover better treatment options for NAION."

CD008803,0,22014499,0,[Clinical forms of macular glaucoma using optical coherence tomography].,"Glaucomatous damage of the macular area is varied: it can be sector-based or diffused, possibly with peripheral damage. The author has developed an original manual method for mapping the retinal ganglion layer as well as a 1200μm circular section around the fovea, using a Topcon 3D OCT 1000, which reveals the glaucomatous structural damage of the macula. Several examples show that the most reliable tool for early examination of the condition of the macula is the OCT of the ganglion cell complex at the perifoveolar raised edge. It is much more reliable than the papillary OCT of optical fibers, which does not give significant information on macular damage, and visual field examination, which is often too late. The role of the ganglion cell complex OCT is specified: to confirm visual field defects, if they do exist, and more importantly, to anticipate them; to establish a specified relation between structure and function. Although OCT of the ganglion cell complex is useful in all cases to estimate the severity of glaucoma, this study shows that it has become essential in cases of isolated macular damage. This is the only examination that can detect this in a timely manner and prevent the appearance of a nonreversible juxtafoveolar scotoma and the risk of blindness."

Focal photocoagulation was dangerous and the least effective technique in preventing recurrence of neovascularization. Feeder-frond photocoagulation was effective initially, but was associated with a high incidence of recurrent neovascularization. Panretinal photocoagulation and panretinal photocoagulation combined with feeder-frond treatment produced results superior to those obtained with the two earlier techniques. The best results were obtained with combined feeder-frond and panretinal photocoagulation done concurrently. Early diagnosis, aggressive photocoagulation therapy, and close follow-up were essential in order to obtain good results."

A total of 80 subjects, including 40 CM patients (24 females, 16 males, [corrected] at 19-36 years of age) with no migraine prophylactic treatment and 40 healthy controls (22 females, 18 males, [corrected] at 20-40 years of age) were enrolled. Both eyes of patients with CM and controls were imaged using Cirrus HD SD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA). The average RNFL thickness was not significantly thinner in patients with CM. The mean average RNFL thickness was 83 ± 10.5 μm in CM patients and 85 ± 9.6 μm in healthy controls (p = 0.648), but superior quadrant RNFL thickness in the CM patients was significantly lower than healthy controls. The mean superior RNFL thickness was 86 ± 6.7 μm in CM patients and 108 ± 7.3 μm in controls (p < 0.001). Illness duration and frequency of the attacks were not affected by RNFL thickness. No significant differences were detected in macular changes between CM patients and healthy controls. In our study, the thickness of superior RNFL was found to be thinner in CM patients. This implies that longitudinal follow-up is needed to clarify whether RNFL thinning, in migraine patients, is related to a progressive loss of axons and retinal ganglion cells."

CD008803,0,24709053,0,A unified framework for glaucoma progression detection using Heidelberg Retina Tomograph images.,"Glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, is an optic neuropathy characterized by distinctive changes in the optic nerve head (ONH) and visual field. The detection of glaucomatous progression is one of the most important and most challenging aspects of primary open angle glaucoma (OAG) management. In this context, ocular imaging equipment is increasingly sophisticated, providing quantitative tools to measure structural changes in ONH topography, an essential element in determining whether the disease is getting worse. In particular, the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT), a confocal scanning laser technology, has been commonly used to detect glaucoma and monitor its progression. In this paper, we present a new framework for detection of glaucomatous progression using HRT images. In contrast to previous works that do not integrate a priori knowledge available in the images, particularly the spatial pixel dependency in the change detection map, the Markov Random Field is proposed to handle such dependency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the Variational Expectation Maximization (VEM) algorithm for inferring topographic ONH changes in the glaucoma progression detection framework. Diagnostic performance of the proposed framework is compared to recently proposed methods of progression detection."

Patients with peripheral retinitis and other areas of retinitis were excluded. All patients were treated with ganciclovir. Two distinct types of cytomegalovirus infection of the peripapillary area were identified. Type I was characterized by spread of limited retinitis to the optic disk margin, good central visual acuity, and permanent arcuate and altitudinal visual field defects that enlarged and became more complete as the retinitis progressed toward the disk. Type II appeared to be a true cytomegalovirus infection of the optic nerve characterized by primary, isolated papillitis with peripapillary retinitis, an early afferent pupillary defect, and good initial visual acuity, which rapidly deteriorated despite prompt antiviral therapy. Peripapillary cytomegalovirus retinitis appears to be an important and underreported cause of visual morbidity in patients with AIDS."

Thirty-seven primary open-angle glaucoma patients were divided into two groups depending on the patients having been treated or not. The statistical results showed that there were significant differences between the treated and untreated groups' SC areas (treated, 7935.6875±680.003 μm(2); untreated, 3890.71875±871.49844 μm(2); P<0.001), the circumferences (treated, 580.37891±44.96529 μm; untreated, 381.9026±41.22123 μm; P<0.001), and the long diameters (treated, 272.87806±25.7254 μm; untreated, 185.24047±19.72786 μm; P<0.001).

CD008803,0,23179813,0,[Influence of dry eye syndrome on glaucoma diagnostic procedures].,"Approximately 50-60% of primary open angle glaucoma patients suffer from dry eye and ocular surface disease and have a reduced corneal thickness. The measurements by imaging procedures are weakened by signal noise and perimetry procedures are affected by generalized loss of sensitivity. In dry eye patients, possible influences on new perimetry procedures, such as frequency doubling technology (FDT), flicker-defined form (FDF) perimetry and pulsar perimetry (PP) potentially result from stray light and reduced contrast sensitivity. In glaucoma patients with ocular surface disturbances, measuring procedures with high sensitivity and low specificity should be carefully checked for plausibility by the examiner. Using these procedures uncritically involves the danger of over interpretation in terms of non-existent glaucoma progression. If necessary, eyes should be pretreated with lubricating eye drops or therapy should be switched to preservative-free pressure lowering drops. Afterwards, new control measurements should be taken to exclude glaucoma pseudoprogression."

CD008803,0,21722662,0,Imaging retinal nerve fiber bundles using optical coherence tomography with adaptive optics.,"Early detection of axonal tissue loss in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) is critical for effective treatment and management of diseases such as glaucoma. This study aims to evaluate the capability of ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence tomography with adaptive optics (UHR-AO-OCT) for imaging the RNFL axonal bundles (RNFBs) with 3×3×3μm(3) resolution in the eye. We used a research-grade UHR-AO-OCT system to acquire 3°×3° volumes in four normal subjects and one subject with an arcuate retinal nerve fiber layer defect (n=5; 29-62years). Cross section (B-scans) and en face (C-scan) slices extracted from the volumes were used to assess visibility and size distribution of individual RNFBs. In one subject, we reimaged the same RNFBs twice over a 7month interval and compared bundle width and thickness between the two imaging sessions. Lastly we compared images of an arcuate RNFL defect acquired with UHR-AO-OCT and commercial OCT (Heidelberg Spectralis). Individual RNFBs were distinguishable in all subjects at 3° retinal eccentricity in both cross-sectional and en face views (width: 30-50μm, thickness: 10-15μm). At 6° retinal eccentricity, RNFBs were distinguishable in three of the five subjects in both views (width: 30-45μm, thickness: 20-40μm). Width and thickness RNFB measurements taken 7months apart were strongly correlated (p<0.0005). Mean difference and standard deviation of the differences between the two measurement sessions were -0.1±4.0μm (width) and 0.3±1.5μm (thickness). UHR-AO-OCT outperformed commercial OCT in terms of clarity of the microscopic retina. To our knowledge, these are the first measurements of RNFB cross section reported in the living human eye."
CD008803,0,4088615,0,Quantitation of optic disc cupping.,"In population-based studies and in clinical practice a reliable, objective measure of optic disc cupping is needed. This measure is of special importance when following patients with diagnosed or suspected glaucoma. We have developed a new system using stereoscopic fundus photographs for quantitating optic disc cupping from these photographs. Measurements of the cup are based on cup contour. For this system, measurements of longest and shortest cup and longest and shortest disc diameters by two observers were highly correlated, with correlation coefficients of 0.88, 0.88, 0.77, and 0.82, respectively. Mean cup to disc ratios for long and short disc diameters were within 0.04 (n = 330) between the two observers. The measurements show a high degree of inter- and intra-observer reliability, and are inexpensive in time and materials to perform. This method is well suited to population-based studies."

CD008803,0,7679270,0,Different determinants of neovascularization on the optic disc and on the retina in patients with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.,"Almost all patients with type I and many with type II diabetes develop proliferative retinopathy. This entity consists of two components: new blood vessels on the optic disc (NVD), which frequently lead to visual loss, and new blood vessels elsewhere on the retina (NVE), which do not pose such a serious threat to vision. This study examined determinants of neovascularization specifically on the optic disc in eyes with severe nonproliferative retinopathy. The study eyes were under surveillance as the untreated control eyes of participants in the Diabetic Retinopathy Study. During the 5-year follow-up period, NVE developed in almost all of the eyes, whereas the cumulative incidence of NVD in these same eyes was 64% and varied according to several factors. The risk of NVD in a study eye was increased if the contralateral treated eye had NVD rather than NVE or severe nonproliferative retinopathy (odds ratio [OR], 6.1; P < .0001). It was also increased if the study eye had, at the baseline examination, soft exudates and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (OR, 5.7; P = .002) or soft exudates alone (OR, 4.0; P = .04). Nephropathy and poor glycemic control were each associated with a two-fold increase in risk but neither was statistically significant. Eyes of individuals over 40 years of age were protected from the development of NVD (OR, 0.5; P < .05). The findings of this study support the hypothesis that, in patients with diabetes, the development of NVD is determined by different factors than the development of NVE."

The sensitivity of NFL atrophy to glaucoma was high: in POAG eyes with field loss, 88.9% (64/72) had NFL atrophy. In 123 normal eyes, NFL atrophy was found in only one eye, the specificity of NFL atrophy being 99.2%. All LTG patients and suspects of LTG had NFL atrophy. In the fellow eyes of POAG with normal fields and eyes of POAG suspects, NFL defects occurred in 53.8% (7/13) and 20.6% (15/73) respectively. The examination of NFL is a simple procedure; the nerve fibers themselves are directly observed rather than their function. When half of the thickness of NFL is lost, it Will be manifested clinically. With its high sensitivity and specificity, NFL atrophy can be regarded as an important indicator in the diagnosis of glaucoma."

CD008803,0,21819259,0,Breast cancer medications and vision: effects of treatments for early-stage disease.,"This review concerns the effects on vision and the eye of medications prescribed at three phases of treatment for women with early-stage breast cancer (BC): (1) adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy, (2) adjuvant endocrine therapy, and (3) symptomatic relief. The most common side effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy are epiphora and ocular surface irritation, which can be caused by any of several different regimens. Most notably, the taxane docetaxel can lead to epiphora by inducing canalicular stenosis. The selective-estrogen-receptor-modulator (SERM) tamoxifen, long the gold-standard adjuvant-endocrine-therapy for women with hormone-receptor-positive BC, increases the risk of posterior subcapsular cataract. Tamoxifen also affects the optic nerve head more often than previously thought, apparently by causing subclinical swelling within the first 2 years of use for women older than ~50 years. Tamoxifen retinopathy is rare, but it can cause foveal cystoid spaces that are revealed with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and that may increase the risk for macular holes. Tamoxifen often alters the perceived color of flashed lights detected via short-wavelength-sensitive (SWS) cone response isolated psychophysically; these altered perceptions may reflect a neural-response sluggishness that becomes evident at ~2 years of use. The aromatase inhibitor (AI) anastrozole affects perception similarly, but in an age-dependent manner suggesting that the change of estrogen activity towards lower levels is more important than the low estrogen activity itself. Based on analysis of OCT retinal thickness data, it is likely that anastrozole increases the tractional force between the vitreous and retina. Consequently, AI users, myopic AI users particularly, might be at increased risk for traction-related vision loss. Because bisphosphonates are sometimes prescribed to redress AI-induced bone loss, clinicians should be aware of their potential to cause scleritis and uveitis occasionally. We conclude by suggesting some avenues for future research into the visual and ocular effects of AIs, particularly as relates to assessment of cognitive function."
CD008803,0,9604104,0,Microperimetry of localized retinal nerve fiber layer defects.,"The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity of retinal areas involved in a localized retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defect and to assess correlations between microperimetry and the standard full threshold central 30 deg visual field test. Twenty-five patients with focal RNFL defects, evaluated by means of Argon-blue scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), underwent an automated 30 deg central visual field examination and a microperimetry with SLO. Microperimetry was performed according to standard procedures (infrared laser for fundus imaging; HeNe laser for 10 candles/m2 background illumination, fixation aid and generation of stimuli; manual fundus tracking). The size of stimuli was Goldmann III with 0.1 sec duration. In eyes with focal RNFL defects a deep microperimetric scotoma of at least 5 dB was found in 12 cases and a mild scotoma (1-4 dB) in 13 cases. These scotomas were mainly located throughout the whole defect or grouped in the temporal or nasal sides of the defect and were characterized by sharp and well-defined borders. With automated perimetry, a scotoma, defined by a single point depression of at least 10 dB or a depression of at least 5 dB in two or more contiguous points corresponding to the RNFL, defect, was found in only 14 out of 25 eyes with microperimetric defect. Focal RNFL defects correspond to localized areas of depressed retinal sensitivity as evaluated by microperimetry. The close correspondence between structural and microperimetric findings suggests that, in hypertensive eyes also, localized RNFL defects correspond to visual dysfunction possibly associated with substantial atrophy of ganglion cells."

Our retrospective study aims to analyze safety and efficacy of subconjunctival triamcinolone injections in the treatment of uveitic macular edema. We included 31 eyes of 30 patients, who had one or several injections. We studied the progression of visual acuity, central macular thickness by optical coherence tomography (OCT), intraocular pressure, and presence or absence of cataract, on the day of injection (T0), and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after injection. Twenty-one patients had only one injection; 10 patients had 2. The 12-month follow-up showed an improvement in visual acuity with an initial mean of 0.36 ± 0.27 logMAR to 0.23 ± 0.33 logMAR at 3 months of follow-up (P<0.0004), and to 0.24 ± 0.21 logMAR at 12 months (P=0.0371), for a two-line improvement. A decrease in mean central macular thickness was measured by OCT, from a mean of 444 ± 112 μm (0.24 ± 0.11 logSD-OCT) at T0 to 355 ± 103 μm (0.14 $ ± 0.10 logSD-OCT) at 3 months (P=0.0002). We did not find a significant increase in intraocular pressure, and we diagnosed one cataract during follow-up but this occurred in the uninjected eye as well. Subconjunctival injection of triamcinolone acetonide is a safe and effective treatment of macular edema related to uveitis. Initial clinical monitoring is necessary to detect iatrogenic events."

Its purpose is to compare the effectiveness of the various modes of screening which were used. All optometrists tested every patient by ophthalmoscopy. The 146 who, in addition, conducted tonometry on a routine basis detected a confirmed glaucoma in 0.35% of their patients, whilst the 43 who used tonometry 'on suspicion' detected a case in 0.25%, (P < 0.02). The 47 optometrists who conducted perimetry frequently (i.e. in > or = 15% of sight tests) detected a case in 0.46% of patients, whilst the other 142, who did little or no perimetry, detected a case in 0.29%, (P < 0.001). Eleven optometrists who relied mainly on ophthalmoscopy had a detection rate of only 0.12%. Optometrists with the most comprehensive modes of screening had the greatest referral accuracy. It was concluded that more widespread adoption of routine tonometry for people aged approximately greater than 40 years is necessary to reduce the present substantial number of false negatives; and that the frequent use of visual field analysis is additionally required to achieve the best results."

CD008803,0,20703048,0,Postsurgical cystoid macular edema.,"Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a primary cause of reduced vision following both cataract and successful vitreoretinal surgery. The incidence of clinical CME following modern cataract surgery is 0.1-2.35%. Preexisting conditions such as diabetes mellitus and uveitis as well as intraoperative complications can raise the risk of developing CME postoperatively. The etiology of CME is not completely understood. Prolapsed or incarcerated vitreous and postoperative inflammatory processes have been proposed as causative agents. Pseudophakic CME is characterized by poor postoperative visual acuity. Fluorescein angiography is indispensable in the workup of CME, showing the classical perifoveal petaloid staining pattern and late leakage of the optic disk. Optical coherence tomography is a useful diagnostic tool, which displays cystic spaces in the outer nuclear layer. The most important differential diagnoses include age-related macular degeneration and other causes of CME such as diabetic macular edema. Most cases of pseudophakic CME resolve spontaneously. The value of prophylactic treatment is doubtful. First-line treatment of postsurgical CME should include topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be considered complementary. In cases of resistant CME, periocular or intraocular corticosteroids present an option. Antiangiogenic agents, though experimental, should be considered for nonresponsive persistent CME. Surgical options should be reserved for special indications."

Retinal wholemounts were prepared from subjects with a primary clinicopathological diagnosis of PD (N=9), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; N=3), Alzheimer's disease (N=3), progressive supranuclear palsy (N=2) as well as elderly normal control subjects (N=4). These were immunohistochemically stained with an antibody against α-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129, which is a specific molecular marker of synucleinopathy. Phosphorylated α-synuclein-immunoreactive (p-syn IR) nerve fibers were present in 7/9 PD subjects and in 1/3 DLB subjects; these were sparsely distributed and superficially located near or at the inner retinal surface. The fibers were either long and straight or branching, often with multiple en-passant varicosities along their length. The straight fibers most often had an orientation that was radial with respect to the optic disk. Together, these features are suggestive of either retinopetal/centrifugal fibers or of ganglion cell axons. In one PD subject there were sparse p-syn IR neuronal cell bodies with dendritic morphology suggestive of G19 retinal ganglion cells or intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells. There were no stained nerve fibers or other specific staining in any of the non-PD or non-DLB subjects. It is possible that at least some of the observed visual function impairments in PD subjects might be due to α-synucleinopathy."

CD008803,0,17158086,0,Recent developments in optical coherence tomography for imaging the retina.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was introduced in ophthalmology a decade ago. Within a few years in vivo imaging of the healthy retina and optic nerve head and of retinal diseases was a fact. In particular the ease with which these images can be acquired considerably changed the diagnostic strategy used by ophthalmologists. The OCT technique currently available in clinical practice is referred to as time-domain OCT, because the depth information of the retina is acquired as a sequence of samples, over time. This can be done either in longitudinal cross-sections perpendicular to, or in the coronal plane parallel to the retinal surface. Only recently, major advances have been made as to image resolution with the introduction of ultrahigh resolution OCT and in imaging speed, signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity with the introduction of spectral-domain OCT. Functional OCT is the next frontier in OCT imaging. For example, polarization-sensitive OCT uses the birefringent characteristics of the retinal nerve fibre layer to better assess its thickness. Blood flow information from retinal vessels as well as the oxygenation state of retinal tissue can be extracted from the OCT signal. Very promising are the developments in contrast-enhanced molecular optical imaging, for example with the use of scattering tuneable nanoparticles targeted at specific tissue or cell structures. This review will provide an overview of these most recent developments in the field of OCT imaging focussing on applications for the retina."

Although both medications increased intraocular pressure, endpoint substitution analysis demonstrated that mean intraocular pressure increases from baseline in the eyes treated with fluorometholone were significantly lower than those in the eyes treated with dexamethasone at weeks 2, 4, and 6 (P less than or equal to .05). Also, mean maximum intraocular pressure was significantly lower in the eyes treated with fluorometholone than in the eyes treated with dexamethasone (P = .001).

Impaired blood flow may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. We present data concerning juxtapapillary retinal and optic nerve-head blood flow during acute increases in IOP. With the combination of a laser Doppler flowmeter and a scanning-laser system (Scanning Laser Doppler Flowmeter, SLDF; Heidelberg Engineering) the perfusion of the retina and the optic nerve head was quantified and visualized. Juxtapapillary retinal and optic nerve-head blood flow was measured simultaneously by SLDF during variations in IOP induced by a suction cup in nine healthy volunteers. The ocular pressure was increased for 2 min to IOP +15 mmHg, then to IOP +30 mmHg, and finally, to IOP +45 mmHg. Ocular perfusion pressure (PP) was calculated as the mean arterial blood pressure minus the IOP. The declines in juxtapapillary retinal flow as expressed in present per 10-mmHg IOP elevation ranged from 3.6% to 14.1% (median 7.4%). Over all measurements we found a significant linear relationship between juxtapapillary retinal blood flow and PP (r = 0.55, P < 0.0001). The observed decrease in optic nerve-head blood flow with increasing IOP was significantly greater as compared with the retinal blood flow decrease (8.4%/10 mmHg versus 7.4%/10 mmHg, P < 0.05). SLDF enables the quantification and visualization of perfused capillaries of the retina and the optic nerve head in high resolution. Acute elevations of IOP led to a decreases in juxtapapillary retinal and optic nerve-head blood flow of 7.4% and 8.4%/ 10-mmHg IOP increase, respectively."

Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be unreliable in the presence of a myopic tilted disc. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the calculation circle location of spectral domain (SD)-OCT when measuring RNFL thickness in healthy subjects with myopic tilted disc. METHODS. Sixty-nine eyes with myopic tilted disc and no other ocular abnormalities were analyzed. In all eyes, RNFL thickness was measured twice: first, along a calculation circle determined by a built-in algorithm (referred to as circle 1) and then along a manually positioned calculation circle based on the contours of the neural canal opening (NCO) (referred to as circle 2). The mean number of clock hours below normal at the 5% level and the proportion of eyes with abnormally thin clock hours at the 5% level were compared between the two methods: RESULTS. The mean number of clock hours below normal at the 5% level was significantly lower in circle 2 (0.84 ± 1.31) than in circle 1 (1.42 ± 1.43; P < 0.05). The proportion of eyes with abnormally thin clock hours at the 5% level was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in circle 2 (42%) than in circle 1 (69.9%). CONCLUSIONS. In subjects with myopic tilted disc, RNFL thickness measurements along the calculation circle based on the contours of the NCO seem to be more comparable to the normative database of the SD-OCT than does the automatically determined scan position."

CD008803,0,21870889,0,Targeting progressive neuroaxonal injury: lessons from multiple sclerosis.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by progressive neuroaxonal injury, suggesting a common pathophysiological pathway. Identification and development of neuroprotective therapies for such diseases has proven a major challenge, particularly because of an already substantial neuroaxonal compromise at the time of initial onset of clinical symptoms. Methods for early identification of neurodegeneration are therefore vital to ensure that neuroprotective therapies are applied as early as possible. Recent investigations have enhanced our understanding of the role of neuroaxonal injury in multiple sclerosis (MS). As MS generally manifests earlier in life and can be diagnosed much earlier in the course of the disease than the above-mentioned 'classic' neurodegenerative diseases, it is possible that MS could be used as a model disease to study degeneration and regeneration of the CNS. The mechanism of neuroaxonal injury in MS is believed to be inflammation-led neurodegeneration; however, the reverse may also be true (i.e. neuroaxonal degeneration may precede inflammation). Animal models of PD, AD and ALS have shown that it is likely that most cases of disease are due to initial inflammation, followed by a degenerative process, providing a parallel between MS and the classic neurodegenerative diseases. Other common factors between MS and the neurodegenerative diseases include iron and mitochondrial dysregulation, abnormalities in α-synuclein and tau protein, and a number of immune mediators. Conventional MRI techniques, using markers such as T2-weighted lesions, gadolinium-enhancing lesions and T1-weighted hypointensities, are readily available and routinely used in clinical practice; however, the utility of these MRI measures to predict disease progression in MS is limited. More recently, MRI techniques that provide more pathology-specific data have been applied in MS studies, including magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetization transfer ratio and myelin water imaging. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-MRI technique that quantifies optic nerve integrity and retinal ganglion cell loss as markers of neuroaxonal injury; more research is needed to evaluate whether information obtained from OCT is a reliable marker of axonal injury and long-term disability in MS. Using these advanced techniques, it may become possible to follow degeneration and regeneration longitudinally in patients with MS and to better differentiate the effects of drugs under investigation. Currently available immune-directed therapies that are approved by the US FDA for the first-line treatment of MS (interferon-β and glatiramer acetate) have been shown to decelerate the inflammatory process in MS; however, such therapy is less effective in preventing the progression of the disease and neuroaxonal injury. The use of MS as a clinical model to study modulation of neuroaxonal injury in the brain could have direct implications for the development of treatment strategies in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, PD and ALS."

CD008803,0,23837222,0,Comparison of reliability of the eye optic disc cup and pallor areas in glaucoma diagnostics.,The aim of this paper is to compare the glaucoma diagnostic reliability of two optic disc parameters: the relative cup area size determined by the Heidelberg retina tomography and the relative pallor area size determined by the proposed algorithm of the optic disc image analysis. Both parameters were measured for 240 normal healthy eyes and 240 glaucomatous eyes. The diagnostic reliability of studied parameters were compared using normalized distance d of their statistical distributions obtained for normal healthy and glaucomatous eyes and by comparison of area sizes under their ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves. The normalized distances were 2.19 or 1.73 and the area sizes under ROC curves were 0.95 or 0.89 for relative cup or pallor area size. Both considered relative parameters are significantly influenced by the glaucoma and can be used in its diagnostics. The designed pallor analysis is less diagnostic reliable than the analysis of the cup.

Main task was the study of damage of vision in children due to prolonged sun exposure. Examination were conducted on a three locations, with the assumption of varying insolation: Island of Rab, Novi Vinodolski and Delnice. The study included children aged between 9 to 14 years. The study included 189 children. Except routine ophthalmologic examinations in addition were preformed biomicroscopic examination of the anterior segment of the eye, intraocular pressure and eye fundus. In a certain number of children with suspect of a specific disease (macular degeneration, glaucoma and refractive error), additional tests were performed: glaucoma treatment, field of vision, optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the eye and detailed eye refraction. This study specifically addressed of refractive error at that three different regions. It was found that the most difficult situation was at the Novi Vinodolski where as many as 40% of children have a refractive error, followed by Island of Rab with 17% and Delnice with 9%. Especially like to mention that on the island of Rab, 50-60 years ago, it was a very rare occurrence of some refractive errors in children."

A total of 80 subjects, including 40 patients with early untreated AD (mean age, 69.3 ± 4.9 years) and 40 healthy controls (mean age, 68.9 ± 5.1 years) were enrolled. Both eyes of patients with AD and controls were imaged using SD-OCT. The average RNFL thickness was significantly less in the AD patients than in controls (65 ± 6.2 μm vs 75 ± 3.8μm; P = 0.001). There was selective thinning of the RNFL in the superior quadrant, the mean superior quadrant RNFL thickness being 76 ± 6.7 μm in AD patients and 105 ± 4.8 μm in controls (P = 0.001). In our study, the thickness of RNFL in patient with AD was lower than that of controls.

CD008803,0,24343442,0,Two-dimensional segmentation of the retinal vascular network from optical coherence tomography.,"The automatic segmentation of the retinal vascular network from ocular fundus images has been performed by several research groups. Although different approaches have been proposed for traditional imaging modalities, only a few have addressed this problem for optical coherence tomography (OCT). Furthermore, these approaches were focused on the optic nerve head region. Compared to color fundus photography and fluorescein angiography, two-dimensional ocular fundus reference images computed from three-dimensional OCT data present additional problems related to system lateral resolution, image contrast, and noise. Specifically, the combination of system lateral resolution and vessel diameter in the macular region renders the process particularly complex, which might partly explain the focus on the optic disc region. In this report, we describe a set of features computed from standard OCT data of the human macula that are used by a supervised-learning process (support vector machines) to automatically segment the vascular network. For a set of macular OCT scans of healthy subjects and diabetic patients, the proposed method achieves 98% accuracy, 99% specificity, and 83% sensitivity. This method was also tested on OCT data of the optic nerve head region achieving similar results."

The evaluation of photographs of 163 normal optic nerve heads revealed a significant (p less than 0.001) correlation between the number of cilioretinal arteries and the optic disk and cup size: the larger the disk and cup the more vessels. The vessels' prevalence in all optic disks was 27.0%. It increased from 0% in disks smaller than 2.00 mm2 to 50.0% in optic nerve heads larger than 4.1 mm2. No correlations existed between cilioretinal arteries and refraction, axial length, side, sex and age, according to the missing correlations between these parameters and optic disk and cup area.

CD008803,0,21476312,0,[New diagnostic methods for imaging the anterior segment of the eye to enable treatment modalities selection].,"New diagnostic instruments for imaging the anterior segment of the eye have been developed using the corneal topographer, wavefront sensor, and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT). Data obtained from these instruments can be used to choose treatment modalities by providing information that is complementary to slit-lamp examination and visual acuity measurements. Zernike vector analysis was used to evaluate the corneal higher-order aberrations to quantify the effects of the corneal shape on the optical quality of the eye. The analyses showed the optical characteristics of the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cornea in patients with keratoconus or pellucid marginal corneal degeneration. The association between the deterioration of optical quality during rigid gas-permeable contact lens wear in patients with keratoconus and the residual coma due to posterior corneal shape was suggested by the findings made with this method. Zernike vector analyses also revealed the differences in the ocular higher-order aberrations between conventional Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and custom LASIK. Serial measurements of the ocular higher-order aberrations by a wavefront sensor enabled us to evaluate the effects of tear fluid dynamics on the optical quality of the eye. The findings clarified the characteristics of serial alterations of higher-order aberrations in normal eyes, dry eye with tear deficiency and dry eye with tear evaporation. The effects of internal lubricating agents on the soft contact lenses were also evaluated objectively. In addition, these results suggest that the effects of serial fluctuations in the ocular higher-order aberrations on refractive surgery should be considered. To observe the cornea at the cellular level with anterior segment OCT, a prototype machine of full-field OCT was developed. This made it possible to show epithelial edema in human donor corneas as well as the alterations in the epithelial layer and stromal layer associated with intraocular pressure elevation in ex vivo porcine eyes. An OCT-based corneal topographer was developed using a three-dimensional anterior segment OCT with the swept-source principle. Corneal topographic analyses of the anterior and posterior surfaces either in eyes with keratoconus or following keratoplasty was possible even in where it was difficult for conventional corneal topographers to analyze accurately. Also, OCT-based corneal topographer analyzed the host and donor cornea separately following Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty by recognizing the host-graft interface. The results from these new diagnostic methods for imaging the anterior segment of eye will be useful for the diagnosis of corneal disorders and the planning of treatment by evaluating the effects of corneal topographic abnormalities and tear fluid dynamics on visual function, by observing the abnormalities of the corneal tissue at the cellular level, and by showing corneal topography in diseased corneas more accurately and non-invasively."

This debate on whether such differences originate within the retina itself or are due to higher visual processing may be illuminated if concomitant anatomical, physiological, and psychophysical measures are taken in the same individuals. In the current study, we have focused on the study of objective functional and structural asymmetries at the retinal level and examined their putative correlation with visual performance asymmetries. Forty healthy participants (80 eyes; 13 male and 27 female subjects) were included in this study. Objective functional/structural asymmetries were probed using the multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) technique and optical coherence tomography (OCT), respectively. A nasal/temporal pattern of asymmetry (nasal visual hemifield disadvantage) was found for all methods (retinal thickness, contrast sensitivity, and mfERG P1 amplitude). Furthermore, superior/inferior asymmetries could be documented only with psychophysics and structural measures. These patterns likely arise at different levels of the retina as inferred by partly independent correlation patterns. We conclude that patterns of structural/functional asymmetries arise at different levels of visual processing with a strong retinal contribution."

Two presumptive methods for long-term follow-up were evaluated and compared, i.e. slit-lamp biomicroscopy enhanced by a 60 D lens and reading from two non-stereo photographs of the posterior pole. Two observers repeated their examinations with respective methods. Comparison of the methods with respect to detecting ability of the fibrovascular lesions showed no significant disagreement except in some eyes with fibrous tissue on the optic disc where new vessels were better detected with the slit-lamp method (P less than 0.001). There was no difference between the methods with respect to the intra- and inter-observer variability. Twenty to 30 patients could be diagnosed per hour with the photographic method compared to 5-6 patients with the slit-lamp.

CD008803,0,22334410,0,[Clinical value of scanning laser polarimetry in glaucoma diagnostics].,"The term glaucoma is used as a melting pot of many different diseases which have in common that the retinal ganglion cells and their axons are damaged. Untreated, apoptosis can be induced causing ganglion cell death which subsequently leads to typical glaucomatous damage at the optic nerve head, scotomas of the visual fields, and in the worst case scenario to blindness. It is well known that patients with glaucoma can suffer a 20 to 50 % loss of retinal ganglion cells before a defect becomes evident in standard white on white perimetry. To prevent glaucomatous damage, it is important to detect changes of the retinal ganglion cells and their nerve fibre layer as early as possible and to monitor their follow-up as closely as possible in order to find an adequate treatment of glaucoma, and to control its efficiency. In the past few years, scanning laser polarimetry by means of GDx technology (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, USA) could be established as a new method to measure the retinal nerve fibre layer not only qualitatively but even quantitatively. Presently, the GDx plays an important role in actual glaucoma diagnostics on account of its high resolution, the comfort for both patient and user, and its highly reproducible measurements. Especially in difficult evaluable optic nerve heads (e. g., micro- and macrodiscs), tilted discs, and optic disc anomalies (e. g., optic nerve drusen) modern nerve fibre diagnostics by means of GDx technology is a helpful enrichment in clinical routine."

This is mostly because only a small fraction of the 3D data is used in the current method of quantifying the structure of interest. This paper presents a novel SD-OCT data analysis technique, taking full advantage of the 3D dataset. The proposed algorithm uses machine classifier to analyze SD-OCT images after grouping adjacent pixels into super pixel in order to detect glaucomatous damage. A 3D SD-OCT image is first converted into a 2D feature map and partitioned into over a hundred super pixels. Machine classifier analysis using boosting algorithm is performed on super pixel features. One hundred and ninety-two 3D OCT images of the optic nerve head region were tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) was computed to evaluate the glaucoma discrimination performance of the algorithm and compare it to the commercial software output. The AUC of normal vs glaucoma suspect eyes using the proposed method was statistically significantly higher than the current method (0.855 and 0.707, respectively, p=0.031).

Eighty-four patients were enrolled into the study: 44 eyes of 24 patients with mild to moderate AD (Group 1), 68 eyes of 35 patients with glaucoma (Group 2), and 49 eyes of 25 heathy volunteers as a control (Group 3). A complete ophthalmologic examination as well as a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopic assessment with HRT III were performed on all patients. Mean values of the ONH topographic parameters such as rim area (RA), rim volume (RV), height variation contour, linear cup/disc ratio, cup shape measure, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) were recorded. Mean values of RNFL thickness was 0.23 ± 0.07 in AD, 0.22 ± 0.09 in glaucoma and 0.24 ± 0.07 in the control group (p = 0.323). RA and RV were significantly lower, and linear C/D ratio was significantly higher in the glaucoma group when compared to AD and control (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between AD and control for the optic disc parameters tested (p > 0.05). We observed a negative correlation of the age with RNFL in all of the groups (p < 0.005). Age was the most important parameter affecting RNFL.

The start of the molecular era of mitochondrial medicine, the year 1988, was marked by the identification of a maternally inherited form of optic atrophy, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, as the first disease due to mitochondrial DNA point mutations. The field of mitochondrial medicine has expanded enormously over the last two decades and many neurodegenerative diseases are now known to have a primary mitochondrial etiology or mitochondrial dysfunction plays a relevant role in their pathogenic mechanism. Recent technical advancements in neuro-ophthalmology, such as optical coherence tomography, prompted a still ongoing systematic re-investigation of retinal and optic nerve involvement in neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to inherited optic neuropathies, such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and dominant optic atrophy, and in addition to the syndromic mitochondrial encephalomyopathies or mitochondrial neurodegenerative disorders such as some spinocerebellar ataxias or familial spastic paraparesis and other disorders, we draw attention to the involvement of the optic nerve in classic age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson and Alzheimer disease. We here provide an overview of optic nerve pathology in these different clinical settings, and we review the possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of optic atrophy. This may be a model of general value for the field of neurodegeneration. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Mitochondrial function and dysfunction in neurodegeneration'."

To investigate the association between clinical measurements and glaucoma-specific quality of life in Chinese glaucoma patients. DESIGN. Cross-sectional study. SETTING. An academic hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS. A Chinese translation of the Glaucoma Quality of Life-15 questionnaire was completed by 51 consecutive patients with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma. The binocular means of several clinical measurements were correlated with Glaucoma Quality of Life-15 findings using Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression. The measurements were the visual field index and pattern standard deviation from the Humphrey Field Analyzer, Snellen best-corrected visual acuity, presenting intra-ocular pressure, current intra-ocular pressure, average retinal nerve fibre layer thickness via optical coherence tomography, and the number of topical anti-glaucoma medications being used. RESULTS. In these patients, there was a significant correlation and linear relationship between a poorer Glaucoma Quality of Life-15 score and a lower visual field index (r=0.3, r(2)=0.1, P=0.01) and visual acuity (r=0.3, r(2)=0.1, P=0.03). A thinner retinal nerve fibre layer also correlated with a poorer Glaucoma Quality of Life-15 score, but did not attain statistical significance (r=0.3, P=0.07). There were no statistically significant correlations for the other clinical parameters with the Glaucoma Quality of Life-15 scores (all P values being >0.7). The three most problematic activities affecting quality of life were ""adjusting to bright lights"", ""going from a light to a dark room or vice versa"", and ""seeing at night"". CONCLUSION. For Chinese primary open-angle glaucoma patients, binocular visual field index and visual acuity correlated linearly with glaucoma-specific quality of life, and activities involving dark adaptation were the most problematic."

PS-SS-OCT with continuous source polarization modulation is used to multiplex the incident states of polarization in the signal frequency of each A-scan. Although it offers the advantage of measurement speed that is as high as that of standard SS-OCT, its disadvantage is low axial measurement range. To overcome this drawback, we employed the B-M-mode scan (BM-scan) method, which removes complex conjugate ambiguity by applying phase modulation along the transversal scanning direction. Since polarization modulation and BM-scan are applied in different scanning directions, these methods can be combined to make the optimum use of both full range and polarization-sensitive imaging. Phase fluctuations that cause measurement failure were numerically canceled before demodulating the B-scan oriented modulation. After removing complex conjugate artifacts, the axial measurement range was 5.35 mm, and the signal-to-conjugate ratio was 40.5 dB. We demonstrated retinal imaging using the PS-SS-OCT system with a frequency-swept laser at a center wavelength of 1064 nm and an axial resolution of 11.4 microm in tissue.

The aim of this study was to define the presence and topographical distribution of brain grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) injury in LHON patients using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The correlation of such changes with neuro-ophthalmologic findings and measurements of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness by optical coherence tomography (OCT) was also assessed. Dual-echo and fast-field echo scans were acquired from 12 LHON patients and 12 matched controls. VBM analysis was performed using SPM5 and an ANCOVA model. A complete neuro-ophthalmologic examination, including standardized automated Humphrey perimetry as well as average and temporal peripapillary RNFL thickness measurements were obtained in all the patients. Compared with controls, average peripapillary RNFL thickness was significantly decreased in LHON patients. LHON patients also had significant reduced GM volume in the bilateral primary visual cortex, and reduced WM volume in the optic chiasm, optic tract, and several areas located in the optic radiations (OR), bilaterally. Visual cortex and OR atrophy were significantly correlated with average and temporal peripapillary RNFL thickness (P < 0.001; r values ranging from 0.76 to 0.89). Brain damage in patients with LHON is not limited to the anterior visual pathways, but extends posteriorly to the OR and the primary visual cortex. Such a damage to the posterior parts of the visual pathways may be due either to trans-synaptic degeneration secondary to neuroaxonal damage in the retina and optic nerve or to local mitochondrial dysfunction."

Automatic screening will help the doctors to quickly identify the condition of the patient in a more accurate way. The macular abnormalities caused due to diabetic retinopathy can be detected by applying morphological operations, filters and thresholds on the fundus images of the patient. Early detection of glaucoma is done by estimating the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness from the OCT images of the patient. The RNFL thickness estimation involves the use of active contours based deformable snake algorithm for segmentation of the anterior and posterior boundaries of the retinal nerve fiber layer. The algorithm was tested on a set of 89 fundus images of which 85 were found to have at least mild retinopathy and OCT images of 31 patients out of which 13 were found to be glaucomatous. The accuracy for optical disk detection is found to be 97.75%. The proposed system therefore is accurate, reliable and robust and can be realized."

CD008803,0,22568103,0,[A challenge to primary open-angle glaucoma including normal-pressure. Clinical problems and their scientific solution].,"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), including normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), is reported by the Tajimi Study to afflict 3.9% of the total population, and this represents about 80% of all total glaucoma cases which, in total, afflict 5.0% of the population. We tried to analyze the clinical problems relating to POAG by looking at the pathogenesis, intraocular pressure (IOP), therapy, neuroprotection and surgery of the disease. To elucidate the pathogenesis of glaucoma progression, we measured retinal nerve fiber layer defect (RNFLD) angles', and divided the NTG cases into 2 groups, enlarged RNFLD and stable RNFLD. Disc hemorrhages were found to be significantly more frequent in the enlarged group than in the stable group. RNFLD was enlarged in the direction of disc hemorrhage in over 80% of the eyes. In the majority of the eyes of the enlarged group, the enlargement of RNFLD was toward the fovea. The enlargement of RNFLD in NTG was closely associated with disc hemorrhage and the deterioration of the visual field. We developed a simultaneous structure and function evaluation technique combining spectral-domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus-oriented perimeters for the detection of visual field abnormalities in the RNFLD area. We superimposed the ganglion cell complex map obtained by SD-OCT on the fundus-oriented perimeter image. We observed very early or preperimetric normal pressure glaucoma as well as disc hemorrhage adjacent to the borders of the RNFLD. The borderline of the RNFLD seemed to be the thinnest RNFL and had the lowest retinal sensitivity (Active site for RNFLD progression). To clarify the role of the circadian clock genes in the generation of a 24-hour IOP rhythm, we used the microneedle method to measure the IOP at eight time points daily, both in wild type mice and Cry-deficient (Cry 1-/-Cry 2-/-) mice. In the wild-type mice living in light-dark conditions, the pressure measured in the light phase was significantly lower than in the dark phase. This biphasic daily rhythm was maintained under dark-dark conditions. In contrast, the Cry-deficient mice did not show significant circadian changes in their IOP, regardless of the environmental light conditions. These findings demonstrate that clock genes are essential for the generation of the circadian rhythm of IOP. We evaluated the relationship between the genetic polymorphisms of the adrenergic receptor (ADR) and the diurnal IOP in untreated NTG patients. For Del 301-303 in α2B-ADR, De1322-325 in α2C-ADR, and S 49G (A/G) in βl-ADR, the major homozygotes and minor carriers had parallel diurnal IOP curves, but significantly different diurnal IOP levels. Polymorphisms of the ADR gene may predict the diurnal IOP level of patients with NTG. Looking toward the future, tailor-made medicine in glaucoma therapy, we evaluated the relationship between the polymorphisms of the prostaglandin F2α, receptor (FP receptor) gene and the effectiveness of topical latanoprost treatment in 100 normal volunteers. One SNP(rs3753380) was located in the promoter region of the FP receptor gene and was significantly correlated with % IOP reduction. Two SNPs, rs3753380 and rs3766355 (an SNP in intron 1), were associated with the degree of response to latanoprost. The genotype of these SNPs may be an important determinant of variability in response to latanoprost. To investigate the predictability of IOP response of the fellow eye in a one-eye trials, we compared the correlation of the fellow-eye's IOP response in one-eye trials performed separately for each eye with that of bilateral treatment in 41 normal subjects. Correlation of mean diurnal IOP reduction between 2 one-eye trials was poor (r2 = 0.102), even after subtracting the nontreated eye IOP fluctuations from the treated eye IOPs (r2 = 0.097), but that between fellow eyes in bilateral treatment was excellent (r2 = 0.849). Therefore, we examined the effects of multiple IOP measurements on the correlation of response to glaucoma medication between fellow eyes. Latanoprost was applied to the first eye and then to both eyes of POAG or ocular hypertension patients. IOP measurements were performed twice on different days at baseline, during treatment of the first eye only and for both eyes. No significant correlations of ΔIOP 1 (IOP at baseline-IOP after treatment) between fellow eyes were found. ΔIOP 2 (ΔIOP 1-IOP fluctuation of the contralateral eye) was significantly correlated between the fellow eyes using two post-treatment IOP measurements. Using multiple IOP measurements may improve the prediction of a fellow eye's response to glaucoma medication in one-eye trials. We used a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) for in vivo imaging and counting of rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). RGC survival decreased gradually after crushing the optic nerve. RGC counts by SLO were comparable to those in retinal flat mounts. We developed OCT system for rat eyes. The mean retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknesses in the circumpapillary OCT scans were unchanged 1 week after crushing the optic nerve, but then decreased significantly and progressively after the second week. RNFL thicknesses in OCT images correlated significantly with thicknesses determined histologically. SLO and OCT will be useful for evaluating the effects of neuroprotective drugs. We developed a new glaucoma filtration surgery system using a thin honeycomb-patterned biodegradable film in rabbits. The film had a honeycomb-patterned surface that faced the subconjunctival Tenon tissue, while the other side was smooth. Postoperative IOPs of the film-treated eyes were significantly lower than those of the control eyes, but were not significantly different from those of the MMC-treated eyes. The thin honeycomb-patterned film that was attached to the inner bleb wall worked as an adhesion barrier in glaucoma filtration surgery in rabbits."

CD008803,0,25312906,0,Exact surface registration of retinal surfaces from 3-D optical coherence tomography images.,"Nonrigid registration of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is an important problem in studying eye diseases, evaluating the effect of pharmaceuticals in treating vision loss, and performing group-wise cross-sectional analysis. High dimensional nonrigid registration algorithms required for cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis are still being developed for accurate registration of OCT image volumes, with the speckle noise in images presenting a challenge for registration. Development of algorithms for segmentation of OCT images to generate surface models of retinal layers has advanced considerably and several algorithms are now available that can segment retinal OCT images into constituent retinal surfaces. Important morphometric measurements can be extracted if accurate surface registration algorithm for registering retinal surfaces onto corresponding template surfaces were available. In this paper, we present a novel method to perform multiple and simultaneous retinal surface registration, targeted to registering surfaces extracted from ocular volumetric OCT images. This enables a point-to-point correspondence (homology) between template and subject surfaces, allowing for a direct, vertex-wise comparison of morphometric measurements across subject groups. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to localize and analyze regional changes in choroidal and nerve fiber layer thickness among healthy and glaucomatous subjects, allowing for cross-sectional population wise analysis. We also demonstrate the method's ability to track longitudinal changes in optic nerve head morphometry, allowing for within-individual tracking of morphometric changes. This method can also, in the future, be used as a precursor to 3-D OCT image registration to better initialize nonrigid image registration algorithms closer to the desired solution."

CD008803,0,10163319,0,Polarimetry of the retinal nerve fiber layer.,"Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) examination is a useful tool in the diagnosis and follow-up of glaucoma. Because the clinical techniques to date have been subjective, there is a definitive need to develop instruments that are capable of making accurate and reproducible measurements of the RNFL. Introduction of new quantitative methods, such as confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography raises high expectations in clinical practice. In the Nerve Fiber Analyzer (Laser Diagnostic Technologies, San Diego, CA) the measurement technique is based on the assumption that the RNFL has birefringent properties. The change in the polarization state, called retardation, can be quantified by determining the phase shift between polarization of light returning from the eye with the known state of polarization of the illuminating laser beam. The retardation shows a typical double-hump pattern of the RNFL thickness around the optic disk.

Abnormal fetal blood flow in the presence of fetal growth retardation helps to distinguish true fetal growth impairment from small but normally grown infants. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of IUGR with abnormal fetal blood flow on retinal optic nerve morphology at 18 y of age. A prospective study was performed in 19 subjects with IUGR [abnormal fetal aortic blood flow velocity; median birth weight deviation of -31% (-22 to -42%; median (range)] and in 23 subjects with a normal birth weight for gestational age [normal fetal aortic blood flow velocity; median birth weight deviation of -2% (-10 to 22%)]. All subjects were previously examined concerning minor neurologic dysfunction (MND) at 7 y of age. The ocular fundus was examined by ophthalmoscopy, and the optic nerve morphology was evaluated by digital image analysis. Decrease in neuroretinal rim area at 18 y of age was associated with increasing negative birth weight deviation (r = 0.71, p < 0.0001). The subjects with severe MND at 7 y had a reduced neuroretinal rim area [median (range), 1.57 mm(2) (1.37-1.78 mm(2))] compared with those with less severe MND [1.94 mm(2) (1.33-2.71 mm(2))] and with those with normal neurologic function [2.18 mm(2) (1.75-2.70 mm(2)); p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001, respectively]. A decrease in neuroretinal rim area reflects either a reduction in axonal volume or a decrease in the number of axons in the optic nerve. It is yet unclear whether this finding represents neuronal changes within other cerebral regions in subjects with IUGR."

The strength of linear correlation between the stereometric parameters and visual thresholds was used to generate a correspondence map between the optic disc and the visual field. Rim/disc area ratio and cup/disc area ratio correlated with the visual thresholds at the highest number of points in the visual fields. Thresholds at superior hemifield locations correlated best with the rim/disc area ratio and cup/disc area ratio in the inferonasal sector and the ones in the inferior hemifield correlated best with the rim/disc area ratio and cup/disc area ratio in the superotemporal sector. Optic disc parameters correlated better with inferior field locations and non-edge points than superior field locations and edge points. The data indicate that rim/disc area ratio and cup/disc area ratio measurements on HRT II have a good correlation with visual field damage seen on automated visual fields."

Conventional MRI techniques are considered the best tools for assessing and monitoring lesion burden and inflammation but are limited in their ability to assess axonal loss. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a simple high-resolution technique that uses near infrared light to quantify the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), which contains only non-myelinated axons. RNFL thickness (RNFLT) was measured using OCT on thirty consecutive MS patients (60 eyes). Eighteen patients underwent quantitative MRI analysis including T1- and T2-lesion volumes (LV), normalized brain volume (NBV), normalized cortical, white and gray matter volumes (NCV, NWMV, and NGMV), and mean whole brain diffusivity (MD). There was a strong association between NBV and average RNFL thickness (p<0.001, partial rp=0.77). The T2-LV and NWMV were significantly associated with average RNFL thickness (p=0.002, partial rp= -0.76 and p=0.005, partial rp=0.68, respectively) and there were trends toward association with T1-LV (p=0.041) and NGMV (p=0.067).

A comparison of the OND calculated parameters obtained for 16 patients (31 eyes), both by the ""Rodenstock"" scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) and by HRT-II, revealed that the OND parameters calculation preformed by HRT-II was more informative, diversified and automated, which essentially cuts the procedure time. We examined, by HRT-II, a group of 31 patients (61 eyes), comprising patients with high pressure glaucoma (HPG), with suspected NPG and with moderate-pressure glaucoma (MPG) and a group of controls with moderate arterial hypertension. A comparison of OND areas' distributions of three groups (NPG group, MPG group and HPG group) showed that the majority of disks had an area ranging from 2.0 to 2.6 mm2 in the NPG, the same index ranged from 1.8 to 2.2 mm2 in the MPG group, and in the HPG group the disks were evenly distributed by area virtually in all ranks. The OND area was on the average less (2.13 mm2) in an impaired autoregulation versus the group without any symptoms of peripheral vasospasm (2.49 mm2). According to our findings, a higher OND size contributes to aggravating glaucoma at a lower intraocular pressure (IOP). It is noteworthy, that more pronounced changes are observed on the side with a bigger OND area in absence of any other risk factors, e.g. neuro-ophthalmic pathology or stenosis of the main cerebral arteries."

Other causes of ON (pathology of connective tissue, infections, tumors or ischemic diseases) are rather uncommon. We carried out a detailed neuroophthalmologic examination of 137 (274 eyes) patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) including 58 patients (74 eyes) with a previous history of ON. Acute clinical symptoms of ON were recorded in 42% of MS patients. Moreover, in 31% of ON patients, ON was the first and only symptom of MS. In other 56% of MS patients, a subclinical damage of the optic analyzer was recorded. The examination of the central vision fields with the help of standard static automated perimetry (""Humphrey""-24/2) showed the reduction of the light sensitivity threshold in 90% of MS cases and in 100% ON cases. The contrast sensitivity was considerably reduced in the whole frequency band, including high frequency, in MS patients with the previous history of ON and with MS lasting for over 5 years. The use of the Sloan low-contrast test revealed the sharp reduction in the identification of signs with the contrast level of 2,5% and 1,25% in all ON cases and in 70% MS cases without ON. In 82% of MS cases, the pattern visual evoked potentials (PVEP) revealed the increase in P100 latent period from 10 to 50 msec above the upper norm limit. A distortion of the shape of PVEP P100 complex of W-type and amplitude reduction were recorded in over 90% MS cases with the previous history of ON. The use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed that the average thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in MS was decreased compared to the control group (87 (76; 97) and 105 (99; 115) microns, respectively). Patients with the previous history of ON had the lowest RNFL thickness of 73 (65; 84) microns. Diffusion tensor imaging showed that the index of fractional anisotropy (FA DTI) was considerably reduced in the optical nerve area and tract. Its average value was equal to 570,0 (510; 615) versus 651,9 (610; 710) microns in the control group."

CD008803,0,24458320,0,Development of a prediction formula of Parkinson disease severity by optical coherence tomography.,"The aims of this study were to assess the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), to determine its correlation with disease severity, and to define a simple biomarker for predicting clinical severity. One hundred two eyes from 52 patients affected by PD were compared with 97 eyes from 50 age-comparable controls. In all patients, peripapillary RNFL thickness was measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). We used the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total score and measured responses in the on medication state. Eyes from patients with PD had a statistically significant decrease in average peripapillary RNFL thickness compared with control eyes (P < 0.001). This reduction was observed in every quadrant (inferior, superior, nasal [P < 0.001], and temporal [P = 0.017]) in patients with PD. Furthermore, a strong inverse correlation was found between the PD severity measured according to the UPDRS score and the average peripapillary RNFL thickness (r = -0.615; P < 0.001) and PD duration (r = -0.303; P = 0.002). From these results, we defined a regression equation that predicts the UPDRS score from the above-mentioned variables: UPDRS = 81.6 + 29.6 * log PD duration (years) - 0.6 * RFNL thickness (μm). We observed that, as the evolution and severity of PD progress, the peripapillary RNFL layer thickness, as evaluated by OCT, gradually diminishes. These results suggest that the average peripapillary RNFL thickness measured by OCT might be useful as a biomarker to detect the early onset and progression of PD."

CD008803,0,25451722,0,Retinal neurodegeneration on optical coherence tomography and cerebral atrophy.,"Neurodegeneration in dementia is mainly evaluated by assessing cerebral atrophy, while retinal neurodegeneration can be quantified in vivo using optical coherence tomography (OCT). We examined the association of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thinning with global and regional cerebral atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Malay participants aged 60-80 years from the Epidemiology of Dementia in Singapore Study underwent comprehensive examinations, including 3-Tesla cranial MRI. RNFL and GC-IPL thicknesses were obtained from spectral domain-OCT; and cerebral grey and white matter volumes were obtained from MRI scans using a validated segmentation tool. Linear regression models were constructed with adjustment for age and sex; and additionally for vascular risk factors and MRI markers including intracranial volume. 164 participants without glaucoma with gradable quality MRI and OCT scans were included for analysis. GC-IPL thinning was associated with reduction in total brain volume in the occipital (mean change in GC-IPL per standard deviation (SD) decrease in occipital lobe volume: -1.77 μm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.55 to 0.01 μm) and temporal lobes (mean change in GC-IPL per SD decrease in temporal lobe volume: -3.45 μm, 95%CI -5.40 to -1.49 μm) in multivariate adjusted models. In particular, GC-IPL thinning was primarily associated with grey matter volume, whereas no association was found with white matter changes. Retinal neuronal damage, as reflected by GC-IPL thinning, was independently associated with grey matter loss in the occipital and temporal lobes, suggesting that retinal OCT may provide insights for assessing neurodegeneration in the brain."

CD008803,0,11057872,0,Regulation of platelet aggregation and adenosine triphosphate release in vitro by 17beta-estradiol and medroxyprogesterone acetate in postmenopausal women.,"Clinical studies have suggested that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in postmenopausal women. Although progestins are commonly added to HRT preparations for uteroprotection, the perceived beneficial cardiovascular effects of HRT are thought to be mediated predominantly by the estrogen component. Platelets play a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease and, hence, it is possible that the cardiovascular effects of estrogens are mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of illicit platelet activation. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of sex steroids on adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release in vitro in postmenopausal women. In addition, the effects of antiestrogens 14-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT) and ICI 182780] and antiprogestins (RU 486 and ZK 98299) were also investigated. Preincubation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) with antiestrogens or antiprogestins did not alter subsequent platelet aggregation or ATP release in response to ADP. However, preincubation with 17beta-estradiol (E2) significantly inhibited ADP-mediated platelet aggregation by a mean (+/-SEM) of 37%+/-6% (p = 0.02) and ATP release by 82%+/-6% (p = 0.03), an effect that was reversed by the addition of ICI 182780 or 4-OHT but not RU 486 and ZK 98299. Although the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) also significantly inhibited platelet aggregation (by 28%+/-5%, p = 0.02) and ATP release (by 63%+/-9%, p = 0.02), this inhibition was not reversed by the addition of antiprogestins or antiestrogens. These data show that sex steroids can modulate platelet function in vitro. Furthermore, as platelets are devoid of nuclear components, these findings indicate that estrogens may regulate platelet function through binding to a non-nuclear receptor with ligand-binding properties similar or identical to the wild-type receptor. By contrast, MPA appears to exert its effect through a mechanism that does not involve binding to the ""classical"" progesterone receptor."

CD008803,0,21390066,0,Adaptive optics and the eye (super resolution OCT).,"The combination of adaptive optics (AO) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) was first reported 8 years ago and has undergone tremendous technological advances since then. The technical benefits of adding AO to OCT (increased lateral resolution, smaller speckle, and enhanced sensitivity) increase the imaging capability of OCT in ways that make it well suited for three-dimensional (3D) cellular imaging in the retina. Today, AO-OCT systems provide ultrahigh 3D resolution (3 × 3 × 3 μm³) and ultrahigh speed (up to an order of magnitude faster than commercial OCT). AO-OCT systems have been used to capture volume images of retinal structures, previously only visible with histology, and are being used for studying clinical conditions. Here, we present representative examples of cellular structures that can be visualized with AO-OCT. We overview three studies from our laboratory that used ultrahigh-resolution AO-OCT to measure the cross-sectional profiles of individual bundles in the retinal nerve fiber layer; the diameters of foveal capillaries that define the terminal rim of the foveal avascular zone; and the spacing and length of individual cone photoreceptor outer segments as close as 0.5° from the fovea center."

CD008803,0,19662420,0,[Glaucoma diagnosis and follow-up using the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph].,"The Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) is a glaucoma diagnosis system that provides fast, noninvasive topographic information about the optic nerve head, the neuroretinal rim, and the thickness of the nerve fiber layer. With these capabilities, it is one of the leading laser systems for detecting glaucoma. Statistical methods such as the Moorfields regression analysis and the glaucoma probability score, as well as discriminant functions implemented in the instrument, support the clinician in discriminating between glaucoma and healthy eyes. The primary method for assessing glaucomatous change using the HRT is topographic change analysis, a technique that compares the variability within a baseline examination to that between baseline and follow-up examinations. The stereometric trend analysis reports changes in normalized topographic parameters over time. Furthermore, the flicker comparison enables the detection of small topographic changes over time.

The Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) with enhanced resolution has new options to detect glaucoma changes. This new technology is referred as frequency domain or spectral domain OCT. This paper will present current and new options of OCT in glaucoma diagnostics. Measurements of the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness using this new technology have been shown to be reproducible. Devices which use TD-OCT (e.g. Stratus-OCT) have a lower resolution than devices that use FD-OCT (e.g. RTVue-100; 10 microm versus 5 microm axial resolution). A new option is the evaluation of the retinal ganglion cell complex. The measurement of the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer using FD-OCT are promising for glaucoma diagnostics.

Ophthalmologic screening visits in diabetics even without visual symptoms are necessary to ensure early treatment. Once visual function is impairmed, it is often irreversible. Ophthalmologic treatment is indicated when neovascularizations develop, carrying the risk of vitreous hemorrhage and tractive retinal detachment.

We evaluate techniques to minimize the above mentioned artefacts using an 800 nm optical coherence microscope.

CD008803,0,16136741,0,"[Optical coherence tomography, an important new tool in the investigation of the retina].","Optical coherence tomography, an important new tool in the investigation ofthe retina Recently optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been introduced into the field of ophthalmology to enhance visualization ofthe various retinal layers. OCT uses interference of near infra-red, low-coherent light reflected from the retina and from a reference mirror, to create transverse sections of the retina. The strength of the signal is a measure of the reflection of the retinal layer which is situated at the same distance from the light source as the mirror. Accurate placement ofthe mirror gives a transverse view of the retina with an axial resolution of 10 microm, with which the resolution of a histological section can be approximated. OCT is used in ophthalmic diseases such as macular oedema, macular holes and other abnormalities on the retinal-vitreous border, following photodynamic therapy and in treating glaucoma. OCT has been used to detect early glaucoma by measuring the thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer. OCT and fluorescence angiography complement one another as diagnostic methods but OCT is superior in the diagnosis of macular oedema and macular holes. OCT provides images of retinal pathology which can easily be interpreted by both ophthalmologists and patients."

Best-corrected visual acuity was significantly better either in the right eyes or in the left eyes with greater retinal thickness of all four quadrants of the macular area in the inner ring, encompassing 1-3 mm from the foveal center (P < 0.05, Spearman rank correlation test), and also with the presence of the IS/OS line at the fovea (P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon-Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test). Retinal average thickness in the posterior pole covering the 6 × 6 mm square area was positively correlated with peripapillary RNFL average thickness either in the right eyes or in the left eyes (P < 0.05). The average thickness of the peripapillary RNFL became significantly less with age (P < 0.05), but was not related with visual acuity. Macular retinal thickness and the presence of the IS/OS line, but not peripapillary RNFL thickness, could serve as objective signs for better visual acuity in retinitis pigmentosa. The macular retinal thickness might be used as an objective predictor to choose patients with retinitis pigmentosa who would be expected to gain vision after retinal prosthesis implantation."
CD008803,0,22237821,0,Rating papilloedema: an evaluation of the Frisén classification in idiopathic intracranial hypertension.,"The appearance of the optic disc is a key measure of disease status in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The Frisén classification describes stages of optic disc swelling (grades 0-5). It is the only classification of papilloedema, and is used internationally in clinical and research practice. Despite this, there has been very limited evaluation of the scale. We assessed the inter-rater reproducibility and ability to discriminate optic disc changes over time using the Frisén classification compared with a system of ranking papilloedema severity in patients with IIH. Paired disc photographs (before and after treatment) were obtained from 47 patients with IIH (25 acute and 22 chronic). Six neuro-ophthalmologists blinded to patient identity, clinical information and chronology of the photographs reviewed the discs and allocated a Frisén grade and ranked the paired discs in order of papilloedema severity (disc ranking). A total of 188 optic disc photographs were reviewed. All six reviewers agreed in only three comparisons (1.6%) when using the Frisén classification, compared with 42 comparisons (45.2%) when using disc ranking. The probability of agreement between any two reviewers was 36.1% for Frisén grade and 70.0% for disc ranking. Disc ranking had significantly greater sensitivity for finding differences in degree of disc oedema, identifying a difference in 75.3% of paired photographs compared to 53.2% detected using the Frisén classification (p < 0.001). This study demonstrated the limited reproducibility and discriminative ability of the Frisén classification in identifying changes in serial optic disc photographs in IIH. Simple optic disc ranking appears to be a more sensitive and reliable tool to monitor changes in optic disc appearance. The use of disc ranking in clinical practice and research studies is recommended to monitor alterations in optic disc appearance until alternative schemes, specific to IIH, have been developed."

CD008803,0,23837966,0,Intra-retinal layer segmentation of 3D optical coherence tomography using coarse grained diffusion map.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a powerful and noninvasive method for retinal imaging. In this paper, we introduce a fast segmentation method based on a new variant of spectral graph theory named diffusion maps. The research is performed on spectral domain (SD) OCT images depicting macular and optic nerve head appearance. The presented approach does not require edge-based image information in localizing most of boundaries and relies on regional image texture. Consequently, the proposed method demonstrates robustness in situations of low image contrast or poor layer-to-layer image gradients. Diffusion mapping applied to 2D and 3D OCT datasets is composed of two steps, one for partitioning the data into important and less important sections, and another one for localization of internal layers. In the first step, the pixels/voxels are grouped in rectangular/cubic sets to form a graph node. The weights of the graph are calculated based on geometric distances between pixels/voxels and differences of their mean intensity. The first diffusion map clusters the data into three parts, the second of which is the area of interest. The other two sections are eliminated from the remaining calculations. In the second step, the remaining area is subjected to another diffusion map assessment and the internal layers are localized based on their textural similarities. The proposed method was tested on 23 datasets from two patient groups (glaucoma and normals). The mean unsigned border positioning errors (mean ± SD) was 8.52 ± 3.13 and 7.56 ± 2.95 μm for the 2D and 3D methods, respectively."

CD008803,0,4086732,0,[Hypothesis on the pathogenesis of the papillary dysversion syndrome].,"The tilted disc syndrome is an ocular anomaly characterized by dysversion of the optic nerve head, congenital crescent, vessel anomalies, ectasia and depigmentation of the infero-nasal fundus. Its pathogenesis is not known, but there are many theories as to its origin. The most convincing one links the tilted disc syndrome to an anomalous closing of the embryonic fissure. However this hypothesis does not adequately explains the origin of all the anomalies found in the syndrome. In this paper a new theory is suggested. The ganglion cell fibres of the infero-nasal retina could be misdirected toward the orbit through an anomalous embryonic fissure. In this way the fibres could not reach their central connections and degenerate. The hypoplasia of the infero-nasal quadrant of the eye could originate from the anomalous closing of the embryonic fissure and from the atrophy of the ganglion fibres; the crescent from the lack of fibres in the inferior optic disc; the anomalous appearance of the optic nerve head and the retinal vessels from a shifting of the disc upward due to the imbalance between the ganglion cell fibres coming from the superior and inferior retina."

CD008803,0,22661609,0,Local flicker stimulation evokes local retinal blood velocity changes.,"We investigated the effect of localized visual stimulation on human retinal blood velocity using an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO). To measure the blood velocity response, the AOSLO scanning raster was moved over the target arteries and red blood cell velocity was measured. Localized visual stimuli were delivered by projecting flicker patterns inside or outside the target artery's downstream region. The blood velocity increased in the presence of a flicker stimulus in the downstream region but not when outside the downstream region. The blood velocity increased more with larger area of stimulation. This increase was significant even when the stimulus was smaller than 600 μm × 600 μm. These findings suggest that when the retina regulates its blood flow to metabolic demands, it regulates blood velocity in the vascular system selectively, according to activity of neurons within its field of influence."

CD008803,0,20675732,0,"Retinal optical coherence tomography: past, present and future perspectives.","Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has undergone substantial changes since its first use in the 1990s. Although the first generation of OCT systems heralded a new era in the non-invasive diagnostic options in ophthalmology, they did not reveal much detail. Later devices offered more information and helped in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of pathological conditions, primarily of the retina. With today's spectral-domain type models ophthalmologists are offered a comprehensive tool with the opportunity for early diagnosis and precise monitoring of patients with retinal and glaucomatous pathologies. However, as experience with these new devices grows and demands by clinicians and researchers rise, further improvements need to be addressed. Future developments in the improvement of the transverse resolution and extension of the penetration depth are to be expected. New modalities such as polarisation sensitive OCT (PS-OCT) or Doppler OCT are now in use and promise additional insights in the properties of physiological and pathological tissue. While PS-OCT reveals further detail in alterations of the retinal pigment epithelium, Doppler OCT gives additional information about blood flow measurements. With these and further new developments, OCT will continue to be an invaluable instrument in the armamentarium of modern ophthalmology."

A clinical photopapillometric study.","In order to clinically evaluate the optical performance of the crystalline lens as well as that of intraocular implant lenses, measurements were made of the brightness of two markedly different and easily sited landmarks on the retina (the papilla and the macula) using the photopapillometer. The contrast transfer ratio (CTR) thus generated permitted investigation of three groups of subjects: Normal persons (n = 53) with visual acuity of 1.0 (20/20) from each mature decade of life provided values indicating the age-related changes in eyes not necessarily tending toward lens opacification. Relatively constant CTR values (approximately 2:1) were observed up to 60 years, after which the ratio fell significantly to about 1.5:1 (ranging from 1.41:1 to 1.68:1, depending on the site measured on the papilla). Such a finding in subjects with normal vision was considered to demonstrate the tendency for older lenses to become yellow, which would reduce the CTR. Patients (n = 33) who were being followed clinically for developing lens opacification had their CTRs measured for correlation with their visual acuities. Here, strong correlation (P less than 0.001) was observed. Evaluation of the improvement wrought by the implantation of an intraocular lens in yet another group of patients (n = 38) revealed an increase in the CTR to a virtually normal level (1.97:1). This method provides information about the actual optical efficiency of the lens when the other ocular media are clear, supplementing other methods for evaluating lens density and clarity, and thus further facilitating critical assessment of the progress of lens opacification."

A cross-sectional study was carried out in 90 subjects divided in three groups of 30 each (FD subjects, asymptomatic carriers and controls). The study was developed at the Dysautonomia Center, New York University Medical Center. All subjects underwent spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and full neuro-ophthalmic examinations. In a subset of affected subjects, visual evoked potentials and microperimetry were also obtained. We compared the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness from OCT between the three groups. OCT showed loss of the RNFL in all FD subjects predominantly in the maculopapillary region (63 % temporally, p < 0.0001; and 21 % nasally, p < 0.005). RNFL loss was greatest in older FD subjects and was associated with decreased visual acuity and color vision, central visual field defects, temporal optic nerve pallor, and delayed visual evoked potentials. Asymptomatic carriers of the FD gene mutation all had thinner RNFL (12 % globally, p < 0.005). OCT and clinical neuro-ophthalmological findings suggest that maculopapillary ganglion cells are primarily affected in FD subjects, leading to a specific optic nerve damage that closely resembles mitochondrial optic neuropathies. This raises the possibility that reduced IKAP levels may affect mitochondrial proteins and their function in the nervous system, particularly in the retina."

CD008803,0,17542978,0,Hypotony maculopathy.,"Hypotony maculopathy, first described in 1954 by Dellaporta, usually occurs after antiglaucomatous surgery or after perforating eye injuries; it is characterized by hypotony associated with fundus abnormalities, including papilloedema, vascular tortuosity and chorioretinal folds. In hypotony maculopathy, the scleral wall collapses inward, resulting in redundancy of the choroid and retina, leading to chorioretinal wrinkling. As the antero-posterior diameter of the vitreous cavity decreases, the very thick perivofeal retina surrounding the very thin foveal retina is thrown into radial folds around the fovea. It has been reported that hypotony maculopathy occurs in up to 20% of cases of glaucoma filtering surgery and has become more common after the introduction of antimetabolites. Young age, myopia, primary filtering surgery, systemic illnesses and elevated preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) have been found to be associated with hypotony maculopathy. Hypotony maculopathy is treated with procedures designed to elevate IOP, which may reverse the inward scleral bowing and improve visual acuity. The successful treatment of hypotony maculopathy depends on the correct identification of its cause. Once the cause is detected, treatment should be employed as soon as possible because delayed normalization of the IOP may result in permanent macular chorioretinal changes and poor vision. This review will explore the definition, mechanisms, clinical findings and treatment of hypotony maculopathy."

CD008803,0,20940995,0,Rapid volumetric OCT image acquisition using compressive sampling.,"Acquiring three dimensional image volumes with techniques such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) relies on reconstructing the tissue layers based on reflection of light from tissue interfaces. One B-mode scan in an image is acquired by scanning and concatenating several A-mode scans, and several contiguous slices are acquired to assemble a full 3D image volume. In this work, we demonstrate how Compressive Sampling (CS) can be used to accurately reconstruct 3D OCT images with minimal quality degradation from a subset of the original image. The full 3D image is reconstructed from sparsely sampled data by exploiting the sparsity of the image in a carefully chosen transform domain. We use several sub-sampling schemes, recover the full 3D image using CS, and show that there is negligible effect on clinically relevant morphometric measurements of the optic nerve head in the recovered image. The potential outcome of this work is a significant reduction in OCT image acquisition time, with possible extensions to speeding up acquisition in other imaging modalities such as ultrasound and MRI."

It has been found a positive correlation between the blue-yellow color vision defects and the perimetric changes in the glaucomatous eyes.

CD008803,0,18976421,0,Structural and functional imaging of the retina: new ways to diagnose and assess retinal disease.,"This paper describes optical coherence tomography (OCT) and the multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG), two recently available examination modes. Some of the limitations and disadvantages of using the techniques are discussed. The utility and scope of the techniques in diagnosis and assessment of some aspects of glaucoma are compared. OCT provides structural information and is fast, requiring no preparation of the patient; the output is immediately available. Current measurements of macular or peripapillary thickness provide useful quantitative data to assist in diagnosis and in monitoring the progress and any treatment of eye disease. New outputs may provide more sensitive methods of diagnosis than those currently available but it is important that such methods are carefully validated. mfERG takes longer to perform than OCT, requires preparation of the patient and the output may not be immediately available. Some outputs are complex and may require expertise in interpretation, which is not available to the average practitioner. Typically, mfERG systems are available only in specialist centres where research is carried out and where patients are referred for evaluation. It is likely that the procedures of the mfERG are so time consuming and complex that they will never reach the level of the general practitioner. Many mfERG protocols have not been widely used and there is scope for application of these protocols in spatial, temporal and contrast domains to improve the way in which they discriminate normal from abnormal visual systems. Until protocols have been standardised and their use is widespread, the findings from such reports should be viewed with a degree of caution. Currently, OCT is more widely accepted and more useful than the mfERG for evaluation of glaucoma and a wide range of other ocular defects."

CD008803,0,24308226,0,Macular thickness after glaucoma filtration surgery.,"The aim of present study was to analyze early postoperative changes in the macular area using optical coherence tomography (OCT) after uncomplicated glaucoma filtration surgery. This prospective study included 32 patients (34 eyes) with open-angle glaucoma, which underwent trabeculectomy with or without use of mitomycin C. Exclusion criteria were macular edema, uveitis, age-related macular degeneration, blurred optical media, secondary glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma. All standard clinical examinations were made before surgery, at the 2nd day, 1 week and 1 month after surgery. Tomography of the macula was performed during every examination using Cirrus HD OCT for the analysis of central subfield thickness. Results show that thickening of the macula was slightly higher 1 week and 1 month after operation in comparison with baseline end 2nd day postoperativelly. There was no significant difference in the change of macular thickness in patients who have used topical prostaglandins compared with those who have used other topical medications. Also, there was no difference in macular changes between patients treated with or without mitomycin C. In conclusion, we found a slight subclinical increase in macular thickness after uncomplicated trabeculectomy, for which we considered that was the result in reduction of intraocular pressure after glaucoma surgery. Macular thickening after glaucoma filtering surgery could be a physiological reaction to the stress of the retina caused by a sudden reduction of intraocular pressure and it is the consequence of altered relationship between capillary pressure and interstitial fluid pressure."

CD008803,0,23880375,0,Automated drusen segmentation and quantification in SD-OCT images.,"Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is a useful tool for the visualization of drusen, a retinal abnormality seen in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD); however, objective assessment of drusen is thwarted by the lack of a method to robustly quantify these lesions on serial OCT images. Here, we describe an automatic drusen segmentation method for SD-OCT retinal images, which leverages a priori knowledge of normal retinal morphology and anatomical features. The highly reflective and locally connected pixels located below the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) are used to generate a segmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer. The observed and expected contours of the RPE layer are obtained by interpolating and fitting the shape of the segmented RPE layer, respectively. The areas located between the interpolated and fitted RPE shapes (which have nonzero area when drusen occurs) are marked as drusen. To enhance drusen quantification, we also developed a novel method of retinal projection to generate an en face retinal image based on the RPE extraction, which improves the quality of drusen visualization over the current approach to producing retinal projections from SD-OCT images based on a summed-voxel projection (SVP), and it provides a means of obtaining quantitative features of drusen in the en face projection. Visualization of the segmented drusen is refined through several post-processing steps, drusen detection to eliminate false positive detections on consecutive slices, drusen refinement on a projection view of drusen, and drusen smoothing. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate that our method is effective for drusen segmentation. In a preliminary analysis of the potential clinical utility of our methods, quantitative drusen measurements, such as area and volume, can be correlated with the drusen progression in non-exudative AMD, suggesting that our approach may produce useful quantitative imaging biomarkers to follow this disease and predict patient outcome."

A cross-sectional study of open-angle glaucoma patients of various stages was performed. Scanning laser tomographic (TopSS) assessment of the ONH and scanning laser polarimetric (Nerve Fiber Analyzer) measurements of the peripapillary NFL thickness (NFLT) were compared to results of computerized static perimetry (Octopus G-1). One eye from each of 157 glaucoma suspects (n = 58) and patients with established open-angle glaucoma (n = 99) was assessed. The parameter ""modulation"" (difference between maximum and minimum of NFLT) gave the best correlation (r2 = 0.23) to the visual field index for mean sensitivity. Tomography gave the best correlation between the neuroretinal rim area at the inferior and superior pole of the ONH and the visual field index loss variance (r2 = 0.20). Conventional planimetric data of the ONH and clinical assessment of the NFL yielded slightly better correlations to the visual field data than the scanning laser tomography or polarimetry. Although NFL parameters are more complicated to obtain, they yield better correlations to diffuse visual field loss than parameters of the ONH. The new scanning laser techniques do not improve these correlations between morphology and function; however, they allow objective assessment of ONH and NFL parameters without mydriasis."

In the present study, the body of the literature documenting the normal retinal and choroidal thickness are reviewed and the effects of sex, age, and axial length on retinal/choroidal thickness are discussed. Macular, retinal layer, and choroidal thickness measured on OCT images in normal eyes showed significant variations by sex and age. Macular retinal thickness was greater in men than in women, especially in the center, inner ring, and outer temporal ring areas as defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). Moreover, inner retinal thickness decreased with increasing age and choroidal thickness was greater in men than in women and was negatively correlated with age and axial length. These findings provide information that should be considered in analyses of retinal or choroidal thickness in OCT studies of retinal diseases and glaucoma."

Low-resolution PM-SAD-OCT retinal images acquired from a healthy human subject show the variation of RNFL scattering properties at retinal locations around the optic nerve head. The results are consistent with known retinal ganglion cell neural anatomy and principles of light scattering. Application of PM-SAD-OCT may provide potentially valuable diagnostic information for clinical retinal imaging.

CD008803,0,15910111,0,Active retinal tracker for clinical optical coherence tomography systems.,"An active, hardware-based retinal tracker is integrated with a clinical optical coherence tomography (OCT) system to investigate the effects of stabilization on acquisition of high-resolution retinal sections. The prototype retinal tracker locks onto common fundus features, detects transverse eye motion via changes in feature reflectance, and positions the OCT diagnostic beam to fixed coordinates on the retina with mirrors driven by a feedback control loop. The system is tested in a full clinical protocol on subjects with normal and glaucomatous eyes. Experimental analysis software is developed to coalign and coadd multiple fundus and OCT images and to extract quantitative information on the location of structures in the images. Tracking is highly accurate and reproducible on all but one subject, resulting in the ability to scan the same retinal location continually over long periods of time. The results show qualitative improvement in 97% of coadded OCT scans and a reduction in the variance of the position of the optic disc cup edge to less than 1 pixel (< 60 microm). The tracking system can be easily configured for use in research on ultra-high-resolution OCT systems for advanced image modalities. For example, tracking will enable very high density 3-D scans of the retina, which are susceptible to eye motion artifacts even for new high-speed systems."

CD008803,0,24388709,0,Imaging of the optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer: an essential part of glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring.,"Because glaucomatous damage is irreversible early detection of structural changes in the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer is imperative for timely diagnosis of glaucoma and monitoring of its progression. Significant improvements in ocular imaging have been made in recent years. Imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy rely on different properties of light to provide objective structural assessment of the optic nerve head, retinal nerve fiber layer and macula. In this review, we discuss the capabilities of these imaging modalities pertinent for diagnosis of glaucoma and detection of progressive glaucomatous damage and provide a review of the current knowledge on the clinical performance of these technologies."
CD008803,0,14649743,0,Tracking the optic nervehead in OCT video using dual eigenspaces and an adaptive vascular distribution model.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new ophthalmic imaging modality generating cross sectional views of the retina. OCT systems are essentially Michelson interferometers that form images in 1.5 s by directing a superluminescent diode (SLD) beam over the retinal surface. Involuntary eye motions frequently cause incorrect locations to be imaged. This motion may leave no obvious artifacts in the scan data and can easily go undetected. For glaucoma monitoring especially, knowing the measurement path, typically a circle concentric with the nerve head, is crucial. The commercially available OCT system displays a near-infrared video of the retina showing the SLD beam. This paper presents a prototype system to detect the nerve head and SLD beam in the video, and report the true scan path relative to the nerve head. Low image contrast and limited resolution make the reliable detection of retinal features difficult. In an adaptive model construction phase, the system directly detects retinal vasculature and the nerve head and incrementally builds a model of the current subject's vascular pattern relative to the optic disk. The nerve head identification is multitiered, using a novel dual eigenspace technique and a geometric comparison of detected vessel positions and nerve head hypotheses. In its operational phase, a correspondence is achieved between the currently detected vasculature and the model. Using subjects not included in training, the system located the optic nerve head to within 5 pixels (0.07 optic disk diameters, an error well below clinical significance) in 99.75% of 2800 video fields. In current clinical practice, motions as large as 1-2 disc diameters may go undetected, so this is a vast improvement."

CD008803,0,17354945,0,A region based algorithm for vessel detection in retinal images.,"Accurate retinal blood vessel detection offers a great opportunity to predict and detect the stages of various ocular and systemic diseases, such as glaucoma, hypertension and congestive heart failure, since the change in width of blood vessels in retina has been reported as an independent and significant prospective risk factor for such diseases. In large-population studies of disease control and prevention, there exists an overwhelming need for an automatic tool that can reliably and accurately identify and measure retinal vessel diameters. To address requirements in this clinical setting, a vessel detection algorithm is proposed to quantitatively measure the salient properties of retinal vessel and combine the measurements by Bayesian decision to generate a confidence value for each detected vessel segment. The salient properties of vessels provide an alternative approach for retinal vessel detection at a level higher than detection at the pixel level. Experiments show superior detection performance than currently published results using a publicly available data set. More importantly, the proposed algorithm provides the confidence measurement that can be used as an objective criterion to select reliable vessel segments for diameter measurement."

The goal of the study was to compare ONH parameters in patients with different stages of glaucoma. Analysis of obtained data showed inconsiderable difference in absolute parametric indices, this is explained by different principles of ONH borders detection (OCT - the margin of pigment epithelium layer, HRT - scleral rim) as well as subjectivity in contour detection.

GDx parameters were compared using ANOVA. The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve for each GDx-NFA variable was used to diagnose each parameter, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the association between GDx-NFA parameters and visual field indices in early glaucoma. The best GDx parameters to discriminate between early glaucomatous and normal subjects were the number, maximum modulation, ellipse modulation and inferior ratio (i.e. area under the ROC curve > 0.8). A value for the Number of equal to or greater than 27 was optimal for detecting early glaucoma, with a sensitivity of 80.3% and specificity of 80.7%.

CD008803,0,25136603,0,Anterior segment optical coherence tomography imaging of conjunctival filtering blebs after glaucoma surgery.,"Time domain (TD) and spectral domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT) are cross-sectional, noncontact, high-resolution diagnostic modalities for posterior and anterior segment (AS) imaging. The AS-OCT provides tomographic imaging of the cornea, iris, lens, and anterior chamber (AC) angle in several ophthalmic diseases. In glaucoma, AS-OCT is utilized to evaluate the morphology of AS structures involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, to obtain morphometric measures of the AC, to evaluate the suitability for laser or surgical approaches, and to assess modifications after treatment. In patients undergoing surgery, AS-OCT is crucial in the evaluation of the filtering bleb functionality, permitting a combined qualitative and quantitative analysis. In this field, AS-OCT may help clinicians in distinguishing between functioning and nonfunctioning blebs by classifying their macroscopic morphology, describing bleb-wall features, bleb cavity, and scleral opening. This information is critical in recognizing signs of filtration failure earlier than the clinical approach and in planning the appropriate timing for management procedures in failing blebs. In this review, we summarize the applications of AS-OCT in the conjunctival bleb assessment."
CD008803,0,20566483,0,A serial study of retinal changes following optic neuritis with sample size estimates for acute neuroprotection trials.,"Following an episode of optic neuritis, thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer, which indicates axonal loss, is observed using optical coherence tomography. The longitudinal course of the retinal changes has not been well characterized. We performed a serial optical coherence tomography study in patients presenting with optic neuritis in order to define the temporal evolution of retinal nerve fibre layer changes and to estimate sample sizes for proof-of-concept trials of neuroprotection using retinal nerve fibre layer loss as the outcome measure. Twenty-three patients (7 male, 16 female, mean age 31 years) with acute clinically isolated unilateral optic neuritis were recruited to undergo optical coherence tomography, visual assessments and visual evoked potentials at presentation (median 16 days from onset of visual loss) and after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. Compared with the clinically unaffected fellow eye, the retinal nerve fibre layer thickness of the affected eye was significantly increased at presentation and significantly reduced at all later time points. The evolution of retinal nerve fibre layer changes in the affected eye fitted well with an exponential model, with thinning appearing a mean of 1.6 months from symptom onset and the rate of ongoing retinal nerve fibre layer loss decreasing thereafter. At presentation, increased retinal nerve fibre layer thickness was associated with impaired visual acuity and prolonged visual evoked potential latency. Visual function after 12 months was not related to the extent of acute retinal nerve fibre layer swelling but was significantly associated with the extent of concurrent retinal nerve fibre layer loss. Sample size calculations for placebo-controlled trials of acute neuroprotection indicated that the numbers needed after 6 months of follow up are smaller than those after 3 months and similar to those after 12 months of follow-up. Study power was greater when investigating differences between clinically unaffected and affected eyes rather than retinal nerve fibre layer thickness of the affected eye alone. Inflammation in the optic nerve and impaired axonal transport (implied by retinal nerve fibre layer swelling) are associated with visual dysfunction and demyelination (long visual evoked potential latency) during acute optic neuritis. Retinal nerve fibre layer thinning is usually evident within 3 months. Optical coherence tomography-measured retinal nerve fibre layer loss after 6 months is a suitable outcome measure for proof-of-concept trials of acute neuroprotection in optic neuritis."

CD008803,0,19827259,0,Automated diagnosis of glaucoma using digital fundus images.,"Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve caused by the increase in the intraocular pressure of the eye. Glaucoma mainly affects the optic disc by increasing the cup size. It can lead to the blindness if it is not detected and treated in proper time. The detection of glaucoma through Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Heidelberg Retinal Tomography (HRT) is very expensive. This paper presents a novel method for glaucoma detection using digital fundus images. Digital image processing techniques, such as preprocessing, morphological operations and thresholding, are widely used for the automatic detection of optic disc, blood vessels and computation of the features. We have extracted features such as cup to disc (c/d) ratio, ratio of the distance between optic disc center and optic nerve head to diameter of the optic disc, and the ratio of blood vessels area in inferior-superior side to area of blood vessel in the nasal-temporal side. These features are validated by classifying the normal and glaucoma images using neural network classifier. The results presented in this paper indicate that the features are clinically significant in the detection of glaucoma. Our system is able to classify the glaucoma automatically with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 80% respectively."

CD008803,0,16872333,0,Fred Hollows lecture: hypertensive retinopathy - a journey from fundoscopy to digital imaging.,"Hypertensive retinopathy refers to a spectrum of retinal microvascular signs that develop in response to elevated blood pressure. These signs are broadly divided into localized signs (focal retinal arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, hard exudates and microaneurysms) and diffuse signs (generalized retinal arteriolar narrowing, arterial wall opacification and optic disc oedema). Although their association with systemic morbidity was recognized more than a century ago, the prognostic significance of hypertensive retinopathy has not received much attention. In large part, this is because clinical assessment of hypertensive retinopathy signs with the direct fundoscopy has proven imprecise. Data from large population-based studies in the past decade, using retinal photographic methods to define hypertensive retinopathy signs, have provided new insights into the epidemiology, systemic associations and clinical significance of hypertensive retinopathy. These studies show that hypertensive retinopathy signs are common (up to 14% of adults aged 40 years and older, even in those without clinical diabetes or hypertension) and are strongly associated with blood pressure. Various retinopathy signs predict the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and cardiovascular mortality, independent of blood pressure and other risk factors. These data suggest that patients with hypertensive retinopathy signs may benefit from a careful cardiovascular evaluation, and appropriate risk reduction therapy if indicated. Future advances in digital retinal imaging technology will allow researchers and clinicians to better chart and monitor the vascular effects of hypertension."

We show that this approach can be formulated as a closed-form solution without any search, which leads to highly efficient and 100% repeatable computation. Our tests on the ORIGA and SCES datasets show that the performance of this method compares favorably to those of previous techniques while operating at faster speeds.

An analysis of normative data for standard automated perimetry (SAP) sensitivities and optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures of RNFL thickness showed that the apparent disagreement in age-dependent losses of RGCs and axons in the RNFL can be reconciled by an age-dependent decrease in the proportion of the RNFL thickness that is composed of axons.

CD008803,0,21705690,0,Optical coherence tomography of the swollen optic nerve head: deformation of the peripapillary retinal pigment epithelium layer in papilledema.,"PURPOSE. To examine the biomechanical deformation of load bearing structures of the optic nerve head (ONH) resulting from raised intracranial pressure, using high definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT). The authors postulate that elevated intracranial pressure induces forces in the retrolaminar subarachnoid space that can deform ONH structures, particularly the peripapillary Bruch's membrane (BM) and RPE layers. METHODS. The authors compared HD-OCT optic nerve and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) findings in eyes with papilledema caused by raised intracranial pressure to findings in eyes with optic disc swelling caused by optic neuritis and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), conditions without intracranial hypertension. The authors measured average thickness of the RNFL and the angle of the RPE/BM at the temporal and nasal borders of the neural canal opening. The angle was measured as positive with inward (toward the vitreous) angulation and as negative with outward angulation. RESULTS. Of 30 eyes with papilledema, 20 eyes (67%) had positive RPE/BM rim angles. One of eight optic neuritis (12%) eyes and 1 of 12 NAION (8%) eyes had positive angulation. In five eyes with papilledema, RNFL thickening increased, three of which developed positive RPE/BM angles. On follow-up, 22 papilledema eyes had a reduction of RNFL swelling, and 17 of these eyes had less positive RPE/BM angulation. CONCLUSIONS. In papilledema, the RPE/BM is commonly deflected inward, in contrast to eyes with NAION or optic neuritis. The RPE/BM angulation is presumed to be caused by elevated pressure in the subarachnoid space, does not correlate with the amount of RNFL swelling, and resolves as papilledema subsides."

For demonstration, an ultrahigh sensitive OMAG system operating in the 850 nm wavelength region and a 500 kHz A-scan rate resulting in a spatial resolution of ∼6  μm were used. It was shown that OMAG provides superior results for three-dimensional imaging of the ONH compared to conventional optical coherence tomography by simultaneously recording both the microstructure and the functional microcirculation. The blood supply to the tissues of the ONH is an essential physiologic parameter needed for clinical assessment of the health of the nerve."

CD008803,0,9283148,0,Short-term change of optic nerve head topography after trabeculectomy in adult glaucoma patients as measured by Heidelberg retina tomograph.,"Using Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) we investigated whether reversal of glaucomatous optic disc cupping occurs in adult glaucoma patients following intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction by trabeculectomy, and whether topographic change in the optic disc differs according to region. Thirteen eyes of 13 glaucoma patients in whom IOP reduction was 25% or more at postoperative follow-up of 2 months were enrolled in the study. Cup/disc area ratio had decreased significantly, while rim area and rim volume showed significant increases (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Among the optic disc sectors, rim area in the superior and inferior quadrants, especially in the superotemporal and inferotemporal octant, had increased significantly. The decrease in maximum cup death correlated significantly with the recent IOP reduction (r = 0.698, p = 0.016). Reversal of glaucomatous disc cupping after IOP reduction following trabeculectomy in adult patients as confirmed by HRT. Furthermore, the regions of selective reversal in the superior and inferior quadrants coincided with those parts of the optic nerve head in which early functional and structural glaucomatous damage has been known to occur."

Fifty-three patients with open-angle glaucoma and forty-three normal subjects matched for age, race and refractive error were studied. To extract circumferential profiles, we developed software to quantify RPSH from images obtained with a CSLO (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT), Heidelberg Engineering, Germany, Software: IR1-V1.11) outside the optic disc margin every 50 microns. Mean heights from circumferential profiles were calculated and compared between normal and glaucoma. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the mean height to discriminate normal from glaucoma subjects. T he average (+/- SD) visual field mean deviation in the glaucoma group was -4.8 +/- 3.4dB. The average height of each circumference increased from the disc margin to 250 microns away in both normal and glaucoma subjects. There were statistically significant differences for the mean height (P < 0.001) between the two groups. The largest difference between normal and glaucoma was found in the inferior sector compared with the other sectors (p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic precision of the mean height were 83%, 67% and 76%, respectively. The mean height from the circumferential profiles of RPSH can be used as a useful marker to identify early glaucoma."

CD008803,0,11377453,0,Clinical detection of optic nerve damage: measuring changes in cup steepness with use of a new image alignment algorithm.,"The purpose of this study was to study the effect of a subpixel image alignment algorithm on the standard deviation (SD) of mean topography images obtained by laser scanning tomography and to evaluate changes of the cup shape measure parameter (CSM) over time based upon the individual parameter variability using the new algorithm. Triple measurements from optic nerve heads of 132 eyes of 132 subjects were obtained using the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph HRT. To calculate a mean topography image from three single topography images, alignment of the raw optical section image data was performed with the standard software and again with a new subpixel-based image alignment algorithm. The effect on the averaged (SD) of the mean topography images was evaluated. CSM was evaluated in 15 eyes of 15 normal subjects (N) and 28 eyes of 14 glaucoma patients (G) over a period of 28.6 +/- 4.6 months (N) and 28.56 +/- 5.2 months (G) respectively. A change in the CSM value over time was considered significant if CSM measurements exceeded two standard deviations of this variable determined for the individual eye. Mean-topography image SD was 22.86 +/- 8.2 microns (min. 9.5 microm; max. 47.8 microm) with the standard alignment procedure and 15.46 +/- 6.8 microm (min. 6.8 microm; max. 42.8 microm) with the new algorithm. The average SD improvement was 7.46 +/- 3.9 microns (min. -8.1 microm; max. 28.7 microm). The coefficient of correlation of both methods was R(2) = 0.77 (p < 0.0001). No control group eye demonstrated significant changes of CSM in the follow-up period. The CSM indicated an increase in cup steepness in 4 eyes of 4 glaucoma patients. In one of these four eyes, a deterioration of the visual field was identified by white on white perimetry. The new image alignment algorithm significantly reduces the SD of mean topography images calculated from identical raw data. If topometric variables are evaluated over time, the individual variability of data should be taken into account."

CD008803,0,25315395,0,The usefulness of multimodal imaging for differentiating pseudopapilloedema and true swelling of the optic nerve head: a review and case series.,"Ophthalmic practitioners have to make a critical differential diagnosis in cases of an elevated optic nerve head. They have to discriminate between pseudopapilloedema (benign elevation of the optic nerve head) and true swelling of the optic nerve head. This decision has significant implications for appropriate patient management. Assessment of the optic disc prior to the advanced imaging techniques that are available today (particularly spectral domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence), has mainly used diagnostic tools, such as funduscopy and retinal photography. As these traditional methods rely on the subjective assessment by the clinician, evaluation of the elevated optic nerve head to differentiate pseudopapilloedema from true swelling of the optic nerve head can be a challenge in clinical practice with patients typically referred for further neuroimaging investigation when the diagnosis is uncertain. The use of multimodal ocular imaging tools such as spectral domain optical coherence tomography, short wavelength fundus autofluorescence and ultrasonography, can potentially aid in the differentiation of pseudopapilloedema from true swelling of the optic nerve head, in conjunction with other clinical findings. By doing so, unnecessary patient costs and anxiety in the case of pseudopapilloedema can be reduced, and appropriate urgent referral and management in the case of true swelling of the optic nerve head can be initiated."

Infrared fundus imaging and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) (Spectralis HRA+OCT, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) centered at the fovea were performed on 72 healthy adults. On the infrared fundus images, we measured (a) the distance between the foveola and the temporal edge of the optic disc (FOD) and (b) the distance between the foveola and the temporal edge of the peripapillary crescent (FOC) (if present). A peripapillary crescent presented at the nasal margin of the disc in 64% of the subjects. The FOD and FOC were 4.22mm±0.46 and 3.97mm±0.25, respectively. Only the FOD was significantly correlated with axial length. As AL increased by 10%, the FOD increased by 13%, the outer neural retina only expanded by 4% (as indicated by the FOC). This result emphasizes that retinal stretching may not mirror scleral growth, and the existence in some eyes of a difference between the photoreceptor margin and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) margin suggests that within the retina there could be slippage during eye growth."

The number of referrals and true positives generated by each mode was estimated for a model population, which was distributed with respect to age, intraocular pressure (IOP), optic disc condition, visual field defects, family history of glaucoma, and myopic status, as indicated by epidemiological studies. The costs of primary examination, and also of the secondary examination of referrals, were estimated for each mode, thus enabling the total cost per true positive to be calculated (in Pound sterling at 1995 UK prices, subsequently converted to US dollars at Pound 1.00 = $1.55.) The modes using O and T routinely, with P either routinely or selectively on all glaucoma high-risk groups, were found to provide the best balance between sensitivity (> or = 80%) and cost per true positive. The latter was around $850 when the cost of ophthalmoscopy could be shared as part of a general eye examination. The calculations assumed a 0.6% prevalence of previously undetected glaucomas in the community: with higher prevalences, costs per true positive would be lower. Screening the 40-59 years age group was found to be about as economic as for older people, when life expectancy was taken into account. It was concluded that glaucoma screening of people over age 40 years could be justifiable, provided that it is worth more than about $850 to detect a new case. Whilst based on UK values, the analysis could be applied to different primary health care settings in other countries."

Age at examination ranged from infancy to the fourth decade. The optic discs were normal in 53 (69%) of the 77 patients examined; 18 (23%) had varying degrees of optic atrophy; 2 (3%), pseudopapilledema; and 1 (1%), grey discs. The optic discs could not be seen in 3 (4%) patients. We conclude that the optic discs are frequently normal in appearance, even in older patients with LCA."
CD008803,0,17867804,0,In vivo total retinal blood flow measurement by Fourier domain Doppler optical coherence tomography.,There is considerable interest in new methods for the assessment of retinal blood flow for the diagnosis of eye diseases. We present in vivo normal human volumetric retinal flow measurement using Fourier domain Doppler optical coherence tomography. We used a dual-plane scanning pattern to determine the angle between the blood flow and the scanning beam in order to measure total flow velocity. Volumetric flow in each blood vessel around the optic nerve head was integrated in one cardiac cycle in each measurement. Measurements were performed in the right eye of one human subject. The measured venous flow velocity ranged from 16.26 mm/s to 29.7 mm/s. The arterial flow velocity ranged from 38.35 mm/s to 51.13 mm/s. The total retinal venous and arterial flow both added up to approximately 54 microl/min. We believe this is the first demonstration of total retinal blood flow measurement using the OCT technique.

The fully automated segmentation algorithm, FloatingCanvas, serves this purpose and performs a volumetric segmentation of retinal tissue layers in three-dimensional image volume acquired around the optic nerve head without requiring any pre-processing. The reconstructed layers are analyzed to extract features such as blood vessels and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness. Findings from images obtained with the RTVue-100 SD-OCT (Optovue, Fremont, CA, USA) indicate that FloatingCanvas is computationally efficient and is robust to the noise and low contrast in the images. The FloatingCanvas segmentation demonstrated good agreement with the human manual grading. The retinal nerve fibre layer thickness maps obtained with this method are clinically realistic and highly reproducible compared with time-domain StratusOCT(TM)."

The aim of this study was to explore the topographical pattern of damage to the brain white matter (WM) tracts from patients with chronic LHON using diffusion tensor (DT) MRI and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Brain dual-echo and DT MRI scans were acquired from 13 patients with chronic LHON and 25 matched controls using a 3.0 T scanner. TBSS analysis was performed using the FMRIB's Diffusion Toolbox. A complete neuro-ophthalmologic examination, including standardized automated Humphrey perimetry as well as average and temporal peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (PRNFL) measurements, was obtained in all patients. Mean average and temporal PRNFL thicknesses were decreased significantly in LHON patients. Compared to controls, TBSS analysis revealed significant diffusivity abnormalities in these patients, which were characterized by a decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and an increased mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity, affecting exclusively the optic tracts and optic radiations (OR). In patients, a significant correlation was found between optic tract average FA and mean visual acuity (r = 0.57, p = 0.04). In LHON patients, DT MRI reveals a microstructural alteration of the WM along the entire visual pathways, with a sparing of the other main WM tracts of the brain. Damage to the OR may be secondary either to trans-synaptic degeneration, which in turn is due to neuroaxonal loss in the retina and optic nerve, or to local mitochondrial dysfunction."

CD008803,0,12950891,0,Computerised calculation scheme for ocular magnification with the Zeiss telecentric fundus camera.,"Littmann (1982) described a method to determine the magnification of the eye in order to relate the size of a retinal feature to its measured image size on a telecentric fundus camera film. This required information only about ametropia and corneal curvature. Several other methods have been reported since then which consider other biometric data to enhance the accuracy of this classical method. The purpose of this study is to describe a numerical calculation scheme to determine the magnification q of the eye in two cardinal meridians using paraxial raytracing. Our calculation scheme is based on ametropia, keratometry, as well as biometric data such as axial length, anterior chamber depth and thickness of the crystalline lens. It is described step-by-step in order (1) to determine the refractive powers of both surfaces of the crystalline lens, which are not directly measurable in vivo, (2) to derive the retinal image conjugate to a circular object using paraxial raytracing, (3) to fit an ellipse to the retinal image, (4) to determine the secondary principal points (Gaussian length) separately for both cardinal meridians and (5) to calculate the ocular magnification q. The power of the crystalline lens is estimated to compensate for the spherocylindrical refraction at the spectacle plane and the corneal refraction with an astigmatic component thus creating a sharp image focused at the retinal plane. The capabilities of this computing scheme are demonstrated with five clinical examples and are related to the respective values of the classical Littmann formula as well as to enhanced methods described by Bennett (1988), Bennett et al. (1994) and Garway-Heath et al. (1998)."

CD008803,0,18931386,0,Visual system involvement in patients with Friedreich's ataxia.,"Optic neuropathy is common in mitochondrial disorders, but poorly characterized in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), a recessive condition caused by lack of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. We investigated 26 molecularly confirmed FRDA patients by studying both anterior and posterior sections of the visual pathway using a new, integrated approach. This included visual field testing and optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern visual evoked potentials (P-VEPs) and diffusion-weighted imaging. The latter was used to study optic radiation by calculating water apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC). All patients suffered optic nerve involvement with their disorder. Different patterns of visual field defects were observed and a variably reduced retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was seen by OCT in all cases. P-VEPs were abnormal in approximately half of the patients. Decreased visual acuity and temporal optic disc pallor were present in advanced stages of the disease, but only five patients were symptomatic. Two of these patients suffered a sudden loss of central vision, mimicking Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), and of the other three symptomatic patients two were noted to be compound heterozygotes. ADC values of optic radiations in patients were significantly higher than controls (P < 0.01). Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness at OCT and P-VEPs correlated with age at onset and ICARS total score. ADC values correlated with age at onset, disease duration, GAA triplet expansion size, ICARS total score and P-VEPs. Visual pathway involvement is found consistently in FRDA, being previously underestimated, and we here document that it also involves the optic radiations. Occasional LHON-like cases may occur. However, optic neuropathy in FRDA substantially differs from classic mitochondrial optic neuropathies implying a different pathophysiology of visual system degeneration in this mitochondrial disease."

FDT C20-1 screening program and a scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) system (GDx-NFA) was used to assess 53 glaucomatous eyes, 53 glaucoma suspects and 36 normal control eyes. In glaucomatous eyes, there were correlations between the FDT the screening algorithm and RNFL retardation values in several polarimetric indices, most significantly ""inferior thickness"" (r = -0.321, P = 0.029). In the eyes of glaucoma suspects, however, we observed no correlation between the FDT results and RNFL retardation values (r = 0.080, P > 0.05, ""inferior thickness""). In glaucomatous eyes, the abnormal scores obtained with FDT screening program correlated negatively with RNFL retardation values, as measured by SLP.

CD008803,0,22108975,0,Wide tuning range wavelength-swept laser with a single SOA at 1020 nm for ultrahigh resolution Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography.,"In this study, we demonstrated a wide tuning range wavelength-swept laser with a single semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) at 1020 nm for ultrahigh resolution, Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (UHR, FD-OCT). The wavelength-swept laser was constructed with an external line-cavity based on a Littman configuration. An optical wavelength selection filter consisted of a grating, a telescope, and a polygon scanner. Before constructing the optical wavelength selection filter, we observed that the optical power, the spectrum bandwidth, and the center wavelength of the SOA were affected by the temperature of the thermoelectric (TE) cooler in the SOA mount as well as the applied current. Therefore, to obtain a wide wavelength tuning range, we adjusted the temperature of the TE cooler in the SOA mount. When the temperature in the TE cooler was 9 °C, our swept source had a tuning range of 142 nm and a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 121.5 nm at 18 kHz. The measured instantaneous spectral bandwidth (δλ) is 0.085 nm, which was measured by an optical spectrum analyzer with a resolution bandwidth of 0.06 nm. This value corresponds to an imaging depth of 3.1 mm in air. Additionally, the averaged optical power of our swept source was 8.2 mW. In UHR, FD/SS-OCT using our swept laser, the measured axial resolution was 4.0 μm in air corresponding to 2.9 μm in tissue (n = 1.35). The sensitivity was measured to be 93.1 dB at a depth of 100 μm. Finally, we obtained retinal images (macular and optic disk) and a corneal image."

Four milligrams of tramcinolon acetonide were injected in to the vitreous cavity. Before and in one month intervals after the application, the intraocular pressure was measured, visual acuity on the ETDRS optotypes was established, the macula was examined biomicroscopically, examination of the photography of the fundus was performed, and macular thickness was measured by means of optical coherence tomography. The follow-up period was 3 months. The mean visual acuity was 0.16 at the beginning of the study, 1 month after the application 0.32, and after 3 months 0.31. The mean thickness of the macula decreased from the initial value 537 microm by 249 microm after one month (improvement by 46.6%) and by 203 miceom after three month (improvement by 39.7%).

Until a few years ago, analogue methods were used to process fundus photographs, but today digitized and computerized methods are applied. Thus, the examination has become considerably simplified and clinically practical. Two main points are discussed in connection with these modern methods. First, biomorphometry provides data useful for the understanding of glaucoma. Papillary size is meaningful with regard to the sensitivity of the papilla to pressure, and reversal of cupping depends on pressure as well. Second, for longitudinal studies to be dependable, the clinically applied methods must have a very small margin of error so that an observed papillary change can be ascribed to disease, and not to methodologic errors."

CD008803,0,21232535,0,Peripapillary choroidal thickness in glaucoma measured with optical coherence tomography.,"As choroidal changes have been suggested in glaucoma, we examined peripapillary choroidal thickness (CT) in patients with and without primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). We collected measurements retrospectively on 70 eyes of 70 patients consecutively undergoing SD-OCT. POAG (n = 31) and suspect eyes (n = 39) had two reliable and repeatable Humphrey 24-2 visual fields with glaucoma hemifield test outside or within normal limits, respectively. A 360-degree peripapillary scan was performed using the standard protocol for retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) assessment. Using provided software, two independent masked investigators manually segmented CT as the area of visible choroidal vasculature. Agreement between investigators was determined using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). A single masked observer determined clock hours of parapapillary atrophy (PPA) and the presence of ßPPA for each optic nerve quadrant. Correlation between RNFL and CT was assessed; two-sample t-tests were used to determine differences in RNFL and CT between POAG and suspect eyes; and linear regression was used to model changes in RNFL and CT. We found that independent measurements of CT by two observers were highly correlated (Lin's CCC for global CT; ρ(c) = 0.93, p < 0.001). RNFL and CT measurements were not significantly correlated for any peripapillary location (|r| ≤ 0.15, p ≥ 0.22). Global CT (ß = -1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.76, -1.13) but not RNFL thickness (ß = -0.18, 95% CI -0.58, 0.22) decreased significantly with age. Compared to suspect eyes, eyes with POAG had significantly thinner RNFL measurements at all locations (p ≤ 0.005) but CT measurements did not differ between groups for any location (p ≥ 0.13). Adjusting for glaucoma status and age, total (ß = 3.15 95% CI -0.24, 6.53) and ß clock hours of PPA (ß = 1.33, 95% CI -1.72, 4.38) were not significantly associated with global CT; the spatial distribution of PPA was not associated with underlying CT, though PPA was graded subjectively and may have been subject to spatial mismatch with a singular peripapillary eccentricity on SD-OCT. We conclude that eyes with POAG did not demonstrate reduced CT nor was there a correlation between RNFL and CT maps. This study does not support the use of CT assessment in glaucoma diagnosis or management."

The fellow uninvolved eye was used as a proxy comparison of RNFL loss in the attack eye. In 40 eligible patients, the mean age was 68.3 ± 8.7 years with a male-to-female ratio of 1:7. The mean presenting IOP was 49.2 ± 14.0 mm Hg and the time from presentation to laser iridotomy was 6.7 ± 6.9 days. Forty percent of subjects received a cataract extraction at 3.2 ± 2.9 years after the attack. The last IOP, CDR, and LogMAR vision were 16.0 ± 3.8 mm Hg, 0.6 ± 0.2, and 0.6 ± 0.6 LogMAR units, respectively, at 7.9 ± 2.4 years. The RNFL thickness in the attack eye (69.2 ± 19.1 μm) was 25.2 ± 17.9% thinner than the fellow eye (93.0 ± 17.8 μm) at 7.5 ± 2.9 years post-AAC. Using univariate analysis, the last vertical CDR (odds ratio [OR] = 17.2, P = 0.049) and LogMAR visual acuity (VA) (OR = 6.6, P = 0.03) were the only significant predictors for RNFL thinning whereas none of the other covariates showed significant associations (P > 0.1). At 7.5 years following unilateral AAC, the RNFL thickness was 25% thinner than the fellow eye. CDR enlargement and poor VA were the only significant predictors for RNFL loss."

CD008803,0,20550999,0,Fast localization of the optic disc using projection of image features.,"Optic Disc (OD) localization is an important pre-processing step that significantly simplifies subsequent segmentation of the OD and other retinal structures. Current OD localization techniques suffer from impractically-high computation times (few minutes per image). In this work, we present a fast technique that requires less than a second to localize the OD. The technique is based upon obtaining two projections of certain image features that encode the x- and y- coordinates of the OD. The resulting 1-D projections are then searched to determine the location of the OD. This avoids searching the 2-D image space and, thus, enhances the speed of the OD localization process. Image features such as retinal vessels orientation and the OD brightness are used in the current method. Four publicly-available databases, including STARE and DRIVE, are used to evaluate the proposed technique. The OD was successfully located in 330 images out of 340 images (97%) with an average computation time of 0.65 s."

The classical phenotype is characterized by neurological dysfunction, tendon xanthomas and juvenile cataracts. Other ophthalmological findings have occasionally been reported. To gain more insight into the type and frequency of ophthalmological alterations in this multisystem metabolic disorder, we examined 13 CTX patients.

CD008803,0,21917458,0,Reduced retinal nerve fiber layer and macular thickness in patients with multiple sclerosis with no history of optic neuritis identified by the use of spectral domain high-definition optical coherence tomography.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with both inflammatory and degenerative components. The visual system is frequently involved, often in the form of visual loss from optic neuritis (ON). Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) loss has been demonstrated in individuals with MS, not only in those with previous ON but also in absence of historical evidence of previous acute inflammation/demyelination of the optic nerve. Peripapillary RNFL measurements of all quadrants, central macular thickness, and average macular thickness were performed in 32 eyes of healthy volunteers and 60 eyes of individuals with a diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS using high definition spectral domain optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT). Both the Macular Cube 512 × 128 scan and RNFL measurement by the Optic Disc Cube 200 × 200 protocol were performed on all eyes. Eyes of individuals with MS with no previous ON had significantly decreased overall RNFL thickness (89.1 μm) compared to controls (98.0 μm) (p < 0.05). MS mainly affected the temporal quadrant (56.6 μm versus [vs.] 67.8 μm) (p < 0.05), and inferior quadrant (117.9 μm vs. 132.1 μm) (p < 0.05), respectively. Also, the patients with MS demonstrated significantly decreased average macular thickness (280 μm) compared to the control group (287 μm) (p < 0.05). A significant correlation between RNFL and average macular thickness was also found in eyes of patients with MS (r = 0.69, p < 0.01). HD-OCT is a quick, inexpensive and promising tool to detect subclinical changes in RNFL and macular thickness in individuals with MS. Longitudinal studies should be encouraged to examine disease progression over time in individuals with MS."

CD008803,0,25570836,0,A hierarchical framework for estimating neuroretinal rim area using 3D spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) optic nerve head (ONH) images of healthy and glaucoma eyes.,"Glaucoma is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells, resulting in distinctive changes in the optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Important advances in technology for non-invasive imaging of the eye have been made providing quantitative tools to measure structural changes in ONH topography, a crucial step in diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma. 3D spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), an optical imaging technique, has been commonly used to discriminate glaucomatous from healthy subjects. In this paper, we present a new approach for locating the Bruch's membrane opening BMO and then estimating the optic disc size and rim area of 3D Spectralis SD-OCT images. To deal with the overlapping of the Bruch's membrane BM layer and the border tissue of Elschnig due to the poor image resolution, we propose the use of image deconvolution approach to separate these layers. To estimate the optic disc size and rim area, we propose the use of a new regression method based on the artificial neural network principal component analysis (ANN-PCA), which allows us to model irregularity in the BMO estimation due to scan shifts and/or poor image quality. The diagnostic accuracy of rim area, and rim to disc area ratio is compared to the diagnostic accuracy of global RNFL thickness measurements provided by two commercially available SD-OCT devices using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses."

Involvement of the lens epithelium and, particularly, the pigment epithelium of the iris and the ciliary body epithelium are emphasized as being the likely sources of the exfoliative fibrils. A case of exfoliation syndrome in an eye with an eccentric pupil revealed that the granular material seen on the lens capsule occurs only where the iris is in contact with the lens surface and the process may even involve the central anterior capsule under proper conditions. This finding, together with the evidence of continuing deposits after intracapsular cataract extraction, suggests that the granular material is deposited from the iris and that the material formed by the lens epithelium remains within the lens capsule."

CD008803,0,19957681,0,[Development of glaucoma drainage device].,"Glaucoma drainage device (GDD) is moderately successful in patients with refractory glaucoma. However, bleb fibrosis appears to be the major cause of long-term GDD failure. In recent years, many researchers tried to explain the cause of fibrosis and its influence on the clinical effects of GDD from histopathological study. It has reported that antifibrotic agents are effective in controlling capsule fibrosis around GDD, but this view has been challenged recently. Although GDD can effectively reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) in refractory glaucoma, it is associated with many serious complications, such as endophthalmitis, corneal decompensation and hypotony. Because of the disadvantages of GDD, many new implant and modified surgical technique emerged in recent years. The anterior segment OCT is able to visualize the whole outline and the position of the tube, therefore it is useful for guiding the postoperative treatment.

It is very difficult to follow patients in this stage of the disease by standard automated perimetry. The purpose of this article is to discuss how to better follow patients with end-stage glaucoma. Monitoring of glaucoma must take into account the measurement of intraocular pressure, structural evaluation and functional assessment. Structural evaluation has only minor importance at this stage, and the most useful tool is qualitative analysis, especially through stereo disc photography, looking for disc hemorrhages. Conversely, functional assessment is of major importance. Specific techniques and strategies should be used. Patients' complaints are very important in this stage of glaucoma. Trial frames are very useful for accurate testing of visual acuity, and are preferable to phoropters. Visual field measurement must be adapted to this end stage of glaucoma, by using targeted strategies, such as: testing the central 10 degrees, testing a 24-2 field with a size V stimulus, and Goldmann perimetry. Any slight sign of worsening must be taken into account, so as to detect any progression of the disease."

Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis is a refractive technique by which corneal stromal photoablation is achieved by the structural and refractive changes induced by the excimer laser. Both techniques are becoming widely performed and there is some evidence that scanning laser polarimetry measurements are significantly changed after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis. The authors performed a larger study to determine whether laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis induces predictable and consistent alterations in the measurement of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.

We used optic neuritis as a model of multiple sclerosis relapse to quantify axonal loss of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and secondary retinal ganglion cell loss in the macula with optical coherence tomography. We studied 25 patients who had a previous single episode of optic neuritis with a recruitment bias to those with incomplete recovery and 15 control subjects. Optical coherence tomography measurement of RNFL thickness and macular volume, quantitative visual testing, and electrophysiological examination were performed. There were highly significant reductions (p < 0.001) of RNFL thickness and macular volume in affected patient eyes compared with control eyes and clinically unaffected fellow eyes. There were significant relationships among RNFL thickness and visual acuity, visual field, color vision, and visual-evoked potential amplitude. This study has demonstrated functionally relevant changes indicative of axonal loss and retinal ganglion cell loss in the RNFL and macula, respectively, after optic neuritis. This noninvasive RNFL imaging technique could be used in trials of experimental treatments that aim to protect optic nerves from axonal loss."

CD008803,0,24901248,0,Multimodality imaging methods for assessing retinoblastoma orthotopic xenograft growth and development.,"Genomic studies of the pediatric ocular tumor retinoblastoma are paving the way for development of targeted therapies. Robust model systems such as orthotopic xenografts are necessary for testing such therapeutics. One system involves bioluminescence imaging of luciferase-expressing human retinoblastoma cells injected into the vitreous of newborn rat eyes. Although used for several drug studies, the spatial and temporal development of tumors in this model has not been documented. Here, we present a new model to allow analysis of average luciferin flux ([Formula: see text]) through the tumor, a more biologically relevant parameter than peak bioluminescence as traditionally measured. Moreover, we monitored the spatial development of xenografts in the living eye. We engineered Y79 retinoblastoma cells to express a lentivirally-delivered enhanced green fluorescent protein-luciferase fusion protein. In intravitreal xenografts, we assayed bioluminescence and computed [Formula: see text], as well as documented tumor growth by intraocular optical coherence tomography (OCT), brightfield, and fluorescence imaging. In vivo bioluminescence, ex vivo tumor size, and ex vivo fluorescent signal were all highly correlated in orthotopic xenografts. By OCT, xenografts were dense and highly vascularized, with well-defined edges. Small tumors preferentially sat atop the optic nerve head; this morphology was confirmed on histological examination. In vivo, [Formula: see text] in xenografts showed a plateau effect as tumors became bounded by the dimensions of the eye. The combination of [Formula: see text] modeling and in vivo intraocular imaging allows both quantitative and high-resolution, non-invasive spatial analysis of this retinoblastoma model. This technique will be applied to other cell lines and experimental therapeutic trials in the future."

While retinal prostheses have shown some success in restoring basic levels of vision, only generic, ""one-size-fits-all"" devices are currently being implanted. In this study, we used optical coherence tomography scans of the degenerated retina from 88 patients with retinitis pigmentosa to generate models of retinal thickness and curvature for the design of customized implants. We found the average retinal thickness at the fovea to be 152.9 ± 61.3 μm, increasing to a maximum retinal thickness of 250.9 ± 57.5 μm at a nasal eccentricity of 5°. These measures could be used to assist the development of custom-made penetrating electrodes to enhance and optimize epiretinal prostheses. From the retinal thickness measurements, we determined that the optimal length of penetrating electrodes to selectively stimulate retinal ganglion cell bodies and interneuron axons in the ganglion cell layer should be 30-100 μm, and to preferentially stimulate interneurons in the inner nuclear layer, electrodes should be 100-200 μm long. Electrodes greater than 200 μm long had the potential to penetrate through the retina into the choroid, which could cause devastating complications to the eye and should be avoided. The two- and three-dimensional models of retinal thickness developed in this study can be used to design patient-specific epiretinal implants that will help with safety and to optimize the efficacy of neuronal stimulation, ensuring the best functional performance of the device for patients."

CD008803,0,23916620,0,Optical coherence tomography: imaging of the choroid and beyond.,"Seventy percent of the blood flow to the eye goes to the choroid, a structure that is vitally important to the function of the retina. The in vivo structure of the choroid in health and disease is incompletely visualized with traditional imaging modalities, including indocyanine green angiography, ultrasonography, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Use of new OCT modalities, including enhanced depth imaging OCT, image averaging, and swept-source OCT, have led to increased visualization of the choroidal anatomy. The correlation of these new anatomical findings with other imaging modalities results increases understanding of many eye diseases and recognises of new ones. The status of the choroid appears to be a crucial determinant in the pathogenesis of diseases such as age-related choroidal atrophy, myopic chorioretinal atrophy, central serous chorioretinopathy, chorioretinal inflammatory diseases, and tumors. Extension of these imaging techniques has provided insights into abnormalities of the sclera and optic nerve.

CD008803,0,20143110,0,A preliminary longitudinal study of the retinal nerve fiber layer in progressive multiple sclerosis.,"Thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) of clinically unaffected eyes is seen in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). It is uncertain when this thinning occurs, and whether ongoing RNFL loss can be measured over time with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Using time-domain OCT, we studied 34 patients with progressive MS (16 primary progressive MS, 18 secondary progressive; 14 male; 20 female; mean age at study entry 51 years; median EDSS 6; mean disease duration at study entry 12 years) on two occasions with a median interval of 575 (range 411-895) days apart. Eighteen healthy controls (10 male; eight female; mean age at study entry 46 years) were also studied twice, with a median interval of 656 days (range 398-890). Compared to controls, the patients had significant decreases in the RNFL thickness and macular volume of their clinically unaffected eyes at study entry. No significant decrease in RNFL thickness was observed between baseline and follow-up in either patients or controls. Macular volume declined significantly in patients and controls, but there was no difference in this change between the two groups. The study findings suggest that time domain OCT detects little disease-related ongoing loss of retinal axons in progressive forms of MS and has limited use for monitoring potential neuroprotective therapies at this stage of disease. Further studies are needed using higher-resolution OCT systems and in larger groups of patients, to elucidate the timing and mechanism of RNFL loss that is observed in clinically unaffected nerves in MS."

CD008803,0,19123650,0,Retinal blood flow measurement by circumpapillary Fourier domain Doppler optical coherence tomography.,"We present in vivo human total retinal blood flow measurements using Doppler Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). The scan pattern consisted of two concentric circles around the optic nerve head, transecting all retinal branch arteries and veins. The relative positions of each blood vessel in the two OCT conic cross sections were measured and used to determine the angle between the OCT beam and the vessel. The measured angle and the Doppler shift profile were used to compute blood flow in the blood vessel. The flows in the branch veins was summed to give the total retinal blood flow at one time point. Each measurement of total retinal blood flow was completed within 2 s and averaged. The total retinal venous flow was measured in one eye each of two volunteers. The results were 52.90+/-2.75 and 45.23+/-3.18 microlmin, respectively. Volumetric flow rate positively correlated with vessel diameter. This new technique may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of optic nerve and retinal diseases that are associated with poor blood flow, such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy."

CD008803,0,21640104,0,Optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements in black and white children with large cup-to-disc ratios.,"Children with large optic nerve head cups often pose diagnostic difficulty due to concern over possible glaucoma. This study's purpose was to evaluate optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular thickness in healthy eyes of black and white children, comparing values for eyes with large cup-to-disc ratios against those with small cup-to-disc ratios (normal controls). Using Stratus OCT (OCT 3) (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) a fast macular thickness and fast RNFL 3.4 protocol were performed on normal eyes of normal children. Included were children (aged 5-17 years) with normal ophthalmic examinations, drawn from data generated during an ongoing study of OCT in children. Excluded were eyes with corrected vision below 20/20, spherical equivalent >5 diopters, intraocular pressure >21 mm Hg, abnormal optic nerve rim, prematurity, family history of glaucoma. Clinical examination identified children with large cup-disc-ratios (0.5-0.8), and each was matched for age and race to a ""normal control"" with a small cup-to-disc ratio (<0.5). OCT-3 analyses were compared between eyes with optic nerve heads showing large cup-to-disc ratios (≥0.5) vs. those showing small cup-to-disc ratios (<0.5) for different sections of the macula and the peripapillary RNFL thickness. Analyses included OCT values and optic cup grading for 162 eyes of 162 children. White children with large cup-to-disc ratios had thinner mean RNFL thickness and macular volume compared to those with small cup-to-disc ratios (average RNFL = 100 ± 9 vs. 110 ± 8 μm, respectively, p = 0.0001, macular volume = 6.84 ± 0.41 vs. 7.03 ± 0.33 mm(3), respectively, p = 0.0186). On the other hand, black children with large cup-to-disc ratios had an equivalent mean RNFL thickness and macular volume compared to those with small cup-to-disc ratios average RNFL = 107 ± 10 vs. 107 ± 8 for both groups, macular volume = 6.81 ± 0.34 vs. 6.85 ± 0.28 respectively. Positive equivalence testing assumed a clinically significant difference of 10 μm for RNFL, and 0.2 mm(3) for macular volume. We report that white children with large cup-to-disc ratios have evidence of reduced/thinner RNFL and macular volume versus white children with smaller cup-to-disc ratios, as assessed by OCT. By contrast, this distinction was not found for black children in the present study."

Twenty-three eyes of 20 patients with open angle glaucoma were studied. Only those eyes were used in which NFLD reaching the temporal raphe of the nerve fiber layer was observed by the SLO in either the superior or the inferior hemisphere. We defined three topographic parameters of the NFLD: 1. the angle (0, degree) generated by a line A passing through the foveal pit and the disc center, and a line through the disc center to the point of the NFLD at the disc edge and closest to line A, 2. the horizontal distance (D1, mm) along the temporal raphe between the foveal pit and the point of the NFLD nearest to the foveal pit, and 3. the vertical distance (D2, mm) between the foveal pit and the point of NFLD nearest to the foveal pit. We also defined the nearest defect location (in degrees from the fovea) as the stimulus point with sensitivity loss greater than 6 dB in the Humphrey visual field (program central 10-2).

CD008803,0,23018425,0,Macular assessment using optical coherence tomography for glaucoma diagnosis.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an interferometry-based imaging modality that generates high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina. Circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (cpRNFL) and optic disc assessments are the mainstay of glaucomatous structural measurements. However, because these measurements are not always available or precise, it would be useful to have another reliable indicator. The macula has been suggested as an alternative scanning location for glaucoma diagnosis. Using time-domain (TD) OCT, macular measurements have been shown to provide good glaucoma diagnostic capabilities. Performance of cpRNFL measurement was generally superior to macular assessment. However, macular measurement showed better glaucoma diagnostic performance and progression detection capability in some specific cases, which suggests that these two measurements may be combined to produce a better diagnostic strategy. With the adoption of spectral-domain OCT, which allows a higher image resolution than TD-OCT, segmentation of inner macular layers becomes possible. The role of macular measurements for detection of glaucoma progression is still under investigation. Improvement of image quality would allow better visualisation, development of various scanning modes would optimise macular measurements, and further refining of the analytical algorithm would provide more accurate segmentation. With these achievements, macular measurement can be an important surrogate for glaucomatous structural assessment."

CD008803,0,18723109,0,Use of fundus perimetry (microperimetry) to quantify macular sensitivity.,"The advances in retinal imaging technologies have led to enormous innovation towards diagnostic in current ophthalmology, enabling the practitioner to detect early retinal changes and to document treatment effects. While, in the past, retinoscopy, visual acuity testing and perimetry played the major role in functional diagnostics, today, laser-based systems like laser scanning imaging systems especially for fluorescein-angiography, optical coherence tomography, electrodiagnostic systems and the analysis of retinal vessels may be used as well. However, the challenge to correlate subjective alterations or clinical changes with visual function, still remains. Micro- or fundus perimetry offers the option to test retinal sensitivity while directly observing the fundus. In this paper, we review the literature encompassing the results of more than 25 years of fundus perimetry, i.e. perimetry under simultaneous visualization of the fundus. During this time, results on known diseases and reproducibility of the technique were published, but a lot of work was also performed on the combination of different examination methods, allowing a synopsis of long-term results and new approaches by combining different methods and improving each of them. The first part of this review attends to improvements of the method. The second part addresses the clinical and diagnostic values. The final part is dedicated to diagnostic and long-term observation of fundus perimetric results beginning with common and rare diseases like age-related macular degeneration, macular holes and diabetic retinopathy, various types of macular dystrophies ending with challenges in conventional perimetry like glaucoma and malingering. Due to the experience and progress in the field of fundus perimetry and retinal imaging, the method has long passed its role of observing and has all the potential for prediction, early detection and treatment-monitoring of macular diseases."

The instrument gives measurement results on an absolute scale; the validity of the scaling has never been proven in the living eye. Eight phakic eyes (eight patients) scheduled for subsequent pars plana vitrectomy were selected for this study. The optic disc was scanned using the HRT. During vitrectomy, the disc was measured directly using a modified retina spatula that had a 2.5-mm scale with a grading of 1/10 mm at the tip. The measurement was recorded with a high-resolution video system adapted to a Zeiss operation microscope. We used a vitrectomy contact lens with a flat surface. First we looked for reference points along the disc margin that could be clearly identified on both images, then we determined the distances between these points. Calculations from HRT data followed according to the software used in this instrument. Calculations from video images were related to the grading of the intraocular scale instrument. As determined using HRT software version 1.08, the mean ratio of HRT distances obtained by direct video measurements was 1.031 (SD, +/- 0.099; SE, +/- 0.035). No significant correlation between the ratio and the ametropia of the eyes could be verified (r = 0.506, P = 0.20). On average, the two-dimensional measurements of the HRT were correct. Furthermore, we used software version 1.07, which does not correct the image size depending on refraction, and found that the mean ratio of HRT distances obtained direct video measurements was 0.985 (SD, +/- 0.108; SE, +/- 0.038).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Currently, myopic patients have the choice to undergo correction of their refractive error by the implantation of a phakic intraocular lens (pIOL). After pIOL implantation, progressive endothelial cell loss may result if the anterior chamber is too shallow. Because scleral buckling (SB) surgery for treatment of an RRD may in itself result in a decreased anterior chamber depth (ACD), this may become an important issue not only for the retinal surgeon who is faced with a patient who has both an RRD and a pIOL, but also for the refractive surgeon who should consider the potential problems of the implantation of pIOL in an eye that has previously undergone SB surgery.

It has been used to measure clinically the maximal and minimal diameters of both the optic disc and cup of 130 normal eyes from 66 patients and 33 optic discs from 20 patients with glaucomatous visual field loss. The disc area and neuroretinal rim area were derived mathematically for each eye. In the normal group the neuroretinal rim area was strongly correlated with the disc area (r = 0.89, P less than 0.0001). Only 9.1% of the glaucomatous group fell within the 95% prediction interval for the normal group, indicating a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for predicting the presence of visual field loss. Discs associated with mild field loss could be discriminated from those associated with moderate or severe field loss on the basis of disc and rim area measurements."

Indeed, OCT allows for the first time a non-invasive visualization of axons of the central nervous system (CNS). Reduction of retina nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness was suggested to correlate with disease activity and duration. However, several issues are unclear: Do a few million axons, which build up both optic nerves, really resemble billions of CNS neurons? Does global CNS damage really result in global RNFL reduction? And if so, does global RNFL reduction really exist in all MS patients, and follow a slowly but steadily ongoing pattern? How can these (hypothesized) subtle global RNFL changes be reliably measured and separated from the rather gross RNFL changes caused by optic neuritis? Before generally being accepted, this interpretation needs further critical and objective validation."

CD008803,0,23163271,0,Macular imaging for glaucoma using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography: a review.,"Since its introduction, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become widely used and accepted as an imaging modality to detect and follow glaucoma, with measurement of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) being the most utilized parameter. Up until recently, macular thickness parameters have not been commonly used in glaucoma due to results of earlier studies with time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) that revealed macular imaging to be inferior to pRNFL in the diagnosis of glaucoma. The recent advent of spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) has renewed interest in the potential uses of macular imaging in glaucoma due to its ability to better segment and measure individual retinal layers. Multiple studies have been performed in the last few years to investigate the diagnostic ability, reproducibility, and limitations of these new SD-OCT macular parameters. The purpose of this paper is to review the findings of those studies to assess the current utility of macular SD-OCT in glaucoma. Overall, SD-OCT has been shown to have higher reproducibility than TD-OCT, and though there have been some conflicting reports, the majority of studies seem to concur that the diagnostic sensitivity of SD-OCT macular parameters is at least comparable to TD-OCT and other SD-OCT parameters."

CD008803,0,24132671,0,Epiretinal membrane: a treatable cause of visual disability in myotonic dystrophy type 1.,"A wide range of ocular abnormalities have been documented to occur in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1. The objectives of this study were to investigate the macular and optic nerve morphology using optical coherence tomography in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1. A total of 30 myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients and 28 controls were recruited for participation. All participants underwent a thorough ophthalmologic examination, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of the macula and retinal nerve fibre layer. Images were reviewed by a retinal specialist ophthalmologist, masked to the diagnosis of the participants. Average macular thickness was significantly greater in the myotonic dystrophy group compared to controls [327.3 μm vs. 308.5 μm (p < 0.001)]. Macular thickness was significantly greater (p < 0.005) in five of the nine macular regions. The increase in macular thickness was due to the increased prevalence of epiretinal membranes in the myotonic dystrophy patient group (p = 0.0002): 48.2 % of myotonic dystrophy patient eyes had evidence of epiretinal membrane, compared with 12.5 % of control eyes. Examination revealed that 56.7 % of myotonic dystrophy patients had an epiretinal membrane in at least one eye. Visual acuity was reduced due to the presence of epiretinal membrane in six patient eyes and none of the control eyes. The presence of an epiretinal membrane was significantly correlated with increasing age in the patient group. We report an increased prevalence of epiretinal membrane in the myotonic dystrophy type 1 group. This may be a previously under-recognised form of visual impairment in this group. Epiretinal membranes can be treated surgically. We suggest that, in addition to a comprehensive clinical examination, optical coherence tomography examination is implemented as part of an ophthalmological assessment for the myotonic dystrophy type 1 patient with reduced visual acuity."

This review focuses on the diagnostic criteria of VKH disease, including some information on history, epidemiology, appropriate clinical and classification criteria, etiopathogenesis, treatment and outcomes. Expert review of most relevant literature from the disease's first description to 2013 and correlation with the experience in the care of VKH disease patients at a tertiary Uveitis Service in Brazil gathered over the past 40 years. The clinical manifestations and ancillary assessment of VKH disease have been summarized in the Revised Diagnostic Criteria proposed in 2001 in a manner that allows systematic diagnosis of both acute and chronic patients. It includes the early acute uveitic manifestations (bilateral diffuse choroiditis with bullous serous retinal detachment and optic disk hyperemia), the late ocular manifestations (diffuse fundus depigmentation, nummular depigmented scars, retinal pigment epithelium clumping and/or migration, recurrent or chronic anterior uveitis), besides the extraocular manifestations (neurological/auditory and integumentary). There are two exclusion criteria, i.e. absence of previous ocular penetrating trauma or surgery and any other ocular disease that could be confounded with VKH disease. HLA-DRB1*0405 plays an important role in pathogenesis, rendering carriers more susceptible to disease. The primary ocular pathological feature is a diffuse thickening of the uveal tract in the acute phase. Later on, there may be a compromise of choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium and outer retina, mostly due to an ""upstream"" effect, with clinical correlates as fundus derangements. Functional tests (electroretinogram and visual field testing) as well as imaging modalities (retinography, fluorescein/indocyanine green angiography, optical coherence tomography and ultrasound) play an important role in diagnosis, severity grading as well as disease monitorization. Though high-dose systemic corticosteroids remain gold-standard therapy, refractory cases may need other agents (cyclosporine A, anti-metabolites and biological agents). In spite of good visual outcomes in the majority of patients, knowledge about disease progression even after the acute phase and its impact on visual function warrant further investigation."

CD008803,0,14964569,0,Optic nerve head segmentation.,"Reliable and efficient optic disk localization and segmentation are important tasks in automated retinal screening. General-purpose edge detection algorithms often fail to segment the optic disk due to fuzzy boundaries, inconsistent image contrast or missing edge features. This paper presents an algorithm for the localization and segmentation of the optic nerve head boundary in low-resolution images (about 20 microns/pixel). Optic disk localization is achieved using specialized template matching, and segmentation by a deformable contour model. The latter uses a global elliptical model and a local deformable model with variable edge-strength dependent stiffness. The algorithm is evaluated against a randomly selected database of 100 images from a diabetic screening programme. Ten images were classified as unusable; the others were of variable quality. The localization algorithm succeeded on all bar one usable image; the contour estimation algorithm was qualitatively assessed by an ophthalmologist as having Excellent-Fair performance in 83% of cases, and performs well even on blurred images."

CD008803,0,22532220,0,[Optical coherence tomography in multiple sclerosis].,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that allows the different layers of the retina to be visualised in vivo. One of them is the so-called retinal nervous fibre layer (RNFL), which is made up of amyelinic axons from the ganglionic cells, and therefore part of the central nervous system. Recent studies have begun to examine possible applications of OCT in the field of neurology and, more specifically, the usefulness of measuring the thickness of the RNFL in multiple sclerosis (MS). In both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies it has been shown that a decrease in the RNFL is produced in eyes that are affected and unaffected by optic neuritis in MS patients, compared with controls. Several studies have found evidence of an inverse relation between the thickness of the nerve fibre layer and the neurological disability or cerebral atrophy parameters in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in these same patients. The correlations are, however, weak and sometimes contradictory. Although there are still many doubts that need settling, the role OCT may play in gaining a better understanding of the disease and its follow-up and monitoring seems promising.

CD008803,0,3761738,0,Changes in optic disc in ocular hypertension and glaucoma.,"Most ophthalmologists use subjective methods to evaluate the optic disc for abnormalities and changes that occur in ocular hypertension and glaucoma. We have developed new techniques that allow more accurate evaluation of the blood supply to the optic disc and of changes in disc cupping and pallor. To evaluate the blood supply we use the technique of fluorescein angiography of the optic disc. With this technique, we have found that fluorescein defects commonly appear in open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension and are more frequent and larger in glaucomatous and ocular hypertensive discs than in normal optic discs. Fluorescein angiography demonstrates distinct changes in the blood supply to the optic disc in the glaucomatous or ocular hypertensive eye. Cupping of the optic disc is measured by photogrammetry from stereophotographs, which provide three-dimensional measurements not only of the volume of the cup, but of the depth, the slopes of the walls of the optic cup, and the area of the surface opening. This technique also allows us to determine a volume profile of the cup: that is, its cross-sectional area from top to bottom. The volume profile characterizes the shape of the optic cup and shows distinct differences in shape between normal, ocular hypertensive and glaucomatous cups.

CD008803,0,23835664,0,Optical coherence tomography imaging in uveitis.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-contact noninvasive technique that allows in vivo imaging of the retina, choroid, optic nerve head, retinal nerve fiber layer, and the anterior structures of the eye. It was introduced into clinical practice two decades ago. Advances in OCT technology have been achieved by searching ultra-high-resolution OCT, adaptive optics OCT, eye-tracking OCT, and changes in signal detection technique from time-domain (TD) to spectral-domain (SD) detection. Today, SD OCT has become a part of routine uveitis practice. Apart from its diagnostic value in uveitis, OCT has enabled objective assessment of treatment response and provided predictive value for visual recovery and prognosis of uveitic entities. It is the standard diagnostic technique in the detection, monitoring of treatment, and determination of prognosis in uveitic macular edema as well as other inflammatory macular pathologies, including epiretinal membrane formation, vitreomacular traction, foveal atrophy, and lamellar/full-thickness macular holes. OCT has also shed light on the pathophysiology of several posterior uveitic entities. SD OCT has enabled visualization of four lines in the sensory retina which represent the external limiting membrane, the photoreceptor inner and outer segment junction, the photoreceptor outer segment and the retina pigment epithelium junction, and the retina pigment epithelium-choriocapillaris complex. Thus, we have gained substantial information about the pathologic and structural changes in uveitic conditions with primary or secondary outer retinal involvement. SD OCT has also provided invaluable information on the inner retinal and the vitreoretinal interface changes in uveitic conditions. With the introduction of enhanced depth imaging, visualization of the choroid and choriocapillaries has become possible. Therefore, OCT has become an indispensible ancillary test in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory diseases involving the retina and/or the choroid. As OCT technology continues to develop further it will provide new insights into the retinal and choroidal structure and the pathogenesis of posterior uveitic entities."

From 1984 to 1988, 18 patients underwent reconstruction of the carotid artery in an attempt to restore normal retinal arterial flow and, thereby, reverse or prevent progression of ischemic oculopathy. During a mean period of 21 months after carotid arterial reconstruction, subjective improvement in vision as well as a resolution in eye and periorbital pain was reported in 87.5 per cent of the patients. Measured visual acuity improved or stabilized in 94.4 per cent; macular photostress recovery times improved in 87.5 per cent, funduscopic examinations noted improvement or resolution in ischemic signs in 93.3 per cent and intraocular pressures improved in two of three patients. One patient experienced recurrent episodes of amaurosis fugax, which resolved after two weeks and did not recur. A second patient experienced an increase in intraocular pressures with visual deterioration, required laser photocoagulation after which the condition of the patient stabilized but only after significant visual impairment.

CD008803,0,18379619,0,Effect of chronic exposure to welding light on Calabar welders.,"It was generally observed that welders in Calabar, Nigeria did not always wear their protective goggles during welding. Since chronic exposure to welding light can impair vision this study was done to assess the effect of exposure to welding light on ocular function of welders in Calabar, Nigeria. There were 195 subjects comprising 110 welders (test) and 85 control subjects. Both groups were all male and had similar age range. The tests employed were clinical examination for ocular disorders, assessment of visual acuity, and opthalmoscopy. Test questionnaire was also used to record information on length of service, precautionary measures at work place, age and past ocular illnesses. The study also compared incidence of ocular disorders between the two groups of welders (arc and carbide welders). The mean ages of the welders and their control were not significantly different (27.53 +/- 10.0 vs 27.78 +/- 8.5 yrs respectively). There was a significantly [P < 0.01] higher incidence of pingueculum, cataract, allergic conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, and keratoconjunctivitis (arc eye) in welders than in their control subjects. However, visual acuity, incidence of pterygium and glaucoma were similar. Between the two groups of welders, the incidence of pterygium, corneal opacity and keratoconjunctivitis was significantly [P < 0.01] higher in arc welders than carbide welders. The incidence of pingueculum and glaucoma were however, similar. In conclusion, chronic exposure to welding light without adequate precaution may cause ocular disorders. Arc welding is more dangerous to ocular function than carbide welding. Length of service and age are predisposing factors to ocular disorders in the welding business."

CD008803,0,16023095,0,Auto-adjusted 3-D optic disk viewing from low-resolution stereo fundus image.,"Three-dimensional (3-D) visualization of the optic nerve head (optic disk) is very useful for clinical applications. It allows clinicians to measure the disk parameters more accurately and thus make the pathological diagnosis and progression monitoring easier. This paper describes an automatic, precise, 3-D optic nerve head reconstruction method from a pair of stereo images for which efficient steps including sparse-image registration and dense-depth recovery are used. A combination of two registration methods is used to detect the sub-pixel correspondences. The proposed method takes advantages of both the correlation methods which is robust to noise and the feature-based method on its accuracy. The searching range in image registration is auto-adjusted based on the previous iteration result. Only sparse matched points are computed to speed up the processing and the sub-pixel matching is used to overcome the problem of low resolution in the image. This is followed by the piecewise cubic interpolation to obtain the dense disparities and depths. Multiple windowing is applied here by first using the large window to obtain basic disparities followed by the small window and previous basic disparities to measure details. The result is then smoothed and displayed as the final 3-D shape."

Part 2: The odd looking optic nerve head in infants].,"This article describes the clinical presentation of the most common congenital optic disc findings: optic nerve hypoplasia, optic disc cupping and pediatric optic atrophy. Particular emphasis is placed on the often difficult question: is it a physiological variant or is it pathological? Do I need further investigations? Pragmatic clinical hints are given to enable ophthalmologists to recognize normal variants with greater certainty but also not to overlook congenital optic nerve pathologies. Congenital anomalies of the optic nerve (head) are more common than half a century ago. They can affect the visual development and thus the general infantile development to a large extent if presenting bilaterally. They can occur isolated, with other ocular pathologies and/or accompanied by systemic diseases or syndromes, such as septo-optic dysplasia, albinism, prematurity, small for gestational age birth, as well as due to toxic exposure during pregnancy (e.g. drugs, alcohol and maternal diabetes). In addition to clinical illustrations to distinguish between physiological variants and pathologies of the optic nerve head, the different diagnostic and therapeutic options depending on the age of presentation of the infant are outlined. The reader will obtain some guidelines for distinguishing congenital and acquired optic nerve pathologies. The focal point of the present paper is with infants aged 0-2 years where many diagnostic imaging and psychophysical techniques cannot be applied. Therefore, this age group is the most difficult to correctly discriminate between physiological and pathological findings and to decide whether further diagnostic and/or treatment steps are necessary."

They are commonly found in patients with panuveitis or anterior uveitis and are often associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Angle closure is rare, while secondary open angle glaucoma accounts for the majority of cases and often continues after the acute inflammation has healed. Monitoring should include tonometry, perimetry, and the objective assessment of the optic disc and nerve fibre layer. First-line therapy should consist of topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, followed by beta blockers, and then the alpha-2 agonists. Topical therapy must be monitored closely, as drug-related systemic side effects may preferentially occur in children.

CD008803,0,20655036,0,"Autosomal-recessive early-onset retinitis pigmentosa caused by a mutation in PDE6G, the gene encoding the gamma subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase.","Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common form of hereditary retinal degeneration, with a worldwide prevalence of 1 in 4000. Over 30 genes and loci have been implicated in nonsyndromic autosomal-recessive (ar) RP. Genome-wide homozygosity mapping was conducted in two sibships from an extended consanguineous Muslim Arab Israeli family segregating ar severe early-onset RP. A shared homozygous region on chromosome 17q25.3 was identified in both sibships, with an overlap of 4.7 Mb. One of the genes located in this interval is PDE6G, encoding for the inhibitory gamma subunit of rod photoreceptor cyclic GMP-phosphodiesterase. Mutations in the genes encoding for the catalytic subunits of this holoenzyme, PDE6A and PDE6B, cause arRP. Sequencing of all coding exons, including exon-intron boundaries, revealed a homozygous single base change (c.187+1G>T) located in the conserved intron 3 donor splice site of PDE6G. This mutation cosegregated with the disease in the extended family. We used an in vitro splicing assay to demonstrate that this mutation leads to incorrect splicing. Affected individuals had markedly constricted visual fields. Both scotopic and photopic electroretinograms were severely reduced or completely extinct. Funduscopy showed typical bone spicule-type pigment deposits spread mainly at the midperiphery, as well as pallor of the optic disk. Macular involvement was indicated by the lack of foveal reflex and typical cystoid macular edema, proved by optical coherence tomography. These findings demonstrate the positive role of the gamma subunit in maintaining phosphodiesterase activity and confirm the contribution of PDE6G to the etiology of RP in humans."

CD008803,0,16003900,0,Perceptual thresholds and electrode impedance in three retinal prosthesis subjects.,"Three test subjects blind from retinitis pigmentosa were implanted with retinal prostheses as part of a FDA-approved clinical trial. The implant consisted of an extraocular unit that contained electronics for wireless data, power, and generation of stimulus current, and an intraocular unit that consisted of 16 platinum stimulating electrodes arranged in a 4 x 4 pattern within a silicone rubber substrate. The array was held to the retina by a small tack. The stimulator was connected to the array by a multiwire cable and was controlled by a computer based external system that allowed precise control over each electrode. Perception thresholds and electrode impedance were obtained on each electrode from the subjects over several months of testing. The electrode distance from the retina was determined from optical coherence tomography imaging of the array and retina. Across all subjects, average thresholds ranged from 24-702 microA (1-ms pulse). The data show that proximity to the retina played a role in determining the threshold and impedance, but only for electrodes that were greater than 0.5 mm from the retina."
CD008803,0,21494659,0,Association of retinal and macular damage with brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis.,"Neuroaxonal degeneration in the central nervous system contributes substantially to the long term disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. However, in vivo determination and monitoring of neurodegeneration remain difficult. As the widely used MRI-based approaches, including the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) have some limitations, complementary in vivo measures for neurodegeneration are necessary. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a potent tool for the detection of MS-related retinal neurodegeneration. However, crucial aspects including the association between OCT- and MRI-based atrophy measures or the impact of MS-related parameters on OCT parameters are still unclear. In this large prospective cross-sectional study on 104 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients we evaluated the associations of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and total macular volume (TMV) with BPF and addressed the impact of disease-determining parameters on RNFLT, TMV or BPF. BPF, normalized for subject head size, was estimated with SIENAX. Relations were analyzed primarily by Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models considering within-patient inter-eye relations. We found that both RNFLT (p = 0.019, GEE) and TMV (p = 0.004, GEE) associate with BPF. RNFLT was furthermore linked to the disease duration (p<0.001, GEE) but neither to disease severity nor patients' age. Contrarily, BPF was rather associated with severity (p<0.001, GEE) than disease duration and was confounded by age (p<0.001, GEE). TMV was not associated with any of these parameters. Thus, we conclude that in RRMS patients with relatively short disease duration and rather mild disability RNFLT and TMV reflect brain atrophy and are thus promising parameters to evaluate neurodegeneration in MS. Furthermore, our data suggest that RNFLT and BPF reflect different aspects of MS. Whereas BPF best reflects disease severity, RNFLT might be the better parameter for monitoring axonal damage longitudinally. Longitudinal studies are necessary for validation of data and to further clarify the relevance of TMV."

Conversely, in subjects with untreated hypertension ( UH ) morning values of (i), (ii), and (iii) were all significantly elevated. Within each group morning and afternoon levels of systolic blood pressure (BP) remained constant but in UH the morning variance of systolic BP was elevated in proportion to the degree of hypertension. This disparate elevation resulted in highly significant correlations between levels and variance of systolic BP and IOP in the morning. These correlations were weaker or absent in the afternoon, and in normotensive persons at both times. These observations may explain the tendency of retinal vein occlusion to occur in the morning. Their relationship to the vascular changes of hypertension pose a problem for future study."

A particle filtering algorithm is presented in this paper to correct motion in a 3-D dataset by considering eye movement as a target tracking problem in a dynamic system. The proposed particle filtering algorithm is an independent 3-D alignment approach, which does not rely on any reference image. 3-D OCT data is considered as a dynamic system, while the location of each A-scan is represented by the state space. A particle set is used to approximate the probability density of the state in the dynamic system. The state of the system is updated frame by frame to detect A-scan movement. The proposed method was applied on both simulated data for objective evaluation and experimental data for subjective evaluation. The sensitivity and specificity of the x-movement detection were 98.85% and 99.43%, respectively, in the simulated data. For the experimental data (74 3-D OCT images), all the images were improved after z-alignment, while 81.1% images were improved after x-alignment.

CD008803,0,22535509,0,Reduction in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in migraine patients.,"Migraine is a common disorder and its pathogenesis remains still unclear. Several hypotheses about the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of migraine have been proposed, but the issue is still far from being fully clarified. Neurovascular system remains one of the most important mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of migraine and it could be possible that hypoperfusion might involve other areas besides brain, including the retina. This is, for example, of particular interest in a form of migraine, the retinal migraine, which has been associated with hypoperfusion and vasoconstriction of the retinal vasculature. Although vasoconstriction of cerebral and retinal blood vessels is a transient phenomenon, the chronic nature of the migraine might cause permanent structural abnormalities of the brain and also of the retina. On this basis, a few studies have evaluated whether retina is involved in migraine patients: Tan et al. have not found differences in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness between migraine patients and healthy subjects, while Martinez et al. have shown that RNFL in the temporal retinic quadrant of migraineurs is thinner than in normal people. The aim of our study was to analyze if there are differences in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness between migraine patients and normal subjects by studying 24 consecutive migraine patients who presented at the Headache Center of our Neurological Department. Migraine diagnosis has been made according to the International Classification of Headache disorder (ICHD-II). Patients have been recruited according to strict inclusion criteria; then patients have undergone a complete ophthalmological examination at the Ophthalmological Department. All patients and controls who met the ophthalmological criteria have been examined with ocular coherence tomography spectral domain (OCT-SD) after pupillary dilation. OCT-SD is an optical system designed to acquire the retinal layer images simultaneously with fundus confocal images. The statistical analysis has been performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences program. The Student's t test has been used to compare numeric variables between migraine and control groups. p value >0.05 has been considered not significant. We have analyzed 40 female subjects, 24 included in the study group and 16 included in the control group. Two migraine patients have been excluded. No differences have been found in the visual acuity between the two groups. Comparing RNFLs of a single eye per person in the two groups, we have found that migraine patients showed significant reduction in the superior quadrants (p < 0.005). Also evaluating both eyes per person there was a significant difference in the same quadrant between the two groups (p < 0.05). The result of this present study show that migraine patients have RNFL thickness reduction in the superior retinal quadrant compared with normal subjects. It is important to underline that RNFL thickness measurement could be a new interesting technique to evaluate the evolution of migraine and perhaps to study if prophylactic treatment could reduce retinal abnormalities seen in migraine patients. OCT-SD is a simple exam that could be repeated and then used for evaluation of headache progression during the time. Our study shows that RNFLs thickness does not depend on illness duration and frequency."

CD008803,0,22334408,0,[The most important signs of a glaucomatous disc].,"Glaucomatous optic atrophy is the result of both primary and secondary glaucomas leading to functional defects. Loss of axons and ganglion cells leads to a specific atrophy of the optic nerve head. Increased cup size and depth with loss of neuroretinal rim tissue are accompanied by changes of the retinal vessels and juxtapapillary retinal pigment epithelium. Changes of the retinal nerve fibre layer, caused by ganglion cell loss may be earliest signs of glaucomatous atrophy. The marked variability of optic disc size and form may influence the quality of ophthalmoscopic evaluation in extreme variants. Peripapillary haemorrhages and changes of pulsation properties of the retinal venules may give prognostic information for the course of the disease.

In order to improve imaging of the lamina cribrosa in the ONH with high lateral resolution and sensitivity, we implemented a complex conjugate artifact-free Fourier domain OCT (Fd-OCT) acquisition scheme with a reference arm-based phase shifting method. This allowed positioning of the lamina cribrosa structures near the zero path length difference where AO-OCT imaging achieves highest sensitivity. Implementation of our complex conjugate artifact removal (CCR) method required constant phase shifts between consecutive axial scans (A-scans), generated by continuous beam path-length changes from offsetting the pivot point of the scanning mirror placed in the reference arm. Fourier transform along the transverse axis and a filtering algorithm allowed reconstruction of CCR AO-OCT images. The suppression ratio of the mirror artifact was approximately 22 dB (at 18,000 A-scans per second acquisition speed) with a paperboard test target and an optimum phase-shift value. Finally, we reconstructed the three-dimensional structure of human ONH with enhanced depth range and sensitivity using CCR AO-OCT."

An overview of the use in optic neuritis (ON) and multiple sclerosis (MS) is presented. Literature survey of PubMed was carried out. RNFL thickness in eyes of healthy control subjects was 102.9-111.11 microm, in eyes affected by ON 59.79-85 microm, and in fellow eyes 82.73-99.8 microm. All studies found a significant reduction in RNFL in eyes affected by ON compared with fellow eyes and eyes of healthy controls. Two out of three studies found a significant reduction in RNFL in fellow eyes compared with control eyes. RNFL thickness correlated with visual acuity, visual field, low-contrast letter acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. Correlations were also found with the optic nerve area evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, neurologic impairment score, and increasing disease duration. One of two studies found a significant correlation with amplitudes of visual evoked potentials, neither correlated with latencies. OCT is a promising new tool for evaluating atrophy in patients with ON and MS."

CD008803,0,23366598,0,Anterior chamber angle classification using multiscale histograms of oriented gradients for glaucoma subtype identification.,"Glaucoma subtype can be identified according to the configuration of the anterior chamber angle(ACA). In this paper, we present an ACA classification approach based on histograms of oriented gradients at multiple scales. In digital optical coherence tomography (OCT) photographs, our method automatically localizes the ACA, and extracts histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) features from this region to classify the angle as an open angle (OA) or an angle-closure(AC). This proposed method has three major features that differs from existing methods. First, the ACA localization from OCT images is fully automated and efficient for different ACA configurations. Second, the ACA is directly classified as OA/AC by using multiscale HOG visual features only, which is different from previous ACA assessment approaches that on clinical features. Third, it demonstrates that visual features with higher dimensions outperform low dimensional clinical features in terms of angle closure classification accuracy. Testing was performed on a large clinical dataset, comprising of 2048 images. The proposed method achieves a 0.835±0.068 AUC value and 75.8% ± 6.4% balanced accuracy at a 85% specificity, which outperforms existing ACA classification approaches based on clinical features."

CD008803,0,11966304,0,Linear birefringence of the retinal nerve fiber layer measured in vitro with a multispectral imaging micropolarimeter.,"Scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) assesses the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) for glaucoma diagnosis by detecting the birefringence of the peripapillary RNFL. A detailed understanding of SLP requires an accurate value for RNFL birefringence in order to relate measured retardance to RNFL thickness, but current knowledge of this value is limited. A multispectral imaging micropolarimeter of PSC'A type was used to measure the retardance in transmission of the RNFL of isolated rat retina before (living) and after (fixed) 20 min of glutaraldehyde fixation. The thickness of the nerve fiber bundles measured was then determined histologically. As previously known from reflectance measurements, in transmission the RNFL behaved as a linear retarder. The retardance of the RNFL was constant at wavelengths from 440 to 830 nm and persisted after tissue fixation. In 37 nerve fiber bundles of 8 retinas, the average RNFL birefringence was 0.23 nm/microm before and 0.19 nm/microm after fixation, with an uncertainty of 0.01 nm/microm. The wavelength independence is consistent with a mechanism of form birefringence from thin cylindrical organelles. These results allow extrapolation of previous visible wavelength measurements to the near-infrared wavelengths used by SLP and validate the use of fixed tissue for RNFL research."

CD008803,0,7138329,0,Visual evoked potential and pupillary signs. A comparison in optic nerve disease.,"We measured the pupil cycle time, the relative afferent pupillary defect, and the pattern-reversal visual evoked potential (VEP) in 41 patients with unilateral anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) and 24 patients with unilateral optic neuritis. We speculated that the relative afferent pupillary defect would match the VEP amplitude and that the pupil cycle time would correspond to the VEP latency. We found a correlation between the relative afferent pupillary defect and VEP amplitude in patients with AION, but not in patients with optic neuritis. We also found that the pupil cycle time and VEP latency were weakly correlated, but only in patients with optic neuritis. In these two groups of patients with unilateral optic neuropathy, the most sensitive objective indicator of disease was the relative afferent pupillary defect. The least sensitive indicator was the pupil cycle time."

CD008803,0,23690973,0,Assessment and in vivo scoring of murine experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis using optical coherence tomography.,"Despite advances in clinical imaging and grading our understanding of retinal immune responses and their morphological correlates in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), has been hindered by the requirement for post-mortem histology. To date, monitoring changes occurring during EAU disease progression and evaluating the effect of therapeutic intervention in real time has not been possible. We wanted to establish whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) could detect intraretinal changes during inflammation and to determine its utility as a tool for accurate scoring of EAU. EAU was induced in C57BL/6J mice and animals evaluated after 15, 26, 36 and 60 days. At each time-point, contemporaneous Spectralis-OCT scanning, topical endoscopic fundal imaging (TEFI), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and CD45-immunolabelled histology were performed. OCT features were further characterised on retinal flat-mounts using immunohistochemistry and 3D reconstruction. Optic disc swelling and vitreous opacities detected by OCT corresponded to CD45+ cell infiltration on histology. Vasculitis identified by FFA and OCT matched perivascular myeloid and T-cell infiltrates and could be differentiated from unaffected vessels. Evolution of these changes could be followed over time in the same eye. Retinal folds were visible and found to encapsulate mixed populations of activated myeloid cells, T-cells and microglia. Using these features, an OCT-based EAU scoring system was developed, with significant correlation to validated histological (Pearson r(2) = 0.6392, P<0.0001, n = 31 eyes) and TEFI based scoring systems (r(2) = 0.6784, P<0.0001). OCT distinguishes the fundamental features of murine EAU in vivo, permits dynamic assessment of intraretinal changes and can be used to score disease severity. As a result, it allows tissue synchronisation with subsequent cellular and functional assessment and greater efficiency of animal usage. By relating OCT signals with immunohistochemistry in EAU, our findings offer the opportunity to inform the interpretation of OCT changes in human uveitis."
CD008803,0,24627251,0,Optical coherence tomography shows retinal abnormalities associated with optic nerve disease.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula in patients with primary optic neuropathy has revealed the presence of structural changes in the neurosensory retina in addition to the nerve fibre layer. Subretinal fluid has been documented in papilloedema and non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy, and may account for decreased visual acuity in affected patients. Subretinal fluid has also been described from other causes of optic nerve head swelling including diabetic papillopathy and papillitis. Drugs used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, such as corticosteroids and fingolimod can cause decreased vision due to central serous and cystoid macular oedema sometimes confused with recurrent optic neuritis. A subset of patients with various types of optic atrophy show microcystic changes in the inner nuclear layer on spectral domain OCT imaging. The pathophysiology and visual significance of these retinal changes remain unclear, but may affect the diagnosis and management of optic nerve disorders."
CD008803,0,25052998,0,Age-associated changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer and optic nerve head.,Optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim (NRR) parameters are often used as a surrogate for retinal ganglion cell content. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between these morphological measures and the aging effects on these structures.
CD008803,0,21150042,0,Normal-tension glaucoma (Low-tension glaucoma).,"Glaucoma is now considered an abnormal physiology in the optic nerve head that interacts with the level of intraocular pressure (IOP), with the degree and rate of damage depending on the IOP and presumably the degree of abnormal physiology. Diagnosis of normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), defined as glaucoma without a clearly abnormal IOP, depends on recognizing symptoms and signs associated with optic nerve vulnerability, in addition to absence of other explanations for disc abnormality and visual field loss. Among the findings are a halo or crescent of absence of retinal pigment epithelium around the disc, bilateral pre-chiasmal visual field defects, splinter hemorrhages at the disc margin, vascular dysregulation (low blood pressure, cold hands and feet, migraine headache with aura, and the like), or a family history of glaucoma. Possibly relevant, is a history of hemodynamic crisis, arterial obstructive disease, or sleep apnea. Neurological evaluation with imaging is needed only for atypical cases or ones that progress unexpectedly. Management follows the same principle of other chronic glaucomas, to lower the IOP by a substantial amount, enough to prevent disabling visual loss. However, many NTG cases are non-progressive. Therefore, it may often be wise in mild cases to determine whether the case is progressive and the rate of progression before deciding on how aggressivene to be with therapy. Efforts at neuroprotection and improvement in blood flow have not yet been shown effective."
